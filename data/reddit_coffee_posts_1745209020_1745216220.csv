I like to consider myself pretty down to earth. And while I‚Äôm a bit introverted, I love having a handful of people to form deep connections with. 

I live in California and have a small circle of people I consider myself close to. I enjoy gaming, cooking, writing music, and I know entirely too much about coffee. Also a huge sports fiend. 

I‚Äôd love to find some cool people to chat and connect with. If you‚Äôre interested, send me a message with a bit about you and where you‚Äôre from. ",2,1745215979.0,chat,0,1.0,False

My partner and I have the opportunity to visit Chicago next week for four days and we're so excited as we hope to move to the city by the end of the summer. I think we both suck at itineraries so I wanted to ask:

What are some local things to do and see in North SIde to get a feel of what it'll be like to live there? We've heeded the warnings about downtown and are staying at Hotel Versey in Lincoln Park. We've especially been interested in Uptown but ofc, open to it all, and that goes for activities and other must-see areas. We come from a shit ass area so even the thought of walking through residential areas with local coffee has me stoked lol, I'd love to hear it all.

1k46g8c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k46g8c,Extraction always too fast! [Delonghi ECP35.31 / Breville Smart Grinder Pro],"I recently bought a bottomless portafilter, as a replacement for standard pressurised porta on my delonghi.

I also bought a wdt tool, and a calibrated click tamper.
The bottomless portafilter came with a double basket.

So I grinded about 15g of coffee grounds to the porta. The problem is, no matter the fineness of the ground, be it 12 (espresso), 10,9,6,3‚Ä¶ the extraction time for a 40-45ml is always around 13 to 16 seconds. If I aim for only 30ml of espresso, it would be even faster than that.

The taste I think is a bit to the bitter side rather than sour.
So I did not know how much coffee I should waste anymore, should I set the fineness to 1?? I would rather not waste my expensive coffee beans if I could know what is wrong with this dialing in process. Maybe my delonghi is too old? (Its 8 years old). I suspect some channeling occurs, however I feel like I have tamped it so good that the coffee grounds are perfectly level and smooth, using this calibrated click tamper of mine.

I also attach photos of the coffee puck after extraction, if that can give any indication of errors.

Do you feel guilty moving into the new luxury apartments?,"So I had a get together at my new apartment and my cousin asked me this question ‚Äújokingly‚Äù I assumed. She asked ‚ÄúHow does it feel to be helping the gentrifiers‚Äù? Then laughed. 

To me personally I feel no guilt because I‚Äôm keeping my tax dollars in the city. Weather I lived in Newark, Harrison, JC, or Short Hills I would be living in a similar type of apartment regardless. I feel like staying here I‚Äôm giving back in a way instead of fleeing. 

On top of it all I started from nothing. Having no heat. To literally having holes in the bottom of my house because I used the same shoes for regular wear, Gym, and band. I couldn‚Äôt wait to make a little money when I got older to leave this city. As I got older I started to see the changes and slowly decided to stay as I got more into my career. I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs next.

My answer to her was no, I don‚Äôt feel guilty because whether I live here in this apartment or not, someone will. Why not it be someone who was born here who came from the hoods of the west and south ward and can enjoy these changes that the city is offering. The ‚ÄúG‚Äù word isn‚Äôt all bad. Honestly if it didn‚Äôt happen I would have left long ago. It‚Äôs even keeping home grown Newarkers here. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll stay here forever as I do want to experience different parts of the USA, but for now Newark is home as it has been since childhood. I plan to enjoy the new coffee spots and pop up restaurants the city has to offer in the meantime.

1k469yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1k469yl/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",1,1745214392.0,Write_Right,0,1.0,False

Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",1,1745214323.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1k468xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1k468xc/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",1,1745214275.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

1k468gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1k468gr/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",1,1745214227.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

She has been graduated from college for a full year now. We have had many great times, conversations, and memories together, but things have taken a turn for the worse over the past two weeks. Before I go into it, she has done this to me so far:

**1.** Made out with another guy at an EDM festival while we were talking (not dating), and I found out from somebody else + the guy posted a video of him/her on story.

**2.** She blacked out at my birthday party and embarrassed herself in front of my friends + threw up all over my house.

**3.** Got mad af at me after I told her I was going to grab a coffee with one of my close girl friends of 4 years (nothing sexual between us EVER)

And most recently, as of last week, **4.** I was scrolling through Reddit and followed her, so her replies appeared in my feed. It was a post from 5 days ago at the time asking, ""Do you still love your ex?"" and her response was, ""I think he still is the love of my life; we were just young."" This so angered me, and I went over to hers and confronted her first by asking, Do you ever talk or think about your exes? She replies no, so I whip out the screenshot, and she is stunned. She even denied it at first, saying she didn't remember posting that, but it clearly stated 5 days. In that moment, I broke up with her because I felt so betrayed. The worst part is that I took her on a weekend vacation the day she replied to that comment.

Just 12 hours later, I caved because I was anxious and heartbroken, and I asked if we could talk; she said yes. I then noticed I had been removed from ALL of her social media, and she kept up the pictures of her from our vacation a few days ago, but removed all of the ones with me in them. This remains true at the time of writing this post. We met up, discussed everything, and ultimately agreed to continue dating. Her explanation of the post was that it's normal to still feel love for your first love, but it doesn't mean you are in love with them. As someone who has also had a first love, we are still very good friends, but I no longer love her in that way, and it's mutual.  It felt so relieving at the moment because I genuinely do love her so much, even though she hurts me.

We went out the following night, and she was just so sus like turning down her phone brightness, and I saw her randomly text two people (idk if they were other guys) saying what's up. She was also drunk and took a bump or two from a complete stranger, which really upset me because I don't do drugs, and she knows that it upsets me. She then love bombs me an hour later while we're dancing, saying how she loves me so much, and she also says how ""she doesn't think she says it enough"" to me a relentless number of times.

Right now, I havent seen her since that night because of the holiday, but I am so overwhlemd with emotions, and dissapointed in myself for letting somebody treat me like shit. It just feels like I'm there for her convenience, or something, I'm not sure. I was happy to be back together with her, but now I am not sure.  I know I have self-worth and understand that the show must go on, but I want to make it work. You can wish for the best, but it doesn't mean it's the best choice. I believe in this, but it's strange being at the forefront of the problem when I've never been through something like this before. All of the people I've asked in my life have said that she's done so much to me already, that this makes it highly likely she could cheat, and I don't want to subject myself to this. She has a friend from home she talks to all the time who has done similar things she's doing to another guy, and cheated on him eventually despite him trying to break up. Although this is **not** her, her behaviors reflect a lot of the story I was told. The most f-d up part about this is that she knows I have some very personal things going on in my life right now, and I indirectly get treated like sht by her. I do everything I can to be the best boyfriend possible, and she even agrees.

I need some support right now because I'm unsure of what I'm doing. I'm wondering if I'm right to try to make it work, given my strong feelings for her, or if I'm wasting my last two weeks of college on someone who lacks emotional awareness for their partner (me). Please help, even if that means the hard truth, because I need it **badly** right now.",1,1745213898.0,survivinginfidelity,4,0.6,False

Is it to early to expect a rejection?," I (23M) met my crush (19F) at the start of September last year, during the beginning of the fall semester. It was in an art studio class with over 150 students. I was walking around, introducing myself and trying to make friends. I instantly felt attracted to her‚Äîthe way her eyes lit up when she talked about her passion for art was captivating.

Although we were technically in the same class, due to the large number of students we were split into two sections. She was in the other section, held in a different building. I kept going over there to hang out with friends, but I always hoped I might run into her when she was free. We only spoke three more times that semester because she was always busy‚Äîeither with one of the many clubs she‚Äôs involved in or working on a group project. I held back from approaching her too much, not wanting to distract her.

Before anyone says anything, this is actually something I really admire about her‚Äîhow focused and dedicated she can be. It‚Äôs incredibly attractive, and honestly, it makes me want to tease her sometimes.

Anyway, we got closer this semester because I was spending more time on campus, and we started sitting next to each other. As we opened up to each other, I eventually found out (in February) that she‚Äôs not really into physical touch‚Äîthat‚Äôs her least preferred love language. So, I even refrained from giving her a high-five.

As the semester went on, I started overthinking everything. There were so many moments where I wanted to ask her out, but I‚Äôd stop myself, pause, and change the subject. I kept doubting myself: Am I good enough? Is the age gap too much? Are we too different? Can I handle rejection? This is the first person I‚Äôve really liked and wanted to spend time with. It still feels strange to go out of my way to see someone. I‚Äôve had relationships in the past, but none have felt this warm.

In March, she started initiating things‚Äîasking me to go for walks or watch events together. My affection for her kept growing, and I decided I would confess my feelings. The opportunity came two weeks ago when she invited me to her dorm for some ice cream she owed me. As we talked, she brought up a crush she had last year‚Äîsomeone who sounded a lot like me, but it wasn‚Äôt me. That made me hesitate. I felt like it wasn‚Äôt the right moment to say anything. I thought she might think I was dumb for confessing right after she‚Äôd talked about a past crush. So, I stayed quiet. When I left, she walked me to my train stop and gave me a hug. That felt like the perfect ending to the night‚ÄîI was so happy.

Then on Wednesday, she gave me a cryptic message: ""You can't expect something to happen out of nothing,"" and told me to read between the lines. That sent me spiraling. On Thursday, I overheard someone say she might have a thing for me. So, I asked her to meet for coffee on Friday.

We met, and I started by saying I think I understood what her message meant. Then I confessed‚ÄîI told her I liked her a lot and asked if she‚Äôd be open to dating me. She paused, thanked me for confessing, and said she is into me‚Äîbut she‚Äôs not sure if she‚Äôs ready to date right now. That felt like a relief. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but it also wasn‚Äôt a rejection. As we continued talking, I told her when my crush started, and she told me she had been interested since last semester too. She said I had taken a long time to say something and that if she hadn‚Äôt made the first move, she would‚Äôve wondered if I ever would. She also mentioned she was expecting a kiss‚Äîor at least a hug‚Äîwhen she walked me to the train.

After that, we went our separate ways. I texted her, asking if we could hang out again sometime. She hearted the message but didn‚Äôt reply. I saw her on Saturday, and she didn‚Äôt bring anything up. I wanted to ask her to dinner, but she already had plans with a friend. Later, I texted her to see if she‚Äôd like to go for a walk in the park Sunday around 1‚Äì2. She replied: ""Thanks for thinking of me, but I won‚Äôt be free tomorrow.""

Now it‚Äôs Monday morning. I know I‚Äôll see her in class today, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do. My mind is running wild‚Äîshe probably doesn‚Äôt have time for a relationship, I waited too long, I wasn‚Äôt assertive enough, now I seem desperate. She did say she needed time to think and would give me an answer in two weeks because she doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on. But the waiting is driving me insane. I‚Äôm glad she has feelings for me, but is it too early to expect rejection?

The idea keeps creeping in‚Äîmaybe she‚Äôs trying to let me down gently. I keep trying to minimize my feelings to prepare for impact, but I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm even trying to think about what I‚Äôll say if (or when) she rejects me. It‚Äôs only been two days, but is it too early to brace for the worst?

Anyway, I‚Äôve been thinking about leaving a flower on her desk with a note that says: ""I spotted these and thought they‚Äôd brighten your day,"" because she once mentioned that kind of thing would mean a lot to her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### What Are Adaptogens and Why They Matter

Adaptogens are natural substances, mostly herbs and mushrooms, that help your body handle stress more effectively. When you encounter physical, mental, or emotional stress, adaptogens support your body's ability to maintain balance and improve overall well-being. Unlike typical supplements that target one specific symptom, adaptogens work holistically, promoting resilience and stability inside your body.

These natural wonders have been used in traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine for centuries. Today, science is catching up, revealing how adaptogens regulate stress hormones and support immune function. If you‚Äôre looking for a natural way to boost energy, improve focus, and feel calmer, adaptogens might be the right choice for you.

### How Adaptogens Work Inside Your Body

The magic behind adaptogens lies in their ability to support the adrenal glands, which release hormones like cortisol during stress. When cortisol levels are balanced, your body can better handle challenges without feeling overwhelmed or fatigued. Adaptogens also influence your nervous system, reducing feelings of anxiety and enhancing mental clarity.

Moreover, adaptogens help regulate inflammatory responses and improve cellular health by acting as antioxidants. This multi-layered support contributes to a stronger immune system and faster recovery from daily stresses. Since each adaptogen has unique compounds, combining different types can provide a personalized approach to health.

### Popular Adaptogenic Herbs and What They Do

Several herbs have earned their place as top adaptogens. Below are some of the most effective and widely studied options:

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for reducing stress and anxiety, ashwagandha also supports muscle strength and improves sleep quality.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This herb enhances endurance and mental performance while reducing fatigue.
- **Holy Basil (Tulsi):** Acts as a natural mood enhancer and immune booster.
- **Schisandra:** Known for improving concentration and combating oxidative stress.
 
Each of these herbs offers distinct benefits, so choosing based on your health goals will maximize the effects adaptogens can provide.

### The Role of Adaptogenic Mushrooms in Enhancing Vitality

Adaptogenic mushrooms are gaining attention for their exceptional ability to improve health. Species such as reishi, cordyceps, and lion‚Äôs mane deliver unique benefits that you won‚Äôt find in typical supplements.

- **Reishi:** Often called the ‚Äúmushroom of immortality,‚Äù reishi supports immune function and reduces stress-related fatigue.
- **Cordyceps:** Enhances energy production, stamina, and lung capacity.
- **Lion‚Äôs Mane:** Boosts brain health, cognitive function, and nerve regeneration.
 
Using adaptogenic mushrooms regularly can lead to improved endurance, sharper focus, and a calmer mind, making them a perfect addition to your daily wellness routine.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogens for Your Lifestyle

When incorporating adaptogens into your routine, consider your specific needs and lifestyle. For example, if you struggle with anxiety and sleep, ashwagandha or reishi might benefit you most. If mental fatigue or low energy is your problem, rhodiola or cordyceps can help boost stamina and focus.

Remember to start with small doses and observe how your body reacts. Adaptogens work best over time and are most effective when paired with a balanced diet, regular exercise, and healthy sleep habits. Consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement is always a wise step, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

### Simple Ways to Add Adaptogens to Your Daily Routine

Adaptogens into your daily life is easier than you might think. Here are some practical ideas:

- **Herbal Teas:** Brew ashwagandha or holy basil tea to enjoy calming effects throughout the day.
- **Powder Supplements:** Mix rhodiola or cordyceps powder into smoothies, juices, or oatmeal.
- **Capsules or Tinctures:** Use standardized extracts for precise doses and convenience.
- **Culinary Uses:** Add adaptogenic herbs and dried mushrooms to soups, broths, or teas.
 
Making these small changes can have a big impact on your energy levels, mood, and ability to manage stress naturally.

### Understanding the Long-Term Benefits of Adaptogens

Unlike quick-fix solutions, adaptogens work gradually to improve your body's resilience. With consistent use, you may notice benefits such as:

- Reduced anxiety and better stress coping mechanisms
- Improved immune system function for fewer sick days
- Greater mental clarity and improved memory
- Enhanced physical stamina and less muscle fatigue
- Balanced hormone levels supporting overall health
 
These changes contribute to lasting wellness and help you maintain a balanced lifestyle, even in demanding times.

### Safety Tips and Considerations When Using Adaptogens

Although adaptogens are natural, they aren‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. Some people might experience mild digestive upset or allergic reactions. It‚Äôs essential to buy adaptogens from reputable sources to ensure quality and purity.

Also, keep in mind:

- Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before use.
- People with autoimmune conditions need guidance from a healthcare provider.
- Monitor for any side effects or unusual symptoms when starting a new adaptogen.
 
By paying attention to your body's response and seeking professional advice, you can safely enjoy the benefits of adaptogenic herbs and mushrooms.

</div>Practical Ways to Incorporate Adaptogens Into Your Daily Health Routine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Easy Ways to Add Adaptogens to Your Morning Routine

Starting your day with adaptogens not only helps you handle stress but also promotes overall well-being. One simple approach is to add powdered adaptogens like ashwagandha or maca to your morning smoothie. These herbs blend seamlessly with fruits and yogurt, giving you a natural energy boost. If you prefer warm drinks, stirring adaptogen powders into your coffee or tea is another practical choice. Reishi mushroom powder, for example, can add depth to your coffee and is known for its calming effects.

Another great option is adaptogen-infused breakfast bowls. Toss in a teaspoon of holy basil (tulsi) powder into your oatmeal or chia pudding. This adds subtle flavor along with stress-alleviating benefits. Using adaptogens early in the day sets a positive tone and keeps your body balanced as you face whatever comes your way.

### Adaptogens Into Snacks and Meals

Adaptogens don‚Äôt have to be limited to drinks‚Äîthey pair well with many foods. Try mixing adaptogen powders into homemade energy bars or protein balls. Ingredients like cordyceps mushroom powder can increase stamina and endurance, so they‚Äôre perfect for an afternoon pick-me-up. You can also add adaptogen extracts into salad dressings or sauces, making it easy to enjoy their benefits without altering your meals drastically.

For those who love cooking, infusing adaptogenic herbs into soups or stews is a delicious strategy. For example, adding reishi or chaga mushroom powder into your broth enhances both flavor and immunity support. The warm temperature helps activate their healthful compounds, making each bite nourishing and restorative.

### Using Adaptogen Supplements for Convenience

If you‚Äôre short on time or prefer a straightforward approach, capsules and tinctures are ideal. Many health stores offer high-quality adaptogen supplements standardized to contain key active ingredients. Tinctures made from ginseng or rhodiola can be quickly dropped into water or juice. Capsules are perfect for those who dislike the taste of powders but want consistent daily doses.

When choosing supplements, look for products that list the herb or mushroom source clearly and specify dosage per serving. It‚Äôs wise to start with smaller doses and gradually increase, so your body can adjust. Keep in mind that results often improve with regular, long-term use rather than sporadic intake.

### Creative Ways to Enjoy Adaptogens Throughout the Day

- **Herbal Teas:** Prepare a tea blend with adaptogenic herbs such as holy basil, licorice root, or schisandra. Sipping these teas between meals can support stress relief and digestion.
- **Adaptogen-Infused Water:** Add powdered adaptogens like astragalus or eleuthero to your water bottle for a subtle health boost as you hydrate throughout the day.
- **Snack Enhancements:** Sprinkle adaptogen powders on popcorn, nuts, or yogurt to make your snacks more functional and enjoyable.
- **Baking Boosts:** Incorporate adaptogen powders into muffin or pancake batter for a nutritious twist on your favorite baked goods.

### Tips for Maximizing Benefits and Consistency

To truly reap the benefits of adaptogens, it‚Äôs important to stay consistent. Create small habits, like adding a teaspoon of adaptogen powder to your breakfast every morning or brewing an herbal adaptogen tea before bedtime. Tracking how your energy and stress levels respond over time can motivate you to keep going.

Remember, adaptogens work best when paired with a balanced lifestyle. Ensure you get enough sleep, eat nutrient-rich foods, stay hydrated, and move your body regularly. Adaptogens serve as supportive allies on your wellness journey rather than quick fixes.

### Safety and Personalization Considerations

As with any herbal supplement, consult a healthcare provider before starting adaptogens‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre pregnant, nursing, or have any chronic health conditions. Some adaptogens, like licorice root, can affect blood pressure, so monitoring is essential.

Individual responses vary, so experiment with different adaptogens to find what suits you best. Some people thrive with energizing options like rhodiola, while others prefer calming adaptogens such as reishi.

Adaptogens into your daily routine doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Whether you add a pinch to your morning smoothie, sip herbal teas in the afternoon, or take a convenient capsule, these natural herbs and mushrooms can become an easy and effective part of your health habits.

### Conclusion

Embracing adaptogens as part of your daily health routine can be a simple yet powerful step toward improving your overall well-being. These natural herbs and mushrooms offer a gentle way to help your body adapt to stress, boost your energy, and support mental clarity. By understanding what adaptogens are and how they work, you become better equipped to choose the right ones for your unique needs.

Adaptogens doesn‚Äôt require a major lifestyle change. You can add them to your morning smoothie, brew them into a soothing tea, or take them as supplements‚Äîwhichever fits your daily habits best. Over time, their balancing effects may help you feel more resilient in the face of stress and better able to maintain steady energy throughout the day.

It is the 41st Millennium.

The god emperor has sat broken upon the golden throne, ruler of man

On holy terra since the betrayal of his sons.

The world of men has shaken, trembled and decayed

In his ‚Äúabsence‚Äù, The Chosen Son now rules in his stead, weeping at what has become of his

father's dream, still he must fight. For as ever the dark comes, Beasts, Traitors, Xenos, Foulness

beyond mortal kine seeks to undo the living, Creatures from the outer dark devour all in their path.

Mortals do battle with the deathless at every turn. Upon these savage times, the greatest of

The emperor's creations, the Adeptus Astartes, do battle with all of this and more alongside

normal men from the Astra Militarum.

Who‚Äôs bravest wades into death's embrace with no fear.

Courage and bravery are still found in man, its light fades but is not broken. The ever-shifting dangerous warp tides, upon which the mighty vessels of the Navis Imperialis travel, leak

the reeking taint of corruption, must be navigated between solar systems.

Travel in this cursed realm is the pockmarked bedrock upon which the imperium stands.

It was with a look of long-suffering revulsion that Christopher, janitor of the Totem Imperial and self-proclaimed custodian of civilization's last shreds of dignity, announced to the front desk that he had just retrieved a used Johnny wrapper from the lobby floor.

Evan and Miranda‚Äîwait staff seconded to clerical duty for sins likely recorded in some forgotten punishment ledger‚Äîfroze. Their faces twisted in equal parts horror and fascination, as if they‚Äôd stumbled upon a crime scene at a cotillion. They could do little to mask the primal unease that crept over them like damp fog through iron grates. The object in question, glistening faintly in the lobby‚Äôs solemn light, had been unceremoniously deposited into an appropriate receptacle by Christopher, who muttered something about ‚Äúcivil decay‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôd never catch nobles leaving *this* behind, at least not where anyone might find it.‚Äù

The Totem Imperial, after all, prided itself on strict adherence to Imperial Sanitation Code 17.5B, which‚Äîamong other things‚Äîrequired that any organic detritus left by guests be disposed of before it could form a sentient colony.

‚ÄúHow in the nine rusted Hells did *that* get here?‚Äù Miranda asked, voice tight and too loud for the marble hush of the lobby. She was slouched low over the double-headed eagle inlaid in the countertop, the sigil‚Äôs golden veins catching only the faintest glimmer of the cogitator‚Äôs dim green glow. The ancient record-keeping system hummed softly, as if eavesdropping.

‚ÄúStaff or guest?‚Äù Evan added, dryly. ‚ÄúPlease say guest. I‚Äôd rather believe one of the nobles is discreetly engaging in battlefield prophylactics than think someone from laundry did this on their lunch.‚Äù

Christopher offered a snort that was half laugh, half cough, and entirely exhausted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the linen carts. Nothing surprises me anymore. Could‚Äôve been a bellhop. Could‚Äôve been one of the kitchen staff on a bad bender.‚Äù

‚ÄúGods above,‚Äù Miranda murmured, ‚ÄúWhat if it *was* one of the nobles?‚Äù

They all paused to imagine it. A duke with too many rings and not enough shame. A countess with expensive habits and careless hands. The possibilities were endless, and none of them good.

The ventilation fans overhead creaked in slow, wheezing circles, stirring the heavy air like a tired bureaucrat filing a grievance. Somewhere deep in the belly of the building, pipes clanked‚Äîperhaps in laughter, perhaps in warning.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Christopher finally said, drawing himself upright with the weary grace of a man who‚Äôs seen too much and been thanked too little, ‚ÄúIf it *was* one of the guests, at least we know the Imperial standard of discretion is alive and well.‚Äù

The three of them chuckled softly, grimly. In a place like the Totem Imperial, gallows humor was practically part of the uniform.

New Presidio: where the sky was a choking amber from orbital dust lanes, and the ground groaned beneath layers of concrete and compromise. A jewel of the Imperium, they said‚Äîif the jewel had been pawned, re-polished with industrial grit, and mounted on a crown of rusting steel.

The Totem Imperial stood tall at the city‚Äôs edge, overlooking a blast-crater-turned-garden that smelled faintly of antifreeze and incense. Inside, chaos wore perfume and demanded room service.

Evan and Miranda had barely recovered from the wrapper incident when the day truly began to unfold, like a cursed scripture recited one typo at a time.

At 0700 hours, the trade delegation from the Vintari Combine arrived two days early, citing a ""temporal accounting discrepancy"" and demanding immediate access to the wine cellar and three rooms that technically didn‚Äôt exist. The Vintari were tall, bone-pale, and had the patience of live explosives. Miranda faked a power outage while Evan scribbled room assignments in blood‚Äîor possibly a very old marker.

By 0730, the fifth noble scion of House Karshnath threw a tantrum in the atrium after discovering that someone had moved his favorite mirror. He screamed about aesthetic alignment, accused the bellhop of psychic sabotage, and flung a tray of synthetic pastries against a wall with the limp rage of the truly privileged. The bellhop resigned on the spot and attempted to join a nearby cult, claiming he‚Äôd rather scrub heretical glyphs than deal with ‚Äúthe spawn of entitled gene-vats.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the lower two floors groaned under the weight of construction crews stationed for the ongoing terraforming adjustment project‚Äîalso known as ‚Äúthe Great Cosmetic Re-leveling.‚Äù Rough men in exosuits clomped through the corridors, leaving boot grease, gravel, and half-eaten protein bricks wherever they went. They commandeered one of the ballrooms to ‚Äúrun diagnostics‚Äù and converted another into an unofficial fight pit. No one complained. They were too afraid.

At 0900, a delegation from the Austerian Concord arrived in full ceremonial garb‚Äîflowing black robes, breath masks, and matching obsidian flutes. They did not speak. They simply stood in a circle in the lobby for six hours, humming in harmony with the building‚Äôs ventilation system. The manager instructed everyone to ‚Äútreat them like furniture and not make eye contact.‚Äù Christopher said it was the most peaceful part of his week.

Back behind the front desk, the cogitator groaned under the weight of incoming guest data. Miranda typed with the calm of a medic triaging the dead. Evan monitored the security feed, which was currently showing a scion of House Vendel trying to fit a live avian predator into an elevator.

‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôll get hazard pay this cycle?‚Äù Miranda asked, not looking up.

Evan sipped reconstituted caffeine and smirked. ‚ÄúOnly if someone dies. Or a noble gets offended. Which, you know. Same difference.‚Äù

A shuttle landed too hard on the eastern pad. The shockwave shook the chandeliers. Somewhere, an espresso machine screamed and never worked again.

Christopher passed by, pushing a sanitation drone that was actively weeping lubricant. ‚ÄúGuest on floor sixteen clogged the bio-waste incinerator with a prosthetic. Not even asking why.‚Äù

Miranda nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúBetter that way.‚Äù

Outside, the sun glared down like a surveillance drone with a grudge, and inside, the Totem Imperial continued its slow descent into dignified madness.

The day dragged on, each hour a fresh torment in the grand theater of the Totem Imperial. The manager, a man whose soul had long since been ground to dust beneath the heels of nobility, was summoned repeatedly to perform the delicate dance of appeasement. Nobles, their egos as inflated as their entourages, demanded rooms that didn't exist. Lower-paying dignitaries were unceremoniously shuffled to lesser accommodations to make way for those of higher status. Refusal was not an option; to deny a noble's whim was to court death.‚Äã

""Get out of my way, you blasted janitor!"" one noble barked, his voice echoing through the marbled halls. ""Let my luggage servitor through! Move that blasted cart out of my way!""‚Äã

The staff endured the abuse with stoic resignation. Christopher, the janitor, muttered curses under his breath as he maneuvered his cart through the chaos. Evan and Miranda, the clerks, exchanged weary glances as they juggled room assignments and placated irate guests. The trials and tribulations seemed endless.‚Äã

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the lobby, the day mercifully came to an end. The staff, battered and bruised in spirit, prepared to face another day in the service of the empire's most demanding denizens.‚Äã

It was that rarest of moments‚Äîthe eye of the storm. Late into the night, the Totem Imperial had settled into a hollow, uneasy quiet. The construction crews had finally ceased their hydraulic bellowing, their exosuits stacked in a pile near the freight entrance like the corpses of defeated titans. The nobles were either asleep, sedated, or too deep in revelry to complain. Even the hum of the cogitator had taken on a gentler tone, like a machine whispering to itself in sleep.

In the lobby, Christopher leaned on his mop like a pilgrim on a relic staff, staring into the marble tiles as if answers might be found in their reflection. Evan and Miranda slumped behind the front desk, surrounded by half-sipped caffeine bulbs and a stack of requisition forms that no one would ever read. They were waiting for their replacements‚Äîif, indeed, anyone showed up tonight. It was the kind of silence that existed only in the tiny crack between hellscapes.

And then‚Äîhe walked in.

There was no fanfare. No procession. No security cordon. No raucous honor guards or shrieking nobility. Only a tall man cloaked in a simple, midnight-blue coat, worn loose over a body shaped like myth. His face, austere but not unkind. His eyes, ancient yet clear, scanned the room with the same precision a general uses to measure terrain.

Roboute Guilliman, Lord Commander of the Imperium, Primarch returned, son of the Emperor Himself‚Ä¶ walked into the Totem Imperial‚Äôs lobby like a man checking into a modest hotel before a business conference.

He had cloaked his presence‚Äîturned that impossible thing inside himself *off*. That thing which made mortals quake in his shadow, that radiant pressure of history, fate, and godhood. It was something all the Primarchs knew how to do, even if they never spoke of it. A quieting of the soul. A dimming of the fire.

He cherished the rare moments when he could use it.

Guilliman stood before the front desk in silence, hands clasped behind his back, waiting patiently as if he were any other late-night traveler. It took several long, stretched-out seconds before Evan realized he wasn‚Äôt hallucinating from exhaustion.

‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù Guilliman said, voice low, measured‚Äîcalm like a still ocean with depths you couldn‚Äôt fathom.

Christopher froze mid-mop. Miranda blinked.

The silence stretched again.

‚ÄúYes, uh‚Äîgood evening,‚Äù Evan finally stammered, checking the registry as if the man before him might be named *Mister Smith*.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a room,‚Äù Guilliman said simply. ‚ÄúQuiet. No political entourages. I won‚Äôt require anything special. No staff beyond what's necessary. I will not be receiving guests. You‚Äôll find I am... discreet.‚Äù

It was absurd. It was surreal. And it was real. This was *him*. *Roboute Guilliman*. The literal Lord Regent. Here, in the Totem Imperial, asking for a room like he was on sabbatical from galactic command.

‚ÄúOf course, sir,‚Äù Miranda said, her voice cracking like old parchment. ‚ÄúWe have... several rooms that might suit your needs.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù he replied, smiling faintly.

There was something about his presence‚Äînot quite comfort, not quite terror. It was like standing in the shadow of a cathedral that had decided to say good evening. No one screamed. No alarms rang. The world had simply tilted slightly on its axis.

As Miranda keyed in the room assignment and Evan fumbled with a keycard that suddenly felt wildly inadequate, Christopher muttered, ‚ÄúWell. That explains the weird atmospheric pressure today.‚Äù

Guilliman chuckled‚Äîjust once, a quiet sound‚Äîbut it echoed in the lobby like ancient bells in a crypt.

And just like that, history stepped politely into the elevator and disappeared into the upper floors of the Totem Imperial.

None of them would sleep that night. And none of them‚Äînot even Christopher, who had seen horrors rise from clogged incinerators‚Äîwould ever forget the moment when the galaxy‚Äôs greatest living myth asked for a quiet room and treated them like they were people.

Because for once‚Ä¶ they *were*.

The cogitator ticked quietly. Outside, the night deepened into its imperial silence‚Äîthe kind only found on worlds that bore the weight of civilization stacked kilometers high and choking on its own bureaucracy.

The front doors hissed open again, letting in the cold breath of a world that never truly slept.

‚ÄúNight shift‚Äôs here,‚Äù Evan muttered, relief and fatigue warring across his face.

Two figures entered. One was Galen, the usual night clerk‚Äîalways smelling faintly of recaff and industrial soap. The other was Kora, their friend, the other half of the night duo. She smiled as she always did: soft and tired, but present.

Only it wasn‚Äôt Kora. Not really.

The thing wearing her face smiled as though it had known how to smile for decades. The synthetic nerves underneath the clone-skin adapted perfectly to the familiar twitch at the corner of her eye, the subtle squint she always gave when she was trying to seem more alert than she felt.

The polymorphine assassin‚Äîone of the Officio Assassinorum‚Äôs Callidus agents‚Äîentered with the same casual gait, the same breathless shrug Kora always made at the end of her walk. Perfect mimicry, to the micron.

Inside, the assassin was quiet. Still. Calm. Its thoughts were fluid, trained, detached:

**Target entered the hotel without issue. The mask held. The aura cloak holds. No suspicion raised. Excellent.** **The Lord Regent has requested privacy. He is to be protected, not interrupted. Interference‚Äîinternal or external‚Äîwill be eliminated.**

‚ÄúLong night?‚Äù ‚ÄòKora‚Äô asked casually, stepping up to the desk and setting down her satchel with the exact kind of graceless drop the real Kora had always done.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the half of it,‚Äù Miranda muttered, handing over the console tablet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to believe who checked in.‚Äù

‚ÄòKora‚Äô raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSomeone important?‚Äù

Christopher, mop in hand, gave a small grunt. ‚ÄúRoom 2028012. That‚Äôs not just anyone. That‚Äôs *the* anyone.‚Äù

Evan nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pretty sure‚Ä¶ it was Lord Guilliman.‚Äù

There was a pause. Just a flicker of silence where the assassin ran a thousand calculations and countermeasures in a sliver of a second.

**Confirmed. They are aware, but composed. Excellent. They have not escalated. They have not interfered. They will not.**

‚ÄúDid he come with a retinue?‚Äù ‚ÄòKora‚Äô asked, voice just right‚Äînot too curious, just professionally interested.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Miranda said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the weird part. Just walked in. Booked a room. Wanted quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄòKora‚Äô smiled again‚Äîsoft, impressed, but not awestruck. ‚ÄúWell, I guess everyone needs a break sometimes.‚Äù

Christopher leaned against his mop again. ‚ÄúHe asked for no fuss. No disturbances. We‚Äôre gonna respect that. You two are just to let him be. He wants to be‚Ä¶ normal.‚Äù

‚ÄòKora‚Äô nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. No one bothers room 2028012.‚Äù

The assassin‚Äôs mind continued running beneath the surface.

**Maintain cover. Observe. Defend. Terminate any threat. The target wishes solitude; solitude will be preserved. These workers understand without understanding. Efficient. Loyal in their own way. Admirable.**

They continued the handover. Routine things. A malfunctioning keycode reader on the 8th floor. A room mix-up involving two rival delegations and one bottle of voidwine. Evan muttered about needing a week‚Äôs sleep. Miranda just wanted something fried and cheap.

And ‚ÄòKora‚Äô listened, recorded, filed it all away‚Äînot because it was useful, but because she was *her*. For now. She couldn‚Äôt afford to falter.

She would continue to be Kora until the Lord Regent left this place of temporary peace.

And when he did, the real Kora would be found‚Äîby sanitation drones or some unfortunate wanderer‚Äîface down in an alley three districts away, her throat expertly cut, her expression forever frozen in surprise.

But for now, she lived.

She lived in the weary smiles of her friends. In their trust. In their familiar rhythm. She breathed their air, drank their recaff, and shared their sighs.

And she would kill *anything* that tried to take this moment of peace away from him.

The slow, dragging gravity of the night shift had long since crushed any sense of temporal awareness in Christopher. The mop moved of its own accord now, guided by rote memory and caffeine residue. Somewhere along the line, the concept of minutes had become abstract‚Äîonly the tide of minor inconveniences reminded him the world hadn't stopped.

A construction crew staggered in around third bell, half-drunk and wholly loud. A hushed argument between two trade scions unfolded in the hallway near the gym‚Äîsomething about whose crest would take priority on a joint announcement. And, of course, the usual clandestine liaisons‚Äînobles slinking down back halls, playing at secrecy as if it made them less obvious.

‚ÄòKora‚Äô‚Äîor rather, the thing inside her skin‚Äîwatched it all with a quiet, clinical pride. The staff handled it all with quiet, weary efficiency. Not out of reverence or fear, but because this was their job, and they were damned good at it. The assassin respected that.

**There is power in mundane mastery,** she thought. **In not breaking when the galaxy burns, in keeping order in chaos. This place, for all its fragility, is fortress-like in its purpose. It stands.**

She had no doubts. The true Lord Regent was safe.

And when morning crept over the hive-towers of New Presidio, bleeding amber light through the sky-thick smog, the hotel began its slow resurrection. The night crew began their retreat, eyes haunted and hands aching, replaced by the morning wave of blissfully ignorant relief workers.

Then the manager arrived.

Pompous. Thin-tied. Full of self-importance and three steps behind reality. He entered the shift briefing like a man ready to conquer a minor province, datapad already open to double-check bookings and guest satisfaction metrics.

Christopher hadn‚Äôt even finished his coffee when the blow landed.

‚Äú*He was placed in a standard room?!*‚Äù the manager screeched, voice climbing into a frequency generally reserved for security alarms.

Miranda, who had stayed on a bit longer to oversee the handoff, pinched the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúYes. By *his own request.*‚Äù

Evan chimed in, still too tired to care. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene. Told us to just give him a room. Said, quote, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt rearrange the stars on my account.‚Äô‚Äù

The manager sputtered. ‚ÄúWe could have *evicted* someone! The lower-floor trade delegates! There are *nobles* in those royal suites!‚Äù

‚ÄòKora‚Äô watched him impassively.

Christopher, calmly sipping from his dented steel mug, offered the final nail: ‚ÄúHe said, and I quote, ‚ÄòDo not disturb others on my behalf.‚Äô You wanna explain to the Lord Regent that you ignored that order so you could brown-nose harder?‚Äù

The manager paled.

The silence that followed was thick and glorious.

And in that moment, the assassin inside ‚ÄòKora‚Äô thought, not for the first time that night:

**The galaxy turns on the efforts of soldiers and saints. But it** ***survives*** **because of clerks, janitors, and night staff who know when to shut up and follow orders.**

She gave a soft, approving nod to no one in particular, checked her fake ID badge for the shift log, and got ready to vanish with the first ray of morning light‚Äîanother ghost slipping between the cracks of a very strange, very human world.

And so it went, as all things in the Imperium eventually do‚Äîwith a long, slow, grinding slide from secrecy into spectacle.

For a few precious days, Room 2028012 had remained a kind of sacred silence. A pocket of privacy tucked inside the bureaucratic machinery of New Presidio‚Äôs most prestigious hotel. The Lord Regent, in his temporary exile from ceremony and scrutiny, had found in its thick walls and scratchy bedsheets something dangerously close to peace.

But peace, as ever, was unsustainable.

The comings and goings were quiet, but not invisible. No man‚Äîeven a Primarch‚Äîcould move unnoticed forever, not on a world like this. The Astra Telepathica picked up whispers. A data clerk in the local Administratum, sharp-eyed and bored, recognized a profile from a shuttle manifest. Rumors swirled, filtered, sharpened.

And then they arrived.

Not stormtroopers or inquisitors. Worse‚Äîpetitioners.

They came in trickles first. An old woman in threadbare robes who‚Äôd traveled three sectors to plead for her hive‚Äôs exemption from tithe reassessment. A nervous young noble with a gift-wrapped data-slate full of genealogical proof that his house had once fought beside the Ultramarines during the Damocles Crusade. A robed astropath with a letter of ‚Äúurgent clarity‚Äù to deliver ‚Äúdirectly into his hands.‚Äù

Then, of course, came the *gifts*.

Piled high behind the concierge desk like offerings before a god that had mistakenly wandered into the wrong church. Vases. Fruit baskets. Data-sticks filled with flattery. A bolt pistol in a velvet-lined box, inlaid with the aquila in mother-of-pearl. An antique chess set, rumored to have once belonged to Malcador the Sigillite (it hadn‚Äôt). A bronze statue of Guilliman himself‚Äîhorribly inaccurate, painfully sincere.

The staff stopped pretending by the third day. Everyone knew. Everyone had heard. The murmurs were constant:

*He‚Äôs really in there?* *Did you see him leave?* *What if I just knocked? Just once?* *What if he‚Äôs waiting to be found?*

Miranda spent half her shift intercepting nobles who ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù got off on the wrong floor. Evan started redirecting comms manually just to stop the console from shrieking under the weight of connection requests.

And the assassin‚Äîstill wearing Kora‚Äôs face‚Äîwatched it all unfold with the detachment of a hawk circling above a slow-building storm.

**Of course it couldn't last. Of course the quiet would unravel. The Imperium cannot help but notice power. It flocks to it like carrion.**

She stood, perfectly still, just beside the elevator. Watching. Calculating.

**This is when he is most vulnerable‚Äînot from threats to his life, but threats to his** ***intention.*** **The temptation to speak, to command, to** ***be seen.***

The Lord Regent had come seeking silence. Now the galaxy whispered his name through keyholes and across room-service trays.

And still‚Äîhe had not left.

He remained in the room. Quiet. Alone.

And the assassin began to wonder, beneath the programming, beneath the training‚Äîif the Lord of Ultramar had come here not to hide from the galaxy‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶but to see what it would do when he *didn‚Äôt* speak.

It had taken every ounce of his long-forgotten subtlety‚Äîevery whispered trick from the days of his youth, every covert lesson learned at the edges of his brothers‚Äô darker talents‚Äîto move unseen through the bowels of New Presidio.

Guilliman, Lord Commander of the Imperium, Primarch of the XIII Legion, wielder of policy and war alike, had spent days slipping out of a mid-tier hotel room in the dead of night wearing borrowed civilian clothing, a hood pulled low, his towering frame hunched just enough to pass for some off-world bodyguard, or a voidship bruiser between contracts. Even then, it had been a near-impossible thing.

The aura that clung to him‚Äî**that thing** inside him‚Äîfought him with every step. It wanted to be seen. To be *recognized*. It flared like a beacon to the weak-willed, the devout, the psychically sensitive. He‚Äôd had to dull it constantly, force it inward, the way his brothers had once taught him to do in those rare, quiet hours when none were looking.

But he *had* to know. *He needed to see.*

Not reports. Not briefings from planetary governors or filtered vox-feeds. Not scripted interviews or litanies from high-ranking Administratum advisors. **Real lives.**

So, he walked the hive-tiers.

He spoke to dockworkers on the loading platforms of suborbital lifts, to tech-priests repairing power stacks, to shuttle pilots with bloodshot eyes and bitter grins. He shared heated amasec with haulers and freight captains, drank recycled caffeine sludge with day-shift maintenance workers and the young tired mothers of hive kindergarteners.

They didn‚Äôt know who he was. Not really. Some might have suspected, if they squinted‚Äîbut who would believe it?

And what he heard‚Ä¶

*Glorious stories,* of faith in the Emperor and the shining hope Guilliman represented. *Fabrications,* concocted by opportunists or fools to impress someone they thought a visiting official. *Enlightening truths,* about labor quotas, resource allocation, minor corruption, petty suffering. And *horrors.* Endless, mundane, systemic horror.

Families crushed beneath debt. Scribes who hadn't seen the sun in five years. A water plant that regularly poisoned its own workers. Administratum errors that caused deaths‚Äîthen promoted the clerks who reported them the fastest. People who loved the Emperor, but hated their lives. People who cursed the Imperium, then wept in shame for doing so.

He had seen the war from space. He had seen the rot of Chaos and the blood of battle, and the brave and the fallen. But this‚Äî*this*‚Äîwas what had almost broken him.

**This is the Imperium I fight for?** **This is the Imperium I was resurrected to save?**

And yet‚Ä¶ they endured.

They *lived.*

They kept going, each of them, with tired steps and fading hope and quiet faith. The grand machine groaned and screamed and devoured, and still they turned its gears with bare hands.

He found beauty in their pain. Not joy. Not pride. But clarity.

So when he returned each night to Room 2028012‚Äîsometimes just before the early shift began, the smell of welding fumes still clinging to his borrowed coat‚Äîhe would stand before the window in silence. Not to look out. But to *not look away.*

It was on the final day‚Äîafter nights of quiet wanderings and whispered truths, of half-lies from tired men and unfiltered clarity from those too poor or too broken to pretend‚Äîthat Roboute Guilliman made his decision.

The masquerade was over.

He had seen enough. And more importantly, **he had felt enough.**

He stood in the center of Room 2028012, a room never meant to hold such weight, and activated the secure vox-channel embedded into the rosette on his wrist. It shimmered blue for the first time since his arrival.

‚ÄúThis is Guilliman,‚Äù he said simply, and somewhere in orbit, systems that had lain dormant for days came roaring to life.

‚ÄúI will require pickup. In full form. Send the One Hundred. Come down with the banners.‚Äù

There was a pause, then the quiet, awed voice of his Honour Captain crackled through.

*‚ÄúAt once, my lord. We descend in strength.‚Äù*





The sky split three hours later.

The landing platform beside the hotel‚Äîa small affair, used mostly for short-hop transport skimmers‚Äîwas dwarfed entirely by the arrival of the Lord Regent‚Äôs retinue. Gunmetal landers touched down with thunderous precision. Aquila banners flapped high above them. The Honour Guard emerged in perfect unison‚Äî100 warriors of the XIII Legion‚Äôs finest successors, clad in ceramite, capes, and the silent dread of authority.

Crowds gathered like insects to a flame.

By then, the news had already spread. The concierge‚Äôs desk was deserted, aside from a bell ringing forlornly. Nobles, commoners, trade envoys, off-duty Arbites, even construction workers covered in dust‚Äîthey pressed against makeshift barricades to catch a glimpse.

And then he stepped out.

The Lord Regent. The Avenging Son. The Master of the Imperium.

Ten feet tall in adamantine and gold, his cloak trailing behind him like a comet‚Äôs tail, the living embodiment of Imperial myth stepped through the automatic doors of the Totem Imperial like a man returning from a long, silent dream.

The assassin‚Äîstill in the shape of clerk Kora‚Äîwatched from behind the concierge terminal, silent and still.

**So. This is the end of it. The mask falls, and the world remembers it‚Äôs merely a stage.**

The crowd didn‚Äôt cheer at first. They stared.

And then, the cheers began‚Äînot from sycophants or arranged heralds, but from real people. Real workers. Those he had spoken to in the shadows. A pilot raised his cup. A maintenance man dropped his spanner and saluted with grease-stained fingers. A woman clutched her child and whispered prayers.

The Lord Regent nodded to them.

Not as a god. Not even as a Primarch.

But as a man who had seen them. Heard them.

And for a moment‚Äî**just a moment**‚Äîthe Imperium felt a little less monstrous.

He stood at the top of the steps, a silhouette against the rising sun, his cloak drifting like the trailing edge of a forgotten age. Roboute Guilliman‚Äîthe Avenging Son, the Lord Regent of the Imperium‚Äîpaused before descending into the chaos of fanfare, banners, cheers, and gunmetal ceremony.

And in that breathless moment, **he remembered why he had done this.**

He had needed to affirm *himself*. To recenter the core of what he was‚Äînot as a Primarch, not as a weapon of war or a figurehead of the shattered Imperium, but as something painfully and stubbornly human. He had needed to *feel* again. Not through divine mandate, not through gene-coded destiny‚Äîbut through shared cups of recaff, through the unremarkable familiarity of tired men in work-stained overalls swapping lewd jokes and cursing the price of food.

He had walked among them like a ghost with bones.

And they had accepted him not as a demigod, but as a *man.*

A big one, sure. A bit strange, maybe slow to laugh and too quick to observe‚Äîbut *a man*. One of the construction foremen, half-drunk and half-wise, had even offered him a job. ‚ÄúGood back, good hands. Got the eyes of a killer though. Still‚Äîwe can sand that down.‚Äù

They‚Äôd sat in the commandeered hotel bar, a place of cracked stools and overcharged amasec, where construction workers and diplomats shared elbow space because there was nowhere else. Where insults became invitations and fights became friendships, where noble sons were called bastards by freight lifters, and no one blinked twice because tomorrow they all had to work again.

It was there that Guilliman had rediscovered something he‚Äôd almost forgotten:

**The quiet, stubborn persistence of the human soul.**

Not the soul in a theological sense‚Äînot the flare of the warp or the golden fire of the Emperor‚Äôs will‚Äîbut that *earthy, mortal grit.* The spark that looked up from mud and blood and endless quotas and whispered, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make it. Someday. Somehow.‚Äù

That was what his father had tried to preserve. Not the bureaucracy. Not the thrones. Not even the vast stellar machineries of power.

But *this*. The tired laugh between coworkers. The slap on the back. The shared misery turned camaraderie. The hopeless man who still got up the next day anyway.

That was the core of the Imperium. And it was what he fought for. What his father had died for. What his brothers had burned for.

And in the stillness before the ceremony began, Guilliman *felt it again*. That inner light‚Äî*his father‚Äôs light*‚Äîpressing against the edges of his mind. It had been growing stronger since his encounter with Mortarion, his diseased brother whose touch had nearly killed not just his body, but his *certainty*. That light now burned behind his eyes like a second sun, a psychic pressure that refused to be ignored.

**It was the Emperor's essence.**

And every day it became harder to keep it from consuming what little remained of *him*‚Äîthe *mortal* inside the war-god shell.

He feared that soon, he would no longer *be* Roboute Guilliman, not really. Merely an extension of the Throne‚Äôs will, nothing more. That terrified him more than all the warp horrors combined.

So he had come here. To listen. To drink with laborers. To feel the ache in his back and the quiet dignity in their words. To once again be seen not as a saint, but as a *someone.*

And now, as his Honour Guard stood at full attention and the vox-pict cameras hovered overhead, Guilliman took the last moment to hold it all together.

And he began to speak‚Äînot in High Gothic, not in rehearsed declaration, but with a rawness that startled even his closest aides.

‚ÄúI have walked among you,‚Äù he said, voice clear, quiet, deadly sincere. ‚ÄúAnd I have seen why we must endure.‚Äù

He looked not at the nobles, not at the generals or priests. But at the line cooks, at the shift supervisors, at the janitors leaning on their mops and trying not to cry from fatigue.

‚ÄúTo you, who carry the Imperium not on banners, but on your backs. To you who suffer in silence and yet still hope. You are why I returned.‚Äù

And deep inside, where even he could not quite reach, that flickering human spark flared in defiance of the godhood pressing in.",1,1745213550.0,EmperorProtects,0,1.0,False

once i began taking this stuff again, i noticed my cognition became too good, like i became more confrontational as i used to be when i was younger, except im now 30, the most noted thing that happened was past memories and negative thoughts, negative feelings from a past relationship that ended in 2018, and last contact was 2021 briefly. i had already spent years getting over this situation, it was something that bothered me everyday,and i eventually got over it completely, it was nothing, non existing anymore.

after about 2 weeks on NMN, the entire memory and negative loop thought process about this person and relationship started happening again, every hour throughout the day. since july 2024 i have felt this way. to me it feels like the nmn is working too well, that its making me remember stuff i dont want to remember and i trained myself to forget. its creating new, bad, negative stress, and its affecting my life. 

  
theres an old video of jeff bezos where he talks about stress and confrontation and how stress only happenes because you didnt confront the thing that was bothering you , and it will keep happening until that confrontation happens.

  
i remembered that, and related it to my situation. the thing is i dont want to confront anything, its already over, im over it, but the negative thoughts and stress keep coming back even after ive dealt with it and buried it years ago. this feeling is overall negative, but its hard to say that NMN is the cause, and its hard to blame NMN because of the wierdness of this specific thing im feeling.

  
i want to note that my mind, thoughts, movements, gut, sleep, energy all feel better when taking NMN than when not taking it., infact when i take it it feels like drinking a coffee but without any caffiene , just some permanent higher energy level type gains, and more cognition almost like a racetam drug.

  
i just dont know why  i keep going through negative loop? maybe its my intelligence, wanting to confront that thing again? the NMN helping to wire my brain back to normal? was i fried before ? fried as in my cognititon , intelligence was slower so i forgot about things that mattered that i shouldnt have? with some new type of energy to put on the offense? i am very confused. is it unfinished business to tell this person? i know thinking that is wrong, like, its making me want to send a giant paragraph to this person telling the person how much distaste i have for them now, almost like that feeling tren gives you when you want to just confront someone, but without the anger, just 0 anger and all negative feelings like 'fuck, why did this have to happen' sort of feeling. 

  
sorry for all the punctuation errors, i just wanted to get this off my mind.

Around 2 years ago my friend had a job opportunity abroad, he recently came back and even I have missed him, we decided to go out for a coffee later next week. I was taking some time off last Friday when he texted me asking to meet up the next day. 

I was surprised since we agreed to meet the next week, so I asked him if he was okay, he just answered that his girlfriend left him the day before. I let him know I had time that day and went to a coffee shop to have a talk.

According to what he told me, he was getting ready to get engage with her this year after he returned, they were planning on getting married and move to another city to live together and create a family. He already had the engagement ring.

One day after he returned she spoke with him and told him she was stressed because of him returning, she also told him she was tired of not being his priority since he left her 2 years by herself, so she does not longer want to be with him.

I know he has been waiting to come back and get married with her, however I do not feel bad at all, I really think she is selfish and does not deserve him, he is a really sweet guy and he deserves better.

I heard him and tried to give him some advices, however I didn't tell him I am sorry because I am not, I really think he will get over it and meet a better girl, I also let him know I will be there if he wants to spend some time or just be listened, but I will not say anything I do not feel and he agreed.

This is the letter I never sent.,"We were traveling asia for four mounts thougheter and then split, For a whole month, I was traveling in China with a friend, and she was in Vietnam with someone else. That was the ‚Äúspace‚Äù she asked for‚Äîactually, I was the one who offered it, because she didn‚Äôt even know how to ask. She told me about it drunk in the back of a van with everyone on the way to a party‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Vietnam.‚Äù But deep inside, something in me didn‚Äôt sit right.

I tried asking over the phone, trying to understand if something was happening between them. And her? She was hurt. Played the victim. Told me I didn‚Äôt trust her, that I was making things hard, that I was ruining her peace. And I believed her. Or at least I tried. But something inside me knew.

Then we met again, after so much anticipation‚Äîbut something in the air felt off. There was this feeling‚Äîlike something was missing. Something I couldn‚Äôt even put into words. It just‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt there.

She went into the shower, and I already knew what I was going to do. I had made up my mind a week earlier.

I opened her phone. My hands were shaking. Went to WhatsApp. Scrolled down to the archived chat with him. And the first message I saw was: ‚ÄúDid you already tell him?‚Äù

My heart dropped. I was in total shock. Flooded with unbearable pain and uncontrollable rage. I felt the ground disappear beneath me. I think the shock of that moment is carved into me physically‚Äîit‚Äôll stay in my body forever.

I knocked on the bathroom door. My voice was trembling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in your chat with him. What did you do? What do you have to tell me?‚Äù

She answered from the shower: ‚ÄúWait a second‚Ä¶ I wanted to tell you myself.‚Äù She started crying immediately. Like she already knew.

She tried to steer the conversation toward me‚Äî Why I opened her phone. But I said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going into that right now.‚Äù

She sat on the bed and, choking on her tears, she told me: ‚ÄúHe started developing feelings for me at the beginning of Vietnam. He said we should split up so we don‚Äôt hurt you. But I was scared, I didn‚Äôt want to travel alone. And then, two weeks later, I told him I had feelings for him too.‚Äù

I asked when exactly. I tried to understand where it all began. Where it fell apart. When my partner stopped being my partner. When my confidant stopped being mine.

But she got confused. Changed her story. Said it was in one town, then later said another. She couldn‚Äôt give a clear answer.

And I said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. You lied to my face for a month.‚Äù

I went back to the phone. Looked for the truth myself. And I found it‚Äîraw, unfiltered, just the truth. I read their messages:

‚ÄúI have a hole in my heart shaped like you. And it‚Äôs pretty big. Because you‚Äôre tall.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you, you need to think about what you really want.‚Äù She sent him a photo of her bed with the words: ‚ÄúFirst night without you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI miss you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop thinking about you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the talk doesn‚Äôt go well, at least I‚Äôll have something to go back to.‚Äù

He wanted to cut things off. She begged him not to. Just to keep talking a bit more. Not to unfollow her. She became dependent on him. Started treating him the same way she treated me.

I kept reading. More and more. Every word etched itself into me. To this day, those messages echo in my head. In moments of pain, in moments of rage. Like knives in my chest. I can‚Äôt stop replaying the timeline in my mind‚Äî What kind of love she gave him, while all I got was distance and coldness.

And her? She sat there crying. For hours. Said she was sorry‚Äîbut never said for what.

Said she was stupid. That she made a mistake. Like it was a one-time slip. Said she lost the most important thing in her life‚Äî But didn‚Äôt do a thing to try and get it back.

Said he filled the space I left behind. Even though all I wanted was to be there. I wanted one deep phone call from her. To hear what she was feeling. I made space for her‚Äîonly because she asked. But she chose him. Not me. She shared with him, not with me. Even told him things I had told her‚Äî That I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night. That I felt needy. And she never apologized for any of it.

She apologized for not sharing things with me‚Äî But not for lying to me. Not for making me feel jealous, needy, worthless. Not for making me feel like I was ruining everything for asking questions.

She apologized for not showing enough affection‚Äî But not for not seeing me at all. She never explained what really happened between them, never told me the truth. Never took full responsibility. Never admitted that she was unfaithful.

And it‚Äôs already been two weeks. A week since she‚Äôs been unblocked. And during that week, I‚Äôve been arguing with myself‚Äî Is there a place for forgiveness? Is it worth fighting for this relationship? Should I send a message asking: ‚ÄúDo you still think we could meet and try again?‚Äù Because that‚Äôs still what I want‚Äîbut not what I need. There‚Äôs a thin line between want and need. And I almost crossed it, more than once. For her. For what she was to me. For what I wanted us to be.

But the truth still lives. And in that whole week, she never once asked how I‚Äôm doing. Even though I asked her not to send messages ‚Äî That hurts so much. I hoped that after everything we went through, I‚Äôd get a message. Something small. Just a ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù Or maybe a real apology. Some ownership.

People told me she‚Äôs selfish. Immature. That everything she did shows she was only thinking of herself. At first, I fought against that so hard. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. But now? I‚Äôm not so sure. And I keep replaying it all‚Äî Like a film stuck on repeat.

I keep seeing us‚Äî Drinking coffee on the balcony. Going on our monthly hikes. Watching shows in her room. Our loving conversations when I was traveling alone. Tokyo‚Äîthose days were the most magical of my life. That quiet little farm. The rock at the end of the trail. How much I loved her. How good it was. How much I wanted it to keep going.

Then things changed. She became bitter about being with me ‚Äúall the time.‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt know how to help. Every time we met people, I tried to be social, kind. When we met new friends, I was as welcoming as I could be‚Äî Even offered them to join us for things. But she saw me as a barrier to connection.

All the coldness I got from her in those last weeks. How she always went to hang in others‚Äô rooms, running away from moments with me.

She even told me, multiple times, that if I were bald, or not handsome, She wouldn‚Äôt have dated me.

Later, every time I felt like shit and tried to open up to her‚Äî Instead of comfort, I got frustration and criticism. I imagined her lying next to me in bed instead of a friend‚Äîholding me‚Äî While she was trying not to hold him.

I wanted her to travel alone, to feel free, independent. But she just walked into someone else‚Äôs arms.

Most of the time now, I just want to send a message of love. Ask how she is‚Äîwithout anger, without drama. Just to know: How is she feeling? What is she doing? How is she healing?

Sometimes, I just want one last hug.

Other times, all I want is the truth. A real, detailed apology. To hear the whole story‚Äîhow she saw it, what she felt, what made her do it. No pity. No self-protection. Just brutal, honest truth. That‚Äôs the bare minimum I deserve.

Are these new tariffs being pushed by political elites just another clever way for corporate oligarchs to raise prices on everyday Canadians and Americans, permanently?

Here's the logic:

1. Tariffs are slapped on imports, supposedly to ‚Äúdefend Canadian and American industries‚Äù or ‚Äúget tough on foreign actors.‚Äù
2. Canadian and American businesses affected by those tariffs pass the added costs on to us, the consumers.
3. Prices go up, and guess what? Even if the tariffs are removed later, the prices usually stay the same, the removal doesn't lower prices. Why would they? Corporations aren‚Äôt in the habit of giving up profit margins once the public has adjusted.

So who benefits?  
Not the average Canadian or American facing higher costs for essentials.  
Not small businesses squeezed by supply chain inflation.  
Certainly not low-income families who already struggle to afford groceries, appliances, or vehicles.

But large corporations and oligarchs? The ones who can absorb short-term bumps, restructure their pricing, and profit from long-term markups? They‚Äôre laughing all the way to the bank.

It's worth discussing whether these tariffs are really about economic protection or just another tactic in the same old game: inflate prices, blame ‚Äúforeign interference,‚Äù and quietly lock in profits while Canadians and Americans pay the tab.

This is the letter I never sent.,"We were traveling asia for four mounts thougheter and then split, For a whole month, I was traveling in China with a friend, and she was in Vietnam with someone else.
That was the ‚Äúspace‚Äù she asked for‚Äîactually, I was the one who offered it, because she didn‚Äôt even know how to ask.
She told me about it drunk in the back of a van with everyone on the way to a party‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Vietnam.‚Äù
But deep inside, something in me didn‚Äôt sit right.

I tried asking over the phone, trying to understand if something was happening between them.
And her? She was hurt. Played the victim.
Told me I didn‚Äôt trust her, that I was making things hard, that I was ruining her peace.
And I believed her. Or at least I tried.
But something inside me knew.

Then we met again, after so much anticipation‚Äîbut something in the air felt off.
There was this feeling‚Äîlike something was missing. Something I couldn‚Äôt even put into words. It just‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt there.

She went into the shower, and I already knew what I was going to do.
I had made up my mind a week earlier.

I opened her phone. My hands were shaking.
Went to WhatsApp.
Scrolled down to the archived chat with him.
And the first message I saw was:
‚ÄúDid you already tell him?‚Äù

My heart dropped.
I was in total shock.
Flooded with unbearable pain and uncontrollable rage.
I felt the ground disappear beneath me.
I think the shock of that moment is carved into me physically‚Äîit‚Äôll stay in my body forever.

I knocked on the bathroom door. My voice was trembling.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in your chat with him. What did you do? What do you have to tell me?‚Äù

She answered from the shower:
‚ÄúWait a second‚Ä¶ I wanted to tell you myself.‚Äù
She started crying immediately. Like she already knew.

She tried to steer the conversation toward me‚Äî
Why I opened her phone.
But I said:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going into that right now.‚Äù

She sat on the bed and, choking on her tears, she told me:
‚ÄúHe started developing feelings for me at the beginning of Vietnam.
He said we should split up so we don‚Äôt hurt you.
But I was scared, I didn‚Äôt want to travel alone.
And then, two weeks later, I told him I had feelings for him too.‚Äù

I asked when exactly.
I tried to understand where it all began.
Where it fell apart.
When my partner stopped being my partner.
When my confidant stopped being mine.

But she got confused. Changed her story.
Said it was in one town, then later said another.
She couldn‚Äôt give a clear answer.

And I said:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. You lied to my face for a month.‚Äù

I went back to the phone.
Looked for the truth myself.
And I found it‚Äîraw, unfiltered, just the truth.
I read their messages:

‚ÄúI have a hole in my heart shaped like you. And it‚Äôs pretty big. Because you‚Äôre tall.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, you need to think about what you really want.‚Äù
She sent him a photo of her bed with the words:
‚ÄúFirst night without you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI miss you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop thinking about you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf the talk doesn‚Äôt go well, at least I‚Äôll have something to go back to.‚Äù

He wanted to cut things off.
She begged him not to.
Just to keep talking a bit more.
Not to unfollow her.
She became dependent on him.
Started treating him the same way she treated me.

I kept reading.
More and more.
Every word etched itself into me.
To this day, those messages echo in my head.
In moments of pain, in moments of rage.
Like knives in my chest.
I can‚Äôt stop replaying the timeline in my mind‚Äî
What kind of love she gave him, while all I got was distance and coldness.

And her?
She sat there crying. For hours.
Said she was sorry‚Äîbut never said for what.

Said she was stupid. That she made a mistake.
Like it was a one-time slip.
Said she lost the most important thing in her life‚Äî
But didn‚Äôt do a thing to try and get it back.

Said he filled the space I left behind.
Even though all I wanted was to be there.
I wanted one deep phone call from her.
To hear what she was feeling.
I made space for her‚Äîonly because she asked.
But she chose him. Not me.
She shared with him, not with me.
Even told him things I had told her‚Äî
That I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night. That I felt needy.
And she never apologized for any of it.

She apologized for not sharing things with me‚Äî
But not for lying to me.
Not for making me feel jealous, needy, worthless.
Not for making me feel like I was ruining everything for asking questions.

She apologized for not showing enough affection‚Äî
But not for not seeing me at all.
She never explained what really happened between them, never told me the truth.
Never took full responsibility.
Never admitted that she was unfaithful.

And it‚Äôs already been two weeks.
A week since she‚Äôs been unblocked.
And during that week, I‚Äôve been arguing with myself‚Äî
Is there a place for forgiveness?
Is it worth fighting for this relationship?
Should I send a message asking:
‚ÄúDo you still think we could meet and try again?‚Äù
Because that‚Äôs still what I want‚Äîbut not what I need.
There‚Äôs a thin line between want and need.
And I almost crossed it, more than once.
For her.
For what she was to me.
For what I wanted us to be.

But the truth still lives.
And in that whole week, she never once asked how I‚Äôm doing.
Even though I asked her not to send messages ‚Äî
That hurts so much.
I hoped that after everything we went through, I‚Äôd get a message.
Something small.
Just a ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù
Or maybe a real apology. Some ownership.

People told me she‚Äôs selfish. Immature.
That everything she did shows she was only thinking of herself.
At first, I fought against that so hard.
I didn‚Äôt want to believe it.
But now? I‚Äôm not so sure.
And I keep replaying it all‚Äî
Like a film stuck on repeat.

I keep seeing us‚Äî
Drinking coffee on the balcony.
Going on our monthly hikes.
Watching shows in her room.
Our loving conversations when I was traveling alone.

If they invite me and wanna date but act passive like aw I don‚Äôt know places you can select you can search its also bad. Or if they complain about bill road etc also negative. If they act stingy and wanna spend hours with just one drink its also disgusting for me. If they do lovebombing like try to touch me or kiss me or say wanna marry relationship and have feelings etc also its toxic. If they hide phone or talk far or always look phone they are also toxic. If they give promises but don‚Äôt keep them its toxic too. Also mostly they lie about themselves to impress me.

1. Stay in Gion/South Higashiyama in Kyoto as you'll be able to wander the historical streets in the early morning/evening when the crowds leave without having to commit to taking a train/bus. Your stay will probably be chock full of activities so you won't have to experience it in the daytime. 

2. Bookings for restaurants aren't needed much in Tokyo unless there are specific ones you want to go - I'd say book dinners for half your days and find places for the rest. I recommend XEX Atago, Shinpachi Shokudo (chain), and Hatsuogawa. I also recommend Onibus coffee and Woodberry coffee for caffeine. 

3. Bookings for dinners are necessary in Takayama, as it's small town with lots of tourists. I recommend Kyoya, I also recommend don for breakfast.

4. Do not book anything in Osaka. I'm telling you, within reason, places that you walk into are better than places you can research.

5. Book pretty much everything in Kyoto. There were days I skipped dinner because there weren't any restaurants that had availability/ that were even open. I recommend gion mametora and okuoka. 

6. If you like matcha by any means, do not drink coffee in kyoto. I recommend Tsujiri, Gokago and Mo-an.

7. Nara is infinitely worth a daytrip. The deer are so fun to feed, looked healthy, and their attitudes were so funny. If you don't want to be harassed put away your senbei and venture further into the park, there they're more peaceful. I recommend Mizuya chaya for lunch because it's located deep into the park which means you don't have to walk back into town. It's also a prime deer watching spot and is located next to a cute stream. Todai-ji temple is definitely worth going inside. It's so majestic and is less busy from the inner grounds as you have to pay to get in. 

8. I didn't find much of a difference in business levels based on the day of the week tourist-wise. Obviously restaurants will be busier on fridays and saturdays with locals but us tourists forget what day it is, we don't care about weekends. 

9. Goshuin are better collectibles than eki stamps. Eki stamps are just stressful to look for and half the time you can't find them. Also I usually just wanted to get to the train to minimise travel time so I only ended up with around 5. 

10. Teamlab planets wasn't worth it. Sure, it was fun, but it was so busy and touristy, you were always 'in someone's picture' and the installations weren't that interesting. It's hard for something to be immersive if there's 10 tour groups going through at any one time.

11. Ginza was also not that interesting. Apart from itoya and cafe de l'ambre, which lived up to the hype, it's just all the same luxury stores you can get in any big city. Even the uniqlo and muji flagships didn't seem to have much more variety than the regular ones, which was disappointing. We ended up spending about 3 hours shopping, including lunch, before going home.

12. Totoro cream puffs ARE worth it. It's in a small wooded area of setagaya and it's really cute and retro. The online ordering is a bit clunky though as it seems to tell you cream puffs are 'sold out' when they aren't - so you have to talk to staff. 

13. Osaka aquarium blew my mind. The ringed seals and the whale sharks were so so so cool and my only gripe was the dolphins. 

14. Osaka castle was also worth it. Don't go inside, but take the boat or road train tours around the grounds for great photos. It helps that it was a nice sunny day and the cherry blossoms were out when we went, though.

15. The best cherry blossoms were at Shinjuku Gyoen Gardens, Meguro River, Osaka , Kyoto Botanicals (have a picnic there it's less busy than other gardens), and the philosopher's path. Also don't fret about missing peak dates, I missed the peak date in Kyoto by a good few days and the cherry blossoms were the same as everywhere else, and that was after some heavy rain. It was only after one final rainy day that all the petals fell, which was on the 11th of April (peak date was on the 6th).

16. Yachimun no sato in Okinawa was amazing. Pick up some pottery - bowls, sake sets, shisa statues etc. It's all so well made and there's some good food - clay coffee (not made with clay) for coffee and cheesecake and Ë™≠Ë∞∑Â±±Á™Ø ÈáëÂüéÂ∑•Êàø Ê£Æ„ÅÆËå∂Â±ã (Yomitanzan Kiln Kinjo Studio Mori no Chaya) for Okinawa style okonomiyaki - the more I eat okonomiyaki the more I realise that every style beats out Osaka style.

That's pretty much all I can be assed to write today - here's my list of locations (not everything I ended up going to so don't trust the list too much): [https://maps.app.goo.gl/QDEPf33chgW4ZFMcA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QDEPf33chgW4ZFMcA)

So, take a break from the noise, grab a coffee, and let's dive into the power of silence together!

‚Ä¢ Silence allows us to truly listen: Amidst the constant chatter and overwhelming noise, how often do we actually take the time to listen? Embracing silence opens the door to active listening. It enables us to absorb the words and emotions of others without solely focusing on our response. By doing so, we foster deeper connections with our loved ones and gain a better understanding of their needs.

‚Ä¢ Silence sparks creativity: Have you ever noticed how some of your best ideas come to you when you're in a state of quiet contemplation? Silence gives our minds the necessary space to process and make connections. It allows our thoughts and ideas to flow freely, leading to innovative breakthroughs. So, step away from the screens and embrace the silence to unleash your creative potential.

‚Ä¢ Silence cultivates self-awareness: We live in a noisy world that bombards us with distractions. In silence, we detach ourselves from this chaos and tune in to our thoughts and emotions. Through self-reflection, we attain a heightened sense of self-awareness. We become more attuned to our strengths, weaknesses, and desires, which empowers us to make more informed decisions and live a life aligned with our values.

‚Ä¢ Silence fuels inner peace: Seeking moments of quietude calms our mind and nurtures a sense of inner peace. It gives us the opportunity to disconnect from external stimuli and recharge our batteries. Embracing silence allows us to slow down, be present in the moment, and appreciate life's simple pleasures.

This morning I went to brunch at my parents house for Easter. It was a relatively small get together, with only my parents, siblings and a couple cousins who were in the area. I think maybe 12 people total including kids.

Due to the magority of us being adults, there was a decent amount of alcohol being passed around. I feel the need to mention this for later.

A little before brunch, my mom surprised me, my brother and my sister (26F) with Easter baskets for us both. It wasn't anything fancy, just some chocolate and socks but I loved it anyways.

I thanked my mom and I mentioned it was funny she thought to do this because I did something similar for my fianc√© that morning (he was not at the brunch because of his job). While we were talking my sister came in to refill her drink and heard us talking and decided to jump into the conversation. 

She asked if I'd made her a basket too. At first I thought she was joking but when I tried to laugh it off she got upset with me. (For context, we haven't been on the best terms for a while now, but I'm not getting into that). 

She started poking fun at me, calling me lazy and forgetful and a bad sister. I was got upset and my mom tried to meditate by offering my sister another drink, but my sister pushed passed her and tried to swat at my face. 

Now I think it's important to mention, my sister was definitely tipsy. She'd been drinking the entire morning (mimosas and an alcoholic punch our mom made). 

That said, when she tried to swat at me I blocked her on instinct which set her off balance. She stumbled a little then dramatically collapsed and started crying. I froze. 

My mom immediately bent down to soothe her and it took about 15 minutes and another glass of alcohol to coax her away from the dining room and back out to the yard. My mom laughed it off afterwards so I didn't think much of it. 

Later, I rejoined the group outside with a cup of coffee and everyone was giving me weird looks. Not staring or anything, but giving me weary glances the whole time. Eventually, my brother asked me to help him with something and then pulled me aside. 

He asked my why I pushed Cindy (my sister) and I was confused. He then told me Cindy had said we'd have an altercation in the kitchen where I had apparently shoved her into the counter and pushed her to the ground because I thought she didn't deserve an Easter basket. I was stunned. 

Apparently, she told everyone I had said she was undeserving of an Easter basket and shoved her. 

I clarified what happened and thought that would be the end of it. 

But when we finally sat down to eat, my mom tried to sit Cindy next to me and she made a huge stink about it, relaying the story that I had shoved her because of an Easter basket. I was annoyed by now so I clarified, probably louder than was necessary, what happened. 

She got incredibly upset and ending up storming out and leaving. Brunch was really awkward after that. 

When I left, I for a text from my mom asking Cindy and I to apologize to each other (this was in a group chat). Cindy refused to apologize unless I apologized first and it became a whole thing.

Now everyone at brunch is pretty divided, my brother being practically the only one on my side. 

So now I'm asking for some outside opinions. AITA here?

1k45gge,https://www.reddit.com/r/matrix/comments/1k45gge/i_read_the_script_for_the_matrix_resurrections_ama/,I Read the Script for the Matrix Resurrections: AMA,"How? Took a trip to LA to visit the Margaret Herrick Library where the script can be read via an iPad on sight. Spent five hours with the script taking notes on the more interesting details mostly related to material that didn‚Äôt make the final cut.

General Thoughts: It‚Äôs beautiful. The script was clearly written with love. There are portions that do not have the same meticulousness of the original. But there are no deleted scenes. The majority of changes between script and film look to have just come down to time and budget which is pretty much the same for the other three films. If you were hoping for some golden nugget to change your mind about the movie you will not find it in the script. But if you loved the movie you will find even more to appreciate about it after reading the script. Below are most of my notes while reading and moments I felt were important enough to share.

I did my best when copying portions of the script to do so exactly as written. Letter for letter, space for space, punctuation as placed. However I am only human and fatigue from having just gotten off a plane landing in LA that morning and heading straight to the library for five hours of research did take hold. I cannot claim everything written is 100% accurate to the document. But I stand by what I have and can at least say it was all taken from an official source.

Opening:

The program Trinity inside Thomas‚Äô modal is named ‚ÄúEcho‚Äù.

For the introduction of ‚ÄúAgent Smith/Morpheus‚Äù the script says

>‚ÄúEverything is as it once was; everything that is, except that Agent Smith is a black man.‚Äù

The script describes the modal playing out ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù opening as

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs similar but enhanced the way we exaggerate a story over time.‚Äù

When Seq and Bugs are on the roof discussing ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù being capture by Agents its the helicopter shining it‚Äôs search light on Bugs that breaks the connection Seq has.

The Anderson‚Äôs restaurant fall is scripted.

>Groping wildly she catches hold of an edge of a sign; ANDERSON‚ÄôS Restaurant. Neon bulbs shatter and spark as she slams against it, shearing down the letters, sliding until‚Äî

>Landing on the top of the horizontal tag line at the bottom of the sign: For Those Who Love to Eat Shit

Small change the script has Agent Jones glitching out after Bugs runs off:

>Bugs gets up; the police rush from the hotel blockage toward her; the nightmare grows more surreal as the broken, glitching Agent rises.

>Agent Jones: Kill‚Ä¶ Kill‚Ä¶

In the script ‚Äúdigital sentence‚Äù to describe Smith/Morpheus is something Bugs comes up with on the fly after a pause. In the film she doesn‚Äôt have to think up what to call him.

>Bugs: Do you understand that you are, how should I put this‚Ä¶ digital sentience?

When Bugs starts looking around Neo‚Äôs apartment the script names Thomas Anderson as working at ‚ÄúCortex‚Äù not ‚ÄúMetaCortex‚Äù. ‚ÄúCortex‚Äù was the original name for the company Anderson worked for in the first film but had to be changed to avoid potential copyright issues.

>sifting through the desk, the 1990s computer equipment, the pictures and articles she finds an ID from Cortex‚Äî

There was even more emotion written into Morpheus‚Äô realizing who he is and Bugs.

>Bugs: Who are you and what do you have to do?

>He‚Äôs afraid to say it out loud but knows this is his chance.

>Agent Smith: I‚Äôm Morpheus. And I have to find Neo.

>Now she is unable to breathe.

>Bugs: Morpheus...

>She wants to cry; she runs to him and throws her arms around him. No one has ever hugged him before.

Red pill awakenings had a bit more to them than just a drunk/high shaky cam effect. 

>The room pulses, lights dialing up, sparkling into fractals of code.

The transition from the end of the modal scene into Thomas‚Äô office has an Architect comparison/contrast:

>The windowpane explodes taking them to another world, shards of glass dissolve into code that melts into the darkness of‚Äî

>A COMPUTER MONITOR

>We pull back from the screen in a way that evokes the reveal of The Architect. There is a quiet alarm beeping.

>Man‚Äôs Voice: What the...

>The pull back reveals more screens. While The Architect‚Äôs screens exhibited a machined omniscient perfection‚Äî

>These screens of varying sizes, covered in Post-Its, running miscellaneous programs and social media feeds suggest something rather human as a man types in concentrated burst.
>Man‚Äôs Voice: What the hell‚Ä¶

There's a note in the script that names in reference to characters will change when the character actualizes who they are. So Morpheus is Smith until he wakes up. Thomas is Neo until he takes the pill etc.

Thomas surveying the modal is a bit different than it is in the film

>cutting between Thomas‚Äô office and the modal we see the carnage left of the modal.

>Thomas‚Äô objective survey becomes subjective as he sees himself actually standing outside the Heart of the City hotel.
>Thomas: What happened‚Ä¶
>In the modal apartment, he finds Agent Smith‚Äôs sunglasses.

>Back in his office, Thomas works so intently he doesn't notice his assistant BOBBI at his door

Jude has a small change made to his dialogue when he walks in asking what Thomas was up to.

>Thomas: A little modal experiment‚Ä¶

>Jude: For Binary? Ohh, Dude. Drooling emoji. Everyone is so pumped for this game. Is this what it felt like when you were working on The Trilogy?

Script description of Simulatte

>Hipster coffee ship for artists, philosophers and socialist pulling down high six figures.

I think it‚Äôs actually said in the film but in case you missed it the Simulatte barista is named ""Skroce"" after Steve Skroce in the script.

During Jude and Thomas talking about Tiffany, Jude is the one to bring up the comparison between Tiffany and Trinity.

>Jude: can I ask a question? Do you still think she looks like you-know-who?

>He doesnt have to answer.

>Jude: That is sooooo crazy‚Äî (Thomas shoots a look) And cool. So cool. I mean, beauty, it‚Äôs all about the eye of the beholder, right?

The two kids with Tiffany‚Äôs are named Donnie (younger) and Brandon (older). Brandon is the one who asks if Neo is trying to bone his mom.

Using Keanu‚Äôs stunt double was not just a clever cameo/easter egg it was intentional. Chad is described as:>A handsome man who could be Thomas‚Äô younger, fitter brother moves toward them.

Slight tweaks to the end of this scene.

>the family gathers and exits. As they leave, she glances back one last time. Jude touches Thomas‚Äô shoulder.
>Jude: Sorry. I didn‚Äôt know about handsome Chad. Really solid handshake.

>Thomas watches her go. 

>Jude: Another cortado?

Gwyn De Vere is the full name of the character Christina Ricci plays.

>Brainstorm womb at deus machina

>A hipster creative space: bean bags, swings and ping pong tables suggest ‚Äúoutside the box thinking.‚Äù

>The Creatives occupy the space like overfed cats. The Head of Marketing, GWYN DE VERE (female 40s) leads the meeting. Her assistant hands out a glossy thick report.
MONTAGE/WHITE RABBIT SCENE:

Scene is roughly seven pages. Here it is in its entirety as written in the script minus location and scene numbering. Just description and dialogue. Most of it is as filmed but there are enough small changes to dialogue and the ending with some details about the characters I thought it worth copying in full:

>We MONTAGE returning to the unending Brainstorm. Each day is a repetition with slight variations: clothes change, the weather, the pastries, the surface of things.
>ZEN and GJ prefer the title ‚ÄúConceptualizer‚Äô to Designer

>Zen: What made Matrix different? It effed with your head

>GJ: People want us up in their grey-space, switching their synaptic WTF light on.

>ASTRA is an adorkable nerd

>Astra: Since Matrix was released, our world has become more virtual and less real‚Äî

>Zen: Fake news is real‚Äî

>Fione: People need another wake up call.

>Thomas wakes again. Consumes more espresso. He stares out the window again at birds intersecting a plane‚Ä¶ Is it exactly the same as the other day?

>SCOTT is the room‚Äôs cynic who wears a different 80‚Äôs game t-shirt everyday

>Scott: I didn‚Äôt love the first ones like some of you and frankly I‚Äôve got zero tolerance for anything that requires a syllabus and a highlighter. I like my games Big, Loud and DUMB‚Äî

>Jude: We need guns! Lots of guns!

>Scott: Matrix means MAYHEM‚Äî

>In his apartment, Thomas is drinking, watching a kung fu movie for inspiration. He leaps up, throws a series of attacks, ending with a kick that throws him off-balance‚Äî

>He smashes into his coffee table. Ouch.

>Astra: Mindless action is not on-brand.

>Zen: She‚Äôs right. Matrix is Mind-porn. Philosophy in shiny, tight PVC

>GJ: Oh yeahhh‚Ä¶ Ideas are the new sexy

>BATHROOM CUBICLE, in which Thomas is taking a crap. At eye level on the door he is faced by the quote, ‚ÄòIT IS SO MUCH SIMPLER TO BURY REALITY THAN IT IS TO DISPOSE OF DREAMS‚Äô

>And under that, ‚ÄúPlease bury yourself.‚Äù And under that: ‚ÄúAnd compost your crap quotes.‚Äù

>Jude: Ideas are dangerous. People are afraid of ideas. I am.

>Astra: Have you read the threads from these RedPill asshats?

>She starts to read and burst into laughter while‚Äî

>Thomas stares into the folds of mirrors of his BATHROOM. Endless reflections; some seem out of sync, staring at him.

>He tips a pill onto his palm. Waits for his reflection to swallow it‚Ä¶

>FIONE one of their best coders, shares her opinion while in an ELEVATOR, Thomas stares at everyone on their phone.

>Fione: The problem is we‚Äôre already living in The Matrix. This is my RL‚Äî

>She wiggles her phone.

>Scott: But I want the Desert of the RL! I want the Statue of Liberty buried in black ice‚Äî You maniacs ‚ÄúYou blew it up!‚Äù

>Astra: Uhh, been there, like a billion times.

>Alarm again. GYM, on the treadmill. The young man beside Thomas increasing his speed.

>Thomas fights to keep up.

>Fione: We have to focus on the world building‚Äî

>Astra: The romance.

>Brainstormer: You mean the Bromance‚Äî

>Brainstormer 2: Don‚Äôt forget the Foemance!

>Thomas stops at his favorite NOODLE SHOP. Orders his usual ramen. The INDIAN GIRL at the cashier reading Alice in Wonderland, the Red Queen‚Äôs Race chapter. She smiles at him.

>Indian Girl: Same again?

>Jude has the floor. He winks at Thomas hiding in the back

>Jude: We are so down the wrong rabbit hole people. Allow me to sum up our goal as game designers with a single word: Bullet-time.

>Zen: That‚Äôs two word.

>Jude: Do not ‚Äòno‚Äô my flow. You say ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù to anyone, this is what they think‚Äî

>Jude makes explosive slow motion sounds as he mimes Neo dodging bullets. Thomas hears a FLASH of the real sound, glimpsing Neo until Jude crashes to the floor.

>Jude: We need a tech breakthrough! We gotta revolutionize gaming! Again. We need a new Bullet-time! Am I right, Tom?

>Tomas Anderson: Sure.

>Everyone turns to Thomas; he stares back in silence but we can hear him laughing‚Äî

>In his PENTHOUSE alone at night; he hits his vape; eats ice cream; gazes at his reflection in the large spoon while the voices continue to haunt him.

>Astra: This can‚Äôt be another Reboot, Retread, Regurgitate‚Äî

>Scott: Why not? Reboots sell.

>Back in the PENTHOUSE, comfortable numb, he digs into a beautiful steak; drinks expensive wine.

>GJ: Face reality people‚Äî Movies are dead. Games are dead. Narrative is dead.

>Zen: Media is nothing but Neural Trigger Responses and Viral Conditioning‚Äî

>Astra: What are you two talking about?

>Zen: Cat videos.

>GJ: What we need is a series of videos we call The Catrix.

>Night smears into day as he plays games giggles at people online; cries at dog videos

>Brainstorm Voices: Over the last 20 years The Matrix has become a cliche‚Äî No, it‚Äôs zeitgeist. It‚Äôs Metageist! What about The Matrix Reborn! Redeemed! Rebranded!

>Back in the NOODLE SHOP, Thomas quiets slurps Ramen, flipping through Tinder; behind him he does not notice TIFFANY getting take out. The Voices continue to argue‚Äî

>Brainstorming Voices: The Matrix is all about gender‚Äî It‚Äôs Trans-politics‚Äî A metaphor of Capitalist exploration‚Äî Crypto-Black Lives Matter! I want a third pill! A green pill! I want all the pills! Look around! The Matrix is everywhere. It‚Äôs everywhere‚Ä¶ its everywhere...

>Brainstormer Voice #2: This game is no where.

>The Argument goes nowhere until Marketing gently takes over.

>Gwyn: ...obviously our focus groups were a bit more decisive than the people in this room, over 93% choosing the top two boxes regarding titles that begin ‚ÄúR-E-‚Äú with ‚ÄúResurrection‚Äù as the clear favorite. So, given what we felt was a slam-dunk, Marketing took the liberty of generating some art to inspire you‚Äî

>Her handsome assistant unveils the poster: The Matrix: RESURRECTION. Neo is bigger, badder and louder than ever. Smith grins like the Grinch.

>Smith: Cha-ching. When I look at you all I see is dollar signs.

>Thomas looks ready to be sick‚Äî

Tiffany and Thomas's Second Meeting:

Tiffany talks about her bike and deals with her life. Scene plays during her and Neo‚Äôs second meeting in the cafe.

>Tiffany: Whenever I feel like I can‚Äôt do another load of laundry or deal with the goddamn bills, I get up before everyone else, while it‚Äôs still and dark.. I find some empty highway and let her run free.

>Tiffany: Sometimes I think those rides are the only thing keeping me sane.

The ending of their meeting has some small changes with Neo seeing Tiffany‚Äôs fake DSI along with his.

>Tiffany: I gotta go. I hope, I see you again.

>She rushes off; in the mirror near the door, Thomas glimpses a reflection that doesn‚Äôt seem to be her.

DEM GAMES ATTACK

>Thomas is back at his desk; he stares into the black mirror of a monitor. On one of the other black monitors we see a reflection that doesn‚Äôt seem to be his.

Agent cameo during the Deus Machina ‚ÄúSwatting‚Äù

>Thomas steps into the flow of people heading through the maze of cubicles toward the elevator. He has an intense deja vu, recalling the scene where Neo was first arrested.

>An Agent leads a group of cops straight towards him. He has the instinct to hide or flee but-

>The group passes him as if he wasn‚Äôt there. Suddenly his phone vibrates.

NEO TAKES THE REDPILL:

I did not take notes for all of them but there are several flashcuts from the trilogy all over this first act. Pretty much any time you saw something and thought ‚ÄúI remember that‚Äù the script was calling for a quick splice of exactly what you remember to be inserted into the scene. Several of these are in the movie but several were also cut out. Here‚Äôs an interesting twist on that approach while Neo‚Äôs memories start to become distorted.

>A mist of fog halos the lights. Thomas is self medicating with vodka. Its not helping him untangle his realities.

>The Analyst‚Äô voice echos imploringly, ‚Äúwe don't want anyone to get hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù as Thomas feels a FLASHCUT of Trinity dying.

>He takes a huge swig of vodka

>Memories continue to smear; he meets Trinity in the club, ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù But she answers, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Tiffany.‚Äù

>He drinks again, then looks over the parapet. He sees himself falling, Trinity falling, their ship falling. His phone rings. He sees it‚Äôs Jude; sends it voicemail

Golden light shows up after Thomas takes the redpill.

>The tips of Neo‚Äôs fingers glow with golden light. As he moves them, they leave residual trails with sparkles of code.

>His head wobbles with a lightness; flutters rise from his stomach. The world dissolves into Code, as the golden energy of his True Self emerges‚Äî

>The reflection of a BALDING NERD dissolves into Neo.

>He reaches to the mirror as he once did. His fingers dip into the liquid mirror, disappearing beneath its surface.

>Neo: ..here we go‚Ä¶ again.

THEATER/TRAIN ATTACK:

Neo tries to stop bullets on the bullet train

>Neo feels the pill intensely; the world is smeared by a viscous gelatin of time, windows streak into streams of shimmering code‚Äî

>The SWAT forces from the theater crash into the train, targeting Neo as he stands, lifting his hand‚Äî

>Neo: No‚Ä¶

>They fire; the bullets do not stop, shredding everything, punching a hole through Neo‚Äôs palm‚Äî

>He screams and collapses as‚Äî

>FLASH CUT to the ANOMALEUM where a thumping pulse wracks a body as though shocked with a defibrillator, while microbots swarm around a hand‚Äî

>Back on the TRAIN, Bugs carries Neo behind chairs; Morpheus and the crew fire, covering them. She bandages his hand.

During the fight this wound becomes important.

>Lexy and Berg keep returning fire outside. Neo‚Äôs wound is smeared syrup. He peels back the cloth around his hand.

And finally when he‚Äôs facing the mirror to escape.

>Code is visible through the wound. IT widens, exposing more code, spreading until Thomas stares through a perfect hand-shaped window into a universe of code‚Äî

>Bugs grabs his hand. It is completely healed.

>Charted by proof of her beliefs, she pushes Neo to the sink.

>Bugs: Ok. In you go!

>Morpheus assists. Together they shove Neo to the mirror. He thrusts his arm into the liquid mirror which stretches into the caul of the Anomaleum Pod‚Äî

>Yanking his arm back, he faces his reflection, a moment of truth paralyzing him with doubt: Why am I doing this?

>Neo:‚Ä¶because I choose to?

>He grits his teeth and plunges his face into the liquid reflection, uniting his mind with‚Äî

WELCOME BACK TO THE REAL WORLD:

Black sky confirmed to be made up of nanobots in the script:

>The bottom disappears into mists. Above them is the churning sludge of nano-stratus clouds.

ON THE MNEMOSYNE:

Quick mention of the Analyst cut out during Bugs and Neo‚Äôs first talk.

>Bugs: while it mines our bodies. Where better to bury the truth than inside something as ordinary as a video game.

>Neo:...it worked. He had me so convinced I was crazy‚Ä¶

>Bugs: Who?

>Neo: My‚Ä¶ Doctor.

>Bugs: The surround you with programs to control you.

Seq was the first one to believe Bugs when she started telling people she had seen Neo.

>Bugs: Seq was the first one to believe me when I told him I saw you‚Äî

>Seq: Not really, I thought she was crazy, but I wanted to.

One three occasions Seq offers to download programs for Neo to catch up on whats changed. One that was cut was a language program to understand Synths.

Hanno (Mnemosyne‚Äôs pilot) gets some backstory written in the script.

>Hanno a natural-born who lived through the Siege of Zion, communicates while on approach.

>Hanno: This is the Mnemosyne requesting clearance‚Äî

>IO Dock Contorl #1: Hanno! People are losing their shit! Did you really find him‚Äî

>Bugs clears her throat, leading Neo into the cockpit

>Hanno: That is a negative, Control. Another false alarm.

>There is an awkward tension; Neo understand he was no supposed to hear this exchange.

I‚àÖ:

Io isn't spelt I-O in the script. It‚Äôs spelt I-‚àÖ which has an entirely  different pronunciation from ""eye-oh"" as said in the film. Which is probably why when you watch the film and Bugs says ‚ÄúWelcome to Io‚Äù to Neo on their first arrival in the city her mouth looks like she‚Äôs saying something else and the line was dubbed over.

In the script the line and city are written as

>Bugs: Welcome to I‚àÖ

I will just use ‚ÄúIo‚Äù however. Speaking of we have some details about Io in the script.

>Io is a diagonal city of 100,000, built along the walls of an underground fjord; algae terraces cling to its contours; farms and bio-domes with glo-orbs; unfinished buildings with machine-tech skeleton framing.

>Overhead is a glowing band of sky-blue, a hundred meters in width, that follows to fjord. Neo stares up at it in awe.

Neo‚Äôs arrival in Io isn‚Äôt without it‚Äôs problems

>A cargo elevator opens; Bugs, Neo and the crew are escorted by an armed detail. The soldiers stay tight, covering them.

>The passage is dark but Neo can feel scores of people behind the grating and pipes. He sees fingers and hands reaching, desperate eyes, while voices whisper‚Äî

>Io Voices: Is it him? Is it you? Is it really The One?
Shepherd is Niobe‚Äôs second in command. This is pretty obvious in the movie but spelt out in the script.

Niobe and Neo‚Äôs conversation has some small changes. In the script the power scarcity is caused by something called ‚Äúpod-rot‚Äù. No details on what this is but it was not just too many people being freed.

>Niobe: During the Peace, when I walked around, I saw people dancing and smiling‚Ä¶ for no reason. Those years were some of the best of my life and I remember thinking, whatever we‚Äôve done, whatever sacrifices we‚Äôd made for peace‚Ä¶ it was all worth it.

>Neo: What went wrong?

>Niobe: It started as whispers. There were problems in the Machine cities. Pod-rot was spreading everywhere, causing shortages. Power plants were unable to produce enough energy. Nothing can breed violence like scarcity.

There‚Äôs also a bit more about Niobe and Morpheus when she talks about him.

>Niobe: After the Siege, he was elected unanimously to High Chair of the Council. Ohhh how he loved that. And the people loved him. But as rumors of this new power spread, he ignored them. He was certain what you had done, couldn‚Äôt be undone. But the world changes. Never how we expect, never how we want it to. I argued with him. I screamed, begged. He wouldn‚Äôt listen. None of them would. All these people never stopped believing in miracles‚Ä¶ believing in you.

Niobe and Freya are very much couple. As Niobe is watching the Bugs fly off and she makes a comment about how she should shoot them out of the sky

>Niobe half-turns around: Freya walks over, deshabille in a big cozy blanket.

>Freya: I love my gruff General

>Niobe: Freya: I aint‚Äô playin‚Äô.

>Freya: Come on, Be‚Ä¶ How long have we been together? I know how much you hated locking him up just like I know, a part of you is relieved watching him go.

EXILE FIGHT:

Smith and Neo's conversation is identical with just a few changes between script and film. However this part was cut.

>Smith: Can you believe he had me, me, eating a four color dinner, brushing my teeth‚Äî gotta-get my eight hours‚Äî convinced I was human? Like the very definition of cruel and unusual punishment.

>Neo: Maybe just karma.

>Smith: Ohhh, Does that mean you got the life you deserved? Back in your pod, churning out energy for your masters again?
The fight starts completely differently.

>Smith: We agree it‚Äôs better you die than let the Analyst control you again.

>He throws a pile-driver of a punch that Neo mirrors as in Revolutions. The explosion sends them both flying back as‚Äî

>Mayhem ensues

Small note, one of the exiles was going to have a flamethrower. Just thought that was cool.

Here‚Äôs what the Merv is screaming at everyone whole they fight.

>Merovingian: You‚Ä¶ YOU ruined everything! Everything was better before you! Everysuckmysilkyassthing! We had grace! Style! We had conversations! Not this‚Äî <mimics texting> We went out to dinner! Not Couchflixeatmycoldfires! We had ACTUAL sex! OhPersephonepoodle- princessImissyou. Art, film, books were all better! ORIGINALITY MATTERED! YOU ruined all of it! You gave us FaceZuckersuck and Instapop iSpyTubeholeViralClimateSextingPanopitCockmeWikiPissShit!!!

Close to what was filmed minus the comment about sex and Persephone.

The fight is not detailed in the script. The major beats for everyone is about all that's said in the script. Wether that's Bugs and crew dealing with the exiles and Smith and Neo's fight below.

Agent Johnson is in the script. Here is the entirely of that from first mention to last.

>Bugs is battered into a corner. She has no hope until Seq rushes Lexy and Berg to her aide.

>Agent Johnson: I know you.

>Morpheus battles the exiled Agent Johnson, burning for revenge. The crew barely defeats the final Exiles. Lexy and Berg shoot Agent Johnson.

>Morpheus: Thank you.

>Above them, The Merovingian rages.

>Merovingian: I spit on you! <French Cruses> I will be back! I will Reboot! I will sequelfranchisespinoff! This is not over! <French cursing> I wipe my ass in your general direction!

Neo and Tiffany Meeting:

When Neo has his next meeting with Tiffany that the Analyst interrupts there‚Äôs a cut moment where Seq spots that Kush isn‚Äôt what he appears to be.

>Seq hacks the scene. Bugs watches from outside.

>Seq: Captain, the guy in the garage is not reading clean‚Äî

>Bugs: A bot?

>Kush opens a drawer, revealing a gun with a silencer. His eyes shimmer with green code.

The ‚Äúbullet time‚Äù exposition also was a bit different with the Analyst transforming into Jude.

>The Analyst: You gave me the idea‚Äî

>The Analyst becomes Jude

>Jude/Analyst: Hey Dude. Allow me sum up our goal in a single word: Bullet-time‚Äî

>He mimes Bullet-Time while Neo is trapped by Bullet-time.

>Jude/Analyst: Ha! Kinda ironic using the power that defined you, to control you///

>Grabbing Tiffany‚Äôs welding torch, he blasts sparks out that hang in the air; willow tree fronds made of light.

>Jude/Analyst: Bro‚Ä¶ relativity is sooooo cool.

>Dropping the Jude mask, he grins.

There‚Äôs also a good bit of exposition cut down for time with some fun lore details. Such as the new Matrix having a 100% acceptance rate.

>Analyst: Let‚Äôs just say, bad things happened. However, as long as I managed to keep you close‚Äî but not too close‚Äî I discovered something incredible‚Ä¶

>Cables are wired to other humans laid out in the laboratory.

>Analysts: Anyone plugged into the same sim accepted the program‚Äî unconditionally.

Bit more commentary on the Architect from the Analyst.

>Analyst: Now.. my predecessor loved precision. His Matrix was all fussy facts and equations. He hated the human mind so he never bothered to understand that you don‚Äôt give a shit about facts; it‚Äôs all about fiction. Reality is entirely subjective.

And an earlier mention of the ‚ÄúSuits‚Äù

>Analyst: I explained it to the Suits like this: think of The Matrix as a pyramid. The original was built for the Sheeple from which the anomaly, that‚Äôs you, emerged at the top. Mine is inverted; the anomaly is the base, the point on which the whole system depends.

>Analyst: You understand? This world was literally built for you. I‚Äôm telling you all of this because I want you to come back, back where you belong.

And there‚Äôs a bit of context to establish that this entire scene happens in a single moment. After the Analyst disappears we get this.

>Seq blinks and the gun is gone.
Implying that from the moment Seq saw the gun in Kush‚Äôs hand it immediately disappeared and only Neo and the Analyst experienced any of their conversation. Explains why Bug‚Äôs crew doesn‚Äôt immediately jump in to help Neo.

NEO, NIOBE, SATI CONVERSATION

Sait gives a bit more detail on why she hid Neo and Trinity from Niobe
>Sati: There were times I doubted my decision, but Io needed you. This city had to be built for your people as well as mine. If I‚Äôd told you everything, you would have had to make a very difficult choice. I sought to protect you, and saw no purpose in forcing the situation before either Neo or Trinity was ready to be free.

Sati also gives more details about how the new Matrix is constructed building off what the Analyst told Neo.

>Sati: In the original Matrix, the anomaly was a derivative of the Source-Code. In this version, you and Trinity *are* the Source-Code.

>Sati: If you were both to escape and return as free minds‚Ä¶ I believe it could ensure peace and the future of this city.

>Niobe: Okay. I‚Äôm listening‚Ä¶

>Sati: The Analyst was incautious but he‚Äôs not stupid. Since Neo‚Äôs escape, security has been severely tightened. Getting Trinity out, will require nothing less than a miracle, which is why I need to know one thing: after all these years Neo, are you certain Trinity wants to be free

NIOBE RALLIES THE TROOPS:

Another moment between Niobe of Freya after she sends out Io‚Äôs crews to help Neo.

>Niobe: Thank you‚Ä¶ knuckle up and good luck

>She touches fists with all of them as they leave. Freya steps out of the shadows.

>Freya: It never gets easy, does it?

>Niobe: Sending good people to die? ‚Ä¶no.

>Freya puts her arms around her as Niobe‚Äôs eyes melt to tears.

SIMULATTE SHOWDOWN:

Tiffany never finished playing the Matrix.

>Tiffany: After you left... I went home... I played it... The Matrix... I kept thinking, why does this story... feel like a memory?

>She doesn't‚Äô want him to answer that question.

>Tiffany: I stopped playing when I realized they were going to die‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt watch that‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt.

>Neo understands

>Neo: I know.

Sati earlier mentions that Trinity does not have to take a redpill to wake up but doing so will help the process. Trinity never does in the film but in the script the pill gets some attention.

>Neo: Afraid of losing the only person I ever loved.

>Tiffany: I wish I was who you think I am‚Ä¶ But look at me‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt be her‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt be.. I can barely make a yoga class. I‚Äôm nobody.

>Neo: They make you feel that way. Right now, they are injecting your mind with chemicals to increase your fear and sense of isolation. They did it to me too.

>Tiffany: Who are ‚Äòthey‚Äô?

>He pulls out a red pill and sets it down between them.

>Neo: You know who.

>A powerful memory stirs inside her. The pill sits between them like an engagement ring, or cyanide.

>Tiffany: Oh God.

Her kids then show up to interrupt the moment.

>Tiffany: What? Oh no‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt fair‚Ä¶

>Neo: No it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ they took the life we were never able to have and used it to control us.

Tiffany has the same reawakening that Neo‚Äôs did.

>Trinity: I hate that name

>Her Matrix code flares as her Semblance disintegrates and the gold energy of her True Self is released.

>Trinity: My name is Trinity. And you better take your hands off me.

Tiffany‚Äôs kids were involved in the cafe fight.

>Neo fights to get to Trinity but is beset by SWAT behemoths. Trinity surges toward him but her teenager seizes her arm.

>Donnie: Mom!

>He looks sad and helpless. The younger kid grabs her leg.>Brandon: Mommy! We need you.

>Trinity: Let go of me.

>Seq understands what they are before anyone else.

>Seq: Those kids‚Äî they‚Äôre not kids‚Äî

>Lexy: What?

>Trinity tries to slip free but they grow more aggressive, attacking as they shift into a green-eyed demons.

>Brandon: Bitch!

>The youngest snarls with shark teeth‚Äî

>Donnie: Bad mommy!

>He chomps her leg; he kicks him even as the other attacks, lunging at her throat.

Neo and Smith have a brief team-up moment in the fight.

>Agents attack Smith defending The Analyst, all of them bullet dodging at high speed. Neo smashes through the surrounding SWAT and for a moment he fights back to back with Smith

>Smith: Who‚Äôd have guessed‚Äî

>Neo: Us on the same side?

>Smith: I wouldn‚Äôt get used to it.

>Neo: No.

Lana wrote in a Talladega Nights reference in the script.

>Trinity fights to be free of her monster children. She sees Neo and their eyes lock on one another and they know the only way out of this hell is together‚Äî-

>Trinity: Neo, give me that goddamn pill‚Äî

>He throws it to her. A spider monkey leaps, snatching it from her. But she hooks him before he can swallow it.

>Trinity: Give that to me.

>Donnie: Eat shit!

>With a quick pop of her knee, the pill flies up; she grabs and swallows it‚Äî

We get a few more details about what it was like for Bugs to be rewired in Trinity‚Äôs place after Trinity is freed.

>Bugs feels the Anomaleum sucking all of the life out of her. The huge machine bellows until the Synthients manage to yank the plug free from Bugs who crumbles.

>Bugs: What the hell was that?

>Sati: The weight of the world‚Ä¶

>Morpheus: Are you alright?

>The roar of the turbines grinds to a stop. For a moment there is only the sound of Bugs panting. Then, a scream of metal chased by a rushing wind.

>Sati: We have to go.

>The Sentinels come rushing into the Anomaleum from every direction, but all they find is a few exomorphic balls rattling gently in the bottom of Neo‚Äôs pod.

Small tweak to this line. In the film Smith calls Neo ‚ÄúTom‚Äù in the script he calls him ‚ÄúMr. Anderson‚Äù.

>Smith: Well, I‚Äôll take that as my cue. Here our unexpected alliance ends.

>He smiles.> Smith: You know the difference between us, Mr. Anderson? Anyone could have been you‚Ä¶ whereas I‚Äôve always been anyone.

One of the other captains in the cafe is named Calliope. She‚Äôs only mentioned once and that‚Äôs it.

BIKE CHASE:

During the Bike trace the pill was having an effect on Trinity but she‚Äôs enough of a badass to push through it.

>The pill slows and speeds time, smearing the chase, yet Trinity drives like herself. The world shimmers with code as she cuts through swarm with the power of a shark‚Äî

LEAP OF FAITH:

On the top of the skyscraper we get more description of whats happening around Neo and Trinity as they reconnect.

>They are alone for a precious moment. The code swirls around them in fractals; she touches his face; his heart glows gold the same as hers while‚Äî

>The story of their love flashes back to her

>Trinity: I remember‚Ä¶ this‚Ä¶ us‚Ä¶

There was a cut to the ship when Trinity begins to fly where the crew asks all the questions we did.

>Neo: Wha‚Äî I‚Äôm not doing this? Are you doing this?

>It feels curiously natural to her; flying

>Seq: Does that mean‚Äî

>Lexy: Is she‚Äî

>Berg: Are they‚Äî

>The helicopter leaves with them; the pilot stares in shock and awe.

FREE AT LAST:

Neo and Trinity‚Äôs first moment on the ship is beautiful. No changes from film just wanted to share it from the script.

>Neo reaches for her, she reaches back. Their fingers touch in a way for the first time. Then their heads. And finally lips.

>This moment is the most real thing either has known in a very long time. It is home.

ANALYST HOME:

Trinity‚Äôs description flying into the Analyst house.

>Trinity floats into the building. She is as we remember, in shiny patent armor and sunglasses.

Neo‚Äôs description.

>Neo walks into the destroyed building; in his cassock the hero we remember.

The conversation between Trinity, Neo, and the Analyst is identical to film. The only line cut was this.

>Analyst: Can‚Äôt you control her?

>Neo: You had it easy with me. All I wanted was peace.

I wasn‚Äôt able to transcribe everything I‚Äôd have liked but I did read the script in full. If you have any questions about these notes or the script itself do not hesitate to ask.",5,1745211137.0,matrix,2,1.0,False
1k45gfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1k45gfc/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",1,1745211134.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False
1k45g7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1k45g7z/aita_for_not_getting_my_sister_an_easter_basket/,AITA for not getting my sister an Easter basket?,"I (19F) just got back from an Easter get together with my family and need some outside opinions on this situation.

This morning I went to brunch at my parents house for Easter. It was a relatively small get together, with only my parents, siblings and a couple cousins who were in the area. I think maybe 12 people total including kids.

Due to the majority of us being adults, there was a decent amount of alcohol being passed around. I feel the need to mention this for later.

A little before brunch, my mom surprised me, my brother and my sister (26F) with Easter baskets for us both. It wasn't anything fancy, just some chocolate and socks but I loved it anyways.

I thanked my mom and I mentioned it was funny she thought to do this because I did something similar for my fianc√© that morning (he was not at the brunch because of his job). While we were talking my sister came in to refill her drink and heard us talking and decided to jump into the conversation. 

She asked if I'd made her a basket too. At first I thought she was joking but when I tried to laugh it off she got upset with me. (For context, we haven't been on the best terms for a while now, but I'm not getting into that). 

She started poking fun at me, calling me lazy and forgetful and a bad sister. I was got upset and my mom tried to mediate by offering my sister another drink, but my sister pushed passed her and tried to swat at my face. 

Now I think it's important to mention, my sister was definitely tipsy. She'd been drinking the entire morning (mimosas and an alcoholic punch our mom made). 

That said, when she tried to swat at me I blocked her on instinct which set her off balance. She stumbled a little then dramatically collapsed and started crying. I froze. 

My mom immediately bent down to soothe her and it took about 15 minutes and another glass of alcohol to coax her away from the dining room and back out to the yard. My mom laughed it off afterwards so I didn't think much of it. 

Later, I rejoined the group outside with a cup of coffee and everyone was giving me weird looks. Not staring or anything, but giving me weary glances the whole time. Eventually, my brother asked me to help him with something and then pulled me aside. 

He asked my why I pushed Cindy (my sister) and I was confused. He then told me Cindy had said we'd have an altercation in the kitchen where I had apparently shoved her into the counter and pushed her to the ground because I thought she didn't deserve an Easter basket. I was stunned. 

Apparently, she told everyone I had said she was undeserving of an Easter basket and shoved her. 

I clarified what happened and thought that would be the end of it. 

But when we finally sat down to eat, my mom tried to sit Cindy next to me and she made a huge stink about it, relaying the story that I had shoved her because of an Easter basket. I was annoyed by now so I clarified, probably louder than was necessary, what happened. 

She got incredibly upset and ending up storming out and leaving. Brunch was really awkward after that. 

When I left, I got a text from my mom asking Cindy and I to apologize to each other (this was in a group chat). Cindy refused to apologize unless I apologized first and it became a whole thing.

Now everyone at brunch is pretty divided, my brother being practically the only one on my side. 

So now I'm asking for some outside opinions. AITA here?

1k45fxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepeater/comments/1k45fxz/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point.

Like a lot of people out there, I‚Äôve dealt with sleep issues most of my adult life. Some nights I just can‚Äôt fall asleep no matter how tired I feel, and other nights I wake up multiple times and can‚Äôt get back to sleep. I‚Äôve tried everything from melatonin pills to calming teas, audiobooks, and blackout curtains. Some helped a little, but nothing really fixed the problem.

A friend told me about something called the **Wellamoon sleeping patch**. I had never heard of sleep patches before. I was skeptical, especially since the idea of absorbing sleep ingredients through my skin felt kind of odd. Still, I figured it was worth a try.

This is a full rundown of my experience using the **Wellamoon sleep patch** for a full 30 days.

# What Is the Wellamoon Sleep Patch?

The **Wellamoon sleep patch** is a small, thin patch that you apply to your skin before bed. It works by slowly releasing sleep-supporting ingredients through your skin overnight. Unlike melatonin pills or sleep supplements that you swallow, these patches use a **transdermal delivery system**.

Each **Wellamoon patch** contains:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** to help regulate your natural sleep cycle
* **Valerian Root (27mg)**, a calming herb used for stress and sleep support
* **Hops (16.53mg)**, known to help with relaxation and deeper sleep
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)**, which helps calm the nervous system and relax muscles

The concept is that these ingredients seep into your system more gradually, which could lead to more restful and uninterrupted sleep.

If you want to check out the full details, I found it here: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Week One: Getting Started

The first time I used a **Wellamoon sleeping patch**, I applied it to my upper arm about 45 minutes before bed. You‚Äôre supposed to place it on a clean, hairless area like the forearm, shoulder, or thigh. It stuck well and didn‚Äôt bother me at all while I slept.

I didn‚Äôt feel any dramatic difference on night one, but I did notice that I fell asleep a little faster than usual. The real difference came on night three. I slept a solid six hours without waking up, which is rare for me. That alone had me curious enough to keep using it.

By the end of the week, I noticed I was falling asleep more easily and waking up fewer times.

# Weeks Two and Three: Noticing Changes

During the second week, I started to feel a more consistent rhythm. I was falling asleep within 20 to 30 minutes and waking up much later than I normally would. On some nights, I didn‚Äôt wake up at all. That was a big change.

My mornings also started feeling different. I usually wake up foggy and reach for coffee right away. But I noticed that I didn‚Äôt feel that same fog anymore. I still drank coffee out of habit, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed it just to feel normal.

By week three, I realized that I was starting to **wake up around the same time every morning**, without an alarm. It felt like my sleep schedule was getting back on track.

# Week Four: Final Impressions

By the fourth week, the **Wellamoon sleep patches** were part of my routine. I didn‚Äôt use them every single night by that point, but I did use them on nights when I felt like I might have trouble falling asleep. The great thing is that even on nights I didn‚Äôt use a patch, I still slept better than I had before starting.

What stood out most:

* **The patches are easy to use** and comfortable to wear
* **Sleep felt more natural**, not forced like with sleeping pills
* **No groggy mornings**, which is what always bothered me with oral melatonin

# So, Does the Wellamoon Sleeping Patch Actually Work?

In my case, it helped more than I expected. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs a real tool that improved my sleep quality without the side effects I‚Äôve had from pills or gummies. I also liked that **Wellamoon sleep patches** use natural, non-habit-forming ingredients and don‚Äôt mess with my morning routine.

They won‚Äôt work the same for everyone, but if you're dealing with **light to moderate sleep struggles**, I think they‚Äôre worth trying.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else here has used the **Wellamoon sleeping patch**. Did it work for you? Did you notice a difference compared to melatonin pills or other sleep aids?",1,1745210855.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

Should I reach out again ?,"I (32f) am infatuated with my former supervisor (35M). We had a chemistry while I was working at the company and at one point we almost kissed. We exchanged eye contact for a long period of time and then he leaned in to kiss me. The moment was my every fantasy that I had envisioned for months!!!! But, I felt really insecure at the time because it was at the end of a long shift and everything caught me so off guard. I basically stopped the kiss from happening when I started to cry (I am very inexperienced with kissing men and I felt so helpless) causing him to immediately pull back. We were okay after that and neither of us brought up the incident. We even exchanged numbers before I left the company. 

After my contract ended, I had to leave but kept thinking about him for months over and over. Not sure if this matters to the story: That office was a very strange experience for me‚ÄîI was pursued a lot in general which took me off guard. I am very inexperienced with men (I‚Äôm not super na√Øve though) having mostly worked in isolation as a researcher till now. 

Eventually I decided to call him and just confessed all the feelings I had without trying to overwhelm him. I mentioned how I loved his masculine energy and his compassion and that I missed him. I was nervous so I came off more direct than I anticipated. Overall, he seemed like he had already moved on initially but also seemed kind of interested (he seemed touched by what I was saying, was going along with my flirtations, offered to meet for coffee). He said he needed to think about it since he didn‚Äôt want this to interfere with his reputation at the company. I really felt like he wanted to meet and he even offered to meet for coffee. In my mind I was thrilled about it and waited a couple of days to hear back from him. Eventually, I got a text from him saying that he thinks it would be in both of our best interests not to meet up. 

We had a short call after that and I was too flustered to get the true closure I needed. I ended up asking him if this would affect his being my reference for a future employer. The call ended when I said I didn‚Äôt want to take up too much of his time. Now I feel lost. I know this sounds strange but in that final call, he seemed open to ‚Äúnegotiation‚Äù and as if he wanted to keep talking and I keep wondering if I should have explored his hesitations more. Of course I am not trying to push his boundaries, but that last call did not go well and I would at least like to meet up to talk in person. 

Either way I am 100% sure he was interested in me at work, we made eye contact VERY frequently and our conversations were long. Whenever we all were in group meetings he would sit right next to me. He opened up to me about a lot and as I was leaving he gave me his most cherished book from his collection. My thoughts are that he is worried I would tell anyone if we did get together because in our line of work it can be seen by some as unethical and he is very ambitious trying to get promoted to the higher corporate positions. His work means a great deal to him. 

At the same time, I know for a fact we have a great chemistry and that he is missing out on an amazing time. Should I reach out one last time? Would it seem very desperate? Is there anything I am missing",5,1745210725.0,AskMenAdvice,16,0.78,False

Not that I planned to vanish‚Äîmore like I needed space, and maybe a little breathing room from the world that never quite knew what to make of a guy like me. The place is all cracked wood, creaking floors, and a constant sense that the walls have seen more than they let on. There‚Äôs a windmill out back that spins even when there‚Äôs no wind. The previous owner left a note that simply read: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feed the corn.‚Äù

Every morning, the sun rises somewhere around the north. Sometimes it‚Äôs green. I‚Äôve stopped questioning it.

My closest neighbor lives just across the field, though calling it that feels wrong. The grass between us glows faintly at night, and once I swear I saw it blink. Her house is low and made of dark stone. It looks like it‚Äôs always been there, maybe before the town even had a name.
She‚Äôs Japanese, with skin the color of polished obsidian, as if her body absorbed starlight until it turned solid. I‚Äôve only seen her a few times‚Äîonce on her porch, sipping something from a bone-white cup, and another time walking barefoot through the fog at dawn. Her hair is always tied back in intricate coils, and when she glances my way, I forget what I was doing, or that I had anything to do at all. I don‚Äôt know her name. I haven‚Äôt been brave enough to ask.
The other residents don‚Äôt talk about her. Or maybe they do, but the words vanish from the air before they reach me.

Yesterday, the radio told me that a new species of flower has bloomed in town‚Äîa carnivorous tulip with a thirst for old regrets. Carlos says it‚Äôs probably fine. I‚Äôm trying to believe him.

But for now, I just sit on my porch, coffee in hand, watching the glowing field between us, and thinking that maybe, just maybe, tomorrow I‚Äôll wave.
Or maybe I‚Äôll feed the corn.


This morning I woke to the sound of bells.
Not wind chimes. Not the town's occasional ""unscheduled civic tolling."" No, these were deeper‚Äîancient sounding‚Äîand coming from inside the walls. I pressed my ear against the living room plaster and heard them again: a distant, resonant chime that rang every few seconds, like time itself was marking my heartbeat.

I made coffee anyway. I‚Äôve learned not to ignore weirdness here, but also not to encourage it. It‚Äôs a balance.

The field between my farmhouse and hers was thick with fog again, the kind that doesn‚Äôt drift or move. It just sits, like it‚Äôs waiting. I could barely make out her shape‚Äîstanding still, facing my house, wearing a pale robe that caught the faintest slivers of light. I stood behind the screen door, mug in hand, and watched her for a long while.

She didn‚Äôt wave. She didn‚Äôt move. She just stood there.

Eventually, she turned and walked back to her house. I didn‚Äôt realize I was holding my breath until she disappeared into the mist.

Later, I found something by my porch. A single origami crane, folded from black paper with silver threads running through it like veins. It was weighted enough not to blow away. I crouched, picked it up, and found nothing beneath it‚Äîno note, no symbols, just the crane. I kept it.

At the grocery co-op in town, they were out of everything I needed except radishes and unmarked cans that throb slightly if you hold them too long. I took a few, just in case.

The woman at the checkout line had a strange look in her eyes. She scanned each can without blinking and didn‚Äôt speak. When I thanked her, she just tilted her head, as though trying to hear something I couldn‚Äôt.
I left without pushing it.

Back home, the bells had stopped. The walls were silent. But the crane on my nightstand had moved three inches to the left.

I didn‚Äôt move it.

And I think tonight, I might light a lantern and sit on the porch again. Just in case she comes back.

Or just in case something else does.

The next week we both end up meeting at the monthly Town Fair‚Ä¶

Downtown Night Vale had a way of never quite looking the same twice. As our truck rolled down the main road, the sun dipped low behind the lavender-hued mountains, casting an unnatural golden glow over the buildings. The streetlamps hadn‚Äôt flickered on yet, and the long shadows made everything feel stretched, surreal‚Äîlike we were driving straight into a painting someone else was still working on.

Aya sat beside me, her shirt and bow tie combo she wore made her look confident, composed‚Äîlike a noir detective who had stepped straight out of another time and place.

As we pulled up near the Town Square, the first sounds of the Town Fair of the Unusual and Strange drifted through the open windows‚Äîsome sort of off-tempo calliope music, faint chanting, and the occasional goat bleating rhythmically, almost as if it was part of a band. 

I parked near a vendor cart labeled ‚ÄúSOUL POPS: Lick One, Feel Everything.‚Äù We got out, locking the truck behind us.

The Town Fair of the Unusual and Strange was already in full swing. Strings of flickering multicolored lights zigzagged overhead like tangled constellations. 

Booths lined the street‚Äîone claimed to read past lives using scented smoke, another sold ‚Äúauthentic pre-blessed crow feathers,‚Äù and a tall, eyeless man was juggling pineapples that screamed when they hit the air.

Aya leaned close and whispered, ‚ÄúDo not let me buy anything from that booth over there,‚Äù nodding toward a small, shadowy tent where a child-sized mannequin wearing a priest‚Äôs collar was preaching to a stack of potatoes.
‚ÄúNo promises,‚Äù I muttered, and she actually laughed. It was nice, hearing that.

We strolled side by side down the street, blending in with the crowd of townsfolk and... not-townsfolk. A man with half a face waved hello, and a floating golden cube offered us a sample of its ‚Äúmultiverse honey,‚Äù which Aya politely declined. 

I watched her eyes flicking across the booths, the alleys, the people‚Äîsubtle, calm, alert. She hadn‚Äôt let her guard down, even dressed like the world‚Äôs most adorable art history professor.

We passed a booth run by the Night Vale PTA selling eldritch-themed cupcakes and another where a psychic goldfish made predictions by swimming toward pictures of scenes from your future. Aya paused there, curious. The goldfish circled her image for a while before darting straight toward a blurry drawing of a bird made of television static. Neither of us said anything.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how it looked at me,‚Äù she finally said, and we moved on.

Behind us, someone whispered my name. Just once. I turned fast, scanning‚Äîbut there was no one there.

Aya noticed the shift in my stance and asked softly, ‚ÄúSomething?‚Äù
‚ÄúNot sure. Could be nothing,‚Äù I muttered, but we both knew better than to believe that.

We kept moving, past a booth offering ‚ÄúTemporary Extra Limbs ‚Äì Great for Dancing!‚Äù and toward the central plaza, where the fair‚Äôs heart pulsed strongest.

During that time I lost all sense of self and have been self-medicating with pot. I don't find any enjoyment in anything anymore. Skip forward to now my girlfriend has come more out of her shell and it's great but it left me very alone, she has a bad habit of making plans saying it'll be done at one time and then it becomes a whole day longer (specifically this time family dinner a one hour drive away) or do a complete 180 and changes everything drastically last minute and I've told her it bugs me when she does it. I and her have barely spent any time together recently too and if we do she's on her phone for a couple of hours when she wakes up and then she's off with her friend to coffee i don't hate she has a life but her friend sees her more than i see her( we've been together 4 years and live together) she's also come home smelling like cologne( not mine i can tell)
I've always had temp but i think this time i went too far i didn't hit her but i did break some of our stuff and took the piles of clothes she left over in the apartment over the past 2 years ( since we moved in) and dumped them on the spot on the couch she always sits. For more context, she doesn't help with any housework ie laundry, clean the cat boxes, take out the garbage, or picking up after herself(I'm a grown man i pick up after myself) I'm just at my wit's end and don't know what to do anymore i worked myself to the bone so she could get back on her feet and then i get walked all over my 4 year relationship is falling apart and i can't do anything but watch.

1k454wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k454wh/a_divine_rule/,A Divine Rule,"My name is Carter Paulson, I deliver nuclear weapons in a disguised 18-wheeler. I‚Äôve been working for this trucking company for 12 years and some change. I supply the truck, back into the loading bay of an undisclosed warehouse and deliver them to different secret military bases. Sometimes it‚Äôs a few pallets of ammunition or other amenities, sometimes it's a thermonuclear B83 gravity bomb. The government started developing new bombs capable of mass death and destruction. To put it in perspective, the Hiroshima bomb was 15,000 kilotons with a blast radius estimated to kill 70,000 to 140,000 civilians. The weapons I‚Äôve hauled are 24 times the size of that blast, what I picked up this morning is capable of so much more than that. I‚Äôve seen other truckers come and go, whether it has to do with management or staying clean long enough to finish a 10-hour day. Sometimes, I have to make a long trip, and that means sleeping in the bunk of the cab of my truck. I knew this was going to be a long haul so I asked my friend Ron to come with me. He‚Äôs also an experienced trucker, we met through this company but he was let go a little bit ago. Unlike me, Ron has a family and something to go home to every day, I‚Äôm still in the same apartment I moved into when I was 21 years old. I don‚Äôt have a wife or girlfriend, hell I don‚Äôt even have a dog to greet my entry and throw a ball once in a while.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt mind these long trips, I get out of my shitty apartment and see new things, I guess I was surprised when Ron said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to coming because I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want to be out of town that long. He waited for me at the entrance to the warehouse to pick him up, he climbed up in and I handed him a to-go mug of coffee and we were off. ‚ÄúHow are you, man?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúOh you know I can‚Äôt complain. Since the layoff, I‚Äôve just been picking up handyman cash jobs around the neighbourhood, how about you, Cart?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nice, yeah same old stuff around here. I could complain but who‚Äôd listen?‚Äù We both laughed and went back and forth till we got to the ferry where we‚Äôd make our first voyage. We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",2,1745209899.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

We put the truck in park and decided to walk to the upstairs area with the cafeteria. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that buzzing sound inside?‚Äù Ron asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll open the vents and see if I can hear it better‚Äù The humming was quiet, steady and kind of headache-inducing, honestly I wanted to throw up the closer I got. ‚ÄúIs it a fridge?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo no not a fridge, I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôm not too worried‚Äù When I hopped down from the side ladder on my trailer, I saw I kid staring at me through his backseat car window. He waved his toy semi-truck and trailer at me and excitedly yelled ‚ÄúWhat do you have in the trailer?‚Äù ‚ÄúIts-uhh‚Äù I stumbled on my words, and that‚Äôs when Ron‚Äôs dad's side of his brain kicked in to try and impress this child, he yelled back ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hauling the fastest race car in the world!‚Äù the kid's face lit up and we waved as the elevator door closed.

Standing in line we saw a small crowd forming at the bow of the ship ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a whale?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm not losing my spot in line‚Äù the captain's voice came over the speaker as we crept closer to the cafeteria ‚ÄúHello passengers, we are experiencing more aggressive waves than usual. It won‚Äôt disrupt our departure but taking a seat is recommended‚Äù. We watched three or four people get out of line and sit down which we only thought was funny because we thought everyone was being a baby about it. We both ordered the cheeseburger and fries and waited for our trays to come back around. The loudest shout came from the stairwell to the parking bay, it was a scream for help and it rang through the ship silencing any and all conversation around us. I couldn‚Äôt help myself and I followed the crowd toward the commotion when I saw what was the source of the decibel-breaking scream, I wasn‚Äôt prepared. 

I saw the mother of the child who excitedly took an interest in my truck, with her weeping son in her arms. He rolled over in pain holding his face while smoke oozed from between his fingers, his mom cried ‚ÄúHe was climbing on the trailer and tried to look inside and that‚Äôs when he fell off‚Äù. She removed her hand from the back of his head, releasing a stream of bright red blood. Shocked and disgusted she slapped her hand back on the open wound quickly and when she did his arms stiffened to his sides and he screamed in pain, dragging his hands away, revealing to the crowd his severely burnt eyes. Red and yellow blisters and boils plague the affected area around them. The once bright blue eyes were singed and clouded with nothing lying behind them, he screamed: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see! I CAN‚ÄôT SEE!‚Äù. So many thoughts were running through my head, I stepped backwards into the crowd and made no lasting impression praying the distraught mother doesn‚Äôt see me cowardly slinking back. I don‚Äôt know if that was the right thing to do, I couldn‚Äôt grapple with questions of right and wrong in the moment. Walking back up the stairs, the screams lay dormant in my eardrums. 

The captain's voice came over the speakers again ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna ask that everyone takes a seat as the waves are causing too much distress and commotion on board‚Äù. I saw Ron sitting down and saving a seat beside himself, I sat down next to him with my heart beating through my chest. I guess I wasn‚Äôt listening but he had to grab and shake me a bit before his voice finally registered in my head ‚ÄúCarter? Carter?!‚Äù breaking my trance I was asked, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was going on down there?‚Äù. I told him everything I saw and everything I expected to happen now, selfishly I knew something like this could cost me my job. Obviously, I hoped for a fast recovery for the kid but if the government finds out I was being sloppy and left the vents open for something so tragic to happen. If the boat crew decided to crack open my trailer to see the contents, I‚Äôd have to step in and lie. I‚Äôve been trained to do that, lie about there being harmful chemicals that could cause irrefutable damage if not properly suited. As much as Mother Nature tried to throw us off course our boat docked and we quickly got back to the truck with bated breath, hoping we don‚Äôt get pulled aside and questioned by any authorities. The boat ramp goes down and just as the metal clunks the cement, police with k-9 dogs walk on and start talking to the crew member. I looked at Ron and his face was a pale shade of white, I didn‚Äôt want to look back over at them until I saw Ron whisper under his breath ‚Äúshit‚Äù. my eyes dart back toward them and the cop is pointing directly at our truck instructing the crew to pull us over. One by one the cars cycled out in a pattern and we were last to get off. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and used the time to try and conjure up a lie before the cop got up to my window. 

One minute turned to five, and I finally looked in my side mirror to see what was going on. ‚ÄúWhy are there like 3 black SUVs now?‚Äù I said rhetorically. The police each walked up to the windows of them before even acknowledging me. The SUVs drove away, they had to of only been there for 30-45 seconds before they did and that‚Äôs when the cop walked over to me. He said nothing, didn‚Äôt ask for anything he just simply waved me through. Hesitation struck as I was obviously confused, Ron said ‚ÄúWell? Go!‚Äù The cop stared at my truck and trailer until we crested the corner, leaving the horrible situation behind us. It's been a few hours since we got off the ferry and every time I glanced in my passenger side mirror, I caught Ron sweating, twirling his thumbs. I was gonna ask him to switch seats in a while but looking at him, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be safe driving anything but himself insane. I break the silence ‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô all right, man?‚Äù He darted his head at me on a quick swivel ‚ÄúI-i-i don‚Äôt know if I can keep going‚Äù. What the hell is he talking about? Is he having second thoughts now? How do I tell him it‚Äôs too late? My delayed response was noticeable, I was asking all of these questions in my head when I should be honest with him. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know what to tell you. In about 30 miles is a rest stop with a motel. Why don‚Äôt we just sleep the rest of the night off and start chipper in the morning?‚Äù I could tell from the street lights that cascade his face every time we passed, he was crying but trying to be silent about it, he managed to mutter out ‚Äúok, I guess so‚Äù. 

The radio was practically useless, it had been since the whole trip started but I‚Äôd rather listen to the static of two stations fighting over my speakers than nothing at all at this point. As we pulled into the motel parking lot, I was unbuckling my seat belt he said ‚ÄúCarter, I think I‚Äôve hauled this trailer before. I think it cost me‚Äù. There is no way Ron has even laid eyes on this trailer, let alone whatever the hell is inside of it, but what he said perked my ears ‚ÄúWhat do you mean cost you?‚Äù His head hung low like a dog being punished for something bad ‚ÄúShe knows if I would‚Äôve had more time to get back on my feet‚Äù his cracking voice is muffled by his own sniffles ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do it, Carter‚Äù I cut him off ‚ÄúRon, its ok, we‚Äôll drop this off and I‚Äôll get you back to your family as soon as possible. I promise‚Äù. I went to grab both of our bags and he quickly snatched his out of my hands. ‚ÄúOk, ok. We‚Äôre in room 13. Bring it yourself,‚Äù I said as he threw his hood up and speed walked to the door. What is going on with him? I don‚Äôt get it. We walked in and Ron quickly made his spot known in the room. He said, ‚ÄúI saw a gas station behind the motel, I'm gonna grab some smokes. Do you want anything?‚Äù This is the first time in a little bit he isn‚Äôt being paranoid, I said ‚ÄúUhh sure, just some drinks or something‚Äù he nodded his head and slammed the door behind him.

I‚Äôm not a snoop or a creep but as I was flicking through the channels on the TV, something in me kept saying to open his bag. I was reluctant at first but curiosity got the best of me. I used every little lock on the door and drew the curtains, surely knowing he‚Äôd be back in a few minutes. I grabbed the bag and unzipped the top pocket. Normal things lay amongst the shocking discoveries, a packed lunch with a note from his wife next to Polaroids of her beaten and bloodied corpse. I wanted to puke, I could see Ron's hands in the pictures, holding weapons and fist-clenching lifeless tufts of hair of the the people I thought he considered to be his pride and joy. There had to of been 20 pictures in here, his kids had to of only been three or four. The photographs he took of them were haunting, a clear play-by-play with every photo having a date. I flipped through them noticing how the first date correlates with about the time he got laid off. I don‚Äôt understand, there‚Äôs no way Ron would‚Äôve done this to his family all because of a job loss. As I flipped through the Polaroids, every date got closer to the present day and every picture got worse along with it. Until I got to the last picture and it was the only one with the title ‚Äúa divine rule.‚Äù the picture paired with it was his family laying on the floor in puddles of their own blood and waste and some odd sigil patterns were scribbled around the walls. Upon looking at the back of the photograph, the dates were scribed beside three other dates labelled as death above each of them. Ron tortured his family for months and killed them the day before I picked him up. Just as fast as I put together the puzzle pieces in my head, the doorknob turns and fury follows once it doesn‚Äôt open.

I have to think fast, the pulling on the handle is getting violent. I grab the photos from his bag, put them in my bag along with my truck keys, run to the bathroom and lock the door. I looked for any way out I could, and I saw the fogged window leading outside. He‚Äôs kicking in the door, whatever sliver is holding the frame from busting open is buying me more time to find something to break the window. I took off the toilet lid and I heard the door finally swing open and hit the wall, all that was keeping me from Ron was this paper-thin motel bathroom door. I wound up my backswing and threw the porcelain lid at the glass and they both shattered on impact, I wasted no time jumping head-first through. I threw my bag out first so I could climb out easier. My upper body and right leg were outside the window and I went to jump the rest of the way and the pressboard and tin hinges finally broke through. Before I could even look back he grabbed my left ankle, it threw me off balance and I twisted as I slammed into the stucco siding. The more he pulled, the more I felt my hamstrings ripping and my ankle slowly being rolled by the grip of Ron's hands. With nothing but my leg being held inside, my body hung and my head almost touched the ground.

When I looked down as I was being yanked up, I grabbed a broken piece of frosted glass. Ron used all his weight to try and leverage me up and I took full advantage contorting my body into a crunch and catapulting my forearm forward plunging the jagged edge into his face, digging from the soft pink skin inside the corner of his eye downward to the bottom of his nostrils. He let go of me and I fell outside the window onto my back, Ron‚Äôs screams blared through the little broken window frame. I grabbed my bag and limped as fast as I could to my truck. I unlocked it and threw my bag up, not looking back I locked the door as soon as it slammed behind me. Started my truck and stepped on the skinny pedal. I refused to look in my mirror, I knew he was behind me. it was four forty-five in the morning when I looked at my radio and stopped using white knuckles on my steering wheel. The sun would be creeping over the highway's crest if it wasn‚Äôt disgusting and grey out. I drove through countless towns and different roads just in case Ron had any copy or mental memory of my route to my destination. It sounds crazy and paranoid but if he is as unstable as I think he is, he could be three steps ahead of me and I don‚Äôt even know it. He could be three times crazier than I‚Äôm expecting and already knows I‚Äôm dead. The sun‚Äôll be going down soon and I‚Äôm starting to realize I‚Äôm probably going to be sleeping in my truck another night, if I can just get to the destination before I have to do that I‚Äôd be content.

The rain beaded down my windshield and I noticed the GPS was telling me to turn down a dirt road and drive down it for another four and a half hours, I geared down and took the turn. Potholes plagued the road and left no room for going even close to the speed limit, the last leg of this trip just got extended because of bad upkeep. Bump after bump, I couldn‚Äôt imagine how much bubble wrap they had to pack my trailer with if they knew what this road was. I turned the corner and saw large white brick walls and a gate in between them. The closer I got, I saw a bald man outside the gates and I drove up towards him. His gun only became visually apparent when I was looking down and asking him ‚ÄúYou guys expecting me?‚Äù he lowered his sunglasses and looked me up and down. He revealed the scar carved between his eyebrows. I could still be paranoid, but it resembled the sigils that Ron had scribbled on his walls. 

Without saying a word, the gates open and he waved me through. This little community was bleak and eerie, with the white plaster over brick walls being reclaimed by nature with vines and rust running down the leaves and cracks from the unkempt steel and barbed wire on top. No concrete or pavement, and some walkways had inset stones leading to their building doors. The buildings were all different shapes and sizes not consisting of any more than a story tall, their windows being open holes with some having small doors of their own matching the front door that looked like a collection of pieces of wood almost something you‚Äôd see kids build for a clubhouse. Everyone who walked around stopped in their tracks as I rolled in and put it in the park. I climbed out and hopped onto the ground, I just wanted to leave this trailer here but I needed someone to sign my sheet and unload it with a forklift. I looked around and where I didn‚Äôt see a dilapidated structure, I met eyes. A priest touched my shoulder, sending me into a jump and everyone went back to what they were doing. ‚ÄúHi! We‚Äôve been expecting your arrival!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUhh hi. Do you have a loading bay or not?‚Äù I asked ‚ÄúNo need, Mr Paulson. Please, come with me‚Äù and he turned his back waving his bony fingers at me in a follow cadence. How does he know my name? Against my better judgment, I followed him.

 He brought me around almost every little shop and house explaining the cultural significance of why they are here and how far their important bloodline goes back. Maybe to some history buff, this would matter. It doesn‚Äôt to me in the slightest, so I say ‚ÄúHey sir, I do really appreciate the tour but I really need to get out of here, it's so late and..‚Äù he cut me off ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be unloaded till tomorrow, my son‚Äù. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. ‚ÄúOk, I'm going to sleep in my truck then sir. It‚Äôs been a long drive here and..‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you must stay at the local inn‚Äù God I really don‚Äôt want to stay anywhere around these people. I've had the worst feeling walking around here, the last thing I want to do is be stuck behind any of these doors. ‚ÄúUhm, really Father? I think I‚Äôd rather just sleep in my own bed‚Äù he looked at me with those graveyard undertaker eyes ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not up for discussion, my son. Please follow me‚Äù. Whatever gets me out of this place faster is for the better, I‚Äôll sleep one night here but I‚Äôm leaving as soon as I wake up. Whether there‚Äôs a forklift operator here or not, I‚Äôll open the back doors of my trailer and gun it through the gates. Leaving whatever cargo or nuclear weapon dropped off and delivered. He walked me into this dimly lit ‚Äúhotel‚Äù if one room down one hallway is a hotel. The innkeeper was just another cryptic old man, all of these people looked the same.

The orange light slowly faded as he walked me down the hallway and opened the door to my room. Wet carpet musk rung through the ammonia stench and he looked at me as if it wasn‚Äôt affecting him in the slightest. I walked in and he shut the door behind me and regret ran down my spine like sweat. For the first little while the smell remained the same but after a bit it morphed into a rotten fruit and dog shit aroma. Laying in my bed, the silence was louder than anything. Until I heard a soft and light ‚Äúhello?‚Äù come from the wall behind my head. Instantly whatever slumber I was in disappeared and I pressed my ear up against the wall and said ""Hello?"". A woman cried in response and whispered back ‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù. I leaned back and looked at the wall and locked eyes on the only painting in this room. I went to pop it off but they glued or nailed it to the wall when I pressed my ear up to it, I could hear her crying louder and clearer.

 I grabbed the edge of the canvas from inside the frame and ripped it revealing a small hole behind it with a cage-like wire mesh blocking the rest of the way. The hole has to only be 2 feet by 2 feet, definitely able to crawl through without the rest of the wire restricting my access. I went to grab it and pull but when I did I finally saw her stand up and say ‚ÄúSHHH!‚Äù and she pointed at the large man sleeping next to two other girls, clearly no longer living. The little light I had in my room was just shining on the man's turned back snoring away beside women with flies landing on their pale cold looking blue skin, surely eating away at their open mouths and eyes. I put my hand up to my mouth and tried to restrain my puke but it exploded from in between my fingers and my choking and gurgling sound caused the man's snoring to halt to a stop and I quickly and cowardly stuck the canvas back into the edges of the frame and laid in my bed, my heart beating so fast I couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. I cried in silence and held my breath with my hands reeking of vomit until I heard her again. ‚Äúno no, please. NO!‚Äù. From watching movies you‚Äôd expect punches to land with climactic and guttural cacophony but she stopped pleading as slaps hit the cement.

I tried not to think about it but the only thing I could acquaint the noise to was as if she was being picked up and slammed to the ground like someone shaking off a sheet or beach towel. Whether I slept throughout the night or not, it doesn't matter. I probably got a few minutes of shut-eye but those were accompanied by horrendous nightmares. As soon as I heard the first person outside I got up to walk out but walked straight into my door when it didn't budge at the turn of the handle. I banged my fist on the door demanding ‚ÄúHey! Why am I locked in here?‚Äù. Right afterwards I heard the keys unlock it from the other side, the innkeeper opened the door and I almost jumped at the sight of him. His face ballooned up with mustard piss yellow blisters, glistening ready to pop. He waved his arm in a bellhop manner and I walked out of that hell hole, passing where that woman's door would be but not to any surprise, there was nothing. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what happened last night. I could tell the sun tried to peek its way through the rain clouds today but it‚Äôs a losing battle. The priest greeted me as soon as I walked out of the inn, sitting up from a chair ‚ÄúGood morning, my son‚Äù his face being sickened by the same as the man inside. I stretched and replied, ‚ÄúMorning father, is your operator here yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúAhh yes please come this way‚Äù. He opened church doors and revealed wooden pues cascading up to an altar, sigils scribed behind each spot where someone would sit. The closer I got to them, I finally saw something I couldn‚Äôt make out if it was the blurry or scarred evidence I‚Äôd seen so far. It‚Äôs a circle with four forks and five points in an upside-down star sticking out each edge with a maze-like pattern that leads into a swastika. Looking back up at the altar, a huge nazi sigil was painted on the wall in red hand prints.

The priest turns around and says ‚ÄúDo you know what lies in the back of your trailer‚Äù. ‚ÄúUh no, I never really do. I need you to sign this right here‚Äù I handed him my clipboard and he put up his hand in rejection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy of what you have, I won't be signing anything"" ""Oh uhh, ok. Can you point me in the direction of someone worthy?"" he pointed at a painting and said, ‚ÄúWorth is measured in your commandments, my son‚Äù. The painting he pointed at was a large canvas with eleven to twelve men holding a large gold box and marching toward something. Honestly, I‚Äôm lost. I have no idea what is happening or what this old man was talking about but I‚Äôm one more vague answer away from disconnecting my trailer and flooring it through the gates. The closer I got to the painting, admiring the art and reading the gold title plaque ‚ÄúThe Ark Of The Covenant‚Äù. The priest piped up behind me and said in a preach ‚ÄúAnd when he gazed upon the arc, he gasped. You‚Äôll weep at my knees. Beg at my feet..‚Äù I slowly walked backwards towards the exit as he started shouting. ‚ÄúTake! TAKE! He demanded. Run! RUN! They begged once the insemination was complete. Abort your previous concentrations like the whore scorned and expelled her spawn!‚Äù. The door hit the back of my heel and the priest looked at me one last time before he fell, cracking his head on a pue on the way down. Blood pooled around his grey translucent hair, I took one step closer before he cried ""Divine... a divine rule"" as he licked his bright red brain matter and spinal fluid leaking from his head wound. I could hear the storm getting worse beyond the doors behind me. I opened the door and ran to the back of my trailer, as I grabbed the bolt cutters under my belly box to cut off this lock. A familiar face was hauled through the gate on a stretcher.

It was Ron, before he could roll over and see me I tucked myself behind the trailer. I could still hear him yell out ‚ÄúNo! We need to leave! We can‚Äôt be near that trailer!‚Äù. They restrained Ron down and dragged him into a building. I took a breath and stood up to open the trailer until I saw the bald man who was standing by the gate open the doors to the church and find the priest deceased. I‚Äôm panicking, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He back ran out and darted his head at me instantly. Stomping over he grabbed my bolt cutters and kicked me in the face, everything got fuzzy my ears were hot and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I was passing out. Before my eyes shut my cheek rests in the mud, I manage to see the man open the back of my trailer and a white ray of light shines from out the back like the glare of the sun on a snowy day and had to of blinded everyone for a second. My eyelids got heavy and before, I saw him covered in burns and boils, oozing from every crack and crevice. His painful scream in anguish accompanied my last light going out.

I woke up to the hot sensation of a fire near my skin and stumbled even lifting my head off the ground. Everywhere is burning, everyone can be heard screaming as they crumble up into ash conglomerate non-distinguishable from the next pile. I‚Äôm dazed and I can barely walk straight but the cargo is halfway drug outside my trailer. I swear It's the gold rectangular box, from the oil painting in the church. It‚Äôs buzzing so loud I can feel it in my teeth. I saw a man on fire run past me and tackle a lady lighting her in a blaze and they both sizzled and popped when their life force faded. All of my truck tires are popping around me from the heat, there's no way I could drive it out of here. I don't even think I can stand up. I grabbed it and crawled my way towards the exit, it felt futile even trying. The last of my time alive was spent clawing and crying at fire dirt, mud, and rocks. I thought I'd spend the last minutes of my life surrounded by loved ones, but I‚Äôm gonna die beside a fire-ridden cult who hail a gold box containing hope for them at one point. Instead, they were met with horrors beyond any of our comprehension, blindly following some divine rule.",0,1745209718.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

I just turned 30 and realize that I need to get exercise in everyday, but I also desperately need to get out of the house everyday as well. If I don't do it everyday, I lose the habit because I've just always hated exercising. I hate sweat, the smells, having to take a shower after, the time it takes, the way it makes me tired, and I get gym/social anxiety.

Me and my husband both WFH, so we almost never leave the house. I can tell it taking a toll on my mental health, social wellbeing, and physical health. My husband has very bad episodic insomnia, so I can't  expect him to have consistentancy going to the gym with me. Especially since I'm the type of person to want to get it out of the way in the morning, where as he would prefer to do it in the evening.

I lost nearly 100lbs 5 or so years ago by running on the treadmill everyday, but that isn't as much of an option now as it was. I got to a healthy wieght then, but I tend to get more easily injured working out now from over extending, twisting my knees or ankles running, or just general impact pain from my genetically flat af feet (thanks dad...). I wasn't working from home at the time and I was also helped being motivated by a competition at work for weight loss (I won).

I've gained some of it, like 30lbs, back and I just really want to get back there and just generally be healthier. I'm considering a personal trainer to show me the correct way to move my body, but I'm impatient and I feel like I need to do this now. There may be a gym that has them on staff, but they are a bit expensive and busy and Planet Fitness doesn't allow them anymore.

I want to try waking up 2.5 hours before work to work out (I'm terrible about waking up, but want to be better), this isn't my current routine, I usually roll outta bed after pressing snooze 4 times 30 mins before work for coffee. I want to stick with a routine. I want to lose the weight and feel healthy again. 

TLDR:
I want to get a routine to work out, but executive disfunction, getting hurt easily, not knowing how, and social anxiety is holding me back. Need to go to the gym to get out of the house for my mental health. May get a personal trainer to show how to not get hurt and work out what I need.

How do you all motivate yourselves to wake up and/or work out? Any tips?

It's leaving me to have about one day a week to myself  a week (Sunday), so instead of isolating in my house, I wanted to occasionally plan to go somewhere where it's a bit relaxing, where I can just read, work on designs on my iPad or work on my website on my computer, but also get out of the house leisurely. I am definitely open to coffee shops and breweries, however I have noticed sometimes they are a lot busier/louder on weekends. I might use some of these ideas also for potential simple dates if I need any ideas for the next couple months. 

Thank you in advance! I always love exploring new places in general, so I really look forward to the responses!",3,1745209269.0,Oceanside,3,0.81,False

We happened to find the Riserva in the back corner of a candy & liquor store in Matera, right next to the Lucano shop. We had a bag full of Lucano products, but luckily Mrs. IsntWitty convinced me to go in and poke around! With a rum base, it stands out in the Caffo portfolio. 

Standard Release  
(38% abv)
- On the nose, burnt caramel, sweet coffee liqueur, hints of cherry, toasted vanilla
- On the palate, coffee, blackstrap molasses, allspice, choke cherry, hints of black licorice 
- Medium+ sweetness
- Medium+ mouthfeel
- Medium to Medium- bitterness on the finish

Riserva 180th Anniversario
(45% abv)
- On the nose, sharper than the standard, with the sweet caramel pushed back and muted a bit, but with cherry wood and cedar notes 
- On the palate, definitely more pronounced heat from the higher abv. Coffee, cloves, allspice, chocolate, saffron, black licorice and hints of cardamom 
- Medium sweetness (slightly drier)
- Medium- bitterness 
- Medium mouthfeel 

Cheers everyone!
