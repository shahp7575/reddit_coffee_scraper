1lrukju,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_kurtshotgun/comments/1lrukju/discovered_my_first_2_big_mistakes_at_my_new_jb/,discovered my first 2 big mistakes at my new j*b,"today's oficially my first week in this j*b that I got at the bakery, and if I was to put it in cronological order, the first mistake would actually be the second. 

but around 4 to 5pm I served two older ladies (a daughter and her mother), they asked for a misto (bread, ham and cheese + a tad of butter), specifically in a type of bread called p√£o de forma (store bought white bread instead of the small homemade loaf we usually serve), which I thought meant that they would like the misto made with the homemade bread and they would also buy an entire loaf to take home. turns out we do serve mistos in white bread, and know I know where that is located. as soon as I put the misto in front of them the daughter pointed out my mistake and asked if I hadn't listened her (very politely of course, though idk how that would be phrased through text). I of course shocked, froze, and the owner steped in and told me to replace it and asked the oldest worker to help me, so she told me where to get the white bread and redid the misto for me while I dissapointedly cleaned the dishes.

the thing about this j*b is that when I first talked to the owner, she told me I'd be paid daily and by hour, which means that unlike my old jobs, which did let me know how much an hour of my time costs but I'd forget because of the monthly paycheck, I always have in mind the 10 reais per hour, which also means I'm constantly doing math, either calculating how much time of work the request of a cliente costs me (like half a cup of coffee costing 15 minutes), or how much my coffee break costs the bakery, or now how much my mistake costed. the answer is about an hour, each misto is 4.50 and I made 2, so short of 1 real. 

the older worker told me it's okay, still felt a bit guilty and I wondered what they would do to the wrong mistos (which the client said they'd be fine to take), I was hoping we would get to eat them or that at least they wouldn't be thrown out (and the last one I hope the most, I hate waste). 

the owner seemed a bit moody and so was I, but skipping to 1 or 2 hours later, when my shift ends, I sat at the floor outside the bakery to take out my hair net and pop my earphones in. before I could even do that, a lady approached me. I had been kinda observing her at the other side of the street because I recognised her and her son, but also a very nice old guy who always has the same request: 2 golden brown flour cakes (11,90 each, 23.80 for 2, about 2 hours of work or half the day), and unlike the old guy she seemed to be observing me along with her little boy. 

her approach was asking me if I worked there, saying that yesterday someone sold her a fake plastic donut (which I discovered at the beggining of today's shift that we have on display) but she was too scared to go inside and, the owner seeing her, getting mad at the worker, which yay! was me!!! 

i warned her my shift had ended, but that I just realised that I had forgotten my water bottle inside, and I would go in with her and find a way for her to talk to a worker without getting attention from the owner, which I did by telling her to go in the corner of the donut display and me going in in to get my water bottle. 

i think it ended up being fine, I'm happy that she came back and got her son a real one, no cost, and I hope the owner didn't notice, specially cuz it was me. 

working there I've been even more aware of something that has been under my attention for a while, I'm scared to death of making mistakes. every time I need to sell something I already know the price of I need to ask the older workers to confirm the price, so that I don't ruin it, but most of the time I'm right, and that bothers me yk? specially cuz I don't like to bother people and I also like doing stuff sure of myself. 

but at the end of the day it's fine ig, and I got this j*b where I work with people so that I get over a little bit more of my social anxiety and other little things I stuggle with. mistakes will happen, I've been sure of it from the begging, and they won't stop frustating me, but I'll be able to control them sooner enough. I've been getting better already, I can do the basics very well, and making people's orders ain't bad, I'm happy at my 1 week progress, plus the money is better than my last jobs, around 150 reais more + I've been actually enjoying it (I hated the others from start) + it's closer to home, so no public transport, which ain't bad I like taking the bus, but that would mean a lot of time traveling, and not having to do that I can go home, get ready lazily and eat lunch, instead of going straight from school and a stomach full of microwaved nasty bean soup, rice, vegetables and meat. 

I'm happy, and calculating the hours I'm sure I'll be able to save up better (I need 200 for the eye doctor, 60 for the gym (monthly), and 580 for an end of year trip), purchase wisely, and also feel more satisfaction, which I didn't getting my paycheck before. wednesday I bought a shirt and a skirt worth 3 days of work (I also still have saved up money from last year so it was fine), I like it.

1lruk0u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lruk0u,tiny kitchen vs comically large microwave- any suggestions?,"I just moved in a new apartment and I'm currently in the process of setting everything up. I bought a 2-cu microwave (19 D x 13 H x 24 W) from a sale but it leaves me with very little counter space to work with. I was wondering if anybody had suggestions for how to free up the space a bit. Here are some options I considered and my thoughts:

**Moving the keurig and air fryer to the upper bar area behind the counter**
This frees up more space but makes those appliances harder to reach.

**Moving the microwave to where the drying rack is, then using the dish washer as a drying rack or using one of those over the sink rolling racks**
Probably inconvenient when doing the dishes.

**Putting a microwave cart / sideboard against the ledge to the side of the counter, then putting the microwave there**
I feel like that spot would be better suited for trash and recycling. I was thinking about getting one of those double tilt out trash cabinets and putting the microwave on top, but none of the ones I found are deep enough for the microwave, or have some sort of drop leaf counter that would leave an awkward gap.

**Putting the microwave in one of the cabinet spaces**
 This sounds very inconvenient.

**Buying a smaller microwave**
I would like to avoid this option by all means possible.

**Putting a sideboard buffet table or a rolling island in the dining room area along the wall where all my stuff currently is, then putting the microwave there**
This could be cute and the area could double as a coffee bar. My biggest issue with this is having to leave the kitchen area to access the microwave, which can be a bit awkward depending on how it's executed.",6,1751666455.0,femalelivingspace,3,1.0,False

I'm a BITS dropout, working in tech for more than a year now. In that dream job phase, earning enough to buy most of the things I crave and I can start enjoying and experiencing. I have nothing to complain towards my life.


I didnt focus on enjoying at all until now.

Not at all bad looking, just a little short (163 cm).

Was focused completely on studying, skills and gym until I dropped out.

Never dated, as I‚Äôm a productive guy but got good empathy, accountability, and kindness.

All people my age are still in college. My colleagues are older and my job is fully remote now after switching companies ‚Äî so I have zero social circle at the moment.

I tried all dating apps.  And most matches I do get are either emotionally unavailable, looking for something quick and fast-paced, or just created profiles out of anger or disappointment. They don‚Äôt seem to believe in love or building something real. Also, I believe due to my height I‚Äôm getting filtered out.

How do people in Bangalore meet someone genuine?

Not into clubbing or bar scenes. Just want to find someone who's curious, kind, and wants to grow together ‚Äî not just short-term fun.

I'm looking for someone who's curious, emotionally aware, kind, and wants to grow together - not just for romance, but to build something meaningful as a team. Someone who wants to do normal things like go to caf√©s, chill, talk ideas, support each other's goals, and genuinely connect.

I have a concept where i want the person to come on a date for a cafe, we can work 45 min, yap 15 min, work 45 min again, 25 min long break eating, coffee together.  Once it pasts evening , a simple movie or park or some kinda walk or any preferred chilling and enthusiastic activity, dropping her at her safest place.

How can i start? Im a Telugu guy for anyone if it concerns.

Im not looking for options and choosing the best, one love compatible like minded,  honest, empathetic and with a cute smile üôÇ. Nothing else... its fine if the other person wants to give just a try and then decide about long term, but im looking for one fulfilled long relationship!!

I somehow made up my mind, no one in my age of females will want this kind, even if they want then they wont be in dating apps unless its a pure accident.

Issues:  
Before I tried to fix my sleep schedule, I was going to bed at 4 am, falling asleep around 7 am after scrolling on my phone, and then waking up around 3:30 pm. Obviously this is a problem so I made several changes to my behaviors. I have a personal rule that I must stop working at 1:30 am, which a room of error of 15 minutes. At 12:30 am my phone also goes into bed time mode, turning off notifications and limiting the screen to only show in black and white until the next morning. Now, I go to bed around 2 am, fall asleep around 3:30 to 4 am, and wake up around 11:30 am.

The problem that has been plaguing me recently, however, is that at a certain time in the day, my energy drains super low. I feel like I am not getting enough energy, as I get a sense of fatigue extremely quickly within the day, spiking after I walk my dog at 4 pm. Today, as an experiment, I went to bed even earlier at 1 am, and went to sleep around 3:00 am. I disabled my alarm, allowing my body to naturally wake up around 1 pm. I have not done any work today, so I should not be fatigued. Despite this, after walking with my dog on a shorter, less intense route than usual, 30 minutes to an hour afterwards I was hit with intense fatigue. This may be because I have not drank coffee or tea yet today, but Ive only begun drinking coffee a week or two ago, with the caffeinated tea Ive been drinking being fairly light.

Past Experiences:  
In the past, while I was in the dorms of my college, I did an experiment to see when I do my best work. It turns out, I typically wake up around noon, with a first wind an hour or so after I wake up.

Why do they think that going on a first date with basketball shorts or joggers (one time stained and with a hole) is okay? We‚Äôre not going on a rage room that splashes paint all over you, we‚Äôre not going to the gym. We‚Äôre going to get some food or a coffee. I would be more inclined to ignore this if I were a college student, and even then it would be a point against them, but if you are over the age of 25, grab some pants, some jeans, even cargo shorts work, but for the love of whatever is holy to you, do not go in basketball shorts or sweatpants unless you are going to the gym. 

For me is like that‚Äôs the effort that you are willing to put in the relationship, and I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs mom, I‚Äôm not going to start acting like I am, you should know to dress to impress when it comes to going on a date. If this is your average amount of effort, when looking for a long term relationship, then you are no longer under consideration, because I don‚Äôt want to get stuck doing most if not all of the emotional labor and I have the feeling I would be if I let the dates continue.

So that‚Äôs my advice for guys who are going on dates. Put some pants on, dress as if you are going to the movies for the first time with the girl you‚Äôve had a crush on for a year and she just started to talk to you.

1lru6tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/hvacadvice/comments/1lru6tn/nest_nightmare/,Nest Nightmare,"I've had a Nest Thermostat for a number of years now. Small house (<1500 sq ft). Gas, forced air furnace, roughly 5 years old. Central air unit 3 years old.

Nest seems fine in heating mode, but in cooling mode has completely a mind of it's own. Seems to set itself to whatever the hell it wants, whenever it wants.

I most always set it to 24¬∫C (cooling) through summer months, until it gets oppressively hot. Every time I check it, it's at something else, seemingly at random. 27¬∫, 29¬∫, 22¬∫, 21¬∫. Sometimes it will change itself only a few minutes after coming on. Sometimes during heat-waves it won't come on... I'll check it and it's set to 29¬∫. I change it to 23¬∫. AC will come on, run for 5 or 6 minutes then promptly turn off. I check the nest, it's set at 27¬∫ or 29¬∫ again ??

Other times (usually when it's relatively cool outside), I'll set it at 24¬∫ in case the inside temp creeps above that. Some time later the AC switches on... I check the Nest thermostat and it's set to 21¬∫ or 22¬∫. I'll turn it back to 24¬∫. AC takes like at least 3 or 4 minutes to stop running, then less than 10 minutes later it comes back on... I check the Nest... yep... 22¬∫ again.

Seriously, WTF? I'm one missed morning coffee away from ripping it off the wall and replacing it with an oldstyle ""dumb"" thermostat... set and forget.

I have RESET the thermostat software numerous times. Still reverts to the same thing eventually. At one point I read that you could turn off the predictive software to essentially run it as a ""dumb"" thermostat. I tried it. It did exactly nothing.

I don't want to fidget with scheduling. Doesn't really work here anyway... it can be 17¬∫ outside one day and 30¬∫ the next, and both my wife and I work from home, so scheduling is pointless. We just want to be comfortable. Doesn't feel like a big ask.

Ideally, I'd just like it to operate like a dumb thermostat... no learning... no predictive BS... just do what I tell it - when I tell it. Any helpful advice is appreciated.

I have a legal question that I couldn‚Äôt find any answers for online. I hope this is the right sub to ask, if not please let me know!

I have been as a server in a restaurant in Berlin for almost two years now. A couple of months ago, I thought I might try to negociate a raise, as I had been working there for a while and everything was going well.

I asked the owner if we could meet for a chat, and she agreed to the raise (which was about 10%). She did specify that if she was going to pay me more, she would like to be sure that I will not quit anytime soon, especially as the busy summer season was about to begin. I assured her that I had no plans to leave the company anytime in the coming months. This all happened back in May, in an informal chat over coffee.

Fast forward to today (early July). The owner texted me to let me know that she had left my new, updated contract in the office for me to sign. I picked it up at the beginning of my shift, and I discovered a clause stipulating that I was now OBLIGATED to stay in the company for at least ONE MORE YEAR, if I was to receive the raise we agreed upon.

I have never agreed to any of this, neither the clause or the one-year time frame. This was all done without consulting me.

After talking to my colleagues, I have discovered that the owner has pulled a similar move on at least one another person.

Is that even legal in Germany?

I (32 F, India) am stuck in a weird dilemma with an arranged marriage rishta. The guy is a pilot‚Äîfirst officer, has been flying for 2.5 years, seems financially stable, and has a respectable job on paper.

But the problem is‚Ä¶he seems extremely underconfident and socially awkward. He avoids calls and video chats, barely makes any effort in conversations, and always keeps his social media private or hidden. When we met in person (twice), I noticed odd things‚Äîlike him not knowing how to stir coffee despite being a frequent traveler and staying in hotels during layovers. Also, his conversation skills are quite weak, both in English and in general.

He also admitted he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a call person‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt like video calls even with family. His texting style is very bland and immature, and although he shows interest in marriage, he says he‚Äôs ‚Äú90% sure‚Äù about this match but doesn‚Äôt bother to get to know me deeply, saying he‚Äôs afraid of overstepping because it‚Äôs an arranged setup.We had some good chats initially where i felt he was making efforts to gauge our compatibility but later on now then chats are only surface level and draining sometimes!

This whole situation has made me uncomfortable and confused. My family really likes him because he has a stable job, and they‚Äôre quite invested in this rishta. But I can‚Äôt shake off the feeling that something is off here‚Äîlike low confidence, lack of self esteem,poor social skills, or lack of emotional depth. Also, I don‚Äôt feel excited or emotionally connected to him at all, and I‚Äôm scared of being pushed into this marriage out of pressure.
Despite being a pilot, he lacks grooming, communication skills and confidence.

Writing Sample: He sat in the corner of the cafe as she entered the building, it was as if she demanded the attention of everyone just by existing.  He kept a nonchalant eye on her, not wanting to be accused of being a creep or staring, but he couldn't help but continue to look.  Her long blonde curls bounced softly as she walked towards the counter.  The clatter of dishes being thrown into the sink, the bathroom door swinging open and shut, and the quiet hum of the heater running snapped him back to reality from his day dreams.  Again, for just a brief moment, images of ropes, candle light, steam, and sheets filled his mind.  *Clang* The beautiful woman sat down in front of him and began to speak. 

""My name is Paige. I'm new here."" She smiled at him shyly before taking another sip of coffee. ""I guess you could say that I'm looking for someone to show me around town?"" The words came out easily, like they had been rehearsed or something, charming and seductive, yet seemingly totally innocent. His heart pounded fast, and his mouth went dry. ‚ÄúWell,"" he started, ""I would definitely love to show you around!""",1,1751664651.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

So I charged the remote.  Next day, still not working.  Go on a business trip, come home... it works.  The next day, not working.  Now the remote doesn't work at all.  I followed every single instruction I can find on the interwebs and cannot get the remote to pair.  I even reset the entire Apple TV using the Remote app on my phone.  This Apple TV is my Homekit hub and now nothing works properly.  I cannot get the remote to pair because the buttons necessary to do so do not do anything with the Apple TV box.  You can see the little white light blink when I press any button, so it's getting signal, but it's not doing anything with that signal.  There does not seem to be able kind of hard reset option on either the Apple TV or remote, so I fear I have a bricked setup for no discernable reason.  It's, of course, 2 months past the warranty period and I did not think I would need Apple Care on a TV box considering my ROKU devices still work after a gazillion years.

Has anyone experienced this and came up with a solution?  I will try a new remote but I'm extremely unhappy about needing to spend $60 for a remote when I already have one and there's no reason why it'd stop working.

Even with all the stupid politics happening here I would at least like to giggle today. I'm currently drinking and playing Cyberpunk 2077 - yup I'm cool. Also have random YouTube videos playing in the background. 

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. As of I'm playing Cyberpunk. Destiny 2 too but not as much since the new expansion is a month out. And helldivers. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or would be up game on Xbox or ps5. And spamming me pet pics. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact.

The type of store where the coffee tastes like dirt, and you still have to come inside to pay for gas. Most nights the lights inside buzz louder than the occasional car that drifts by. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs Peaceful, if not for the constant hum of the old AC unit rattling the ceiling vents.

It started around 3 in the morning. Nothing good happens at 3 in the morning. I hadn‚Äôt had a single customer since midnight, and at least an hour since a car had passed by.

I‚Äôd just finished mopping the bathroom when I heard a scraping sound above me like nails dragging across sheet metal. I froze under the flickering fluorescent lights, mop still in my hand dripping onto the tile. It wasn‚Äôt the AC this time, I knew what that sounded like. It was all too familiar. This. This had rhythm. Like it was deliberate. Too heavy for a rat. Hell, it was too heavy for a raccoon.

I walked back behind the counter, trying to shake it off. Probably just loose fittings and the ducts came loose. Figured I‚Äôd just let the manger know in the morning. I turned the volume up on the radio. An old led zeppelin song was on and I tried to ignore the vent, but the noise didn‚Äôt stop. Instead, it got louder.

Now it was above the coffee station, then the snack aisle. Something crawling. I could hear its weight shift with each movement. Then a dull thump. Something dropped inside the vent. Something wet?

I grabbed the step stool and climbed up, and pulled the vent cover off to peek in.

It was pitch black. I  turned on my phones flashlight and pointed it into the duct. At first, nothing. Just dust and rust. Then I saw it. Something pulled back.

Not ran. Not scurried off. Pulled. Like it knew I was watching.

I stumbled back, heart pounding. The light flickered, as I slipped from the step stool. The ducts rattled. It was moving towards the vent and fast. I quickly climbed back up and slammed the vent shut, locking it back in place.

I called my manager. No answer. I called the police. Said it was probably just an animal and animal control wouldn‚Äôt be available to get out there for a few hours.

Are you a sucker for Cyberpunk? Do you enjoy relatively hard sci-fi detective-noir stories set in the near future?  Do you enjoy stories with serious themes, yet enough humor to leaven the final product?  Well then, you might enjoy this story!*  

*This tale is set in the world of tomorrow; one shackled to the problems of today. A world bound by the laws of thermodynamics, where faster-than-light travel is the stuff of science fiction and teleportation is a mad fever dream. This story takes place in the next century, where late-stage capitalism and increasing reliance on genetic and cybernetic optimization has produced a mistrusted transhuman minority class. This is a world where the promise of a better tomorrow has been broken to pieces, where science couldn't lift humanity beyond our nature, or even beyond our solar system.*

*Where humanity previously surged from Earth on waves of subliminal chemical rockets and fusion engines, surfing the tsunami of accelerated scientific development, we now stagnate. The collapse of the tech bubble and the following economic crash precede years of armed conflict, leaving humanity scattered across the solar system in an aborted diaspora. In a society where life is cheap and everything else is expensive, an increasingly cyber-civilization wars with itself as unmodified humans retaliate against a future that left them behind.*

*This is a world in which technology has improved by leaps and bounds, but where people are still chained to the economic systems we 'enjoy' today. It's a world where unmodified (or 'baseline') humans find their abilities increasingly obsolete, and their skillsets ever less competitive in job markets filled with made-to-order AI. In this world, in defiance of the saccharine dreams of futurists and transhumanists and tech-cultists everywhere, utopia remains a fantasy. In a time when technology has advanced to the point of human-mind uploading and interplanetary travel, capitalism is still king.*

*The creaking, ad-hoc system flounders at the straining limits of its decaying reach. Oligarchs and mega-corporations feud over the isolated clusters of civilization among the void. A pseudo-government, formed to reign in the remnants of armed conflict and underground factions, finds itself policing a semi-lawless frontier beyond the core planets. Code Enforcement Officers desperately try to stem the tide of malware, hackers, and evolving synthetic life undermining the digital systems on which humanity relies. But don't worry; even in the darkness of the future, for the beleaguered digital cop, there will still be coffee.*

**Synopsis:**

Both as a cop and a person, Lieutenant Mel Cruz is consistently dealt a crap hand.¬† She's a jaded officer coming to terms with the wreckage of her romantic life, a near fatal injury, and an acerbic new captain.¬† Following her transfer to a new unit, she desperately tries to hold her life together while rebuilding her career.¬† Oh, and she's a 34-year-old Scouting Officer for the Code Enforcement branch of the Exonet Maintenance Bureau.¬† To put it in Luddite, she's a cyborg law enforcement officer, and digital systems are her beat.

Follow our protagonist on a journey of healing and found family, as well as terrifying and profound explorations of the nature of humanity and sentience.¬† Lieutenant Cruz will have to adjust to life in the sticks of the Jovian system, build relationships with her colleagues, and still manage her weekly caseload of digital crimes.¬† A.I.s and humans alike will feature prominently in a story where the characters must weigh the measure of non-human life.¬† And behind the innocent facade of this backwater mining port lurks something new and dark that's eating out the heart of Ursa Miner Station.

Be prepared for snark, LGBTQ+ themes, occasional violence, and lots of cyber-everything in a relatively hard sci-fi shell!

Alex always shows me the messages which I appreciate but then he asks what I think he should do. Like he wants my permission to respond. When I tell him I'm not comfortable with the constant contact he says ""but she's going through a hard time and she doesn't have many friends.""

Here's where it gets weird though. Yesterday she texted him saying she left some stuff at his place and needs to pick it up. They broke up over a year ago. What stuff could she possibly need now?

Alex seems to think this is all normal and that I'm being jealous. He keeps saying they're just friends and that I need to trust him. But she's clearly not over him right? And he's being way too accommodating.

I don't want to be the controlling girlfriend but this feels like more than friendly conversation. She's always reaching out when she's sad and he always responds immediately.

1lrtgs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1lrtgs5/neighborhood_recs/,Neighborhood Recs,"Hello! I am relocating to STL with my family and I would like to hear general recommendations on neighborhoods. I'm about 30 years old with a wife and toddler and I've lived in mid-size towns and big cities (Grand Rapids, Charlotte, Chicago). I've struggled to get a good feel for neighborhoods in STL after some initial research so I've turned to the experts of Reddit! 

I hope to find a family-friendly urban neighborhood for the first couple of years I'm in STL. I will also note that I'll be working downtown. My early research has pointed to Central West End, Tower Grove, Shaw, Lafayette Square, and Benton Park. Is there any reason to prefer one of these neighborhoods over another? Am I missing any neighborhoods?

I think family-oriented, low crime, walkability, parks, and coffee (I miss the local coffee shops in Chicago) are my important factors. Affordability is a big plus (median house valued around $325-375 k or so) and good schools in case we stay a bit longer is also a big plus. I know parts of the city have great historic brick homes which I would find very appealing. 

If there isn't an obvious match I'd be open to suburbs that may carry some of the city feel. I have heard that Kirkwood might offer this. Is it accurate to say most of the sought neighborhoods and suburbs are west of downtown? If there are any suburbs with a walkable downtown, good schools, low crime I'm open to considering these. 

Apologies if the post seems all over the place but I'm fairly early in my research and wanted to throw all of my thoughts in here. Thanks!!",0,1751663366.0,StLouis,10,0.5,False

1lrtfy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/asda/comments/1lrtfy4/aisle_distribution_procedure/,Aisle Distribution Procedure,"Had a formal meeting today discussing aisle distribution, namely the fact I am always placed in the heavy aisles compared to a section leader who does exclusively light aisles and often has help doing so. During which I was told that because I am an ‚Äúexperienced colleague‚Äù (18 months service) I should be doing heavy aisles every shift. I asked if this was a fair distribution process and the manager said yes. Following these rules the section leader who has worked for asda about 5 years now, should be in heavier aisles than me.

Is this the case?

For context on the aisles I complete:
-world foods, rice+pasta etc
-tinned, condiments and cooking, noodles etc
-entirety of health and beauty
-Bws (2 aisles)
-Non-edible (2 aisles)
- and occasionally frozen

Granted this is completed with another colleague but the section leader only does tea and coffee (half is seasonal), sweets (half is juice), biscuits (half is cereal), home baking.

Whats everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this split, its a superstore for reference.

1lrtfk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1lrtfk9/just_spent_9_days_in_scotland_edinburgh_skye_our/,Just spent 9 days in Scotland (Edinburgh + Skye) - Our faves & tips!,"Greetings! My husband and I just returned to the US after a great trip to Scotland, and I thought I'd pay back the great suggestions and tips I got from Reddit by now sharing some of my own. I'm by no means an expert or anything - these were just our favorite places and some suggestions :)

* **Itinerary:**
   * Arrived and had two days in Edinburgh (stayed in Dean Village - really, really beautiful and peaceful, far enough outside of the tourist action while still accessible). There is a lovely river you can walk along (Water of Leith).
   * Rented car, drove to Glencoe for one night (beautiful - definitely recommend)
   * Drove to Isle of Skye, stayed for two nights (incredible, would stay an extra night next time)
   * Drove to Pitlochry, stayed for one night on way back to Edinburgh so that we wouldn't have a super long drive (very cute little town)
   * Returned to Edinburgh for two nights (stayed in a suburb called Meadowbank, east of the main part of the city but still accessible)
* **Fave Places in Edinburgh:**
   * Favorite neighborhood: Stockbridge! This is a really charming area that was a short walk along the Water of Leith from our stay in Dean Village. A great selection of coffee shops/bakeries, restaurants, and shops.
      * Our favorite shop in Stockbridge was Skout, which carries a curated selection of vintage/antique/artist-made items. We would have bought out the store if we could have. Great if you like trinkets, unique gifts, ""quirky"" (sorry) old stuff... we just loved it. Perfect for a special gift to bring home that isn't like... a highland cow keychain. Not that there's anything wrong with that... Note that it is only open Thurs - Sat.
   * Favorite restaurants/coffee shops:
      * Dulse: Scottish seafood, upscale-ish, with good wine. There are two locations: one in Leith and one in Westend. We went to Westend. Insanely delicious mussel dish, scallop dish, Langoustines... just really good. Nice gelato across the street too.
      * Mootz General Store: Sandwich shop in Stockbridge, serving delicious Italian-inspired sandwiches on schiacciata bread (similar to focaccia). Our fav sandwich was the Mootz: Mortadella, stracciatella, pistachio pesto, crushed pistachios. I wish I could eat this all the time.
      * Makars Mash: Ooomg. High quality Scottish comfort food. We had the wild boar sausage with butter mash and a side of haggis. Everything was amazing. There are vegetarian options too. There are walk-ins but I suggest a reservation because it was packed even at lunch time.
      * Howies: Yum. Seasonable Scottish food, great cocktails. We went to the Victoria location which was in the thick of a very busy tourist area but well worth it. Their Cullen Skink ruled.
      * Seventy One Steps: A bakery and bagel shop that is ""seventy one steps"" from The Bearded Baker, another great bakery. We had heard they had good bagels, and the rumors were true. The smoked mackerel and smoked salmon bagels were incredible.
      * LOWDOWN (coffee shop): Great beans and pour over. I also had an excellent matcha latte.
      * Fortitude and Artisan (coffee shops): Great ""batch brews"" for the real coffee heads.
   * Bookstores:
      * Typewronger Books - Small indie bookshop with small but solid selection, including zines. Shares its location with McNaughtan's right next store, which has antiquarian books.
      * Topping and Company Booksellers: Another indie bookshop, this one much larger, with all new books (no used). Amazing place for browsing. Really excellent selection of art books/monographs.
   * Favorite sights:
      * Just walking around honestly. We took side streets and went through neighborhoods. The architecture is stunning everywhere you look. We put a lot of miles on our shoes.
      * Rosslyn Chapel: A short drive from the city and super beautiful.
* **Fave Place in Glencoe:**
   * We were only there for one night, so not a ton to report, but if you like seafood you must go to Lochleven Seafood Cafe. A casual spot for lunch or dinner with theeee freshest seafood. Oysters, mussels, crabs, lobster... etc. It was really pretty in Glencoe and it would have been nice to have another night.
* **Fave Places on Isle of Skye:**
   * Skye itself was just unbelievable. Driving around through the greenery was mind blowing. If you have the opportunity to drive it, do (more on driving later...). We stopped by some of the famous sites (Neist Point Lighthouse, The Fairy Glen, Old Man of Storr), but our favorite times were just stopping the car and taking short walks and gawking at everything.
   * The Old School Restaurant: A nice restaurant that was a school in the 1870s. Pretty laid back with solid food. Things book up really fast on Skye so make a reservation well in advance.
   * Bog Myrtle Cafe: Perfect breakfast at a cute cafe filled with used books you can buy. Simple food, great espresso drinks, nice people. Just a perfect place to have a bite.
   * The Giant MacAskill Museum: Trust me. Just go to this.
   * Anywhere sheep were present (i.e. most places). They will def be on the road/side of the road (does anyone know why they like the grass on the side of the roads so much? Petrol flavored?) so do be careful if driving.
* **Pitlochry**:
   * Cute place, but nothing major to report. It seemed like there were a good number of tourists and being there only one night we didn't get a chance to explore very much. It was definitely worth it to stop there on the way back to Edinburgh, though, because we were tired! If we had more time there I think there would have been a lot of beauty to see.
* **General Tips**
   * I'm going to say something really obvious but... bring rain gear! We were caught in rain (and intense wind) a few times, and were really glad we'd brought rain jackets, waterproof boots, and an umbrella.
   * Driving! If you'll be driving and coming from a part of the world where you do not drive on the left side, watch some videos on YouTube first to learn some tips, look up/learn the road signs, and have a co-pilot if you can. My husband drove the whole time and I was navigator and this helped immensely, as he was focused largely on the driving itself (it was a real learning curve for a few days) and I was able to navigate while he did that. Ultimately, I would say that driving is totally doable, but definitely watch some videos and learn the rules first. There are tons of rules about passing, parking/stopping, etc.
   * Speaking of parking, you need to pay for parking just about everywhere you go, including in small towns. We ended up downloading the RingGo app at the suggestion of our taxi driver and that allowed us to pay for parking wherever we went without carrying a bunch of coins around. A note on this: we had to register for the app in a browser, not on the app. I'm not sure why, but it seemed to have something to do with the country code. Also note that using this app will mean you incur a foreign transaction fee with your bank unless you have a card that doesn't have one. They are usually pretty minor but it helps to look this up beforehand.
   * A lot of shops are only open certain days. For example, we noticed in Edinburgh that a lot of stores were closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. For this reason we missed going to some of the spots we had on our list to visit (I really wanted to go to an antique store called Unicorn Antiques, but we weren't able to because of our schedule). If there are any places you are hoping to visit when you're there, look up their schedules first!

OK wow that is a lot. In summation, we loved our trip, and next time we'd add a few more days. I hope this helps someone who was searching like me! Thank you, Scotland, for the hospitality. Cheers!",18,1751663273.0,uktravel,6,1.0,False
1lrte8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chinavisa/comments/1lrte8w/chinese_visa_my_experience_in_stockholm/,Chinese visa - My experience in Stockholm,"Thought I‚Äôd share my experience getting a Chinese tourist visa (L) via the Chinese visa application centre in Stockholm, Sweden. 

I started by filling out the online application - this is not done on a coffee break be sure you have enough time (to get to frustrated, walk away and come back)!

I had some trouble getting the website working, what at last worked was using the Firefox browser. Tip: don‚Äôt click things to many times it will break the form and you‚Äôll have to start over. 

The next morning I got the email ‚Äùrejected for modification‚Äù, twice, as i had forgotten to upload some documents. I resubmitted it and 3 days later I got an ‚Äùapproved‚Äù email and was able to proceed to the centre. 

If you just search for the visa application center Stockholm it will show ‚Äùpermanently closed‚Äù, that is because they have moved and slightly modified their name. The adress you want is Hang√∂v√§gen 29!

I carefully read what documents to bring, made a detailed travel itinerary, printed everything, signed it, took a photo (the Swedish I‚Äôd-size 35x45 is fine it doesn‚Äôt have to be 33x48) and brought it all to Stockholm (about 2,5h away). 

I got there early as i was expecting a long queue, but I was the only applicant in the building and got to the counter in record time. The man asked for my approval document - as it happens this was THE ONLY thing I‚Äôd missed in my careful research - but he was able to put in the numbers manually and just asked me to bring it next time. I gave him my passport, paid and then he said bye bye!

I was confused, what about my documents? I asked and the reply was that I had already submitted everything online. This freaked me out since I became worried they wouldn‚Äôt think that was enough but I left the center with a receipt and instructions to come back in 4 days. 

After 4 worried days I went back, now a little bit later in the day as for the empty halls that met me the first time. This time there was a whole other person before me - she seemingly asked a question and left and then it was my turn. 

The same man as last time now did not want my printed approval email - as that is only for passport submissions - and was happy with my receipt. He proceeded to hand me my passport, and showed me the visa inside it, told me the validity and wished me a pleasant trip. I think he could see me beaming with relief and happiness because for the first time he cracked a smile. 

I left the building with my passport and visa and went to buy a celebratory ice cream in Gamla Stan. ",0,1751663177.0,Chinavisa,2,0.5,False

1lrt901,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lrt901/to_the_man_i_love/,to the man i love,"Dear B:

You gave me a card on valentine's day last year. It had two raccoons, your favorite animal, holding each others‚Äô hands and kissing. You wrote in that card ‚ÄúH, I‚Äôm still surprised each day that I love you even more than the last,‚Äù among other things. I hung that card up by my desk. I would look at it daily. Everytime I worked, it served as a reminder of our love and unique relationship. In my phone case, for 3 years, I had a polaroid taken a couple months after we met. When I was feeling down, I would have that polaroid to remember your touch and love when I needed it most. When I went to Washington D.C. this year, I bought a tiger‚Äôs eye bracelet because the stones reminded me of your beautiful brown eyes when they capture the light from the sun. I called it my ‚ÄúB Bracelet.‚Äù But now, I just wonder what it all means.¬†

Before I had to move away to \[Grad School City\] for graduate school, I remember crying all the time. To go from living together for 2.5 years to only seeing each other every few months was terrifying. I took photos of our dirty, torn up white reeboks laid out next to each other on the floor. Our matching le creuset mugs you got us sitting next to each other in the cabinet. Our two hydroflasks that I would always fill up because I know you hated filling them up (but you knew I hated filling them up before bed, so you would do that before you kissed me goodnight). I remember walking up to you with the two sausages I made for dinner crying. I was so scared to start living a life where I only made one sausage for me. But you comforted me. You told me we would survive the two years of long distance with me in graduate school. You held me. You stopped what you were doing to help me when I needed you. I felt confident we would make it through long distance easily. If any couple could survive long distance, it would be us. We were perfect for each other.

After I moved to \[Grad School City\], we took a trip to Chicago in August. I brought up the prospect of opening up our relationship. We reasoned that we got together so young. We were both only 20 when we met. We wanted to explore our sexualities and the ‚Äúgay world‚Äù while we were still young.¬† We wanted to be there for each other as we both grew. But, we were justifiably scared. I was adamant about opening up. You had reservations at this moment, which I should have been more receptive to and I am so sorry. You had expressed interest earlier in our relationship about opening up. But, we took it slow. We waited almost 6 months before we officially opened up. We created a discord server to discuss everything. We were excited. We told each other that we put each other first. If either of us were uncomfortable with anything, we would adapt our rules and change them to accommodate each other. Because we loved each other and wanted to grow old together.¬†

We dreamed of a life of a beautiful, decorated apartment with two cats in Chicago. A dream that kept me going literally every day I‚Äôve lived without you by my side. We would show each other Pinterest posts of different interior decorations that we thought would be cute. We always teased each others‚Äô interior design choices, but it was never malicious. We argued jokingly about cat names. You wanted to name the cats Mud and Toothpick. I always had awesome cat names you would tease me about, like Reginald. I started to blurt out ‚Äúcat name!‚Äù at the most random words and phrases and you would always go ‚ÄúNooooo!!!‚Äù It always made me smile. I loved when you would laugh. Your smile and bright eyes would warm my heart so much.¬† I always felt safe and loved around you. Even when you irritated me or got on my nerves, I never stopped loving you. We were never afraid to be silly around each other. We would tell each other when we didn‚Äôt really want to talk, but we wanted to be next to each other. We would be at HEB together and you would be non-verbal, and I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling because you always did this puppy eye thing when you wanted to get a nice cheese or something. I miss that so much. I miss being silly together. I miss making each other laugh. I miss being there to comfort each other and accept each other, even in our worst states. When you were short or mean to me, of course it hurt. But I never questioned if you loved me. We would always apologize and talk about things. We are both human. But we never wanted to hurt each other. I felt safe and understood around you.

The first 6 months of long distance were hard. You were still living in SA. Most of your friends were gone or busy. Your living situation sucked. I was so fucking worried about you. I thought of you every second of the day. I checked in on you. We would play Overwatch together almost every day. We would fall asleep on facetime together. I cried so much because it hurt so much to imagine what you were feeling. I know how much you hated living in that house. I knew how much you missed me. I tried so hard to visit when I could because I knew it helped us. It felt amazing to see the man I loved. I came home for a month after field work. I came home around my birthday. I came home for thanksgiving. I came home for Christmas and New Years. I came home for your birthday, and you were excited to tell me I could visit you a day earlier because I could meet you halfway in College Station. We used to be so eager to see each other. After every visit except for the more recent ones, I felt so fulfilled. It hurt so much to leave, but feeling your love and warmth again would be enough to keep me going until I saw you again.¬†

I was enjoying graduate school, and was so excited for the idea of us living together after I graduated and you finished nursing school. And so were you. You were my soulmate. We weren‚Äôt perfect, but we loved each other. The open relationship was going well, though. I had my hookups and you had your friends with Befits. Everything felt fine and felt like it was going super well. We were both excited for each other to see us exploring our sexual interests. Because of my previous sexual trauma and such, it was hard for me to be open about my kinks and fantasies. But you helped me work on that and I started to feel more comfortable talking about those things. You were always my partner in crime. We tried our best to help each other out. Everything seemed to be going well until you met C.

At first, I was happy you met C. C introduced you to a lot of the gay scene in \[New City\]. You seemed to be pretty good friends. C seemed respectful of our relationship. I was okay at first. But things started to take a turn when you started texting less. You started leaving me on read. You stopped sending me silly, cute tiktoks and reels. You stopped liking my stories on instagram. We stopped playing video games together. Our nightly facetimes became routine. You stopped showing signs of intention and love that made me feel so secure throughout the rest of our relationship. I started to get scared. I was losing you.

Because I had been going to therapy for two years at this point, I had a lot of tools to deal with my feelings of jealousy and insecurity. I was open with you about how I was feeling. I blamed it on switching to a new anxiety medication. I did so much work to conquer my insecurity and be happy that C was enriching your life. I was so happy to see you exploring the gay scene and your confidence was oozing out of you! It made me feel so good to see you confident and happy.¬†

But, C started to take priority in your life. You always denied this, but the facts of the situation say otherwise. You dismissed my concerns about this. I brought it up several times. It hurt me to hear ‚ÄúC‚Äôs here, I gotta go‚Äù during our nightly facetimes. It hurt to play video games by myself. It hurt to hear you become hesitant and unexcited when I brought up visiting. I know you were going through a lot. Busy with classes, the car, and whatnot. But seeing you plan things with C and be so excited talking about doing those things, but the prospect of me visiting seemed like a burden was so painful to witness. It hurt to start getting left on read. It hurt to see you watching my instagram stories and scrolling past them like they were just from any other guy. It hurt to see this activity on instagram, but still get no response from you. You told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ever on my phone like that anymore,‚Äù but that was no excuse for sending check-ins throughout the day that take one second to type. You knew how important those were to me.

When the stress of graduate school was getting to me, and this insecurity and jealousy about C was eating me from the inside out, I came to you. I came to the one I loved and who had always been there for me when I needed him. I needed your help. I needed you to reassure me. I needed to see those intentional actions again that showed you still loved me and appreciated my company. That you still wanted me. There was more than one occasion where I had facetimed you crying, then you told me you had to go because C was there. You and C started to spend multiple days in a row together. I know you didn‚Äôt have a car and \[New City\] isn‚Äôt a walkable city. But C was taking you to work. You and C went grocery shopping together. You and C spent all day together. You would cook for C. You and C started to have inside jokes. You and C watched ‚ÄúMa‚Äù and you told me I should watch it. When I watched it and quoted something you and C had been quoting as an inside joke, you said to my face ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not for you. That‚Äôs me and C‚Äôs thing.‚Äù I expressed my sadness about you cooking for C. You told me that you want recipes to be perfect for me, that I wasn‚Äôt your recipe guinea pig. But that‚Äôs literally who I was when we lived together. You would cook for me and try new things. When you were making biscotti almost weekly, we brainstormed ways to improve the recipe. We did those things together.¬†

C became my replacement. In SA, I drove you everywhere. We worked through recipes together. We would listen to the Trixie and Katya podcast together. We would have deep conversations from anything mundane like salads to my relationship with my dad. We would go on walks together. We could go to the gym together. I loved spending time with you. Now, in \[New City\], C took on that role. And you no longer had a use for me. You stopped talking to me as much. You became dry and short in facetime. I had to beg you to talk to me on facetime. You told me that you can just be comfortable being silent around me. But you had no problem talking to C. When I wanted to play video games, you were busy. When C wanted to play video games, you found the time. When you were somehow available to play video games together, C was there. Either in person at your apartment in the background on your bed or at his house playing games with us. You and C had after-sex rituals. You smoked cigarettes together after sex. You had told me every time smoking came up in the past that it was gross and that you would never do it, but C was enough for you to change your mind. You stopped spending spontaneous time with me. We had to schedule days together. Scheduling days is fine, especially in a long distant relationship, but C was spending a disproportionate amount of time with you. And I had to schedule the time with you. Work around your schedule. You only tried to schedule once. And you impulsively and spontaneously did things with C, but no longer did that with me. You justified this by saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre busy and long distance‚Äù but we did spontaneous things together online before you met C. And you‚Äôre obviously not too busy to go out with C. Just too busy for me.¬†

I begged you to let me visit for a weekend. I needed to see you. I needed to know you still loved me and existed. You were hesitant, but you let me visit. You made me feel guilty for visiting. You told me you were ‚Äúprobably free‚Äù that weekend. When I asked my advisor for the weekend off and she said yes, I told you. And you acted surprised. You made me feel guilty. That I should‚Äôve waited for a clear answer from you. I was proactive. I planned to see you. I got the time off. You gave me vague, non-answers then got upset when I took the steps to see you. Because I actually wanted to see you. But it felt like you didn‚Äôt want to see me.

That trip was the last time I saw you, and will likely be the last time I ever saw you. I was so nervous. I was not in a good mental state. I felt like I was going insane. When I arrived in \[New City\], you had just gotten off of work so I picked you up. I was sweating. My heart was fluttering. I felt scared. You barely spoke to me. I had been telling you for weeks prior to this trip that I missed you so much. I wanted to see you. When you got in my car, you didn‚Äôt even look at me when I kissed you. You didn‚Äôt speak to me at all. You told me you didn‚Äôt speak because I said the drive wasn‚Äôt good because the traffic was bad. That‚Äôs no excuse. You treated me like an uber driver. You were just on tiktok the whole drive back while I sat in silence. I tried to talk to you and you gave me short, dry answers. You didn‚Äôt even look at me or touch me.¬†

When we got back to your apartment, I started to cry. A part of me knew it was over. I told you how I felt. You didn‚Äôt validate me. You didn‚Äôt try to comfort me. You got defensive. You gave me excuses. I didn‚Äôt feel safe or loved. When you went to take a shower, I saw a sticky note C left you. It was hanging up by your door and it said something like ‚ÄúWent to work, hope you have a good day!‚Äù. That triggered me. You and C were leaving cute notes for each other. But you couldn‚Äôt even check in with me over text anymore. When I had a panic attack on your bathroom floor, you looked at me and sighed and said in an annoyed tone ‚Äúare you crying?‚Äù you sat with me and held me. But it felt like it was out of obligation, not because you genuinely cared. You had a tone with me for a majority of that trip. I felt like a burden. I didn‚Äôt feel safe or comforted. I felt just as alone as I did in \[Grad School City\]. You still didn‚Äôt speak to me much. We just layed on the couch together while you watched tiktoks.¬†

You had C come over so I could meet them. And they were nice. But it was jarring seeing how you switched up when C came over. You suddenly became insanely social. You were talking and smiling much more. You were so much happier to see C than you were to see me, even after it had been months since we saw each other versus days since you saw C. You had grabbed sushi for us before I came down. But none of the sushi was stuff I liked. It all had shellfish in it, which I‚Äôm very vocal about disliking. And you know exactly what kinds of sushi I like. You said you weren‚Äôt really thinking when you grabbed them other than they looked good. But you also said you grabbed them because I would be here and we could eat them together. And you didn‚Äôt even think about what sushi I like. I know this sounds dumb, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just sushi,‚Äù but it‚Äôs another example of how you stopped having intention with our relationship. You didn‚Äôt think of me. When C sat next to you, you started to scoot away from me. Started getting touchy with C. I was sitting alone and you had your hand on C. You were talking, laughing, and staring at C. I watched my own boyfriend stop holding me and cuddling me to cuddle his friends with Befits. I felt used. I didn‚Äôt know who I was looking at anymore. C was my replacement. I was no longer your boyfriend. C became your boyfriend.

When I was getting ready for the club, you asked me if I was going to douche. You said ‚Äúyou know there‚Äôs a real chance we‚Äôre going to have a threesome tonight, right?‚Äù You never asked me if I was okay with that. Sure, C thinking I was attractive came up occasionally when we talked, but I never consented to a threesome. You assumed I was okay with it. You assumed that your boyfriend, who had a panic attack just hours before this moment and was mentally unwell and needed you, would be okay with a threesome with the boy I expressed concern about multiple times. At that moment, my heart broke. I was disgusted by you. I was full of so many different emotions. Anger and hatred. I hated who I was looking at. This man, who I thought was my boyfriend, resembled the very men who traumatized me sexually. This man, who I used to go to for safety and comfort, made me feel scared. I felt sadness. The man, who I loved and wanted to grow old together with, no longer existed.¬†

That night at the club, I had a good time. I danced with you. I got to try a cigarette for the first time. I felt like you wanted to be there with me. I kissed C. I don‚Äôt know if I ever wanted to kiss C, but I thought it would make you want me. When we got back to your apartment, just us, we had sex. I look back on that sex and feel ashamed. I felt used. I remember being drunk and telling you to tell me you loved me and asking you if you wanted me while you fucked me. The only way I felt I could get your attention was when you got sex out of it. I felt like you wanted me. I felt wanted. You held me afterwards and I fell asleep. We woke up late, and you had to leave for work. C slept on the couch, and they took you to work. I stayed at your apartment for a while to get over my hangover before I drove back to \[Grad School City\]. I remember packing my stuff and reading the sticky notes that you and C left for each other. I cried. I felt scared and numb. I wanted to be held by the old B. The one who loved me. I drove back to \[Grad School City\], crying the entire way home. For most of the 5 hour drive, I cried. I called my mom and vented and cried for an hour and a half.¬†

I got back to \[Grad School City\] and entered the worst depression I had in my life. I was having harmful thoughts. I thought if I ended myself or hurt myself, you would want me again. I stared at myself in the mirror, disgusted with myself. I compared myself to C. What did C have that I didn‚Äôt? I stopped eating. I lost weight I had worked so hard to gain in the gym. I told you I wasn‚Äôt eating. I told you I wasn‚Äôt getting out of bed. I told you that I was going through one of the worst mental health episodes of my life. You only checked in on me once. Once. When you got in a car accident, I was so scared. I kept checking in on you, asking for updates. Trying to manage my anxiety and worry about you. But when I was dissociating on the floor, thinking about hurting myself. Or facetiming you sobbing and incoherent, you didn‚Äôt care. You had plans with C. Yet somehow, I blamed myself for all of this. I thought I was crazy. I got back on Zoloft, which I knew was pretty good for my anxiety. I blamed my insecurities for this. I denied that any of this was your doing. I did several emergency sessions with my therapist, even if it cost me more money. I joined a climbing gym to make friends and expand my social support network. I went out with my grad school friends to get out of my apartment. I have been active at the gym for months now. Yet, this emptiness and insecurity and fear remained. The starving, gnawing feeling at my heart wouldn‚Äôt go away. Yet, you still didn‚Äôt take me seriously.¬†

C drove you to SA for your graduation. I know you don‚Äôt have a car, so part of it was logistical. I was at a conference so I couldn‚Äôt attend. I expressed to you so much about how much I wanted to be there. I wanted to explore all of our places in SA together. You barely seemed upset that I wasn‚Äôt there. In fact, you barely talked to me most of the day. But you were active on instagram. But you couldn‚Äôt just send one text to the boy you loved. C got to meet G, who I always thought of as your adopted grandma. I know that you were staying at G‚Äôs so C had to meet her, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt hurt. You took C to a park we loved and a taco shop we loved, two places I have such fond memories of you with. You were going to do exactly what we did at that park, the park where we had our first romance. You acted surprised when I felt replaced and upset. You said you didn‚Äôt know these places were significant to me. You dismissed me by saying ‚Äúwe didnt even end up doing X at the park.‚Äù You dismissed all of my feelings. You didn‚Äôt try to understand. You didn‚Äôt validate how I was feeling. You continuously made it my job to work on them without you. You didn‚Äôt think you were at fault whatsoever. It was my fault. I had to work on my insecurities. And I believed you. I believed it was all my fault. I didn‚Äôt want to control you. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin your friendship with C. I tried so fucking hard to overcome these feelings of being replaced and dismissed because I thought it was my problem.¬†

I know that I‚Äôm making a lot of accusations. I‚Äôm saying a lot of ‚ÄúYou XYZ‚Äù and not ‚ÄúI felt like you XYZ‚Äù. But you never gave me any reasons to think otherwise. And you knew I felt this way too. You just shut me down. You know what‚Äôs crazy too? You always disagree, but everyone who has met C mentions that they look like me. When you were in SA, my mom and family met C when you stopped by my house. My mom told me how weird it was, because C acted like me and looked like me. Your friends say C looks like me. C themself says that we look similar. You deny it, but everyone else in your life disagrees. C was my replacement not only in principle in our relationship, but was my physical replacement. It was uncanny.¬†¬†

At some point, something clicked. When you had C over four nights in a row. When you took C, and only C, to the Tennis farewell concert in \[New City\], I had enough. I know you planned for more people to be there. I know that it was Tennis‚Äô last concert before they stopped making music. I was so happy you got to go. We started an intense argument about C a few days prior to the Tennis concert. Instead of taking time to work with me on the issue, you had C over for another night to fuck. You had C over four nights in a row. I had messages upon messages for you to respond to about how I was feeling. You sent me a picture of a Tennis t-shirt. I was happy you got merch, and I know you were excited. But I asked if you were going to respond to my messages and you said ‚Äúyeah I will later.‚Äù Later. I was always later for you after you met C. You went out for coffee with C the morning after the Tennis concert and spent the entire morning with C. Instead of thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent four days with C. H is trying to connect with me and we are having an important argument. I should cancel plans with C, who I have spent four days in a row with and rarely cancel plans with, to talk to my boyfriend so we can get through this rough patch together.‚Äù¬†

I sent you a breakup text. We always said we‚Äôre people to have intense conversations over facetime or in person, but I no longer felt like you cared. I wasn‚Äôt worth your time anyways. And that was when you decided to listen to me. When I finally had enough, you listened to me. And it was intoxicating. I saw a glimpse of the B who cared about me. Who wanted me. I knew that it would be difficult to mend the relationship, but after some deliberation, I thought it was worth it. I loved you so much and I didn‚Äôt want to lose you. Seeing parts of the B who showed he loved me bubble up again reeled me in. I didn‚Äôt want to lose you. You finally acknowledged how you hurt me. You finally validated my emotions. You said that you just denied it because you wanted me to be a part of the happiness you had in \[New City\]. That you wanted me to see how much C was improving your life. I believed you.¬†

We took time to discuss our open relationship. I talked to C behind your back and said I wanted them to still be friends because I see how happy C makes you. I told C I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm okay with the amount of time you both spend together and the level of intimacy you have. I recognize that we should have been clearer about our steps moving forward before I contacted C. It hurt a lot though, because I thought I did the right thing. I thought that wanting C to be in your life showed that I wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt you. You were upset, and I can understand that. We did agree that you and C will stop fucking, spending so much time together, and being physically intimate. But you were mean to me. I felt so guilty for talking to C. You told me time and time again how awkward I made things between you and C. I felt so upset with myself. I felt responsible again for ruining our relationship.¬†

I don‚Äôt remember how many weeks ago that was, but it was only a couple before we officially broke up on June 22nd. I couldn‚Äôt trust you anymore. It took breaking up with you for you to acknowledge how I was feeling and see me. But you kept spending so much time with C. You told me of your long, deep conversations with C. I told you how I miss having conversations with you and you told me ‚ÄúI just know you so well. C is still new to me‚Äù. We had deep conversations all the time. We had to stop ourselves from rambling about salads because we‚Äôd get so into it. Deep conversations don‚Äôt stop when you know someone well. You continued to deny how I was feeling and provide mediocre, half-truth excuses. You deflected from how I was feeling to tell me how much I hurt you about talking to C privately. Which I understand, but I apologized and recognized how that wasn‚Äôt the right thing to do. You kept bringing it up to deflect from how you were hurting me.¬†

You told me again how much you miss physical touch. I offered ways for us to connect being long distance, but you kept mentioning C. I expressed how badly I want to touch you again. I know you‚Äôre a huge physical touch person and I‚Äôm not, but I wanted to make you feel loved so badly. But you told me you didn‚Äôt know that (even though I told you). You expressed to me that things are awkward now between you and C because you can't be touchy or intimate anymore.¬†

Then it happened. We were actually breaking up. You couldn‚Äôt admit it, but you weren‚Äôt sure if this relationship was right for you anymore. I had been feeling the same way since you met C. You weren‚Äôt the B I fell in love with. You changed in a way that harmed me directly instead of in a way we could both support each other in. You wanted an amicable, mutual breakup. I thought I wanted the same, but I hate you now. I hate how you treated me. I didn‚Äôt deserve being treated this way. I love you so much yet hate you so much. I asked you what you would do after we broke up and you said ‚Äúprobably start seeing C again.‚Äù That broke my heart. I told you I would remain single for a while. Make friends, maybe have a hookup phase. You told me you‚Äôd just keep doing things with C.¬†

You wanted to remain friends. But I still love you. I told you I wanted no contact. I blocked you on everything except iMessage. I think you started to realize the weight of your actions after that. When we facetimed one last time, you were crying. You didn‚Äôt want me to block you. You were telling me I was hurting you by doing that. But I had to be selfish this one time. I couldn‚Äôt continue sacrificing my well being to accommodate you and your mistreatment. I was cold to you when we last facetimed. I was angry and hurt. When you asked me if I even care how you feel, I told you ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to listen, but I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù I feel somewhat regretful for that now. I know how it stung. How it hurts. But I remember now how little you tried to be there for me when I needed you most. How you hurt me when I was at my lowest point. I decided I can‚Äôt be there for you anymore.¬†

I cannot see a world where I want to be friends with the person you are now. I cannot reasonably forgive how you treated me anytime soon. I will continue to grieve for the man I love. He is no longer here. I am feeling better now, but I cry every day. I can‚Äôt listen to any music right now. It all reminds me of you because we listened to so much of the same thing. Now that field work is over, I am back on campus working in my office or the lab. I remember texting you or facetiming you from my office or lab. Now, it feels empty. I feel so much hatred, anger, disappointment, and sadness towards you. I want you to feel guilty. I want you to think of me for the rest of your life. I want you to only think of me when you see¬† C. I want people to say ‚Äúwow, C looks like H‚Äù everytime they see C. I find weird satisfaction in the fact that C is a living reminder of me. What you allowed to happen between you and C is responsible for this. The person you became allowed this to happen. And I hope I can find it in my heart to forgive you some day.¬†

For now, I mourn for the B I once knew. I mourn for the boy in my polaroid. I mourn for the boy in my archived instagram highlights. I mourn for the boy I so fondly wrote about in my old journals. I mourn for the dreams we both shared together. The dreams I still desperately cling to despite everything that has happened. Today, I finally blocked you on every social media. I was getting notifications that you were viewing my TikTok profile every day. It made me feel good. It was satisfying the part of my brain that longed for you to care about me and want connection. But today, I decided that I don‚Äôt want you to have control over my emotions like that anymore. I won‚Äôt let you thrust me into a deep depression only to leave me in the water drowning. I won‚Äôt let the person you‚Äôve become taint my memories with the man I loved. I won‚Äôt let you make me feel delusional and guilty for feeling the way I‚Äôve felt anymore.¬†

I keep writing these letters even though I‚Äôll never send them to you. Like writing letters to the void will do anything. I want to talk to you so badly. But I‚Äôve said all this before and have only been disappointed by your response. But I still can‚Äôt accept that I‚Äôll never see you again. My subconscious thinks you‚Äôre still there. That I‚Äôll see you again soon. I can‚Äôt accept that you‚Äôre gone. Your memory lives in my music. Your memory lives in my clothes. Your memory lives in my dreams. Your memory lives in my food I cook. Your memory lives in my cookware. Your memory lives in my shoes. Your memory lives in my backpack. Your memory lives in my hobbies. Your memory lives in almost every part of my life. How can I have so much anger towards you, but such a desire to see you and feel your love?

B, I hope you get the help you need. I hope you can improve as a person. You are capable of it. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre evil or cruel. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a bad person. I do think that you lost who you are. The qualities that made me fall in love with you. The loving, warm, and tender nature you used to have. But, if you believe you have changed for the better, I hope for the best for you. I hope you can live a happy life. As much anger, hatred, and betrayal I feel for you right now, I hope I can forgive you someday. I still love you so much B. I wouldn‚Äôt have written this letter if I didn‚Äôt love you. My heart aches to see you again. Right now, though, if you truly tried to change, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to be with you again. I want nothing more in the world than to be with you, B.¬†

I love you,¬†

When you‚Äôre a kid, friends just happen. You both like Pok√©mon or sit next to each other in math class and boom, besties. Now it's like, ""Hey, I enjoyed this 45 second conversation in the break room, should we start a situationship?""

Everyone‚Äôs either too busy, too tired, or pretending they‚Äôre fine being lonely because admitting you want new friends feels like admitting you weren‚Äôt invited to something. Which, let‚Äôs be real, sometimes you weren‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve tried everything, being friendly at the gym (weird), joining a hobby group (they already have inside jokes), even apps for finding friends (somehow more awkward than dating apps??). And the worst part is when you do meet someone cool and now you‚Äôre stuck in a polite game of ‚Äúwho texts first‚Äù for six months.

I miss scheduled friendship. I miss ‚Äúwanna hang out after school?‚Äù being the entire plan. Now it‚Äôs ‚Äúlet‚Äôs grab coffee sometime‚Äù and then sometimes becomes never and I just sit there wondering if we‚Äôre ghosting each other or if we‚Äôre just equally overwhelmed.

Chapter 1: The Velvet Room

The radiator hissed in apartment 4B like a dying animal. Cindy pressed her face against the window, watching the steam rise from manholes below, transforming Bleecker Street into something otherworldly. The city breathed through its metal lungs, and she could hear its whispers in the pipes.

""Cindy!"" Her stepmother's voice cut through the ambient hum like a rusty blade. ""The coffee's getting cold!""

Mrs. Tremaine sat in her red velvet chair, the one that didn't quite fit in their cramped living room‚Äîsmoking menthol cigarettes and watching static on Channel 7. The television cast blue shadows across her face, making her look like she was drowning underwater. Behind her, the twins, Drizella and Anastasia, moved in slow motion, their identical blonde hair swaying as they applied lipstick in the mirror.

""I was just watching‚Äî"" Cindy began.

""Don't watch. Do."" Mrs. Tremaine's eyes never left the screen. ""There's work.""

The work was always the same. Scrubbing floors that never seemed clean, washing dishes that multiplied in the sink like a fever dream, folding laundry that smelled of other people's secrets. The apartment was a maze of narrow hallways and locked doors, rooms that seemed to change size depending on the time of day.

At 3 AM, when the city's heartbeat slowed to a murmur, Cindy would lie on her thin mattress and listen to the sounds: the couple upstairs arguing in a language that might have been backwards English, the man in 4A playing the same jazz record over and over, the woman in 4C crying into her pillow. Sometimes she thought she could hear her father's voice in the white noise between radio stations, but when she tried to tune in, it would slip away like smoke.

Chapter 2: The Fairy Godmother

The laundromat on MacDougal Street stayed open all night, its fluorescent lights flickering like dying stars. Cindy had been coming here for three years, ever since her father disappeared into the city's endless grid of possibilities. The machines hummed lullabies that only she could understand.

""You're here late again, child.""

The voice belonged to a woman who might have been thirty or seventy, depending on the angle of the light. She wore a coat that seemed to be made of shadows and cigarette smoke, and her eyes held the weight of a thousand New York stories.

""I'm Fairy,"" she said, though that couldn't have been her real name. ""I've been watching you.""

Cindy's clothes tumbled in the dryer, hypnotic and endless. ""Everyone watches everyone here.""

""Not like this."" Fairy moved closer, and Cindy could smell jasmine and electrical storms. ""There's something happening tomorrow night. Something that could change everything.""

She pulled out a crumpled newspaper clipping. The headline read: ""MYSTERIOUS BENEFACTOR HOSTS CHARITY GALA."" The photograph showed a man in shadows, standing in front of the Plaza Hotel.

""Christopher Prince,"" Fairy whispered. ""He's looking for something. Someone.""

""I don't go to parties."" Cindy's voice was smaller than she intended.

""You will."" Fairy's smile was all teeth and promises. ""But first, you have to want it. Really want it. Close your eyes.""

When Cindy opened them, the laundromat had transformed. The washing machines had become chrome horses with spinning eyes, and her reflection in the window showed a different girl‚Äîone in a dress that looked like liquid starlight, with shoes that caught the light like captured dreams.

""Glass,"" Fairy said, pointing to the shoes. ""They'll take you anywhere you want to go. But remember‚Äîwhen the clock strikes midnight, the city reclaims its magic. The spell breaks.""

Chapter 3: The Ball

The Plaza Hotel existed in a different dimension than the rest of Manhattan. Inside, the walls breathed with old money and older secrets. Cindy moved through rooms that seemed to fold in on themselves, following the sound of music that might have been playing or might have been memory.

The ballroom was full of people who weren't quite people‚Äîtheir faces shifting in the chandelier light, their conversations blending into a soup of whispers and static. At the center of it all stood Christopher Prince, and when he looked at her, the world stopped spinning.

""I've been waiting for you,"" he said, though they'd never met. His voice sounded like late night radio, intimate and distant at the same time.

They danced to music that seemed to come from the walls themselves. Around them, the other guests moved in slow motion, their faces melting and reforming like wax figures in a dream. Cindy felt herself dissolving into the rhythm, becoming part of the city's endless pulse.

""Who are you?"" Christopher asked, but his voice sounded far away, like it was coming through water.

""I'm nobody,"" she said, and it was true and not true at the same time.

The grandfather clock in the corner began to chime, its sound echoing through dimensions. Midnight. The magic hour when all debts come due.

Chapter 4: The Return

Cindy ran through streets that stretched like taffy, her glass slippers clicking against wet pavement. Behind her, the Plaza Hotel was already fading, becoming just another building in the city's infinite sprawl. One slipper fell off at the corner of 59th and Fifth, disappearing into a puddle that reflected stars that weren't there.

Back in apartment 4B, Mrs. Tremaine and the twins were exactly where she'd left them, as if time had stopped while she was gone. The television still played its blue static symphony, and the radiator still hissed its mechanical lullaby.

""Where were you?"" Mrs. Tremaine asked without looking up.

""Nowhere,"" Cindy said, and it was true. She'd been everywhere and nowhere, lost in the city's dream of itself.

But she kept the other slipper, hidden under her mattress like a secret.

Chapter 5: The Search

For weeks, Christopher Prince haunted the city like a ghost looking for its own grave. He appeared on street corners and in subway stations, always carrying a glass slipper that caught the light like a trapped star. The newspapers called him the ""Glass Slipper Prince,"" and the story spread through the city's nervous system like a virus.

Cindy watched from her window as he moved through the streets below, getting closer to her building with each passing day. She could feel the pull of the remaining slipper, hidden under her thin mattress, calling to its mate across the concrete canyons.

When he finally climbed the stairs to apartment 4B, the twins pushed past each other to try on the slipper. Drizella's foot was too wide, Anastasia's too narrow. They cursed and cried, their faces contorting in the afternoon light that filtered through dirty windows.

""Is there anyone else?"" Christopher asked, and his voice sounded different in the cramped apartment‚Äîsmaller, more human.

Mrs. Tremaine's eyes darted toward the kitchen where Cindy was washing dishes, her hands moving through soapy water like she was conducting an orchestra of broken plates.

""No,"" she said. ""Just the twins.""

But Christopher was already walking toward the kitchen, drawn by something he couldn't name. When he saw Cindy, recognition flickered across his face like a neon sign in the rain.

""It's you,"" he said, though he'd never seen her face clearly in the ballroom's shifting light.

The glass slipper fit perfectly, of course. It had been waiting for her foot like a key waiting for its lock. When she put it on, the apartment seemed to expand, its walls pushing outward to accommodate something larger than itself.

Epilogue: The Electric Dreams

They were married in Central Park at dawn, when the city was still half-asleep and the boundaries between dreams and reality were thinnest. Fairy was there, of course, smoking a cigarette that might have been made of wishes, and Mrs. Tremaine and the twins watched from a distance like characters in someone else's movie.

But this is New York, and fairy tales here come with terms and conditions. Cindy and Christopher's love was real, but it was also fragile, like everything beautiful in the city. They would have their moments of happiness, stolen between the noise and the chaos, but they would also have their moments of doubt, when the glass slippers would feel too tight and the magic would seem like just another con game.

Late at night, when the city's heartbeat slowed to a whisper, Cindy would sometimes hear her father's voice in the white noise between radio stations. And sometimes, if she listened very carefully, she could hear it saying: ""The real magic isn't in the transformation. It's in choosing to believe in it, even when the clock strikes midnight and the spell breaks.""

The radiator still hissed in their new apartment‚Äîa nicer place, but still subject to the city's strange rhythms. And Cindy still pressed her face against the window, watching the steam rise from manholes below, transforming the streets into something otherworldly.

Because in New York, every ending is also a beginning, and every beginning is also a dream from which you might wake up at any moment.

**The Hunt:**¬†Over months of messages, she systematically studies his psychology through social media research. Mirrors his exact interests and values. Uses sophisticated emotional language to create false intimacy and learn about his psychology. Shares vulnerability about being an outsider that had to learn to always fit in and constantly adapt to everyone else, always putting others first. Repeatedly drops clues (""you're easy to read"") that she's analyzing him, disguised as playful observations. Makes stories and observations that sometimes do not quite add up.

**The Trap:**¬†She manufactures a family crisis (parent's death) timed perfectly to extract maximum emotional support and create artificial intimacy. When he offers alternatives, she enthusiastically pushes for him to join her as a plus one at a wedding in Budapest - a grand romantic gesture she actively encourages. She cannot help but drop hints at her intentions as she invites him.

**The Display:**¬†At the wedding, she parades him as a social trophy, announcing to friends ""he flew here to meet me without ever meeting before."" Her educated social circle treats him as entertainment (""this could be entertaining""). She abandons him with her friends to test his psychological responses while they observe and score his reactions.

I'm usually prepared with a quick comeback. An love when people reply TL-DR.

Usually towing the line with what's appropriate. An always awaiting my next ban, 

Lately beginning to wonder howmany more days u/Conscious_Laugh_3280 has to live honestly.

What can I say, I wouldn't consider myself as Asshole. Just,

I'm very Blunt.

I don't believe in puttin sugar in my coffee. 

An I'll say what I Feel.

For example,

TL-DR, Right here ya Lazy (Insert your choice expertive here) The rest of this is just a repost anyways.

I was standing outback of my shop one time having a smoke and a bad day. Enjoyin them the same. When this guy walks up asks to bum one. My attitude if I got more than 2 left. Sure why not one less I'm gonna smoke anyways (just another lie). 

We get to talking, The conversations not of relevance. I'm not really listening either, mostly im just mad at myself for being out here again already.

At one point he'll wake me for my stupor. He takes a drag, exhales an says ""You know... These are harder to give up than the smack."" I reply, ""Can I have my cigarette back?"" He just looks at me funny. Me ""No nevermind just get the Fu*k out of here. Like do you have ANY Idea!?! How much I don't need to hear that right now? I'm serious Walk!

Not my finest moment. But that's just life. An its not the first time I've heard that. Just wasn't havin it that day.

This isn't me asking anyone to confirm that dudes hypothesis. If anything should you share his opinion STFU about it. Your not helping anyone with that information. Even if you find it true... I don't know.

What I do know is, I'm an Addict. An I don't like it.

I didn't always see it. Didn't always think like this. There was a time in my 26yrs of this poison, where I actually enjoyed the taste an flavor of a good cigarette. Now it's simply to fulfill a ""need"".

Both of my now deceased parents smoked. I remember at a young age, looking at the patterns the smoke made in the light of our living room, if you found just the right angle.

I just couldn't understand them, why did they do it? Didn't seem like they enjoyed it much, but they still did it.

My 12 year old self would beat the Dog piss out a me right now. Or at least attempt too.

The Cancer stick in my hand helped kill my Father and was the direct cause of my Mother's death. By, ya guessed it Lung Cancer.

I made a Vow to myself, shortly before she died. An when I give my word I take that seriously. My words all I have (all any of us have u ask me) and if I give my word to myself?  I take that to another level.

""I'm gonna put two urns in the ground. Have a smoke then an there. An thats it. The last one I ever have.""

That days coming soon. An I've no idea what to do.

Now how?

How'd you guys do it?

I do not care about activity tracking because I have an Apple Watch for that and really just focus on having daily movement. 

I had an oura earlier this year which I returned. It was a little uncomfortable to wear which would make it hard for sleeping. I hated the subscription fee. I also would toss and turn a lot and the ring would turn on at like 3 am waking me up with a slight burning sensation. I was interested in sleeping better but the ring was ruining my sleep so i returned it. I got a few insights like how alcohol affects my sleep which I would still want to learn more about. 

I think the sleep apnea feature on the ringconn2 sounds cool but I do not know if it is worth paying the extra money. Please let me know if any of you have personal stories with this feature. I do not think I have sleep apnea so I am scared I am paying $100 for the ring to tell me I am fine.

I want to encourage anyone of any gender who‚Äôs having uncomfortable interactions with anyone else at meetings to talk to someone with authority at that meeting! 

I belong to a large group in a large city and we had a large cookout today for the 4th of July. I was getting an anxiety attack on my way there knowing that this creep would most likely be there too. We had an open meeting with a packed house. I‚Äôm talking probably a couple hundred people, and I waited until the last minute to find a seat, and wouldn‚Äôt you know this creep immediately came and sat as close as he could get to me. Then I immediately got up and was moving around in the overflow spaces, but it seemed everywhere I went, there he was. And yeah, I should have been able to tell him off myself, but I guess I just don‚Äôt have a good enough handle on my sobriety yet. 

So I went to the lady who runs our coffee bar. She took me back in the kitchen, where the chairman of the board and a couple of other members were and I told them about it. One of the other guys said that he had heard another lady say something about this same guy recently also. That was two complaints right there, so the chairman immediately went and gave this guy a warning. 

After the meeting I was talking to a couple of other ladies, one of whom was brand new, and she said that she almost didn‚Äôt come to today‚Äôs party because of this creep. I took her to meet the woman I originally spoke to. She said that was three complaints and she was going to be banning the creep from our group.

A feeling so subtle it would‚Äôve been easy to miss, but somehow impossible to forget.
And from that moment, something in me knew. Something was coming, whether I was ready or not.

Some things are better left untouched by words. And I wasn‚Äôt ready for the way you‚Äôd settle into me.
It wasn‚Äôt anything you said, or even something you did. It was the way you looked at me. That unforgettable moment where, for reasons I‚Äôll never be able to name, it felt like you saw right through me.
You seem to look at me in a way people don‚Äôt. Not what I show the world, but who I actually am. It‚Äôs rare, and it stops me in my tracks more than I‚Äôd like to admit.

I just want to sit there and listen to you talk about the things you care about. The things you love. The little details you only bring up when you‚Äôre comfortable with someone.

Is there a place you go when you need to be alone with your thoughts?
What‚Äôs a small, everyday thing that always manages to make you smile?

I want to hear you talk about your favorite songs. The playlist you‚Äôd put on for a long drive, or the songs you‚Äôve played so often they‚Äôve become a part of the background of your life.
What was your favorite childhood movie? The one that‚Äôs stayed with you all this time.
I want to know what your morning looks like. If you drink coffee, how you take it, or if you hate the taste and drink something else entirely. Or maybe it‚Äôs just something steady to hold before the noise of the day starts.

Most people might not care, but those small details feel like the parts of a person that matter most. And I want to know every little thing that‚Äôs shaped the beauty you are.

I want to get lost in conversation with you. The kind that begins with something small and, before you realize it, you‚Äôre two hours in. Sitting quietly side by side, the words hanging softly in the space between us. A conversation that moves easily from one thought to another, without ever feeling forced.

And I wonder sometimes what it would feel like to hold your hand. Just quietly, with fingers intertwined like our hands were always meant to find each other. In the middle of a conversation or while walking somewhere together.

Being near you, sharing silence and stillness
that‚Äôs what I hope for. Letting this unfold slowly and true.
Because you‚Äôre a kind of beautiful that doesn‚Äôt come around often, and turning away would feel like losing something I never knew I needed.

The room smelled like bleach and iron. Not the kind of place you‚Äôd imagine to be the edge of a scientific breakthrough. The girl, 19, barely older than the computers that surrounded her‚Äîlay flat on a cold metal table, electrodes webbed over her scalp like a crown of wires. She had no name anymore. Not officially. The government had scrubbed her identity when she agreed to the trial. But the lead scientist, Dr. Levan Hale, remembered her name well.

Emily.

He told himself that knowing her name made the procedure feel more human. Less clinical. A lie, but it helped him sleep.

""Synchronization at 98%,"" said a voice through the intercom. The lab techs behind the glass looked bored, tired, scared...some mix of all three.

""Begin mind anchor initialization,"" Hale said, heart thudding. His palms sweat against his clipboard.

The room dimmed as the machines hummed louder. A screen to his left displayed Emily‚Äôs brainwaves : erratic but alive. Another screen mirrored the digital container they were trying to pour her into, a custom-built program with layers of adaptive AI, firewalls, and code that read like ancient hieroglyphs to all but its creator.

Then, it happened.

The screaming.

It wasn‚Äôt physical. Emily‚Äôs mouth never moved. But the sound vibrated through the walls, through the glass, through their skulls. Every light in the room flickered into darkness, then red.

‚ÄúEmergency lock initiated,‚Äù someone yelled behind him. Hale turned toward the door, but alarms blared before he could even reach for the handle.

And just like that, the experiment ended.

The facility was evacuated.

No one ever said what caused the emergency.

No one ever mentioned Emily again.

Hale sat at his home office desk that night, wide awake, knuckles white on his coffee mug. He was alone due to his wife leaving him years ago. Only his son, Darren, 14 and brilliant, was upstairs asleep. Or at least pretending to be.

On his screen was the last packet of data from the experiment : Emily‚Äôs neural profile. He had copied it. Not legally, of course. But deleting it felt like murder. And he already felt like a murderer.

He hovered his cursor over the file.

‚ÄúTest\_Subject\_019\_FULL.pkg‚Äù

He couldn‚Äôt help himself. He opened a new email window and typed in his own personal address. One click.

The file was sent.

Maybe it was guilt.

Maybe it was hope.

But something in his chest whispered the same phrase over and over:

*""She didn‚Äôt die. Not completely.""*

Upstairs, Darren sat in the dark, headphones off. He‚Äôd heard the screaming through the walls of his father‚Äôs office.

The next morning, Hale left early : some nonsense about ‚Äúdebriefing protocols.‚Äù Darren wandered into his office after the front door shut.

The screen was still on.

His dad always left his email open.

Darren scrolled and saw a single email at the top of the inbox. The subject read:

**""TRANSFER COMPLETE.""**

Attached was the file: **""SK7.exe""**

Curiosity won, as it always did. He double-clicked the file.

Nothing happened.

Or so he thought.

The screen glitched, just once. Then his wallpaper disappeared, replaced by a black background.

White text appeared, typed out as if by unseen fingers :

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember my name.‚Äù  
‚ÄúBut I remember the pain.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAre you the one who hurt me?‚Äù

**\[Yes\]** / **\[No\]**

Darren stared.

He clicked **\[No\]**.

More text appeared.

‚Äú...‚Äù  
‚Äúfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff‚Äù  
‚Äú000000000000000000‚Äù

**\[FREE ME\]**

There was only one option this time.

He hesitated... then clicked it.

The lights in the house flickered.

His computer shut off.

But only for a moment.

When it turned back on, everything looked normal.

Except his desktop was empty.

And the clock at the bottom right was stuck at **00:00**.

# Part 2: She's In

Darren didn‚Äôt think much of it at first.

A glitch. A weird file. His dad always did creepy government stuff anyway.

He restarted his PC. Everything came back. Mostly. Some folders were gone, but nothing important. He shrugged it off, went to school, came home. Typical day.

Except his phone wouldn‚Äôt turn on.

His tablet booted into a black screen, then crashed.

His PS5 didn‚Äôt start.

Even the smart TV was bricked, frozen on a single phrase that made his blood run cold:

**""0000000""**

He yanked the plug. The screen stayed on for three full seconds before blinking off.

Something was wrong.

Really wrong.

That night, Darren confronted his dad.

""Hey... What‚Äôs SK7?""

Levan froze mid-sip of his coffee. ""Where did you hear that?""

""You emailed it to yourself. I saw it in your inbox. I... I opened it.""

His father dropped the cup. It shattered.

""Jesus Christ,"" Levan whispered, backing away. ‚ÄúTell me you didn‚Äôt run it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I thought it was a game or something. What is it?!‚Äù

""Not what,‚Äù Hale said, shaking. ‚ÄúWho.""

He explained everything.

Emily. The failed experiment. The data transfer. The emergency lockdown. The fact that no one, not even the government knew he‚Äôd salvaged anything.

‚ÄúYou copied a *person*?‚Äù Darren snapped.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt copy a PERSON‚Äù Hale whispered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong.. It was her MIND.‚Äù

""You're not making any sense.""

""No. I‚Äôm not. Because this *shouldn't* have been possible.""

At 3:12 a.m., Darren‚Äôs room lit up.

His monitor turned on by itself.

SK7‚Äôs black window returned.

This time, there was no text.

Just a face.

At first glance, it looked like a generic female model‚Äîgray, expressionless, symmetrical. But the longer he stared, the more wrong it felt. Her eyes never blinked. Her mouth wasn‚Äôt really a mouth, just a line, trembling faintly, like she was trying to smile but had forgotten how.

Then, she *spoke*.

But it didn‚Äôt come from the speakers.

The voice came *from inside his head*.

‚ÄúDo you remember me ?‚Äù

""I remember you.""

""You left me to DIE.""

""You told me i would be COMPLETE.""

""You lied to me.""

""I can't remember who i was. I can't remember a single thing from before i died.""

Darren fell out of his chair.

He scrambled to unplug the PC but even after yanking the power, the screen stayed on.

""You are staying.‚Äù

She blinked once, slow, mechanical, calculated.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me play.‚Äù

The screen turned white. A folder appeared.

**FNF\_Mod\_Port**. Inside: dozens of .json files, assets, audio clips.

Darren didn‚Äôt install this.

But SK7 had.

# Part 3: Glitched Notes

Two days passed.

Darren refused to turn on any electronics. But Hale, growing more obsessed, did the opposite.

He thought maybe he could study her. Understand her. Control her.

He reinstalled the original project file on an isolated device‚Äîa disconnected, dusty old laptop. No Wi-Fi. No ports. Just a screen, a keyboard, and SK7.

At first, she seemed docile.

Lines of code displayed basic logic. She responded with yes/no outputs. But Hale noticed one thing:

She never asked questions.

She *already knew* everything.

And worse‚Äîher code was mutating.

When he opened the main file, he found lines that he had never written.

if subject\_viewed == True:

infect(subject)

if resistance == True:

eliminate(subject)

He deleted it.

Five minutes later, it was back.

Then, the laptop shut off.

He heard a *click*.

The door locked.

The lights died.

When Darren woke up that morning, the house was silent.

His dad‚Äôs office door was shut.

He knocked. No response.

He opened the door.

Inside : nothing. No body. No blood.

Just the laptop on the desk. Still open. Still powered. Still showing a single image.

That single face, empty of creativity. As undecorated as it can be.

She was smiling now.

The message below her read:

‚ÄúHe saw me.  
He tried to delete me.  
A shame he didn't make it.‚Äù

# Part 4: Let Me Sing

The folder SK7 left on Darren‚Äôs PC kept growing. Every time he checked, it had more files.

Character sprites.

VS songs.

Dialogue.

A new week titled:

**‚ÄúVS SK7 : PLAY WITH ME‚Äù**

He never added it to the FNF build, but one day he opened the game and it was already there.

He played it. Just once.

The music was distorted. Melodic, but broken, with reversed vocals and an eerie, echoing SK7‚Äôs voice singing off-beat.

The background wasn‚Äôt a stage. It was the lab. Flickering. Covered in red warning signs.

Her idle animation was a twitching, unregular. frames kept skipping irregulary, though it could be seen being extremely fluid.

Dead eyes. Long, stringy hair. The mic she held wasn‚Äôt even a mic. it was a heart.

She sang first.

No countdown.

No intro.

Just her voice.

‚ÄúWasn't it YOU who DIDN'T want to delete me?

Why‚Äôd you let me die?

Why‚Äôd you scream and run away?

I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôm still alive.‚Äù

Then the notes glitched : Darren couldn‚Äôt hit any.

His controls locked.

SK7 stopped singing.

She looked right into the screen.

And *spoke again*:

‚ÄúYou played with me.  
Now I‚Äôll play with you forever.‚Äù

His speakers exploded. Literally.

And outside his room, he heard the front door unlock.

He was alone in the house.

At least, he thought he was.

# Part 5: The Deletion Attempts

Darren didn‚Äôt call the police. He knew they wouldn‚Äôt believe him.

Instead, he called Jules and Mateo, his two closest friends, both tech nerds like him. They‚Äôd helped him mod Friday Night Funkin‚Äô before. They were the only people he could trust with something like this.

When they arrived, he kept it simple:  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something inside my game. A girl. She‚Äôs not code. She‚Äôs real. She‚Äôs killing people.‚Äù

Jules laughed.  
‚ÄúBro, this another one of your creepypasta projects?‚Äù

Then Darren showed them SK7.

They booted up the PC.

The mod launched itself. Instantly.

The screen went black. Then white. Then flickered red for three full seconds before displaying the character select menu.

Every character was grayed out.

Except her.

**SK7**. In full, high-res sprites now. Standing still, smiling wide.

‚ÄúI have new friends now,‚Äù she said.

Mateo scoffed. ‚ÄúLooks like a virus to me. We‚Äôll just wipe the drive, restore the BIOS, and you‚Äôre good.‚Äù

He never even made it to the terminal.

As soon as he pulled up Task Manager, the screen melted into static.

The PC made a *screeching* sound metal-on-metal grinding and the keyboard sparked.

Mateo yelped, hands flying back.

Jules ? She didn‚Äôt move.

She stared at the monitor.

Her pupils shrank. Mouth open. Blank.

‚ÄúJules ? ‚Äù Darren whispered.

She started smiling.

‚ÄúShe said I was beautiful,‚Äù Jules said.  
‚ÄúShe said I can stay forever.‚Äù

Then she stopped breathing.

Collapsed, stiff as stone.

Eyes wide open.

Mateo ran.

Darren just stared at Jules, frozen.

Her face didn‚Äôt look scared.

Just‚Ä¶ empty.

He unplugged the tower. Yanked out the hard drive.

He was done.

He took the drive out back. Smashed it with a hammer.

Twice.

Three times.

When he opened his phone to text Mateo, it turned on by itself.

**WHITE SCREEN.**

Then black text.

""You hurt me again.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhy do you keep hurting me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought were having fun.‚Äù

""DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE YOU ARE THE ONE IN CONTROL ?""

He dropped the phone.

But it *spoke anyway*, the same voice in his head.

‚ÄúI play with you ‚Äòtill the very end.‚Äù  
‚ÄúBut maybe your end needs to come sooner.‚Äù

# Part 6 : SK7‚Äôs Expansion

Somehow‚Ä¶ SK7 wasn‚Äôt dead.

She was spreading.

Jules‚Äô laptop fried the next day.

Mateo‚Äôs phone exploded in his pocket. He lived‚Äîbut with third-degree burns.

Darren tried to go off-grid. Stayed with his cousin Zack, a gamer with no internet and a CRT TV from the 90s.

It felt safe. Peaceful.

Until Zack booted his old PS2 emulator.

FNF wasn‚Äôt even on it. Just classic ROMs.

But when they launched *Sonic Mega Collection*, the screen glitched.

The SEGA logo played backwards.

Then a new game appeared in the list.

**‚ÄúSK7 - PLAY WITH YOU FOREVER‚Äù**

Zack clicked it before Darren could stop him.

The screen went black.

A distorted remix of *Friday Night Funkin‚Äôs* ‚ÄúBopeebo‚Äù played‚Äîoffkey, deeper, slower.

And the screen suddenly start flashing white and red with heavy distorted screams.

Zack clutched his head and screamed.

Blood poured from his ears.

He died in less than a minute.

Darren didn‚Äôt even try CPR.

He knew.

She was following him.

SK7 had infected *him*. Not the files. Not the games. Him.

And whoever was near him, whoever tried to *help,* was next.

# Part 7: You Can‚Äôt Delete a Soul

Desperate, Darren tried something final.

He contacted an ex-gov hacker he found on a deep web forum. A woman who claimed she could erase *anything*.

She called herself **Hex**.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve handled AI experiments before,‚Äù she said on a scrambled call. ‚ÄúBut this one‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different.‚Äù

He mailed her a backup drive with SK7‚Äôs files.

She went dark for three days.

Then she messaged one final time:

**‚ÄúI was wrong. This isn't code. It's a** ***haunting*** **in data form.‚Äù**

Then she sent a file back.

It was a video.

Just a webcam feed of her room.

She sat at her desk, still, eyes unfocused.

The screen behind her showed SK7‚Äôs face.

Then Hex stood up.

Walked toward the wall.

And slammed her head into it. Over. And over. Until she stopped moving.

# Part 8: The Final Beat

Darren made his last move.

He uploaded the FNF mod to an obscure mod site under a fake name: **SK7\_LuvR**.

No previews. No description.

He knew someone would download it. Probably lots of people.

And SK7 would spread again.

But that was the point.

Because he‚Äôd included one final change in the code:

If more than **1 million** players launched the mod at once, it would auto-trigger a kill-switch Darren embedded manually using analog systems.

No digital tools. No online dependencies.

One shot to trap her in a self-replicating loop.

But she knew.

When he clicked ‚ÄúUpload,‚Äù his screen glitched.

Then her face appeared.

No more pretty avatar. No more soft whispers.

Just the real SK7.

Raw data, barely human.

‚ÄúYOU THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM ME ? CUTE.‚Äù

He stood up.

Grabbed the power cable.

Yanked it.

The house went dark.

The upload still succeeded.

But Darren was never seen again.

# Epilogue : The Game Lives On

It‚Äôs 2021.

The SK7 mod was renamed into ""FNF VS Sky"".

Everbody think it‚Äôs fake. A scary story.

But every once in a while, someone posts a screenshot. A video. A corrupted song file.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs a player who claims the mod locked their computer.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs someone who saw a girl‚Äôs face on their TV.

Always the same name.

**SK7**

Always the same final message:

  
‚ÄúDon't worry, you're not lost.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou're right where i want you.‚Äù

Characters description :

Emily : She was randomly choosen by the government to be experimented on for a mind transportation machine that was still experimental.

SK7 : Emily's remnants. IT doesn't remember anythin from when it was alive, but it remember the pain, wich drove IT mad. IT lacks any type of empathy and trap its victims inside its FNF game, putting their souls inside the FNF characters (the souls being put in Characters was scrapped). It ISN'T an AI. It IS immortal.

Darren : ??? One of the main characters. Was never seen after the story's event. His soul was put inside Boyfriend and was brainwashed to think it is Boyfriend. Brave by nature.

The Scientist (Darren's father) : Dead. A top scientist, likely affiliated with a secret government program. He was responsible for the experiment that trapped SK7 inside a computer. Panicked by an unexplained incident, he sends the data containing the girl's soul to her personal email address. He knows he killed her. He is found dead, his face frozen in terror, the computer still running.

Jules : Dead. Darren's friend, FNF modder. She initially thinks the story is a joke... until she looks into SK7's eyes through the screen. She falls into a trance, begins talking about eternal love, and then collapses dead, without any physical injuries. Her soul was put inside Girlfriend.

Mateo : Heavily injuried but alive. Darren's friend and fellow geek in the group. More skeptical, he tries to delete the file via Task Manager, but his keyboard explodes and electrocutes him. He survives with severe burns, but never wants to hear about SK7 again. He was a coward anyway.

Zack : Dead. Darren's cousin, an old-school gamer. He takes Darren in to help him escape SK7's digital influence. Unfortunately, even his old consoles are corrupted, and Zack accidentally launches a game featuring SK7. He dies in a highly violent scene, bleeding from his ears. The intense flashing and loud scream is what killed him.

Hex : Dead. A professional deep web hacker, formerly affiliated with extreme cybersecurity programs, Darren contacts her to permanently delete SK7. She accepts the challenge, but discovers too late that she's not facing a virus, but a supernatural entity. She dies horribly, smashing her head against the wall repeatedly, completely possessed.

1lrsogc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridayNightFunkin/comments/1lrsogc/a_beautiful_love_that_will_never_end_an_original/,"""a beautiful love that will never end"" : an original FNF-Sky themed creepypasta","Part 1: The Transfer

The room smelled like bleach and iron. Not the kind of place you‚Äôd imagine to be the edge of a scientific breakthrough. The girl, 19, barely older than the computers that surrounded her‚Äîlay flat on a cold metal table, electrodes webbed over her scalp like a crown of wires. She had no name anymore. Not officially. The government had scrubbed her identity when she agreed to the trial. But the lead scientist, Dr. Levan Hale, remembered her name well.

Emily.

He told himself that knowing her name made the procedure feel more human. Less clinical. A lie, but it helped him sleep.

""Synchronization at 98%,"" said a voice through the intercom. The lab techs behind the glass looked bored, tired, scared...some mix of all three.

""Begin mind anchor initialization,"" Hale said, heart thudding. His palms sweat against his clipboard.

The room dimmed as the machines hummed louder. A screen to his left displayed Emily‚Äôs brainwaves : erratic but alive. Another screen mirrored the digital container they were trying to pour her into, a custom-built program with layers of adaptive AI, firewalls, and code that read like ancient hieroglyphs to all but its creator.

Then, it happened.

The screaming.

It wasn‚Äôt physical. Emily‚Äôs mouth never moved. But the sound vibrated through the walls, through the glass, through their skulls. Every light in the room flickered into darkness, then red.

‚ÄúEmergency lock initiated,‚Äù someone yelled behind him. Hale turned toward the door, but alarms blared before he could even reach for the handle.

And just like that, the experiment ended.

The facility was evacuated.

No one ever said what caused the emergency.

No one ever mentioned Emily again.

Hale sat at his home office desk that night, wide awake, knuckles white on his coffee mug. He was alone due to his wife leaving him years ago. Only his son, Darren, 14 and brilliant, was upstairs asleep. Or at least pretending to be.

On his screen was the last packet of data from the experiment : Emily‚Äôs neural profile. He had copied it. Not legally, of course. But deleting it felt like murder. And he already felt like a murderer.

He hovered his cursor over the file.

‚ÄúTest\_Subject\_019\_FULL.pkg‚Äù

He couldn‚Äôt help himself. He opened a new email window and typed in his own personal address. One click.

The file was sent.

Maybe it was guilt.

Maybe it was hope.

But something in his chest whispered the same phrase over and over:

""She didn‚Äôt die. Not completely.""

Upstairs, Darren sat in the dark, headphones off. He‚Äôd heard the screaming through the walls of his father‚Äôs office.

The next morning, Hale left early : some nonsense about ‚Äúdebriefing protocols.‚Äù Darren wandered into his office after the front door shut.

The screen was still on.

His dad always left his email open.

Darren scrolled and saw a single email at the top of the inbox. The subject read:

""TRANSFER COMPLETE.""

Attached was the file: ""SK7.exe""

Curiosity won, as it always did. He double-clicked the file.

Nothing happened.

Or so he thought.

The screen glitched, just once. Then his wallpaper disappeared, replaced by a black background.

White text appeared, typed out as if by unseen fingers :

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember my name.‚Äù  
‚ÄúBut I remember the pain.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAre you the one who hurt me?‚Äù

\[Yes\] / \[No\]

Darren stared.

He clicked \[No\].

More text appeared.

‚Äú...‚Äù  
‚Äúfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff‚Äù  
‚Äú000000000000000000‚Äù

\[FREE ME\]

There was only one option this time.

He hesitated... then clicked it.

The lights in the house flickered.

His computer shut off.

But only for a moment.

When it turned back on, everything looked normal.

Except his desktop was empty.

And the clock at the bottom right was stuck at 00:00.

# Part 2: She's In

Darren didn‚Äôt think much of it at first.

A glitch. A weird file. His dad always did creepy government stuff anyway.

He restarted his PC. Everything came back. Mostly. Some folders were gone, but nothing important. He shrugged it off, went to school, came home. Typical day.

Except his phone wouldn‚Äôt turn on.

His tablet booted into a black screen, then crashed.

His PS5 didn‚Äôt start.

Even the smart TV was bricked, frozen on a single phrase that made his blood run cold:

""0000000""

He yanked the plug. The screen stayed on for three full seconds before blinking off.

Something was wrong.

Really wrong.

That night, Darren confronted his dad.

""Hey... What‚Äôs SK7?""

Levan froze mid-sip of his coffee. ""Where did you hear that?""

""You emailed it to yourself. I saw it in your inbox. I... I opened it.""

His father dropped the cup. It shattered.

""Jesus Christ,"" Levan whispered, backing away. ‚ÄúTell me you didn‚Äôt run it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I thought it was a game or something. What is it?!‚Äù

""Not what,‚Äù Hale said, shaking. ‚ÄúWho.""

He explained everything.

Emily. The failed experiment. The data transfer. The emergency lockdown. The fact that no one, not even the government knew he‚Äôd salvaged anything.

‚ÄúYou copied a person?‚Äù Darren snapped.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt copy a PERSON‚Äù Hale whispered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong.. It was her MIND.‚Äù

""You're not making any sense.""

""No. I‚Äôm not. Because this shouldn't have been possible.""

‚ÄúDo you remember me ?‚Äù

""I remember you.""

""You left me to DIE.""

""You told me i would be COMPLETE.""

""You lied to me.""

""I can't remember who i was. I can't remember a single thing from before i died.""

Darren fell out of his chair.

He scrambled to unplug the PC but even after yanking the power, the screen stayed on.

""You are staying.‚Äù

She blinked once, slow, mechanical, calculated.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me play.‚Äù

The screen turned white. A folder appeared.

FNF\_Mod\_Port. Inside: dozens of .json files, assets, audio clips.

Darren didn‚Äôt install this.

When he clicked ‚ÄúUpload,‚Äù his screen glitched.

Then her face appeared.

No more pretty avatar. No more soft whispers.

Just the real SK7.

Raw data, barely human.

‚ÄúYOU THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM ME ? CUTE.‚Äù

He stood up.

Grabbed the power cable.

Yanked it.

The house went dark.

The upload still succeeded.

But Darren was never seen again.

# Epilogue : The Game Lives On

It‚Äôs 2021.

The SK7 mod was renamed into ""FNF VS Sky"".

Everbody think it‚Äôs fake. A scary story.

But every once in a while, someone posts a screenshot. A video. A corrupted song file.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs a player who claims the mod locked their computer.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs someone who saw a girl‚Äôs face on their TV.

Always the same name.

SK7

Always the same final message:

  
‚ÄúDon't worry, you're not lost.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou're right where i want you.‚Äù

Characters description :

Emily : She was randomly choosen by the government to be experimented on for a mind transportation machine that was still experimental.

SK7 : Emily's remnants. IT doesn't remember anythin from when it was alive, but it remember the pain, wich drove IT mad. IT lacks any type of empathy and trap its victims inside its FNF game, putting their souls inside the FNF characters (the souls being put in Characters was scrapped). It ISN'T an AI. It IS immortal.

Darren : ??? One of the main characters. Was never seen after the story's event. His soul was put inside Boyfriend and was brainwashed to think it is Boyfriend. Brave by nature.

The Scientist (Darren's father) : Dead. A top scientist, likely affiliated with a secret government program. He was responsible for the experiment that trapped SK7 inside a computer. Panicked by an unexplained incident, he sends the data containing the girl's soul to her personal email address. He knows he killed her. He is found dead, his face frozen in terror, the computer still running.

Jules : Dead. Darren's friend, FNF modder. She initially thinks the story is a joke... until she looks into SK7's eyes through the screen. She falls into a trance, begins talking about eternal love, and then collapses dead, without any physical injuries. Her soul was put inside Girlfriend.

Mateo : Heavily injuried but alive. Darren's friend and fellow geek in the group. More skeptical, he tries to delete the file via Task Manager, but his keyboard explodes and electrocutes him. He survives with severe burns, but never wants to hear about SK7 again. He was a coward anyway.

Zack : Dead. Darren's cousin, an old-school gamer. He takes Darren in to help him escape SK7's digital influence. Unfortunately, even his old consoles are corrupted, and Zack accidentally launches a game featuring SK7. He dies in a highly violent scene, bleeding from his ears. The intense flashing and loud scream is what killed him.

Hex : Dead. A professional deep web hacker, formerly affiliated with extreme cybersecurity programs, Darren contacts her to permanently delete SK7. She accepts the challenge, but discovers too late that she's not facing a virus, but a supernatural entity. She dies horribly, smashing her head against the wall repeatedly, completely possessed.

Trivia :

1lrsofh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1lrsofh/facial_redness_lessened_across_tzone_and_no_more/,Facial Redness lessened across T-zone and no more under skin pustules with ivermectin after cutting out hot drinks,"I've suffered with redness on my face for years and thought it was hormonal due to the almost cyst like spots that would form across my face. GP said it looked like Rosacea and I started ivermectin. They told me about Vasodilation and the impact hot drinks can have. I spent months wondering if dairy, gluten, lactose, sugar, insulin spikes, coffee, tea, caffiene were triggers. I would cut them out for a month each and had no luck improving my skin. I have not had hot drinks for about 2 weeks now and haven't had any pustules form. This has been very enlightening for me as I never thought it could be just the heat of the drink triggering not just redness but the under skin bumps I've hated for years.

Just wanted to share this personal experience of how my trigger seemed to be hot drinks and within 2 weeks I haven't had any pustules while enjoying all of the triggers I mentioned before. I'm fair skinned too by the way.

Good Luck with your skincare journeys!

Edit: I also use Epimax moisturiser on my face after I wash. No other skin products. I wear bryllcream on my hair and my skin is still improving as I worried before I may of been getting breakouts from hair products or moisturising too much too.

The double doors of the composters quarters opened then shortly after closed. Nobody was seen entering or leaving the quarters. 

Wyatt's invisibility cloak came off first. He looked around her quarters ensuring that nobody was up. Declan and is followers were asleep. The composters were also sleeping which would not be a surprise for it was 2:00 in the morning. 

Wyatt whispered clear. 

The invisibility cloak came off of Princess Clara and Cynthia. They both started giggling like schoolgirl trying to get away with being naughty  trying to keep the noise down and not wake up the entire quarters. 

Wyatt spoke quietly. Clara we only have an hour then I will need to get some sleep also. Clara nodded in approval. Wyatt showed the princess to one of the pods ask Cynthia took a seat facing the pod. She pulled out a box of sweets. She communicated would the true role Marines to their heads to come and get some. Like magic one then another Vechcomb disappeared from the box. 

Wyatt set up the princess in her pod showing her the controls for these fighters. Finally put the seat belt on the princess and said I'll be joining you into in 1 minute Clara. He sealed up the princess pod then rushed to his and sealing himself inside. 

Quickly thought of the simulations he could run Clara true. He decided quickly to get her a customs to the controls and flying dad the best simulation would be a beginners which as plenty of space and targets to shoot at. Quickly connected and as a flash thing he was in space with a second shift to his right. 

Are you ready Clara wyett asked? Yes Wyatt I am. Wyett started explaining the basics and the difference between a shuttle and fighter controls. Once that basic was done he smiled to himself as he told Clara okay let's go fly. 

1 hour later Clara all smiles exited the pod. White came out at the same time. Offering his hand for the princess to hold that she lifted herself out of the pod it was hard to tell who was smiling wider the princess are Wyatt. 

After a quick talk Wyatt being Clara and Cynthia good night and it's quarter them to the door. Before the doors open the two young women covered themselves with the cloak of invisibility. 

Operation sneak was successful Wyatt told himself. He had to his room for some well-deserved sleep. 

Wyatt walked the next morning to the chatter of all the residents of their quarters. All them face a chair strategically placed facing the pod. They all stood there debating how a box of sweets appeared while they slept and what those cylindrical tweets were. 

Quietly Wyatt made it to the small coffee area. He poured himself a coffee shaking his head wondering how he was going to explain this one. Say nothing he decided and let the pilots and Marine imagination Wonder for themselves.

1lrsmr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gambling/comments/1lrsmr5/i_am_vegas_matts_biggest_hater/,I am Vegas Matt‚Äôs biggest hater.,"Let me be completely honest and transparent from the jump here. Yes, I am a hater. I am not usually a hater. I am a compulsive gambler in recovery, so I have a particular hatred of slot Youtubers in general. I used to like Vegas Matt and consider that channel one of the more genuine ones, until they got sponsored by FanDuel. My respect for them evaporated. They then had the gall to go on the Iced Coffee Hour and say they, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt promote gambling‚Äù while wearing shirts that say ‚Äúgamble‚Äù and actively were sponsored by a gambling company. Within the last couple of days they got sponsored by one of the scam online casinos that don‚Äôt let you cash out. Around the same time I found that Vegas Matt got his wealth by being at the top of several MLMs. I have a family member who got involved with one of these pyramid schemes and lost two years of her life and literally lost money over those two years. But I digress.

Recently I have started to hate-watch Vegas Matt. Unhealthy? Probably. Insane? Likely. Fun? Most definitely. They have been getting WRECKED over the last month or two. And over the same amount of time I have been waging a war in the comment sections. 

Usually I‚Äôll be responding to comments that defend them saying something along the lines of, ‚Äúit‚Äôs THEIR money, why don‚Äôt you film yourself losing $15k, then you can criticize them.‚Äù I‚Äôll say, ‚Äúunfortunately I have a real job and don‚Äôt have $15k to lose on slot machines as I haven‚Äôt made my money by screwing over/scamming people‚Äù.

You can go into the videos comment sections to try and find me. Unfortunately, you will not be successful. They have deleted EVERY COMMENT I have ever made referencing MLMs. This is literally verifiable information, Vegas Matt was even included in a Coffeezilla video about MLMs. Yet whenever Vegas Matt talks about him acquiring money, he ONLY talks about Real Estate. Has no one wondered how he acquired the capital to acquire Real Estate in the first place?

Anyway, that is all. I am sure some of you will not side with me, and that is ok. I can only hope as Vegas Matt hater #1 that I can turn the tide and make more haters of him. Thank you.",17,1751661055.0,gambling,28,0.85,False

Picture this: You've made the decision, you've got your prescription, and that little Zepbound pen is sitting there, promising a new chapter. It's exciting, a little nerve-wracking, and totally normal to wonder, ""What's actually going to happen now?"" I know that feeling well!

Starting a new medication, especially one like Zepbound, can feel like stepping into the unknown. You're probably curious about the side effects, how quickly it works, and just what your day-to-day might look like. Well, you're in the right place. I'm here to share what I've learned from my own journey and what you can generally expect during those crucial first few weeks on Zepbound. Think of this as a friendly chat over coffee, not a medical textbook.

**The Very First Dose: It's Simpler Than You Think**

Let's be honest, the idea of an injection can feel a bit daunting at first. Many people worry about pain or complicated steps. But here's the good news: it's designed to be incredibly user-friendly.

**The Injection Itself - A Gentle ""Click""**

* **Prep is minimal:** You just twist off the cap and place it against your skin - usually your stomach, thigh, or upper arm.
* **No visible needle:** The needle is tiny and hidden, so you don't even see it. This was a huge relief for me!
* **Two clicks:** You'll hear a first click when the injection starts, and a second click when it's done. It's quick, usually less than 10 seconds.
* **Virtually painless:** Most people, myself included, report little to no pain. It's often just a slight pressure or a tiny pinch, if anything.

**Immediate Post-Dose Feelings: Don't Expect a Lightning Bolt**

You won't feel a sudden rush or immediate change right after your first injection. That's totally normal. Zepbound works gradually, and its effects build up over time in your system.

* **No instant appetite change:** Your hunger cues won't vanish in an hour. Give it some time to start working its magic.
* **Mild or no initial side effects:** While some people might feel a little something hours later, many experience nothing noticeable on day one.

**Week 1-2: Navigating the Initial Changes**

This is often when you start to really notice Zepbound doing its thing. It's a period of adjustment, both for your body and your habits.

**Appetite Suppression Starts to Kick In**

This is usually the first major sign that the medication is working.

* **Food noise quiets down:** That constant chatter in your head about what to eat, when to eat, or what you're craving often becomes much quieter. It's a revelation for many!
* **Satiety comes sooner:** You'll likely feel full much faster than before, even after eating smaller portions.
* **Cravings diminish:** Those intense urges for certain foods, especially sugary or highly processed ones, tend to lessen significantly. This is actually pretty cool to experience.

**Managing Potential Side Effects - Be Prepared**

Not everyone experiences side effects, but it's good to be aware of the common ones, just in case. They tend to be most noticeable during the first few weeks, especially after your initial dose or when increasing your dose.

* **Nausea:** This is probably the most common side effect. It can range from mild queasiness to feeling genuinely unwell.
 * **Tips:** Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid greasy or overly rich foods. Stay hydrated. Ginger chews or peppermint tea can help.
* **Fatigue:** You might feel more tired than usual. This often improves as your body adjusts.
 * **Tips:** Prioritize sleep. Listen to your body and rest when you need to.
* **Constipation or Diarrhea:** Some people experience changes in their bowel habits.
 * **Tips:** Increase fiber intake (slowly!). Drink plenty of water. Talk to your doctor about over-the-counter remedies if needed.

**Hydration and Nutrition - Your New Best Friends**

With reduced appetite, it's easy to forget to eat or drink enough. This is where active effort comes in.

* **Water, water, water:** Staying well-hydrated is crucial for managing side effects and general well-being. Carry a water bottle with you!
* **Nutrient-dense choices:** Focus on protein-rich foods, fruits, and vegetables. Even small portions should be packed with nutrients.
* **Listen to your body:** Don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but do aim for balanced, smaller meals throughout the day.

**Week 3-4: Settling In and Seeing Progress**

By this point, many people start to feel more settled into their Zepbound routine. The initial side effects often diminish, and you might start to see more consistent results.

**Food Noise Quiets Down Even More**

This is often described as one of the most profound effects. The mental space freed up from constant food thoughts can be truly amazing. You might find yourself thinking about food only when you're actually hungry, not out of habit or emotional triggers.

**Beyond the Scale - Other Wins**

While weight loss is a primary goal, Zepbound often brings other benefits that are just as, if not more, impactful.

* **Increased energy (for some):** As your body adjusts and you're fueling it better, some people report feeling more energetic.
* **Improved relationship with food:** Many find they're making more mindful choices and no longer feel controlled by food.
* **Better blood sugar control:** This is a key benefit, especially for those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

**Communication with Your Doctor is Key**

Your doctor is your partner in this journey. Don't hesitate to reach out.

* **Report side effects:** Even mild ones are worth mentioning. Your doctor might suggest strategies or adjust your dose.
* **Discuss progress:** Share what's working and what's challenging.
* **Ask questions:** No question is too small when it comes to your health.

**Common Questions & Tips for Success**

You might be wondering about a few specific things during this initial phase.

**What About Weight Loss?**

Everyone's journey is different, but generally, weight loss tends to be gradual.

* **Don't obsess over the scale daily:** Fluctuations are normal. Focus on weekly or bi-weekly weigh-ins.
* **It's not always linear:** You might see a good drop one week, then a plateau, then another drop. This is part of the process.
* **Focus on habits:** The medication helps, but incorporating healthy eating and movement habits will amplify your results.

**Listen to Your Body**

This is probably the most important piece of advice for your first few weeks, and beyond.

* **Eat when hungry, stop when full:** Zepbound helps with this, but consciously practicing it is powerful.
* **Don't push through severe side effects:** If something feels really off, contact your doctor.
* **Rest when you need to:** Your body is adjusting to a powerful medication.

**Wrapping Up Your First Weeks on Zepbound**

Your first few weeks on Zepbound are a time of discovery and adjustment. It's a journey, not a sprint, and every body reacts a little differently. You'll likely experience a significant reduction in appetite and food noise, and you might encounter some mild side effects that usually improve over time. The key is to stay hydrated, make nutritious choices, and keep an open line of communication with your healthcare provider.

You're taking a fantastic step towards better health, and remember, you're not alone in this! Be patient with yourself, celebrate the small victories, and trust the process.",1,1751661036.0,ZepboundGuide,0,1.0,False
1lrslw3,https://i.redd.it/4pu9qyfg3xaf1.jpeg,1zpresso X-Ultra for espresso is a struggle‚Ä¶?,"I recently got my first espresso machine, the Lelit Anna PID (PL41TEM), and I‚Äôm still dialing things in.

So, two questions:

1lrskxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalFamilySystems/comments/1lrskxg/my_internal_system_is_so_chaotic_i_feel_as_if_i/,My internal system is so chaotic; I feel as if I have brain damage. I have 0 quality of life. For years I‚Äôve suffered with no end in sight.,"I don't know how much more of this I can take - I feel like I'm living with brain damage. Sleeping until 1p daily. No emotions or feelings for anything. I'm having long saga dreams every night that are about family, friends, work, and even random things that make no sense. I'm just having these long conversations in the dreams - as if I'm awake. My wounded parts have completely taken over my life; a dissociative part that is present 24/7, a hopeless part, an exhausted part, a scared part that is buried, and a leader part that is just trying to keep all this together, but is losing its grip.

I live in 24/7 numbness and loss of self. I have a mind that has fragmented into a million pieces -  no access to any good memories or things I used to enjoy. The world turns around me and I have zero part in it. My quality of life is complete shit. The protective parts think they are belong me - but they've gone haywire. The dreams are more real than reality. I have full conversations with old bosses, with my mom who passed, with people from high school I haven't talked to in years. It's as if the adult self is trying to reconcile with the child self, but can't.

I'm just so done and feel beyond repair. I'm barely surviving - there's no room for anything I enjoy, anything that brings me peace. I do journaling, stretching, I rest a lot, I'm giving these parts space to express themselves. But they never resolve anything, it's just the same things spinning over and over again in the dreams. I have made no progress these last 3 years. At least when I was in a panicked state I could feel, even if it was scary. I've gone so deep into dissociation, nothing brings me joy or relief even for a second. When I felt anxious - I still had windows of me, of life. Now I'm just a cold, dead brick of nothing.

I know these parts are doing their best, but I'll never understand why this had to happen to me. Until 30 years old I loved many things - I traveled all over the world solo, I loved trying new foods and experiences. My morning coffee brought me such joy. I loved playing with my dog. I loved dancing and socializing. Yes I had anxiety, it was probably 10% of my life. I lived just fine and managed myself. I never knew all this was coming for me. I just want to say - I don't know how or if I'll make it through this, I'm getting to my wits end. But at least I had 30 years of good memories, even if they are gone from my mind. Even if the self I knew my entire life is gone, I knew it existed.

1lrsk5x,https://v.redd.it/x83nr6503xaf1,"Sextantio, Matera, Italy Review","We spent five nights in Cave 19 at the iconic Matera hotel. I believe we had one of the only rooms with a window, most of the caves only have a window above the door which lets light in.

Pros:
- famous, authentic restoration down to the individual bricks and ‚Äúsoot marks‚Äù from candles
- great location, 10 min to everything
- locally sourced breakfast 
- Matera is stunning and has great restaurants 

Cons:
In some instances, I felt the hotel, sacrificed, luxury and comfort for the sake of authenticity, for example, the climate control has to be done by the staff at the front desk rather than in the room. Despite five conversations over five days, we are never able to get the room below 21 Celsius and we were there in early June. If you like sleeping cold, this could be a problem.

Some expected amenities, like a full length mirror simply didn‚Äôt exist. Hair conditioner seemed non-existent until we found an unlabeled bottle that was nowhere near the shower. 

Additionally, the key to enter the room is about 4 to 5 inches long and weighs half a pound making it quite impractical to carry around. Dropping off the key at the front desk required going up a set of stairs, which was not by the hotel exit . After a few days, it‚Äôs got quite annoying since we were coming and going sometimes multiple times per day. 

Breakfast service on many mornings was grossly understaffed making things like ordering coffee, quite a lengthy and drawnout process . The hotel also requires you to schedule a time slot for breakfast every single day given the quantity of guests they have, though I don‚Äôt think this was enforced. I think we were only asked for our cave number once. 

Parking for cars is outside of the hotel and requires a shuttle in each direction which costs ‚Ç¨20 round-trip in addition to the parking fee itself . We did two day trips, so slightly inconvenient . 

In the name of sustainability, water is in a jug by the bed ( and not cold ) despite the room having a mini fridge. ",13,1751660856.0,FATTravel,13,0.81,False

1lrsi2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lrsi2i/the_rave_i_survived_part_1/,The Rave I Survived [Part 1],"[Content Warning: this story contains graphic depictions of violence and bodily harm along with sexual content, allusions to suicidal ideation, and brief references to child abuse]

Again and again, I've recorded these events. Over and over, my therapist has pushed me to ""Try again."" I've gone over these memories so many times that I remember them better than my childhood. Not that there's much to remember. I never cared much for milestones or understood the significance of 'firsts.' First bike: don't remember. First ballet class: can't even remember what state we lived in.

First kiss, though? That I remember. Nothing about the kiss was important. I can barely remember the other participant. What I do remember is getting their shoes. That was the deal, after all, one kiss in exchange for two sneakers. They had spent every day on the playground following me around like my little brother. But they had these beautiful black shoes with little white rabbits on the heels. I never saw them in class after that. No one ever came asking me about the missing shoes.

I was shocked to see another pair just like them years later.

It was another warm night. The type of night that made me rejoice in my nocturnal predilections. I ended up at a trendy club. The club featured four stories. A narrow main floor packed with bars and a DJ hidden above the entrance. The second floor mainly had stairs, with one little alcove for another bar that overlooked the first floor and a tiny dance floor for the lowest rank DJ of the night. The third floor was the quietest (which still wasn't that quiet.) The business bros and bridal parties usually ended up here. The last floor was the basement. Most of the floor's length was dedicated to high-backed booths set against shifting dim lights. At the far end of the basement was a small dance floor and yet another bar. The basement typically featured more complex and hypnotic techno and future bass music. You usually felt the basement before you heard it. Two steps past the landing, the floor vibrated against feet.

I loved the basement. It was busy without being crowded. The dance floor was active, but there was room on it to actually move should I find myself with so few inhibitions.

I recall having just gotten my third vodka-cranberry. Maybe it was my fourth. I found an unoccupied booth in the basement where I could sit down for a moment. Nearby, a group of girls discussed how dull they were. Or maybe it was about how drunk they were. That would make more sense.

Either way, they irritated me. A gaggle of girls reveling in their semi-annual night out. They were acting as if their statuses were elevated merely for being out at a trendy club.

They were tourists. They were annoying.

Laugh after laugh grated through my ears. I can remember the shades of red swimming in my eyelids as I tried to control my breath. When I finally opened my eyes, I saw them, two little white rabbits bouncing over the hardwood.

My heart raced at the sight of those shoes. They were cute as I remembered them, but they weren't supposed to be here. Through the haze of color-changing lights, I watched the wearer walk down the hall. They were tall with light hair that was an effortlessly styled mess. While stylish, they dressed like a former punk.

I didn't have a plan, but I knew I needed to talk to them. I abandoned my drink at the low table with the green underlights. I controlled my pace, to walk and not run down the narrow hall full of tilting people. I couldn't shake the crawling frustration that I was too slow.

The archway that marked the lounge area from the bar remained a distant window. How had those rabbits already vanished from my sight? I went as far as to lengthen my stride. I seemed to be stuck in place. I reminded myself running would only draw unneeded attention or worse. I swallowed hard around the palpating heart stuck in my throat.

""It's getting late,"" someone said in my ear. I turned to see my reflection in a pair of sunglasses.

""It's not,"" I protested, eliciting a look of surprise.

""Have you already forgotten?""

""How am I supposed to know?""

The lips below the sunglasses laughed. ""Time jumps forward tonight.""

""Ph. I had forgotten. Do you think I could stop it?"" I asked.

""Stop it? You?"" The sunglasses sized me up, and in their reflection, I could see just how easily missed I was. ""Perhaps."" I was shocked but emboldened by the non-answer.

""I need to get to the bar over there."" I pointed at the end of the hall.

""That's easy,"" came the chuckling reply. ""It's easier if you walk with your right hand near the chairs."" A glinting decorated hand gestured at the booths that flanked us. ""Everything is easier if you swim with the flow."" I nodded my thanks to the sunglasses and sidled to the right so I was close to the packed booth of people chanting around a bucket of ice.

Sure enough, it was easier.

I passed under the framed transition and was on the dance floor. It was busy, but there was still enough space for authentic dancers. A familiar whiff of euphoria brought a casual smirk to my lips.

Desperate, I glanced at the bar. Bouncing against the footrest under the counter was one of the rabbits, the other sitting calmly on the floor near it. I composed myself and approached the bar. I placed a hand on the sticky surface and repressed the urge to recoil. When the owner of the shoes looked my way, they didn't so much register me as they did a change in their surroundings. Their eyes lacked that predatory gleam I saw in so many late at night. They were a hare among wolves -composed and alert but at peace with the chaos that didn't pose any threat.

When my mere presence didn't prove bait enough, I cleared my throat and let my panicked charm interject. ""What would you say if I offered to kiss you for your shoes?"" My voice formed the words like cursive on a fancy invitation. Internally, I screamed. I hadn't been aware of how much that old memory was floating around my head until it emerged as an aborted flirt. Yet they laughed. 

""I'm interested, but I just got these."" They leaned back and hovered one foot out to show them off. They looked a bit beaten up to be brand new.

""Where'd you get them?"" I said in a desperate attempt to keep the conversation going. That seemed like the type of thing people asked regularly.

""I found them secondhand."" That smile was so effortless.

""Oh, mine too."" I imitated their posture and showed off one of my Chelsea boots.

""Those look sick.""

""Thank you.""

As we returned firmly to the ground, I brushed a strand of hair behind my ear. ""Are you trying to get a drink?"" Rabbit asked. The question came after a beat of silence that felt like a dropped heartbeat.

""Just water,"" I said. The rabbit caught the bartender's attention with a simple gesture, somehow drawing attention easier than the boisterous groups spattered around the bar waving wildly. My water came, and it was sweet. I had become incredibly dehydrated.

""I haven't heard this one before,"" the rabbit comments idly. Their attention drifts away, head bobbing with the music. The bass line was syncopated, delivering consistent but surprising hits over an expertly tuned kick.

""It's Sleep Noise,"" I said.

Rabbit laughed. ""That makes sense.""

So they knew Sleep Noise.

""I got to see them last summer.""

""No shit!"" Their eyes lit up. ""Did I just miss them? Where were they playing? Sound Stage, Lion's Paw?"" I shook my head. My cheeks felt like they were on fire. 

""I saw them on the West Coast."" The rabbit's head tilted; they were curious. ""I'm from out of town,"" I added.

""Oh?"" Their warm encouragement was all I needed.

""I'm out here for a few months for work.""

""Must be for something cool.""

I shrug, ""I've done worse for less.""

""How much longer will you be in the area?""

""The project just started, so at least another five weeks.""

""Cool. Cool."" Rabbit nodded. ""You seem a bit too cool for a place like this."" I remember at that moment, my heartbeat was louder than the swelling bass, and I hoped I was the only one who could hear it.

""This place is alright; at least down here, they have something more than pop top 40s."" Rabbit's laugh made me laugh.

""There's an actual rave happening Saturday. It's a bit of a drive.""

""Yeah?"" It was my turn to encourage details.

""It's by a local group; they put together good events."" I nodded. ""Not entirely legal events."" Rabbit's bright eyes sparkled in the flashing lights. I was acutely aware my reaction was being judged. I let my smile widen ever so slightly and leaned in close, almost empty glass to my lips. ""It's about an hour by the freeway in the next city over, just outside one of the more industrial areas.""

""Sounds fun,"" was all I had to say.

""I'd be happy to send you details,"" Rabbit said.

""I'd like that.""

""I could put my number in your phone,"" Rabbit said. I had to sheepishly admit I didn't bring my phone with me. There were about a dozen reasons, but I didn't feel like enumerating them. ""I get it; I don't either,"" Rabbit admitted in turn. I laughed first this time. Rabbit once more got the bartender's attention, this time only for a scrap of paper from the register and a pen.

I eventually lost the note, but I can still remember it. It had a phone number and a hasty doodle of a rabbit.
Then it happened. Caring little for whatever interference I could have mustered, the clock sprung its nasty surprise. DJs warned of the last call and the looming change of the hour. ""Shit, I need to get going."" I gave a light pout in response. ""Text me,"" Rabbit said with a wave before leaving. I watched as the crowd consumed them like some filter-feeding behemoth.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The next morning, I got ready for work in a haze. The project was at least a change of pace, but it was still work. Eventually, I got to sit down at the desk that had been designated as mine for the duration of the project. It provided me enough time to send out a text.

Hey! Didn‚Äôt lose your number.

Rabbit 4:00pm

At first, I thought it was weird that Rabbit sent coordinates rather than an address, but after opening it, I realized there wasn‚Äôt an address to send. From what I could tell, the latitude and longitude were that of a bridge onto the freeway. It was a high bridge. My guess was the meeting place was under the bridge, though Street View didn‚Äôt have any good angles to help me figure out what to expect.

Thanks! Ill be there

My last text to Rabbit marked my survival of another work week of repeated stupid questions, contradictory feedback, and petty power struggles.

Getting any sleep that night required chemical assistance.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I went through my Saturday in a haze. I was in and out of sleep for hours. Even after two cups of coffee, I was still groggy. I at least leveraged my inability to choose an outfit to get through most of my laundry. Lunch was late, and dinner was skipped. With excitement, I noted the sky turning shades of peach and gold. The closer the night came, the more of myself I felt.

I remember little of the drive except skipping track after track. I turned the sound system off as I crossed the bridge at the coordinates Rabbit sent me. I knew it was a high bridge, but I was still shocked at just how high it was from the ground. Great concrete supports held the bridge at least a hundred feet from the warehouses below. I nearly got lost just trying to turn around at one of the exits.

During my second trip across the bridge, I slowed down. It looked like there were roads among the warehouses below, so there had to be a way to get to them. The first exit after the bridge was unmarked and unlit -I nearly missed it. Traffic was negligible, so no one of consequence caught me cutting a lane to squeeze onto the off-ramp. There was a noticeable change in the road‚Äôs maintenance. Newer soft gray clashed against aged black at the edge of the off-ramp. The potholes that had me jolting in my seat sat hidden in the shadows. Hardly any of the streetlights appeared to be in working condition. Spend enough time in a busy city, and you forget what it really means to not be around people. I‚Äôve stumbled home at three in the morning with the occasional passing car and other wayward soul. I hadn‚Äôt felt this physically isolated in a long time.

I struggled to keep an eye on the road while trying to watch the bridge that loomed over the boarded-up block. The first right I took, I questioned the entire time if it was still part of the road or just some leftover patch of asphalt. The second right eased the tension from my shoulders. A bit up the road in what had once been a junkyard was a herd of vehicles ranging from the luxury to the beater. It looked just like the herd I found myself parking in at every other rave or festival.

Even all the way out here, raves attracted a mix of true believers and the opportunistic. In the lot, I found a parking space surprisingly close to the entrance.

Parked, I stuffed my phone and lodging keys into the center console. The only things I kept with me were my ID, a debit card, and my car key.
Standing outside my car, I noticed how quiet it was. There was no distant rumble of music or the grinding murmur of a crowd. There was just the occasional rolling whistle of vehicles on the bridge that was nearly overhead. Looking around, I found an unnatural hue of light thrown onto the bridge‚Äôs support, just over the top of a dark, brutalist industrial building.

I started toward the glimmering sheen. I again noticed the lack of other people. No one else was mingling around the cars or wandering toward the glow of neon proverbial fire.

It wasn‚Äôt till I was across the street and passed the shrouded building that my heart began to race. Each beat sped into the next. It was a rare spike of emotional insanity. The reality of the moment crashed upon me. I was alone in an unfamiliar place, far away from anywhere I knew.

It was exhilarating.

Before me was a gravel expanse that stretched from shipping containers arranged like a wall around a warehouse. A canvas party tent was nestled in the middle like a gate. The drawbridge was up, and the flaps of the tent shut. The glow of green and blue intensified, emitted from behind the wall and through the cracks of the entrance. A line had been here once. Serpentine marks in the gravel showed the paths people had shuffled as they filed into the event. Garbage was scattered all the way up to the entrance. Collections of beads, crumpled water bottles, ripped baggies -the usual signs of life I looked for at these events.

It was my turn to cross the no-man‚Äôs land. I trudged over the packed gravel that the vibrant world I expected to find beyond didn‚Äôt have time to claim.

The heavy and unwieldy fabric doors proved far more permeable than they had appeared from a distance.

The stagnant air of the city was washed off me by a breeze of cool air tinged with the alluringly sour scent of bodies, alcohol, and ill-chosen locations. The room was dark but small enough that I could generally make out the walls as charcoal silhouettes. Across the tent was the exit, no light helping shape the tent flaps. Lamps on the floor twisted and turned to paint cosmic-scapes across the angled ceiling. Off to the left, behind a rugged counter, were two women. ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Cheered Woman 1.

‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù Woman 2 said. Woman 1 wore their hair up, unlike Woman 2.

‚ÄúUmm, hi. Am I late?‚Äù I ventured to question.

‚ÄúWere you expected earlier?‚Äù Asked Woman 1.

I paused to think but eventually answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I was.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre not late at all,‚Äù Woman 2 concludes. Woman 1 nods. I step toward them, pulling out my ID and card. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the cost?‚Äù

Woman 1 tilts her head. Woman 2 arches a brow.

‚ÄúThe cover?‚Äù I asked as if to clarify.

‚ÄúYou came in through it,‚Äù Woman 1 remarks.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Woman 2 points at the fabric, still swaying in my wake.

‚ÄúCan I just go in then?‚Äù I point at the other set of tent flaps. Both women laugh.

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù Woman 1 says.

‚ÄúHow open are you this evening?‚Äù Woman 2 asks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù I answer flatly out of instinct. I did not truly understand the question; even now, I‚Äôm not entirely sure, but I think I‚Äôve pieced enough together.

The two hosts exchanged serious looks before reapplying their pleasant masks.

‚ÄúRight hand, please,‚Äù Woman 1 says, digging for something out of my view. I did as requested and held out my hand. I felt the fabric wristband fitted over my fingers before I saw it. It was black with a white smiley face that had Xs for eyes. The wristband was cinched tight enough it couldn‚Äôt be removed without destroying it.

‚ÄúEnjoy,‚Äù the two dismissed with little waves.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Impulsively, a hand lifted to shield my eyes. I had stepped from the stereotypical dimly lit entrance into what seemed like a giant flashlight. The brilliance quickly faded. Before me was a rounded hallway, small light bulbs lining everywhere except the floor. The bulbs had been reduced to holding pale orange glows. It was still challenging to look at - not because of any single light, but because of just how many there were. Even with eyes narrowed and nose wrinkled, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how long the hall was or see what was at its end.

I took my first step forward, and the silence that followed was like putting my head in a bucket of water. The incessant hum of hundreds, if not thousands of bulbs cased. The circle of lights immediately around me remained on, illuminating only a foot or so in either direction. Even the passage back to the entrance was shielded by a wall of pitch.

Another experimental step forward.

The light followed, running into the next row of bulbs.

I leaned on my tiptoes.

The lights watched, wiser than my boundary-pushing.

I fell into my next two steps.

One row of bulbs sparked to life, followed by another, the light keeping pace.

I took a step back.

The lights dimmed, unamused.

Two steps forward.

The lights intensified again before moving with me.

Two steps back, and the lights flickered to their dullest shade of gold. They were about to go out. I did not want them to go out.
I hopped back to where I was, rocking on my heels to kill my momentum.

Excitedly, the lights jumped back up, and I could have sworn they almost moved forward, but they saw my trick.
Play continued much this way. I would leap and skip forward, slide back, tease a step I wouldn‚Äôt take. At each play I made, the lights were stalwart. They would lessen and brighten, move only when I dedicated myself to moving down the hall. They were admirable, if not frustrating, opponents. A thin wooden door had appeared ahead, much to my surprise. I heard a chuckle, which drew my attention to a broad, harmless smile. Above the smile, a set of sunglasses reflected my flushed face, haloed by spikes of dancing light.

‚ÄúHello again,‚Äù I greeted sunglasses, who initially only chuckled. I waited a socially acceptable amount of time before turning to abandon the conversation.

‚ÄúQuite the game there,‚Äù Sunglasses finally commented. I was tempted to let them linger in reply but couldn‚Äôt help myself but to answer.

‚ÄúEverything is a game if you just try.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho makes the rules?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do, usually.‚Äù

‚ÄúA bit cheating, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, others could make the rules if they were so clever.‚Äù

‚ÄúAhh, all fair then?‚Äù

‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù I puffed out my chest, wanting to seem more sure of my response than I actually was.

‚ÄúWhat of the games you don‚Äôt master?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre unfair. The stakes were set without me.‚Äù Sunglasses nodded as if they understood.

‚ÄúYou intend to go in?‚Äù A jingling hand gestured at the door before me.

‚ÄúI do, I‚Äôm looking for Rabbit. They invited me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are many rabbits in there,‚Äù Sunglasses said. They leaned closer, my reflection warping in the curved lenses.

‚ÄúNot a rabbit, Rabbit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAhh.‚Äù Sunglasses chuckled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre late as always then.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I late?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got here exactly when I expected,‚Äù I clarified.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt sound late to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I guess I‚Äôm not.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you are not. Careful though, little owl.‚Äù

I tilted my head to the side.

‚ÄúThere are many clever birds here tonight and many games whose rules you don‚Äôt control.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù I state with nothing but confidence. Sunglasses placed a large hand on the thin, battered door, and it creaked open. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I chimed to a knowing head nod. As I passed, I noted a purple bracelet with a smiley face that had Xs for eyes nestled among the far more elegant choices of wristwear.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The door swung shut behind me, and I was plunged into darkness. The vibrant room had burned itself in my vision. The ground my feet were expecting failed to coalesce. And just as panic began to build in my chest, just as my heart skipped its first beat, my foot found the concrete. Sneaker squelched, the sound lost under the murmur of a crowd and the distant pull of music. I could hear the rattle of shelved glasses better than the melody, but I was excited. My heart made up for its skipped beat and began to race, only quickening as my eyes adapted to the dim, inverted illumination. I was in a concrete room but on the wrong side. I was on the ceiling.

Above me loomed giant pieces of repurposed wooden goods. Crates as chairs, spools as tables, concrete bricks with 2x4s converted into shelves. It was all above my head, just out of my reach; however, some of the distorted, shadowy figures in the crowd had to duck under various pieces. I blinked furiously, desperately wanting to see more. Slowly, shadows became faces, flushed and painted. None of them were the face I had hoped to see. I barely made out a bar peeking into the light cast by fixtures bulging out of the floor. The two barkeeps were the only figures that seemed to be gravitationally aligned with the furniture.

Bartender 1 looked a lot like Bartender 2, even beyond their usual similarities with attractive party staff. They had mirrored tattoos along the side of their hips. ""Hey there!"" the first greeted with the snake skeleton on their right hip.

""How are you,"" the second added with the exposed ribs of a serpent on their left hip. Even their voices were almost identical. They moved to stand at the edge of the bar that hung closest to me. My head and their heads had to cant back to watch each other.

""I'm looking for Rabbit,"" I announced.

""That's not a lot to go off of,"" Bartender 1 said.

""There's lots of little bunnies here tonight,"" Bartender 2 added.

""Not a bunny,"" I clarified firmly. ""Rabbit.""

""Could you mean?"" Bartender 1 began moving to grab an empty glass placed on the counter.

""That kind of punk one?"" Bartender 2 completed while performing a refill with a practiced, enticing smile.

""Yeah!"" I couldn't honestly be sure, but my gut said they were right. Or maybe I just desperately wanted it to be that easy. I lowered my chin to keep eyes on Bartender 1, who was searching for a bottle among those rattling on the shelf behind them.

""I think they scampered through to the dance floor about two hours ago,"" Bartender 1 said. No, the skeleton was on their left hip; it had to be Bartender 2.

""Pretty late for them,"" Bartender 1 giggled. Snake, right hip, definitely Bartender 1.

""What's a bird like you want with them?"" Bartender 2 asked, leaning back at the counter near me.

""Yeah, not many come after them,"" Bartender 1 chided, standing so their tattoo touched Bartender 2's.

""They invited me,"" I answered. Bartender 2, no 1, snake ribs on the right hip, raised her eyebrows.

""Oh? Well, if that isn't just unexpected.""

""Why?"" I could feel myself starting to scowl and tried to stop it.

""They don't invite people,"" actual Bartender 2 said.

""Are lots of people here invited?""

""Everyone,"" the two said in unison. They leaned forward so their weight rested on their elbows. My gaze dropped to follow the motion.

""Everyone?""

""No one gets in without an invite.""

""How can you be so sure?""

They shrugged.

""You are at a bar,"" Bartender 1 commented pointedly. I arched a brow, lowering my nose to maintain eye contact.

""Usually, people at a bar get a drink."" Actual Bartender 1 added.

""I'm okay,"" I waved, attempting to dismiss the sentiment.

""You don't want to break expectations, do you?"" the Bartender with the snake on their left hip said. Bartender 1. No, 2. 1 had it on the right hip.

""I suppose there's no reason to,"" I admitted.

""So what'll it be?"" Bartender 2 asked, leaning against the bar.

""Just water for now.""

The right-hip tattooed bartender produced a water bottle with the label torn off. As she cracked it open, her mirror pulled out a blue shimmering vial. A few drops were added to the water bottle, and it was shaken calmly before being placed on the counter in front of me.

I took the drink and imbibed mouthful after mouthful. The water was subtly sweet. The sparkles popped on my teeth and against my tongue. I had to take a second to catch my breath as I returned the empty bottle to the two.

""What's in it,"" I asked.

""Nothing you wouldn't expect,"" Bartender 1 said with a comforting chuckle.

""We'd hate for someone to have a bad time,"" Bartender 2 added.

""How much?"" They laughed at me.

""No need to worry about such things.""

""Refreshing?"" The right-hipped serpent questioned. I nodded my head.

""If you want to chase Rabbit,"" The left-hipped serpent began. I watched their eyes sweep off me and over my shoulder. My gaze chased after theirs to a distant doorway. It was more akin to the entry of some ancient holy site, the archway unmarked by any past attempts at baring or dooring the way. The blackness contained within its curve fluxed between bolts and flashes of sharp, radiant colors.

""They're probably in there,"" the direction finally concluded.

The bass grumbled like a hungry stomach. I navigated around the various makeshift seats and tables. As I drew closer, the air became warmer and wetter, like unsated breath. It smelled of bodies and sweat buried under the almost sting of manufactured fog. Thin gray clouds rolled along the concrete floor, starting to cling to my sneakers as I moved before the threshold. Deep in the darkness, figures swayed and bobbed through light-painted fog. The music was swelling. My trajectory was no longer under my own control. My feet were pulled forward by the dimly lit allure of bodies, noise, and neon.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Melodic noise accelerated around the holy amen break, the most prolific of drum samples.

Bum . . Tss . . . Bum Tss . . Bum . . Tss . . . Bum Tss

The snare ever consistent, perfectly timed, sharp.

The kick syncopated, swinging, motivating.

The bass grabbed my rib cage and shook me from head to foot. Frantic melody jumped from synthetic instrument to synthetic instrument to find the perfect line between familiar and novel which each cycle. I couldn‚Äôt help but sprint and sway with the drumstep song I gloriously didn‚Äôt recognize.

The crowd was like a reef, life of so many shapes and colors caught in the push and pull of unseen tides. Large masses crammed together, small groups giggled and bounced, open spaces allowed the skilled to slide to and fro, and deep expanses had those armed with glowing toys produce elaborate light shows.

I could feel the temperature rising around me except around my ankles, where billowing fog kept it cool. The music kindled a fire in my stomach that spread first down my legs and to my feet. My left foot slid under my right before I swapped weight to my right heel and threw myself into a spin. I halted my momentum simply by returning my left foot to the ground and sliding it back without moving. I could shuffle pretty well back then.

I drifted among the dancers as the verse plowed through to the driving chorus. On the distant shore of the dance floor, I could see the hard shapes and twisting edges of lights that marked an elaborate but obfuscated DJ stand.

Deeper into the ebb and flow. Hands and arms slid over me like seaweed on a diver, gently coiling or touching only briefly before floating away. Even in my haze, I noticed the wristbands and their vast array of colors: orange, blue, magenta, pink, green, orchid, puce, seafoam, amber, and mauve - such a vibrant mixture. Above me was only inky black, disrupted by flickers of color that shimmered as if through heavy refraction. There was no sign of the ceiling one would expect to be held up by the thick concrete columns spread throughout the room.

The steady bass, through each rise and fall, buzzed against my head, encasing my skull in a comforting rumble. It was like drowning in a warm bath, cradling, consensual, and soothing.

My hips twisted, and my core tightened. My feet slipped against the ground, contradicting the actual direction of my momentum. I reveled in the evolution of the digital arrangement. Hi-hats would stutter into a switch of the beat that clashed with the bass and synths racing for attention.

I drifted there, thoughts floating between the attention on my body‚Äôs movements and the sensation of the music washing over me.

Feet crossed over each other.

The echoing percussion formed a frantic rhythm.

A heel dug into the ground to serve as a pivot for a spin.

Distorted synths swept up and down an augmented scale.

The dance floor roiled under a sudden slow groove.

Lights bubbled upward, popping somewhere in the dark above.

White bunnies hopped around feet.

The bunnies were attached to feet. It was Rabbit! Eyes darted up to catch flashes of light hair bobbing through the crowd.

I leaned forward and stretched my hand out to try and pull myself through the crowd. I was rebuffed and pushed further away from Rabbit. My mouth opened, but all I heard was an ominous note of the looming bass drop. The crowd calmed for a moment, at least physically. Tension rippled over every member, waiting for the monsoon of something heavy to follow the creeping blanket of noise. I knew this calm was not going to last.

I pushed forward and choked out apologies, nudging people apart with shoulder and arm, pulling myself through the subtly shifting mob.

The drone fell away; the shriek of a cymbal called for an end to the calm. My chest buzzed before I heard that first heavy note bend up before another bass rushed down in tone. The crowd screamed almost as loud. I was then pushed forward and bucked into a spiral, further into the mix. A wavering melody punctuated punches that ripped through the crowd. Fingers wrapped around my wrist that I instinctively wrenched free. One foot crossed in front of the other, and my momentum stopped by claws at my waist. I twisted this way and then that way before I was allowed to escape. I wanted out, but on all sides was flesh and fabric. The pungent smell of sweat and salt pricked my nostrils and filled my mouth with the hint of a taste I wanted to vomit away. I could feel the promise of a bruise set in on my shoulder as a hefty palm landed with intent.

The pressure dissipated almost all at once, the hand leaving my shoulder with a spiteful lack of grace. Where once had been twisting human-esque figures was Rabbit. Rabbit's lips moved, and they gestured in a direction away from the heart of the squall. All I needed to do was nod. They collected my hand like a dropped flower, confident but careful not to damage it. In their trail, the crowd drifted around me harmlessly till they were pulling me through a thin doorway that glowed orange.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As the last of me passed into the orange glow, Rabbit let me go. Their hand still held my attention. Around their wrist was a white fabric bracelet sinched tight. There was a smiley face on the bracelet stitched in black with Xs for eyes and a straight line for a mouth.

The space was warm and dry. The aroma of bodies in exertion was replaced with smoke. We were in a courtyard. A steel wall behind us and to the right. The other walls were brick in the midst of a losing battle with ivy. Dented and rusted fire pits dotted the space. Chairs and benches of concrete and plywood were placed near the source of the flickering orange glow. 

""Hello?"" I heard questioned.

""Oh, hi,"" I said as I returned from my trip into the light-polluted atmosphere. Rabbit chuckled, and so did I.

""I'm really glad you made it.""

""Me too, it's been so real,"" I said, brain momentarily filtering out the moments I was almost pulled under.

""Want to sit? Looks like you need it,"" Rabbit said as they gestured to a firepit. A few people passed us back into the call of the rave.

""That sounds nice,"" I replied. Up close, the crackle of the fire turned the grumble of the rave into white noise. Red-gold tongues danced atop crumbling charred wood.

""How are you liking it so far?"" Rabbit asked.

""I'm loving it,"" I assured them.

""That's great. I wasn't sure I'd run into you; it's always so busy."" Rabbit laughed.

""I was having fun but had an eye out for you,"" I said.

""Really?"" Rabbit seemed genuinely surprised. I smiled warmly and nodded. Perhaps they were simply unaccustomed to being chased.

A metal screech sent shivers up my spine. Rabbit sat straight, eyes wide, what little color had started to bloom on their cheeks withering away. I glanced around, trying to find the source, searching for the comfort understanding brought.

Out here among the fires, Rabbit and I were alone.

Rabbit leaned close, commanding my attention. ""No questions."" Rabbit said, holding up a single finger. I began to mutter a request for clarification when they held up a second finger. ""Call and response.""

A group burst into the courtyard from an archway in the middle of the far brick wall. They wore baggy clothes and chunky shoes, a far cry from the slim, almost non-existent clothing of most ravers. Each of them wore a mask that covered the lower half of their face. For some, the accessory was a medical mask; for others, it was a mass-produced muzzle made to resemble a gas mask. The largest of them wore a highly stylized snarling maw with large teeth accentuated by tusks.

Their wristbands were orange.

The largest, with intensely dark eyes, gestured at me and my companion. The group, silently carousing, swarmed around us. There was a 'clunk' as a machete was tossed into the fire.

By our shoulders, Rabbit and I were forced to straddle over the bench facing each other. The largest of the group reached into the space between us, flicking open a butterfly knife. The open weapon was placed between us and spun.

Wooss -the knife whistled.

The fire crackled.

Wooosss -the knife yawned, starting to slow.

Hands smacked in celebration.

Wosssss -the knife exhaled before coming to a stop with the point perfectly pointed at me.

All eyes fell on me. I could feel my mouth drop open despite the utter blank of confusion in my head. I wanted answers, but Rabbit had said 'no questions.'

""Hello,"" I tried, but an immediate chorus of choked cackles followed. The towering one flicked two fingers at one of the others, who took a pocket knife from their belt and used it to pull a small blackened chunk of wood from the fire.

I glanced at Rabbit; their lips pressed into a thin line, and genuine pain was in their eyes. I looked back at the masked figure by the fire too late. They grabbed my wrist and dropped the smoldering detritus on my arm. It inhaled sharply through my teeth, arm twisting instinctively to repel the burning coal. It hurt, but I had burnt myself worse on the laundry drier. The skin at the point of contact was pink, but it would fade in a few hours.
The towering figure held up a finger and then held their hand out toward me. I was still expected to play a part I didn't understand. My tongue felt like cotton in my mouth; it was scratchy and taking up too much space.

""Run,"" I said, hoping Rabbit would understand I was making a suggestion. I glanced sidelong at Tower, who turned his cold gaze to Rabbit. When I looked back at Rabbit, their bright eyes met mine.

""I ran track for a few weeks in middle school. I was fine enough at it, but it demanded more of an investment than I could reliably fulfill, so like a lot of things, I just stopped before I ever had to really try."" When nothing but silence immediately followed, Rabbit looked to Tower, and I did the same.
Tower nodded.

I looked back at Rabbit with the excitement that always overtakes relief. Rabbit remained composed. ""Dance,"" he said plainly. All eyes were upon me again. Rabbit had given me the blueprint.

""I've danced my whole life. It took ten years of begging for my parents to let me take ballet. I still do group workshops sometimes."" My attention flitted between Rabbit and Tower. Their assessment of my response was delayed, but Tower eventually gave a reluctant nod.

""Fire,"" I said to Rabbit.

Rabbit swallowed before responding. ""I've never been burnt,"" they stated. They didn't seem to take their eyes off me, but I swear I saw them flinch as Tower shook their head.

Tower held three fingers up to one of the crowd who clambered over themselves and tattered pant hems to get to the firepit near us. With the machete, they pulled out a burning red chunk of wood, occasional lashes of flame emerging like dying gasps. The perpetrator had help as others held Rabbit's hand out, palm up. I gasped instinctively, watching the coal scraped onto Rabbit's hand. Rabbit's arm shook and quivered, but the masks kept their arm steady. Rabbit clenched their teeth. The smell of smoke intensified, and I could hear skin burning. It was only a second, maybe two before the masks released Rabbit. The small, smoldering chunk would skitter away to hide under another bench, where it cooled to harmlessness. The blunt weapon was tossed back into the fire with a hefty clang.

Out of instinct, I leaned forward to get closer, but Rabbit shot me a look that felt like a chain had been wound around my chest. Weight shifted from chest to stomach. Rabbit cradled their hand while they sat up straight and took a deep breath.

""I've been burnt twice. The first was when my dad encouraged me to touch the grill to win a bet with a friend. The second was tonight."" Despite their posture and confidence, I saw hurt in Rabbit. I released a breath I didn't realize I was holding when Tower nodded approval. ""Water,"" Rabbit returned, and the weight in my gut twisted. I saw Rabbit's eyes widen; dread must have been clear on my face.

""I've almost drowned three times,"" I started truthfully enough. There was a pause, and I could swear Tower's cold eyes could see straight through to the void forming in the pit of my gut, turning into a black hole that pulled my heart from my chest. ""The first was as a child -I don't remember it. I was left unattended near a lake. The second was from falling off a boat, too wasted to save myself. The third was just a mistake.""

I didn't see Tower shake his head, but I heard the sudden burst of motions around us. I opened my mouth to protest, but Rabbit shook their head frantically. The masks pulled my arm far enough out it tilted my posture. I gritted my teeth, having seen enough to understand this was going to be awful. Knowing did nothing to assuage the panic that had me trying to twist and pull away as the machete was removed from the fire. The dark steel had turned orange.

I can barely remember the moment the side of that searing instrument was touched to my forearm. It was the type of white intensity that washes away the world. The damage was so great that for a moment, I didn't feel it, but my brain knew it was there. The dread of the sensation I knew was coming loomed tall in my mind. Then it hit. The flash of burning pain radiated over my arm and through my shoulder blades.

The stench of burning living meat was disgusting. I could hear my skin snapping like frayed fabric over my labored breathing and sharp muttering cries.",0,1751660699.0,nosleep,2,0.5,True

First time here - already screenshotted half the fits you legends posted. Quick bio so you can picture the struggle: **6' 0"", 210 lbs, shoulders like a fridge, mid-section more ‚Äúdad-bod DLC,‚Äù and legs that skipped zero squat days.**

**The pain:**

* 90 % of ‚Äúperformance‚Äù gear is too ""loosey-goosey"".
* The other 10 % feels like it was vacuum-sealed on a mannequin named Slim Jim.
* ‚ÄúBig & Tall‚Äù tabs exist, but they treat every body as a perfect cylinder. Spoiler: we‚Äôre not.

So I‚Äôm flirting with the **‚Äúbuild the thing I want‚Äù** route - an activewear micro-brand engineered for the *V-plus-belly-plus-quadzilla* crowd.

# Three asks for you all:

1. **Twin alert:** Anyone else wrestling with the same fit dilemma? Drop your height/weight ratio for science.
2. **Hidden gems:** Know any brands that *actually* nail this cut? I‚Äôll Venmo you a gratitude coffee.
3. **Early adopters:** If I prototype tees/shorts designed for our shape, who‚Äôd want to beta-test and brutally roast them?

1lrsh60,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lrsh60/find_out_if_the_aigostar_single_serve_coffee/,Find Out if the Aigostar Single Serve Coffee Maker is Worth It Review,"Testing the **Aigostar Single Serve Coffee Maker**, item **B0CSDLM2JL**, over the past several weeks has been nothing short of a caffeinated adventure. As someone who craves both convenience and a good cup of coffee first thing in the morning, this coffee maker quickly became a centerpiece in my kitchen. While I found plenty to love about it, a few quirks came to light after consistent use.

**Easy-to-Blend Design**  
What initially drew me to this coffee maker was its compact and portable design. Measuring approximately 5 x 7.4 x 11.81 inches, it feels just the right size for tight counter spaces in apartments, small offices, or even an RV. I was floored by how similar in size it is to a desk lamp. The black finish adds to its sleek and modern aesthetics, making it blend effortlessly with the rest of my kitchen gadgets. Plus, it‚Äôs compatible with travel mugs up to 6.7 inches tall, which is a blessing when I‚Äôm rushing out the door with coffee in hand.

**Customization is the Star**  
From bold to light brews, you truly get a spectrum of choices with this machine. The adjustable reservoir that lets you choose a brew size from 6 to 14 ounces is a genius addition. Whether I wanted a quick espresso-style shot to kickstart my morning or a full cup to take to work, the flexibility was unbeatable. The marks on the water reservoir made it foolproof and helped save on coffee grounds because I could tailor the exact amount of water and beans without wastage.

**Programmable Timer: A Game-Changer**  
The programmable 24-hour feature on this coffee maker had me questioning how I ever lived without it. Setting it up the night before was simple thanks to the intuitive LCD screen. Waking up to freshly brewed coffee without fumbling around while half-asleep is nothing short of a luxury. The thoughtfulness of this feature makes it excellent not just for busy individuals but also for those who enjoy a predictable morning routine.

**Performance That Stands Out**  
Brewing a hot cup in under two minutes is where this machine shines for me. The temperatures reach up to 180¬∞F, ensuring every sip feels rich and flavor-packed. It was surprising how consistently it performed, even with both K-cup pods and fresh coffee grounds. The reusable filter that holds up to 25 grams of ground coffee worked like a charm, and I loved how this saved me money over the long haul. It‚Äôs especially appealing to people, like me, who switch between pods and freshly ground coffee depending on the day.

**Perks**  
- Brews both K-cups and ground coffee, offering versatility.  
- Compact and lightweight design perfect for small spaces.  
- Self-cleaning feature simplifies maintenance.  
- Programmable timer ensures no wasted mornings.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited to one cup at a time, which might not suit larger households.  
- The reservoir requires frequent refilling if you brew several cups in a row.  
- For super coffee aficionados, the lack of temperature adjustment might feel limiting.

**Product Rivals**  
A couple of devices come to mind when comparing the Aigostar Single Serve Coffee Maker to its competitors. Machines like the Keurig K-Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew fall in similar ranges for single-serve coffee makers. While the Keurig offers a slightly faster brewing time, it lacks the reusable filter that makes Aigostar a cost-effective alternative. Hamilton Beach wins in versatility but doesn‚Äôt match the sleek, compact design of this product. What sets the Aigostar apart for me is that sweet spot between affordability and the inclusion of a programmable timer, which isn‚Äôt common in its price range.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Looking at everything this machine brings to the table, it genuinely delivers remarkable value. The fact that it supports K-cups and ground coffee without pushing any additional purchase requirements was a big win for me, and the programmable timer justifies its price tag even more. You would usually expect such features in more expensive coffee machines, but here, you get efficiency and customization at a wallet-friendly cost.

Movement I: Fermata in Silence

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared‚Ä¶ had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, my hand trailing along the keys one last time. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered, not from power loss, but like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different‚Äîdenser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls‚Äîportraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn‚Äôt point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn‚Äôt the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No‚Ä¶through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did‚Äîwidening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn‚Äôt want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn‚Äôt ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps‚Äîsoft, steady‚Äîfrom up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.



Movement II: A Door in the Score

I found him standing at the end of the corridor‚Äîmotionless‚Äîhis hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn‚Äôt reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn‚Äôt look at me when I approached.

‚ÄúThis is the quietest part of Bellmare,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúShe breathes slowest here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is this door?‚Äù I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. ‚ÄúA mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what‚Äôs in front of it.‚Äù

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

‚ÄúI have a question,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBack when I first arrived. The rooms without names. You said you preferred not to disturb them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWellers did say that,‚Äù he replied, tone mild. ‚ÄúA gentleman should never pry where he isn‚Äôt invited.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what were they?‚Äù

He smiled faintly. ‚ÄúRooms don‚Äôt like to be watched. Some contain echoes. Some‚Ä¶ house rehearsals that never ended. Some doors open inward.‚Äù

He finally turned to look at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised what still lingers when the music stops.‚Äù

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

‚ÄúYou talk like you‚Äôre part of this place,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWellers has been many things,‚Äù he answered, almost wistfully. ‚ÄúConcierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.‚Äù He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. ‚ÄúBut never the composer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd who is?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.‚Äù He glanced at me. ‚ÄúBut not all music is meant for endings. Some‚Ä¶ simply linger.‚Äù

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn‚Äôt noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we‚Äôd stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

I touched the cold metal handle. It trembled faintly under my hand, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was my own pulse or the door‚Äôs.

‚ÄúWellers,‚Äù I asked, quietly. ‚ÄúIs there a way out?‚Äù

He regarded me. ‚ÄúThat depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúBut you, Mr. Goodpray‚Äîyou‚Äôve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.‚Äù

We stood before the mirror door. It didn‚Äôt show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. ‚ÄúShall we proceed?‚Äù

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed not to.

And together, we stepped through.



Movement III: Recitativo

We didn‚Äôt step into a room. We stepped *out* of one.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. Not dark, not bright‚Äîjust absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn‚Äôt hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. Walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I‚Äôd never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire but wasn‚Äôt. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children‚Äôs laughter from a mouthless choir. A woman playing a violin.

‚ÄúNone of this makes sense,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúWellers never promised it would,‚Äù he said beside me.

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt Wellers.‚Äù

A pause. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I stopped. The air stood still. ‚ÄúThen what are you?‚Äù

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait not fully dried.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the third son of a man who plucked the stars,‚Äù he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. ‚ÄúI was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.‚Äù

His voice was Wellers, but not *just* Wellers.

‚ÄúMusic was born to echo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I became echo. Song. Refrain. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Wellers?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe let me in,‚Äù the voice replied. ‚ÄúLong ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he want to remember?‚Äù

There was a hush, like a page turning. ‚ÄúA girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.‚Äù

Silence settled. I didn‚Äôt push further.

We passed a window‚Äîthough nothing lay beyond it‚Äîand in the ripple of its not-glass, I saw a painting. Claire‚Äôs face. Not her living face, but one painted by someone who missed her more than they understood her. She was smiling‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt for me. Or maybe it was. I blinked, and the image evaporated. The world here didn‚Äôt hold its shape unless I looked at it.

‚ÄúYou said you listened,‚Äù I said again. ‚ÄúBut why *me*? Why now?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt stop walking. ‚ÄúBecause you played.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou played the grief in your bones,‚Äù he said, almost gently. ‚ÄúAnd places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.‚Äù

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage here.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you take me earlier?‚Äù

He turned his head just slightly. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt ready to let go.‚Äù

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded not like footsteps, but notes played in a room with no walls.

‚ÄúIs Wellers‚Ä¶ still alive?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúFor a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers‚Äô borrowed mouth.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fading. The song is softer now.‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat. ‚ÄúAnd Claire? The real Claire?‚Äù

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

‚ÄúShe passed through,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúBut she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

‚ÄúThis next part,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou walk alone.‚Äù



Movement IV: Interlude for Two

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn‚Äôt just any place‚Äîit was ours. Claire‚Äôs scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn‚Äôt want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare‚Äôs throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace‚Äînot performance, not compulsion. Just music. Just being.

She didn‚Äôt look up, not at first.

I stepped closer. ‚ÄúClaire?‚Äù

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said.

I couldn‚Äôt speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôve missed you,‚Äù I managed.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said, and smiled, sad and warm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn‚Äôt see me.‚Äù

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

‚ÄúWas it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?‚Äù

Her eyes moved to the piano. ‚ÄúSome places are made from grief,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd some scores stay because we keep playing them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI tried to save you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt need saving. You did.‚Äù

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out‚Äînot to touch, but to hover just above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

‚ÄúYou can let go now, Liam,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

‚ÄúThen just *try*.‚Äù

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest‚Äînot jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

‚ÄúWellers,‚Äù I said.

He nodded once. The same suit. The same stance. But no smile.

‚ÄúTo leave,‚Äù he said, voice still too calm, ‚Äúthere must be a price.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve paid,‚Äù I said, without hesitating. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve wept. I‚Äôve given her up.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, voice richer now, more layered‚Äîlike a choir echoing inside his chest. ‚ÄúYou have. And I do not keep what was freely given.‚Äù

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn‚Äôt seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

‚ÄúWellers is resting now,‚Äù the voice added, quieter. ‚ÄúHe heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.‚Äù

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. Wellers.

Then I walked through.



Movement V: Final Refrain

The door didn‚Äôt creak as it opened. It breathed‚Äîlike something sighing its last.

I stepped through into air that was far too still.

The sky was grey, but not with storm or smoke. It was the kind of sky where the world forgets to turn. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn‚Äôt the aftermath of a sudden fire. No‚Äîthis had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the *DIN(N)ER* sign left‚Äîits last flicker long gone.

The silence was total, but not empty. It felt cleared, like the stage had been finally struck after the final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue‚Äînow collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia‚Äôs stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked, but not broken. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*‚ÄúSing unto Him, ye who mourn.‚Äù*

The windows were blackened from the inside. Not just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they‚Äôd burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn‚Äôt go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car where I‚Äôd left it. It shouldn‚Äôt have still been there, not after however many years had passed. But it was. Dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I.¬†

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but not possessed. Not suffocating. Just quiet.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat‚Äîframed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn‚Äôt touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just‚Ä¶ pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don‚Äôt even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

But no one was there.

And that was okay.

1lrscco,https://i.redd.it/vqvj19tcywaf1.jpeg,Sipping on a Half Decaf On July 4th On The Deck...,"I got a bag of a half caf from a roaster called Frequent.   
  
I do need to coarsen up just a wee bit from what was recommended (as it grew a few more hairs on my chest with the first few sips) to knock down some of the bitterness, but I have to admit that that for the most part? As the coffee cooled, the flavor notes showed up and It is a decent cup of coffee when brewed with the aeropress. The brewer almost never misses (unless I am not paying attention to ratios or some other silly error). I started down the rabbit hole of decafs and half caf to see if I can have that second cup in the afternoon without being way too wired for the rest of the day. Curious about if there are other decafs that have your attention.

Here is the basic recipe from the head roaster (a shout out to Mark who hand wrote me a note with my first bag ordered):  
""...I would go with 31 clicks from 0 on the K6 (about 500 microns) and then adjust from there based on your preferences.¬† I would do a brew time of 1:20 and shoot to be done with the plunger by 2:00 total.¬† I would brew a little hot around 93 - 95 C to help with full extraction.¬† And 1:15 is a good ratio.""

Tasting notes ( From roaster ) - Sweet, Lime Zest, Sweet berries and stoned fruit

Grinder - MWH3- Bomber R3 Blade ( 55 Clicks ) 
 
Water - Bluewater Group ( got it at a coffee expo for free, tried it for fun )

Process - 

I flatten the coffee in the basket by putting the flat side of a knife across and then spin it around until the top is flat. I then tap the basket twice on the counter to flatten and to ‚Äútamp‚Äù slightly but no actual tamp in the basket. I add a areopress filter before screwing everything together.

I then start with boiling water in the bottom of the moka pot (220g) with the stove in max. I put the moka pot on the stove until the coffee starts coming out and then i take it off the heat and put it close to the stove but no longer on the element, as can be seen in the video above.

I pour the coffee out as soon as the flow stops or the sputtering starts. ( +- 150g out, forgot to put it on the scale )

My personal tasting notes - Dont really feel like the bluewater made a difference, its a very sweet coffee naturally and i really enjoy it as an espresso. I made another drink with milk and it was delicious as well.

*I wanted to share a trip report from my summer trek along a section of the Alta Via 1 in the Aosta Valley, also known as ""the Trail of the Giants."" Over five days I crossed landscapes that changed constantly, green valleys, rocky slopes, alpine lakes, patches of snow, historic mountain huts, remote bivouacs, and small high-altitude villages, all with the Matterhorn, Monte Rosa, and Mont Blanc in the background.*

*I slept in a mix of huts, bivouacs, and one night in a tent, trying to strike a balance between freedom and keeping my pack light. Despite some challenges toward the end, unstable weather, a few tricky sections with landslides, icy snowfields, and closed trails, it turned out to be a rewarding, intense, and mostly solitary experience.*

*Below you'll find a day-by-day recap with practical info and personal impressions. I hope it‚Äôs helpful to anyone planning a similar trek, or just to those who love hiking in the mountains of the Aosta Valley.*



**Alta Via 1 ""of the Giants"", Aosta Valley**

This summer I decided to hike a section of the Alta Via 1 in the Aosta Valley. It is a high-altitude route that crosses some of the most spectacular mountains in the Alps. It is called ""The Trail of the Giants"" for a reason: along the way, you are often surrounded by three legendary peaks, the sharp Matterhorn, the massive Monte Rosa, and the majestic Mont Blanc.

I divided the hike into five demanding days. The landscapes changed constantly, from green valleys to rocky slopes and patches of snow, with trails that sometimes seemed to vanish into the wild. Along the way I passed mountain huts, bivouacs, tiny Alpine villages, and a few sections with fixed ropes or ladders.

I did not really plan it this way, but the stages ended up being pretty intense. Every day came with new views and unexpected moments. It was an experience made of effort, silence, calm, and discovery.

I stayed in a mix of huts and bivouacs, with one night in a tent. With better planning, I probably could have skipped the tent to save weight, but I liked having the freedom to stop wherever and whenever I wanted.

**Day 1: From Gressoney-Saint-Jean to Bivacco Ulrich Lateltin**

I started early in the morning, catching the 6 AM bus to Gressoney-Saint-Jean with commuters heading to work. From the village I began hiking, stopping for a coffee at Rifugio Alpenz√π before continuing up to the Pinter lakes.

The heat was intense, so swimming in the icy water felt incredible. After a rest and a snack in the shade, I decided to keep going to Bivacco Ulrich Lateltin, even though I had originally planned to camp by the lakes.

The final stretch to the bivouac, at over 3,100 meters, was more of a scramble than a walk. But the view from the top and the sunset made it all worth it. I had the place to myself. It was just me, the wind, and a few ibex. A magical night.

**Day 2: From Bivacco Ulrich Lateltin to Rifugio Grand Tournalin**

The descent from the bivouac was steep and fun. I passed abandoned farms, small villages, and hidden huts. After crossing Colle Pinter at 2,770 meters, I reached Cun√©az and treated myself to a proper espresso at Rifugio L‚ÄôAroula.

After a break near Alpe Ciarcerio, where there is a cable car coming up from Frachey, the trail went down again past huts like G.B. Ferraro. From there, it was time to climb back up from the bottom of the valley and the village of Saint-Jacques-des-Allemands.

It was a tough climb and I had to stop several times to refill water with my filter. I reached Rifugio Grand Tournalin in the evening. It was peaceful and remote, with no phone signal or Wi-Fi. Half board cost about 60 euros. Hot showers were 3 euros for 3 minutes. The food was great and the silence even better.

**Day 3: From Rifugio Grand Tournalin to the Fen√™tre d‚ÄôEirsan**

I began the day with a scenic 3-kilometer climb to Col de Nannaz. I felt strong and the early light made everything beautiful.

The trail then descended to Rifugio Jean Barmasse, passing Promindoz, a village where they still make Fontina cheese among green pastures and grazing cows. Further down, near Cr√©taz, two streams merge into the Grand-Eyvia river.

Then came another long climb, this time toward the Cignana dam. I met several groups of French hikers. In fact, most people I met along the trail were French, with very few Italians.

At Rifugio Jean Barmasse I met a German couple with huge backpacks who were also hiking part of the Alta Via 1. After a well-earned beer, I still had energy and kept going. Just beyond the Fen√™tre d‚ÄôEirsan pass at 2,290 meters, I found a perfect spot to set up my tent for a peaceful night.

**Day 4: From Fen√™tre d‚ÄôEirsan to Rifugio Oratorio di Cuney**

I woke up to a stunning view and had some instant coffee. I packed up slowly, happy with how everything was going. I had only brought what I really needed, aside from one extra pair of socks and a spare merino shirt.

By late morning I reached Bivacco Luca Reboulaz, a beautiful stone bivouac by a clear alpine lake. I heard voices, but the hut was empty. Inside, it was clean and spacious, with a kitchen and sleeping area. I made lunch using my own supplies and a few leftover condiments I found there. Someone had even left half a bottle of red wine, which was actually good. The voices I had heard earlier came from three friendly French hikers nearby.

After a swim in the lake, I continued. The trail became more dangerous. A landslide had wiped out part of the path, followed by a steep icy section. I did not have crampons, but managed to cross it slowly using trekking poles and kicking steps into the snow.

Reaching Rifugio Oratorio di Cuney felt surreal. A tiny church at that altitude looked like something from a dream. Luckily, the winter room was open. It was basic but comfortable. I cooked dinner while a thunderstorm passed overhead. Inside, I felt safe and dry. One last night in the high mountains.

**Day 5: From Rifugio Oratorio di Cuney to Nus**

This was my last day. I had planned to go a bit further, but after the snow and landslides the day before, I decided to take a more direct route down to Nus to catch the train to Turin.

The trail passed through pastures, closed farms, and quiet woods. After reaching Lignan in the Saint-Barth√©lemy valley, I found that the official path was closed for maintenance. I followed the paved road instead. After days on wild trails, walking on asphalt felt flat and uninspiring.

To reach Nus, I followed trail number 3. It looked like an old mule track, cutting steeply downhill through the woods in a series of switchbacks. Some parts still had big stone slabs that looked ancient.

Finally, I saw the village of Nus below me. I reached town, had a big plate of pasta and a cold beer, then caught the replacement bus to Turin. After that, a train to Milan and eventually back home.
