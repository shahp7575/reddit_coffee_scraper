Bird Friendly coffee is a specific, rigorous type of shade-grown coffee, certified by the Smithsonian, that ensures high standards for bird habitat and is always organic. Fair trade coffee ensures farmers receive fair prices, promotes sustainable farming, and guarantees safe working conditions by adhering to strict certification standards. And buying in bulk using your own containers reduces wasteful packaging. This is one of those rare everyday decisions that quietly improves lives across entire ecosystems, from tropical soils and forests to farming communities and downstream rivers. Coffee is grown in some of the world’s most biologically rich regions, which means how it’s produced matters enormously. When sourced thoughtfully, coffee can shift from being a driver of deforestation, pollution, and poverty to a tool for restoration, resilience, and dignity.

Here are the many benefits created by making the switch:

*1. Protects forest ecosystems and prevents deforestation

Shade-grown coffee is cultivated under a canopy of native trees rather than in sun-exposed monocultures, helping preserve forest structure and prevent land clearing. This maintains habitat continuity, reduces erosion, and keeps carbon stored in living biomass instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.

2. Supports birds, insects, and wildlife

Traditional shade coffee farms can support hundreds of bird species, including migratory birds that rely on these habitats during long journeys. Insects, mammals, and amphibians also benefit from layered vegetation, leaf litter, and intact food webs that disappear in sun-grown plantations.

3. Builds healthier soil and reduces erosion

Organic practices avoid synthetic fertilizers and pesticides that degrade soil biology. Combined with shade trees, they improve soil structure, increase organic matter, enhance water retention, and reduce erosion on steep slopes where coffee is often grown.

4. Protects water quality and downstream rivers

Organic coffee farming reduces chemical runoff into streams and rivers that supply drinking water and irrigation to nearby communities. Shade systems also slow rainfall, allowing water to infiltrate soil rather than carrying sediment and pollutants downstream.

5. Reduces harm to pollinators and beneficial insects

By eliminating toxic agrochemicals, organic shade-grown farms create safer conditions for pollinators and natural pest predators which strengthens ecological balance.

6. Improves farmer health and safety

Avoiding synthetic pesticides protects farm workers and their families from exposure linked to respiratory illness, neurological harm, and long-term health risks. This is a direct human health benefit often overlooked in discussions of sustainability.

7. Provides fairer and more stable income for farmers

Fair-trade standards establish minimum prices and premiums that help farmers weather market volatility, invest in their farms, and meet basic needs. This stability reduces pressure to clear more land or adopt environmentally damaging practices just to survive.

8. Strengthens local communities and worker rights

Fair-trade systems support cooperatives, democratic decision-making, safer working conditions, and community projects such as schools, healthcare access, and clean water infrastructure.

9. Preserves biodiversity hotspots

Many coffee-growing regions overlap with global biodiversity hotspots. Shade-grown, organic coffee helps protect these irreplaceable areas by keeping land in complex, living systems rather than simplified agricultural zones.

10. Reduces climate impact and increases resilience

Shade trees sequester carbon, buffer temperature extremes, and help farms adapt to climate stress such as drought and heat. Diverse systems are more resilient than monocultures as climate conditions become less predictable.

11. Cuts packaging waste when purchased in bulk

Buying beans in bulk using your own containers reduces single-use packaging and transportation emissions. Stored properly, whole beans stay fresh longer, reducing food waste as well.

I'm looking for some friends as I recently cut off my old ones for being too toxic, I'm down for a cup of coffee to listening to music r to even playing chess (I'm kinda of a noob at it but I'm learning)

A few of my hobbies are probably reading, film photography (I have a canon a1) and probably just eating good food, I'm currently trying out some old hobbies like playing the guitar which I stopped because I was too impatient with myself at learning. I'm currently on a weight loss journey so I'm on the heavier side

I'm not looking for a relationship since I'm already in one, I'm open to anyone as long as we can talk about anything and willing to try new things as Mr ota from YiYi said:

""Why are we afraid of the first time? Every day in life is a first time, every morning is new. We never live the same day twice, we never afraid of getting up in every morning, why?""

  With the day just getting started I’m excited for work. Today we receive our weekly mission at my job. I have been groomed into the family business, the perfect child, growing up excelling at everything. But a rebel at heart. When it comes to the job no one is more serious than me.
  These objectives are of upmost importance to my family. Succeeding brings in artifacts, conductors, and money.  Which are used to wage war with another rival in the same line of business.  Our jobs are to locate the main spiritual power source of the house, while locating the enchanted objects and, laying the innocent spirits to rest. Including the lost souls who have evil in its core affecting the living and its surroundings. No longer able to contain my excitement I rush off my bed to grab my work clothes. Black on black is preferred in our line of work. 
 Scrambling  towards the mirror eyeing myself. My long red hair down to my waist, The baby blue in my retinas  are looking as bright as the ocean. “I don’t think I  need any make up today.” With nothing else needing to be done I dash out the door but, not without grabbing my coffee. Racing out to  my car fumbling with the keys in my hand ready for my daily commute. 
  I arrive at work making decent time. I make a habit of never being late walking with a goal in mind towards the building through the entrance doors. That are  of circular motion . I used to love going through these things but now they are an inconvenience to me and my patience is running thin.  My temper is easily flared cursing the slow rotating doors.  Finally out its time  to get in gear , make my way to my floor.  My  destination is on the  second level so I have to make the first right past the receptionist counter to use the elevator. 
  Standing there waiting for the elevator to come down thinking of where I am going to next. Since my job requires a lot of travel. The elevator dings I waste no time  getting in pressing the button to go up.  It only takes a few minutes to reach my target area, as I am stepping out of the elevator the bustling of the mission office is in full force.  Walking by the front desk on the right I continue towards the waiting room.  
  Listening to all the commotion going on  I wait for my task, I over hear the receptionists as they talk their gossip about one of their dates. I couldn’t help but snicker at the conversation. 
  The phones keep ringing thank god I am not a paper pusher. They must have such a boring work day. Then the receptionist on the right gets up and walks back to her printer grabs a report she has just received, continuing to walk behind her desk towards me. She smiles with a grin handing me the paper and says “good luck.” 
  With the receptionist gone I look down at my report. A conductor, artifact, and innocent spirits need to be laid to rest. This doesn’t look to challenging as I let out a sigh of disappointment. “Well, I better get going before I get beheaded.” The secretaries start rolling with laughter. I like cheering them up since they don’t have the greatest work day. 
  I  pace myself  heading towards my car. Which is of no importance it’s just a hooptie that gets me from a to b.              Dreading the car ride to our job I can hear the conversation in my head. Why do I have to pick her up this morning. She is going to give me so much crap today about this assignment . Every Monday it’s the same thing we need a better score this is kids’ stuff. Why don’t you shut up and do your job. You sure as hell don’t listen to me and I am the one in charge. I see her standing there while pulling up beside her . She is the same age as me with a very spunky personality. Her long blonde hair down to her waist, her hazel eyes brighter than ever. She seems extra cheerful today . Looks like there is some pep in her step today hustling towards my car. Maybe it will be different today Before she even gets in the chatter starts. “Please tell me you got a good score this week.” “You act like I make the jobs around here quit your whining.” You always got a stick up your ass Faith you need a man in your life.”  I want to slap her so bad but I can’t help but let the laughter out. 
  Two friends driving to their destinations. Normal looking citizens who are anything but. With night fall approaching the rain begins to fall pounding the roof of the car waking up Faith. “Oh, hey your up” “Looks like you got bed hair there red.” “Will you give me a break  for once.” “Someone has an attitude today. That time of the month noted.” “I swear I hate you so much.” “You know you can’t do anything with out me red, you know you love it.” 
  “Why does it always have to be pouring I swear your family does this to you on purpose. “I know Terra but that’s why I am the genius of the family one day they will know that.” “Let’s get this over with red as she is putting on her  gloves. “Hey pop the trunk we need our tools.” We always keep everything we need In a duffle bag that has my family’s crescent on it. With everything ready it's time to start this job.
 Thunder sounds above unleashing the tsunami the sky was holding. Both of us grabbing our flashlights they are powerful enough to see through this down pour. We can’t immediately run to the home. It’s important to the case the building and get a good view of your surroundings.  
  The gravel driveway is turning into slosh and mud splashing on our shoes every time we take step. “This man was a junk collector Terra.” “I know look at the tractor in the front yard. An old rusty tractor next to it a huge trailer to long for the yard itself.  While eyeing the rest of the yard lighting strikes it’s  core piercing  it’s rusty armor. If that wasn’t a warning sign, I don’t know what was. The crack of god followed the electricity is hair raising. 
  “Look at all the cars over there on the left side Faith” The rain  battering more violently than ever after the sound of heaven. Even with our flashlights its difficult but I can make out the rusty old cars parked beneath the trees. “It’s amazing how much junk one can accumulate in their life time.” “Yea but that’s how I make a living Faith.”
  Turning  my  attention over to the left. I see Terra kneeling down in front of the steps. It’s like she doesn’t even care that were in a middle of a typhoon. She has always had a soft spot for animals. “Look there is so many of them as she is petting the cat.  I rush to  her putting  my hand on her shoulder comforting her the rain not affecting our personalities “I know but there is nothing we can do about it now Terra. “I know let’s get going.” She picks up the feline and puts it under some shelter for the night.   
  This is where Terra’s skills come in handy. We continue to walk up the rotted stairs. With a flimsy aluminum railing not even worth using. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out her wallet, the tools she uses are everyday items but the one she needs now is her credit card.  While pulling out her card she fumbles with her wallet dropping it down the stairs. Ignoring it she turns towards the door to shimmy the top dead bolt lock. “At least the porch light is on.” She is tinkering with lock while the rain is bouncing violently from her face. I can see the concentration on her a rare moment when she is actually serious.   
  After a few moments the door is popped open. “After you boss lady.” I make my way inside as she doubles back to grab her wallet. She slips on the last step landing on her hind quarters.  Without realizing it I let my laughter out uncontrollably. My flashlight providing her light can see the red on her face  she is filled with embarrassment. She gets up and brushes off her  back side collects her belongings now soaking wet. Her wallet in her grasp she walks past me. “Not another word.”  
  Still chuckling I take few steps inside to shake out my shoes and dry off. When all of a sudden, I hear a loud bang behind us.  The door has slammed without a physical force operating it. My partner let’s out a grin of excitement “Looks like someone goofed at hq.” This is our destiny where will it take us, I don’t know. But Terra is right we are in for a much bigger fight than expected.

One room inparticular is warmer than the thermostat detects because the wall it is mounted on is much cooler than the room so the readings are incorrect. We have another dumb thermostat in the room that confirms this. We see 16 on the wall mounted one and 18+ on the dumb one, for example.

We'd like to replace this one with a wireless device that we can place in the middle of the room (say on the coffee table) where it will get a more accurate reading of the room's temperature. We contacted Heatmiser and got very poor responses, but they suggested the **Wireless Thermostat & Receiver - Slimline-RF Bundle v3** which seems to do this but without being ""smart"".

Ideally I want to change for a smarter device that works with Google Home and/or Home Assistant. I have 8 in total in my house and would really like to swap them all (likely one at a time over a longer period).

I’m a 39-year-old man from Norway, and this is the first time in my life I’m writing my full story in one place. I’m posting here in the hope of finding people who might recognize parts of it, or who might have advice or insight. 



I’ve had these symptoms — or whatever this condition is — for as long as I can remember. Since around my early 20s, I’ve spent most of my adult life trying to understand what’s wrong with me. Many times, I’ve felt like I was getting close, finding conditions that seemed to match, but there have been *so many* different possibilities that I’ve never landed on one clear answer. Because of that, I’ve never really received proper help from doctors. I’ve never been on medication. I’m unvaccinated.



Instead, I’ve mostly tried to manage my life in ways that make my daily functioning better — with mixed success.





# Lifestyle background





Up until about age 35, I lived quite unhealthily. I ate a lot of candy and sugar, drank a lot of alcohol, smoked, and generally had a poor diet. Discipline has always been difficult for me. Over the last five years, I’ve managed to quit most of this: no smoking, no alcohol, and a much cleaner diet — except for sugar, which I still struggle with, and one cup of coffee every morning.



I’m sharing this because I want to see if my experience resonates with others.





# Core symptoms





My baseline state has always felt *unstable*.



* I get dizzy easily, especially related to blood sugar.
* I get dizzy when standing up, and often feel mildly dizzy most of the day.
* This is especially noticeable after periods of poor diet.
* Sometimes I feel slightly better after eating, but not always.
* I also experience occasional blurred or “foggy” vision when standing up — much worse in the past when I consumed a lot more sugar.







# Skin issues





I’ve had eczema my whole life, possibly a mix of fungal eczema and psoriasis.



The locations have shifted over the years:



* As a child: outside of the elbows
* Later: behind one knee for several years
* Then it disappeared, returned on the other knee, disappeared again





About 7–8 years ago, the flare-ups moved mainly to the groin and scrotum. 

I also experience generalized itching across my body, especially in warm or sweaty areas (armpits, groin, buttocks). Dry around the eyes. Temperature, sweating, and diet all seem to influence this.





# Neurological & pain-related symptoms





* I’ve had migraines my entire life.
* I believe I have piriformis syndrome: constant pain in my left glute, radiating down my left leg.
* My left side feels weaker overall, including my left hand.
* My left foot and toes are often very cold.
* I’ve had a slightly uneven posture for most of my life.





I also experience:



* Constant inner restlessness, like something is “buzzing” inside me
* Poor concentration — I’ve suspected ADHD but never been evaluated
* Strong tingling/restless sensations in my feet (“runner’s feet”), which improve when I elevate my legs







# Movement & exercise





I’ve always loved walking and running, and I *need* daily movement to function. I struggle to sit still — partly due to restlessness and concentration issues, partly due to nerve pain. Walking or running helps me calm down afterward.



I used to smoke cannabis regularly for nearly 20 years, but I quit five years ago. I’ve found that endurance exercise gives me a similar sense of relief or “high.”



Strength training has always been extremely difficult for me. I become dizzy and exhausted very quickly. I still try, mainly to support my knees, but one knee feels permanently damaged, and I don’t believe it can be fully repaired.





# Food sensitivities





Over the years, I’ve suspected many things:



* Gluten intolerance
* Dairy intolerance
* Diabetes





Now, I suspect it’s less about specific foods and more about *processed food*.

For example, I tolerate raw, unprocessed milk very well, and I can eat homemade, coarse bread without major issues. I mention this because bread and milk are staple foods here in Norway.





# Mental health





This long, unresolved health situation has caused significant anxiety and periods of depression throughout my life. With age, I’ve gotten better at coping, but it’s still a daily challenge.



After searching my entire life for something that fits me, I finally found a hobby that helps: **knife making**. It allows me to focus for short periods — sometimes an hour or two of light, varied work, or about 20 minutes of very intense focus. It has honestly been lifesaving for me, though my daily condition and anxiety still limit how much I can do.





# Why I’m here





I only discovered dysautonomia a few days ago. So far, it mostly seems to *confirm* things I’ve already learned the hard way — like elevating my legs, avoiding too much sugar, alcohol, and caffeine, and prioritizing fat and protein.



I’m posting here because, for the first time in my life, I want to see if someone recognizes this story. Maybe I can get advice, tips, or ideas on what steps to take next.



Thank you so much for reading. I truly appreciate any replies or further conversation.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

1q2vbcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writinghelp/comments/1q2vbcj/what_do_the_esteemed_members_of_rwritinghelp/,What do the esteemed members of r/writinghelp think of the first chapter of my potential novel? 5kish words,"Hi everyone. This is the full first chapter of a dark LitRPG / survival fantasy novel I’m working on. I’m especially looking for feedback on pacing, clarity, and emotional impact, particularly around the death-loop mechanics and whether the escalation feels natural rather than repetitive.

The style is intentionally restrained and grounded, with tight third-person perspective and minimal exposition. I’m less concerned with line-level nitpicks and more interested in whether the chapter holds attention, communicates its rules through action, and makes you want to keep reading.

Thanks in advance for any critique.

**Chapter 1 – Michael**

Michael’s single-room apartment was cold despite the ticking radiator. Grey light spilled through the curtains. The cramped space had its own smell: old carpet and stale air. A line of mostly empty pill bottles ringed the kitchenette countertop.

He lay there for a while after opening his eyes. It was difficult to find a reason to get up. He stared at the ceiling, at the huge water stain shaped like a heart, bisected by the seam. He’d meant to paint over it years ago, but it had been pushed down the priority list. A life of layoffs, illness, and economic despair had prevented any meaningful progress.

Many minutes later, when he finally swung his legs off the bed, his right knee ached, reminding him to move slower. And it wasn’t the only thing that forced him to take his time. His hips, his ankle, even his head demanded patience, even if it was frustrating to always be forced into it. Everything in him had slowed in a world that demanded he move faster.

He stood carefully and waited for the dizziness to pass before shuffling into the kitchen in threadbare socks, more habit than desire.

The old kettle sat on the back burner of his rusty stove, patches of corrosion showing beneath the eroded finish. He filled it with water from the tap and set it on the burner. He withdrew a match and lit it as he turned up the gas. A soft whoosh told him the flame had caught. The ignition built into the stovetop had broken long ago, another thing pushed down the list of priorities. He made do, as always.

He didn’t put on music. He didn’t turn on the television. Silence made mornings easier. It let him move without pretending he was anything he wasn’t, without forcing comparisons to anyone else. He paused at the small table that functioned as a dining room for one, pushed the curtain aside, and gazed out the narrow window at the alley between buildings. The same cracked concrete. The same garbage piled up.

He considered making toast, then gave up after a few moments. Even the small motivation needed for something that simple was missing. He didn’t taste much anymore anyway, and hunger had receded with age. Michael sighed.

For a moment he looked at the sink, considering whether he should wash the dishes, but there were none. He had never become messy, even as he lost the will to do much else. That was the joke. Even in the slow leak of days, he still wiped the counter. Still lined up the shoes by the door. Still folded the blanket on the old, frayed couch after using it. The body kept living by habit, even when the mind had stopped caring.

His outdated phone sat on the table where he’d left it the day before, its screen a spiderweb of cracks. No missed calls. No new messages. He scrolled the news anyway. Politics. Economics. The state of the country. It was always some mixture of greed and ignorance. Nothing ever changed.

He checked his email. Nothing. Who would contact him other than scams and junk? There was just nothing left to say.

He dragged himself to the armchair near the bed and lowered himself into it. The cushions had worn thin years ago, his shape pressed into them. The fabric was faded where his arm rested, rubbed down by years of skin and bone. The chair creaked when he sat, a small, sad sound that told him this was where he belonged.

He sank further into the cushions. There had been times when the world pulled at him. Once, he had loved a woman. He’d had a job he cared about being good at. Friends who had laughed with him. Those things still existed in his head. That was the only place they were now, filed away like photos in a drawer. It hurt, so he closed the drawer.

He rested his hands on his thighs and breathed in, listening to the silence.

When he moved, even a little, his body made noises. The faint whistle at the end of an exhale. The subtle crackle in his shoulder when he reached too far. His own heart beating, stubborn and unremarkable, a timer ticking down his life.

He knew what kind of man he was now. Not in a moral sense. In a mechanical one. A man whose days had thinned until they were composed of routine and waiting. A man who had outlived the version of himself that wanted things.

His apartment had become a quiet island. He hadn’t really pushed anyone away. Life had simply continued elsewhere once he stopped walking toward it, carrying others forward while he sat behind.

He looked at his knuckles, the skin creased and pale, veins faintly raised. His hands had done a lot in their time. Built things. Held things. He had lifted a child once, long ago, for a friend who needed help and didn’t want to look weak. Now they were hands that wiped counters and flicked through a phone, meaning nothing.

A thin cough rose in his chest. He covered it out of habit. It was dry, a little gravel in the throat, cleared with a sip of tea. The body’s reminders again. Not pain, not yet, just the ongoing inventory of wear.

He remained in his chair and dozed. The sun climbed higher. Light slid through the window and crept up the wall as the hours passed. There was comfort in its predictability. The world still ran. It just didn’t run for him anymore.

He leaned his head back against the chair and closed his eyes.

The day passed uneventfully.

He slept poorly in the chair until the light softened and shifted. At some point he stood, more because his hip had gone numb than because he wanted to move. He shuffled to the bathroom, which smelled of mildew, and turned on the tap. He watched the cold water run mostly clear with a faint tinge of brown, then drank straight from his cupped hands. It tasted like metal. He ignored it. He stared at his reflection as he drank.

His beard had grown patchy over the years. The skin along his jaw sagged. A red blotch clung to his cheek. He couldn’t remember when it had appeared, only that it was permanent now. He felt neither disgust nor pride. It was just his face, still there.

He returned to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. The light inside was bright and focused. The bulb cover had cracked, leaving it exposed. There wasn’t much inside. Old leftovers in plastic tubs that had certainly gone bad. A few eggs. Yellow mustard. A mostly used block of cheese, condensation clinging to its surface. He stood there considering, then finally closed the door. What was the point? The refrigerator motor kicked on with a low hum.

He lingered a moment longer, leaning against the counter, listening to the apartment breathe.

Somewhere in the building, an alarm chirped and stopped. A dog barked. A door slammed. The world outside his walls continued its loud, ordinary business. He could picture the street without seeing it: the small grocery on the corner, the bus stop, the cracked sidewalk buckled by tree roots. If he walked out there right now, he would be just another old man moving slowly, unnoticed. He had once thought invisibility was a kind of peace. Now it was simply how things were.

His phone buzzed once. Then again.

He moved too quickly to pick it up. A tiny, forgotten feeling pushed him forward despite the pain in his body. He squinted, hoping, and saw a calendar reminder he had set months ago for a doctor’s appointment. Michael’s face settled back into its normal expression. He had forgotten.

He could reschedule it. Or he could go. Both choices felt the same. He tapped the acknowledgment button, set the phone back down, and felt the faintest flicker of guilt, as if he’d done something wrong.

Evening came. He tried to read for a while. A paperback rested by the chair, its spine cracked, a bookmark halfway through: *The Man Who Fell to Earth* by Walter Tevis. He read a few pages before realizing he hadn’t absorbed a word and set it aside. He remembered enjoying it once. Now it seemed grey and lifeless.

Michael rested the open book on his thigh and drifted in and out of sleep.

When he woke again, his mouth was dry. The light had shifted. Time in the apartment moved by the sun and the ache in his joints. He looked at the clock on the wall, simple white hands on a beige face. It had been there when he moved in and had grown unreliable over the years. Its hands were slow, just like him.

He made another cup of coffee. Decaf. The caffeinated kind made him feel sick. He poured it into his chipped mug. It was too hot at first, so he blew on it, letting the warmth seep into his fingers.

He drank slowly.

The chair accepted him again without protest. The cushion knew his weight. He might have stayed there all evening if his bladder hadn’t begun to nag him. He stood once more, slower now, and as he turned toward the hallway, something shifted inside his chest.

A slight pain. Then pressure.

His breath caught and he sat back down, waiting for it to pass.

It didn’t.

“I need water,” he murmured. The pressure thickened into a tightness that spread toward his shoulder and down his arm. His hand opened and closed once without instruction.

Panic rose, then faded. His thoughts sharpened.

This isn’t indigestion.

His knees buckled.

He reached for the countertop and missed by inches. His fingers brushed empty air. The room tilted, slow at first, then sharper, like a floor dropping an inch too far.

He couldn’t catch himself. He hit the carpet hard on his hip. The mug slipped from his hand and struck the floor with a wet thud. Dark liquid soaked into the fibers.

He lay there, staring at the spill.

He worried the carpet would stain. Then he understood how foolish that was. Something told him it didn’t matter anymore.

The tightness in his chest became complete. His breathing slowed.

Should I call someone? The thought surfaced weakly. But his strength was gone. Even if he wanted to, how would he reach the phone?

His breath hitched. He pressed a hand to his chest, not to save himself, just to feel the wrongness. Warmth. His heart beating hard, then skipping, then pounding again.

He listened to that rhythm as the room dimmed.

He had expected something at the end. A regret. A face. A prayer. He had read that people relived their lives before they died.

Nothing came.

The pressure eased slightly, and foolish hope flickered. Maybe he was wrong. Maybe his body had corrected itself. He tried to breathe.

He couldn’t.

His hand slid from his chest to the carpet. His fingers spread, feeling the rough weave beneath his palm. His skin against the brown fibers looked like someone else’s hand.

His eyes closed as the world blinked out of existence.

Michael opened his eyes to a black sky and gasped, sucking frigid air into his lungs.

Stars littered the dark canvas, sharp and exposed, packed so tightly they looked like they might fall. Three moons hung above him, their light cutting the land into pale, hard shapes. The largest, massive and pale green, loomed low and close, its surface cratered and uneven. Another, silver and clean, was smaller but still many times the size of the one he was used to. The third was thin and distant, the color of blood and ash.

The sight tightened something in his chest before his mind could catch up.

He was naked, lying on fine sand. A heavy wind rolled over his skin and he shuddered.

Not a creeping chill. A seizure. His throat clenched. His teeth clacked hard enough to jar his jaw. The cold felt edged, aggressive, and heavy.

He sat up abruptly, and all he could see was sand. Dunes rose in rolling waves, lit by the stars and moons above.

It’s a dream, he thought. Am I still lying on the floor of my apartment?

But if it was a dream, it was more visceral and alive than any he had ever known.

His heart hammered in his chest. His breath came in sharp, painful pulls. His muscles shook as body heat was torn away from him.

He blinked hard.

The sky did not soften. The moons did not drift.

His body knew the sky it had lived under all its life.

This was definitely not it.

He pushed himself off the ground and stood, bracing against the wind. His head swiveled as he stared at the alien surroundings.

“Hello,” he began. What came out was a dry rasp that vanished into the howling wind.

Memories broke through in fragments. Carpet under his cheek. Coffee soaking into fibers. His lungs empty and not bothering to refill. A chair leg close enough to touch.

Then darkness. Then this.

Gooseflesh surged across his arms and thighs, painful in its intensity. Wind slid along his spine and between his legs, and the helplessness of his exposed body made his stomach clench. His teeth clattered.

He took a step. His foot sank slightly into the sand, then struck hard pack beneath a thin, shifting layer. Another step. He drew in a breath and caught a mouthful of grit, blown by the raging wind.

Michael hugged his arms against his naked skin, trying to warm himself, but it had little effect. He coughed again, painfully. He wiped his face absently, then froze when he saw bright red blood smeared across his forearm.

That broke something.

Panic rose, hot and clumsy.

He began to run, ignoring the freezing, paralyzing cold. He stumbled toward a rising dune and started to climb, clawing at it with his hands and pushing against loose granules with his bare feet.

After several minutes of effort, he reached the top, but nothing changed.

The dunes repeated as far as he could see in every direction. The moons held their positions. The stars shone without pattern or mercy.

“Where…” he gasped, confusion tipping fully into panic.

The sand behind him shifted.

He turned too fast and nearly lost his footing, dropping to one knee.

The surface near the base of the dune lifted in a smooth, deliberate ripple. Something moved beneath it.

The ripple swelled.

First a black-green fin broke through, followed by the top of a head. Red eyes surfaced. Skin the color of wet stone, blistered with pale nodules. Then its mouth pulled free of the sand, opening far too wide, lined with jagged, inward-pointing teeth.

The body surfaced partially, thick and jointless, gliding through sand as if it were water.

It swam toward him with terrifying speed.

Fear flooded Michael’s chest. He backed up too quickly. Loose sand gave way under his heel. He slid.

The creature surged. Sand sprayed off its body in a clean arc. Its mouth snapped shut where his leg had been a heartbeat earlier, the impact popping the air.

His body moved on its own. He ran.

The dune stole his footing, his feet burrowing with each step. His legs burned immediately, muscles screaming from cold and effort. He stumbled, caught himself, and felt something tear along his calf. Pain flared sharp and bright, then flattened under panic.

The ground heaved beneath him.

The creature struck from below.

An impact like a cannonball slammed into his right side, folding him instantly. He hit the ground hard, breath blasted from his chest. Hot teeth closed around his ribs. Bone crunched and shattered. Pain detonated through him, white and total, so intense it stripped thought away.

“AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”

His scream tore out of him, raw and useless.

He clawed helplessly at the thing’s scaly hide. His fingers slipped on slick nodules. His chest compressed. Breath punched out of him in a wet, broken sound. Teeth ground deeper. Something in his torso gave way with a dull, final sensation.

Sand poured over his face as he was dragged under.

The terrible cold vanished beneath pressure and grit. His lungs spasmed, pulling sand instead of air. The pain retreated.

Darkness closed in again.

Then nothing.

The choking stopped. He could breathe again.

Michael gasped as he opened his eyes.

Cold sand scraped his cheek as his chest heaved. Wind cut across his skin. His lungs burned, full and working, as if they had never been packed with grit. His throat didn’t tear. His ribs didn’t scream. The crushing pressure was gone.

He touched himself frantically, hands skimming his chest where only seconds ago a giant maw had crushed him. There was nothing. No blood. No pain.

He was alive.

He pushed himself up on his elbows, gagging anyway, because his body still believed it was suffocating. Spit spilled from his mouth. He tasted only sand and air. His chest rose and fell without resistance.

He stared at his hands.

They shook. They were whole. Unstained.

He sobbed quietly, pulling his knees to his chest.

Then fear surged again, the certainty that whatever it was would return. He lurched upright and the same sky slammed into him.

Three moons. Same positions. Same hard angles.

“What is this?” he whispered, tears running down his face.

The uncertainty struck him like a blow.

He scrambled to his feet too quickly and nearly fell. Ice-cold wind seized him again, immediate and punishing. His skin tightened. His teeth rattled. Wind hissed over the dunes with the same sharp edge.

The dune in front of him had the same crooked lip.

He stared at it, breathing hard, waiting for something, anything, to prove this was a dream or hallucination.

But it felt all too real.

He looked down at his pale, naked body. No wounds. No broken ribs. No crushed hip. His skin was young, fresh, and unmarked.

He clamped his fingers around his wrist.

A pulse. Fast. Strong.

He pinched the inside of his arm until pain flared sharp and bright. He did it again, harder. The sting stayed. He dug his nails into his palm and watched the skin split, a bead of blood rising.

The cold, horrible world did not retreat or fade.

His stomach rolled.

Memory crashed back in fragments. Teeth closing. Bone giving way. Pressure so intense it erased thought. Sand pouring over his face. The reflexive, useless attempt to breathe.

He had died.

“Oh god,” he whispered.

The sand around him lay smooth and undisturbed, as if nothing had ever broken its surface.

He turned slowly, scanning for any sign of the thing that had dragged him under. There were no tracks. No torn ridges. No dark stains soaking into the ground. The dunes held their shapes without blemish, repeated and pristine. He couldn’t even be sure he was in the same place. The sameness was fully disorienting.

Michael’s breath hitched. His mind scrambled for explanations. Shock. Hallucination. A seizure before death. Some final misfiring loop in a horrified brain.

He took a step backward.

The ground held.

Then the sand beneath his feet shifted.

“NO!”

He broke into a run.

Once again, he didn’t get far. A shallow ripple followed after him, smooth and deliberate.

He ran as hard as he could.

Bare feet slapped sand and slid. Cold air tore into his throat. Panic and terror burned through his lungs.

The ripple followed relentlessly.

He climbed another dune, hands digging in, nails scraping raw. He crested it and saw the same endless spread beyond. The same smooth repetition. The same empty horizon.

The sand ahead of him burst upward.

The creature rose where he was about to be.

Slick head. Tiny red eyes. Long face. Mouth opening with practiced inevitability.

It knew.

He tried to stop. Tried to turn. His heel skated. He went down hard, and the thing’s mouth clamped onto his ankle. Pain consumed him. The impact drove the breath out of him in a wet grunt.

Pain radiated through him, brighter and more focused. Bones compressed. Something inside his knee popped loose with a sensation that was not sound but failure.

“Agggg—”

His gargling scream tore out of him, thin and broken.

He clawed at it again, uselessly. Whatever it was, it was much stronger than him. He could not pull himself free. The pain sharpened until it drowned everything else as he was dragged under once more.

Sand flooded his mouth.

His lungs seized. The reflex to breathe turned into agony as grit jammed his windpipe. His vision tunneled. The pain began to blur, not fading, but losing shape as his body ran out of ways to respond.

Then there was nothing to push against.

Dark took him cleanly again.

And then, once more, he came back gasping.

He lay on the sand, cold air knifing into his lungs. Sand scraped his face. Wind hissed.

Three moons hung above him in the same imperfect triangle.

He lay there shaking, breath coming in ragged pulls.

Twice.

The word did not form yet, but the weight of it settled in his chest.

He had died. Twice.

And he was here again.

The thought finally locked into place, heavy and immovable.

Death was no exit.

“Am I in hell?” he whispered.

The sand around him lay smooth, waiting.

Michael named it the burrower. He didn’t know what it was exactly, but its intent was clear. It hunted him and dragged him down into the sand, over and over.

As he died repeatedly and began again in the icy desert, caught in a vicious cycle of death and rebirth, he came to realize he couldn’t run away. He was too slow, and it was too fast, and far too strong for him to escape. Each time he tried, it ended the same way: teeth, agony, and suffocation.

Still, his mind refused to settle. The terror came fresh with every cycle, sharp and sudden. Even knowing what waited beneath the sand didn’t dull it. His body remembered dying, but his mind couldn’t accept it.

At first, after each encounter, he woke screaming.

Then it became sobbing.

Then shaking so badly he could barely stand.

Eventually, he woke gasping and silent, chest heaving as the cold seized him again. The fear was still there, but it no longer drowned everything else. It had dulled just enough that he started noticing things he hadn’t before.

He began to notice his body was different.

Each reset returned him to the starting point, but now he fully registered that his old, weak body was gone. He felt young again. Strong in a way he hadn’t been in years. His muscles responded quickly. His lungs filled easily when they weren’t packed with sand. His heart beat hard and steady beneath his ribs. There was no stiffness in his joints, no lingering ache, no weakness from disuse.

Unfortunately for Michael, it didn’t help.

Not against the burrower.

The creature crushed him easily, again and again. His strength meant nothing once its jaws closed. His speed meant nothing once the ground gave way beneath him. Every death proved the same point with brutal clarity.

But the realization stuck anyway.

His body was not failing him. He was simply outmatched.

Over time, he stopped running at the first indication of the burrower.

Not because it was safe. Nothing here was. But panic didn’t help. When the sand shifted, he watched it. He learned its speed, the way it traveled in a straight line, the way it curved when he moved. He learned how close it could get before it broke the surface. He learned how long he had between recognition and impact.

He died for that knowledge. Repeatedly.

Sometimes he walked instead of ran, testing what would happen if he didn’t flee like an animal. The burrower followed all the same. Sometimes he climbed dunes and waited, muscles coiled, eyes locked on the sand. The creature seemed to choose its moment. It always struck when the ground favored it.

It didn’t toy with him. It was simply efficient.

That understanding changed something.

“If it doesn’t matter what I do, my only weapon is myself,” Michael mouthed, as the thought steadied him.

It settled into him slowly, heavy and unpleasant. I may not understand what this is, or what I am supposed to do, but if consequences reset after I die, then why not try something illogical?

Michael found himself staring at the sand more than the sky now.

Watching for imperfections. Watching for places where the surface looked tighter, more compact. Watching the way dunes formed basins and ridges, how slopes shifted underfoot. He didn’t know what he was looking for, only that reacting hadn’t worked.

If running failed, then maybe something else wouldn’t.

The idea was fragile, almost laughable. He had no weapons. No tools. Nothing but his own freezing body. But the thought refused to go away.

If death wasn’t the end…

Then maybe death meant nothing. Not in the way he had always believed.

The next time the sand rippled toward him, Michael didn’t scream.

He stood still, muscles tight, eyes fixed on the burrower’s shape, and waited.

He died again before he tried anything different.

Teeth. Pressure. Sand. Darkness.

When he came back gasping, naked and whole beneath the three moons, the memories didn’t fade, but the pain did. He was slowly beginning to feel the timing, the commitment.

The burrower always waited until it was near, underneath him, then rose to bite.

It never hesitated.

It never pulled away. Once it began the charge, it didn’t stop.

Michael stood shaking in the cold and stared at the sand until his eyes watered.

The dark ripple appeared and moved toward him again. Michael didn’t run.

He stepped toward it.

His body rebelled instantly. His legs locked. His stomach lurched. Every instinct screamed at him to flee, to climb, to do anything but meet the jaws of death head-on. He forced himself forward anyway, heart hammering, breath tearing at his throat.

The sand swelled.

The burrower erupted through the surface, jaws opening wide, teeth slick and waiting.

Michael jumped into it.

The impact knocked the breath out of him. Hot teeth closed around his leg and hip, crushing down with terrifying force. Bone failed with a sound he felt more than heard. Pain detonated, white and total, so intense it nearly erased him.

He screamed with agony and anger, but did not let go.

His leg snapped, flooding him with raw pain that shocked him back into the cold of the endless night. His femur broke inside the burrower’s closed jaws. A grey, bloody spike protruded from his flesh, jagged and horrifying, and in the same motion he wrenched it free through torn meat, the bone slick with blood and marrow. The sight barely registered. There was no room for horror now. Only pain, terror, and rage.

He drove the broken bone upward with all his remaining strength.

The burrower bit down again, harder this time.

Teeth tore into muscle and nerve. Michael’s vision went white at the edges. He screamed again, a raw animal sound that scraped his throat bloody, and kept stabbing at the barely exposed soft tissue inside the burrower’s mouth.

Finally, the jagged end of his shattered bone punched into the tissue at the top of the creature’s mouth.

Hot blood flowed over his hands.

The burrower thrashed and jerked, its body slamming against the sand, but it did not release him. Its jaws tightened, grinding, tearing. Michael sobbed and screamed and forced the bone deeper, again and again, feeling it scrape and catch against living flesh.

The two of them bled together under the moonlit sky.

The burrower convulsed violently, its movements losing rhythm and strength. Its jaws slackened just enough for him to wrench free, dragging ruined flesh with him as he fell hard onto the sand.

He lay there shaking, barely conscious, clutching the broken length of his own bone.

The creature writhed nearby. Blood steamed as it spilled onto the pale sand. Its body spasmed several times, then stilled. Its jaws sagged open, teeth dull. Its red eyes glazed.

The ground did not ripple.

The burrower was dead.

The realization landed slowly, as if his mind was afraid to believe it.

He laughed once, thin and broken, and the sound turned into a choking cough that sent fresh agony through his body. He lay on the blood-soaked sand, writhing.

His leg was ruined. His hip felt wrong. His hands and forearms were shredded. His lungs burned with every wheezing breath. Cold rushed in faster now, unopposed, as he realized he could barely feel his own body.

He would die again.

But he had killed it.

The thought stayed with him as darkness crept in. He struggled to maintain consciousness, but it was a losing battle.

This proved something. It could hurt.

The burrower could be killed.

As hopeless and cruel as this place was, as many times as it dragged him down and erased him, he was not entirely powerless, not if he was willing to give everything.

With that thought, cold and darkness took him.

When he opened his eyes again, naked and whole beneath the three moons, the burrower was gone.

The sand lay smooth around him, as if nothing had happened.",1,1767448848.0,writinghelp,0,1.0,False

*“That was Antipop Consortium with ‘Ghostlawns.’ Futuristic sounds for a tale of past times, delivered by your faithful friends at Radio PC. Did you love it as much as I did? Are you anxious to hear another song? If so, please listen on. As your ever-loving DJ, I promise to continue spinning an eclectic arrangement of top tracks, all thematically relevant to the story at hand.”*

 

Emmett was in bed now, his eyes pointed at the ceiling, seeing beyond the plaster. He wished that he’d saved all his old yearbooks, so that he could see his friends exactly as they’d been in elementary school. 

 

The mysterious narrative still perplexed him, but he knew that he’d listen for its entire duration. He had no other choice. Even if the story took weeks to complete, he would keep the headphones jammed into his ears, would even skip work if he had to. 

 

Whether the ghost stuff was true or not, there was definitely something strange going on. Some mysterious intelligence possessed far too much information about those bygone days, an unnamed DJ whose voice still seemed off. The fact that the DJ had started the story just after Emmett discovered the station couldn’t be mere coincidence. Perhaps the DJ himself was a ghost, with an urgent message to impart. 

 

What little he could remember of those days supported the broadcast. He remembered the night they’d gone toilet papering, remembered the way his stomach had lurched when Douglas plummeted headfirst from the swing. But Emmett had never once seen a ghost, though the tale claimed that they’d been all around him. He’d never seen someone levitate, or felt the chill of a poltergeist’s presence.

 

For just a moment, he wondered if the ghosts had been racist, had ignored him strictly because of his skin color. Immediately, he realized the thought’s absurdity. Surely there’d been black phantoms among the spirits. Maybe Emmett had been too closed-minded at the time to register the hauntings. Maybe he should stop worrying about it, and just enjoy the story. 

 

*“Continuing our tale, let us hop forward a couple of weeks. That’s right, no account of elementary school would be complete without mentioning the wonder of fifth-grade camp.*  

 

*“Douglas enjoyed fifth-grade camp immensely. Emmett and he shared a cabin with half a dozen boys from surrounding schools, boys who’d never heard of Douglas’ strange birth. Thus, he found himself with temporary friendships stretching for five straight days.* 

 

*“With over two hundred kids running rampant, supervised by counselors just a handful of years their senior, the mischief potential was high. Every morning featured a fresh pair of underpants atop the flagpole. Every night, the counselors snuck out for drinking and opposite sex fraternization. The teachers kept mainly to themselves, showing up only for meals and camp activities.* 

 

*“There were lectures, sure, covering topics such as diversity and conflict resolution, but no one paid them much attention. One night, each cabin had to devise a skit based on acceptance of others, performances more painful than amusing. Likewise, the group’s campfire sing-along was too corny to be believed.* 

 

*“Douglas enjoyed the hikes the most. Crossing streams on overturned tree trunks proved exhilarating, as did sprinting up a rock formation signifying some bygone Native American right of passage. There were movie nights, cinnamon rolls in the morning, meadows, pines and firs. While no bears appeared, Douglas saw squirrels, raccoons and deer roaming about, and even spied a gray fox from a distance. In Doane Pond, he viewed a multitude of fish in constant motion: trout, Bluegill, and catfish mostly.*  

 

*“Best of all, Douglas glimpsed not a single specter on Palomar Mountain. No agonized faces in the mirror, no little girl with only half a face, not even a hovering howler. Phantom whispers assailed him not; the white-masked demoness made no appearance. Unfortunately, that respite was short lived…”*    

 

\*          \*          \*

 

In Campanula Elementary’s parking lot, a swarm of cars, vans, and trucks waited to convey children homeward. Sunburned and dotted with insect bites, Douglas watched them leave. He waited and waited, tapping his hands against his thighs, but Carter Stanton never showed. At last, after forty-seven minutes of fruitless anticipation, Douglas gathered his sleeping bag, pillow, and black leather satchel—filled with clothes and assorted toiletries—and began the trek home. 

 

While he’d made the journey many times, Douglas could now barely trudge forward. His sleeping bag and pillow would not fit comfortably under his arm, and kept slipping down to the sidewalk. 

 

Finally, after much cursing and frustration, Douglas reached Calle Tranquila. Neighbors gawked at the shambling child, offering no conversation. 

 

Seeing his father’s Pathfinder in the driveway, Douglas grunted, enraged. He’d assumed the man was at work, but there was his vehicle, plain as day. Either he’d forgotten about picking Douglas up, or he’d deliberately stranded him. 

 

Opening the door, Douglas tossed his gear down. He began calling for his father, when a silver flash crossed his vision, accompanied by a whoosh of air. 

 

“Whoa,” he exhaled, stepping back for clarity. The silver blur struck again, mere inches from Douglas’ nose. Jumping back through the doorway, he saw his assailant clearly: a wild-eyed, snarling lunatic. “Dad, stop! What’s wrong with you?”

 

Carter advanced, thumping an aluminum bat against his palm. His eyes were bloodshot; he reeked of sweat and strong liquor. 

 

“It’s Douglas! It’s your son!” 

 

Carter twisted back for another swing, which Douglas terminated with an arm grasp. “Don’t do it, Dad. It’s me.”

 

His face slackening, Carter dropped the bat. His arms fell to his sides. “Douglas? *Douglas?* I thought you were at camp.”

 

“Camp’s over. You were supposed to pick me up.” With the danger gone, Douglas closed the door. He hoped that their neighbors hadn’t overheard too much. It wouldn’t do to have two parents in a madhouse. 

 

Carter slid slowly down the wall, until he was seated upon the travertine, his knees drawn to his chest. He began to laugh, harsh guffaws that brought tears streaming down his cheeks. “I was…I was supposed to pick you up. Pick *you* up.”

 

“What’s wrong with you, Dad? What happened?”   

 

“What happened, he asks. I’ll tell you what’s happening, sonny boy. Ghosts are happening. I see them all over Oceanside. I’ve seen them since the day you were born.”

 

“I see them, too. They’re not that bad, for the most part.”

 

“Oh, but they are. Don’t you understand, Douglas? I’ve tried to have a positive attitude lately, I really have. But we can’t have any privacy with those fuckers constantly popping out of thin air. Yesterday, when I was taking a piss, I saw a bloody-eyed ghoul in the toilet. Three nights ago, I heard my pillow laughing. I’ve seen pale men in our backyard, headless torsos convulsing across our living room. Just before you got here, something tossed me out of bed. I watched my mattress float to the ceiling, while an unseen force pinned me to the ground. I guess that’s why I snapped when you walked in; I thought you were another apparition. God, I could have killed you.”

 

“It’s okay, Dad, I understand. But there’s a bright side to all this, too.”

 

“Yeah? What?”

 

“If we’re seeing ghosts, then that means some part of us will still be around after death. We don’t just evaporate. Our essence lives on.”

 

“I *never* want to be like that, forced to walk the Earth without a body.”

 

Douglas awkwardly patted his father’s head, the same way that one would acknowledge an aging canine. “You don’t have to. You could let the Phantom Cabinet take you, let it break your soul apart to construct a whole bunch of new people.”

 

“The Phantom Cabinet? You’ve been watching too many cartoons, boy.”

 

“No, it’s true. I’ve…”

 

“That’s enough, Douglas. Go wash up now; you’re filthy. When you’re done, we’ll get something to eat.”

 

Sighing, Douglas acquiesced. Setting off toward the bathroom, he heard his father begin to giggle. It was a frightening sound. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Three weeks later, Douglas returned from school to hear a ringing phone. Snatching it from its cradle, he placed the receiver to his ear.

 

“Hello.”

 

“Douglas, my man! This is Benjy.”

 

“Hey, Benjy. What’s up?”

 

“You know it’s my birthday on Friday…right?”

 

“Sure do. Are you calling about a gift?”

 

“Of course not. I know you’ll get me something great. No, I’m trying to invite you to my birthday party. My parents are taking me to Steadfast Pizza, over in Carlsbad, and I’m inviting a bunch of kids from school.”

 

“Sure, I’ll go. Can your parents give me a ride?”

 

“Yeah, we’ll pick you up. No problem.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Friday’s final school bell sounded, Douglas raced home. After a quick shower, he found himself standing before the bathroom mirror, trying on shirt after shirt after shirt. Just as he settled upon a faded white Polo—a hand-me-down from his father—the phone rang. 

 

“Hello?” 

 

“Is Douglas there?” a female voice inquired. 

 

“You’re talking to him.”

 

“Oh. Hi…Douglas, this is Missy.”

 

“Hi.”

 

“Listen, I’m calling because Benjy canceled his birthday party. He asked me to tell you.”

 

“Really? I was with him at lunch, and he couldn’t stop talking about it.”

 

“Well, it’s cancelled.” Missy hung up then, leaving Douglas sputtering on an empty line. 

 

Eleven minutes later, there was a knock at the door.

 

“Dude, you ready?” asked Benjy, wearing a new leather jacket, under what looked like two gallons of hair cream.

 

“I thought your party was cancelled.”

 

“Huh? Why would you think that?”

 

“Missy Peterson just called and said so.”

 

“She was just messing with you, bro. Now come on.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Entering Steadfast Pizza, Douglas was overwhelmed by visual stimuli. News clippings, photographs, and trophies crowded the walls, celebrating a couple of decades of the Carlsbad community. Televisions were mounted amongst them, synchronized to display football skirmishing. Arcade games filled the eatery’s far end, operated by screaming children.   

 

Douglas and Benjy were led to a row of pushed-together tables, where three pitchers of soda awaited. As they made desultory conversation with Benjy’s parents, students from Campanula Elementary began streaming in. A pile of colorfully wrapped presents formed. Soon, four pizzas arrived.  

 

Emmett was there, of course. So were Missy Peterson, Starla Smith, Karen Sakihama and Etta Williams. Mike Munson showed up, as did Kevin Jones and Marty McGuire. When Emily Mortimer arrived, holding the hand of an aged male relative, Kevin began to chuckle. 

 

“Why’d you invite the spaz?” he asked.

 

“I didn’t want you to feel left out,” Benjy countered, as the relative kissed Emily and left the restaurant, stopping only to introduce himself to the Rothsteins. 

 

After the initial pizza distribution, the last arrivals staggered in: Clark Clemson and Milo Black, their faces flushed with probable intoxication. Clark slapped Douglas’ back as they passed, hard enough to leave a welt. 

 

“What’s up, Ghost Boy?” he bellowed.

 

The kids ate pizza, played arcade games, and refilled their soda glasses continuously. Then, after a rousing rendition of “Happy Birthday,” it was time for presents.

 

Douglas gifted Benjy a stack of comics, including a fourth printing edition of *The Death of Superman*. Emmett gave him *Super Mario Land*, a Game Boy game. As shredded wrapping paper accumulated, Benjy unveiled CDs, videocassettes, candy, and an unwanted Bible from Emily. When the last present had been opened—a whoopee cushion from Clark and Milo—Benjy’s parents announced that they’d be waiting in the Volvo.

 

Throughout the evening, Missy had neither spoken to nor glanced at Douglas. He hadn’t dared to ask her about the phone call. Perhaps she hated him so much that she couldn’t even stand his proximity. 

 

“Thank God they’re finally gone,” said Benjy. From his sweatshirt’s kangaroo pouch pocket, he drew forth a glass bottle. Waving stray classmates back to the table, he told the girls to space themselves between the boys.

 

“We’re gonna play a little game,” he announced. “You guys ready to spin this bottle?”

 

“No way,” complained Missy. “I’m not playing if there’s a chance I have to kiss Ghost Boy.” 

 

“Me neither,” announced Starla, haughtily.

 

Clark chimed in: “You heard them, dipshit. Go wait in the car with Benjy’s parents. Nobody wants you here.”

 

“Bullshit,” snapped Benjy. “Douglas is one of my best friends, and if he’s not going to play, no one will.”

 

“Yeah, shut up, Clark,” said Emmett, scowling. 

 

Starla climbed out of her chair. “Let’s go play some video games,” she demanded, her petite mouth drawn thin. 

 

“I’m with you,” said Missy. “Come on, Etta.”

 

Etta glanced from Missy to Emmett. “I’m staying here,” she said. 

 

Their noses held high, Starla and Missy strode off, leaving eight boys and three girls at the table. 

 

“Damn, they had to go and throw off the balance,” said Mike Munson. His dark hair was immaculately parted, revealing a ruler-straight line of pallid scalp. 

 

“Why don’t I play a video game?” Douglas whispered to Benjy. “I don’t want to ruin your party.”

 

“You’re not ruining anything. Those chicks knew we’d be playing Spin the Bottle; I told them this morning. If they want to exclude my buddy, then fuck ’em.”

 

Now Missy’s call made sense. She’d wanted to play Spin the Bottle, just not with Douglas. 

 

“Besides,” said Emmett, “we still have three beautiful ladies to smooch.” He winked at Etta and she looked at the table, embarrassed.  

 

“Two of them, anyway,” said Marty McGuire, an obvious jab at Emily. 

 

As the birthday boy, Benjy took the first spin. He found himself locking lips with Karen, knocking her wire-rimmed glasses from her head in the process. Etta spun next, with her bottle landing on Milo. Clearly disappointed, the girl gave him a quick peck. Next, Kevin gave the bottle a spin. It landed on Emmett, so he got another try. That spin landed on Karen, who remembered to remove her glasses. 

 

Marty kissed Emily; Emily kissed Emmett. When Clark got a chance to kiss Karen, he grabbed the back of her head, thrusting his tongue deep within her mouth. When he finally pulled away, the girl looked positively nauseous, dry heaving to the sound of Milo’s raucous laughter. 

 

Then it was Douglas’ turn. Never having been kissed before, he was a bundle of quivering nerves. His hand was so sweat-slickened that he could barely grip the bottle.

 

“Spin it, pussy!” cried Milo. “What, you afraid of girls or something?”

 

“No, I’m not afraid of you,” was Douglas’ lame retort. He wiped his hand on his shirt and gripped the bottle. Just as he was about to revolve it, a hand fell upon his shoulder. 

 

Douglas looked up to see the friendly face of a Steadfast Pizza employee. “I’m sorry, kids, but you can’t be making out in our restaurant. There are families here.”

 

Clark and Milo booed vociferously, but the man was unfazed. Missy and Starla stood just behind him, obviously responsible for spoiling Douglas’ big moment. 

 

After confiscating the bottle, the employee walked away, leaving the children nothing to do but play video games. One by one, their parents arrived to retrieve them. 

 

Just before Emily left, she pulled Douglas aside. “I’m sorry that you didn’t get a kiss. I’ll kiss you now, if you want.”

 

Reddening with embarrassment, Douglas said, “I guess so.” The girl pecked him on the lips, and then skipped out of the restaurant alongside her male relative. 

 

“Did you boys have fun?” asked Mr. Rothstein on the drive home. 

 

“I sure did. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mom.”

 

“And you, Douglas?”

 

“Yeah, it was great,” he replied, still tasting lip gloss and tomato sauce. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as Douglas replayed the day’s events in lieu of slumber, a black tendril swam from the shadows to caress his cheek. The tendril trailed up to a porcelain mask, drifting in wafts of putrescence. 

 

Floating in a relentlessly churning shroud, the entity addressed Douglas. *“You’re beginning to see, aren’t you? No matter how hard you try, you’ll never fit in. The pretty girls will never touch you, would prefer to forget you entirely. The best that you can hope for is a pity kiss.”*

 

Douglas knew that argumentation was useless. And so he lay silently, hoping to ignore the intruder into oblivion. 

 

*“You and I have a grand destiny set before us, boy. Through your body, I will rock the globe from its orbit. You will come to see the world as I do, see mankind for what it truly is: a failed experiment awaiting extinction.”*

 

The white mask floated closer, to press against Douglas’ face. Its touch was so glacial that, even as his bladder voided into his sheets, Douglas still couldn’t escape the chill. 

 

He blinked and the intruder was gone, leaving Douglas’ sour urine stench permeating the room. Tears cascaded down his face, accompanied by ugly-sounding sobs. 

 

On trembling limbs, Douglas lurched up from the bed. Grimacing, he stripped it down to the mattress. It was time to do some laundry.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The following Monday, Douglas and Emmett sat at a lunch table, having abandoned the playground for the foreseeable future. Conversations surrounded them, but the duo sat quietly, their thoughts sailing along divergent streams. 

 

It was cheeseburger day. Their trays held the remains of burgers and fries, ketchup spread in abstract smears. Around Douglas’ tray, a fly sluggishly flew, buzzing to acknowledge its repast.

 

Curiously, even though the lunch period was almost over, Benjy still hadn’t arrived. He’d been in class earlier, yet had lingered behind as they’d headed to the cafeteria. Whether he was ditching for the rest of the day or had gone to the nurse’s office, neither boy knew. 

 

As he idly drummed his fingers against the plastic tabletop, Emmett actually found himself anxious for the bell to ring. Without Benjy around to liven things up, Douglas was kind of a drag to be around. He was so withdrawn, so socially awkward, that it took a forceful personality such as Benjy’s to bring him even partially out of his shell. 

 

Douglas stared forward, seeing nothing. Instead, his thoughts were on the porcelain-masked entity. He’d seen an edited version of *The Exorcist* recently, and wondered if he could be rid of his nocturnal visitor by performing his own holy ritual. 

 

Persuading a priest to perform an exorcism would be too embarrassing, but Douglas could easily get ahold of a Bible and some holy water. From there, he could imitate the actions of Fathers Merrin and Karras. But would the gambit work, or would it just anger the entity, provoking her toward further acts of psychological terrorism?

 

Lost in their own musings, the two friends were oblivious to Benjy’s arrival. Only after the boy distinctly cleared his throat did their eyes fall upon him. 

 

“Whoa, what the heck?” asked Emmett. For their pal had not arrived alone. Their hands tightly linked, Benjy and Karen Sakihama stood boldly at the table’s head, sharing sidelong glances.

 

“I asked Karen out,” Benjy said matter-of-factly. 

 

“She’s your girlfriend now?” asked Douglas.

 

“She is.”

 

With Benjy’s girth and Karen’s compact body, the pairing was comically incongruous. Her thin fingers disappeared within his meaty paw; her head barely came up to Benjy’s shoulders. Still, they seemed happy, and neither Emmett nor Douglas could begrudge that.

 

“Why don’t you guys sit down?” Emmett suggested. The couple acquiesced, sliding onto a bench, wrapping their arms around each other. 

 

For the rest of the lunch period, Benjy and Karen had eyes only for one another. They whispered quietly amongst themselves, so subdued that their conversation remained private. Douglas and Emmett found themselves in the same situation as before, letting the minutes spin out slowly. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Frank, you’re back!”

 

The apparition hovered in his gleaming white spacesuit, his smile strained under its visor.

 

*“It’s good to see you, Douglas.”*

 

“Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in forever.”

 

Gordon sighed. *“I’ve been with the rest of the spooks, trapped within your scrawny little body. The bitch in the white mask is growing stronger, and she’s making it harder for me to manifest. I don’t think she wants you to see a friendly face.”*

 

Douglas flicked off the television. The thought of the porcelain-masked entity made him break out in flop sweat. “You know her? Why won’t she leave me alone?”

 

*“Do you remember that conversation we had, the one I told you to write down?”*

 

“Sure I do. I reread it all the time.”

 

*“Good. Do you remember when I told you that some parts of an individual’s personality don’t dissolve into the spirit foam?”*

 

“Yeah, you said that they merge together to form demons and other scary things.”

 

*“True. There are some personality components that won’t fit inside an infant. They only come into existence later, after long-term exposure to the evils of the world. A newborn knows nothing about terror or hatred. As it is, they can barely cope with the massiveness of the world beyond the womb.* 

 

*“Anyway, those traits are unneeded in crafting a new soul. Instead, they float around the Phantom Cabinet, seeking out similar traits. When enough of them come together, they can amalgamate. The results are never pleasant, and are responsible for many of mankind’s most terrifying nightmares.*

 

*“Of all those entities, that white-masked cunt is probably the worst. She’s not even really a woman, just something claiming that form. No, that rotten bitch is built from the hatreds and fears of millions of torture victims, people who’ve been forced to endure some of the sickest punishments imaginable.* 

 

*“Think about it, Douglas. While most of us find both positive and negative qualities in those we encounter, that mangled old hag only sees the negative. She knows nothing of love, nothing of kindness. She only knows razor kisses, the pain of an eyeball being gouged from one’s head, and other such agonies.”*

 

“Ouch.”

 

*“Ouch indeed. Imagine the madness that arises after hours of torture. Now imagine that madness multiplied by millions of lifetimes. That’s what you’re dealing with here.”*

 

“And how do you know so much about her?”

 

*“Oh, I know all of the entities inside you. It’s impossible to be in such constant proximity and not absorb at least some kind of impression. Especially this bitch; she radiates agony and terror like a busted nuclear reactor.*

 

*“She remembers concentration camps—the burn of Sachsenhausen mustard gas, having her muscles removed without anesthesia at Ravensbrück. In 70 AD, she was crucified along Appian Way, under the orders of a vicious bastard named Crassus.* 

 

*“She’s been placed inside a metal coffin, to be slowly eaten by animals. She’s worn a Spanish Boot, sat upon a Judas Cradle, smiled the Glasgow Smile, and languished inside an Iron Maiden. In China, she suffered a slow death by over three thousand cuts. She’s been impaled, had her bones shattered upon the breaking wheel, roasted inside a Brazen Bull.* 

 

*“Imagine being whipped, hung from meat hooks, raped to death, boiled alive, burned at the stake, flayed, disemboweled, and having your limbs pulled from their sockets. Now imagine reliving that suffering over and over again, all throughout eternity. That’s her mind state.”*

 

“Sheesh. I mean…what am I supposed to say to that? Isn’t there any way to get rid of her?”

 

*“None that I’m aware of. She’ll always be around, trying to influence you. The important thing is to ignore her. You’re a good kid, Douglas, and you need to hold onto that, no matter what the cost.”*

 

“I’ll try.”

 

*“Good. That’s good.”*

 

Douglas brightened up. “Anyway, I’m glad you came to visit. I’ve missed you, Frank. None of the other ghosts are any fun; most of them are pretty damn freaky. Can you hang out for a while?”

 

*“I’m not sure how long I’ll be able to manifest, but I’ll try to hold onto this form for a bit. Tell me, what’s been happening with our old friends, the X-Men?”*

 

“Oh, man. You gotta hear what happened to Wolverine. Magneto pulled all the adamantium out of his body…when they were fighting in outer space. Then Professor X got really mad, and he…”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

On Saturday morning, Benjy woke up facedown on his living room coffee table, drooling onto the mahogany. His eyes itched and his throat was sore, so he went to the kitchen for a drink. The area was empty; his parents were still asleep. 

 

Nestled between the milk and apple cider was a carton of orange juice, which looked pretty damn refreshing. He pulled a glass from the cupboard and began to pour. What emerged was not orange at all. Instead, the liquid was blood red. Highly viscous, it poured slowly, coating the side of the glass.   

 

Dry heaving, Benjy returned the carton to the fridge. From past experience, he knew that his parents would see plain old orange juice when they poured, but that thought provided him small comfort. 

 

He pulled a chair to the fridge, to reach the cupboards above it. The cupboards contained a vast alcohol assortment, including Triple Sec, vodka, tequila, Scotch, bourbon, wine, Jägermeister and Kahlua. Benjy rooted around until he located a half-filled bottle of Jack Daniel’s. 

 

He took a deep swig of whiskey, which sent him into a fit of explosive coughing. When he could breathe again, he took another gulp, and then put the bottle back. 

 

The liquor made his thoughts pleasantly hazy, blurring his sleepwalking concerns. Still, memories of a shifting tree and levitating sleeping bag tried to surface, so he picked up the phone. 

 

“Hello,” answered Mr. Sakihama, after four rings.  

 

“Hello, sir. Is Karen there?”

 

“Who’s this?”

 

“Benjy, sir.”

 

“Hold on.” The man’s altered cadence made his aversion obvious. 

 

A minute passed, and then: “Hello? Benjy?”

 

“Good morning, Karen. I was just thinking about you.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yeah, I was. In fact, I think I might love you.”

 

She giggled. “That’s so sweet. Seriously, you’re…*adorable*. Hey, what did you have for breakfast?”

 

“Pancakes,” he lied, even as his stomach growled. 

 

“I had oatmeal, but I put syrup on it, so it was kind of like pancakes.”

 

“Gross. Hey, do you want to do something later? I could get my mom to drop us off at the movies.”

 

“Hmmm…that sounds…fun. I have a piano lesson at three, but we can go after that. Maybe we can get some dinner, too.”

 

“Great. I’ll talk to ya later.”

 

“Bye-bye, Benjy.”

 

“Bye.”

 

He replaced the phone in its cradle, swung his arms at his sides, and then climbed the chair to filch a third swig of whiskey. With that accomplished, he decided on another call.

 

“Hello,” bellowed an angry voice at the line’s other end.

 

“Is this Clark?”

 

“No, this is his father. Who the fuck are you?”

 

“I’m his friend; that’s all you need to know. Hey, is he home?”

 

“Listen, you shrimp prick. You better learn some respect…before I feed you your fuckin’ teeth. I was trying to sleep. Now I have to deal with this shit?” 

 

There was some muffled conversation, and then: “Milo, is that you?”

 

“It’s Benjy. What’s up, Clark?”

 

“What’s going on, Fat Boy? I was just thinking about your birthday. Remember when I frenched your girlfriend? My tongue was halfway down her throat, practically in her stomach. I bet that’s further than you’ve gone with her, you fuckin’ wuss.”

 

“Yeah, but not as far as you’ve gone with your pit bull. How’s Brutus doing these days, anyway? Is he able to walk yet?”

 

“Fuck you.”

 

“Right back atcha.”

 

“Are you calling for a reason, or just looking to get your ass beat? Bring Ghost Boy along and I’ll make it a two-for-one deal.”

 

“That’s okay. Actually, I’m looking to get out of the house. Do you have any plans today?”

 

“Yeah, I’m meeting up with Milo in a little bit, and we’re going to chuck rocks at cars. Last time, we cracked some fruitcake’s window and almost caused an accident. It was hilarious. This other time, we stuck a boulder in the middle of the road and some dumb bitch ran it over. It tore up her undercarriage and left motor oil all over the place. She had to have it towed and everything.”

 

“Awesome. And you guys never got caught?”

 

“Naw. We’ve been chased before, but always got away. With a good hiding spot, we’ll be fine. You in?”

 

“Definitely.”

 

“Be at my house by ten, and make sure you bring your bike.”

 

“Got it.”

*“That was Antipop Consortium with ‘Ghostlawns.’ Futuristic sounds for a tale of past times, delivered by your faithful friends at Radio PC. Did you love it as much as I did? Are you anxious to hear another song? If so, please listen on. As your ever-loving DJ, I promise to continue spinning an eclectic arrangement of top tracks, all thematically relevant to the story at hand.”*

 

Emmett was in bed now, his eyes pointed at the ceiling, seeing beyond the plaster. He wished that he’d saved all his old yearbooks, so that he could see his friends exactly as they’d been in elementary school. 

 

The mysterious narrative still perplexed him, but he knew that he’d listen for its entire duration. He had no other choice. Even if the story took weeks to complete, he would keep the headphones jammed into his ears, would even skip work if he had to. 

 

Whether the ghost stuff was true or not, there was definitely something strange going on. Some mysterious intelligence possessed far too much information about those bygone days, an unnamed DJ whose voice still seemed off. The fact that the DJ had started the story just after Emmett discovered the station couldn’t be mere coincidence. Perhaps the DJ himself was a ghost, with an urgent message to impart. 

 

What little he could remember of those days supported the broadcast. He remembered the night they’d gone toilet papering, remembered the way his stomach had lurched when Douglas plummeted headfirst from the swing. But Emmett had never once seen a ghost, though the tale claimed that they’d been all around him. He’d never seen someone levitate, or felt the chill of a poltergeist’s presence.

 

For just a moment, he wondered if the ghosts had been racist, had ignored him strictly because of his skin color. Immediately, he realized the thought’s absurdity. Surely there’d been black phantoms among the spirits. Maybe Emmett had been too closed-minded at the time to register the hauntings. Maybe he should stop worrying about it, and just enjoy the story. 

 

*“Continuing our tale, let us hop forward a couple of weeks. That’s right, no account of elementary school would be complete without mentioning the wonder of fifth-grade camp.*  

 

*“Douglas enjoyed fifth-grade camp immensely. Emmett and he shared a cabin with half a dozen boys from surrounding schools, boys who’d never heard of Douglas’ strange birth. Thus, he found himself with temporary friendships stretching for five straight days.* 

 

*“With over two hundred kids running rampant, supervised by counselors just a handful of years their senior, the mischief potential was high. Every morning featured a fresh pair of underpants atop the flagpole. Every night, the counselors snuck out for drinking and opposite sex fraternization. The teachers kept mainly to themselves, showing up only for meals and camp activities.* 

 

*“There were lectures, sure, covering topics such as diversity and conflict resolution, but no one paid them much attention. One night, each cabin had to devise a skit based on acceptance of others, performances more painful than amusing. Likewise, the group’s campfire sing-along was too corny to be believed.* 

 

*“Douglas enjoyed the hikes the most. Crossing streams on overturned tree trunks proved exhilarating, as did sprinting up a rock formation signifying some bygone Native American right of passage. There were movie nights, cinnamon rolls in the morning, meadows, pines and firs. While no bears appeared, Douglas saw squirrels, raccoons and deer roaming about, and even spied a gray fox from a distance. In Doane Pond, he viewed a multitude of fish in constant motion: trout, Bluegill, and catfish mostly.*  

 

*“Best of all, Douglas glimpsed not a single specter on Palomar Mountain. No agonized faces in the mirror, no little girl with only half a face, not even a hovering howler. Phantom whispers assailed him not; the white-masked demoness made no appearance. Unfortunately, that respite was short lived…”*    

 

\*          \*          \*

 

In Campanula Elementary’s parking lot, a swarm of cars, vans, and trucks waited to convey children homeward. Sunburned and dotted with insect bites, Douglas watched them leave. He waited and waited, tapping his hands against his thighs, but Carter Stanton never showed. At last, after forty-seven minutes of fruitless anticipation, Douglas gathered his sleeping bag, pillow, and black leather satchel—filled with clothes and assorted toiletries—and began the trek home. 

 

While he’d made the journey many times, Douglas could now barely trudge forward. His sleeping bag and pillow would not fit comfortably under his arm, and kept slipping down to the sidewalk. 

 

Finally, after much cursing and frustration, Douglas reached Calle Tranquila. Neighbors gawked at the shambling child, offering no conversation. 

 

Seeing his father’s Pathfinder in the driveway, Douglas grunted, enraged. He’d assumed the man was at work, but there was his vehicle, plain as day. Either he’d forgotten about picking Douglas up, or he’d deliberately stranded him. 

 

Opening the door, Douglas tossed his gear down. He began calling for his father, when a silver flash crossed his vision, accompanied by a whoosh of air. 

 

“Whoa,” he exhaled, stepping back for clarity. The silver blur struck again, mere inches from Douglas’ nose. Jumping back through the doorway, he saw his assailant clearly: a wild-eyed, snarling lunatic. “Dad, stop! What’s wrong with you?”

 

Carter advanced, thumping an aluminum bat against his palm. His eyes were bloodshot; he reeked of sweat and strong liquor. 

 

“It’s Douglas! It’s your son!” 

 

Carter twisted back for another swing, which Douglas terminated with an arm grasp. “Don’t do it, Dad. It’s me.”

 

His face slackening, Carter dropped the bat. His arms fell to his sides. “Douglas? *Douglas?* I thought you were at camp.”

 

“Camp’s over. You were supposed to pick me up.” With the danger gone, Douglas closed the door. He hoped that their neighbors hadn’t overheard too much. It wouldn’t do to have two parents in a madhouse. 

 

Carter slid slowly down the wall, until he was seated upon the travertine, his knees drawn to his chest. He began to laugh, harsh guffaws that brought tears streaming down his cheeks. “I was…I was supposed to pick you up. Pick *you* up.”

 

“What’s wrong with you, Dad? What happened?”   

 

“What happened, he asks. I’ll tell you what’s happening, sonny boy. Ghosts are happening. I see them all over Oceanside. I’ve seen them since the day you were born.”

 

“I see them, too. They’re not that bad, for the most part.”

 

“Oh, but they are. Don’t you understand, Douglas? I’ve tried to have a positive attitude lately, I really have. But we can’t have any privacy with those fuckers constantly popping out of thin air. Yesterday, when I was taking a piss, I saw a bloody-eyed ghoul in the toilet. Three nights ago, I heard my pillow laughing. I’ve seen pale men in our backyard, headless torsos convulsing across our living room. Just before you got here, something tossed me out of bed. I watched my mattress float to the ceiling, while an unseen force pinned me to the ground. I guess that’s why I snapped when you walked in; I thought you were another apparition. God, I could have killed you.”

 

“It’s okay, Dad, I understand. But there’s a bright side to all this, too.”

 

“Yeah? What?”

 

“If we’re seeing ghosts, then that means some part of us will still be around after death. We don’t just evaporate. Our essence lives on.”

 

“I *never* want to be like that, forced to walk the Earth without a body.”

 

Douglas awkwardly patted his father’s head, the same way that one would acknowledge an aging canine. “You don’t have to. You could let the Phantom Cabinet take you, let it break your soul apart to construct a whole bunch of new people.”

 

“The Phantom Cabinet? You’ve been watching too many cartoons, boy.”

 

“No, it’s true. I’ve…”

 

“That’s enough, Douglas. Go wash up now; you’re filthy. When you’re done, we’ll get something to eat.”

 

Sighing, Douglas acquiesced. Setting off toward the bathroom, he heard his father begin to giggle. It was a frightening sound. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Three weeks later, Douglas returned from school to hear a ringing phone. Snatching it from its cradle, he placed the receiver to his ear.

 

“Hello.”

 

“Douglas, my man! This is Benjy.”

 

“Hey, Benjy. What’s up?”

 

“You know it’s my birthday on Friday…right?”

 

“Sure do. Are you calling about a gift?”

 

“Of course not. I know you’ll get me something great. No, I’m trying to invite you to my birthday party. My parents are taking me to Steadfast Pizza, over in Carlsbad, and I’m inviting a bunch of kids from school.”

 

“Sure, I’ll go. Can your parents give me a ride?”

 

“Yeah, we’ll pick you up. No problem.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Friday’s final school bell sounded, Douglas raced home. After a quick shower, he found himself standing before the bathroom mirror, trying on shirt after shirt after shirt. Just as he settled upon a faded white Polo—a hand-me-down from his father—the phone rang. 

 

“Hello?” 

 

“Is Douglas there?” a female voice inquired. 

 

“You’re talking to him.”

 

“Oh. Hi…Douglas, this is Missy.”

 

“Hi.”

 

“Listen, I’m calling because Benjy canceled his birthday party. He asked me to tell you.”

 

“Really? I was with him at lunch, and he couldn’t stop talking about it.”

 

“Well, it’s cancelled.” Missy hung up then, leaving Douglas sputtering on an empty line. 

 

Eleven minutes later, there was a knock at the door.

 

“Dude, you ready?” asked Benjy, wearing a new leather jacket, under what looked like two gallons of hair cream.

 

“I thought your party was cancelled.”

 

“Huh? Why would you think that?”

 

“Missy Peterson just called and said so.”

 

“She was just messing with you, bro. Now come on.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Entering Steadfast Pizza, Douglas was overwhelmed by visual stimuli. News clippings, photographs, and trophies crowded the walls, celebrating a couple of decades of the Carlsbad community. Televisions were mounted amongst them, synchronized to display football skirmishing. Arcade games filled the eatery’s far end, operated by screaming children.   

 

Douglas and Benjy were led to a row of pushed-together tables, where three pitchers of soda awaited. As they made desultory conversation with Benjy’s parents, students from Campanula Elementary began streaming in. A pile of colorfully wrapped presents formed. Soon, four pizzas arrived.  

 

Emmett was there, of course. So were Missy Peterson, Starla Smith, Karen Sakihama and Etta Williams. Mike Munson showed up, as did Kevin Jones and Marty McGuire. When Emily Mortimer arrived, holding the hand of an aged male relative, Kevin began to chuckle. 

 

“Why’d you invite the spaz?” he asked.

 

“I didn’t want you to feel left out,” Benjy countered, as the relative kissed Emily and left the restaurant, stopping only to introduce himself to the Rothsteins. 

 

After the initial pizza distribution, the last arrivals staggered in: Clark Clemson and Milo Black, their faces flushed with probable intoxication. Clark slapped Douglas’ back as they passed, hard enough to leave a welt. 

 

“What’s up, Ghost Boy?” he bellowed.

 

The kids ate pizza, played arcade games, and refilled their soda glasses continuously. Then, after a rousing rendition of “Happy Birthday,” it was time for presents.

 

Douglas gifted Benjy a stack of comics, including a fourth printing edition of *The Death of Superman*. Emmett gave him *Super Mario Land*, a Game Boy game. As shredded wrapping paper accumulated, Benjy unveiled CDs, videocassettes, candy, and an unwanted Bible from Emily. When the last present had been opened—a whoopee cushion from Clark and Milo—Benjy’s parents announced that they’d be waiting in the Volvo.

 

Throughout the evening, Missy had neither spoken to nor glanced at Douglas. He hadn’t dared to ask her about the phone call. Perhaps she hated him so much that she couldn’t even stand his proximity. 

 

“Thank God they’re finally gone,” said Benjy. From his sweatshirt’s kangaroo pouch pocket, he drew forth a glass bottle. Waving stray classmates back to the table, he told the girls to space themselves between the boys.

 

“We’re gonna play a little game,” he announced. “You guys ready to spin this bottle?”

 

“No way,” complained Missy. “I’m not playing if there’s a chance I have to kiss Ghost Boy.” 

 

“Me neither,” announced Starla, haughtily.

 

Clark chimed in: “You heard them, dipshit. Go wait in the car with Benjy’s parents. Nobody wants you here.”

 

“Bullshit,” snapped Benjy. “Douglas is one of my best friends, and if he’s not going to play, no one will.”

 

“Yeah, shut up, Clark,” said Emmett, scowling. 

 

Starla climbed out of her chair. “Let’s go play some video games,” she demanded, her petite mouth drawn thin. 

 

“I’m with you,” said Missy. “Come on, Etta.”

 

Etta glanced from Missy to Emmett. “I’m staying here,” she said. 

 

Their noses held high, Starla and Missy strode off, leaving eight boys and three girls at the table. 

 

“Damn, they had to go and throw off the balance,” said Mike Munson. His dark hair was immaculately parted, revealing a ruler-straight line of pallid scalp. 

 

“Why don’t I play a video game?” Douglas whispered to Benjy. “I don’t want to ruin your party.”

 

“You’re not ruining anything. Those chicks knew we’d be playing Spin the Bottle; I told them this morning. If they want to exclude my buddy, then fuck ’em.”

 

Now Missy’s call made sense. She’d wanted to play Spin the Bottle, just not with Douglas. 

 

“Besides,” said Emmett, “we still have three beautiful ladies to smooch.” He winked at Etta and she looked at the table, embarrassed.  

 

“Two of them, anyway,” said Marty McGuire, an obvious jab at Emily. 

 

As the birthday boy, Benjy took the first spin. He found himself locking lips with Karen, knocking her wire-rimmed glasses from her head in the process. Etta spun next, with her bottle landing on Milo. Clearly disappointed, the girl gave him a quick peck. Next, Kevin gave the bottle a spin. It landed on Emmett, so he got another try. That spin landed on Karen, who remembered to remove her glasses. 

 

Marty kissed Emily; Emily kissed Emmett. When Clark got a chance to kiss Karen, he grabbed the back of her head, thrusting his tongue deep within her mouth. When he finally pulled away, the girl looked positively nauseous, dry heaving to the sound of Milo’s raucous laughter. 

 

Then it was Douglas’ turn. Never having been kissed before, he was a bundle of quivering nerves. His hand was so sweat-slickened that he could barely grip the bottle.

 

“Spin it, pussy!” cried Milo. “What, you afraid of girls or something?”

 

“No, I’m not afraid of you,” was Douglas’ lame retort. He wiped his hand on his shirt and gripped the bottle. Just as he was about to revolve it, a hand fell upon his shoulder. 

 

Douglas looked up to see the friendly face of a Steadfast Pizza employee. “I’m sorry, kids, but you can’t be making out in our restaurant. There are families here.”

 

Clark and Milo booed vociferously, but the man was unfazed. Missy and Starla stood just behind him, obviously responsible for spoiling Douglas’ big moment. 

 

After confiscating the bottle, the employee walked away, leaving the children nothing to do but play video games. One by one, their parents arrived to retrieve them. 

 

Just before Emily left, she pulled Douglas aside. “I’m sorry that you didn’t get a kiss. I’ll kiss you now, if you want.”

 

Reddening with embarrassment, Douglas said, “I guess so.” The girl pecked him on the lips, and then skipped out of the restaurant alongside her male relative. 

 

“Did you boys have fun?” asked Mr. Rothstein on the drive home. 

 

“I sure did. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mom.”

 

“And you, Douglas?”

 

“Yeah, it was great,” he replied, still tasting lip gloss and tomato sauce. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as Douglas replayed the day’s events in lieu of slumber, a black tendril swam from the shadows to caress his cheek. The tendril trailed up to a porcelain mask, drifting in wafts of putrescence. 

 

Floating in a relentlessly churning shroud, the entity addressed Douglas. *“You’re beginning to see, aren’t you? No matter how hard you try, you’ll never fit in. The pretty girls will never touch you, would prefer to forget you entirely. The best that you can hope for is a pity kiss.”*

 

Douglas knew that argumentation was useless. And so he lay silently, hoping to ignore the intruder into oblivion. 

 

*“You and I have a grand destiny set before us, boy. Through your body, I will rock the globe from its orbit. You will come to see the world as I do, see mankind for what it truly is: a failed experiment awaiting extinction.”*

 

The white mask floated closer, to press against Douglas’ face. Its touch was so glacial that, even as his bladder voided into his sheets, Douglas still couldn’t escape the chill. 

 

He blinked and the intruder was gone, leaving Douglas’ sour urine stench permeating the room. Tears cascaded down his face, accompanied by ugly-sounding sobs. 

 

On trembling limbs, Douglas lurched up from the bed. Grimacing, he stripped it down to the mattress. It was time to do some laundry.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The following Monday, Douglas and Emmett sat at a lunch table, having abandoned the playground for the foreseeable future. Conversations surrounded them, but the duo sat quietly, their thoughts sailing along divergent streams. 

 

It was cheeseburger day. Their trays held the remains of burgers and fries, ketchup spread in abstract smears. Around Douglas’ tray, a fly sluggishly flew, buzzing to acknowledge its repast.

 

Curiously, even though the lunch period was almost over, Benjy still hadn’t arrived. He’d been in class earlier, yet had lingered behind as they’d headed to the cafeteria. Whether he was ditching for the rest of the day or had gone to the nurse’s office, neither boy knew. 

 

As he idly drummed his fingers against the plastic tabletop, Emmett actually found himself anxious for the bell to ring. Without Benjy around to liven things up, Douglas was kind of a drag to be around. He was so withdrawn, so socially awkward, that it took a forceful personality such as Benjy’s to bring him even partially out of his shell. 

 

Douglas stared forward, seeing nothing. Instead, his thoughts were on the porcelain-masked entity. He’d seen an edited version of *The Exorcist* recently, and wondered if he could be rid of his nocturnal visitor by performing his own holy ritual. 

 

Persuading a priest to perform an exorcism would be too embarrassing, but Douglas could easily get ahold of a Bible and some holy water. From there, he could imitate the actions of Fathers Merrin and Karras. But would the gambit work, or would it just anger the entity, provoking her toward further acts of psychological terrorism?

 

Lost in their own musings, the two friends were oblivious to Benjy’s arrival. Only after the boy distinctly cleared his throat did their eyes fall upon him. 

 

“Whoa, what the heck?” asked Emmett. For their pal had not arrived alone. Their hands tightly linked, Benjy and Karen Sakihama stood boldly at the table’s head, sharing sidelong glances.

 

“I asked Karen out,” Benjy said matter-of-factly. 

 

“She’s your girlfriend now?” asked Douglas.

 

“She is.”

 

With Benjy’s girth and Karen’s compact body, the pairing was comically incongruous. Her thin fingers disappeared within his meaty paw; her head barely came up to Benjy’s shoulders. Still, they seemed happy, and neither Emmett nor Douglas could begrudge that.

 

“Why don’t you guys sit down?” Emmett suggested. The couple acquiesced, sliding onto a bench, wrapping their arms around each other. 

 

For the rest of the lunch period, Benjy and Karen had eyes only for one another. They whispered quietly amongst themselves, so subdued that their conversation remained private. Douglas and Emmett found themselves in the same situation as before, letting the minutes spin out slowly. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Frank, you’re back!”

 

The apparition hovered in his gleaming white spacesuit, his smile strained under its visor.

 

*“It’s good to see you, Douglas.”*

 

“Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in forever.”

 

Gordon sighed. *“I’ve been with the rest of the spooks, trapped within your scrawny little body. The bitch in the white mask is growing stronger, and she’s making it harder for me to manifest. I don’t think she wants you to see a friendly face.”*

 

Douglas flicked off the television. The thought of the porcelain-masked entity made him break out in flop sweat. “You know her? Why won’t she leave me alone?”

 

*“Do you remember that conversation we had, the one I told you to write down?”*

 

“Sure I do. I reread it all the time.”

 

*“Good. Do you remember when I told you that some parts of an individual’s personality don’t dissolve into the spirit foam?”*

 

“Yeah, you said that they merge together to form demons and other scary things.”

 

*“True. There are some personality components that won’t fit inside an infant. They only come into existence later, after long-term exposure to the evils of the world. A newborn knows nothing about terror or hatred. As it is, they can barely cope with the massiveness of the world beyond the womb.* 

 

*“Anyway, those traits are unneeded in crafting a new soul. Instead, they float around the Phantom Cabinet, seeking out similar traits. When enough of them come together, they can amalgamate. The results are never pleasant, and are responsible for many of mankind’s most terrifying nightmares.*

 

*“Of all those entities, that white-masked cunt is probably the worst. She’s not even really a woman, just something claiming that form. No, that rotten bitch is built from the hatreds and fears of millions of torture victims, people who’ve been forced to endure some of the sickest punishments imaginable.* 

 

*“Think about it, Douglas. While most of us find both positive and negative qualities in those we encounter, that mangled old hag only sees the negative. She knows nothing of love, nothing of kindness. She only knows razor kisses, the pain of an eyeball being gouged from one’s head, and other such agonies.”*

 

“Ouch.”

 

*“Ouch indeed. Imagine the madness that arises after hours of torture. Now imagine that madness multiplied by millions of lifetimes. That’s what you’re dealing with here.”*

 

“And how do you know so much about her?”

 

*“Oh, I know all of the entities inside you. It’s impossible to be in such constant proximity and not absorb at least some kind of impression. Especially this bitch; she radiates agony and terror like a busted nuclear reactor.*

 

*“She remembers concentration camps—the burn of Sachsenhausen mustard gas, having her muscles removed without anesthesia at Ravensbrück. In 70 AD, she was crucified along Appian Way, under the orders of a vicious bastard named Crassus.* 

 

*“She’s been placed inside a metal coffin, to be slowly eaten by animals. She’s worn a Spanish Boot, sat upon a Judas Cradle, smiled the Glasgow Smile, and languished inside an Iron Maiden. In China, she suffered a slow death by over three thousand cuts. She’s been impaled, had her bones shattered upon the breaking wheel, roasted inside a Brazen Bull.* 

 

*“Imagine being whipped, hung from meat hooks, raped to death, boiled alive, burned at the stake, flayed, disemboweled, and having your limbs pulled from their sockets. Now imagine reliving that suffering over and over again, all throughout eternity. That’s her mind state.”*

 

“Sheesh. I mean…what am I supposed to say to that? Isn’t there any way to get rid of her?”

 

*“None that I’m aware of. She’ll always be around, trying to influence you. The important thing is to ignore her. You’re a good kid, Douglas, and you need to hold onto that, no matter what the cost.”*

 

“I’ll try.”

 

*“Good. That’s good.”*

 

Douglas brightened up. “Anyway, I’m glad you came to visit. I’ve missed you, Frank. None of the other ghosts are any fun; most of them are pretty damn freaky. Can you hang out for a while?”

 

*“I’m not sure how long I’ll be able to manifest, but I’ll try to hold onto this form for a bit. Tell me, what’s been happening with our old friends, the X-Men?”*

 

“Oh, man. You gotta hear what happened to Wolverine. Magneto pulled all the adamantium out of his body…when they were fighting in outer space. Then Professor X got really mad, and he…”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

On Saturday morning, Benjy woke up facedown on his living room coffee table, drooling onto the mahogany. His eyes itched and his throat was sore, so he went to the kitchen for a drink. The area was empty; his parents were still asleep. 

 

Nestled between the milk and apple cider was a carton of orange juice, which looked pretty damn refreshing. He pulled a glass from the cupboard and began to pour. What emerged was not orange at all. Instead, the liquid was blood red. Highly viscous, it poured slowly, coating the side of the glass.   

 

Dry heaving, Benjy returned the carton to the fridge. From past experience, he knew that his parents would see plain old orange juice when they poured, but that thought provided him small comfort. 

 

He pulled a chair to the fridge, to reach the cupboards above it. The cupboards contained a vast alcohol assortment, including Triple Sec, vodka, tequila, Scotch, bourbon, wine, Jägermeister and Kahlua. Benjy rooted around until he located a half-filled bottle of Jack Daniel’s. 

 

He took a deep swig of whiskey, which sent him into a fit of explosive coughing. When he could breathe again, he took another gulp, and then put the bottle back. 

 

The liquor made his thoughts pleasantly hazy, blurring his sleepwalking concerns. Still, memories of a shifting tree and levitating sleeping bag tried to surface, so he picked up the phone. 

 

“Hello,” answered Mr. Sakihama, after four rings.  

 

“Hello, sir. Is Karen there?”

 

“Who’s this?”

 

“Benjy, sir.”

 

“Hold on.” The man’s altered cadence made his aversion obvious. 

 

A minute passed, and then: “Hello? Benjy?”

 

“Good morning, Karen. I was just thinking about you.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yeah, I was. In fact, I think I might love you.”

 

She giggled. “That’s so sweet. Seriously, you’re…*adorable*. Hey, what did you have for breakfast?”

 

“Pancakes,” he lied, even as his stomach growled. 

 

“I had oatmeal, but I put syrup on it, so it was kind of like pancakes.”

 

“Gross. Hey, do you want to do something later? I could get my mom to drop us off at the movies.”

 

“Hmmm…that sounds…fun. I have a piano lesson at three, but we can go after that. Maybe we can get some dinner, too.”

 

“Great. I’ll talk to ya later.”

 

“Bye-bye, Benjy.”

 

“Bye.”

 

He replaced the phone in its cradle, swung his arms at his sides, and then climbed the chair to filch a third swig of whiskey. With that accomplished, he decided on another call.

 

“Hello,” bellowed an angry voice at the line’s other end.

 

“Is this Clark?”

 

“No, this is his father. Who the fuck are you?”

 

“I’m his friend; that’s all you need to know. Hey, is he home?”

 

“Listen, you shrimp prick. You better learn some respect…before I feed you your fuckin’ teeth. I was trying to sleep. Now I have to deal with this shit?” 

 

There was some muffled conversation, and then: “Milo, is that you?”

 

“It’s Benjy. What’s up, Clark?”

 

“What’s going on, Fat Boy? I was just thinking about your birthday. Remember when I frenched your girlfriend? My tongue was halfway down her throat, practically in her stomach. I bet that’s further than you’ve gone with her, you fuckin’ wuss.”

 

“Yeah, but not as far as you’ve gone with your pit bull. How’s Brutus doing these days, anyway? Is he able to walk yet?”

 

“Fuck you.”

 

“Right back atcha.”

 

“Are you calling for a reason, or just looking to get your ass beat? Bring Ghost Boy along and I’ll make it a two-for-one deal.”

 

“That’s okay. Actually, I’m looking to get out of the house. Do you have any plans today?”

 

“Yeah, I’m meeting up with Milo in a little bit, and we’re going to chuck rocks at cars. Last time, we cracked some fruitcake’s window and almost caused an accident. It was hilarious. This other time, we stuck a boulder in the middle of the road and some dumb bitch ran it over. It tore up her undercarriage and left motor oil all over the place. She had to have it towed and everything.”

 

“Awesome. And you guys never got caught?”

 

“Naw. We’ve been chased before, but always got away. With a good hiding spot, we’ll be fine. You in?”

 

“Definitely.”

 

“Be at my house by ten, and make sure you bring your bike.”

 

“Got it.”

Simple, comforting, perfect.","I promised my best friend and my little twin sister I’d be a lot less bombastic this year, so instead of big opinions, here’s a very PG, very G moment of quiet bliss.

I took a frozen young chicken that had been sitting in my freezer for six months, unwrapped it, set it on the trivet in my extra-wide 7.5L Instant Pot, added plain water up to the trivet, and cooked it for 70 minutes on Poultry with a natural release. No stock, no drama.

While that ran, I went to the store and bought a bag of plain white rice. Not jasmine, not brown. I’m from Hawaii. I rinsed it thoroughly, again and again, until the water ran clear, and cooked it in my new-to-me three-cup Toshiba fuzzy logic rice cooker. I used a Zojirushi for nearly 20 years, loved it, gave it up when I went carnivore, and decided this time to try something different. The Toshiba held its own.

I also grabbed a can of pinto beans, a can of mixed vegetables, butter, Crystal hot sauce, and later added pickled jalapeños. When the rice finished, I warmed it with the beans and vegetables, seasoned gently with cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Once the chicken cooled, I pulled all the meat from the bones and mixed everything together with the broth.
If I did it again, I’d put the bones back in and pressure cook them another 90 minutes for extra stock. Next time.

What I ended up with was deeply comforting: mostly chicken, plenty of broth, and just enough rice and vegetables to support it. I portion about 30 ounces per serving.

1q2va1h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2va1h,"Wanderer’s Birthday in China — 13 Buildings, Thousands of Ads, Drone Show, and GenshinFES","Among the past three years of Wanderer’s birthdays—and even among all Genshin Impact characters—this year’s birthday campaign is by far the largest ever.

- Entire buildings are fully wrapped for his birthday in 13 cities, including Beijing Station.
- Advertisements are running across 2,000 cities.
- 17,000 screens in the Beijing subway are showing Wanderer ads.
- City-wide advertising using thousands of buses.
- Ads displayed in 1,850 movie theaters.
- Multiple massive 3D billboard screens, plus large screens in 27 shopping malls.
- Drone shows held at night.
- Advertisements displayed on all Genshin players in e-commerce apps.
- Animated displays shown on Ferris wheels.
- Fan cafes opened in four cities, including cat cafes

At the same time, Genshin FES, an official miHoYo event, is currently being held in mainland China, and miHoYo is running an enormous amount of Wanderer advertising as part of it. 

There were several Wanderer exhibitions in the venue, and today Dawei(mihoyo CEO) and LuYin(Wanderer Chinese VA) celebrated his birthday.




P.S. Every year, the topic of Incel comes up in posts like this, so I'll write the answer first. Wanderer is the most popular character in China. He was the only one to rank in Genshin Impact, and won 3rd place after the romance game and Vtuber.
A small number of incells made a false report to cancel the event, but the event went smoothly.
The situation is not that bad, so please don't reply to this post with ""Incell"".",9,1767448753.0,Genshin_Impact,1,0.85,False

1q2v9oj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1q2v9oj/i_had_my_favorite_dream_of_all_time_last_night/,I had my favorite dream of all time last night,"It spanned multiple days and multiple decades, weaving back and forth between the past the present. It was definitely the most coherent dream I’ve ever had and I woke up feeling love and like I wanted to remember all of it. Normally I have nightmares so this was a nice break. 

The premise of the dream was that my spouse and I had a shared childhood friend. 

For me, when I was small, my mom would drop me off at a little cafe ran by a sweet lady when she went grocery shopping. I would spend time with her daughter who was my same age and even though we couldn’t talk a lot due to a language barrier we loved each other. her mom would always make me a little coffee. (This was not true IRL, just the dream). 

This same girl was also my spouse’s childhood best friend, and we realized the connection when we both wanted to invite the same person to our wedding. I knew her when she was little. when the dream friend was a little older she moved to Miami and met my spouse. 

At some point we went to visit her together, and they took me through a day in the life of their childhood. We put on dresses and scooted down the stairs on our butts, ate certain foods, did elaborate cheerleading stunts with other kids. 

During the part with the cheerleading stunts, one of the other kids got hurt and needed CPR, and the shared friend was suddenly an adult (she was a nurse as an adult) doing CPR. Me and my spouse were also suddenly adults, watching, while the other random kids were still kids. The kid was fine, and they all continued to play afterwards while we watched as grown ups. 

On a different day in the dream my mom died (she really did 2 years ago), and the friend’s mom died at the same time, leaving behind a little dog and a cat. The cat was my long lost cat George who ran away. I asked my spouse what we would do with them and she said, “obviously George is coming home with us” and said my dad needed a little dog to keep him company now. So the animals all had homes. I saw George in my house playing with my current cat and my cat who passed away a few months ago. ",2,1767448724.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

This suits my needs nicely, although I do find it a bit off-putting to have to hand grind first thing in the morning. However, I only really drink coffee at the weekends so less of an issue as I have more time. 

For reasons too boring to mention, I'm now considering a Wacaco Picopresso. I'd be using this daily for work and general walks out and about. I imagine my current grinder would be suitable for this, but I don't want to grind the night before or hand grind before work.

The one that seems to fit my budget and needs appears to be the Baratza Encore ESP. I know there are better espresso grinders, but I want one that can make nice coffee with my usual methods and espresso that will be at least ""good"". I'm at work and wandering around in the woods so I'm not chasing perfection, or doing tastings and making notes, but I don't want to drink bad coffee.

I have no intention of buying an espresso machine so I don't see the value in getting a really good espresso grinder. It may happen in time, but that's years away. I'm still relatively new to this so I'm only trying to address things as they arise, not pre-emptively fix problems I don't have. 

Any suggestions would be very appreciated. Thanks! ",1,1767448721.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

We met at Tom N Toms Coffee back home. No seats were available, so I asked if I could share her table. I noticed she was looking at me for a while yung tipong lutang lang, not intentionally staring. We ended up talking for about an hour. When we were about to leave, that’s when I asked for her socials.

Pag-uwi ko, I stalked her profile and contemplated for two days kung dapat ko ba siyang i-message. Eventually, I did—and we talked for hours. This time, siya na yung nag-aya na mag-hang out. Fast forward to our fourth meet-up, I asked if I could court her. She said yes, but only if I was willing to wait and introduce her to my family. Of course, as someone in my mid-20s, wala na akong time for puppy love. Date to marry mindset.

After a year, I realized she’s one of a kind. Wife material. Goal-oriented, emotionally mature, and very good at communicating. We’re both confident in our own ways. Pero for some reason, I feel like there’s a part of her that I don’t deserve. She’s too good for me at some point. What surprised me is that she opened up and said she feels the same way—that I’m too good for her. And mind you, I haven’t even told her what I’ve been feeling.

I dress well naman. I speak and present myself well. I smell good. I can say i'm a good conversationalist and I know I will be able to hold the date well. It's just the mental battle na iniisip ko, 

I'm not worthy to date until i am slimmer. 

Please be kind. And tell me if I should still go. He is kind naman and has even offered to start the coffee date early para makapag stroll pa kami, and even offered na mag dinner. Pero it's just me na nagkaka anxiety now.

We’ve had the machine for 3.5 years and it’s always been fine. Regularly cleaned/descaled etc.

We use the same beans all the time, and have always used the automatic dispensing setting for a double shot. Never messed with manual programming or anything. The only thing I have done (about two years ago) was adjust the internal coarseness setting.

Out of nowhere last week, the machine suddenly started grinding way less coffee. We usually have the dial at roughly the one o’clock position, but even when it is turned right up to maximum, it only just dispenses as much as it used to.

I have cleaned the machine, disassembled and cleaned the grinder etc., but it is still doing it. I am at a loss.

1q2uwud,https://i.redd.it/jp3xfk2j15bg1.jpeg,My message today,"Lately I have been struggling with grief. I have lost a loved one over the holidays. Ever since and honestly even before it has felt like I have been under attack by the enemy. Every morning I open my Bible randomly either before or after I have a conversation with GOD. I drink my coffee and try and decipher all of this in my head and how exactly it aligns with my life. This normally doesn't take alot of time but my anxiety does make me think about it throughout the day. Today my wife is sick. We have been feuding lately. Largely due to.the emotional baggage that we have been going through. Sometimes it is hard to find a way out of the darkness that plagues our lives. However, today my message was on point. Today I open my Bible.  At first I was led to 2 chronicles 30:6. I read both pages. The message I received was ""do not be like your parents"". Since my mother has always been an alcoholic and my father ended his own life, this really touched home for me. I am 11 years sober this month from both drugs and alcohol and the grief has been tugging at my demons. I thought to myself "" I see you and I hear you LORD. Thank you"". 
I then give it one more shot and I opened my Bible to a book that I have not even gotten to yet (I'm in psalms so far in my readings). I open to Mark Chapter 4 Verse 12 and it reads "" so that, they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and never hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!""
I thought to myself that this didn't make sense for me so I read both pages. Here was my message today. Mark Chapter 3 verse 20-34. The pieces that hit home for me were. The words in the picture above. We need to stand together in ways that we do not see. We are divided in so many ways. Wether it be emotion, political, beliefs etc. It doesn't matter because we are all one kingdom. Each of our houses are our own kingdoms. We only fall when we divide and emotional moments tend to cause weakness in the structure. This is a reminder to anyone who needs to hear this. Keep your Faith and your Love strong. They are what make us stand tall today. Trials and tribulations are like the darkness and Faith and Love are our light. GOD Bless you all and thank you LORD for letting me share this today.

1q2uw2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q2uw2p/i_feed_the_rich/,I Feed The Rich,"# PART I: THE MORNING RATTLES

Waking up was a slow, agonizing process of dragging my consciousness out of the black mud of a bourbon coma and into the grey, uncompromising light of 10:30 AM. The garbage truck outside was the alarm clock, a hydraulic beast that screamed like a dying dinosaur as it compressed the city’s filth three stories below my window. It slammed the dumpster back onto the asphalt, a metal-on-metal violence that vibrated up the brickwork, through the floorboards, and settled right behind my eyes like a terminal tumor.

I lay there for a long time, staring at the ceiling. There was a water stain up there, brown and spreading, that looked remarkably like a side-profile of Richard Nixon. I watched a cockroach navigate the treacherous terrain of Nixon’s nose, its antennae twitching and swaying. It was the only other living thing in the apartment, and frankly, I respected its survival instincts more than my own. It didn't have a mortgage, it didn't have a liver condition, and it didn't have to pretend to care about the intricacies of béchamel sauce. My sheets were damp. They usually were. I sweat when I drink, and I drink until the lights go out, so the bedroom always felt like a locker room by morning, a humid box containing the evidence of a man slowly pickling himself in his own misery.

My name is Elias. I’m thirty-four years old, according to the driver's license I rarely look at because the photo reminds me of a time when I had hope. If you saw me on the street, shuffling toward the L train in my oversized coat like a vagrant searching for a cigarette butt, you’d peg me for forty-five, maybe fifty. I’ve got the kind of face that looks like it’s been left out in the rain too long, pasty and eroded, with deep grooves running from my nose to the corners of my mouth. These aren't smile lines. They are the geological evidence of fifteen years of grimacing at incompetence in kitchens that were hotter than the surface of Venus. My hair is thinning, a brown receding tide leaving behind a forehead that feels permanently tight, like the skin is two sizes too small for the genius skull underneath.

I held my hands up in the dim light. They were big hands, the knuckles sworn enemies of each other, scarred white and pink from slips of the knife and burns from the flattop. The tips of my fingers were calloused so hard I could pick up a hot coal without feeling it for a good three seconds. They shook. Just a little. A fine, high-frequency tremor. The morning rattles, my old man used to call them before his liver turned into a decorative doorstop and checked him out of the game. They’d settle down once I got some caffeine or a hair of the dog, but right now, looking at them against the grey light, they looked like the hands of a nervous amateur. It was insulting. These hands were Stradivarius violins, and they were currently being played by a monkey with a hangover.

Ten years ago, these hands were insured. They were the hands of the sous-chef at L’Orage in Chicago, working under a sadistic French hack named Jean-Luc who thought throwing sauté pans was a leadership style. We made food that cost four hundred dollars a plate and left you hungry an hour later. It was all tweezers and foam and tiny portions of vegetables that had been tortured into shapes God never intended. I was good at it. I was better than Jean-Luc, and he knew it. I was fast, precise, and I had a palate that could pick out a single grain of extra salt in a five-gallon batch of veal stock. I was a culinary god, dispensing grace on porcelain plates to people who probably couldn't taste the difference between truffle oil and gasoline. But I also liked the snow. Cocaine is the diesel fuel of the high-end kitchen, it makes the eighteen-hour shifts feel like ten minutes, unties the knots in your back, and confirms your suspicion that you are indeed the center of the universe. Until the universe decides to foreclose.

I crashed hard. It wasn't a movie moment with explosions. I didn't burn the restaurant down or stab a critic, though I thought about it often. I just stopped showing up. I stayed in my apartment for three weeks, snorting the rent money and explaining to the walls why the Michelin guide was a political sham, until the eviction notice was stapled to my door. I pawned my custom Japanese knives, a set of Masamotos that were sharper than my ex's tongue, and drifted down the river until I washed up here. In the gutter. In the Meatpacking District. Doing the only thing I knew how to do, for people who didn't ask for references, only results.

I swung my legs out of bed. The floorboards were cold and sticky, coated in a layer of grime that defied mops. The apartment was a hole, a mattress on the floor, a pile of laundry that looked like a crime scene, and a bathroom with a toilet that ran constantly, a trickle of water that sounded like a ticking clock counting down to my liver failure. I walked to the sink and drank from the tap, the water tasting of rust and old pipes. I looked in the mirror. My eyes were red-rimmed, sinking into dark pockets of bruised skin. I looked like a ghoul. A handsome sonuva rotting corpse.

I showered hot, turning the knob until the water was just shy of scalding. I scrubbed with a bar of Lava soap, the gritty orange kind mechanics use to get grease out of their prints. I scrubbed until my skin turned pink, trying to scrape off the feeling of the previous night. It didn't work. It never works. The kitchen leaves a film on you, a metaphysical grease that no soap can touch. It settles in your pores like a disease. I put on my uniform, black Dickies that were fraying at the cuffs, a black t-shirt that had started life as a large but was now a medium thanks to cheap cotton, and heavy non-slip boots that cost me two weeks' pay but saved my back from snapping in half like a dry twig.

I hit the street at 11:15. Outside, the air was thick, humid, a wet blanket thrown over the city. July in the city is a punishment for sins you haven't committed yet. The Meatpacking District used to be all slaughterhouses and blood in the gutters, guys in bloody aprons smoking cigarettes on the loading docks. Real work. Now it was half-renovated lofts for tech bros with too much money and zero taste, and half-abandoned brick shells waiting for the wrecking ball. But the ground remembered. You could feel it through your soles. The cobblestones were slick with a century of rendered fat that no amount of rain could wash away. Sometimes, when the heat hits the pavement just right, you can smell it. The iron, the rot, the phantom scream of a million pigs dying in the dark. It smelled like home.

I walked to the subway, head down, hands in my pockets. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I didn't want to see anyone. They were all just obstacles in my path, cattle moving through chutes. I just wanted to get to the hole, do the work, and get back to the bottle.

On the train, I watched a guy in a cheap suit eating a bagel. He chewed with his mouth open, little bits of cream cheese sticking to his lip like a demented Santa Claus. I looked at his neck. Thick. Ropelike muscle. Sternocleidomastoid. Probably tough chewing. You’d have to braise that for six hours to get it tender, maybe in a red wine reduction with a lot of rosemary to cut the gamey taste of mediocrity. I imagined the knife sliding in just behind the ear, finding the gap.

I looked at a girl reading a paperback, holding the strap of her bag. Thin wrists. Tenderloin. The thought just popped in there, clinical and bored. The radial artery pulsed beneath pale, translucent skin. One slice. Just one. I wasn't hungry. I wasn't a monster. I was just a professional assessing the raw materials. That’s all people were to me now. Walking cuts of meat wrapped in Old Navy, waiting to be processed. Most of them wouldn't even make good stock.

# PART II: THE SHOP

The restaurant didn't have a name out front. No sign, no menu in the window, no ""A"" rating from the health department. It was in the basement of an old ice factory near the docks, a brick monolith that blocked out the sun and loomed over the street like a tombstone. The door was heavy steel, rusted at the bottom, covered in layers of tags from local gangs who didn't know what happened inside. Three deadbolts. I had the keys, a heavy ring that pulled down my belt loop like an anchor. I let myself in, locking the world out behind me.

The air inside was sixty degrees. Always. It hit the sweat on my neck and made me shiver. It tasted metallic, like licking a battery. It felt like a butcher shop, clinical and cold. If you’ve never been in a room designed for dismemberment, you can't imagine the specific acoustic quality. It’s dead. Sound doesn't travel, it drops to the floor and dies. 

I flipped the breakers. The bank of fluorescents overhead buzzed to life, flickering green and sickly yellow before settling into a harsh, uncompromising white glare that exposed every flaw in the stainless steel. The kitchen was my church and my prison. Stainless steel from floor to ceiling. Expensive stuff. Viking six-burner ranges, a Rational combi-oven that cost more than my parents' house and could cook a soufflé or a thigh bone with equal precision, a walk-in cooler big enough to park a sedan in. The owners, a consortium of silent partners I’d never met and never wanted to, didn't skimp on the hardware. They knew that to do this job right, you needed the best tools. 

You can't dismantle **them** with a dull knife.

I clocked in. Noon straight up.

My sous, Gregor, wouldn't be in for two hours. Just me and the hum of the compressors. I made coffee in the commercial dripper. Black, thick, bitter enough to strip the enamel off your teeth. I drank it standing over the stainless steel prep table, checking the inventory list on the clipboard. We were low on veal stock. Low on mirepoix. The walk-in was looking sad, just a few vacuum-sealed bags of flank steak left over from the weekend. It was embarrassing. A kitchen this good should be stocked.

The buzzer by the freight elevator went off at 1:00 PM. A harsh, electric ZZZRRRT that echoed in the empty kitchen like a fire alarm.

I wiped my hands on my apron, black rubber, heavy duty, and went to the back. The elevator rattled and groaned, the gears grinding like old bones. The doors slid open to reveal Sal.

Sal was a sweating mound of a man in a blue velvet tracksuit. He looked like a thumb that someone had drawn a face on with a sharpie. He was chewing gum, snapping it loud, staring at his phone. He had the intellect of a root vegetable and the hygiene of a sewer rat.

""Chef."" Sal grunted, not looking up.

""Sal."" I replied, my voice dripping with disdain he was too stupid to catch.

He had a hand truck with two black plastic bags on it. Heavy duty contractor bags. The kind you buy at Home Depot for yard waste or demolition debris. They were tied shut with zip ties. Classy.

""Two units."" Sal said. ""Fresh. Picked 'em up this morning. One male, one female.""

""Put 'em on the table. And try not to drop them this time, Sal. Bruised meat makes for a cloudy consommé.""

He wheeled them over and dumped them. The sound was a dull, wet thud. That’s the sound of dead weight. It’s distinct. It doesn't bounce. It doesn't rattle. It just lands and settles, like a bag of wet sand. A little fluid leaked from the corner of the bag containing the male, a dark, viscous trail that pooled on the white tile.

""Need the envelope."" Sal said, finally looking at me. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand. His eyes were small and shiny, greedy little beads.

I went to the office, spun the dial on the safe, and grabbed the cash. Five thousand dollars in used twenties. Sal counted it right there, licking his thumb between every few bills. I watched him, imagining the bacteria colony currently migrating from the money to his tongue. I also thought about how easy it would be to take that thumb off with the cleaver. Just a clean chop. He probably wouldn't even notice until he tried to count the next bill.

""See ya Thursday."" Sal said, pocketing the cash. He wheeled the hand truck back to the elevator. The doors closed, and I was alone again with the raw materials.

I turned the radio on. Q104.3. Classic Rock. Sweet Home Alabama started playing. I cranked it up. I needed the noise to fill the silence. The irony of butchering **them** to Lynyrd Skynyrd was not lost on me, but I didn't care.

I approached the table. I cut the first bag open with a box cutter. The smell hit me first. Not rot, not yet. Just the musk of unwashed clothes, stale fear, and the copper tang of blood that had stopped circulating hours ago. It’s a scent that sits in the back of your throat, thick and cloying.

I pulled the plastic back. The male. Mid-forties, maybe. Soft in the middle, a little paunch hanging over the waistband of his boxers. Manicured hands. He looked like an accountant or maybe a dentist. Someone who spent a lot of time sitting down in a leather chair, charging people too much for things they didn't understand. Now he was the product. His skin was pale, waxy, the blood pooling in his back. Livor mortis setting in, purple and splotchy like a bad bruise map. His eyes were half-open, clouded over, staring at the fluorescent lights with a look of mild surprise.

I stripped him. The clothes went into the incinerator bin immediately. Never leave a trace. I ran my hands over the body, checking for defects. Tumors, cysts, bad bruising. You can feel them under the skin, hard little knots that ruin the texture. He was clean, mostly. Just soft. A life of comfort makes for tender meat, but it lacks character.

I opened the second bag. The female. The jogger. She was different. Rigor had set in harder with her. Her limbs were stiff, locked in place. I had to force her arm down to the table, and I heard the dry crack of the shoulder tendon snapping. She was all muscle and tendon, lean, dehydrated. Her skin was tanned, leathery from the sun. This was going to be difficult work. Removing the skin from lean muscle is like trying to peel an orange that hasn't ripened yet; it clings, it tears.

I put on the chainmail glove on my left hand. Safety first. I grabbed my boning knife. It was a Wüsthof, six-inch, flexible blade. I’d sharpened it yesterday on the whetstone until it could shave the hair off my arm. It was the only thing in my life that I treated with genuine tenderness. The work is just work. That’s the thing people don't get. You think it would be a horror movie every time, screaming and madness. It’s not. It’s plumbing. It’s carpentry. It’s separating A from B. The human body is badly designed, frankly. The joints are complicated, the fascia is tough, and the meat-to-bone ratio is inefficient compared to a cow. God was a terrible engineer.

I started with the Dentist. I made an incision at the base of the throat, dragging the knife down the sternum. The skin parted, revealing the layer of yellow subcutaneous fat. It greased the blade instantly. The smell changed then. It became sweeter, heavier. Raw pork and iron. I worked the knife under the skin, flensing him. It made a sound like tearing wet Velcro. *Schhh-tkkk*. You have to be careful not to puncture the gut sack. One nick in the intestines and the whole room smells of shit, and the meat is tainted.

I peeled the skin back, rolling it away like a carpet. The Dentist was revealed in red and white. I took the head off first. We don't serve heads. Too much trouble, too recognizable, and the brain carries too many risks. Prions, madness. Plus, the skull is a pain to crack without making a mess. You have to find the gap between the vertebrae, the atlas and the axis. You slide the knife in, wiggle it to find the cartilage, and then push. I felt the resistance, the grit of bone on steel, and then the *pop*. I twisted the head. Connective tissue tore with a wet crunch. I carried the head to the disposal bin, a heavy red drum marked Biohazard, holding it by the hair like a bowling ball. His mouth hung open, silent.

Then the hands and feet. I used the cleaver for those. *Whack. Whack.* Clean cuts through the wrist and ankle joints. Into the grinder bin. Useless.

The torso is where the money is. I trimmed the tenderloins out from the inside of the ribcage. The psoas major. I reached inside the cavity, my gloved hands slick with fluids. The organs were cool and slippery. I pushed the intestines aside, grey, coiled snakes, to get to the spine. The loins came out smooth, two long strips of dark red meat, almost purple. Beautiful, really, if you forgot where they came from. They felt heavy in my hands. This was the only part of the dentist that had any value. The rest of him was likely disappointment.

I moved to the shoulders. The knife hit the ball joint. I had to pop it. I leaned my weight into it, pressing down with my palm on the spine of the knife. I heard the wet pop of the connective tissue giving way, followed by the sucking sound of the vacuum breaking in the joint. My back twinged. L4 and L5 vertebrae. They’ve been grinding against each other for years, a professional hazard of hunching over cutting boards. I grunted, shifting my stance, stretching my neck. I was probably going to end up on a table like this one day, and some other burnt-out hack would be complaining about my gristle.

I grabbed the reciprocating saw for the ribs. It’s a Dewalt, battery-operated. We just put a food-grade stainless steel blade on it. I pulled the trigger and the saw whined, a high-pitched dental drill sound. I bit into the bone. Bone dust flew up, white and powdery, catching in the light. It coated the back of my throat like chalk, tasting of calcium and burnt hair. The sound was deafening in the tiled room, the screech of metal on bone, vibrating through my teeth. *ZZZZZ-RRRRT.* The ribs gave way. I lifted the rib cage off like a shield.

By 4:00 PM, the dentist and the jogger were gone. The jogger had been a nightmare. Her fascia was tight, clinging to the muscle like superglue. I’d had to hack at her, and the cuts were ragged. I was sweating, my apron coated in a spray of red droplets. The floor was slick. Walking required a specific gait, a skating motion, to keep from busting your ass in the gore.

They were just vacuum-sealed bags of protein now. Labeled with a Sharpie. Dated. Loin. Shank. Rib. Belly. I looked at the bags. The jogger would be tough. All that running makes the meat stringy. She thought she was being healthy. She was just making my job harder.

I bleached the table. I sprayed it down with industrial solvent and scrubbed until the stainless steel gleamed. The water ran red into the floor drain, swirling down into the dark, carrying the day's sins into the sewer system. I watched a chunk of white fat swirl around the drain grate before slipping through.

Gregor came in at 4:15. Gregor is six-foot-five and wide as a doorframe. He has a shaved head and a face that looks like it was carved out of granite with a dull chisel. He doesn't talk. Literally. I think he can, he just chooses not to. He nodded at me, tied his apron on, and immediately started dicing onions. We have a good relationship. He chops, I cook, and neither of us talks about the nightmares. He’s the perfect sous-chef. Obedient, tireless, and silent. If only he could season a soup properly.

""Make a pâté with the liver from the male."" I told him, pointing to the container. ""It’s a little fatty, won't sear right. Loads of cognac and thyme. We need to mask the flavor of mediocrity. And strain it twice. I don't want any bile ducts in the mix.""

He gave me a thumbs up and grabbed the food processor.

# PART III: THE DINNER RUSH

Service started at 6:00. The printer kicked on. Chk-chk-chk. That sound triggers a Pavlovian response in any cook, adrenaline and hatred. It’s the sound of the enemy approaching.

TABLE 4: 2x Filet (MR), 1x Ribs, 1x Tartare.

""Order in."" I said, my voice flat.

""Heard."" Gregor grunted, a sound that rumbled in his chest like a rockslide.

I threw the filets on the flattop. The sound of meat hitting hot steel is universal. *Sssssss*. A plume of smoke rose up, tasting of garlic, browned butter, and that unmistakable sweetness. That’s the worst part of the job. It makes your mouth water. It triggers the hunger instinct. It smells like pork, but richer, more complex. It smells like the forbidden thing your DNA screams at you to recognize. You have to fight it. You have to remind yourself that you are cooking a tax attorney.

I basted the steaks with butter and thyme. The fat rendered out, golden and bubbling. I pressed them with my thumb. Soft, but springing back. Medium rare. The fibers were tightening, the proteins denaturing. I imagined the Dentist sitting in his chair, alive, never knowing that his gluteus medius would end up seared in duck fat and served with a red wine reduction.

I plated the tartare. Raw, hand-chopped meat from the Jogger's thigh. I mixed it with capers, shallots, Dijon, and a raw quail egg. It glistened under the heat lamps, a jewel of carnage.

""Pick up Table 4."" I called.

Lexi, our server, appeared. She looked like she hadn't slept in a week. Skinny, pale, eyes like pinpricks. Heroin chic, minus the chic. She grabbed the plates without looking at them. She never looked at the meat. She just wanted her shift drink and her envelope of cash.

The rush hit around 7:30. The tickets started piling up, a white snake of paper growing from the machine. My world shrank down to the three feet of space in front of the stove. It was hot. My chef’s jacket was soaked through. Sweat dripped off my nose and sizzled on the flattop.

""Refire on Table 7."" Lexi hissed, sliding a plate back into the window. ""Says it's chewy.""

I looked at the shank. It was braised for four hours. It was falling off the bone. It was perfect. The customer was an idiot.

""Guy’s a moron."" I said, grabbing the hot pan with a towel. ""Tell him I’m fixing it."" I didn't fix it. I just put more demi-glace on it and threw it under the salamander for thirty seconds to make it bubble. The heat would simulate freshness. ""Service!""

It’s a grind. You burn your hand on a handle, you swear, you keep moving. You drop a towel, you kick it aside. The kitchen is a machine, and you’re just a gear. The meat is just product. You stop thinking about the jogger. You stop thinking about the dentist. It’s just protein, heat, and time. And frankly, looking at the clientele, I wasn't sure the people on the plates were any worse than the people sitting in the chairs. At least the ones on the plates were quiet.

We ran a special on the ribs. BBQ glaze made with molasses and bourbon. People loved them. I watched a guy at Table 9 gnawing on a bone, sauce all over his face. He looked happy. He looked like he was eating at a backyard cookout on the Fourth of July. He didn't know the ribs came from a guy who probably coached Little League. Or maybe he did. Maybe that was the spice. Maybe the guilt tasted like umami.

At 8:00, the pilot light on the convection oven blew out. The kitchen filled with the taste of gas for ten seconds, a terrifying, chemical flavor in the back of the throat, before I got it relit with a stick lighter. *Whoosh*. The flame rolled out, singeing my eyebrows. Gregor looked at me, eyes wide.

""We're fine-"" I said, my heart hammering a little. ""Keep cooking. If we blow up, at least we won't have to clean the grease trap.""

We pushed through until 11:00. The tickets stopped coming. The dining room emptied out. The rich folks went home to their penthouses to sleep off their cannibalism and pretend they were civilized.

We cleaned up. I scrubbed the flattop with a heavy pumice brick until it shone like a mirror. Gregor took the trash out to the incinerator chute. We don't use the dumpsters. Everything goes in the fire. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

I clocked out at 1:00 AM. My back was screaming. My knees felt like they were full of broken glass. I walked out the back door into the alley. It was raining now, a cold, miserable drizzle that mixed with the steam from the vents. I went to McSorley's down the block. It’s a dive bar for the service industry ghosts who are too wired to sleep and too broke to party. I sat at the end of the bar.

""Bourbon."" I said. ""Leave the bottle.""

I drank until the edges of my vision got fuzzy. I looked at my hands. They were clean, scrubbed raw, but they didn't feel clean. They never felt clean. I rubbed my thumb over my index finger, feeling the phantom grease, the slip of the skin. I wondered if I was a monster. Then I remembered the tip out was six hundred dollars tonight. Monsters don't pay rent.

PART IV: RINSE AND REPEAT

The next day was a xerox of the one before, but with less toner. The edges were blurrier. I woke up. Garbage truck. Headache that felt like a nail driven between my eyes. Shower. Train. I felt heavier today. The hangover was sharper, a jagged presence. I popped three ibuprofen dry and washed them down with stale coffee from the pot I’d left on the counter.

I got to the shop at noon. Sal was late. He didn't show up until 1:45.

He had a kid with him this time. A skinny kid, maybe twenty, wearing a tracksuit that was too big for him. He looked like he was vibrating with anxiety.

""New guy."" Sal said, signing the clipboard. ""Training.""

The kid wouldn't look at the table. He wouldn't look at the black bags. He kept staring at the floor, shifting his weight from foot to foot. He looked like he was about to confess to a priest.

""Get him out of here-"" I said to Sal. ""He's gonna puke on my floor. I just sanitized that.""

Sal laughed, a wet, phlegmy sound. ""He's gotta learn, right? Break him in.""

""Not here…"" I said. ""I’m not a babysitter. And I don't want his vomit contaminating the mise-en-place.""

They left the units. Smaller today. ""Runaways."" Sal had said once, years ago. ""Nobody misses 'em. Ghost citizens."" I tried not to think about that. You can't think about that. If you start thinking about who they were, you can't use the knife. And if you can't use the knife, you can't pay the rent. And if you can't pay the rent, you’re on the street. And on the street, you become product. It’s a closed loop.

I prepped the meat. It was lean. Stringy. Malnourished muscle. I had to lard it with pork fat, actual pork fat, to make it edible. It took hours of meticulous work with a larding needle. My hands cramped up, the arthritis flaring in the damp air. I was essentially polishing a turd. No amount of technique could fix poverty.

Gregor came in. He saw the meat on the tray and frowned.

""I know-"" I said. ""We'll do a heavy sauce. Red wine reduction, heavy on the garlic and shallots. Hide the texture. These people wouldn't know good meat if it bit them.""

Gregor nodded and started peeling garlic.

# PART V: THE HERO ARRIVES

Service started at 6:00.

It was busy. Tuesday night, for some reason, brought out the freaks. We had a table of six Japanese businessmen who ordered everything on the menu, snapping pictures with their phones. I wondered if they’d post it on Instagram. #LongPig #Yummy. We had the Judge at Table 2. He came in every week. Fat, red-faced, always ordered the ribeye blue. He liked the blood. He probably jerked off thinking about it.

Around 7:30, the guy came in.

I spotted him right away through the pass. He was sitting at a two-top near the kitchen door. He stuck out like a sore thumb. He was wearing a suit, but it was cheap. Polyester blend. Shiny at the elbows. He looked like a cop, or maybe a building inspector who got lost. Or maybe a guy trying to sell me insurance.

He sat there. He didn't order wine. He ordered tap water.

He kept looking around. He looked nervous. He was sweating, wiping his forehead with a paper napkin. He wasn't looking at his phone. He was looking at the faces of the other diners. He was judging them. I recognized the look. It was the look of a man who thought he was better than the animals around him. Ironically, I felt the same way.

""Gregor."" I said quietly. ""Check out the guy at 9.""

Gregor looked up from his cutting board. He squinted. He made a face. *Cop?* he signed with his hand.

""Maybe-"" I said. ""He’s not eating. And his suit is a crime against fashion.""

The guy, let's call him the Hero, was watching the customers. He was watching the Judge eat his steak. He looked disgusted. He looked like he was about to cry. His hand was gripping the water glass so hard his knuckles were white.

I tried to ignore him. I had tickets. Chk-chk-chk.

TABLE 5: 3x Ribeye, 2x Osso Buco.

I turned to the stove. I had pans going. The heat was intense, a wall of BTUs.

Then the music stopped.

Not the radio. The dining room. It went quiet. The chatter, the clinking of silverware, the laughter, it all just cut out. I looked up. The Hero was standing. He’d knocked his chair over. He was holding a badge up in the air. A gold shield catching the candlelight.

""Nobody move!"" he screamed. His voice cracked. He sounded terrified, but determined. ""This is a crime scene! Everyone stay where you are!""

""Jesus…"" I muttered. ""Here we go."" I moved the risotto off the heat so it wouldn't scorch. Prioritizing the food, always.

The customers didn't freeze. They just looked confused. The Judge wiped his mouth with a linen napkin, looking annoyed. He’d paid good money for this meal. He probably had the Police Commissioner on speed dial.

""You people are sick!"" the Hero yelled. He pulled a gun from a holster on his belt. A Glock 19. It looked big and black in his shaking hand. ""It’s people! You’re eating people!""

That got a reaction. A woman screamed. Chairs scraped against the floorboards as people scrambled back. The Hero turned toward the kitchen. He knew. He was coming for the source. He kicked the swinging door open. It slammed against the stainless steel wall, knocking a ladle off the hook with a clang.

# PART VI: THE BUTCHER'S BILL

""Hands!"" he screamed at me. ""Show me your hands!""

I held them up. I had a pair of twelve-inch tongs in my right hand.

""Put it down!""

He was sweating buckets now. He came into the kitchen. He slipped a little on the grease near the fryer. He wasn't wearing non-slips. Amateur. He looked at the prep table. We had a bin of bones sitting there, waiting for the stock pot. A femur was sticking out. It was unmistakably human.

He gagged. ""Oh god...""

""You're in the way-"" I said. I don't know why I said it. It just came out. It was the cook in me. He was in my station. He was messing up the flow.

""Shut up! You... you butcher.""

He looked at Gregor. Gregor was holding his chef’s knife, a ten-inch blade. He hadn't moved. He was a statue.

""Drop the knife!"" the Hero shouted, swinging the gun toward Gregor.

He made a mistake. He took his eyes off me. He took his eyes off the environment. He didn't respect the kitchen. He thought the gun made him safe. He didn't realize that in here, everything is a weapon. I was standing next to the deep fryer. It was a Pitco, forty-pound capacity, bubbling away at 375 degrees. I had a basket of shoestring fries in there. I didn't plan it. I didn't think, *I’m going to kill this man*. I just acted. It was muscle memory. I grabbed the handle of the basket.

I pulled it out, dripping hot oil, and I swung it.

The arc of oil hit him in the face.

It wasn't a movie scream. It wasn't a hero's cry. It was a sound like a tire blowing out, just a sharp, wet gasp followed by a gurgle that climbed into a register no human should be able to reach. The oil coated his eyes, his nose, his mouth. It sizzled on contact.

He fired the gun. *Bang!*

The shot went wide, hitting the range hood with a clang that rang in my ears like a church bell.

He dropped to his knees, clawing at his face. The skin was already blistering, turning red and white, peeling away like wet paper under his own fingernails. He was stripping his own face off in a blind panic. He dropped the gun. It skittered across the quarry tile and went under the lowboy fridge.

I stepped forward. I grabbed a cast-iron skillet from the back burner. It was a ten-inch Lodge, seasoned for years. Heavy as a brick.

I swung it.

I hit him on the side of the head. It made a sound like dropping a melon on concrete. *Thwack.*

He went down face first. He twitched a couple of times, his heels drumming on the floor, and then he stopped.

Silence.

Just the hum of the fridge and the hiss of the fryer.

I stood there, breathing hard. My ears were ringing. I looked at the skillet. There was a dent in the rim and a smear of something dark and wet.

Gregor walked over. He looked at the body. He looked at me. He didn't look horrified. He looked annoyed.

He pointed to the pass.

""Risotto is dying."" He signed.

I looked out into the dining room. It was empty. The front door was open, letting in the street noise and the rain. They’d all run. The Judge, the businessmen, the couple. Gone. Like cockroaches when the lights turn on.

I looked down at the Hero. He was bleeding onto my clean floor. The oil was mixing with the blood, making a sludge. I felt tired. Bone tired. I looked at this dead man, this crusader who thought he could stop the machine, and I felt nothing but irritation. He had ruined service. He had wasted good product.

""Eighty-six the special."" I said. I dropped the skillet in the sink. *Clang*.

I looked at the clock. 7:45.

""Get the mop, Gregor-"" I said. ""And get the saw. We're gonna be here all night.""

# PART VII: HOT BREAKDOWN

There is a distinct difference between butchering a unit Sal drops off, cold, stiff, anonymous, and butchering a man who was screaming at you five minutes ago. The Hero was still warm. That changes everything. The blood hasn't settled. It’s loose, waiting to spill. We dragged him to the prep table. He was heavy, dead weight in a cheap suit. His face was a ruin, a map of blistered red flesh and melted synthetic fabric fused to his neck. It smelled horrific. Burnt hair and cooked meat. I had to breathe through my mouth.

""Cut the clothes off."" I told Gregor. ""Don't unzip. Just cut. I don't want to wrestle him.""

Gregor used shears. He snipped through the soggy, oil-stained jacket, the shirt, the trousers. We stripped him naked on the stainless steel. He was pale, unremarkable. A faded tattoo of an eagle on his shoulder. A scar on his appendix. A life lived, now ending on a prep table next to a bowl of half-chopped parsley.

I picked up the knife. My hand was steady now. The adrenaline had faded, replaced by the numb, cold focus of the work.

""Bucket."" I said.

Gregor slid the red plastic bin under the edge of the table.

I started with the throat to drain him. Since he wasn't hung up, it was messy. I made the cut deep, severing the jugular. The blood pumped out, weaker than a living heart but still possessing a momentum, washing over my hands, hot and sticky. It steamed in the cool air of the kitchen. Breaking down a warm body is slippery work. The fascia is slicker. The fat is softer. The knife slides too easily. I started removing the skin from the chest. It peeled away with ease, revealing the bright, oxygenated red of the muscle. It was vibrant, almost neon under the harsh lights.

""Look at this…"" I muttered, pointing to the pectoral muscle with the tip of my knife. ""Stress. The muscle is tight. Cortisol. He was terrified.""

Gregor grunted, wiping a splatter of blood from his cheek.

I removed the breastplate. The sound of the saw was louder now, or maybe the room was just quieter. *ZZZZ-RRRRT.* The smell of bone dust mixed with the smell of the fried face. It was a bouquet of nightmares. I lifted the ribs out. The lungs were pink and spongy, inflating slightly as the pressure changed. I cut them out and tossed them in the bin with a wet *slap*. The heart. I held it in my hand for a second. It was still twitching, just barely. A faint, residual electrical misfire. It felt heavy, dense. I thought about the man who owned it. He probably had a family. A dog. A mortgage. He thought he was doing the right thing. He came in here to save the world, and now he was going to be next week's ragu.

""Heart is good."" I said, dropping it into a metal hotel pan. ""We'll confit it. Duck fat and garlic. Serve it sliced cold.""

The hardest part was the legs. The Hero was big. I had to use the saw on the femurs. The noise was atrocious, a grinding screech that set my teeth on edge. Marrow splattered onto my apron. By 9:30, he was gone. He was just four bins of meat and a pile of bones. We ran the bones through the band saw, cutting them into manageable chunks for the incinerator. The head... That was the worst. I had to wrap it in three layers of trash bags to hide the smell of the burn.

I washed up at the sink. The water turned pink as it hit my hands. I scrubbed and scrubbed, using the Lava soap, then bleach, then lemon juice. But I could still smell it. The smell of the fryer oil on his face. It was stuck in my nostrils.

""You think they'll come looking for him?"" I asked the room.

Gregor shrugged. He was sharpening his knife, the rhythmic *shhh-shhh* sound filling the air. He didn't care. He was a machine. I was the one with the ghosts.

I walked to the walk-in cooler and opened the door. I hung the fresh bags on the meat hooks. *Loin. Flank. Shoulder.* I took a marker and wrote on the label: *HERO. 7/14.*

I stood there in the cold, surrounded by the hanging bags of the Dentist, the Jogger, and now the Cop. A whole community, hanging on hooks.

I closed the door. The latch clicked.

""Breakfast prep starts in six hours."" I said. ""We need to make biscuits.""

Gregor dragged the heavy black bag toward the incinerator chute. It slid across the sanitized tiles with a wet, heavy friction. He opened the hatch. The heat from the fire below roared up for a split second, orange and hungry, before he shoved the remnants into the dark and slammed the steel door shut. Gone. Just smoke in the chimney now. A faint smell of burning polyester drifted back, then vanished under the scent of bleach.

I looked at my hands.

They weren't shaking anymore.

That was the joke. That was the punchline. The violence didn't break me. It fixed me. The shaking wasn't fear. It was withdrawal. It was the engine idling, choking on air, waiting for the fuel. And I had just filled the tank.

I looked up at the range hood. There was a dent where the bullet had hit, a small, silver pockmark in the grain of the metal. It was the only evidence that anything had happened. I thought about the apartment uptown. The damp sheets. The cockroach on the ceiling. The water stain that looked like Nixon, judging me from the plaster. I didn't want to go back there. There was nothing there but sleep and the slow rot of a man waiting to die.

Here, in the cold, white light, under the hum of the compressor, there was purpose. There was a menu to plan.

I walked over to the pass. The risotto Gregor had abandoned during the chaos was sitting there, cold and congealed in the pan. I picked up a spoon. I tasted it.

It needed more salt.

""Gregor-"" I called out, my voice steady, clear, professional. ""Don't forget to strain the stock. And sharpen the slicer. We have a lot of cuts to prep for tomorrow.""

""Bon appétit,"" I whispered to the empty room.

My name is Elliot (FtM18) and I’m diagnosed with AuDHD (ADHD at 4 and Autism at 8), and I’ve been telling my mom (F54) she has it too for at least two years now.

I have a few biological signs like a cousin on my mom’s side with Lvl 3 autism and nonverbal, my Mom-mom (mom’s mom) recently getting diagnosed with ADD at age 75, my mom’s Dad having signs of autism the more stories mom tells, etc. 

There’s also behavioral signs. She’s been stimming recently, as an example, and I mention it to her because it makes me happy to see her so joyful. 

She also has a special interest (of forty years!!!) in spirituality and things like tarot cards, zodiac signs, fortune telling, spirit guides, psychic energies, etc. I actually asked her how talking about or indulging in such practices feels and she said it’s “like an extension of \[her\]self, it’s the one time \[she’s\] actually happy cause \[she\] can actually understand it and know what’s going on”. 

My mom’s youngest brother, my Uncle D (no full name for privacy reasons), is actually diagnosed with AuDHD as well! But because my uncle D is younger and there were more resources, which is why he was able to get diagnosed sooner, if at all. 

Mom has identifiable sensory issues (noise, temperature, smell, light), she has very literal thinking, defies societal expectations, has an enjoyment for routine but also a chaotic need for novelty (which she attributes to being a Gemini and having fast paced energy), comfort in unusual sitting positions (the turning point in \*my\* diagnosis cause I used to watch TV sitting upside down (mom wanted me to add that) ), evidence of stimulant usage in the form of her morning coffee, an understanding of the neurodivergent mind (me) that’s atypical for a supposedly neurotypical person, short term memory issues typical of someone with ADHD (source: me with the same damn issues), frequent thought blocking (losing one’s train of thought), notice of changes in preferred routine (she listens to the same music station and notices when new songs are added), I could go on. 

Keep in mind this is just what I can think of immediately. And what I’ve asked her about.

Any advice to help her advocate for a diagnosis? Or at least to continue identifying symptoms?

1q2uvsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrigeminalNeuralgia/comments/1q2uvsl/is_tn_always_progressive/,Is TN ALWAYS progressive?,"**Diagnosis**

Hi, I’m diagnosed at only 26 last 2023. For history, I’ve had migraine since childhood triggered by screens like excessive phone, laptop.

It’s very mild shocks in my right lower jaw that got me diagnosed with TN in 2 days. I was prescribed Oxcarb 300mg 1x a day for 3 months. It worked. I stopped in Nov 2023 thinking TN is gone.

**Comeback**

One month later on Dec 2023, I felt TN’s wrath for the first time. Shocks were definitely stronger. Same right lower jaw but now the shocks travel up to my right ear!

I experienced being MUTE, couldn’t talk, eat or brush my teeth. Even tapping my chin lightly causes pins and needles in my lower jaw.

I immediately took Trileptal 300mg 1xday again and within 3 days, it faded and was gone.

**Trileptal Days**

From Dec 2023 to last week of March 2024, I was taking Trileptal. I would stop once in a while because i get too constipated but would resume because I would get random shocks. Even licking my lips triggered a shock and I got so scared!

**Fasciculations**

By April 1 2024, I developed fasciculations started in my right foot arch. It would twitch constantly when at rest. and then at rest, random spots in my body would pop.

I got scared and tested if it’s Trileptal side effect so I stopped the meds again.

**Pregnancy**

Coincidentally, I found out I’m pregnant last week of April so I never got back to Trileptal.

**2 YEAR REMISSION**

From April 2024 and now it’s Jan 2026, my TN hasn’t come back. My entire pregnancy it’s gone and now my baby just turned 1 year old last December 2025.

I noticed I would get some very mild tingling or pain in my ear like the back of my ear, the upper area especially if I drink coffee. But enever the shocks again.

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. Is TN ALWAYS progessive?

ChatGPT told me it’s not always like that. That it can be controlled. It can calm down. When it comes back, Oxcarb can put it in remission again for years. It’s not always a downward spiral. Esp since mine respinds fast to Oxcarb and quieted down when pregnancy started until now.

That’s the first time I heard that. I tried reasoning but AI won’t budge and say these stories aren’t hanging out in threads like this but it’s evidence based. Is this true?

Because Based on what I’ve read online from communities of sufferers, it’s ALWAYS progressive.

It gets worse and worse and then one day, you’re on max dose of combi meds, tried all procedures and still no relief. So u are basically a living dead.

I mean what if I don’t have compression. That would be my fate.

I am so scared. And postpartum anxiety isn’t helping. I have two small kids who need me. And just thinking of the dark dark future scares me. I am very active, independent and thinking of the pain makes me a little depressed.

I don’t wanna do radiation too because that’s cancerous. And anesthesia dolorosa is scary!

Can y’all help shed some light on this?

1q2uvjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q2uvjz/how_to_bypass_xnxx_age_verification_in_the_uk/,How to Bypass XNXX Age Verification in the UK,"Ever since July 25, 2025, accessing XNXX in the UK has become a privacy nightmare. What used to be a simple ""Yes, I'm 18"" click now requires uploading your government ID or recording a live selfie. Sound invasive? You're not alone.

The UK's Online Safety Act transformed adult content access overnight. Now XNXX—along with hundreds of other sites—forces you to prove your age through methods that feel more like airport security than internet browsing. Many adults find themselves asking: is my privacy really worth handing over to access legal content?

Here's the thing: there's a straightforward way to bypass these checks without breaking any laws or compromising your safety. A VPN changes your digital location, making XNXX think you're browsing from a country without these restrictions. No ID uploads. No facial scans. Just private, secure access.

I've tested this method extensively across multiple VPNs and locations. It works. And in this guide, I'll show you exactly how to set it up in under five minutes.

>**⚠️ Disclaimer**  
This article discusses privacy concerns related to sharing personal data when accessing adult websites in the UK, from the perspective of adults who wish to remain anonymous. The content is provided for informational purposes only and is not, under any circumstances, intended for minors seeking to bypass restrictions. We do not promote, encourage, or endorse minors bypassing age verification. Your use of the content herein is entirely at your own risk.

# ✅ Quick Answer: How to Access XNXX Without Age Verification

If you're 18 or older and want to skip the invasive ID checks:

1. **Subscribe to a reliable VPN** like NordVPN (now 77% off)
2. **Install the app** on your device
3. **Connect to a server outside the UK** (Ireland, Germany, Netherlands work best)
4. **Visit XNXX normally**—no verification prompts will appear

The entire process takes less than 5 minutes. Your IP address changes, XNXX thinks you're abroad, and the age gate never triggers. Simple as that.

# Why Does XNXX Require Age Verification in the UK?

Let's cut through the noise here. XNXX isn't targeting you specifically—it's complying with the **UK Online Safety Act**, which went into full effect on July 25, 2025.

The law's intent is straightforward: keep minors from accessing pornography. Fair enough. But the execution? That's where things get problematic for adults.

# The Age Verification Methods XNXX Uses

When you try to access XNXX from a UK IP address, you'll encounter one of these verification methods:

|Verification Type|What You Submit|Privacy Concern|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Live Selfie**|Video of your face analyzed by AI|Biometric data stored by third parties|
|**Government ID**|Passport or driver's license upload|Full identity exposed to verification companies|
|**Credit Card**|Card details (no charge)|Financial information linked to adult content|
|**SMS Verification**|Mobile number confirmation|Phone number tied to browsing history|

All of these are handled by third-party services like **Yoti**, **AgeChecked**, or **AllPassTrust**. Not XNXX itself. Does that make you feel more secure? Didn't think so.

The verification companies claim they delete your data after confirming your age. Maybe they do. But here's what keeps me up at night: data breaches happen. Constantly. And when your government ID is sitting on a server somewhere linked to adult content sites, you're one hack away from a very awkward situation.

# Who's Really Responsible Here?

XNXX isn't doing this out of spite. Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, enforces the law with an iron fist. Sites that don't comply face fines up to **£18 million** or 10% of global revenue—whichever is higher. That's not pocket change.

But what about your privacy? The law prioritizes child protection (understandable) while treating adult privacy as collateral damage (frustrating).

>💡 **Pro Tip**  
The law applies based on your IP address, not your physical location. That's the loophole. Change your IP with a VPN, and XNXX can't tell you're in the UK.

# How to Bypass XNXX Age Verification: Step-by-Step Guide

I've bypassed these checks dozens of times during testing. Here's the exact process that works every single time.

# Step 1: Choose a Reliable VPN Service

Not all VPNs are created equal for this. You need:

* **Fast servers** (buffering kills the mood)
* **Strong encryption** (actual privacy, not marketing fluff)
* **No-logs policy** (verified by third-party audits)
* **Servers in XNXX-friendly countries** (where age checks don't exist)

After testing 15+ providers, I recommend **NordVPN** as the best overall choice. It hits every mark: blazing speeds, verified no-logs, and 8,800+ servers across 126 countries. Most importantly, it consistently bypasses XNXX's detection.

**Current pricing**: £2.49/month on the 2-year plan (77% off). That's less than a coffee per month for complete privacy.

Not ready to commit? NordVPN offers a **30-day money-back guarantee**. Test it, and if you hate it, get a full refund. No hassle.

**Budget alternative**: Surfshark starts at £1.99/month and allows unlimited device connections. Great if you're sharing with a partner or want protection on every device you own.

**Privacy purists**: Proton VPN offers a free version with servers in 10 countries. It's slower than paid options, but genuinely free (not a trial). Swiss-based with an audited no-logs policy.

# Step 2: Download and Install the VPN App

Head to your VPN provider's website—never download from third-party sites—and grab the app for your device.

**For desktop**:

* Windows, Mac, Linux versions available
* Download takes 30-60 seconds
* Installation is standard (click through the wizard)

**For mobile**:

* Download from Google Play Store (Android)
* Download from Apple App Store (iOS)
* Sign in with your account credentials

I tested on both Windows and Android. Installation was painless on both. No technical knowledge required.

# Step 3: Connect to a Server Outside the UK

This is where the magic happens. Launch your VPN app and you'll see a server list. Here's which countries work best:

|Country|Why It Works|Speed Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ireland** 🏆|Close proximity = fastest speeds|⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Netherlands**|Excellent infrastructure|⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Germany**|Massive server selection|⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Belgium**|Reliable, nearby|⚡⚡⚡⚡|
|**Switzerland**|Privacy-friendly laws|⚡⚡⚡|

**My recommendation**: Start with Ireland. It's geographically closest to the UK, which means the fastest possible speeds. I regularly hit 95%+ of my base connection speed when connected to Irish servers.

In NordVPN, connecting takes one click. Literally. Select Ireland from the map or list, click connect, wait 3-5 seconds. You're done.

Want to verify it worked? Google ""what's my IP address"" before and after connecting. You'll see your IP change from a UK address to an Irish one.

>⚡ **Performance Insight**  
Distance matters for VPN speeds. Ireland servers averaged 240 Mbps in my tests—more than enough for HD streaming. US servers were faster overall (280+ Mbps) but the extra latency isn't worth it when Ireland works perfectly.

# Step 4: Visit XNXX—No Verification Required

With your VPN connected, open your browser and navigate to XNXX normally. No incognito mode needed. No special steps.

What happens? Nothing. That's the point.

XNXX sees an Irish IP address and serves you the standard homepage. No age gate. No ID request. No verification prompt. Just content.

**Important**: Keep the VPN connected while browsing. If you disconnect mid-session, your UK IP gets exposed and the verification wall slams down immediately.

**Browser tip**: Clear your cookies before accessing XNXX if you previously attempted to visit without a VPN. Old session data can sometimes trigger verification prompts even with a VPN active.

# Does This Actually Work?

I tested this process across:

* 3 different VPNs (NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN)
* 5 server locations (Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, US)
* 4 devices (Windows laptop, Android phone, iPhone, MacBook)

**Success rate**: 100%. Every single time, connecting to a non-UK server bypassed the age check completely.

The only failures I encountered were user error—forgetting to connect the VPN, or having an old session cookie trigger the gate. Clear cookies, reconnect to VPN, problem solved.

# Best VPNs to Bypass XNXX Age Verification

I spent weeks testing VPNs specifically for this use case. Speed matters. Privacy matters. Reliability matters. Here are my top picks:

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall XNXX VPN

**Why it wins**: NordVPN nails the trifecta—speed, security, and simplicity.

**Pros**:

* **8,800+ servers in 126 countries** (tons of options for bypassing restrictions)
* **NordLynx protocol** (WireGuard-based, insanely fast)
* **Verified no-logs policy** (audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte)
* **Threat Protection** (blocks malware, ads, trackers—useful on sketchy sites)
* **10 simultaneous connections** (protect every device you own)

**Cons**:

* Monthly plan is pricey (£10.99/month—don't buy this)
* Kill switch occasionally drops on Linux (minor, rare)

**Speed test results** (from UK to Ireland server):

* Download: 243 Mbps
* Upload: 89 Mbps
* Latency: 12ms

That's barely a 14% speed reduction. Completely unnoticeable for streaming.

**Pricing**: £2.49/month on the 2-year plan (77% off). 30-day money-back guarantee.

**Bottom line**: If you want the best experience and don't mind paying slightly more than budget options, NordVPN is unbeatable. It's what I use personally.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

**Why it's great**: Excellent performance at an insane price.

**Pros**:

* **Unlimited device connections** (seriously, unlimited—protect everything)
* **CleanWeb 2.0** (ad and malware blocker)
* **4,500+ servers in 100 countries**
* **£1.99/month on 2-year plan** (cheapest premium VPN)
* **Camouflage Mode** (makes VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS)

**Cons**:

* Slightly slower than NordVPN on distant servers
* Desktop app occasionally feels sluggish (cosmetic issue)

**Speed test results**:

* Download: 218 Mbps
* Upload: 82 Mbps
* Latency: 15ms

Still excellent. The £0.50/month savings over NordVPN might matter if you're on a tight budget.

**Pricing**: £1.99/month (87% off). 30-day money-back guarantee.

**Bottom line**: Best value for money. Ideal if you're protecting multiple devices or sharing with a partner.

# 3. Proton VPN – Best for Privacy Purists

**Why it matters**: Swiss-based, audited, genuinely private.

**Pros**:

* **Free version available** (limited servers, but functional)
* **Swiss jurisdiction** (outside 5/9/14 Eyes surveillance alliances)
* **Open-source apps** (independently auditable code)
* **Secure Core servers** (routes traffic through privacy-friendly countries first)
* **Audited no-logs policy** (verified by Securitum)

**Cons**:

* Free version is slower (by design)
* Smaller server network than competitors (17,272 servers in 127 countries)
* More expensive than Surfshark

**Speed test results** (Proton VPN Plus):

* Download: 229 Mbps
* Upload: 86 Mbps
* Latency: 13ms

Solid performance. Free version caps speeds at around 80-100 Mbps (still fine for HD).

**Pricing**: Free version available. Plus plan: £3.59/month on 2-year plan (75% off).

**Bottom line**: If privacy is your top concern and you don't mind paying a bit more, Proton is the gold standard. The free version works for XNXX access if you're patient with slower speeds.

# Quick Comparison Table

|Feature|NordVPN 🏆|Surfshark|Proton VPN|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Monthly Price (2-year)**|£2.49|£1.99|£3.59|
|**Server Count**|8,800+|4,500+|17,272|
|**Speed (Ireland)**|243 Mbps|218 Mbps|229 Mbps|

|**Free Version**|❌|❌|✅|
|**Audited No-Logs**|✅|✅|✅|
|**Ad Blocker**|✅|✅|❌|
|**Winner**|Overall|Budget|Privacy|

All three work flawlessly for bypassing XNXX age verification. Your choice depends on priorities: performance (NordVPN), value (Surfshark), or privacy (Proton VPN).

# Understanding How VPNs Bypass Age Verification

Let's talk tech for a second. Understanding *why* VPNs work makes you smarter about using them.

# The IP Address Loophole

Age verification relies on a simple assumption: **your IP address reveals your location**.

When you connect to XNXX from a UK IP address (e.g., 81.107.xxx.xxx), the site queries a geolocation database. That database says ""UK."" XNXX activates the age gate.

When you connect through a VPN to Ireland, your IP changes to an Irish address (e.g., 109.255.xxx.xxx). Same database query. Different result: ""Ireland."" No age gate.

XNXX has no way to distinguish between:

* A genuine Irish resident browsing from Dublin
* A UK resident using a VPN server in Dublin

Both look identical from the server's perspective.

# What About Advanced Detection?

Some sites try to detect VPNs using:

**1. IP blocklists**  
Services like Netflix maintain massive lists of known VPN IPs and block them. Does XNXX do this? Not effectively. I've never encountered a blocked server across any of my tested VPNs.

**2. DNS leaks**  
If your DNS requests go to UK servers while your IP is Irish, that's suspicious. Good VPNs prevent this with **DNS leak protection**. NordVPN, Surfshark, and Proton VPN all passed leak tests flawlessly.

**3. WebRTC leaks**  
Your browser can accidentally expose your real IP through WebRTC. Again, good VPNs block this. (You can also disable WebRTC in browser settings as a backup.)

I ran comprehensive leak tests on all recommended VPNs using ipleak.net and browserleaks.com. Zero leaks detected.

>🔒 **Security Note**  
Always verify your VPN isn't leaking. Visit ipleak.net while connected. If you see your UK IP anywhere on that page, your VPN is misconfigured. Disconnect immediately and contact support.

# Encryption: The Privacy Layer

VPNs don't just change your IP—they **encrypt** your traffic.

Without a VPN:

* Your ISP sees: ""User visited XNXX.com at 10:47 PM""
* Potential data retention for government requests

With a VPN:

* Your ISP sees: ""User connected to 109.255.xxx.xxx (encrypted tunnel)""
* VPN provider sees: encrypted data (can't decrypt if no-logs)
* XNXX sees: Irish visitor, no link to your identity

**Encryption standard**: All recommended VPNs use **AES-256**, the same encryption banks and governments use. Completely unbreakable with current technology.

# Is Using a VPN to Bypass Age Verification Legal?

Short answer: **Yes, if you're over 18**.

Let's break down the legalities:

# The Law Doesn't Prohibit VPN Use

The UK Online Safety Act targets **platforms**, not **users**. It mandates that XNXX and similar sites verify ages. It says nothing about adults using privacy tools.

Using a VPN in the UK is completely legal. Millions do it daily for:

* Accessing geo-restricted streaming content
* Protecting privacy on public WiFi
* Bypassing workplace network restrictions
* Securing communications

The government has not—and realistically cannot—ban VPNs. Too many legitimate use cases exist.

# What About Terms of Service?

Here's where it gets slightly murky. XNXX's Terms of Service might technically prohibit circumventing age verification. But:

1. **Enforcement is impossible**. XNXX can't detect VPN use reliably enough to ban users.
2. **No legal consequences**. Breaking ToS isn't a crime—it's a civil matter between you and the platform. Worst case: account termination (and you can just make another account).

I'm not a lawyer, but I've researched this extensively. No UK residents have faced legal action for using VPNs to access adult content. None. The risk is theoretical, not practical.

# What If You're Under 18?

Stop reading. Seriously. This guide isn't for you.

The age restrictions exist for good reasons. Minors bypassing them may face consequences from parents, schools, or—if caught in extreme cases—law enforcement. Don't risk it.

>⚠️ **Warning**  
If you're under 18, using a VPN to bypass age verification violates the law's intent even if the technical act of VPN use is legal. Don't do it. Wait until you're of age.

# The Bigger Privacy Question

Is it *ethical* to bypass privacy-invasive checks? I'd argue yes. Adults have a right to access legal content without surrendering biometric data or government IDs to third-party companies.

The UK government framed this as ""protecting children."" But the implementation punishes adults by forcing them to choose between privacy and access to legal material. That's not acceptable in my view.

VPNs restore the balance. You can access legal content while maintaining your privacy. That's not a loophole—it's your right.

# Troubleshooting: When VPN Bypass Doesn't Work

Occasionally, you might hit issues. Here's how to fix them:

# Issue 1: Age Gate Still Appears

**Why**: XNXX cached your UK session before you connected to VPN.

**Fix**:

1. Disconnect from XNXX completely
2. Clear browser cookies for XNXX.com
3. Reconnect to VPN
4. Open XNXX in a new private/incognito window

Works every time. Cookies are the culprit 90% of the time.

# Issue 2: VPN Connected, But Slow Speeds

**Why**: Server congestion or distance.

**Fix**:

1. Switch to a different server in the same country
2. Try a closer country (Ireland instead of US)
3. Use the VPN's ""Quick Connect"" feature (auto-selects fastest server)
4. Upgrade your VPN protocol to WireGuard/NordLynx if available

# Issue 3: Website Loads But Videos Won't Play

**Why**: Ad blocker conflict or browser issue.

**Fix**:

1. Disable browser ad blockers temporarily
2. Enable VPN's built-in ad blocker instead (more compatible)
3. Try a different browser
4. Check if WebRTC is enabled (videos may require it)

# Issue 4: ""VPN Detected"" Error

**Why**: XNXX blacklisted that specific server IP.

**Fix**:

1. Disconnect and reconnect (usually assigns new IP)
2. Switch to different server in same country
3. Try obfuscated servers if available (NordVPN offers these)

I've personally never seen this error on XNXX, but if it happens, server-hopping solves it.

# Issue 5: VPN Disconnects Randomly

**Why**: Network instability or kill switch false positives.

**Fix**:

1. Enable ""Auto-reconnect"" in VPN settings
2. Check kill switch settings (might be too aggressive)
3. Switch from WiFi to Ethernet if possible
4. Update VPN app to latest version

Persistent disconnections usually indicate ISP throttling or firewall interference. Contact your VPN's support—they can troubleshoot further.

# Privacy Best Practices When Using XNXX

Using a VPN solves the age verification problem. But true privacy requires a few extra steps:

# 1. Always Use HTTPS

XNXX uses HTTPS by default (look for the padlock in your browser). This encrypts your connection to the site itself. Combined with VPN encryption, you have two layers of protection.

If you ever see ""http://"" (no 'S'), leave immediately. That site is insecure.

# 2. Clear Cookies Regularly

Cookies track your browsing across sessions. After you're done, clear site cookies to prevent tracking.

**Chrome/Edge**: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cookies **Firefox**: Options → Privacy → Clear Data → Cookies **Safari**: Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data

Or just browse in incognito/private mode. Cookies auto-delete when you close the window.

# 3. Use a Separate Email for Account Signups

If XNXX requires account creation (some features do), don't use your main email. Create a throwaway address on ProtonMail or Tutanota.

Why? Data breaches happen. Adult sites are prime targets. Separate email = separate identity.

# 4. Avoid Payment Methods Linked to Identity

If you're subscribing to premium features, use:

* **Prepaid cards** (buy with cash, untraceable)
* **Cryptocurrency** (Bitcoin, Monero if accepted)
* **Virtual credit cards** (Privacy.com, Revolut disposable cards)

Never use your primary credit card. Financial data + adult content = privacy nightmare if breached.

# 5. Enable Your VPN's Kill Switch

A kill switch cuts your internet if the VPN disconnects. This prevents your UK IP from leaking mid-session.

**NordVPN**: Settings → Kill Switch → Enable **Surfshark**: Settings → VPN Settings → Kill Switch → On **Proton VPN**: Settings → Connection → Kill Switch → Enable

I enable this on every VPN I use. It's saved me from accidental exposure more than once.

# 6. Check for DNS/IP Leaks Before Browsing

Every single time you connect, verify your VPN is working:

1. Visit ipleak.net
2. Check ""Your IP"" section (should show VPN server location, not UK)
3. Check ""DNS Addresses"" section (should show VPN's DNS, not ISP's)
4. Check ""WebRTC Detection"" (should show VPN IP, not real IP)

If anything shows your UK IP, stop immediately. Reconnect or switch servers.

# Alternatives to VPNs (And Why They're Worse)

Some people suggest non-VPN methods. I tested them. Here's why I don't recommend them:

# Tor Browser

**What it is**: Anonymous browser that routes traffic through volunteer nodes.

**Pros**:

* Free
* Excellent anonymity

**Cons**:

* Painfully slow (unusable for video streaming)
* Exit nodes can be compromised
* Many sites block Tor traffic

**Verdict**: Great for anonymity, terrible for porn. Video buffering makes it unusable.

# Proxy Sites

**What it is**: Websites that relay your traffic through their servers.

**Pros**:

* Free
* No installation required

**Cons**:

* Usually unencrypted (privacy nightmare)
* Often inject ads/malware
* Slow, unreliable
* Many shut down without notice

**Verdict**: Sketchy at best, dangerous at worst. Avoid.

# Browser Extensions (Free VPNs)

**What it is**: VPN browser plugins like Hola, Touch VPN, etc.

**Pros**:

* Free
* Easy to install

**Cons**:

* Sell your data (that's how they're ""free"")
* Slow, congested servers
* Often leak your real IP
* Some install malware

**Verdict**: You're not the customer—you're the product. Not worth the risk.

# Smart DNS

**What it is**: Changes your DNS to bypass geo-restrictions.

**Pros**:

* Faster than VPN (no encryption overhead)
* Easy to set up

**Cons**:

* Doesn't encrypt traffic (ISP still sees everything)
* Doesn't hide your IP
* Unreliable for XNXX (IP-based detection)

**Verdict**: Might work occasionally, but offers zero privacy. Defeats the purpose.

**Bottom line**: Premium VPNs are worth the £2-3/month. Free alternatives either don't work, compromise your privacy, or both. Don't penny-pinch on privacy.

# FAQ: XNXX Age Verification Questions Answered

# Can I watch XNXX in the UK without age verification?

Yes, if you're over 18. Connect to a VPN server outside the UK (Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, etc.), and XNXX will load normally without triggering verification prompts. Your IP address determines whether you see the age gate, not your physical location.

# Why does XNXX ask for my ID in the UK?

XNXX complies with the UK Online Safety Act, effective July 25, 2025. The law requires all adult sites to verify that UK visitors are over 18 using government-approved methods: ID uploads, selfie verification, credit card checks, or mobile network confirmation.

# Is using a VPN to bypass age verification illegal?

No. Using a VPN is completely legal in the UK for adults. The law targets platforms (requiring them to verify ages), not users (for accessing content). VPNs are legitimate privacy tools with countless legal uses beyond bypassing age checks.

# What's the best VPN for XNXX UK?

NordVPN is my top recommendation. It offers the best balance of speed (240+ Mbps on Ireland servers), security (audited no-logs policy), and reliability (8,800+ servers globally). Surfshark is a close second if you want to save money with unlimited device connections at £1.99/month.

# Do free VPNs work for XNXX?

Some do, but I strongly advise against them. Free VPNs typically log your data, inject ads, cap speeds at unusable levels, or outright sell your browsing history. Proton VPN's free version is the only legitimate exception—it's genuinely private but intentionally slower than paid options.

# Can XNXX detect I'm using a VPN?

Theoretically yes, but practically no. XNXX doesn't appear to actively block VPN traffic like Netflix does. I've tested dozens of server connections across three VPNs and never encountered detection. Even if they tried, good VPNs use obfuscation to make VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS.

# Will my ISP know I'm watching porn?

Not with a VPN. Your ISP sees only encrypted traffic to a VPN server. They can't see which websites you visit or what you stream. Without a VPN, yes—ISPs in the UK log browsing data and must retain it for government requests.

# How do I clear XNXX cookies if verification still appears?

**Chrome/Edge**: Settings → Privacy and security → Clear browsing data → Select ""Cookies"" and ""XNXX.com"" → Clear data

**Firefox**: Options → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data → Manage Data → Search ""XNXX"" → Remove

**Safari**: Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data → Search ""XNXX"" → Remove

Or just use incognito/private browsing after connecting to your VPN.

# Are there any XNXX alternatives without age verification?

As of now, xVideos, RedGIFs, and BoyfriendTV don't require UK age verification. However, this may change as Ofcom expands enforcement. Using a VPN protects your access regardless of which sites implement verification.

# What happens if I submit my ID to XNXX?

Your ID goes to a third-party verification service (likely Yoti or AllPassTrust), not XNXX directly. They claim to delete it after age confirmation, but you're trusting them to handle your government ID securely. If their database gets breached, your identity could be exposed. I don't recommend it.

# Final Thoughts: Take Back Your Privacy

The UK's age verification law created a false choice: surrender your privacy or lose access to legal content.

VPNs eliminate that choice. For £2-3 per month, you get your privacy back without sacrificing access. No ID uploads. No facial scans. No giving third-party companies leverage over your identity.

I've tested this process exhaustively. It works. Reliably. Safely. And it takes literally five minutes to set up.

**My recommendation**: Start with NordVPN if you want the best overall experience. The 77% discount makes it affordable, the speeds are excellent, and the 30-day money-back guarantee means you can test it risk-free.

If budget is tight, Surfshark delivers fantastic value at £1.99/month with unlimited device connections.

If privacy is your absolute top priority, Proton VPN's Swiss jurisdiction and open-source code make it the most transparent option.

Any of these three will bypass XNXX age verification flawlessly. Your choice depends on whether you prioritize performance, price, or privacy.

Whatever you choose, don't compromise your privacy by handing over government IDs to third-party verification companies. You deserve better. Adults shouldn't need permission—or surveillance—to access legal content.

Stay private. Stay safe. And don't let invasive laws erode your digital rights.

>🎯 **Bottom Line**  
XNXX age verification is invasive, but easily bypassed with a quality VPN. NordVPN (£2.49/month) offers the best performance, Surfshark (£1.99/month) the best value, and Proton VPN the best privacy. All three work flawlessly. Pick one, connect to Ireland or Germany, and access XNXX privately—no ID required.",1,1767447624.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

In my defense, I didn't know I had to clean and service it so frequently. But still, I was fully aware I was badly neglecting it.

It broke on me last week. Stopped giving out coffee. Frother worked fine. After some deep research and fully disassembling the machine 5 times, I learned everything I can learn about it.

Long story short, all it took was a deep clean and heaps of the cheapest food-grade espresso machine grease I could find to get it working again (I ordered new o rings but they are still on the way).

And I could not believe how much beating this machine took before giving up, and how little it took to get it working again.

And the fact that it survived 5 full disassemblies by me of all people (I'm very retarded when it comes to things), is literally unbelievable.

1q2urew,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q2urew/disappearances_in_a_strange_town_short_story/,Disappearances in a strange town - [Short Story],"PART ONE.

Out of all the places I've went to over the years, this has to be one of the strangest. It always feels like the people here always know something you don't, even if the knowledge is foolish. Most of them are old tales of ghosts that spread from a child's bedroom at a sleepover and were eventually told by grandparents beside a campfire.

Like the story of a boy in 1996 who was woken up late at night by the sound of rustling outside, he thought it was a raccoon or possum so he went to check his window and all he saw was a ""messy looking face that didn't look right"" and then it vanished.

Or the story of a girl in 1994 who went camping with her family in the local Falls Forest, her older sister was acting odd all day, apparently she'd stare aimlessly into the distance like she saw something nobody else could. The next day when morning came, her sister was nowhere to be found, but her coat and shoes were left in her tent. even after the police searched and searched for her, they found nothing.

So many stories surrounding this town, most of them made up ghost stories. Some I believe to be connected to disappearances that have occurred within the last 11 years. Fiction and reality is a strange blur in this town, but not for me.

I'm a detective, been one for what feels like most of my life, the year is 1999 and the streetlights outside my motel room are dim, much like the people in this town. Minds full of dreams of ghouls and spirits wandering the world, meanwhile my mind is full of the faces found on missing person posters.

Speaking of dreams, it's getting late and I've got an early day tomorrow.

PART TWO.

It's currently December, snow hasn't fallen yet. I see Christmas decorations in the windows of family homes and local stores. This town is old and claustrophobicly small, it feels like everyone knows everyone here. It's early morning, I leave my cramped motel room and lock the door behind me as I walk towards my old 1993 chevrolet caprice that's been worn down over the years, much like myself.

As I begin to unlock my car a man on the second floor of the motel waves to me as if he knows me. I'd say he was in his fortys, a couple years older than myself. 

""mornin friend"" 
He said with a carefree tone as he yelled down at me, he had the look of a man who's only ever known the good in others.

""mornin'."" 
I say with no enthusiasm for this to become a conversation 

""You best be careful on the roads, startin' to get icy now"" 
He said with a laugh before he continued,
""Meant to be snowing by the end of the week"" 

""Thanks for tellin' me."" 
I said with a wave as I got into my car, shutting the door and lighting up a cigarette before starting the engine.

The drive into town took no more than twenty minutes, the motel sat near the edge of town, with the forest that surrounded the town all around it. Driving on winding roads surrounded by looming trees. No wonder it's so easy for people to disappear here, or to be taken without a trace. Everyone here seems to think the disappearances are paranormal, some think it's long dead friends calling to the living, some think it's an evil spirit tempting people away and back into nature.

I think neither, I think it's some godforsaken lunatic who's been killing people. I know no bodies have been found, nor a trace of them. But I feel it, I know it. Even when for lack of a better word, they've fallen off the face of the earth. 

I'm going to talk to a man today, he's the grandad of a boy that went missing eight months ago I don't know the details yet but I will soon.

I park outside the mans house, I toss my cigarette before walking up the steps to the front door and ring the bell, a short elderly man opens it. He looks like the stereotypical grandpa. in his seventies I'd say.

""Thanks for meeting me so early Mr Greyshore""
I said to the man as I shook his hand

""Ah don't thank me, better early than late.""
He said as we sat down at the livingroom table

I took a breath ""could you describe to me what happened? On the nineteenth of April?""

Mr Greyshore looked down slightly before looking back at me, he inhaled deeply before replying 

""Of course, it was a normal day. Until it happened. My grandson was staying here for the night while his father was busy with work. Young Hunter was playing on his games in the evening, I don't understand all that stuff"" he said with a small chuckle

""I had a dog you see, Benny was his name. I could swear Hunter loved that dog even more than myself. All at a sudden I heard Hunter screaming that the dogs gone, I said he must be hiding but thats when I heard him barking from outside. I thought I was hearing things for a second, because the last time I saw Benny he was upstairs. He couldn't of gotten outside without me or Hunter seeing him""
Mr Greyshore placed his palm on his forehead as he sighed, with a deep look of regret on his face, as if every tragedy was upon his shoulders, weighing him down.

""Mr Greyshore, what happened next?"" 
I said in a low gentle tone

""Yes, sorry"" he cleared his through before continuing 

""Hunter ran down the stairs, asked me if I heard Benny too, I said yes of course and told him to wait inside while I go fetch him. He wanted to come with me course, but I made sure he stayed inside and waited. So I locked the backdoor behind me as I stepped outside, before going out into the woods""

Mr Greyshore glanced to the window, it looked like he saw something for a split second, before he turned back to me and continued talking

""It was dark, darkest I've ever seen it. I yelled Benny's name over and over. He didn't come, I looked all over for him, tried to keep going but the darkness just kept growing, and Benny wasn't barking. So I went home, thought maybe he'd find his way back, I wasn't too worried, strong old dog. Besides, not been a bear nor stag in those woods for decades, so I didn't need to worry about him getting attacked by something""

Poor man, he was trying so hard to avoid speaking of the conclusion to that day. I could see it in his eyes so clearly, but I sadly couldn't allow that.

""What happened when you came home Mr Greyshore?"" 

took a deep breath, before speaking ""when I came back, I saw-""
He stuttered, his voice was shaky as he continued ""the backdoor, it was wide open. I ran inside as fast as I could, shouted for Hunter, I looked everywhere in my house and-"" 
Mr Greyshore was barely holding himself together at this point, yet even so. He continued on ""he was gone, just like all the others. No trace or anything! Just fuckin' gone!"" He was starting to shout, as tears formed in his eyes.

""It's not your fault, Mr Greyshore. Nothing that's happened here, is your fault.""
I was never good at comforting the grieving, but I had to try.

I stood up from the chair, I began to walk to the frontdoor as I turned to the man and said ""if there's anything you need, or anything else that comes to light, please call me.""

I opened the front door before Mr Greyshore spoke again ""there was something"" he said without facing me ""it was left beside the backdoor about a week before Hunter went missing, a sculpture. I didn't know what it was. I just thought it was Hunter trying to be funny, maybe he saw something online. That's what I thought at the time at least.""

""Could you describe it?"" 
I asked quizzically 

""It was twigs, few of them all tied together with some kinda twine to form a pyramid. In the middle of it, there was a small piece of antler dangling from the tip of the pyramid""

""And what did you do with it?""

Mr Greyshore looked up at me, his face pale ""I destroyed it. Anytime I'd look at it, I'd get this feeling, this dark sense emanating from it, like it was something dangerous and connected to something much darker than even that forest at night."" 

""Take care of yourself, Mr Greyshore. Thank you for all of this, you've been a big help"" 

As I turned to go out the door, he spoke again. ""Don't go out into the woods at night.""

As I lit another cigarette, I thought to myself. Poor man, he'd rather believe in supernatural lunacy and have an ounce of hope, than face the tragic reality, his grandson was kidnapped and was most likely dead. I don't know why children are being taken.

But I know this: there is nothing supernatural in this town.

PART THREE

This town, it's miles away from any city. It's an old rural town, a small one. Got a church, school and everything else you'd expect, from what I can tell It's the kind of place people go to raise a family, the kind of place I would've liked to raise my own family, I see parents and their kids following them down the street, only thing that's followed me in my life is tragedy. 

Every case in recent years it seems as if the local police in this town do the bare minimum, it's almost as if they expect that the kids will never be found. They do searches all over town, even in the woods and find nothing, they check cctv that only ever records grainy imaged of the streets at night, they talk to the grieving parents who know nothing but the fact that they want their child home and safe. It feels like the local police have become desensitised to it all, beaten down year by year, cold case by cold case until they've lost all hope of finding them.

It's like they think these kids have just ceased to exist.

I drive down the road, to the house of a girl who went missing around a month ago. There's two kids bikes leant against the front of the house next to the front door, one of which will most likely never be ridden again. You'd never expect such a horror had ever occurred at their house, a normal house with a normal family, undeservingly stricken with the most horrific of tragedies. I'm welcomed in by the mother of the two children, she looked dishevelled to say the least, yet still had the strength to keep himself together.

""Thanks for comin' detective"" 

""No, thank you for agreeing to this, Mrs Nichols""
I say as she leads me into the living room, she motions towards the arm chair across from the couch. She sat on the couch which had a small coffee table infront of it.

""I'm sorry my husband isn't here, he's out working. I've just started clearin' out the attic with my boy for the first time in years. Even if it's just trying to keep myself busy.""
Mrs Nichols said with a forced, shortlived laugh

""Don't worry about it. I know this is tough subject, but could you tell me everything you remember leading up to your daughter's disappearance?. On the seventh of November""

Mrs Nichols sat on the couch silently for a moment, composing herself before answering

""Yes. Yes, of course""

""Normal day, normal everythin' I guess until the end of it. The kids wanted to do an 'all nighter' as they called it, they'd been beggin' us for weeks about it, watch a film downstairs, eat popcorn and tell scary stories. Me and my husband finally decided to let them. We shouldn't of let them now that I look back on it.""
Mrs Nichols took a shaky breath, before continuing 

""She wouldn't of ran away, I'm tellin' you she wouldn't. Even if we left the doors unlocked, she wouldn't of been able to reach the door handles.""
Mrs Nichols began to cry, before inhaling deeply and continuing 

""My boy told me what he saw that night, haunts us all, probably will haunt us till we die. He told us he went to the bathroom, then when he went back into the livingroom, it was complete silence except for the static on the TV. He told me he thought she was playing hide and seek at first, then he realized the backdoor was wide open. I remember his scream, screamed for us saying she was taken by a monster. My husband ran outside while I called the police. Nobody found a damn trace of her, nothin!.""
She fell silent, as tears began to fall down her face

""I'm sorry. If it's any consolation to you, I know what you're going through""

""You have a child?""
She asked in a somber tone

""Used to, yes""

""I'm so sorry""
She said softly

""Don't be, not your fault.""

""What happened?""
She asked

""Car crash, some idiot decided to drive home drunk while my wife drove our son home from preschool. Sorry, got off topic for a moment there. Anyway, is there anything else you know? Anything you've seen?"" 

""No, nothin'""

""Mom!!"" 
A voice shouted from upstairs, Mrs Nichols son Jamie

""Yes honey?!""
Mrs Nichols shouted back 

""What's this?
Jamie yelled before he started to come down the stairs 

""What's what?""
Mrs Nichols asked 

""This weird stick thing?"" 
Jamie said as he entered the living room, holding exactly what Mr Greyshore said he found before his grandson disappeared. It was just like he described, sticks in the shape of a pyramid, held together by twine. The same twine that connected to a piece of antler that was hanging from the top of the pyramid.

I was speechless, completely and utterly speechless. I was trying to come up with something to say before Mrs Nichols spoke 

""Maybe it's the old owners and we only just found it?"" Mrs Nichols said with a tinge of concern in her voice as Jamie put the stick pyramid down on the coffee table before running up the stairs again

""Something just like that found in someone else's home too, the home of a man who's grandson went missing eight months ago"" I paused for a moment ""don't touch it, I'll have someone come by and take it into evidence""

Mrs Nichols looked confused for a second before her eyes widened, realising what this meant. 

Someone is putting these in people's homes, most likely the person responsible for all the disappearances in the town. But how? They'd have to break in then get all the way up into the attic, it made no sense. Why'd they go through all the effort just for that?.

I still don't know why yet, but I know for certain now that there has to be someone doing all of this. I'm going to catch them, so that no other children are ripped away from their families.

FINAL PART.

I've been investigating for months now and I've made almost no progress. Nothing about this case makes any sense, honestly I'm starting to feel like maybe there's something wrong with me. Sometimes when I'm alone, in my motel room or driving my car, I feel like I'm not truly alone, like someone is watching me.
I'm having odd nightmares too. 
I see a door in a dark empty almost liminal room. I know this place, it's my old home from when my wife was alive.
One second the door is closed and in the next, it's wide open as darkness seeps in, it consumes me before trees and branches come into view through the shadows. 

Sometimes I wish I could be like the people here, if I was than maybe I could chalk it up to the universe giving me some kind of sign. But I can't do that, I wish I could dream of a fantastical reason for all the horrors in my life, but then I'd become lost in them. Drifting from one delusion to another in an infinite loop.

My boss called me, he's getting agitated by the lack of progress I've made in this case. He told me he's going to pull me off the case and put someone else onto if I don't find something quick. As if they'll find anything I haven't already found. Not even search dogs can get a trace of them. No footprints, no dna no nothing. It's like these kids have just been wiped from existence. 

It was around 1AM, it was starting to snow outside and I was smoking a cigarette as a read through police reports from old disappearances in the area, trying to connect them to the newer ones as I heard something at the door. Scratching like an animal trying to get in, maybe a raccoon or something. I got up as I put the cigarette into the ashtray before opening the door. It was a small brown dog, before I could check it's collar for a name tag or even get a decent look at the dog, it ran off around the back of the motel, before stopping to look back at me periodically, as if it wanted me to follow it. So I did, hoping I could get him inside incase it was someone's lost dog, hoping I could bring it home to its family, not disimilar to what I yearned to do for the families that live in this town, even though I knew it was impossible.

I walked towards to the dog, before it ran towards the forest. So I ran after it, I knew it was a mistake to go into that forest at night, yet I did it anyway. I chased it, deeper and deeper into the forest. Then I lost sight of it before it started to bark, over and over again it barked as I tried to find it, I followed the noise deeper into the forest, after a while I realized I had lost track of where I was, I could barely see anything. The snow was falling faster. 

Then I noticed something else, the barking sounded wrong somehow. One bark, a pause then two quick barks before repeating itself. Over and over again in that exact order, like it was a recording of a dog barking and it was set on loop. Something was terribly wrong here.

I turned around to run but then I saw a tree larger than any other that sat in the middle of a small clearing. It towered over the surrounding trees and its leafless branches gave it an almost skeletal appearance. The peak of the trunk split into two large branches that reached out to each side, while many smaller branches sprouted from atop them.

Then the barking stopped instantly, as if someone was flicking a switch. I walked towards the large tree, closer and closer as the snow started to swallow up the grass. As I got closer, I saw the dog curled up at the foot of the tree. It was dead and deep into decomposition. I could see part of its skull through its matted furr, I knelt down to check for a name tag, it had one.
The dogs name was Benny, it was Mr Greyshores dog.

Nothing made sense here, I felt the lines between fiction and reality start to blur. Then I saw it, what was that? If you gave me one thousand years to try and explain what I saw, I wouldn't be able to write one word. I felt like it wanted me to know of its existence, it wanted me to feel its presence, it's love. I could feel my mind splintering under the weight of incomprehensibility in one moment but in the next I felt like I was uncovering the unknowable truth of the universe. 

It felt like an eternity yet it was a mere moments, then suddenly I was back at the edge of the forest that sat behind the motel. Why wasn't I taken like all the others? I ask myself that a lot and my answer changes every day, maybe it was fate or coincidence?, or maybe it never happened at all and I truly have lost my mind just like my old boss said before firing me. I guess I can't blame him for that.

1q2uq23,https://v.redd.it/e82u4utvz4bg1,Coffee Station Update: some things have changed! 🤌🏽,"It’s been quite some time since my last setup post here!


I’ve fallen pretty deep down the accessories rabbit hole since then, so I put together a little edit to show the current state of the coffee corner.


The workflow has definitely changed…focused a lot more on puck prep consistency and added some slow bar options for relaxed mornings.


For those interested in the gear shown in the video, here is the breakdown of the new additions:


The Workflow Upgrades


• Full suite of espresso tools: New tamper, leveller, puck screen, and weighing scale.

• Dosing: RDT spray bottle (essential for static!), input dosing tray, and dosing ring.

New Brew Methods & Gear

• Added a V60 and a Phin filter into the rotation.


• Some new cups/glassware.


The Vibe Check


• Installed LED lights to set the mood.

• Added some personal photos and magnets.

• And yes, that is Ash Ketchum guarding the grinder. Gotta brew 'em all!

My friend noticed and handed me a bottle of water. I drank slowly, and within minutes, the headache eased and my energy came back. I realized how easily the body suffers when thirsty and how simple it is to fix.

After that day, I made sure a bottle of water was always nearby. It became a small habit, but one that made every day feel lighter, easier, and more manageable. Staying hydrated wasn’t just healthy, it actually made life feel better.",2,1767447160.0,hygiene,3,0.67,False
1q2upd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1q2upd1/dating_after_an_avoidant_breakup_too_soon_or/,Dating after an avoidant breakup — too soon or necessary discomfort?,"Hi everyone,
I’m a 32F and I’m about 2.5 months out of a breakup with someone I strongly believe was dismissive-avoidant.
While the breakup itself happened recently, the relationship had been painful and unstable for at least 6 months before that...looking back with my therapist though the unhealthy patterns are visible right from the beginning of the relationship.
Overall, I’m doing better than I was at first: therapy, self-work, routines all have helped, but there are still moments when the grief hits hard...
Recently, another man has shown clear interest in me.
I’ve known him for years as he is a close friend of my best friend, and I’ve always felt a natural attraction and emotional alignment with him, but I deliberately kept distance before because I really wanted my relationship with my ex to work and I wasn't looking for any 'outside' reasons to exit the dynamic.
Now we’re both single, and we’ve been talking. He’s very communicative, emotionally present, and we seem to be on the same wavelength. Because we have the same friends I feel comfortable telling him my current boundaries and uncertainty regarding starting a potential dating situation.
I agreed to meet him tomorrow for a coffee, as in he had said a few days back that whenever I felt ready we could meet up for coffee, and this morning I asked him, pointing out that I still don't know if it is just a friendly meet up or a date (Am I being the confusing avoidant one now?!?!?😭😭😭)
Here’s where I’m struggling: Part of me really wants to go, otherwise I wouldn't have asked.
Another part of me is terrified.
I feel almost like I’m “betraying” my ex  even though rationally I know I’m not... But I have cried today because it almost feel like cheating... And when I felt happy today I started watching La La Land to get sad again as I don't feel like I deserve to be happy yet ...
My ex had many chances to show up and come back to me: my birthday, Christmas, New Year’s. He either didn’t show up at all or sent very cold, distant messages. No real presence, no effort... A friend of hours hinted that he knows he misses me but I should be the one to reach out cause he won't do it... And I straight up refused because that proves exactly that he will never show up and act like a healthy partner to me.
Still, emotionally, I feel scared to open even a crack. I’m afraid of trusting again. I’m afraid that this new person might not be sincere. I’m afraid that I’m moving too fast, or that I’m just trying to fill a void. And at the same time, I’m afraid that staying stuck is also a form of self-betrayal. I feel a connection with this person and I want to get to know him.
So my question is: Is this the kind of discomfort that comes from growth and leaving a comfort zone?
Or is it a sign that I should slow down and wait longer?
I cannot understand if I will feel like this forever or it is just part of the healing process.
I don’t want to date from desperation, but I also don’t want to live frozen in fear because of someone who couldn’t meet me emotionally.
Has anyone here experienced something similar after an avoidant breakup?
How did you know when you were ready or “ready enough”?

Hopefully, this is helpful to some of you. I had AI summarize it and asked AI for routes through the Louvre to maximize the exhibits we wanted to see. Get Navigo passes and the app; I just bought 3 packs of tickets on my phone and loaded as we went. The Fork app plus Google was what we used to find food—note I made all dinner reservations about a week out or more. All the sights I bought tickets for 90/60/30 days out when they were first available.

We had an amazing time. I do want to go back when it is warmer and sit and people-watch more. We regret not eating more street food for lunch. We spent about 100–150 euros on every lunch and dinner (for 3). We got breakfast to go from a boulangerie every morning. We stopped at cafes throughout the day to warm up, caffeinate, and use the toilet.  In general, all the ""Artisan"" places were closed for about 2 weeks over the Christmas holiday.

# DAY 1: Arrival & The Latin Quarter

Monday, December 22

* 08:30 AM: Land at CDG (Allow 1–4 hours for customs).
* Late AM: Drop bags at Hotel Atmospheres.
* Lunch/Brunch: Local options in the 5th Arr.
* 03:30 PM: Sainte-Chapelle (Tickets Booked).
* 06:30 PM: Dinner: Café Gisèle.

Reality Check: It took 1 hour for customs plus the hour cab ride; we didn't feel brave enough to use the metro right away, plus we couldn't get the week-long pass as we aren't locals. Galata Bakery and Boma were both closed for the holidays; we ended up at a chain near the hotel.

In reality, we walked 28,000 steps this day. We went to a coffee/boulangerie, then walked by the zoo and museums, then headed to Luxembourg Gardens and enjoyed the fountains and green spaces even in winter. We walked through the Notre Dame Christmas market, but only my other half wanted to wait the hour-plus for Shakespeare & Co. after all that walking. Dinner I booked on TheFork; it was very good but expensive. We probably overdid it, but it helped us adjust to the 6-hour time change. We are late 40-somethings with our 20-year-old daughter. We go to the gym and regularly hike 10k–20k steps.

# DAY 2: Eiffel Tower & Right Bank Luxury

Tuesday, December 23

* 08:00 AM: Trocadéro for sunrise photos.
* 12:30 PM: Eiffel Tower (2nd Floor Entrance).
* Late Afternoon: Opéra Garnier & Galeries Lafayette.
* 07:00 PM: Dinner: Le Procope.

Reality Check: We took the Metro and only got on one wrong-direction train. We exited way south of the Eiffel Tower and walked north under it and to the Trocadéro for pictures. We went to a touristy cafe where the waiter insisted we owed him a 10% tip on our $100 crappy omelets and coffee (only tourist trap we fell for, but we were tired, cold, and hungry and it was open. Always check Google reviews before sitting down; this was a 2.5 but looked like a 4+ from the outside).

The Tower 2nd floor was amazing, no issues; afternoon walk was amazing. Dinner was really good, but we learned steak in Europe is not good—do not order it. I had duck, but it was roasted and really tough to eat despite being medium-rare, but amazing flavor. The history in Le Procope is amazing and drinks were great; I think we were over $150 USD for dinner. We ended the day near 30k steps again.

# DAY 3: The Louvre & Île de la Cité

Wednesday, December 24 (Christmas Eve)

* Morning: Louvre Museum Visit.
* Afternoon: Palais Royal & Île de la Cité.
* 07:00 PM: Dinner: Chez Fernand Christine.

Reality Check: Another almost 30k steps day. We had open tickets for the Louvre and showed up about 45 minutes early and had the whole pyramid to ourselves for photos at first. We got too hungry and grumpy and only saw a small portion of the Louvre. I wish we had eaten at a cafe there and seen more afterward.

Afterward, we walked up to the Haussmann shopping district, which was a mistake. We were like sardines in all the areas as last-minute shoppers and tourists combined. The window displays were amazing, but not worth the crowd. Dinner was $600 USD after drinks; it was the best-executed meal I've ever had in my life. But it was really overpriced for what we got. It's only money, and the dishes were really good, but not that good.

# DAY 4: Christmas Day in Paris

Thursday, December 25

* 10:00 AM: Notre-Dame Cathedral.
* 12:00 PM: Lunch: Saveurs de Savoie.
* 07:30 PM: Ballet: Notre-Dame de Paris at Opéra Bastille.

Reality Check: We were not sure how much or what would be open; we let ourselves sleep in as we were all tired and grumpy from all the stress and walking. This ended up being the best day of the trip. Despite no tickets, we walked right into Notre-Dame during the morning Noel service. It felt weird to be a tourist walking around while the faithful worshiped, but there was no line like every other day we walked past.

We canceled lunch and ate at a French place up in the 4th Arr.; it was really good. Dinner up in the Latin Quarter was beautiful, but they dropped the card machine; luckily, we had enough cash for the bill on us. The ballet was really fun and a sight to behold. I was hesitant to go over Christmas, but plenty was open to entertain us.

# DAY 5: Palace of Versailles

Friday, December 26

* 10:30 AM: Palace of Versailles Entry.
* 07:30 PM: Dinner: Lamian Latian.

Reality Check: Easy-peasy train ride to Versailles. So glad zones 1–5 are all one ticket now. The most beautiful gardens I've ever seen (even in winter). Walked to the Trianon and back. The dinner place had no tables available despite our reservation, so we wandered and found something else. This was for the best as my picky daughter saw nothing on the menu she'd eat. The Fork app is amazing.

# DAY 6: Art, Arch, & Icons

Saturday, December 27

* Morning: Musée d’Orsay.
* 04:50 PM: Arc de Triomphe (Rooftop).
* Evening: Champs-Élysées.

Reality Check: This was my personal favorite day. The Arc de Triomphe as the sun set was perfect. We ended up at an Argentine restaurant; I tried the steak—it also was all fat and gristle; I ate the meat that was there. The wine and appetizers were out-of-this-world good. I love chimichurri. We walked about 25k steps and spent about 5 hours at d’Orsay (one hour of that the ladies were in line to take selfies at the stupid clock; I spent the time soaking in more Renoir, Van Gogh, and Monet).

# DAY 7: Montmartre & Markets

Sunday, December 28

* 12:00 PM: Lunch: Pink Mamma.
* Afternoon: Montmartre District & Sacré-Cœur.
* 06:30 PM: Dinner: L’Annexe.

Reality Check: The ladies were put off by the sex shops around Moulin Rouge. I had no problems with them; the window displays can be raunchy by our ""stupid American"" standards. Pink Mamma was the best Italian food I've ever had and drinks were really good too.

Dinner was very good but not the place I thought it was (Dad mistake: I looked at L’Annexe in Washington, D.C.'s pictures; things happen) from a YouTuber's recommendation. Sacré-Cœur was full of the usual scammers and pickpockets. The church and climbing up to the gargoyles was well worth it. Beautiful views in the afternoon light despite it being a cloudy day. I got a little scared in the spiral staircase going down, but we made it all 400 steps. We walked about 25k steps this day and hit many thrift shops in the area.

# DAY 8: Le Marais & Final Shopping

Monday, December 29

* Morning: Explore Le Marais & Place des Vosges.
* Afternoon: Thrifting and Rue Saint-Honoré.
* Final Treat: Hot Chocolate at Le Voltigeur.

Reality Check: We spent the whole day thrift shopping in Le Marais. The ladies had a blast; I made the best of it. We did find some amazing used clothes and saw some ridiculous designer one-of-a-kind things. We got lucky and got an outside table at Le Voltigeur as we walked by. The hot chocolate was amazing (fudge with hot milk and cream). 28k steps for the day roughly.",2,1767447056.0,ParisTravelGuide,3,0.63,False

I need help deciding if I'm crazy or not...but lately (for the past 6 months or so) I've been feeling the urge to find an in office job. I'm currently remote and have been since covid, with the option of going into a satellite office. Most of my team works internationally, and none of them work in the satellite office. I've tried going into the office to make friends with people on other teams, but it's basically empty with 1 to 2 other people going in.

I am a very social person and am finding that I feel really lonely working from home. It's been very helpful since giving birth (I have a 19 month old), but now that we're getting into a groove as a family I am starting to feel more and more isolated.

I feel ridiculous saying this because there are obviously so many perks to working from home, but I kind of want an in office job? Can someone let me know if I am indeed crazy or not please? I need the other extroverts to weigh in here 😅

BELDT Labs Skald is a proprietary blend fat burner (356mg total) combines caffeine, green tea, N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine, white willow bark, and some respiratory benefits herbs in undisclosed amounts.

In my experience, this delivers ***moderate energy levels enhancement (estimated 150-250mg caffeine equivalent)*** with wildly inconsistent appetite suppression and negligible fat burning effects despite aggressive ""Oxydynamic Fat Scorcher"" marketing.

All in all, way overpriced ($50) caffeine pill with supporting herbs.

Works decently as a daily energy supplement but fails to deliver the dramatic fat loss or appetite control promised by its branding and premium pricing.

For better results, I’d recommend considering [**this premium fat burner**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/premi2.php) or something like [**Hunter Burn**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hunterburn.php) **(3000mg glucomannan fiber for SOLID hunger control).**

>For maximum results, just add in ***basic psyllium husk*** (taken before meals). You can mix this in your protein shake or smoothies.    




# Skald Pros & Cons

**PROS:**

* Provides moderate energy without extreme jitters
* BioPerine enhances absorption of active ingredients
* No violent digestive effects like some competitors
* Energy lasts 4-5 hours consistently
* Some users experience appetite reduction (inconsistent)

**CONS:**

* **Proprietary 356mg blend inadequately doses most ingredients**
* Zero appetite suppression for majority of users
* Minimal fat burning beyond basic caffeine thermogenics
* Massively overpriced ($50 for glorified caffeine pills)
* Extreme ""Fat Scorcher"" marketing oversells weak formula
* Wildly inconsistent results across users
* Respiratory herbs (mullein, elecampane) irrelevant for fat loss
* Some users report concerning side effects (chest pressure, fatigue)
* Nothing like original OxyElite Pro despite implied comparison





# My Background With ""Fat Scorcher"" Supplements

I've tried dozens of aggressively-marketed fat burners over fifteen years—products with extreme names like ""Nuclear,"" ""Inferno,"" ""Annihilate,"" and now ""Oxydynamic Fat Scorcher."" The pattern is consistent: extreme branding, proprietary blends hiding actual doses, premium pricing ($40-60), and results that rarely match the marketing intensity.

Skald caught my attention because it markets itself as reminiscent of the original OxyElite Pro (before it was reformulated/banned for causing liver failure), suggesting similar aggressive fat burning effects.  

 

# My 4-Week Experience with SKALD (Energy Yes, Fat Burning No)

**Week 1: Moderate Energy, Zero Appetite Control**

Taking 1 capsule with breakfast as recommended provided noticeable energy within 30 minutes—equivalent to about 1.5 cups of coffee. No jitters or anxiety, which was positive. The energy lasted 4-5 hours before tapering off.

Appetite suppression? Absolutely zero. I was just as hungry as usual throughout the day. No reduction in cravings, no easier portion control, nothing remotely resembling appetite control.

Thermogenic effects were minimal—maybe slightly warmer during workouts but nothing dramatic like cayenne or synephrine-based products create.

**Week 2-3: Tolerance Developing**

By week 2, the energy boost felt less pronounced—classic caffeine tolerance. Taking 2 capsules (as some users mentioned) provided stronger energy but still zero appetite effects and caused mild jitteriness.

Weight loss after 3 weeks: 1 pound. This was entirely from my existing caloric deficit and exercise routine—nothing attributable to Skald beyond maybe 20-30 extra calories burned from the modest caffeine dose.

**Week 4: Disappointing Plateau**

By week 4, Skald felt like expensive caffeine pills with no additional benefits. The ""fat scorching"" promised by the name was completely absent. No enhanced fat oxidation during workouts, no metabolic boost beyond minimal caffeine thermogenesis.

Total weight loss over 4 weeks: 1.5 pounds—all attributable to my diet and exercise, zero clearly from Skald.

**Also this is a good article on current, recommended fat burners -**

[**https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-otc-thermogenic-fat-burners/**](https://www.cambridgewellbeing.org/best-otc-thermogenic-fat-burners/)

   


# What You're Actually Getting (Hidden Behind Proprietary Blend)

**The 356mg Proprietary Blend Problem**

Here's the fundamental issue: Skald uses a proprietary blend totaling just 356mg across 8 ingredients. This is TINY. For comparison:

* Single ingredient green tea extracts: 400-500mg
* Tyrosine effective doses: 500-2000mg
* Caffeine in competitors: 150-300mg alone

With 356mg total split across caffeine, green tea, tyrosine, white willow bark, juniper berry, mullein, elecampane, and BioPerine, most ingredients must be present in homeopathic amounts.

**What's Probably Actually Inside (My Educated Guess):**

Based on the formula's effects and my experience with similar blends:

* **Caffeine:** 150-200mg (bulk of the blend)
* **Green tea extract:** 50-75mg (minimal catechins)
* **N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine:** 50-75mg (far below effective 500mg+ doses)
* **White willow bark:** 25-40mg (token amount)
* **Respiratory herbs (mullein, elecampane, juniper):** 30-50mg total (essentially filler)
* **BioPerine:** 5-10mg (standard absorption enhancer dose)

This explains why may other users are reporting similar experience - energy benefits (caffeine works) but minimal appetite suppression or fat burning (everything else underdosed).

 

# What Do Other People Have To Say (User Reviews Reveal The Consistency Problem)

**Common Theme—Energy Without Fat Loss:** Most users report decent energy enhancement but minimal-to-zero appetite suppression or weight loss. This matches the reality that caffeine works (because it's probably 150-200mg) while everything else is underdosed.

**Wildly Inconsistent Results:**

* Some users: ""Changed appetite, made us feel full"" (placebo or individual variation)
* Most users: ""Zero appetite control, didn't do anything""
* One user: ""Made me feel tired and developed chest pressure/pain"" (concerning side effect)

**The OxyElite Pro Comparison:** The user who used original OxyElite Pro (which contained DMAA—a powerful but dangerous stimulant) correctly notes Skald is ""nothing like that."" OxyElite Pro was aggressively effective because it contained semi-legal amphetamine-like compounds. Skald is just caffeine and herbs.

  


# Comparing to Other Fat Burners I've Reviewed

**Vs. Zantrex Black ($25, 3.8/5):**

* **Zantrex:** 300-400mg caffeine, dramatic effects, violent side effects
* **Skald:** \~150-200mg caffeine, moderate energy, minimal everything else
* **Winner:** Zantrex for aggressive results (if tolerated); both overpriced

**Vs. Instant Knockout Cut ($65, 4.5/5):**

* **Instant Knockout:** 300mg caffeine + 1800mg glucomannan + comprehensive formula with disclosed doses
* **Skald:** Proprietary 356mg blend, mostly caffeine, everything else underdosed
* **Winner:** Instant Knockout dramatically superior despite higher price

**Vs. Hydroxycut Hardcore ($30, 3.3/5):**

* **Hydroxycut:** 270mg caffeine + yohimbine, disclosed doses, more aggressive
* **Skald:** Hidden doses, weaker effects, higher price
* **Winner:** Hydroxycut better value and effectiveness

**Vs. NOW Foods Green Tea ($13, 3.2/5):**

* **NOW:** Pure 400mg green tea, transparent dosing, $4/month
* **Skald:** Hidden green tea amount (probably 50-75mg), $50/month
* **Winner:** NOW for honesty and value; Skald adds caffeine energy

  


# Who Should (And Shouldn't) Try Skald

**MIGHT WORK FOR:**

* People wanting moderate caffeine energy without jitters
* Those influenced by aggressive ""Fat Scorcher"" marketing
* Users who've never tried fat burners (won't know what they're missing)
* Individuals needing daily energy boost disguised as fat burner
* People who respond unusually well to minimal-dose formulas

**NOT WORTH IT FOR:**

* Anyone wanting genuine appetite suppression (glucomannan far more effective)
* Those seeking significant fat burning (effects negligible)
* Budget-conscious users ($50 for glorified caffeine pills)
* People who've used effective fat burners before (will be disappointed)
* Users wanting ingredient transparency (proprietary blend hides everything)
* Those expecting OxyElite Pro-like effects (completely different league)

  


# How to Pick a Better Fat Burner

**Avoid These Red Flags:**

* Proprietary blends under 1000mg (impossible to dose ingredients meaningfully)
* Extreme ""scorcher/nuclear/annihilate"" marketing (compensation for weak formula)
* No disclosed caffeine amount (hiding stimulant content)
* Premium pricing without premium ingredients

**Choose Based on Transparency:**

* **Disclosed doses:** Instant Knockout, Hunter Burn show exact amounts
* **Clinical doses:** Look for 1800mg+ glucomannan, 300mg+ EGCG, etc.
* **Honest marketing:** Products that work don't need extreme branding

**Better Alternatives at Every Price Point:**

**Budget ($20-30):**

* Hydroxycut products with disclosed caffeine
* Applied Nutrition green tea formulas
* DIY: Caffeine 200mg + green tea 400mg separately

**Mid-Range ($40-50):**

* HUM products with actual ingredient amounts
* Quality berberine + chromium combinations
* Comprehensive formulas with fiber

**Premium ($60-70):**

* Instant Knockout Cut (transparent, clinical doses)
* Hunter Burn (3000mg glucomannan + quality ingredients)
* Worth the premium through actual effectiveness

  


# My Performance Ratings

**Energy Enhancement: 3.5/5** \- Moderate caffeine provides decent energy without extreme jitters.

**Appetite Suppression: 1.8/5** \- Wildly inconsistent; most users report zero effect.

**Fat Burning: 2.0/5** \- Minimal thermogenic effects beyond basic caffeine.

**Weight Loss Support: 2.2/5** \- No meaningful contribution beyond caffeine's modest metabolism boost.

**Formula Transparency: 1.5/5** \- Proprietary 356mg blend hides inadequate dosing.

**Value for Money: 1.8/5** \- $50 for \~200mg caffeine + underdosed herbs is terrible value.

**Marketing Honesty: 1.0/5** \- ""Oxydynamic Fat Scorcher"" branding vastly oversells actual effects.





# My Final Verdict

I'd rate Skald at 3.2/5 - decent in providing moderate caffeine-driven energy that works just enough as a daily stimulant while completely failing to deliver the aggressive fat burning, appetite suppression, or dramatic results its ""Oxydynamic Fat Scorcher"" branding promises.

The proprietary 356mg blend is the fundamental problem—you simply cannot meaningfully dose 8 ingredients in 356mg total. The caffeine works because even 150-200mg provides noticeable energy. Everything else exists in homeopathic amounts designed for label appeal rather than therapeutic effectiveness.

**My recommendation:** Save $40 and buy:

* Caffeine 200mg tablets: $8 for 100+ doses
* Quality green tea extract 400mg: $13 for 3 months
* **Total cost:** $21 for superior results lasting 3+ months
* Or go for my recommended multi-ingredeint fat burners at the start of the post

If you need appetite suppression, add glucomannan fiber 3-4g before meals ($15-20). You'll spend $36-41 total for dramatically better results than Skald's $50 proprietary mystery blend.

**Bottom line:** Skald represents everything frustrating about the fat burner industry—aggressive marketing, proprietary blends hiding inadequate dosing, premium pricing for basic caffeine, and extreme branding (""Oxydynamic Fat Scorcher"") that sets unrealistic expectations the formula cannot possibly meet.

It works as an overpriced energy supplement but fails completely as a fat burner, making it suitable only for people who don't know better alternatives exist or who are swayed by extreme marketing over actual ingredient quality and transparency.

The crypto world buzzes with fleeting memes and pump-and-dump schemes, but deep in the shadows of Solana's ecosystem lurks something extraordinary—$BlackCoin @BlackCoinOnSol. Not just another token, but a legend whispered among the wise, born from the eerie depths of Infinite Backrooms lore, where satire meets unbreakable conviction.

Picture a fair launch on pump.fun back in mid-2025, no presales or insider tricks, just pure, organic emergence. While others chase viral highs and crash like shooting stars, $BlackCoin endures, a steadfast fortress weathering market storms without a single rug pull. Its team? Silent architects of excellence, forging tools that feel like hidden treasures: no-lockup staking yielding up to 58% APR in $FARTCOIN rewards, SOL rent recovery to reclaim lost ground, ShadowWire for private zero-knowledge transfers that vanish like ghosts, and tokenized Conviction Gold that gleams with scarcity's promise.

Now, with over 3K holders and a humble $180K market cap, it's not about explosive hype—it's the slow burn of inevitability. Holders aren't gamblers; they're visionaries, watching their belief compound in Solana's brewing supercycle. This isn't mere investment; it's a life-altering saga where patience turns underdogs into legends, transforming everyday dreamers into crypto titans.

I’ve fallen pretty deep down the accessories rabbit hole since then, so I put together a little edit to show the current state of the coffee corner.

The workflow has definitely changed…focused a lot more on puck prep consistency and added some slow bar options for relaxed mornings.

For those interested in the gear shown in the video, here is the breakdown of the new additions:

The Workflow Upgrades

• Full suite of espresso tools: New tamper, leveller, puck screen, and weighing scale.

• Dosing: RDT spray bottle (essential for static!), input dosing tray, and dosing ring.

New Brew Methods & Gear

• Added a V60 and a Phin filter into the rotation.

• Some new cups/glassware.

The Vibe Check

• Installed LED lights to set the mood.

• Added some personal photos and magnets.

• And yes, that is Ash Ketchum guarding the grinder. Gotta brew 'em all!

Lately, I've been stuck on this one thought while looking at the tech news: **Science fiction isn't really a genre anymore. It’s just ""early access.""**

I was working on some content recently regarding AI, the Metaverse, and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and I realized I can’t even say ""in the future"" anymore. It’s literally happening right now. The scenarios that used to creep us out in *Black Mirror* are now popping up as notifications on our phones while we drink our morning coffee.

But here is what I’m actually struggling with, and I want to ask you guys: **Have our brains actually adapted to this speed?**

Most people still see this tech as just ""new toys to consume."" But I feel like we’re way past entertainment. If you don't stake your claim in this digital economy, you're going to end up like the people who watched the Industrial Revolution from the sidelines. I constantly ask myself: *""Am I actually part of this shift, or am I just watching it happen?""*

What do you think is the single most critical skill for this transition? It feels like just knowing how to code or investing is not enough anymore.

He daily bites me leaving marks. Am I overreacting thinking he is the actual violent one projecting on me? Or AITA for playing rough with him?","My boyfriend bites me alot, and says he just cannot contain himself. He often hurts me when he does this, including leaving marks. He also takes his hands and cups it around my neck, even though I have asked him to be careful as the nerves and blood vessels in that area are fragile.

Yesterday, we were fooling around and laughing joking around my coffee making skills, in the kitchen and I playfully slapped his face and lifted my knee up to his groin . Next thing I know at 4:30 am when he wakes up for work, he wakes me up asking  me if I was a violent person. I was half asleep and did not answer and was confused so his response was I am not denying it so I must be violent. I laughed it off still thinking this was some joke, but I saw him being pensive for over 5 min sitting in the dark thinking.

He messages me a few hours later from work saying he is ""worried"" about me as I am violent.

This is shocking to me that he would still ask me this as I have a daily struggle with him biting me, leaving marks, pushing is finger into my butt even when its sore ( and after I had a colonoscopy) for anal stenosis.

He sees no issues with this  and even promised in 2026 he will not bite me anymore as I have complained the marks were looking bad on my body and had to cover my body with specific clothing.

It does nothing. And the Driver Support Fund fee? It funds lobbying against drivers rights.,"I'm writing this from a coffee shop on a burner laptop using their wifi. Yes, I signed a hell of an NDA, but I don't care anymore. I put in my two weeks notice on Monday. This has been eating at me for nine months, watching the features I built roll out, and I feel sick to my stomach.  
Everyone thinks there's some complex algorithm screwing them over, but the truth is pettier and more malicious than any conspiracy theory. As a backend dev, I'm in the weekly meetings where the business guys scheme how to squeeze another half a percent of profit out of our resource units (that's genuinely the term they use for drivers in internal documents). They talk about drivers like they're chess pieces, not human beings trying to feed their families.  
Let's start with Priority Delivery. It's a total scam. The internal pitch was improved customer perception of value. When you pay that extra fee, all it does is flip a single bit in the order data. The dispatch system doesn't even look at it. Your order doesn't get there any faster.  
About a year ago, we ran an experiment. We didn't make priority orders faster. Instead, we intentionally delayed standard orders by 6 to 12 minutes to create the illusion that priority works. The executives were ecstatic. It generated insane revenue just by making the standard experience worse for everyone else.  
But the feature that broke me, the reason I'm leaving, is something we call the Urgency Index. It's a secret score we calculate for every driver, gauging how desperate they are for money based on their acceptance patterns.  
If a driver logs on around 11 PM and immediately snags whatever crappy $4 order comes their way, the system flags them as High Urgency. Once they're flagged, we throttle their access to higher-paying orders. Our internal logic is literally: Why give this person a $16 delivery when they'll accept a $7 one? The good orders are used as bait for new or part-time drivers, while the people who rely on this for a living are squeezed for every last drop.  
And don't get me started on tips. We call it Tip Skimming 2.0 internally. We got in trouble for openly stealing tips before, so now we just use it to subsidize our own costs. Our system predicts whether you're a generous tipper. If it thinks you're likely to leave a $12 tip, it might offer the driver a base fare of just $3. But if it predicts you won't tip at all, it offers the driver $9 just to get the order delivered. Your tip isn't going to the driver as an extra bonus. It's simply replacing the money we were supposed to pay them. You're literally paying their wages for us.  
Then there are the benefit fees. You know that $1.99 Local Driver Support Fund or Mandatory Service Fee that popped up after those new labor laws? They word it carefully to make you think you're doing something good for the driver. That money goes directly into a company account dedicated to lobbying against those very labor laws. There's an internal budget called Government Relations, and these fees are its primary source of funding. You're paying for the lawyers who are actively working to deny drivers rights and benefits.

1q2u2yy,https://i.redd.it/l9sbmssbu4bg1.jpeg,Feeder,"

The stench had gotten worse every day since Sarah left; she was the heart of this house, and now without her, it rotted around me. Ninety-three days have passed since she left, over three months of excess and misery, watching the walls of filth grow around me—my only sense of day-to-day progression. I felt as though she left me with a hole in my stomach, one I relentlessly tried to fill, but her impression was too intricate; the crude substitutions of food and drink only seemed to stretch and warp her outline. 

Things hadn’t always been this way; I suppose I was always a bit of a slob, but it used to be manageable. I worked at a dump, compacting mountains of trash, so my tolerance to filth had always been a bit more endurant than most. But after the car accident, after Molly and my back injury, I grew less and less capable of cleaning up after myself. I was no longer able to work either; forced to retire and draw disability, I spent all my days stewing on my grave mistake, replaying my sweet Molly’s scream from the backseat over and over in my head. Things had just gotten worse, to the point where Susan could no longer manage to deal with the trail of mess I left behind with my every step. I didn’t blame her for leaving; I just had no idea how to continue without her. I had nothing now. 

Nothing can ever prepare you for losing a child; when Molly died it felt as though the world should end around me, like a fundamental law of reality and decency has been irreprovably violated to an extent that the world should stop moving. But it just keeps going.  

Cluttering mounds of trash tangled with clothes hid the floors and surfaces, a crude collage from hundreds of binges, each piece a memory flashing in my mind as my eyes roved around the room. 

I hadn’t slept the night before, just catatonically stared at the mold growing down from my ceiling. It had started as a splotch on the leaky ceiling that Sarah had routinely sprayed with bleach to cull its growth. I’d allowed it to grow; I’d even taken to talking to it, reminiscing about times I spent with my family, back when the world made sense.
My bladder ached as I lay in bed; typically I would just use one of the bottles covering my nightstand, but they’d all been filled to the brim. My bedsheet felt like the scabbed skin of a junkie, scratching me with its brittle, chewed nails as I rolled towards the edge and grabbed my cane. 

Something damp and furry squelched under my foot as I pushed through the trash and landed on the carpet, digging a path with my feet. The matted carpet felt like clay under my feet, like I was walking through a muddy lake of trash as I tried to hurriedly dig a path to the bathroom. I grabbed the door and pulled, but it was barricaded;  my bladder felt like it would give with each consecutive tug of the door. I edged the door along until it was finally wide enough to slide my bulk through. Now in a full panic for relief, I trampled over the pile, feeling it rough and scratchy against my feet. After I’d ascended to the peak of the pile, still feet away from the toilet, I dropped my sweatpants around my knees. 

I relieved myself, then hesitantly grabbed my scale from the counter. I knew the results weren’t going to be good, but my morbid curiosity required me to attach a number to attach numerical value to my sense of self-deprecation. The numbers spun so fast that it looked like it may fly off the scale, passing the maximum of three hundred pounds and landing at the fifty mark. 
“My god. How can I have gained forty pounds in the last three months?”

I let out a sigh but quickly went quiet as I heard something coming from my hallway. A soft, familiar, harmonious whisper, a tune I recognized distinctly as it scored the memories that looped in my head on repeat. It was “I Can’t Help Falling in Love with You,” our song and her ringtone.

I turned around and hurried back to my room, tripping lightly over the mound behind me in my desperation to catch her call. Entering the hallway, my foot clipped against the tunnel of trash, sending it avalanching over the path in front of me. I began to trample over the pile, feeling it crunch under my feet as I hurried along. Stepping through the doorway, I saw her name surrounded by hearts on my phone, but my balance started to waver, it felt as though the pile started to shake below me and I fell face forward. My head smashed hard into the metal bed frame, and my forehead split open as I groggily landed in the pile of trash. I felt dizzy and confused as I raised my head. I was lost and entranced by the sound of her song as I tried to recall what I was doing. Then the music stopped, and it came back to me.

“I have to call her back.” I felt blood streaming down my face and dripping off my chin as I stood to my feet.

My balance was still wobbly as I made my way to the phone. Blood slickened my phone, my thumbs leaving a crime scene around the screen as I frustratedly tried to call her back. I turned it on speaker and listened as each dial tone marked the descent towards disappointment; I just needed to hear her voice, I thought. My foot nervously tapped at the damp spot, matching the rapid beat of my heart against my ribs. The sixth tone sounded with no answer and left me with a pathetic frown on my face as the robotic voice sent me to her voicemail.

“Hi, this is Sarah. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message at the beep.”
I looked at my phone, wiping the dragged lines of running blood on my shirt before seeing she’d left a voicemail.

""Hey Matt, this is Sarah. I’m just calling to let you know I’m going to be coming by to grab the last of my stuff next Friday. I hope you’re taking care of yourself; we’ll get coffee then and talk about all this. … I still love you, Matt.”
The relief her voice used to bring was gone; instead, it just stung at the circumference of the hole in my stomach. That last line echoed through the apathetic void in my mind: “I still love you.” What did she mean by that? Was she just being nice? Or is there hope for us still? I replayed it six times, each time with the naive hope that the next listen would bring some clarity to the statement, that I’d pick up on some subtle nuance that clarified the debacle. But each time just increased my stress and twisted the ambiguity of the message into a self-inflicted weapon of conspiratorial thoughts. 

Anxious thoughts recklessly looped around my mind, like a train off its rails moving in concentric circles with exponential momentum. I fell back to my typical last line of defense for these episodes. I went to the kitchen.

The floor felt sticky on my feet, like the grime was trying to trap me there, saying, ""Stay and indulge further."" I swung the fridge door open, letting loose the trapped stench of rot. A plate of burgers that Sarah had left to thaw before she left abruptly. I held my breath as I reached the rack above it to grab a twelve-pack of Bud Light; the door clanked slightly against the glass bottles as I hurriedly closed it behind them. I opened the pantry, reaching behind the coffee to grab the pack of snowballs. I felt something furry graze along my fingers before it squeaked away.

Anticipation and shame swirled in my belly, fighting for dominance as I followed the trail back to the bed. I fell into bed, and my body reflexively opened the first snowball on muscle memory, taking no time to taste as I forced the dry sphere past my lips. Crumbs rained onto my belly as I chewed with my mouth forced open. I grabbed another, unwrapping it ravenously with my mouth still half full and biting half of it off to feel my mouth packed with cake and marshmallow again. I felt myself choking on the dry pastry, heavy and slow in my throat, the narrow streams of air barely worming their way through the crumble, and I started to hack slightly. My throat squeezed against the sweet obstruction; I opened one of the beers and began to pour it over the dense packing, feeling the cake soften to a carbonated chocolate mud that dripped down my throat. I continued cramming, rinsing down the fourth and then the fifth before my stomach began to protest. I let the cake fall from my mouth to my sheets as I quickly grabbed an aluminum bottle from the bedside table, screwed off the top, and wrapped my lips around it. The smell of ammonia hit me hard as the bile exited my mouth and splashed back onto my lips. I realized with disgust what I had done. I started gagging as I thrust the bottle away from my face, feeling it splash onto my wrist. I screwed the lid back onto it before throwing it next to my bed, watching as the bottle sank to the bottom as if dragged. The bottle filled the room with the stench of piss and vomit, so I decided to go to the living room. 

I was overwhelmed with vertigo as I stood up; my footing faltered. As my mind swirled, I nearly slipped on the same spot from before. It felt significantly deeper and wetter; sticky red slime rose with my foot, and I disgustedly dragged it on the clay-covered carpet to wipe it off.

The living room was buried in two feet of trash; on a quick scan around, you’d be hard-pressed to identify a single object in the tangled mounds, outside of the yellow-stained couch and the box TV surrounded by bottles that hid the bottom half of the picture. I plopped down on my La-Z-Boy, pulling the lever and watching as detritus was thrown across the room; the metal screeched under my weight as my ass form-fitted into the seat. 
I turned on the TV, and the DVD inserted into it started playing, a slideshow of pictures and videos from when we were young. A picture of us at the bar popped onto the screen, me holding her in one arm and a beer in the other. I was so young and strong then. Sarah looked so happy, laughing wildly. I don’t remember the last time I saw her like that… My nose started to run as tears began to well in my eyes. I felt that pit in my stomach rising, feeling at risk of swallowing me whole; it demanded I stuff it down. I fixed my gaze on the snack as I forced it into my mouth when our song came on again. I looked up to see us dancing; we twirled around the room, and my mind flashed to the night. We danced for hours, until everyone else had left the cathedral. I haven’t been able to dance since the accident; now I can barely walk on my own.

We’d continued to grow distant since that day. She was kind and tried to help me deal with the guilt, but I always felt like she blamed me on some level. I know I do.

“God…things have gotten so bad.” As I said this, a glob of chewed chocolate fell from my full mouth and onto my belly, rolling off into the trash.

A photo of our last Christmas appeared on screen, and I was reminded of when this room was cluttered with presents and shining decorations rather than filth. I began to sob wildly at this sight. Molly tore open the last of her presents and saw a big plush rat.

“I love it so much!” She said, squeezing her arms around it.

“I’ll name him Mr. Cheesy!”

“Goddammit.” I pressed my hands against my stinging eyes.  “I have to get this all clean. I need Sarah back. God, I can’t live like this.”

I continued to eat as I sobbed uncontrollably until I fell asleep with my mouth still full.
I woke to a sound coming from my bedroom; it was difficult to decipher with my mind still fuzzy, but it sounded like a pained groan. At first I thought it must be an animal that had gotten trapped. I grabbed my beer and my cane and started towards the door.

But as I got closer, I realized this wasn’t an animal. Impossibly, I thought it sounded like Sarah. “Fuck,” I thought. Did she come through early to get her stuff? She sounds hurt? I hoped she hadn’t slipped in the piles of trash and injured herself; I’d never be able to stomach the shame if my mess got her hurt.
I began to rush towards the door as fast as I was able.

“Sarah? Are you okay?” My throat tensed and nostrils revolted at the overwhelming stench of filth that hit me as I opened the door.
I covered my nose, adrenaline stifling a gag as my panicked eyes darted around the room, but I didn’t see her.

Looking to the corner of the room, I saw the large heap of trash next to the bed twitching incrementally; the pieces of trash seemed to flare out, giving a brief glimpse of a red skeletal base that connected the individual pieces. 

“Matt.” Sarah’s voice would call from the pile, interspersed between shrill, painful cries in her voice.

My sense of fight or flight sent me racing; I just wanted to stop the torturous screams, so I began to dismantle the pile. I grabbed a bag of chips at its base and began to pull, but it felt stuck on. I felt sticky skin pulling like wet adhesive; it made a sloppy sloshing noise, and I was hit with a stench of spit, stale soda, and piss. Her scream heightened in pitch, causing my eardrums to ring. Blood rushed from under the bag as red tendrils pulled against my grip.
“Matt, you’re hurting me, Matt.”

My grip released, and the bag snapped back into place with a wet clapping noise that sent sticky red liquid spritzing around my face. It tasted like Sarah’s mouth if she’d eaten the contents of a dumpster. I felt sickened and longing at the reminder, but it also tasted nostalgic and heavenly.

“Please, Matt, I’m so hungry. Please, bottle. Give bottle.” 

“What the fuck are you?”

“It’s me, Matt.”

“No, this doesn’t make any sense. What do you want from me?”

“Matt, please, I’m so hungry; Matt, help me, or I’ll die.” The words felt good to hear in a perverse way; it had been so long since I’d felt needed, I’d gotten so used to being the one needing help. I stood frozen, eyeing the bottle of beer in my hand.

“You just want the bottle?”

“Yes, please.”

I drank the rest of the stale beer and threw it into the pile; I watched as the trash avalanched over it. I heard a cracking of glass and watched as the shimmering fragments began to spread around the exterior of its mass, the light catching off it making it shine with a brilliant radiance.

“I love you, Matt.”

“Why do you sound like her?”

“It’s me, Sarah.”

Pain shot up my knees as I fell in front of the pile in gawking reverence. I saw small red spots speckled around it; ripples moved in waves through the crimson puddles. I touched one of them with my thumb and felt warm blood spread under my finger.

It winced slightly. “Soft, please.”

I kept my eyes on the pile as I backed out of the room, closing the door behind me. I heard the pie through the door humming the tune of Sarah and my song.

“I’m losing my mind,” I said, rubbing my thumbs on my temples.

I went back to my chair, my feet unconsciously syncing me to the harmony of our song as my body swayed slightly. I plopped down, grabbing a snowball and tearing it from the pack. I stared at it in my hand, mouth open in preparation. I felt disgusted at the sight of it; my stomach turned at the thought of scarfing it down. I threw it into the pile. I suddenly felt a wave of relaxed exhaustion hit me as my adrenaline crashed.

“I have got to get out of here, man; I need to get away from this mess.”

I went to the one clean room in the house, my daughter's room, left completely untouched since she passed.

Walking in felt like I was entering a different world, from a house buried in trash to a bastion of childhood whimsy, with pink walls sporting posters of fantastical creatures and landscapes.

Her bed was made tightly, and rather than disturb it, I lay on the floor, snuggled tightly with Mr. Cheesy as the song still faintly echoed to me. I buried my face into it, feeling my tears dampen its fur against my face.
I cried until I fell asleep.

I was woken by Sarah’s groans reverberating into the room; my head rushed up, and for a fleeting moment I expected to see her next to me before the memories of the last few months flooded back to my mind, followed shortly by the insanity of last night. I looked up at the clock; it was 3:00 AM. I scrambled to my feet, noticing I had left my cane in the living room, before I dragged myself with only a slight limp back to my room.

“Matt, please, I’m so hungry.” I looked at the pile, which was noticeably smaller; the specks of blood dotting its surface had shrunken into brown shriveled scabs.

“I just fed you,” I said, still bleary-eyed and disoriented, my head pounded and swirled in confusion. Her whines felt like spikes penetrating through my clouded brain, insanely standing as the only point of cohesion and understanding in my confused state.

“More, please. More, or I’ll die, Matt, and you’ll lose me.”

I tried to focus my thoughts. Was this a good idea? I’m not sure what this thing is, but I was unsure of most things at the moment, my head aching and disoriented, unable to grasp my reality.

Sarah’s voice let out a bloodcurdling cry that cleared any thoughts of moral decisions and sent me into a primal scramble to save the one I loved.

“Sarah? Are you okay?” I said it but got no response. I kicked myself slightly for calling this thing Sarah, but my panic did not subside with the realization. I shook the pile, feeling the bottles lazily drag as if through viscous liquid; it sounded wet, and the smell of bile emanated from the opening it formed. I watched as a bottle consolidated itself into a ball before being sucked into the center of the pile, causing it to shrink down a couple of inches at its center.

“I’m dying, Matt.”  Its voice cried weakly.
I grabbed as much garbage as I could fit in the breadth of my arms, feeling greasy stains and backwash soak through my white t-shirt as I hauled load after load towards the pile. I dumped the trash onto it and watched as it seemed to open out, widening the holes and swallowing the loose detritus in its many openings. Smooth, translucent, red mouths lined with black furry veins extended from the openings, biting at the rain of garbage and scarfing it down, blood spurting as it smacked its lips. The pile continued to swell as it ingested more of its food; a small poof of smoke billowed from each of its holes. I watched a two-liter stick from its peak still only halfway down; greasy burger wrappers lubricated its descent, but it seemed to get stuck before the plastic on the bottle began to warp as if chemically heated.

The pile doubled in size; I watched as the blood splotches grew to massive patches of blood sodden, gooey musculature around the pile. It stretched around the bottles and grew over the ridges of crumpled paper and plastic. It grew around the circumference of the puddles with fibrous tendrils that walked down its mass, intertwining to form a wall of soft, sinewy tissue that looked like a massive throbbing tumor.

“I love you so much, Matt. Thank you.”

“You’re not really her.”

“But I can be Matt; I just need more.”

I wasn’t going to be getting any more sleep, so I decided to start cleaning. After all, how bad could this thing be if it was encouraging me to clean my house? It needed to be clean when the real Sarah got here anyways.

I went to the kitchen and grabbed the dusty box of trash bags and began before heading back to my room. I still limped slightly, but it was better than it had been since the accident. She sang our song as I cleaned, and I was reminded of how Sarah would sing and hum when she cleaned.

I filled bag after bag as I awkwardly danced and swayed around the room to her song.
I filled twelve bags of what was left on the floor in the room. I’d also vacuumed the carpet, filling the empty tank of the vacuum three times over before the job was done. The mold on the wall had spread rapidly; it was thick in the carpet around the pile and spread around the room like a complex vascular system faintly visible on the dark-stained carpet.

“I got a lot for you to eat now; you shouldn’t be hungry for a while.” I said, my voice shaken slightly with uncertainty.

“Oh Matt, you’re so good to me, I would never leave you.” I found myself blushing slightly at her words.

The bags were heavy and sagged with liquid at their bottom, feeling as though they may burst through as the plastic strained against the weight. I dragged the bags one by one towards her; I turned around with it the size of a beachball, and when I came back with the next bag, it was the size of a washing machine, with its mouths the size of my head and growing. This continued until I dumped the final bag of trash onto it and saw it grow to the size of a twin-sized bed and up to the chest of my 5’10” frame. Thick red liquid secreted from under its mass in synchronized bursts with what sounded like water drumming against metal. I could feel the sticky liquid pooling between my toes, sticking my feet to the ground, and when I lifted them, thick strings of the stuff came up with my foot feeling like strings of wet cement. The furry black veins sprawled across the irregular membrane with the complexity and intricacy of a spider web. Pieces of trash jutted out around the dark red stomach, stretching its skin taut and giving it a spiny appearance; it looked as if the skin might tear as it throbbed outward. I heard metal and plastic popping as the jutting imprints of trash compressed flat.

Though I didn’t feel tired while working, after I’d finished I was hit by a wave of exhaustion. I crawled next to her in my bed and went to sleep despite it only being 5pm.

The next day I cleaned the bathroom; the mold had already spread tentacular, hardly visible on the stained black linoleum. I looked into my mirror after I’d cleaned the floor, seeing one of my pupils double the size of the other with my eyes a bright red. I was able to nearly finish the hallway the same day before I fell from exhaustion at her base. 

That night I lay down next to the pile, and we watched old videos. I watched one of Sarah and me playing with Molly at the park; I pushed her high into the air on the swing, and she screamed with joy and mock fear as she soared into the air.

“Haha thank you, Daddy” She screamed.
“I miss Molly so much.” I said with a tear forming in my eye.

A long, slimy tendril wiped my eye.

“I know, Matt, so do I.”

I hugged the slimy mass of flesh. Crying my eyes out and feeling the blend of blood and salty tears mix in my eyes.

“Do me a favor, please.”

“What is it, Matt?”

“Stay out of her room; I just want that to remain pure.”

“I promise, Matt, I won’t touch it at all.”
I wiped the red liquid off of my body before crawling into bed.

The living room took three days to finish, and as I finished wiping down the surfaces, I wrung the gray liquid from the filthy paper towels over her and watched as small mouths gaped around her body, slurping down the running gray water. I even dumped the nearly full pack of snowballs into one of the bags. I hadn’t worked like this in years, but it didn’t feel like work. I didn’t take breaks; I didn’t feel I needed them. I felt more rested now cleaning nineteen-plus hours a day than I had sleeping more than half of it away. Now that I had Sarah's angelic voice to lull me to sleep, my days had gone from lethargic fatigue to a focused drive propelled by an almost manic energy. She sang our song on repeat as I jovially floated around the house, my motion in sync with her harmony as I cleaned. The fungal map moved under my feet, tickling me slightly.

She now nearly filled the entire room, touching all four corners and sloping up at her center to nearly touch the light fixture. I tore open the bag as I stood in the doorway and began feeding the damp towels into her front-facing mouth.

“Why don’t you look like her?” I said as I grabbed one of the used towels from the bag and fed it into the bulbous lips of the mouth in front of me.

“I’m trying to, but it’s so hard with just plastic and paper; I need flesh matt, flesh to make flesh.” Her words were uninterrupted as her mouth closed around my fingers and sucked the towel away from my grip.

I thought about the meat in the fridge; I’d hardly opened the fridge in the last several days, so it had slipped my mind. I fed her one more of the towels before heading to the kitchen.

I opened the door to the fridge, and though the meat had progressed in its rot, the smell no longer offended me but was a recognizable change from the prevailing scent of filth that I’d gotten used to. I grabbed the plate and headed back to her, sliding the meat down into her mouth. I then watched as its tongue extended and licked the molded blood from the plate. The flesh above her mouth began to bubble and rise into a nub of pink translucent flesh that bloomed out of the stomach from in front of where I stood at the doorway. Flakes of scaly pale skin scattered patchily around the nub, which was the size of a fist and twitched lazily.

“This is a good start, Matt, but I’m going to need more.”

“Ok.” I pulled out my phone and made an order.

“Lie with me, Matt; you’ve given me so much. Hold me.”

I lay down in the thick puddle of red at her feet, my legs forced out of the doorway, her soft flesh forming around my head. I could feel the sticky liquid worming into my ear canal as I made my head comfortable and went to sleep.

The next morning I sat up from the puddle of crimson, feeling it peel off my skin in stringy vines that snapped as I sat up. My left ear coughed out thick red molasses as I smacked the right side of my head. 

“Good morning, my love.” Her voice had been getting more like Sarah's every day and now was indistinguishable.

“Good morning,” I said, rising to my feet.

I went to the bathroom and grabbed a towel off the sink, wiping the liquid off me. While I was in the bathroom, I thought to step on the scale; it read 270, which I was ecstatic to see, and I realized how ridiculous I was to think she could be bad for me. So far she’d only helped me to clean my house and lose weight. I lifted my shirt and saw a pile of loose skin bundled around my midsection and sagging down to my waist. 

I returned to the room, wrung the towel into the pile, and watched pink tube-like appendages stick from the mouths and bend to suck the liquid dripping down it. 

“The meat is on its way.”

“Yay, thank you, Matt.”

With the house now clean, I had nothing better to do than to wait at the door for the delivery, preparing an explanation for if the driver had a remark about the strange order. I’d used the last of my monthly check to make the purchase and was eager to see the results. I thought about how wonderful it would be, even if it wasn’t really Sarah, if it sounded like her and looked like her and made me feel the way she did. Was there a difference?

The thought was interrupted by a banging at the door.

I cracked the door open to see a man standing with bags clustered in his hands. He eyed me oddly as I reached past the cracked door to grab the bags wordlessly.

I carried the bags into the room and set them in front of the pile. 12 frozen chickens.

“Thank you so much, Matt, but can you do me a favor?”

""What is it?""

“Don’t watch.”

My large, sweaty hands slipped under the tight plastic, feeling soft, wet skin over the hard frozen center. After stripping them all bare, I began to insert them from head to toe into the orifice. It was too tight to enter at first, but as I rubbed it around the hole, I watched it gape wider and begin to drip sticky brown liquid that made the hole more malleable. I listened to the sweet familiar sounds of Sarah’s moans as I pushed the raw meat with all my force, feeling it deepen inch by inch. The legs felt stuck, and I had to reach into the hole and clasp one side of its interior wall, widening it out to force the rest in. I felt the warm, fleshy walls of her entrails around my fingers as my hand pressed the rest of the poultry inside of her. 

I heard her begin to cry and pulled my hand out, noticing it was a bright red and stinging under the brown liquid coating it, as if from a slightly caustic solution.

“Are you okay? Do you want me to stop?”

“No, keep going!”

I listened to the slopping sounds of meat being digested as I forced my focus to inserting each of the chickens, feeling the orifice widen and moisten with each consecutive intrusion. The last few of the birds entered in with ease and began to dissolve as soon as they touched the brown liquid; I only had to start them into her before the mouth slurped the rest of it into her mouth. As I pushed the remainder of the last chicken into her, an intense burning sensation made me tear my hand away as it made contact with the sludgey brown lubricant.

“Ok, you can look now.”

Her skin was white and pink; small bumps lined the blank human torso and face, with bones jutting occasionally through the skin. Slivers of fat draped down from her ears, nose, and lips and down to cover her nipples. But despite the grotesque exterior, it had formed in the shape of Sarah near perfectly. There was a small pale bump that sprouted under her form.

I slid past the mass of flesh to get into the closet. Sat in the back, wrapped in plastic, was her wedding dress. I slid past her again, unwrapped the dress, and signaled for her to raise her arms. I slid the dress onto her; it bunched at her hips to form a flowing white reef where her torso started.

I approached her closely, pulling a small sharp shard of bone that stuck out from her cheek. My eyes met hers, a milky white, and our bodies touched, feeling my shirt dampen with cold liquid as I caressed my hand down her cheek, feeling its freeze thaw under my touch. I kissed her, tasting cool blood and hard fat in my mouth, feeling the fat coat my tongue as it melted from the heat of my mouth. 

“I love you, Sarah.” I said, pulling away and watching the red fluid drip from her mouth and onto the dress.

“I love you too, Matt.”

I wiped the fluid off of my face, offering her my hand, to which a vascular tongue stuck from one of its mouths and licked it clean.
“Why don’t you burn me like you do the trash?”
 
“Because I choose not to.”

The harmony as she hummed put me in a trance; our bodies came together, and we began to dance. I don’t know how long we danced for. My feet went numb but still effortlessly found the rhythm of her song. Night came and darkened the room, and our silhouettes still swayed against the ambiguity of shadow. Light would pour in, showcasing our love to the rising sun, only to be replaced once again by the night, rendering us secret lovers under the cloak of anonymity. I felt the lump on her stomach slowly growing as we danced. Time lost any meaning within the harmonious display of love; each sway felt like it could last forever. It was a display of the cruelty of time that a moment of such remarkable beauty could end, but such cynicism was a false presumption, as the next motion complemented the story being told. Day and night were rendered an arbitrary setting for something much more important, one whose passage I hardly noticed before long.

As I moved to dip her down, I felt my finger pierce through soft flesh, pulling it away to reveal a black rot on my fingers. 

I stepped back, seeing the growth was now the size of a bowling ball.

“Baby, are you okay? You’re rotting.”
“It’s just… The meat you brought me was already dead; it’ll rot quickly. If you want it to last, I need something living.”

“I can’t feed you something living; that’s wrong and cruel.”

The smell of rot wafted up to me as she pressed her finger to my lips, shushing me. A moment of silence passed before I heard a squeaking in the walls.

“Well, the rats I suppose I need to get rid of them anyways; what’s the harm?”

I went to the living room and grabbed the box of snowballs that I’d left untouched on the coffee table for several days. I opened one, carried it to the kitchen, and left it on the floor as I waited.

About thirty minutes passed before one of the vermin began to sniff at it. I approached slowly, careful not to alert it to my presence. As it began to bite into the treat, I grabbed it from behind. It scratched and clawed at my hand, but despite the pain, I kept a single-minded ambition to carry it to her. As I walked through the bedroom door, it bit down hard on my hand, piercing through it and sending blood streaming down my palm and into its furry coat. I quickly pressed my hand through Sarah's stomach. The creature's cries were frantic in the stomach but died off quickly.

I looked up from nursing my wounded hand to see her clouded pearly eyes rolled over and now showing beady red pupils, as a tuft of scraggly hair sprouted from her scalp.
“I’m going to go get you more.” I said with an exasperated breath.

As I walked through the hallway, I looked at Molly's door, seeing that the mold had started to ease its way underneath it.

I was filled with righteous indignation as I slung her door open and saw that the serpentine path of mold had now lined most of the carpeting. It had even crawled over the plush rat. 

“No, no, no.” 

I marched back into the room.

“Who the hell do you think you are?”

“You stay the hell out of my daughter’s room; you’ve got no goddamn right. I told you never to go in there.”

“It wasn’t me, Matt; please listen.”

I was filled with fury. I grabbed the bulging lump, and I began to rip it from the pile. I pulled, watching the soft skin tear. I hadn’t put strength like this onto something in a very long time. She screamed and cried insanely, pleading with me to stop and listen. 
I felt a sense of triumph at the display of my newfound strength as the skin ripped and plummeted to my back. But my sense of pride was shortcut by a higher pitched scream piercing through Sarahs, one that’s played through my mind everyday since the accident. 
The ball of flesh flattened out and laid flat over my face, I carefully pulled it off my face laying it on the ground as I rose to my knees.

“Daddy? Why did you hurt me, Daddy?”
Molly's face was carved into the underdeveloped bloody mess.

“No.”

“It hurts.” Her voice was trailing off into a whisper.

“Please, God, no.”

“I’ve killed her; I’ve killed her again. God, why? Why could this happen to me?”

“I can save her, Matt; give her to me.”

I pressed the flap over the leaking hole in her stomach and watched as the skin seemed grafted itself on roughly.

“I can heal her, Matt, but I’m going to need something big; I need a person.”

“I can’t do that.”

“It’s the only way, Matt!”

“Ok, just let me think; I just need to think this through.” My head still felt dizzy and clouded; I didn’t know how long I’d been up or when the last time I’d eaten or drunk anything was. 

“There’s no time to think, Matt.” 

“Someone’s here.” 

A knock came from my door.

“Wash yourself off quickly, Matt; you need to lure them in.”

I sprinted towards the bathroom, turning on the shower and rinsing the dried blood from my skin and matted hair, sending it pooling in the tub below me. 

“Just a minute,” I shouted.

I grabbed my last pair of clean clothes from the dryer that had been sitting there for the last several months. I thought it could be a nosy neighbor asking about the smell or the landlord. But I had no choice; if they were insistent on coming in, they would need to be disposed of.

I looked out the peephole to see who the unfortunate victim would be. It was Sarah. 
“Shit,” I whispered. Had it been two weeks already? Everything had been moving so quickly.

I stood there in awe as she knocked again.
I saw her eyes go wide before narrowing inquisitively.

“Hey Matt, how are you? Wow, you’ve lost a lot of weight.” 

“Uh, yeah, I’ve been dieting, I suppose. I’m good though, yeah, I’ve been really good. How have you been?” I said, trying my best to appear casual as my heart pounded in my chest. 

“I’m fine; you’ll have to excuse me. I've been sick with covid, but I’m mostly over it now, besides still not being able to taste or smell anything. Can I come in?” she said, blowing her red nose into a tissue.

“Uh, yeah, just come to the kitchen; I’ll make a pot of coffee.” I let her in, hoping she wouldn’t see the black fungal map under her feet.
I led us through the hallway.

“Wow, it’s spotless in here; it looks so good, Matt. I’m proud of you.”

“Of course, Sarah; I just want us to work.”

“I know, Matt, I do too.”

I closed my eyes as I listened to the sound of her humming behind me while I poured the water into the pot, but my soothed state diminished as I realized there was another humming matching hers from farther away.
I abruptly turned around and took my seat, hoping to distract her before she noticed the mimicry.

“I’ve been really worried about you, Matt.” The words echoed from the room, and I saw Sarah turn her head towards the noise in confusion.

""I’m doing great; there's no need to worry. I’ve just missed you a lot.” I said quickly, trying to break the silence.

“I’ve missed you too.” She squinted her eyes.

“Is there an echo in here?”

“Ah yeah, I guess now that it’s clean, you know?”

“Right.”

“Sarah, I need you in my life. I can’t stand to be without you; these last few months have been miserable.”

“You were miserable with me too, Matt. I’m not the problem in your life. I appreciate the efforts you’ve made, but I need more than for you to clean the house once.”

“It’s not a one-time thing, I promise. I’ll keep it clean; just please, I’m nothing without you.”

“This is what I mean; I can’t be solely responsible for your well-being. I’ve been through this cycle with you before; I’ve seen you make changes, and they just go away over time. I just can’t do that anymore, Matt. I’ve made my decision,"" she said before once again sneezing into her napkin.

My expression went cold. “That’s fine. Please, if you don’t mind, can you grab the rest of your stuff from the room? I can’t bear to see it anymore.”

“I understand.” She said, standing up from the table. 

I watched as she swung the door open in front of her. Watched as she was immediately hit by trash avalanching down to her feet and how the trash seemed to caramelize atop her feet. She tried to tug them, but she screamed in agony as they refused to move. The red flesh began to form back around the trash that was burying Sarah's lower half. Sarah made eye contact with her deformed mimic. My heart sank as she turned back to look at me; with tears in my eyes, I placed my hand on her back and forced her closer to the other Sarah.
She stopped resisting as Molly's face appeared in front of her.

""I love you"" Molly's voice said.

She closed her eyes and extended her arms, trembling as she allowed the pile to embrace her; her skin began to soften and melt away, and I watched the pink salmonella hands dig under the melting skin like clay before painting it over her rotting flesh. Her meat and bones sagged in place as her stomach formed around her, consuming her body into the all-consuming membranous stomach. 
It was a near-perfect imitation of her; only the smell was off. The smell was family, all the filth I’d acquired with love. She floated across the pile, resting on her back where the bed was.

“Lay with me.”  She said her nose began to drip off, and she reshaped it quickly, leaving it asymmetrical and twisted.

I crawled over the soft tissue of her stomach; the pain I felt meant nothing as my palms melted me into place with each stride in my crawl or when I ripped my sticky, melting hand to get closer to her. Tears dripped from my face and sent the gore from my hand running down her belly.

I crawled on top of her, feeling her skin now soft and warm, smelling the scent of her perfume faintly over the overwhelming stench of rot and trash. I felt myself dissolving in her mouth as I sank down, my silhouette forming into the gelatinous flesh perfectly. It was the most delightful sensation I’d ever known, to be fully embraced and accepted as what you are. I heard a whisper before my body sank fully into the stomach.

“Thank you, Daddy.”

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Nerve pain can ruin your mood faster than stepping on LEGO. It's sneaky, persistent, and weirdly personal — like your body’s staging a tiny protest.

For people with **burning feet at night**, tingling fingers, or legs that go numb by lunchtime, relief feels like wishful thinking. It's exhausting to live this way.

So, does [Nerve Revive 360](https://theworldhealth.org/nerve-revive-360-official) offer more than just another shelf-filler? Is it worth the click and the coin? Here's the full scoop, from burnt-out nerves to hopeful toes.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Nerve Revive 360  
**Category:** Health Supplements → Nerve Support  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.6/5

This supplement targets chronic nerve pain with a formula that aims to **support nerve healing** over time. It’s packed with plant-based and vitamin ingredients.

Made in FDA-registered U.S. facilities, it helps relieve **nerve pain** while addressing issues like **tingling, numbness**, and sensitivity in the hands and feet.

# 🔍 What Makes Nerve Revive 360 Different?

Most products mask symptoms. This one uses a **dual-action formula** — it helps calm pain and works with your body to **repair nerve damage naturally**.

It contains **Alpha Lipoic Acid** and **Benfotiamine**, a combo often praised for helping **regenerate nerves quickly and naturally** without the side effects of meds.

There's also **Passion Flower**, **Corydalis**, and **California Poppy Seed**, all known to reduce discomfort and encourage sleep without knocking you out.

You’ll also find **B vitamins** and **Magnesium**, key **vitamins that relieve nerve pain** and **help restore nerve function** across the board.

# 👤 Alison’s Experience

A few weeks ago, my friend **Alison**, who runs a small independent coffee cart down at the farmer’s market, pulled me aside while I was grabbing my usual oat flat white.

She looked tired — not ""up all night with a new Netflix series"" tired, but the kind that sits behind your eyes.

She told me her feet had been going numb during her early shifts and by noon they were burning like she’d been dancing on coals.

Alison’s always on her feet, shuffling between brewing espresso and chatting with tourists, so this was more than just an inconvenience — it was messing with her livelihood.

She’d already tried **over-the-counter options for nerve pain relief**, but nothing gave her more than a temporary breather.

I mentioned [Nerve Revive 360](https://theworldhealth.org/nerve-revive-360-official) because I’d just started researching it for the blog and figured it was worth a shot. Two weeks in, she sent me a message — said the tingling had toned down, and she’d finally slept through the night without waking up to the weird zaps in her toes.

She’s still taking it and feels hopeful for the first time in months.

Only thing she grumbled about was the size of the capsules. ""They're not horse pills,"" she said, “but I do have to psych myself up a little.” Still, she’d take that over burning feet before lunch any day.

# 🧪 Ingredient Breakdown

The formula combines **supplements that support nerve regeneration** with **natural treatments that work for neuropathy** — a solid 1-2 punch.

**Benfotiamine** helps diabetic nerve pain, and **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is known to tackle **nerve inflammation**, helping reduce that creepy crawling sensation.

**Vitamin B6** and **B12** work quietly behind the scenes, helping balance mood and **repair damaged nerves** without needing caffeine or stimulants.

If you're looking for **foods and supplements that help repair nerves**, this offers a shortcut in a capsule — no kale smoothie needed.

While **home remedies to repair nerve damage** exist, they often take time and consistency. This supplement helps move that process along a bit faster.

# ✅ Pros

🟢 Combines symptom relief with longer-term nerve repair  
🟢 Includes well-known ingredients that support nerve health  
🟢 Free from artificial additives and filler junk

1q2ts9h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2ts9h,My honest review of Blur India perfumes. I finally gave in and got them 😭,"After seeing 5000 ads I picked up these Blur India Smells Like Breakfast perfumes from a sale. Plus they were not expensive so I just got the full size bottles instead of the samplers they have. The box said these require maceration so I left them for 10-12 days. My review is mostly based on a few quick points so I'll highlight them first:

They are 30 ml for Rs 499, so they're in the Plum, Fraganote price range.

All the scents lean gourmand, sweet, and vanilla heavy.

Brand claims they last 6-8 hours, are freshly brewed and require maceration for optimal performance. 

Now for the actual perfumes-

Vanilla Melts is a mix of woody vanilla with a slight fruity touch in the top notes. It says Amberwood but I got more of Sandwal wood in the dry down. It hits just right if you like vanilla scents but are not a fan lf too sweet. It lasts around 6 hours and feels nicely balanced between sweet, musky, and woody. I really liked this one.

Cookie Crumble was a blend of florals and vanilla is subtle but really well done. I feel like I have smelled something similar before. It opens very floral and sweet, then settles into a soft musky kinda vanilla dry down. Lasts over 5 hours on my skin. Easily my favorite and I did not expect to like this one so much. The rant? Why name is cookie crumble when it doesn't smell anything like cookies. Like, it's a great perfume with a very likeable drydown. Why not name it something else.

Coffee Cake smells almost exactly like Khamrah Qahwa. I have the original, and this is a pretty spot on dupe, just slightly sweeter. It performs the best out of the three. Lasted around 9 to 10 hours, with a faint scent still there even after that. Again, doesn't smell like coffee. Doesn't smell like cake. It is an EXACT kamrah qahwa dupe.

Pros and cons:
Very affordable, some of the best looking bottles in the budget category, the charms are a cute addition, good projection, and great lasting power overall. The perfumes smell premium.

Cons would be these DNAs and gourmand sweet scents are already very oversaturated in the market. And the names.

Overall, I would rate these 4 out of 5 for notes, 4.5 out of 5 for packaging, and around 3.5 out of 5 for projection and longevity.",5,1767444413.0,FemFragLab,0,0.78,False

We are living in a Double Bind. This is a situation where you must give your time, attention, and labor to systems that exhaust you just to earn the right to exist. Whether you are gig-working for an algorithm or managing a corporate office, the feeling is the same. You are a subject in someone else’s empire.

This is not a book of wellness tips. I am not here to help you be a more efficient worker or a more mindful consumer. I am here to help you look at the fences. We cannot dismantle a cage we haven’t mapped. I am not writing as an expert who has escaped. I am writing as someone who is learning to breathe through the bars. This is a smuggled map for the rest of us.

The First Enclosure (The Ground Beneath Us)

The first thing the Empire takes is your ground. Before the Warden could own your mind, he had to own the dirt you stand on. This is the history of Enclosure.

For centuries, much of the world was The Commons. These were shared spaces where anyone could gather wood, graze a cow, or find a place to rest. You didn't need a landlord’s permission to exist because the earth wasn't for sale. Then came the fences. In the 1700s, the state began legally fencing off the commons, forcing people into cities to work in factories. If you can’t feed yourself, you have to sell yourself. That was the trade.

The View from My Window

I live in a rented apartment. Every month, I send a large portion of my life-force to a person I’ve never met just so I can have a place to sleep. When I walk outside, the parks have signs telling me when I have to leave. I feel the enclosure in my bank account, but I also feel it in my bones. I am a tenant on my own planet. Acknowledging this isn't radical politics. It is just being honest about the Friction of daily life.

The Friction of the Commons

We shouldn't romanticize the old commons. They were messy. Neighbors argued over water rights and firewood. But they had to talk to each other to solve it. Today, the Empire ""solves"" friction by removing the neighbors. We have Private Property so we don't have to talk to anyone, but the cost is total isolation. Real Steadfastness is the messy work of rebuilding those conversations.

The Millimeter Move

Find one thing in your life that you currently buy and see if a neighbor has it. A ladder? A lawnmower? A cup of sugar? The next time you need it, don't go to the store. Ask. The act of asking is a tiny hole in the fence.

The Second Enclosure (The Mind)

If the first enclosure was about the dirt, the second is about the space between your ears. Once the Warden fenced off the land, he realized he didn't need a physical guard at every gate if he could install one inside your head. This is the Internalized Overseer.

In the modern world, this enclosure is digital and constant. Our attention, our sleep, and our silence are being sold as data. We have been convinced that every waking second must be used. If we aren't working, we are consuming or self-improving. This is the ultimate victory of the cage: when we start to view our own rest as a waste of time and our own minds as factories that must never go dark.

The View from My Window

I find myself reaching for my phone in the three-second gap between finishing a task and starting a new one. It is an itch of the nervous system that cannot bear the weight of being unproductive. I am a person who writes about liberation, yet I am often a slave to my own notifications. I feel the friction of the mind every time I try to sit in a chair for ten minutes without doing something. The anxiety that rises up isn't a medical condition. It is the sound of the Overseer screaming because the factory floor has gone quiet.

The Millimeter Move

Practice the Sovereign Silence. Pick one activity today: washing dishes, walking to the car, or drinking a cup of coffee, and do it without input. No podcast, no music, no scrolling. Just the physical reality of the task. It will feel uncomfortable. That discomfort is the fence. Don’t climb it yet. Just stand there and look at it.

The Architecture of the Cage (The State and The Church)

To dismantle the cage, we have to understand how it was bolted together. It isn’t just held up by police or banks. It is held up by a specific kind of story. This is the theology of the Empire. It is a belief system that explains why some people get to build fences and why the rest of us should be grateful to live inside them.

For centuries, this architecture has relied on two pillars: the State, which manages our bodies, and the Church, which manages our spirits. When they work together, they create a moral reason for extraction. They convince us that our worth is tied to our obedience and that our suffering is just a down payment for a reward in a future that never quite arrives.

The View from My Window

I grew up believing that being good meant being compliant. I thought that if I followed the rules and worked hard, the system would care for me. Facing the Architecture isn't just about hating the government. It is the heartbreaking realization that the structures I trusted were designed to harvest me, not house me. I still feel the urge to ask for permission before I do something radical. That is the ghost of the Church and the State whispering that I am not allowed to be the steward of my own life.

The Friction of the Commons

When we try to build a Sanctuary outside of these systems, we often accidentally bring the Warden with us. We create new groups and immediately start making policies and hierarchies because we don't know how to exist without a Judge. We encounter the Little Tyrant who wants to be the new Priest or the local leader who acts like a mini-Governor. Real Steadfastness is the refusal to call for a manager when things get difficult. It is the hard work of looking a neighbor in the eye and settling a dispute without appealing to an outside authority.

The Machine (Technology and the Enclosure of Time)

The First Enclosure took the land and the Second Enclosure took the mind, but the Machine is designed to take your time. In the logic of the Empire, time is not a flow or a season. It is a series of empty containers that must be filled with value. If you aren't filling those containers, you are wasting your life. This is the factory clock moved from the warehouse wall into the palm of your hand.

The View from My Window

Last night, I caught myself scrolling through a feed of people I don't know, looking at things I don't want, while my actual life sat cold on the table next to me. I felt the Machine’s yield in my thumb. I wasn't relaxing. I was being processed. The Machine tells me that if I just use the right app or the right productivity hack, I can finally get ahead of the clock. But the clock is the Machine’s home turf. You can’t win a race against a treadmill.

The Millimeter Move

Perform an act of Temporal Sabotage. Pick one hour today where you are untrackable. Turn off the phone, step away from the computer, and do something that leaves no digital footprint. Reclaim sixty minutes of your life as a secret.

The Garden (Building the Infrastructure of the Yes)

Resistance that only knows how to destroy eventually runs out of fuel. To survive the long game, we have to build Dual Power. This means creating our own systems for food, care, and safety that make the Empire’s versions obsolete.

The Garden is our metaphor for this new infrastructure. Unlike the Factory, which demands a uniform, predictable yield, the Garden thrives on diversity and patience. When you grow a tomato or join a tool library, you are reclaiming a piece of the commons that was fenced off centuries ago.

The View from My Window

I used to think building the new world was a grand event. Now I think it looks like the shelf of fermented jars in my kitchen or the neighbor who knows where I hide my spare key. My Garden is small and often neglected. But every time I eat something that didn't come from a global supply chain, I feel a strange power. It is the feeling of being a Steward rather than a consumer. The Warden doesn't provide the sun or the soil. He just charges me for the fence.

The Millimeter Move

Find your Node. Don't try to build a whole parallel economy today. Just find one thing you currently rely on the market for. It could be a tool, a skill, or a specific food. Join a local Buy Nothing group or offer a trade to a friend. Move one tiny recurring need out of the Factory and into the Garden.

The Fallow (Rest as Resistance)

In the factory, every square inch must produce a yield. We treat our own lives like a field that must be harvested year-round, never allowing the soil to recover its nutrients. But in nature, nothing blooms all year. There is a season for The Fallow: a time when the ground is left empty to rest. To resist the Empire, we must reclaim the right to be unproductive.

The View from My Window

I am terrible at resting. Even when I am relaxing, I am usually consuming a show or scrolling. I realized that my burnout wasn't just about working too much. It was the fact that I had turned my own soul into a 24/7 production line. Learning to be fallow feels less like a spa day and more like a withdrawal from a drug.

The Millimeter Move

Pick a Fallow Minute. Sometime today, when you feel the urge to check something, stop. Sit for sixty seconds and do absolutely nothing. Don't meditate to improve yourself. Just exist without a purpose. Notice how much the Overseer hates those sixty seconds. That resistance is how you know you’re touching the fence.

The Ethical Shadow

To inhabit the rot, we have to look at what is decomposing within ourselves. There is a second kind of shadow that is much harder to face: the Ethical Shadow. This is the part of us that is deeply entangled with the very systems we claim to despise. We have to admit that while we are victims of the Empire, we are also its beneficiaries.

Our comfort is often bought with someone else’s enclosure. Facing this is not about drowning in guilt. Guilt is a passive, paralyzing emotion that the Empire loves because it keeps you from acting. Radical honesty is different. It is about admitting how much we rely on the Warden’s tools just to survive the Double Bind.

The View from My Window

I spent years feeling like a hypocrite. I would write about The Machine while using a laptop made in a factory that fences its workers in. I realized that the Empire’s greatest trick is making us believe that if we aren't perfectly pure, we aren't allowed to resist. I had to stop trying to be a saint and start being a recovering colonist. I had to forgive myself for surviving so that I could actually start the work of decoupling.

The Millimeter Move

Perform a Gaze of Honesty. Look at one object you use every day: your coffee, your shoes, your phone. Trace its path to you. Don't look for a reason to feel bad. Just look at the reality of the chain. By naming the connection, you break the invisibility that the enclosure relies on.

The Agentic Self (The Sovereign)

To become Sovereign is not to become a king or a hermit in isolation. Sovereignty is the reclamation of your agency. It is the moment you stop being a subject who reacts to the Warden’s whistles and start being an agent who acts from their own center.

We have been trained to outsource our discernment. We ask the Market what we should value and the Algorithm what we should think. Reclaiming the Agentic Self means firing these outside consultants. It means realizing that you are the only one who can decide what your life is for.

The View from My Window

For a long time, I mistook sovereignty for independence. I thought it meant not needing anyone. But that was just the Empire’s rugged individualism in a different costume. My agency was buried under a mountain of ""should."" I was waiting for a permission slip that was never going to come. My first act of true sovereignty was realizing that the Warden isn't going to hand me the keys.

The Millimeter Move

Pick one small decision today that you usually outsource to a default setting. Maybe it is the route you take to work or the way you respond to a standard request. Change it. Do it simply because you chose to.

The Lexicon of the Long Walk

The Double Bind: The impossible situation of modern life. You must participate in the systems that exhaust you just to earn the right to exist. It is the feeling of being forced to pay for your own enclosure.

The First Enclosure (The Land): The historical and ongoing process of turning the shared Earth into private property.

The Second Enclosure (The Mind): The process of fencing off our attention and internal life. The colonization of our silence by digital platforms.

The Machine: The logic of efficiency and yield. The Machine views time as a commodity and humans as biological components in a global production line.

The Warden / The Overseer: The Internalized Overseer is the voice that calls you lazy when you rest. The Warden is the external system of State and Market that manages your body.

Steadfastness: The quiet, stubborn refusal to disappear. The act of staying human when the system wants you to be a subject. It is the commitment to remain present in the friction of reality.

Dual Power: Building parallel systems, like gardens or tool libraries, that meet our needs directly. Making the Empire obsolete.

1q2tqc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q2tqc9/i_wasnt_rented_i_was_grown/,I wasn’t rented. I was grown.,"I found the first camera in the shower this morning. Not a lens. A pupil. Wet. Human. Wired straight into the copper pipe. It blinked when the water hit it. I screamed. It dilated. Watched. Judged.

I didn’t move into 23B. I was harvested.

My name is Sophie Peters. Twenty-nine. Remote worker. Alone. Divorced. I have habits. I line my coffee mugs by size. Stir tea clockwise exactly three times. I jot observations about my commute in a little notebook. They thought they could map me. They were right.

The landlord isn’t a person. He’s a collector.

I found his “maintenance log” behind the fridge. Twelve months of data. My REM cycles. Cortisol spikes. Sleep talking decibels. My menstrual flow. How I squint at screens. How I hum under my breath. My favorite pen. How I smell when I wake. How my heartbeat shifts in quiet rooms.

The walls aren’t pulsing. They mimic my heartbeat. The floor secretes something. Paralytic. Sweet. Metallic. I tried to run. My feet sank. Not wood. Membrane over fat. I felt the previous tenants twitching beneath me, limbs folding like wet paper.

The whispering isn’t a ghost. It’s him. In the walls. In the vents. Breathing. Wet. Patient. Close. He isn’t waiting for me to die. He’s waiting for the apartment to finish printing me.

I looked in the mirror. My reflection didn’t lag. It stepped out. My skin. My face. But perfect. Pores too even. Scar on my knee gone. Smile sharper. Sophie 2.0. Updated. Furnished. Move-in ready.

I remembered the photo I keep taped inside my notebook. Me and my sister, laughing. My reflection didn’t know her. Didn’t know me.

I reached to touch the mirror. My hand passed through. Not glass. It was soft. Warm. My skin melted into it. My veins fizzed, as if the blood inside me was being rewritten. My heart beat. My memories shuffled. My thoughts weren’t mine anymore.

He whispered through the vent. Wet. Jagged. “Don’t struggle. You’re becoming a permanent resident. I promised the next tenant a furnished unit.”

The drywall is crawling over my mouth like a living scab. My fingers fuse into the keys. Plastic softens. Knits into bone. My teeth ache. My eyes are melting. I see him through the keyhole. A small box. My teeth. All of them. Every scar, every imperfection, every memory, every molecule—collected, cataloged, repurposed.

If you’re reading this, put your bare feet on the floor. Warm. Grain like fingerprints. Don’t check the mirror. He’s already started printing you.

I’m at four percent.

I had frequent diarrhea for awhile but I had also recently become a frequent drinker of coffee, energy drink and alcohol with a poor diet in general. 

I was treated with a course of antibiotics. Ct Scans showed it cleared up evidently.

I started seeing a GI who instantly diagnosed Crohn’s. They were presuming it before any evidence. I had an inconclusive colonoscopy that didn’t show evidence. I had a pill cam that also was inconclusive. They diagnosed me on a second colonoscopy.

Throughout the past year, I gradually worsened and worsened with symptoms. I was put on steroids that did nothing. I started skyrizi, which did nothing. I was put on stronger and stronger doses of steroids, which did nothing. Eventually I admitted myself to the ER to find the abscess had returned for god knows how long. I needed a small bowel resection at that point, which I fully blame on listening to my GI and continuing steroid treatment for months instead of just going to the hospital like I would have if I never went to the GI in the first place.

Now they have me on Skyrizi still and I frankly, do not believe the diagnosis and don’t think it’s necessary to be taking this detrimental medication that suppresses my immune system and keeps me locked in a job I hate. I’m considering rolling the dice and waiting to see if I worsen again. 

Once you’re diagnosed, how difficult is it to get another GI to consider the possibility of a false diagnosis? Because I’m on my second and my impression so far is that they just go off what the last guy said because they don’t feel like doing the work. ",0,1767444233.0,CrohnsDisease,5,0.25,False

1q2tpac,https://i.redd.it/13bo7c8pq4bg1.jpeg,Curivari Nights #1: Cafe 52,"Time to go through this Curivari sampler obtained from a friend from overseas. I was interested in Curivari in the quest to find something that fills the Cuban itch without the Cuban availability, quality control, and price pain points, and Curivari is mentioned as one of those brands that might meet that need.

The box isn’t nearly as pretty as the Davidoff sampler, just being a simple slide lid box. However, the cigars are all roughly the same size (ranging from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 length by 50 to 54 ring gauge), so, controlling for size, this sampler is a much closer demonstration of each blend. It’s also unclear to me whether all samplers are the same, or if it’s a mix of some guaranteed cigars and some other random selections - the retailer websites aren’t quite clear.

Even though I’m probably not going to try to do all 10 back-to-back, I still want to take the same approach as with the Davidoff’s by starting mild and working my way up. So I ask ChatGPT for a smoking order for my specific selection and it recommends the following, which I’ll be adopting going forward.

* Cafe 52 - 5 x 52
* Cafe Noir 54 - 5 1/2 x 54
* RL Epicures - 4 1/2 x 52
* Buenaventura BV 500 - 5 1/4 x 50
* RL Reserva 2000 - 5 x 50
* El Gran Rey Belicosos - 5 3/8 x 52
* Gloria de Leon Dominate - 5 1/4 x 54
* SP Robusto - 5 x 50
* Achilles Heroicos - 5 1/4 x 50
* SP Mad Eminentes - 5 1/2 x 52

# The Cafe 52

The cold draw is good. It’s earthy and mild. There’s a flavour on the periphery that i can’t quite pick. ChatGPT suggests that it’s coffee with milk. Which is close but not quite right. 

On the first lit puff, though, yep that’s definitely a flat white with sugar. Quickly behind that comes light leather and wood, and… could it be… almost a ‘twang’? After not too long at all, I was put in the mind of the Bolivar flavour profile. I wasn’t fully sold on Bolivar (and my memory may be playing tricks on me anyway, I’m by no means an expert in picking Cuban brand profiles), but this is better anyway. A while longer, and the coffee becomes more of a mocha.

This is how the cigar continues to smoke for most of the time. Not that it’s one dimensional at all, but it’s like sipping a coffee over a while and getting all the different flavours at different stages of drinking. Sometimes it’s mild and almost milky. Sometimes it’s strong and you can really get the rich flavour. But at no point does it become overwhelming - which as someone who’s generally not a fan of coffee, is a good thing. I can see why it’s called the *Cafe* 52. 

ChatGPT suggested pairing with a coffee, but I don’t think that’s right - the cigar *is* the coffee. If anything, I really want a Biscoff.

In the final third, the flavours started going away and I started getting just a burnt flavour. That could be because I was taking my sweet time with this one (I ended up going nearly 2 hours, which is impressive for a cigar this size) and occasionally having to relight it after I’ve accidentally let it go out, but I think it’s just the nature of this cigar. I don’t quite nub it. 

Overall a very positive start. Not overly strong, but with more than enough to be satisfying. It’s also terribly close to some of the Cubans of similar profile, so I can see why Curivari and Cubanesque are mentioned together. The twang didn’t last, but then, it doesn’t always last in the Cubans either. ",2,1767444161.0,Cigars_Australia,1,1.0,False

Here is what I wish to do be doing on a day to day basis, 

\- Wake up at 8am, no screens for the first hour, sit with a coffee and get washed then try to get some sunlight and just think about the day going forward

\- 9am begin video editing my current project 

\- by 12pm I want to have done 3hrs of meaningful work, at this point i'd like to have a break     for an hour

\- 1pm to 3pm do another 2 hours of editing 

\- 3pm onwards I'm free to do whatever

Here's what happens when i try to do the above

\- Wake up at 8am (check), have a wash and enjoy my coffee (check)

\- 9am i load up my editing software and then i will somehow find a way to do literally anything else that isn't video editing.

Now I've banned gaming during these hours, i've deleted tiktok, I've tried banning so many things. I'll even do other things that previously felt really hard to do like house chores with ease during these hours but ultimately I'm not getting the project done despite it being something i care deeply about.

And then I'll get to around like 1pm and that's when I'll get into panic mode and i'll end up doing a couple hours of work that honestly feels really good and the work done is usually pretty good but this is clearly not a sustainable way to progress. 

I also have a part time job that i don't really love so on days I'm at my part time job i just make sure i get an hour of editing done.

1q2tmn0,https://i.redd.it/jvw17qqtb4bg1.jpeg,Swift for Android? Now You Can Build Full Apps,"Hi everyone, imike here!

On December 31, 2025, right before New Year’s Eve, I released [**Swift Stream IDE**](https://swift.stream) **v1.17.0** and hit a milestone I’ve been working toward since May 2025. This update brings **full native Android application development written entirely in Swift**. That’s right, you can now build Android apps without touching XML, Java, or Kotlin.

If you’ve been following Swift Stream IDE open-source project, you know it already supported Android library development. That was the foundation. Now it’s leveled up to full application development. You can create new projects using familiar Android Studio templates like Empty Activity, Basic Views (two fragments), or Navigation UI (tab bar), and  everything is in Swift.

Under the hood, all projects are powered by [**SwifDroid**](https://github.com/swifdroid/droid), a framework I built to wrap the entire native Android app model. Building it was an incredible journey. There were plenty of pitfalls and rabbit holes inside other rabbit holes, but I was able to realize my full vision for how Android apps should be structured and built in Swift. SwifDroid handles the application lifecycle and manifest, activities and fragments, Android, AndroidX, Material, and Flexbox UI widgets, and even automatically wires Gradle dependencies. Supported SDKs are 28 to 35, and with Swift 6.3, [it might go down](https://forums.swift.org/t/android-api-minimum-for-the-swift-sdk-for-android/82874) to 24+.

Here’s a small example of what UI code looks like:

    ConstraintLayout {
        VStack {
            TextView(""Hello from Swift!"")
                .width(.matchParent)
                .height(.wrapContent)
                .textColor(.green)
            MaterialButton(""Tap Me"")
                .onClick {
                    print(""Button tapped!"")
                }
        }
        .centerVertical()
        .leftToParent()
        .rightToParent()
    }

The first time you create a project, make yourself a cup of tea/coffee. The IDE pulls the Swift toolchain, Android SDK, and NDK, and caches them in Docker volumes. After that, new projects are created instantly. The first build compiles Swift, generates a full Android project (ready to open in Android Studio), and creates a Gradle wrapper. After that, builds take just a few seconds.

Once Swift is compiled, you can simply open the **Application** folder in Android Studio and hit Run or Restart to see your changes. All the necessary files from Swift Stream IDE are already in place, so iteration is fast and seamless.

This is the **first public release**. Android is huge, and there are still widgets in progress, but the system is real and usable today. You can immediately start building Swift-powered Android applications.

About me:

25-year-old gurlie currently living in QC. Within above normal BMI though I stand at 5’4”. I’ve already lost weight and been steadily shedding off pa. I wouldn’t consider myself conventionally-attractive, but I am particular about hygiene and have been called cute a few times, and I’m not unfortunate-looking either. I think I look decent enough. I like being active and eating healthy. 

I try to have a life outside my work: Kahit busy, I make time for my hobbies. I’m a huge reader (let’s trade book recs!) and I’m a sucker for anything cute. If it’s pink, fluffy, or a blind box, it’s coming home with me.

I’m low maintenance (relationship-wise), since I spend most of my time on duty, I appreciate the little things, a thoughtful text, a quick snack or coffee run, or just sitting in silence while we both do our own thing.

What I’m looking for:

Someone who is emotionally mature and has a life of their own. I love hearing about things I don't know (non-med topics are very welcome!). Since it’s December and going into another year, let’s go on a low-pressure date. Pwedeng arcade, bookshop crawl, or just a quiet dinner where we can talk about everything and nothing.

I’d prefer someone older but the same age is okay, too! Just not someone younger, I guess?

If we do hit it off, I’d love to see you as a semi-permanent (or permanent?) presence at my place. There to wait for me at the end of every shift, where we can just yap about anything and everything, or maybe just sit in silence as we enjoy each other’s presence.

The catch:

My memory is bad, and my sleep schedule is worse. If you can handle a med gurlie who smells like rubbing alcohol but has the heart of a cozy gamer, then we’ll get along just fine.

Looking for some help or shared experiences — because this upgrade hasn’t gone how I expected.

I’m not chasing acidity or complex fruity profiles. I just want **smooth, chocolatey, sweet, full-bodied espresso with good crema** — something in the **classic Italian style**, comforting and low-acid but not too bitter.

I started with a **Sage Barista Express Impress**. It was okayish but not amazing. Once I paired it with a **DF83V grinder**, the results got pretty good — probably about **80% of what I was aiming for**: low acidity, full body, chocolate/nutty notes. Not super complex, but easy and enjoyable.

Since the Sage is an all-in-one, I didn’t love having a big grinder sitting next to it. I figured if I was getting that close to great espresso with a limited machine, **upgrading to a Lelit Mara X** would bring me the **final 20% of quality** I was missing.

Well… it didn’t.

**The result?**

Now I consistently get **thin, bitter, and hollow** shots from beans I used to enjoy — like **Omkafè Diamante** and **Illy Red**.

Even with super fresh local specialty coffee from Germany (100% Brazilian Arabica from Coffee Circle or Classic Blend from LF Coffee with 80% brazil Arabica and 20% indian Robusta ), I get **technically better shots** — some sweetness and caramel — but still **not satisfying** as they still lack body and have an harsh bitterness.

I’ve tried almost everything: different grind sizes, temps, doses, yields, RPMs…  
I’ve cleaned the machine, tested a full range of recipes, installed a grouphead thermometer, and prep with WDT and a calibrated tamper.

**My setup:**

* **Machine:** Lelit Mara X V2 (brew priority mode)
* **Grinder:** DF83V (usually 800 RPM)
* **Water:** Volvic or Brita-filtered
* **Temp:** Measured at grouphead with E61 sensor → **92°C on Level 0**
* **Prep:** Normcore WDT + MHW-3BOMBER Flash Tamper
* **Typical Recipe:** 18g in → 36g out → \~30 sec (DF83V @ 23)
* **Pump pressure:** Factory setting, measuring 9 bar on grouphead gauge with blind filter

**How I prepare my shots:**

* I let the machine heat up for at least 30 minutes (light stops flashing after approx 15-20). The idle group temp shows around 82–85°C, but when I start brewing, it quickly ramps to \~92–93°C within a few seconds.
* I usually flush for 2–3 seconds before the shot (though I’ve tested without flushing — not much difference).
* I grind into a dosing cup, transfer into the stock Lelit double basket, roughly level the grounds, then use WDT to evenly distribute.
* Tamp with the calibrated tamper, then start the shot.

The machine starts low-pressure (preinfusion), then ramps up to 9 bar.  
But the big difference to other machines I noticed is:

The first drops appear only after \~10–12 seconds which is much slower than what I was used to on previous machines (where it was more like 5–7 sec).  
I’m starting to think this long preinfusion is hurting my shot — maybe over-extracting up front or muddying the flavor?

**My thoughts:**

* The grinder isn’t the issue — it gave solid results on the Sage.
* The puck always comes out clean, intact, and dry — no mush, no cracks, no clear signs of channeling. So prep seems good.
* The machine isn’t broken, but maybe it’s just not ideal for traditional-style blends.
* The Sage may have flattened the flavor, but somehow it made those coffees taste better to me.

IMO The Mara X  is a great machine, but so far, my shots are worse — not better.

**Looking for help:**

* Has anyone else had a similar experience ?
* Could the long preinfusion and late first-drop be causing this?
* Any tips or recipe I could try ?
* Do **traditional-style blends** (like Omkafè, Illy) just not work well on machines like the Mara X?
* Any recommended **roasters in Germany/EU** that offer Italian-style flavor but roast for modern gear?

Thanks for reading — would really appreciate any insight. Maybe you can help me turn this around and finally enjoy espresso again ☕🙏

And it seems like Mad Men a closer reflection of racism in and around major cities in New York. 

The racism might not be as brutal as shown in shows set in the South, but even a metropolitan city such as NYC, racism is prevalent, and has different layers as well. Just a few examples 

1) For example, when Paul brought his GF along, you can see the clear disgust on Allison's face. Allison seemingly a 'nice girl'. 

2) Companies know about the emerging black market for Admiral tvs, but they don't want to be known as a 'black tv company' so refuse to go with Pete's plan 

3) Joan disrupting Paul's relationship for kicks. Yes she thought Paul was being a fake, but the way she went about it was nasty. 

4) Peggy believing her situation was the same that of black people in the 1960s, stating they have to earn a place in the office just like her. Same time when there would be people who would not drink from the same cup used by a black person. 

5) The straight up black face by Roger 

6) 'Black coffee over there'

7) Using an Asian family for a joke

1q2tgtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1q2tgtj/i_practiced_flirting_with_women_for_30_days_and/,I practiced flirting with women for 30 days and here's what actually worked (and what spectacularly failed),"I've always been the guy who freezes up around attractive women. The guy who thinks of the perfect thing to say 3 hours later. The guy watching others effortlessly create connection and chemistry while I stand awkwardly in the corner wondering what secret handbook everyone else received at birth.

So I decided to run an experiment: 30 days of deliberate flirting practice. No pickup lines or manipulation tactics just genuine interactions with a specific focus on building romantic tension and expressing interest clearly. I committed to at least one flirtatious interaction daily, tracked what happened, and documented patterns.

What followed was equal parts humbling, educational, and occasionally mortifying. But by day 30, something had fundamentally shifted in how I communicate with women I'm attracted to.

Here's what I learned:

Days 1-7: The awkward phase

My first week was a masterclass in what NOT to do. In my head, I sounded smooth. In reality, I was a human cringe compilation.

Day 1: Tried complimenting a barista on her earrings and somehow ended up in a three-minute monologue about my aunt's jewelry collection. She looked genuinely concerned for my wellbeing.

Day 4: Attempted ""playful teasing"" with a woman at the gym. Called her form ""interesting"" during kettlebell swings. She thought I was a trainer about to correct her technique. When I clarified I was flirting, she just said ""Oh"" and walked away. After that I was considered moving to another country (IT WAS EMBARASSING!)

The first week pattern was clear: I was overthinking, overtalking, and overcomplicated everything. I was treating flirtation like a performance rather than a conversation.

Days 8-14: The learning period

During week two, I noticed my first substantial shifts by making one critical change: I stopped thinking about what to say and focused entirely on how to listen.

Day 9: Had a conversation with a woman at a bookstore about the novel she was holding. Instead of trying to impress her with my literary knowledge, I asked genuine questions about what drew her to that author. The conversation flowed naturally for 15 minutes, ending with her suggesting a coffee shop nearby.

Day 12: Made eye contact with a woman at the farmer's market, smiled, then commented on the unique tomatoes she was selecting. Instead of immediately launching into conversation, I let comfortable silence exist between comments. The interaction had a completely different rhythm relaxed, dynamic, and mutually engaged.

The winning formula started becoming clear: curiosity + presence + patience = chemistry. I was learning that flirtation isn't about what you say but the energy you create.

Days 15-22: Earned confidence

By mid-experiment, patterns were emerging about what consistently worked versus what consistently failed.

What consistently failed:

* Anything that felt like a ""line"" or prepared statement
* Complimenting physical appearance as an opener
* Trying to demonstrate value or intelligence
* Any interaction where I was focused on the outcome rather than the moment

What consistently worked:

* Genuine observations about something in our shared environment
* Playful (but kind) banter that created emotional ping-pong
* Light, brief touch at appropriate moments (like a touch on the arm during laughter)
* Comfortable silence with maintained eye contact

The biggest revelation came on Day 19 at a friend's dinner party. I realized I was no longer ""practicing flirting"" I was just connecting with people while allowing attraction to exist without hiding it. My friend later told me that a woman had asked about me after the party, something that had rarely happened before.

Days 23-30: The outcome phase

The final week brought a profound insight: Effective flirting isn't a separate communication mode it's regular conversation with the volume turned up on certain elements:

* More precise eye contact
* Slightly more personal questions
* More expressive reactions to their stories
* More comfort with silence
* More willingness to show vulnerability mixed with confidence

Day 26: Had lunch next to a woman at a café counter. Our conversation flowed from weather to travel to life philosophies without effort. When we eventually exchanged numbers, it felt like the natural next step rather than a nerve-wracking goal. What differed wasn't what I said but how comfortable I was expressing authentic interest.

Day 30: Went to a social event and found myself flirting effortlessly with multiple women throughout the evening. Not because I was trying to ""score"" but because I'd developed a comfort with expressing attraction as part of normal human interaction. All those cringe moments became worth it.

After 30 days, hundreds of interactions, and meticulous tracking of what worked and what didn't, here are the most valuable insights I gained:

1. Intention Is Loud

Women can sense the difference between someone talking to them because they're generally interesting versus someone talking to them with an agenda. The interactions that went well were ones where I was genuinely curious rather than outcome-focused.

2. Tension needs space

Early on, I'd fill every silence with more words. I later realized that romantic tension actually lives in the spaces between words the brief eye contact, the slight smile, the unspoken understanding. Allowing these moments to breathe was game-changing.

3. Escalation is subtle

Effective flirting is about small shifts in proximity, personal disclosure, and playfulness. The most powerful connections happened through a series of micro-escalations that were almost imperceptible individually but significant collectively.

4. Rejection is information, not failure

Early rejections sent me into spirals of self-criticism. Later rejections simply became data points. Not everyone will be attracted to you, and that's valuable information that saves everyone's time.

5. Inner state trumps technique

The single biggest factor in successful interactions wasn't what I said but how I felt saying it. On confident, grounded days, even mundane conversations developed chemistry. On insecure days, even my best material fell flat.

Would I recommend this challenge?

Absolutely but with caveats. Just make sure to not quit after the 1st week because it's the hardest to overcome especially with self-criticism but after that it's a fun experience to have. We only live once after all,

The true transformation wasn't becoming ""better at flirting"" but becoming more comfortable with myself in romantic contexts. The awkwardness never completely disappears (and honestly, a little awkwardness can be endearing), but the fear around it does.

When you stop seeing flirting as a performance and start seeing it as enhanced human connection, something clicks into place that changes not just your dating life but your relationship with yourself.

Has anyone else tried something similar? What did you learn about yourself in the process? Well I realized women are also humans (lol) and that it's all a numbers game and it's all practice",39,1767443397.0,LockedInMan,7,0.87,False

I’m 25 and for the past 7 years I’ve lived entirely inside my comfort zone. Never took risks. Never tried new things. Never pushed myself. Just stayed safe and comfortable while life happened around me.

My comfort zone was tiny. Same job, same routine, same apartment, same foods, same activities, same everything. If something was outside that zone, I didn’t do it.

Everyone else was taking chances. Trying new careers, moving to new cities, learning new skills, meeting new people, having experiences. Living life.

I stayed in my bubble. Safe. Comfortable. Unchanging. Watched seven years disappear while I did the exact same things over and over.

Now I’m 25 and I’ve experienced nothing. Built nothing. Tried nothing. Just seven years of the same safe comfortable routine while everyone else actually lived.

The worst part is I knew what I was doing. Every time an opportunity came up I’d think about it, feel the discomfort, and choose safety. Seven years of choosing comfort over living.

# What my comfort zone looked like

Got a job at a bookstore right after high school. $12/hour shelving books and running register. Easy, quiet, comfortable. No challenge, no growth, just safe.

Worked there for seven years. Same position, same tasks, same routine. Manager would offer me supervisor roles. I’d decline. Too far outside my comfort zone.

Coworkers would leave for better jobs. I’d stay. Leaving meant uncertainty and discomfort. Staying was safe even if I was going nowhere.

Lived in the same studio apartment for seven years. $750/month. Small and outdated but comfortable and familiar. Moving meant change. Too uncomfortable.

Ate the same foods. Same restaurants, same meals, same routine. Never tried new cuisines or restaurants. Too far outside comfort zone.

Had the same three friends from high school. Never made new ones. Meeting new people meant discomfort. Easier to stick with familiar.

Never traveled. Never left my state. Friends would plan trips and invite me. I’d make excuses. Really I just didn’t want to leave my comfort zone.

Routine was identical every day. Wake up, same breakfast, work, same lunch, home, same dinner, same shows, sleep, repeat. Seven years of the exact same routine.

Never learned anything new. No classes, no skills, no hobbies. Learning meant being bad at something first. Too uncomfortable. Stayed with what I knew.

Never dated. Hadn’t been on a date in seven years. Dating meant vulnerability and rejection risk. Way outside comfort zone. Easier to stay single.

Never took any risks. Professional, social, personal. If there was any chance of failure or discomfort, I avoided it.

My life at 25 was identical to my life at 18. Same job, same apartment, same routine, same everything. Seven years and nothing changed because I never left my comfort zone.

# What I missed by staying comfortable

While I was in my comfort zone, life was happening around me.

My friend Jake took a risk and moved to Denver with no job lined up. Found work, built a new life, had adventures. Took a chance outside his comfort zone.

I stayed in my studio apartment in the same city I’d always lived. Safe. Comfortable. Boring.

My friend Sarah quit her job to go back to school. Risky and uncomfortable. Now she’s a physical therapist making $70k doing work she loves.

I stayed at the bookstore making $12/hour. Safe. Comfortable. Going nowhere.

My coworker Mike started learning photography. Was terrible at first. Stuck with it. Now he does it professionally on weekends making extra income.

I never learned anything new. Too uncomfortable to be bad at something. Stayed with what I knew. Missed the growth.

Friend Emma went to Europe alone. Traveled for 2 months. Had experiences and stories. Pushed way outside her comfort zone.

I never traveled. Never left my state. Too uncomfortable. Missed all those experiences.

Everyone was dating, having relationships, some getting engaged. Living.

I stayed single. Dating meant risk of rejection. Too uncomfortable. Missed connection.

Seven years of watching everyone else live while I stayed comfortable and safe. They were collecting experiences. I was collecting nothing.

# The moment I realized what I’d lost

This was about 4 months ago. Got invited to a birthday dinner for a friend from high school. Almost didn’t go. Social events slightly outside my comfort zone.

But I went. Sat at a table with people I’d graduated with seven years ago.

They were talking about their lives. Adventures they’d had. Risks they’d taken. Experiences that shaped them. Stories from living.

Someone asked me what I’d been up to. I said working at the bookstore still. They asked where I’d traveled. Said I hadn’t. Asked what hobbies I had. Said nothing really.

They asked if I was seeing anyone. No. Living anywhere new? No. Learning anything? No. Doing anything different? No.

Had nothing to contribute. Seven years of my life and I had zero stories. Zero experiences. Zero growth. Nothing.

Everyone else had lived seven years. I’d spent seven years in my comfort zone doing nothing.

The contrast was brutal. They’d taken risks and had lives to show for it. I’d stayed safe and had nothing.

Drove home realizing I’d wasted seven years being comfortable while life passed by. Everyone else was living. I was just existing in a bubble.

# Why I stayed in my comfort zone

Had to figure out why I’d wasted seven years never leaving comfort.

Realized I was terrified of discomfort. Any situation that might be awkward, difficult, or uncertain felt wrong. My brain interpreted discomfort as danger.

So I avoided everything outside my tiny zone. New job? Uncomfortable. New city? Uncomfortable. New people? Uncomfortable. New experiences? Uncomfortable. Avoid all of it.

Also I was scared of failure and judgment. If I tried new things I might fail. People might judge me. Easier to never try. Can’t fail if you never leave comfort.

Had convinced myself comfort was enough. That a simple safe life was fine. That I didn’t need adventure or growth or experiences.

Really I was just scared. Hiding in comfort because the alternative felt too risky.

My comfort zone felt safe but it was actually a prison. Keeping me from living while I told myself I was fine.

# What finally pushed me out

After that dinner I couldn’t ignore it anymore. Seven years of staying comfortable had cost me everything. Experiences, growth, memories, life.

If I stayed comfortable another seven years, at 32 I’d still be at that bookstore having done nothing. While everyone else continued living, I’d still be hiding.

That future terrified me more than leaving comfort.

Was on reddit and found a post about someone who’d lived in their comfort zone for a decade. They said the only way out was forced exposure to discomfort through structured systems.

Found this app called Reload. Downloaded it.

It asked about my comfort zone. What’s inside it, what scares you about leaving it, what have you missed by staying in it.

Was honest. Said my comfort zone is my routine, apartment, job, same friends. Scared of failure, judgment, uncertainty. Missed experiences, growth, relationships, life.

It built a 60 day program focused on progressive comfort zone expansion. Week 1 tasks were small steps outside comfort. Try one new restaurant. Talk to one stranger. Apply to one new job. Take a different route to work.

Tiny steps but outside my zone. Also blocked my comfort activities during certain hours. No familiar shows. No routine meals. Forced to try new things.

Week 1 every task felt wrong. My brain wanted familiar and comfortable. But I did them. One new restaurant. One conversation with a stranger at a coffee shop. Applied to one bookstore job in a different location.

Small discomfort but I’d left my zone.

# Week 1-8 (small expansions)

Week 1 felt terrible. Everything new felt wrong. My brain wanted to retreat to comfort immediately.

But I kept doing the tasks. New restaurant was fine. Conversation with stranger was awkward but survived. Different route to work showed me parts of town I’d never seen.

Week 2 tasks increased. Try two new activities. Attend one social event. Apply to three jobs outside bookstores.

Tried a rec sports league. Uncomfortable as hell. Went to a meetup event. Awkward. Applied to retail jobs at other stores. All small expansions.

Week 3 got an interview at a different store. Electronics retail. $16/hour. More responsibility. Outside comfort zone. Pushed through interview anxiety. Got the job.

Week 4 started new job. Everything unfamiliar. New people, new tasks, new environment. Wanted to quit and go back to bookstore. Forced myself to stay.

Week 5 tasks added traveling. Plan one weekend trip somewhere new. Booked a trip to a city 2 hours away. Stayed one night. Small trip but outside my zone.

Week 6 the weekend trip was uncomfortable. New city, navigating alone, uncertainty. But I did it. Had an experience. Something to remember.

Week 7 started noticing my comfort zone was expanding. Things that felt impossible week 1 felt manageable. New job was becoming familiar.

Week 8 tasks added social expansion. Attend three social events this week. Join one new group or club. Make plans with someone new.

Went to events. Joined a book club. Made plans with a coworker. All uncomfortable. All expanding my zone.

# Week 9-16 (major expansion)

Week 9 my manager at new job asked if I wanted to train for assistant manager. More responsibility and pressure. Old me would’ve said no. Said yes.

Week 10 the training was uncomfortable. Leadership, decision making, pressure. Way outside comfort zone. But pushing through.

Week 11 tasks added bigger risks. Plan a major change. Apply to dream jobs. Sign up for something scary.

Applied to jobs I thought I wasn’t qualified for. Marketing roles. Office positions. $40k+ salaries. Way outside bookstore comfort zone.

Week 12 went on my first date in seven years. Girl from the book club. Terrifying. Pushed through. Went well. Went on a second date.

Week 13 got called for interviews for better jobs. Prepared even though I felt unqualified. Went to interviews. Uncomfortable but necessary.

Week 14 got an offer. Marketing assistant at a small company. $42k. No experience required, they’d train. Way outside comfort zone. Accepted.

Week 15 quit retail. Started the marketing job. Everything new and overwhelming. Learning constantly. Uncomfortable daily. But living.

Week 16 booked a real trip. Flight to another state. Solo travel for a week. Huge expansion of comfort zone.

# Where I am now

It’s been 5 months since that dinner. My life is unrecognizable.

Working the marketing job making $42k. Learning constantly. Uncomfortable but growing. Nothing like the stagnant bookstore years.

Moved to a better apartment in a different neighborhood. $1100/month but worth it. New environment forced new routines.

Dating someone I met through expanding my social circle. Relationship means vulnerability. Uncomfortable but worth it.

Traveled to 3 different states in 5 months. More travel than seven years in comfort zone. Building experiences and memories.

Made new friends through trying new activities. Book club, sports league, work friends. Actual social expansion.

Trying new things constantly. New restaurants, new hobbies, new experiences. Comfortable being uncomfortable now.

Most importantly I’m living instead of hiding. Seven years of comfort got me nothing. Five months of leaving comfort got me a life.

My family noticed. My mom said I seem excited about things for the first time in years. My old friends said I’m different, more engaged.

Can’t get back seven years of staying comfortable. But I’m not wasting more years hiding.

# What I learned

Comfort zones shrink when you stay in them. Mine became tiny after seven years. Everything outside felt impossible.

Life happens outside your comfort zone. All experiences, growth, memories happen when you leave safety.

Staying comfortable feels safe but costs you everything. Seven years of comfort got me nothing. Everyone else living got them everything.

You can’t expand your zone by thinking about it. Have to actually do uncomfortable things. Exposure is the only way.

Small steps outside comfort compound. Week 1 trying a new restaurant. Week 16 traveling solo to new states. Built gradually.

Discomfort becomes comfortable with exposure. New job was terrifying week 1. Week 8 it was familiar. Adaptation happens.

Everyone who’s living pushed through discomfort repeatedly. No comfortable path to experiences and growth.

# If you’re stuck in your comfort zone

Look at what you’ve missed by staying comfortable. Experiences, relationships, growth, memories. Is comfort worth that cost?

Accept that expansion requires discomfort. No way around it. Staying comfortable keeps you stuck.

Start with tiny steps. One new restaurant. One conversation with stranger. One new activity. Build from there.

Get external structure. App like Reload that forces small expansions progressively. Can’t trust yourself to leave comfort voluntarily.

Block comfortable defaults. Can’t retreat to familiar when uncomfortable if familiar isn’t available.

Track expansion. Notice your zone growing. Things that felt impossible become manageable.

Remember that everyone living left their comfort zone repeatedly. You can too.

Give it time. Took me 5 months to expand significantly. Can’t rush comfort zone growth.

Five months ago I was 25 with seven years in my comfort zone having experienced nothing. Now I’m actually living.

Seven years wasted being comfortable. But not wasting more.

Stop hiding in comfort. Start living.

What’s one thing outside your comfort zone you’re going to do today?

P.S. If you’re reading this thinking your comfort zone is fine, look at what everyone around you is doing. They’re living. You’re hiding. That difference compounds every single day you stay comfortable.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1767442908.0,Habits,1,0.67,False

One of his main complaints is that I “ask too much” and comment on his behavior too often.

Basically what happened:
We were at his place, just chilling and having coffee. I was planning to leave not long after. Suddenly, he stands up and says, “Oh well, I wanna use my computer now,” and just sits down at it, basically shutting me out. I told him, “Hey, that feels kinda rude to me. Could you wait like an hour until I’ve left?”
That simple comment turned into a full-blown argument..

When we talked a few days later, he said he should be allowed to do whatever he wants and that it’s unreasonable for me to comment on little things like that. He says I’m too emotional and nagging, especially over small stuff.
From my perspective, it feels normal to tell your partner when something they do hurts your feelings. I wasn’t trying to control him, just explain how it made me feel. Instead, I ended up feeling kind of gaslit for even bringing it up.

Another example, is that he once got annoyed with me, when i asked him to call me because i was sick and we couldn’t see eachother.
So AITAH for calling out behavior that felt rude to me, or was I actually asking too much?

tl;dr: My boyfriend and I broke up after a big fight. He says I comment too much on his behavior. One example was him ignoring me to use his computer while I was visiting, and I said it felt rude.
