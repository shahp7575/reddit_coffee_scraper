But just like a team leader or a head of the company, Self doesn't have to do everything or even know everything, right? For example, I most certainly have a part that does my morning routine (making my bed, washing face, teeth, dressing, making coffee and breakfast) even before I'm fully awake. I don't feel that the Self is involved with that routine, it's all habit at this point. Is that OK? 

But isn't the goal of IFS therapy to be more Self-led and that means having more Self presence in everyday life. These habitual ways of doing things are the exact opposite of mindful presence IMHO. But that then leads me to another dilemma: Can the Self get overwhelmed by too many inputs (parts), just like a real CEO would if half the company got into his office? From the IFS theory I read, the Self has an almost infinite amount of energy and those C qualities. But then why do we need parts if the Self is so great? 

I guess what I'm asking is: where is the delineation between parts and the Self? My Intellectualizing part is really stuck on this and cannot move forward until this clicks cognitively for it... ",1,1733428916.0,InternalFamilySystems,0,1.0,False

*Introduction: To the Moon and Beyond!*  
Remember when people laughed at the idea of Bitcoin hitting $1,000? Then $10,000? Fast forward to today, and we‚Äôre staring down the barrel of $100,000 Bitcoin like it‚Äôs the next logical step. But what happens when the price of one Bitcoin can buy you a Tesla, a family vacation, and still leave enough for fancy sushi? The key to riding this crypto rocket isn‚Äôt just hodling‚Äîit‚Äôs being prepared for the digital age. And that‚Äôs where **our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in.

Let‚Äôs dive into the world of six-figure Bitcoin and how our app helps you flex, transact, and thrive in this exciting new frontier.

# Bitcoin at $100K: Living the Digital Dream

Imagine this: You‚Äôre sitting at your favorite caf√©. The barista hands you a latte, and instead of fumbling with a card or cash, you whip out your phone. With one scan of a QR code, your Bitcoin wallet sends payment in seconds. That‚Äôs the future‚Äîfast, efficient, and gloriously decentralized.

At $100,000 per Bitcoin, Satoshis (the smallest Bitcoin unit) become the new pennies. Instead of paying 0.0001 BTC, you‚Äôre dealing with terms like ‚Äú10,000 sats.‚Äù This shift means you need tools that make crypto transactions as smooth as your latte foam. Enter our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**‚Äîyour digital wallet‚Äôs best friend.

# What Makes a Bitcoin QR Code So Powerful?

Let‚Äôs get nerdy for a second. A Bitcoin QR code condenses complicated alphanumeric wallet addresses into a scannable graphic that even a monkey could use (no offense to monkeys). Whether you‚Äôre receiving payment for freelance work, splitting a bill, or collecting donations for your *‚ÄúBitcoin Moon Party‚Äù*, QR codes simplify the process.

And we make generating those QR codes ridiculously easy. Here‚Äôs why our app stands out:

1. **Fast and Free**: You don‚Äôt need to be a tech wizard. Our app churns out QR codes faster than Bitcoin memes go viral.
2. **Customizable**: Add flair to your QR codes with custom colors or logos. Who says crypto can‚Äôt be stylish?
3. **Secure**: No one wants to lose funds because of a typo. QR codes ensure error-free transactions every time.

# How Our App Makes $100K Bitcoin Practical

Sure, owning Bitcoin at $100K is cool, but spending it is even cooler. Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app helps you do just that, whether you‚Äôre transacting in micro or macro amounts. Here‚Äôs how:

# 1. Crypto Commerce Made Easy

Got a side hustle? Maybe you‚Äôre selling NFTs, offering tutoring, or hawking handmade crypto merch. Our app lets you generate QR codes to accept Bitcoin payments directly into your wallet. No middlemen, no sky-high fees‚Äîjust sweet, decentralized money.

# 2. Send and Receive Like a Pro

Have you ever tried reading a 34-character Bitcoin wallet address aloud? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 1FzWL‚Ä¶ uh, is that a lowercase L or a 1?‚Äù Skip the headache. Our QR codes let you send and receive Bitcoin with a simple scan.

# 3. Perfect for Parties (and Flexing)

Hosting a party to celebrate Bitcoin‚Äôs new milestone? Slap a donation QR code on the invitation. Guests can chip in sats instead of cash. Or better yet, print it on a cake‚Äîbecause nothing says ‚ÄúBitcoin boss‚Äù like eating your own QR code.

# $100K Bitcoin and Beyond: Why You Need to Adapt

At six figures, Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just for tech nerds or libertarians anymore. It‚Äôs mainstream. And with great popularity comes great responsibility‚Äîto make it usable for everyone. QR codes bridge the gap between crypto veterans and newcomers.

Imagine onboarding your grandma into Bitcoin. She might struggle with ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù and ‚Äúmining,‚Äù but show her a QR code and she‚Äôs ready to roll. Our app isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs the translator that makes Bitcoin universal.

# Fun Ways to Use Bitcoin QR Codes

Life‚Äôs too short to be boring, especially when you‚Äôre dealing with a $100K Bitcoin. Here are some fun and creative ways to use our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app:

1. **Tipping Jar of the Future** Are you a streamer, artist, or musician? Add a Bitcoin QR code to your content and watch the sats roll in. Who needs fiat tips when you can stack sats?
2. **Treasure Hunts** Create a scavenger hunt with QR codes leading to hidden Bitcoin rewards. It‚Äôs like geocaching but way cooler (and potentially profitable).
3. **Crypto Fundraisers** Whether it‚Äôs for a good cause or a personal project, a Bitcoin QR code makes donating easy. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love a campaign called *‚ÄúTo the Moon Together‚Äù*?
4. **Share the Wealth** Got a friend who‚Äôs new to crypto? Generate a QR code for a tiny amount of Bitcoin and send it as a gift. It‚Äôs like giving someone their first stock in the form of digital gold.

# The Road to $100K and Why Simplicity Wins

Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to $100K isn‚Äôt just about price; it‚Äôs about usability. The more accessible Bitcoin becomes, the faster we onboard the masses. Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker app is a small but crucial piece of this puzzle.

Think of it this way: QR codes are the ‚Äúpoint-and-click‚Äù of the crypto world. They remove barriers, making Bitcoin as easy to use as your favorite app. At $100K, the stakes are higher, but the tools don‚Äôt have to be complicated.

# Why Choose [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)?

Sure, there are other QR code generators out there. But why settle for generic when you can have the best? Here‚Äôs what sets us apart:

* **100% Bitcoin-Focused**: We don‚Äôt mess around with other blockchains. It‚Äôs all about Bitcoin, all the time.
* **User-Friendly**: If you can use a smartphone, you can use our app. Period.
* **Completely Free**: No hidden fees, no nonsense‚Äîjust pure crypto goodness.

# The Future is QR-ific

As Bitcoin soars past $100K, the world will change. Crypto will no longer be a niche interest but a way of life. From buying coffee to paying rent, QR codes will power the revolution. And our app ensures you‚Äôre ready for it.

So, what are you waiting for? Start generating Bitcoin QR codes today and become a Satoshi superstar. Whether you‚Äôre stacking sats, spending Bitcoin, or just showing off, our app has your back. Check it out at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and take the first step into the $100K future.

My phone 13 mini was on its last legs: cracked screen & dented side from a bad drop while I was on a scooter, and it had a bad battery. So I bought an iPhone 16 Pro yesterday, but I found it incredibly cumbersome to use one handed, which is super important to me. 

The 16 pro camera was excellent, but the mini's is pretty good as-is. Another of my justifications--that I would see more content on a screen turned out to be unjustified: most apps just scale up and you see exactly the same amount of content on the larger 16 pro as the 13 mini (most apps don't respond to the dynamic text sizing).

Today, I decided I would get my iPhone 13 mini repaired at the nearby Apple store, and I was quoted $118 for battery ($89) and screen ($29). Great! 

Turns out it was considered too damaged to repair--with a crack on the front/back and a dent on the side--so they just gave me a brand new iphone 13 mini for $99.

So happy I get to keep this form factor for a few more years. I used my iPhone one handed EVERYWHERE--on the subway, while sipping a coffee and scrolling. The need to drop my hands and occasionally go two-handed completely messed up my flow.",3,1733428686.0,iPhone13Mini,2,1.0,False

I just scheduled my consult for the end of the month. I can Google all day but figured just asking a community would help. 

A brief PMH: I'm 38 with 4 teens. In Fall of 2016, I was 220lbs and started phentermine to help with weight loss. Had great results until I plateaued at 180/185 about a year in. An increase in dosing and more lifestyle changes didn't seem to help. And then I went through a divorce and by Jan of 2019, I was down to 150lbs and went back up to 170-180 range by November 2021. By January 2023, I was back to 220lbs. 

So I tried phentermine again and even with dosing increases, got stuck at 190lbs. I went off of it in May 2023 and now I'm up to my heaviest at 235lbs. 

My diet is generally healthy and didn't fluctuate much with any of the times I've been on phentermine or without. I utilize portion control and intuitively balance my protein/carbs/fats. I stick to carbonated water, herbal teas, and 1 cup of coffee a day. I mindfully snack. The fluke during my divorce was me surviving on less than 1000 calories a day 90% of the time which isn't sustainable

I do have a desk job technically but I try to get up and walk every hour. I work in a hospital so there's a lot of area to walk. 

I have a history of GERD and the intensity and frequency has been worsening over the last year. I have moderate sleep apnea. My cholesterol levels are an issue even with limiting my red meat intake. 

I just don't want this consult to be a waste of my time and make me feel hopeless. 

I mean, yeah I'd like to look great in clothes and feel good about my physical self but honestly...I just want to not be in pain after walking and be able to use stairs without getting out of breath and I'm worried about all the co morbidities with diabetes and heart disease running in my family. 

My biggest question is, aside from if anyone around the same height and weight can give me an idea of what to expect weight loss wise....

Does my charged history with weight loss over the last 10 years help with proving I've been unsuccessful since the moment I'm off a stimulant, I just go right back to gaining weight again? 

Im willing to make the changes to have WLS be successful. The phentermine just made me feel like a failure because I couldn't understand why that medication was the only thing keeping my weight under control. ",1,1733428367.0,wls,0,1.0,False

1h7hz7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1h7hz7h/reminder_eating_a_western_diet_is_expensive/,Reminder: Eating a Western Diet Is Expensive,"Even though we're dealing with different food expenses than elsewhere in the world, and sometimes highly processed foods are the cheapest per pound, I thought I'd share a few strategies along the lines of changing the way many of us were raised to eat. It can be a very cheap and satisfying change when you look at your overall food spending.

1. Eat less meat. Meat is often the most expensive part of a meal, and the Western diet has us consuming a LOT of it. Make some meals totally vegetarian. Substitute a few shrimp, tofu, beans, or a piece of tilapia for more expensive meats and seafoods. Not all the time, but diversify each week's meals. And when you do use meat, consider dishes that use it more as a seasoning. When it really is the ""main attraction,"" you could just have one small piece, and try adding another veggie or fruit, a whole grain, a salad, a soup, or a bean dish to the meal. With more variety, you miss the giant piece of meat less. 

Same goes for eggs. We don't need four eggs and three pieces of two kinds of meat for breakfast. Share an omelette on Saturday morning with your person, then add an orange and some veggies and potatoes. Then eat oatmeal the rest of the week. I would venture a guess that eggs will go way up again if we see bird flu worsen. 

2. You don't need cheese on everything. There, I said it. Cheese is delicious, but we consume SO MUCH of it, and most of the time it's being added to an already nutritionally adequate meal. Use less or leave it off once in a while, and avoid the upcharge or grocery cost. Non-Western diets that are nutritionally complete often contain little or no cheese. 

3. Simply reduce your portion sizes across the board, so that you are eating a little less of everything. Slow down, taste your food. Pause when you start to feel full, and see if you want to keep eating. Changing portion sizes is something we should do gradually over time to avoid feeling unsatisfied and going back to portions that are too big for us. 

It's almost cliche now, but if you're going out, share an entree or box up half for another meal. Restaurant portions are totally insane most of the time. Another way to spend less and eat better is to choose a soup and salad option, or get an appetizer and side salad (I've had mixed results with this. Sometimes it's just as much as a main dish! But sometimes it's a steal). Choose a small burger or chicken sandwich at fast food places, and take it with you so you can drink your own beverage. Or get a kids meal if you can get away with it! Most of us have to resort to eating out more than we'd like, so it's worth thinking about ways to save on this stuff too. 

4. Snack smarter. Have you bought a bag of chips recently? A 12 pack of soda? Sweets? It's all crazy expensive when you compare it to homemade snacks or fruit and veggies. AND they are setting you up to eat a huge amount in one sitting with the way they formulate these things. Some ideas: popcorn kernels popped in the microwave with a little butter or olive oil and salt, carrot sticks, a handful of peanuts, celery, a PB&J on wheat, homemade cookies or banana bread, a piece of fruit, a piece of dark chocolate (check out Aldi, their sea salt variety is my favorite!) or some sunflower seeds. Drink water, coffee, or tea. And yep - those are all way cheaper to make (or filter water yourself if you have the option) than to buy at the coffee shop. Especially if you skip the limited edition seasonal sweetened flavored creamer. A splash of milk costs next to nothing.

5. Recognize that a small portion of homemade food is usually more satisfying than a big portion of processed food. Our taste buds have been hacked by food scientists who work for food conglomerates, literally with the intention to make us buy more of their ultra processed, ""value added"" junk. I know the we are all doing a lot with only a little time and money, so this isn't meant to guilt anyone! It's just something to be mindful of. In my house, we spend less when we skip the processed stuff, mostly because we're eating far, far less food overall. Make processed foods you really love an occasional treat, and do more homemade.

6. Maybe this should've been higher up, but look into the foods that other cultures eat. Nothing wrong with applying non-Western strategies to Western ingredients, but it can also be helpful and delicious to learn what other cultures might eat in a day. For fun, try googling, ""typical Vietnamese breakfast"" - or, ""Persian rice dishes."" 

And often, when we have access to a cheap ingredient, we'll figure out what cuisines it's used in and look for recipes that way. Napa cabbage on sale? Time to make kimchi! Zucchini is in season? Ratatouille it is! Traditional cuisines use everything either in season or preserved, so they will naturally align with better value.

It can be an adventurous and fun way to stretch your food buck. 

7. Grow a little food at home. You could even start by sprouting soybeans, or regrowing a few green onions in a pot on your windowsill. There are lots of cheap ways to get started doing more, but they may not be as relevant to this sub. Growing a few herbs can save you a bunch of money if you normally buy them. :)

8. Cook a few inexpensive side dishes that can be served all week long. Try grains, beans, veggies, side casseroles, sturdy salads, and breads. Less time and waste is less cost!

9. Speaking of bread - focus on the staples! Most cultures have inexpensive staple foods as the center of every meal. From bread to rice, to potatoes and corn, and one of my favorites, cassava - it's different all over the world. But often the same items are available here for not much money.

I know none of this is revolutionary, and it can definitely be seen as undervaluing people's time when they have to spend more of it preparing food. I wish that weren't the case, but I for sure spend more time cooking than if I were eating a piece of meat, a single veggie, and a packet of ultra processed instant side dish, or eating out, every night. 

But it's just another way to think about reducing our food cost. I find it helpful when I start falling into expensive patterns. When I see statistics about how other countries with more traditional diets eat, it's easy to see why the Western diet is so costly. Every little bit counts!  ",5,1733428120.0,budgetfood,1,0.61,False

1h7hqgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyoming/comments/1h7hqgy/i_asked_chat_gpt_to_roast_the_major_townscities/,I asked Chat GPT to roast the major towns/cities in Wyoming ,"

1. **Cheyenne** ‚Äì The state capital, where even the tumbleweeds seem to get bored and blow away. It‚Äôs got a ‚Äúbig city‚Äù feel, but only if your idea of a big city is 65,000 people and a couple of fast-food chains. Want to see excitement? Wait for the next rodeo. That‚Äôs the pinnacle of adventure here!

2. **Casper** ‚Äì The city that probably asks ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the opposite of a destination?‚Äù because that‚Äôs exactly what it feels like. You might think you‚Äôre heading somewhere, but then you‚Äôre in Casper‚Ä¶ forever. If you're into oil rigs, this is your paradise. If not, well, there‚Äôs plenty of wide, empty space to contemplate life decisions.

3. **Laramie** ‚Äì The place where the University of Wyoming is the only thing keeping people from thinking the whole town is a ghost town. You could wander the streets and wonder if anyone actually lives here or if they‚Äôre just walking to their next class. The nightlife here is ‚Äúlively‚Äù‚Äîif by ‚Äúlively,‚Äù you mean a single bar hosting a karaoke night.

4. **Gillette** ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Energy Capital of the Nation,‚Äù a city where the only thing more abundant than coal is the number of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Open!‚Äù signs hanging around. Every corner features a new industrial complex, and if you want fine dining, just head to the local fast food joint with a side of dust. 

5. **Jackson** ‚Äì Ah yes, the place where billionaires come to ""rough it"" in style. Jackson is less about the town and more about making sure your Patagonia jacket is perfectly visible. Don‚Äôt worry about the wildlife‚Äîyou‚Äôll never see a moose because your overpriced hotel is blocking the view. The only thing more rare than seeing a bear is a reasonable hotel price.

6. **Rock Springs** ‚Äì This place is like the halfway point where no one actually wants to stop, but you have to. It‚Äôs as if it was built as an afterthought. If you‚Äôve driven through here, you‚Äôll know it as a ""blink and you miss it"" kind of town. Don‚Äôt blink too fast‚Äîyou might accidentally find yourself in Green River, which‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs another story.

7. **Sheridan** ‚Äì You‚Äôd think this place was stuck in the Wild West forever, and that‚Äôs exactly how they want it. The only ‚Äúmodern‚Äù thing here is the Wi-Fi at the local coffee shop, which is probably slower than your dial-up internet at home. If you‚Äôre looking for history, you‚Äôll find it. If you‚Äôre looking for modern culture... better look somewhere else.

8. **Torrington** ‚Äì So remote that the cows know more people than the people do. The excitement here is minimal, but hey, it‚Äôs great for stargazing, because there‚Äôs literally nothing else to look at.

9. **Green River** ‚Äì Green River, Wyoming: where you can experience the beauty of a river that‚Äôs barely green and a city that feels like an afterthought on the way to somewhere else. If you‚Äôre into abandoned train cars and roadside diners, you‚Äôve found the promised land.

10. **Evanston** ‚Äì Located on the edge of Wyoming, Evanston is the town that looks at you like it knows you‚Äôre just passing through. Don‚Äôt try to linger too long‚Äînothing here stays open past 8 p.m., and even the quiet is quieter than usual.

As a Sheridan resident, I couldn't agree more. And I do like it that way",12,1733427502.0,wyoming,9,0.73,False

-cutting out inflammatory food such as aged cheese (all cheeses nearly)

‚ÄúSpeak for yourself.‚Äù Harley growls  
  
Matilda looks to Harley, ‚ÄúWe can help you a bit.‚Äù  
  
The scientist replies, ""Trust me. The wait will be worth it.‚Äù And walks out‚Ä¶  
  
Ten minutes pass, and the four walk to the empty hall to the cafeteria‚Ä¶ no one in there, but all the food was left at the station lines for the taking.. enough food for a small army.  
  
‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Jackson and Tyko say together in agreeance! ‚ÄúI can wait for a bit‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in starvation mode.‚Äù  
  
The scientist looks to his watch, ‚ÄúCan you all wait‚Ä¶ ten minutes?‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just about to wrap up for a session, and I can have the spot closed off. You can eat as much as you want in privacy then.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú‚Ä¶Right‚Ä¶. So food then for now‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tyko says. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs find some food then‚Ä¶‚Äù Jackson replies. ‚ÄúYou wanna go get it for us, ooor?‚Äù He asks the scientist.  
  
The Scientist looks to them, ""Exactly how would you explain to them that we are doing this to people in order to survive what's down there? They'd only hear half and freak out. So we've kept this mostly quiet and are going to break it to them slowly.""  
  
Matilda looks nervously, ""What about her families? My brother... Cleatus?...""  
  
The scientist thinks on this, ""Just keep to engaging over comms rather than directly being with them."" He says, ""When the time comes and we've had some success, we can break the news to them.""  
  
Jackson goes wide-eyed! ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even KNOW yet?!?!‚Äù He says a little loudly, but trying to stop from yelling.  
  
The Scientist scratches the back of his head, ""You might want to wait till the mess hall empties. This is not something explained to the rest of the staff. It's mainly a project approved by the higher ups. People may freak out.""  
  
Jackson just looks over, ‚ÄúSo I can go meet the others‚Ä¶ like this? With a toga?‚Äù He points to the greecian wear on him.  
  
Scientist nods, ‚ÄúAnd thanks for taking it. I‚Äôm certain all your cloths would become a biohazard if you didn‚Äôt..‚Äù  
  
Harley stood up again after getting the sheets wrapped around her chest and waist. ‚ÄúCan we go eat or something now?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, yes yes, that word be for the best.‚Äù The scientist said, ‚ÄúGive yourselves time to adjust to your new forms.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Matilda speaks up, what do I wear?‚Ä¶ my body just rips everything.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI mean, my clothing ain‚Äôt torn‚Ä¶. But thank you.‚Äù Tyko thanks generously‚Ä¶  
  
Jackson looks down, without saying a word.  
  
Harley rolls her eyes and takes it, ‚ÄúEither of you look my way, I‚Äôll claw you to pieces..‚Äù She starts wrapping the sheets around herself.  
  
The scientist turns to Tyko, ‚ÄúWell we do have one thing that may fit, the wet suit of a scuba set. It should hold up despite your‚Ä¶ toxic muca's..‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAh. So there‚Äôs something fitting for me‚Ä¶?‚Äù Tyko asks.  
  
Jackson‚Äôs moans‚Ä¶! ‚ÄúAw maaaan! Seriously! I gotta dress like a Greek!?‚Äù  
  
The door opens and the scientist walks in, ‚ÄúOkay, we don‚Äôt have anything at the moment for Harley or Jackson, but we got some bedsheets you can wrap in until we can make real stuff.‚Äù He hands two sheets to Jack the goes to Harley.. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still figuring out something for Matilda.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah! I could eat an entire cow! ‚Ä¶.And a lot of rice for some reason‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyko says.  
  
Jackson then walks around, but closer to the door, with no intention of leaving‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù Matilda said, still looking to her claws.  
  
Harley noticed how quiet everyone was for a while, so she spoke up. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ anyone else want to eat after our clothes show up?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶. I kinda feel weird with my poison‚Ä¶. Just uh‚Ä¶. Try not to touch me or stick your hands in your mouth when you touch me‚Ä¶.‚Äù  
  
Jackson replies, ‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUgh, that was painful‚Ä¶‚Äù Harley said, ‚ÄúI hope I never have to do that again..‚Äù  
  
Matilda nodded, ‚ÄúAnd now‚Ä¶‚Äù She looked to her hands, ‚ÄúThis is what we are?..‚Äù  
  
Tyko struggled to walk around lightly, trying to adjust his legs, but never leaving the room‚Ä¶  
  
Jackson turned to the wall and just leaned on the cot‚Ä¶ not really doing too much as he rocks back and forth.  
  
Scientist still staring then snaps out of it, ‚ÄúR-right. Let me grab what I can find. Try not to move much.‚Äù And the man walks off.  
  
Not moving starts to seem like a good idea, Tyko‚Äôs feet are hard to walk with as they stick to the floor. And the other three are struggling to balance their new size and weight as well as their new feet.  
  
Harley already was holding and leaning on the cot with one hand as the other covered her chest  
  
Matilda more sat on her bed then bothered to stand up.  
  
‚ÄúUmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I need much clothing, obviously cover my less than pleasant spots, but yeah‚Ä¶ mine are just fine‚Ä¶.‚Äù  
  
Jackson checks himself out and covers himself. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I could some too‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Harley growls as she gets up, ""I feelll... Just... ow..."" She stands up and actually looks down on Jackson. ""Woah... You're a-"" A slight rip sound is heard and she covers her chest. ""Uuuummmmm."" Holds her clothes, ""Could I get a new outfit?""  
  
Matilda gets up whimpering, and covers herself as her clothes are barely hanging on. ""I'm so hungry... and tired...""  
  
The scientist looks to all of them with aw and excitement.  
  
‚ÄúI feel like‚Ä¶ that feeling Ma says you get when you take drugs‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tyko says, holding his head‚Ä¶‚ÄùBrain feels like‚Ä¶ butterflies‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Jackson feels EXCITED when he gets up! ‚ÄúI feel absolutely GREAT!!!‚Äù He says, his voice echoing into the next room! ‚ÄúI feel like I could run a ton of marathons!‚Äù  
  
Harley's clothes are barely holding on after she has grown and changed, the cot is not barely big enough for her. As she calms down, and the growing stops, then the straps on her snap off  
  
Matilda whimpers and pants as she lays on the bed. She turns, and the cut straps finally snap loose.  
  
The pain easing, but they are all hungry and exhausted...  
  
Scientist looks to them all... ""Are you okay? How are you feeling? if you need to rest, that's fine, I can still track your vitals.""  
  
Tyko began to calm as his transformation finished, remaining human, with frog like features‚Ä¶  
  
Jackson began to slow in growth just as the strap holding chest below the pectorals snapped off! His growth making him look like a champion weightlifter!  
  
Harley's bed was shaking as the straps were at her limit, her size was shockingly changing and her weight made every thrash shake the cot. The scientist ran over to hold it in place. As she trashed and squirmed, a tail started to form between Harley and the bed. one that was orange with black strips... a pattern that was noticed in the fur growing all over her body.  
  
Matilda screamed and tried to roll in her cot, ripping was heard as fabrics and the straps were starting to get cut. and from out under her, a tail covered in scales started to come out.  
  
Tyko felt his eyes relocating outward to the sides more‚Ä¶ his vision feeling weird, but not BAD. Next were his feet, which had the same treatment as his hands‚Ä¶  
  
Jackson‚Äôs belts strapping his body down all strained audibly as he began to grow in size lightly!  
  
Matilda whined and squirmed in her restraints the parts without scales started to grow a thin layer of fur. Her head deforming, growing longer and thinner as her ears stretched out.  
  
Harley's muscles grew larger too, her whole body was. along with blacked claws on her hands and feet. Yet still, no matter how much she thrashed and growled and cried out, she couldn't get free  
  
Jackson‚Äôs muscles ripple on his entire body, abs, calves, forearms, pecs, you name it; and his fingernails blacken and grow out as his voice deepens with discomfort‚Ä¶  
  
Tyko feels something slipping around on his skin‚Ä¶ there was thin layer for fluid on his body already secreted!!  
  
Matilda's hair starts to fall out rapidly, in it's place, skin starts to harden and com apart, only to reveal more skin like it, each piece looking more and more like scales rather than skin.  
  
Harley starts to groan, and then growl as her nose and mouth merge and reshape like a short muzzle, her ears shifting upwards on her head and her arms and legs growing more and more muscle.  
  
Tyko feels his ends of his fingers rounding out as his skin turns black with blue marking and splotches, his eyes looking more like ovals as yellow bleeds into the whites already there‚Ä¶.  
  
Matilda looks to her hands, her fingernails are slowly growing longer... and thicker.  
  
Harley groans as she struggles, her head deforming slowly as her mouth and nose jut out.  
  
Tyko looks at his hands‚Ä¶. ‚Äú‚Ä¶.Am I high cause of the poison froooooh‚Ä¶‚Äù He starts to space out as his hands slowly morph at a snail's pace‚Ä¶.  
  
Jackson himself feels hair sprouting everywhere, even in places he didn‚Äôt think was possible, at a snail's pace.  
  
The scientist straps down Jackson next, ""Tyko is correct, I've run simulations and look to make this pass as quickly as possible."" grabs a syringe, ""Just be ready.""  
  
One by one, he injects them right in the chest, right to the heart. It stings, but it's short, then they start to feel something else...  
  
Jackson sits down and then looks to the dock. ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt gonna actually hurt much, is it? Just kinda nervous if needles‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyko next overhears and chuckles a little‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOnly the initial stick of the needle‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Harley and Matilda get onto cots too. The scientist goes and starts to strap then down and looks to Jackson, ""Well, last one is for you.""  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they would risk ‚Äòactually killing us'. I sure wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Tyko sits on a cot, waiting for the doc and trying to ease Harley‚Äôs concerns, though he himself was concerned too‚Ä¶  
  
""Indeed,"" The scientist says, ""I don't know how you'll all react, and would rather not have you harming yourselves as a result.""  
  
Harley looks to this, ""Or will this harm us?""  
  
""Please, just have a seat on a cot, and we'll get this started."" the Scientist said, seeming to dodge the question.  
  
‚ÄúHeh‚Ä¶. You ain‚Äôt expecting us to go crazy, are you?‚Äù Tyko said jokingly. ‚ÄúWhy not? The straps wouldn‚Äôt be there otherwise. Or at least for precautionary measures.‚Äù  
  
The scientist was laying out some syringes on some beds that had many buckles and straps to them  
  
Shortly after, Tyko next heads back to the scientists quarters to figure out where to go next. Precisely for the dna mixture.  
  
Matilda giggles at that, ‚ÄúStrawberry shortcake is my favorite.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúPfff, everyone knows devil chocolate cake is the best.‚Äù Harley said.  
  
‚ÄúJust about! Just want a slice of cheesecake‚Ä¶. With some Hershey drizzle‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tyko says his eyes glazing over with delight!  
  
Harley nods, ‚ÄúAmen to that.‚Äù She Drinks cup of coffee. You guys almost finished?  
  
Tyko nods and then tries to smile. ‚ÄúI hope it changes too, as we can ship stuff back and forth‚Ä¶‚Äù He says. Jackson then stepping in again, Well, I just want humanity to grow. I want us to be stronger\~!‚Äù  
  
""Uhuh. What if life turned around since the started shipping chunks of the population off the planet?‚Äù Harley asks.  
  
""I wouldn't mind seeing if earth is different now."" Matilda says.  
  
Harley looks to her, ""It doesn't hurt to have hope,"" Finishes some chicken strips, ""But, here and now, we're going to make landfall on this planet and we're going to keep it this time.""  
  
‚ÄúAll I‚Äôve heard is from my parents, as of late‚Ä¶. If we‚Äôre on our own‚Ä¶.‚Äù He pauses, picking up a spoonful of Mac n‚Äô cheese. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I really shouldn‚Äôt be surprised‚Ä¶‚Äù He takes a bite of the food.  
  
Harley Looks to his puzzled, ""And your parents told you this yesterday?... We've been away from earth since I was six. Has anyone heard from earth in the last five years?""  
  
Matilda is still quiet but looks to her curious.  
  
""Anyone?"" Harley repeats.  
  
In truth, no one messages have come from earth in the past six years.  
  
‚Äú‚Ä¶My parents. A day ago. Said it was bad as smog made it was hard to see‚Ä¶ like Tokyo, but worse‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyko then frowns. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to be mean‚Ä¶ I thought she just meant she would be on earth, with the life being choked out you‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Matilda quietly looks away after that.  
  
""Way to play it nice."" Harley said, ""When was the last time you heard about earth?""  
  
‚ÄúIf you think smog and coughing your lungs out is life, then yeah, people still live there‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tyko says coldly‚Ä¶  
  
Harley doesn't look his way, she just keeps eating the food off her tray. ""Yep...""  
  
Matilda, ""Was earth harmed that badly? I heard plenty of people still live there.""  
  
Tyko leans in cautiously. ‚Äú‚Ä¶BEFORE or AFTER the ravaging of humanity‚Ä¶?‚Äù  
  
Matilda looks down ‚Äúumm‚Ä¶ y-yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Harley leans back in her seat, ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm just sick of living in a metal box. I was told what earth was and a planet was like living on, and I‚Äôd rather live like that.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI wanna help humanity out. We botched it on earth and didn‚Äôt regulate metal vs plant life‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs so polluted, now it‚Äôs a runaway freight train‚Ä¶ I wanna give humanity another chance‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tyko says straightaway.  
  
Harley looks to them as she eats ‚Äúso‚Ä¶ why are you all going down there?..‚Äù  
  
Matilda looks surprised, ‚ÄúMe? I‚Äôm.. um‚Ä¶..‚Äù  
  
Tyko starts to pray a moment‚Ä¶ begging for the stomach to have all of this‚Ä¶ Them starts eating, while Jackson is just going into town, starting with a big sautee‚Äôd steak!  
  
Matilda thinks on this‚Ä¶  
  
Harley starts walking, ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go eat.‚Äù  
  
At the mess hall, they find a table big enough for them, and each has a tray with food piled high on it..  
  
Harley eats her food mainly with her hands.  
  
Matilda looks to the others and cuts her food before eating‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶.. pray I get the stomach for this‚Ä¶. Mmmph‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyko seems uncomfortable‚Ä¶. Jackson seems slighted, but grins, ‚ÄúHeh, guess I‚Äôll pig out a little‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
Scientist takes a breath, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put it this way‚Ä¶ overeating may be a good thing, because the transformation and growth will rapidly burn calories. You may starve to death if you don‚Äôt eat enough..‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúReally? How much, calorie wise?‚Äù Tyko asks. ‚ÄúWe ain‚Äôt talkin‚Äô like a mukbang, are we?‚Äù Jackson asks.  
  
""Their... cute?"" Matilda blushes a bit... ""Okay...""  
  
""It looks like we have our heading, I'm going to get these prepared. for then, all of you have a big meal. Because the transformation is gonna require extra mass.""  
  
Harley Smirks, ""I get to pig out before training, I already like this."" She walks for the mess hall.  
  
‚ÄúA pangolin, from what little I‚Äôve seen, are pretty cute\~‚Ä¶ and also not a bad idea for Matilda.‚Äù ‚ÄúEh. I suppose that‚Äôd be good. We could use a wall when we get to a bind‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tyko and Jackson say, backing up the scientist.  
  
""I... I like the idea of being safe, but... could I be a turtle?..."" Matilda looks to the scientist.  
  
""Well."" The scientist says, ""That may be hard because we want predators... but... Maybe we could go with something like a pangolin they do have the defense to survive... or maybe a porcupine... sorry, we just have fewer options when it comes to choosing prey...""  
  
‚ÄúHey. I‚Äôm being a poison dart frog, but you don‚Äôt have to pick it, Matilda.‚Äù Tyko states plainly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just helping out here.‚Äù  
  
Matilda looks to him, somewhat disgusted, ""A bug?...""  
  
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ you seem to be careful/fearful about everything‚Ä¶. Which can be a good thing ‚Äòto a degree‚Äô.‚Äù Tyko stress the last bit to a more heavy degree‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúMaybe pick a dung beetle or stag beetle for defense?‚Äù  
  
Little Matilda looks to him curious. ""What would you suggest?""  
  
‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not my place, but might I make a suggestion Matilda??‚Äù Tyko asks.  
  
Harley shrugs, ""Fourth member either way, what's your name?""  
  
""I... I'm Matilda."" She said, ""So... what is the plan for going down there?...""  
  
""Gene splicing."" Harley said, plain and simple.  
  
""We just need to figure out what will help you best for down there."" The scientist said, ""We have enough muscle for down there, so we might want to try it out with something more mobile.""  
  
""Umm..."" Matilda looks to all the options intimidated, ""What should I be mixed with?...""  
  
‚ÄúCleatus? He‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs easily usually more brave than others‚Ä¶. Why‚Äôd he chicken out?‚Äù Tybo asks. ‚ÄúMaybe he saw something he ain‚Äôt ever seen before\~‚Ä¶‚Äù Jackson says, putting his hands behind his head.  
  
The lady walks in more, ""I.. I was sent by Cleatus... he said he changed his mind..."" She says timidly, ""Could... could I take his place?""  
  
‚ÄúUuuuh‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù Tyko asks suggestively. ‚ÄúYeah. Where did you come from‚Ä¶?‚ÄùJackson asks as well.  
  
""Another Muscular one."" The scientist chuckles, ""Sounds good. We just need one more...""  
  
They hear a clack sound, and they turn to see a mop had fallen over, because a small woman had been eavesdropping on the conversation.  
  
‚ÄúHow aboooout‚Ä¶. A lion? I like strength!‚Äù He says plainly! ‚ÄúMajestic like the Savanah itself\~!‚Äù  
  
Scientist sighs, ""Just bare in mind what you are going to be using these 'superpowers' for."" He looks over computer screens, ""So what would you prefer to have?""  
  
‚ÄúJackson. And I can‚Äôt wait to get a pick on that dna stuff! Kinda like having super powers!‚Äù ‚ÄúReally? Super powers are the first thing on your mind? Tyko asks politely, but concernedly.  
  
Scientist smirks to this guy, ""Fashionably late, I see."" he says, ""So who might you be?""  
  
‚ÄúWell now. Should that be my queue?‚Äù A red haired man steps in, in his mid 30‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind joining in\~! I wanna kick some butt!‚Äù  
  
The scientist thinks on this, ""Well... This could be to see if this gene enhancing could fix that issue with his legs"" He sighs, ""Alas, I'd rather not risk that.""  
  
Harley just shrugs, ""So we send someone else down with us.""  
  
‚ÄúHe can walk, but he is much ‚Äòmuch‚Äô slower and needs the cane. Mom is a good cook, so she could stay up here and make meals. But has told me she is not against making my meals down there for the team. Though obviously I said I‚Äôm not wanting her to come down there.‚Äù Tyko says adding onto the information there.  
  
""The case as so for your mother, but with her expecting it'd be best if she stayed up here. Your father on the other hand..."" The scienist checks some papers... ""he's crippled right? unable to walk?""  
  
‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶ I heard my ma and pa would be on a similar mission? Or am I imagining things?‚Äù Tyko asks genuinely.  
  
""Poison defense and high mobility, very well."" The scientist says and starts to type with the machines.  
  
""I'll take up the tiger. Be some real muscle."" Harley states.  
  
""Another fine choice,"" The scientist states, ""you'd be strong and mobile.""  
  
Harley looks around, so will it just be us two going down, or will there be more?  
  
Scientist, ""Well four people was the initial plan, but half the group appears to be late.""  
  
‚ÄúPoison dart frogs‚Ä¶. I DO love their color‚Ä¶.. Alright. Take a look into that.‚Äù Tyko states excitedly.  
  
The scientist things on this, ""Well if you want something venomous... I could look into poison Dart frogs. it wouldn't take me long."" he looks to Tyko, ""But the closest we got on hand are snakes.""  
  
‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶ I could maybe use the poison that a toad had for weapons and venoms?‚Äù Tyko suggests.  
  
Harley looks to Tyko. ""Why a toad? They're not really a predator. We're preparing to fight on a hostile planet""  
  
‚ÄúHeh. Sorry. Had to try‚Ä¶. Always was a nut for dinosaurs.‚Äù He laughs plenty, and then composes himself. ‚ÄúA Toad.‚Äù  
  
The scientist pauses, then he chuckles and looks to Tyko. ""I'm sorry, but we don't have genes for an animal that went extinct..""  
  
‚Äú‚Ä¶Hmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyko feels concerned the lack of response, like it wasn‚Äôt fully under control‚Ä¶.. but he thinks about his choice‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúI hope this isn‚Äôt a stretch‚Ä¶? Maybe an Achelosaurus?‚Äù He asks, obviously a sort of dinosaurs name‚Ä¶  
  
The scientist is quiet about that for a moment, ""I'm... working on it..."" He says, ""For now, just keep in mind we cannot keep on this starship forever. we need somewhere to colonize and live.""  
  
""And we don't just ask earth for help?"" Harley asks,  
  
The scientist doesn't answer, he just keeps looking over the research...  
  
Harley sighs and looks to Tyko, ""So... what do you plan to take for genes? What animals?""  
  
""Keep it to just one for now, please, we're gonna start small."" The scientist adds.  
  
‚ÄúSo is this‚Ä¶ temporary? Or a new way of life???‚Äù Tyko asks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not concerned about living life as an animal, but I wanna if this a ‚Äònew change‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
""Indeed,"" The scientist said, ""Our simulations and live tests on rats have shown what limits can be taken to ensure you remain as is while gaining these benefits."" He pulls a switch and the glass tubes fill with fluids, ""So long as the DNA remains more human than anything else you'll be fine.""  
  
Harley looks to this funny ""So... you're adding animal genes to us?"" She crosses arms, ""What kind of genes are we talking here?""  
  
The scientist doesn't look their way, he's busy inspecting the fluids, ""Mostly predators. Bear or tiger, if you want strength. Cheetah or wolf, for mobility. Badger or fish if you want resilience. Either way, it should make you able to fight most of the dangers that's down there.""  
  
‚ÄúMessing with the genetic line? That can‚Äôt be too good‚Ä¶‚Äù Tyko says a little nervously‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou sure you know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù  
  
The Scientist looks to him, ""Well there will be that, but it will happen after some tests are run. The others should be in here shortly.""  
  
""Are you talking about me?"" A woman's voice is heard, and what walks in is a short and thin woman with red hair and pale skin. ""I heard you were planning to send people down, and I was next in line. How are you gonna make sure we don't die?""  
  
The scientist looks to her, ""Gene enhancements.""  
  
""Oh? I'm going to go through some training? Well, ok...?"" He says, his mother not able to risk REAL training or too much strain, but offered to cook anything for others. His dad offering to share info he finds out about on the ground level...  
  
The Scientist looks to him, ""We're going to try and improve your natural abilities so you can better withstand what is down there. We'll be doing it enough to help you based on what you are best capable."" He looks over the charts, ""You seem to be naturally real flexible. Pair that with some strength and you could help clear away things we could start building stuff down there. as well as kill off what beasts are down there.""  
  
""Geeze..."" He looked down, then back up at the bit about 'something new'. ""OK? What kind of new thing?"" Tyko then listened in curiosity, fully expecting a response.  
  
the scientist looks to him, face grim and sad, ""I've seen the footage, whatever got them was... brutal..."" He sighs and looks back to his tech pad, ""This is why we are having to try something new and hope for the best.""  
  
Tyko, a male of white descent, had looked around, the 17 years old human knowing fully well that the others were dead, or missing; best case scenario... Looking next to a scientist, he asks the first question on his mind. ""You don't think they're... dead. right?""  
  
It is 2098, Humanity as started to explore the stars and seek other planets to live on.

He rejected me.","A few days ago, I saw a post about Gen Z men being single and lonely. I commented on my main that my best friend was a really good guy yet a single virgin ‚Äî and the internet gave me the courage to ask him out. ""Take initiative"" they said.

For context, we're college friends and he's in my same classes. We have coffee sometimes and buddies in common.

I asked him out today and he said NO because I am ""not his type"". 

His type being someone along the lines of Pokimane. I am 5'9 and around 160lbs (taller and heavier than him). I can't hold a candle to a pretty streamer. 

Mind you, he's been posting for weeks about being ""depressed"" that he has no one for ""cuffing season"". 

Can't deny I fucking cried. I have found him cute for months yet he thinks he's ugly and doesn't take me seriously. 

It's NOT my first time being rejected but I truly did everything the ""lonely men"" said they dreamed of; bought him lunch, made it private, didn't emasculate him. What now? Do I turn into a bitter incel, like dudes do when rejected? You can't blame ""feminism"" on this one.

His friends apparently already know because he told them (those guys are also all single...) and they basically joked around that none of them would reject the gooner life for someone like me. What happened to hating OF? 

You aren't desperate for a GF. You are desperate for a hot girl to bang.

For the last two weeks I've been experiencing some narly nasal congestion. My nose is constantly stuffed up and dry/bloody no matter what I do. I thought I was sick with a cold but I'm not and it hasn't gone away. I've never had anything this bad before. I'm constantly running our humidifier and I have vix up my nose so I can breathe lol. Everything feels dry like my mouth, nose and throat. I thought maybe it was the weather as well but my husband doesn't feel this way, just me. 

I've been a coffee drinker my whole life, never had a problem with coffee and I drink multiple cups a day (2). So yesterday I had my usual cup and after I was done I sat on the couch and just puked ALL OVER our living room...I haven't done that since I was a little girl. For the last two weeks every time I drink coffee I feel like I'm about to puke. I have this queasy feeling all day now since the moment I wake up and coffee makes it worse and now I can't even have my favorite drink anymore without getting sick ü•π 

My last symptom is I'm so tired and fatigued I've been sleeping on and off all day which is unusual for me because I hate taking naps and I hate feeling tired. Yesterday after I puked I litterally just laid in bed all day long and felt weak. I just kept thinking I'm coming down with something but I'm not sick with anything. I don't have covid or the flu or a cold.

 My husband and I were intimate multiple times just before I ovulated and during ovulation. I did start my period this month, but it was pink and brown spotting for a few days and then it got heavier for like two days then got light again and stopped. It wasn't as bad as my normal periods, so I'm not sure because I read you can't have a period and be pregnant. Like my cramps weren't as bad as I usually get them, they were pretty light compared to what I usually go through.

>My best friend and I have this lovely gift tradition where we give each other a book and an ornament. Sometime around Thanksgiving, we each send the other a list of 3-4 books that we'd really like and we choose from that list so we know it's something we each want to read. And, then, an ornament. We meet for a nice lunch one day around Christmas, exchange gifts, spend time together, and it's wonderful, stress-free, and budget-friendly. Win-win-win.

>I'd love a similar (yet slightly different) tradition to do with other friends but I'm at a loss as to what it could be. Any ideas? I'd really love to simplify and stream-line gift-giving among friends.

>I'm 48yo female if that helps with ideas. Thanks in advance!

1h7hhyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/1h7hhyj/having_problems_with_castmate/,Having problems with castmate.,"I'm currently in rehearsals for a small community theatre show in which I am playing the lead. It's my first time doing it, and so far the rehearsals have been going well. The set isn't completely finished yet, so we have been having a few issues with positioning/blocking/visibility and are trying to iron these out. The director has told me and the others to speak up if we think something looks wrong or if someone is blocking the audience's view of another actor, etc. I have taken any advice or direction I've been given and haven't felt criticised or insulted by it, and I didn't think any of the others were either.

 However, during our rehearsal on Monday I noticed this particular castmate stood in front of me instead of beside me, and blocked my view of an object that I am supposed to look at while I speak (my character is not able to move from my original position). In previous rehearsals she stood in the correct place. After we had finished the scene, when the director asked if we had any issues, I said that I couldn't see the object and I thought it would be better if she stood beside me instead, like last week. She then got quite angry with me, denied that she had stood beside me before, and told the director that he should cut out the part where I look at the object. I tried to defuse it by saying I wasn't trying to be difficult and she basically berated me for a couple of minutes while everyone went silent. It was very awkward and embarrassing, and since then she has given me the silent treatment, being bright and friendly with the others and blanking me, making coffee and bringing biscuits and cakes in for everyone except me, etc. She blocked the audience's view of me today and when I pointed it out she said ""the audience don't need to see YOU"", even though the script calls for me to make a specific facial expression that the audience do need to see.

 I have been trying to be civil and polite, but when we are waiting to go on she keeps staring at me and scowling. I was really enjoying the experience but now I feel very self conscious and uncomfortable having to act with someone who I feel is trying to undermine me. She is an older woman who has been part of the theatre group for many years and has a very close relationship with the others. I think they were all shocked by how she reacted on Monday, but I think if I bring it up with her or anyone else they will take her side and I might end up losing my part. Should I speak to her about it privately, speak to the director about it, or should I wait a few more days and see how it develops? Any advice is welcome.",3,1733426913.0,Theatre,5,0.8,False
1h7hhfj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7hhfj,"COMT, MTHFR, CBS - unsure what to take (methylated or not), what to avoid, and best order of operations. ","Sorry in advance for the long post. I recently got my methylation panels back and have some questions. I used ChatGPT to ""discuss"" each of these individually and also in aggregate with other health history and considerations which was really useful. My main goal is to heal my gut because with 2 years of issues, it may be a cause of deficiencies in the labs, and other symptoms. To do this, I think I need to better understand the results and implicates of these panels. Plus, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs merits on their own to supplement for optimal health. 

If you're ambitious, there is some more context and questions at the end. Thanks for any insight!

Labs 
I've just done (awaiting results) labs for homocystein, B vitamins (prob just folate, 6 and 12), D3, Iron. What else is recommended? On a previous post someone suggested Thyroid. In September my TSH was in the normal range so they didn‚Äôt test anything further (1.14, ref: 0.47-4.68 uIU/ML)

Supplements & Food
Should I take methylated or non for the Bs? Will this depend on the lab results? What else do you recommend? 
How much attention to sulfur and/or ammonia and/or histamine do I need to give (in diet, sups, labs?) especially given symptoms outlined below. Unsure how significant these are. 

And now the medical history part.¬†I am experiencing a LOT of symptoms. Some might be perimenopause, some might be from ~2 years of GI issues resulting in malabsorption (the root cause of which is still under investigation, with SIBO test in the mail and endo/colonoscopy in a few weeks.) With the recent results on genetics, I wonder if MCAS and/or histamine might be at play.¬†I really don't know where to start.¬†I'm overwhelmed by all the possible paths making me feel unwell. I'm 39f, active, omnivore with a heavy emphasis on plants. The idea of avoiding cruciferous vegetables, fermented food, nuts, legumes, so many fruits and other vegetables makes me sad.
Symptoms/conditions - first long standing then newer since perimenopause
* asthma
* environmental allergies causing hay fever symptoms
* allergies to fragrance/dyes causing contact dermatitis
* oral allergy syndrome (melons, avocado, carrots etc usually if underripe causing throat and mouth itchiness)
* on/off GI symptoms dominated by excessive, foul gas. Negative for celiac, negative for SIBO several years ago. Went away on its own.
* occasional idiopathic hives/rash on upper body (torso, limbs, face). Sometimes itchy, sometimes not.
* Raynauds (plus lots of immediate family history of other autoimmune disease like RA and T1 Diabetes)
Newer (last few years, likely aligns to earliest perimenopausal changes in hormones)
* non-allergic rhinitis (exercise induced. I‚Äôm confident this is non-allergic because the setting doesn‚Äôt matter. Indoor, outdoor, pool. It happens when I do long, hard enduro workouts. Sneeze and seriously faucet-like nose for days, H2 antihistamines can help prevent, but neither H1 nor H2 touch it once activated).
* GI foul gas, daily pudding-like diarrhea for about 2 years
* cognitive impairments (recently diagnosed with ADHD due to family history but suspect there could be other mechanisms for the memory, brain fog and focus issues)
* POTS, intense light headedness, dizziness, darkening vision when changing physical position from sitting/laying/squatting to standing
* Tinnitus (most of adult life but getting worse)
* alcohol intolerance (flushing, tight chest, elevated heart rate, rash up neck/torso). I don‚Äôt drink anymore (~6mo of way cutting back, and 40 days completely off) but I went through an era of heavier drinking before that.
* intensely itchy skin on chest, neck, face. Sometimes with rash, sometimes not. Itching isn‚Äôt due to dryness. I‚Äôm moisturized.
* GERD, though much improved since switching from coffee to green tea.
* Thinning hair
I did CBC and Comprehensive metabolic panel in September with some odd results. Will re-test in a month.

He's 14 weeks old and things have gotten so much better since we magically exited the Fourth Trimester but something about last night's potential start of the 4 month sleep regression and this mornings screamfest during tummy time just broke me. I love my son, and overall I'm grateful to have him in my life, but man I did not know that the shrapnel from the Baby Bomb could reach so far and so deep. While I was feeding him during his two-part bottle this morning (he now prefers to split all of his meals, which occur every 3 hours, into 2-3oz parts where the first half is done in about 15 minutes and then the second half, offered 30-40 minutes later after multiple rounds of spit-up, is a game of two sucks then rip off the nipple, gasp and chomp at bottle, two sips then rip off...) I just started bawling thinking about how much my life has changed and how I feel bad that this little guy chose me as his mom. I'm just not nearly as empathatic/sweet/kind/motherly as I thought I was going to be, or as other moms seem to be toward their kids. The minute he cries over something trivial (this morning we did an assisted roll over that sent him spiraling, and before that I had to use the snot sucker on his nose because he's recovering from a cold) it just pisses me off and I feel this revulsion to comforting him and its like this rage tingles in my wrists and my neck and I just want to scream right back at him when I know what I should be doing is comforting him, speaking kind words, patting his back yaddayaddayadda ... so I just have to walk away. 

And then I feel like a royal shitbag for ""abandoning"" my child which makes me even more upset and then all I can do during the 5 minute break I just bought myself is think about all the things I miss about my old life and all the things that just honestly SUCK about this new one. I miss being able to go hiking, to dinner, to the movies, fuck I miss going ANYWHERE other than the grocery store for 30 minutes during a naptime that won't happen; I miss wanting to have sex, I miss my friends, I miss being able to wear black (can't because of constant spit-up), I miss being able to make a decent dinner, I miss snowboarding, I miss reading a book, I miss sleeping in - PAST SIX a.m. - I miss making overnight plans, I miss watching a full episode that doesn't cut into my already limited sleep. Then there's the current joys of motherhood like my hair falling out, 15 pounds that I just can't seem to lose (I wonder why - perhaps its the negative 2 hours a day that I have to myself to exercise or the hormone driven need to consume calories for breastfeeding), half of my wardrobe ruined due to baby bodily fluids, my marriage has taken a nosedive, my house is a mess, my work brain has turned to complete mush, my sheets are soaked in breastmilk, our savings account is dwindling, and I JUST WANT TO ENJOY A FULL CUP OF COFFEE WHILE ITS STILL HOT. So yeah I set him down during both bursts of crying so that I could go cry myself.

I thought a rant would make me feel better because I haven't journaled about this new motherhood journey at all but now I just feel like an ungrateful turd because I know it could be worse. My baby could be seriously sick, or we could be hella poor, or I could have lost my job, or my husband could be a dickhead, or we could (jesus how do people do this) have ANOTHER kid to manage, but we don't and all in all I know I have it pretty good...and this is still hard.

the whole thing begins with my friends/classmates or whatever constantly changing and postponing exams on exam day or right in the night before the exam which leads to a situation where i spent hours getting preparing just for it then to be canceled it alos leads to them getting crammed and it is very normal to start having days with 2+ exams in all in one day.
how and why you may ask? they are simply incompetent and don't wanna study and many other factors that play into this that they use as excuses to not take the exams on the day they are supposed to be taken, i guess you can see how that can get frustrating right? and the fucking stupid professer/drs allow it.

for an example they would just cancel an exam cause they wanna make sure the next week will have an exam and other one will scheduled on that same day/week (ironic how it backfires towards the end and they know the drill too well).

anyways my current situation happend 2 days ago where surprise thier incompetence and laziness led to having 3 exams all crammed into one day, you can imagine how exhausting it is to prepare to all of that right? so i chose to only prepare for 2 of them since i already had good marks on that other one. so the big exams day comes and we take the one i didnt study for, i sucked but its fine thats the plan anyways, next thing i know everyone were protesting to cancel the other 2 since it is unfair to take 3 exams on one day? (like bruh i don't to explain the level of responsibility and accountability these people aren't taking).
so under all of this pressure the administration agreed to that under the condition the other 2 exams are going to take place tomorrow. so i fucking snapped and left the place before i scum to my rage and frustration for the exam i just wasted.

outside i yelled and verbally fought with them while they kept mocking me and telling me how stupid i was to not just cheat the exams we do on computers instead of wasting my time studying for them, then i just left after some very heated arguments with everybody. but the cheating part was stuck in my head like a glue.

so the next morning i was having my coffee in the class when i casually mentioned to some of my closer friends that i snitched to the administration about thier methods and will to cheat (whichs using some usb sticks with all the algorithms and any shi they might need to pass, too cheap and stupid to work ik but it does lmao). everybody who heard me went silent cause thier usb drives are of no use if there will be some ""strict measures"" for this exam. they kinda got mad and all of em were yelling and i could just hear the cussing and saying any vile shi about me, anything u can imagine. all of em. i instantly became the most hated and got casted out as the traitor.

the exam went normally and nothing was out of the ordinary. tho everybody thought there was really some ""stricter"" measures than usual but it was all in thier heads because they didn't have the courage to pull out thier scummy tactics this time.

the thing is? they never realized i didn't tell anybody about anything its all their heads fuming with paranoia and hatred towards me cause i did it to lick the adminstration's boots or toseem like the ""good child / pet"" instructors.

they really don't know how stupid they are and its funny.

the cherry on top was that like 80% of them failed both exams that day and all they can do is blame me for it while not being able to do shi about themselves.
non of em talked to me since and all i can feel or say about it : fuck em.

sweet revenge if you ask me and i don't feel bad about it at all!

I'm excited to announce that I've released a free to use [position sizing calculator ](https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/)to assist with risk management and position sizing based on several criteria:

1. **Percentage of Total Account** (for example, 1% of $10,000 would set your maximum risk to $100, thus calculating how many shares you can purchase, based on your entry and stop, with a max risk tolerance of $100) [https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/index.html](https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/index.html)
2. **Dollar Amount** (in other words, telling the calculator ""I only want to risk $500 dollars on this trade"") - [https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/dollarcalculator.html](https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/dollarcalculator.html)
3. **Position Percentage Size** (Similar to #1, but instead calculates based on the total size of the position)- [https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/positionpercentcalculator.html](https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/positionpercentcalculator.html)

A lengthy tutorial has also been added, which can be found at the top by clicking **More Info** on each page, or visit here - [https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/calculatorinstructions.html](https://www.positionsizingcalculator.com/calculatorinstructions.html)

I've also written up a step-by-step tutorial on how to properly assess risk management based on a recent setup for a trade - HEI - which can be found in our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/yWFavAVQpm)under the channel #risk-management.

Below that channel is one for this calculator, so feel free to post any suggestions or improvements or bugs that you find.

Happy number crunching!

I'm just now getting over this. An ex co worker asked for help with his laptop that is still company property before he turned it in.

1h7h6vn,https://i.redd.it/c6r14h7ux25e1.jpeg,Just for giggles,"So this isn‚Äôt the best group for this I‚Äôm sure, but I‚Äôm diagnosed bd2 and the context behind this picture largely has to do with that. 

Context: I having been living life off meds for about 5 months now. Everything has been going well, I‚Äôve been cutting back on smoking green like my shrink told me to (this was the 4th medical professional to tell me I needed to quit, but the first to provide me with factual evidence as to why I had to, info that I truly couldn‚Äôt refute). Cut to early last month‚Ä¶ I was in the process of trying to overcome various issues that developed while I was medicated the whole year prior that ultimately led to a decline in my physical health. Ie. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, the list truly goes on but I‚Äôll stop here. 

I was making good strides, went from smoking 20 bowls a day down to 3 or less in two months. I cut out pop completely and even coffee (because of how I like to drink it). The last big change I was working on making was cutting out takeout/frozen meals, as that was the main way I fed myself while on meds. Food and eating have always been a problem for me, but needing to eat every time I took my meds made it so much worse. Pair that with a chronic smoking addiction where you can‚Äôt eat unless you smoke‚Ä¶ you get the picture. 

Anyways, I  was doing that and also on my way to making it 1 bowl a day when I got the news. In the span of a single month, my blood work changed dramatically. My sugars were now officially in the diabetic range. I spiralled a little (honestly could‚Äôve gone a lot worse) and kind of went into a freeze response. The only way I know how to cope with that is to smoke‚Ä¶ so that goal has been put on hold while I grasp this new information. But I needed a place to share this interaction (see photo if you haven‚Äôt already). 

Maybe it‚Äôs not as funny as I think it is, but it tends to be easier to accept things after I joke about them. I‚Äôm still getting comfortable with it though and haven‚Äôt told many people, only my partner and dad know right now, so that‚Äôs why I wanted to share here with a bunch of strangers who might understand the feelings swirling around in my head right now. 

Ultimately, it‚Äôs not the end of the world and I‚Äôm still working on making those changes stick. Mostly because they need to now, but I‚Äôve always functioned better when something is black and white (can‚Äôt make excuses type-deal). I start group CBT this month so that should help things move along smoother too. 

Further trauma dump: all this happened after I had a tumour biopsy and was waiting for those results too üëÄ got them today and thankfully, it‚Äôs benign.

As someone working through mental health issues, especially related to ADHD and insomnia, days like today remind me that progress isn‚Äôt always linear, but it‚Äôs still progress.

# Struggling with Sleep but Still Moving Forward

I stayed up all night, struggling with insomnia, but I kept moving forward in the day. Even without sleep, I tried to stick to my routine. The day began with a cup of coffee, but I missed having a light breakfast, which is something I‚Äôll need to work on for tomorrow. I made sure to tidy my room after my GP appointment, and I felt good about keeping that part of my environment organized, even though I hadn‚Äôt had the chance to rest.

# Focusing and Managing My Time

Despite my lack of sleep, I worked on staying focused throughout the day. Using the tools I‚Äôve started implementing into my routine, like staying organized and sticking to a schedule, I felt productive. One small but meaningful task was posting on Reddit to ask about ADHD assessments in Northern Ireland. It might not seem like much, but reaching out for advice and guidance feels like a step toward taking control of my situation.

# Mental Health: Pushing Through the Struggles

The day had its emotional challenges, but I reminded myself that managing my mental health is a constant work in progress. I‚Äôm learning to cope with the doubt and frustration that come with ADHD, and it feels like a mental tug-of-war at times. I had moments of self-doubt, but I kept pushing forward. One of the biggest steps today was sending a detailed email to a few people‚Äîsharing my struggles and asking for support regarding ADHD services and diagnosis. It wasn‚Äôt an easy thing to do, but I‚Äôm proud of taking that step.

# Conclusion

I may not have everything figured out yet, and I know the road ahead will have its ups and downs, but today was a good reminder that I‚Äôm doing my best. No matter the struggle, I‚Äôll keep taking it one day at a time and celebrating the small wins along the way.Mental Health Struggles and Wins: A Day in My LifeToday has been a mix of struggles and small victories, but I‚Äôm proud of how I‚Äôve managed to push through despite the challenges.

But as this account has no connection to me, i guess i'm safe? Well, i won't give you reasons to hate me. But i am a 19yo College dropout in a temporary situation. I smoke a lot of cigarrettes and weed. Right now i'm good, starting to be productive state yet again. But i want someone to be aware of how bad i am feeling.

I did a lot of stupid mistakes as a kid, but i was a good student. I discovered myself bissexual and trans as i gradually grew up. These things are okay, but are things i have to hide. And to be honest i was bullied too much to be myself. I am a slave of society's expectations. I don't mind, but while i was a good student to the end of school, my habits destroyed my sense of a stable life. It's been four years since i got kinda relient on those.

For four years i was a lazy ass. I never studied once consistently in High School, but i did fine (luck, but oh well). As i was growing, i smoked more. I now smoke like a pack of cigs and two to three joints of hash, drink a lot of coffee, just to go through morning without thinking too much on my personal problems. When my bad memories come, daily and sometimes hourly, my heads hurt. It is a pain, but it seems it isn't a problem when i tell to my psychologist and mother.

The point is, i know how to be functional with that. But i also wish i'd die with time. Soon. Without the need of suicide, which, chill, it's not an option right now. I have some stuff to do regarding what i want to leave on the earth. But above all else, i am not dumb.

I know i am a major liar. I lied my whole life to them. I never hurted no one. But i know deep down, i am a shitty person, i won't change that idea. It is not that i want to suffer, i need to. I won't kill myself, i want all the time in the world possible to do what i want. But i refuse friendship, love and attachment. Not because i am afraid of the unknown, but i know am unworthy. This is why i live a double life. A life only in my head.

And people, please be civil. I am truly in pain, mostly psychological self-inflicted, it won't change, so just once can i see some compassion? ",1,1733425917.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I was sat in a train station coffee shop doing some work on my laptop, when a girl came up and asked if she could sit on the same table as there were no places elsewhere. 

We ended up talking quite a bit and it turns out she was heading to the same place I was, but on an earlier train service. The destination is my home city, and she was heading there for a Christmas party. 

Just as she was about to leave to catch the train, I was having an inner monologue whether to just ask if she would be comfortable sharing her number, or social media, etc.

I didn‚Äôt.

Either by lack of confidence or fear of rejection, I didn‚Äôt ask her and she ended up leaving after wishing me the best with things. I feel so deflated because we seemed to click and she was super bubbly and pretty. She told me about her Christmas party and I could realistically figure it out, but that would be very stalkerish! 

I told two of my friends about the situation and they both concluded, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot! :)‚Äù for not at least asking. 

Of course there‚Äôs always the chance she had a partner or wasn‚Äôt interested ‚Äì but either way I feel like I fumbled by not even asking. Now I‚Äôll never know for sure.

The only hope is that somehow we cross paths again in my city, or she‚Äôs on Reddit writing up a draft for a similar post. üòÇ

I ended up deciding not to attend her wedding because I genuinely couldn‚Äôt support her decision to remarry her ex-husband after the horrible way he treated her in their first marriage.

Fast forward to now: Sarah reached out to ""clear the air"" and invited me to meet for coffee. I was hopeful we could patch things up, but instead, she dropped another bombshell. She said she‚Äôs reconsidered having me as her maid of honor because she ""deserves someone who‚Äôs all in.""

Here‚Äôs the thing: Sarah *never* officially asked me to be her maid of honor. I assumed I wouldn‚Äôt be involved after telling her I wasn‚Äôt attending the wedding. So I was shocked when she suggested I should have automatically stepped into the role since ""best friends are supposed to support each other unconditionally.""

She went on to say that if I ""really loved her,"" I‚Äôd reconsider attending and standing by her side on her big day, even if I didn‚Äôt agree with her choice. I told her I couldn‚Äôt do that in good conscience, and now she‚Äôs upset with me again, claiming I‚Äôve ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù her by not fulfilling my ‚Äúduty‚Äù as her best friend.

At this point, I feel like I‚Äôm stuck between sticking to my values and salvaging a friendship that feels increasingly one-sided. AITA for refusing to take on the maid of honor role after everything that‚Äôs happened?",139,1733425577.0,AmItheAsshole,107,0.95,False

aita for getting my own apartment? 

I, M27, have a roommate that's also my best friend and like he's my brother. I love him so much but I've been doing pretty good financially lately from my acting job and thinking of getting my own apartment. I saw an amazing apartment and told him I wanna get it. I think he's mad at me leaving but I don't want a roommate forever even if it's with him, it's not like we're Bert and Ernie. It's not like we won't be friends anymore just because I moved out. So, am i the asshole for moving out? 

update: my best friend got a new roommate that's crazy and creepy but it's okay cos the movie writers got mad at me, wrote my character off by falling down an elevator shaft so I'm currently unemployed. my amazing best friend got rid of his crazy roommate and let me back in. im thinking of getting a job as a waiter in our favorite coffee shop where we hang out a lot while waiting for an acting job.

1h7gu0n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7gu0n,Victorinox reparado (modelo desconocido) en espa√±ol y english üòâ,"Buenas, Victorinoxfilos!. Como dec√≠a en mi post anterior (Victorinox destroyed), no pude agregar m√°s fotos porque soy un poquito nuevo en Reddit.
Soy argentino y sordo oralizado. Empec√© hace poco con la afici√≥n al Victorinox.
Ayer hab√≠a comprado una Victorinox usada por 19900 pesos (20 d√≥lares) en muy malas condiciones porque fue prestada a uno que la us√≥ en √Åfrica. Al parecer, era un verdadero bruto sin muchos conocimientos sobre el Victorinox y la us√≥ tan mal, superando sus l√≠mites. 
Como pueden ver en la foto:
1) Faltaba la pinza y el escarbadientes.
2) La sierra perdi√≥ la punta y costaba sacarla.
3) La hoja peque√±a de cuchillo estaba rota.
4) Las cachas est√°n rotas.
5) La punta destornillador del destapador desapareci√≥.
6) La tijera ten√≠a el resorte roto.
Se notaba que no le tuvieron mucho respeto...
Ten√≠a dos opciones de acuerdo a los posteos que hab√≠a le√≠do.
1) Llevarla al representante oficial de Victorinox, Bowie y cruzar los dedos porque no sab√≠a si se pod√≠a arreglar o que me pod√≠a resultar muy caro.
2) C√≥mo muchos dec√≠an, si no me pod√≠an o no quieren arreglar, mandaba la cortaplumas a Suiza con el riesgo de que tanto la Aduana como el Correo, o me roban o no me dejan enviar o simplemente se ""pierde"". A√∫n as√≠, si llegaba bien a Suiza, el env√≠o me podr√≠a resultar tan caro como comprar una nueva. De Buenos Aires a Suiza... Cu√°nto me costar√≠a?. A√∫n no lo averig√ºe.
Decid√≠ probar suerte al d√≠a siguiente yendo a Bowie.
Se me present√≥ un pibe llamado V√≠ctor (qu√© casualidad...!) y mediante escrito, nos comunicamos para evitar malos entendidos pues a veces me cuesta entender con la lectura labial.
Me propuso arreglar hoy mismo en menos de una hora y media por 19000 pesos y despu√©s de pensar un poco, acept√©.
Fui a tomar un caf√© mientras ve√≠a a los piqueteros (cada vez menos!!!) empezar otra marcha a Plaza de Mayo. 
A las 12 en punto como me prometi√≥, aparece V√≠ctor y casi me desmayo de sorpresa. No pod√≠a creer que estaba ya arreglada!!!. 
A√∫n no estoy seguro qu√© modelo es. Me dijo que es un Camper XL pero no lo encontr√© en los registros. Otro dice que es un Huntsman pero no se parece porque no tiene el gancho. 
Qu√© modelo puede ser?
Un Camper nuevo cuesta 60000 pesos y un Huntsman, m√°s de 80000 pesos. 
Conclusi√≥n: compra 19900 pesos y reparaci√≥n 19000. Total: 38900 pesos (38 d√≥lares) en menos de 48 horas. Una ganga!!!. Me gan√© tiempo evitando mandar a Suiza y me evit√© los nervios y la incertidumbre si la mandaba!.

Hello Victorinoxfilos! As I said in my previous post (Victorinox destroyed), I couldn't add more photos because I'm a little new to Reddit.
I'm Argentine and deaf. I recently started with the Victorinox hobby.
Yesterday I had bought a used Victorinox for 19,900 pesos (20 dollars) in very bad condition because it was lent to someone who used it in Africa. Apparently, he was a real brute without much knowledge about Victorinox and we used it so badly, exceeding its limits. 
As you can see in the photo:
1) The clamp and toothpicks were missing.
2) The saw lost its tip and it was difficult to remove it.
3) The small knife blade was broken.
4) The handles are broken.
5) The screwdriver tip of the bottle opener disappeared.
6) The scissors had a broken feature.
 It was obvious that they didn't have much respect for it...
I had two options according to the posts I had read.
1) Take it to the official Victorinox representative, Bowie, and cross my fingers because I didn't know if it could be fixed or that it could be very expensive.
2) As many said, if they couldn't or didn't want to fix it, I would send the knife to Switzerland with the risk that both Customs and the Post Office would either steal it or not let me send it or it would simply get ""lost."" Even so, if it arrived safely in Switzerland, the shipping could be as expensive as buying a new one. From Buenos Aires to Switzerland... How much would it cost me? I still haven't found out.
I decided to try my luck the next day by going to Bowie.
A guy named Victor introduced himself to me (what a coincidence...!) and we communicated in writing to avoid misunderstandings because sometimes I have a hard time understanding with lip reading.
 He offered to fix it today in less than an hour and a half for 19,000 pesos and after thinking a bit, I accepted.
I went to have a coffee while I watched the picketers (less and less!!!) start another march to Plaza de Mayo. 
At 12 o'clock as he promised, Victor showed up and I almost fainted from surprise. I couldn't believe it was already fixed!!!. 
I'm still not sure what model it is. He told me it's a Camper XL but I couldn't find it in the records. Another says it's a Huntsman but it doesn't look like it because it doesn't have the hook. 
What model could it be?
A new Camper costs 60,000 pesos and a Huntsman, more than 80,000 pesos. 
Conclusion: purchase 19,900 pesos and repair 19,000. Total: 38,900 pesos (38 dollars) in less than 48 hours. A bargain!!!.  I saved myself time by not sending it to Switzerland and I avoided the nerves and uncertainty if I sent it!",4,1733425245.0,victorinox,0,0.83,False

1h7gtak,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1h7gtak/new_to_the_community_looking_to_give_some/,New to the community. Looking to give some motivation to the lonely,"Hello, this is my first post in this group. I‚Äôm 25M. I‚Äôve had a lot of emotional pain throughout my life and for the first time I feel that I‚Äôm starting to get over my past traumas and what was borderline crippling anxiety.

I wish I could give you better advice than this but all I can say is please don‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôm 25 and I met the love of my life a little more than a year ago. Before I met her I was in the same boat being rejected or ghosted by all but one other woman I asked out. I have no idea what I may have been doing wrong as I was the same to her as I was to all the women I tried to pursue. I truly believe if you don‚Äôt give up the right person will come along eventually and they will do so when you least expect it. For the time try to focus on as many things that make you happy as you can. Hobby‚Äôs, getting ahead at work or whatever. I also believe that attempting to put your mind in a happier place despite the loneliness will make it easier to talk to women with confidence. But please just don‚Äôt give up hope. I‚Äôd been so lonely my entire life that I have actually planned on ending my life twice. And both times something happened that I can only describe as a pure miracle. When I was 14 I was gonna stay home sick and do it. That morning when I told my mom I was sick and not going to school, somehow she harnessed her mothers intuition I guess because she thought I might try to do something like that and she stayed home with me and gave me a semi happy day. The second and last time I was 21. I decided I was going to do it and thought to myself I‚Äôd love to get a cup of my favorite coffee before I wrote the note. Well I‚Äôm in the drive thru of the coffee shop and there‚Äôs a tent at the end of the drive thru that was promoting something. The way it was set up, I was going to have to drive by this group and sit in line next to them for a minute. I shit you not this group was spreading awareness for suicide prevention. I mean what are the odds. Then right before I turned 24 I matched with the love of my life on bumble. I matched with her only a few days after getting out of the one other relationship I‚Äôve ever had. As I was messaging her I realized that this girl was really cool but that I did not have the mental capacity to try and start a new relationship right after one ended. So I told her exactly that and apologized. She said it was cool, gave me her number and told me to hit her up when I was ready. Well about 2 weeks later I was ready lol. I ended up meeting her and the rest is history.

Two years ago I thought I‚Äôd never find love. Two years ago I didn‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd be alive right now. One month ago I proposed to my girlfriend and she said yes. And now I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been in my entire life. None of my other life problems matter now that I have her. Two years from now you could be in the same position as me and you won‚Äôt know it until it happens.

I know I may be a little younger than you and may have been alone longer than me but please just do not give up. Keep persisting. If a woman doesn‚Äôt work out I know it hurts so much every time but you‚Äôve gotta keep going. I really believe if you keep at it you will find your soul mate sooner than later. But fair warning. The girl I dated for 3 months before meeting my fianc√© was the first girl that showed me any attention at all. I immediately believed I loved her but she was not the one. Thankfully our breakup was not bad or messy but you will fall in love with the first woman you date for more than a month. When I broke up with her I thought it was really over for me. All these years it took me to find someone who liked me and it didn‚Äôt work out. That sent me spinning but little did I know I was going to meet the one a month later. So no matter what happens, do not give up!!

I believe in you and I truly hope you find your soulmate as soon as possible. Know that the pain you‚Äôre going through now is going to amplify the joy you‚Äôll have when finding her by 10x.",1,1733425203.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1h7gpdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1h7gpdr/tales_from_akron_pt_1/,"Tales from Akron, pt. 1","TL;DR: We left for Akron, OH from Youngstown, and had a couple of stumbles along the way. Things are possibly going smoothly now. 

Tuesday, the little lady and I went to Akron. Emotions were strong, neither of us slept more than five hours that night. She was anxious about being away from her family, namely her sister. I just wanted away from Youngstown. Prior to leaving the Christy House in Warren, I called ahead to the Harvest Home in Akron to check availability, and there were two beds open. 

The Greyhound left early from the Federal Station in downtown Youngstown ten minutes early, which I didn't mind and found interesting, as the bus I meant to take coming to Youngstown at the end of March skipped Akron and I spent 13 hours at RKP Station in Akron, four of those in \~30 degree overnight temps while I awaited my overnight bus to Youngstown. Maybe this was the universe's sign to me that maybe I should have stayed in Akron. 

My girlfriend spent the better part of the trip on the bus on her phone. I remarked on signs, remembering sights I saw from Akron now illuminated by the foggy morning sun. Lake Milton, whom I last saw reflecting Lady Luna, sparkled beautifully like a sea of glitter. We chatted a few times about things I saw on my first trip to Akron, like corn fields and even the Pro Football HOF in Canton, and a bit about the bus station in Akron. 

Her eyes lit up when she saw the spiky RKP Station. I know she wasn't expecting such an illustrious building to be a bus station. I also pointed out the Canton Express pulling in, as I told her before Akron had busses going to Canton and Cleveland and allowed for a wider variety of activities. Inside though, she was visibly at unease. She also wasn't expecting as many people. 

I grabbed a quesadilla from the Urbean Caf√©, route guides to the Harvest Home and the library and a pair of day passes. We actually missed our first bus to the library, and the 15 minute wait for the bus passed by. 

At the library, we got cards and I notified her sister we had arrived. The Harvest Home was now full. Entering panic mode as Chronos was in his winter hours, we visited the Home and were invited to supper - but the catch was attending service. I didn't mind. 

After a filling supper of Thanksgiving leftovers, we went to the Home's Safe Harbor overnight room. We relaxed, though for a bit as the emotions of being away from her family, and the home she had known for the last five years, had reached a point and she succumbed to them in my arms, while I faced the wrath of her sister for ""being reckless"". (But were we? Plans are not guaranteed 100%, and can derail like a train with the smallest of pebble on the tracks). We went to sleep hoping tomorrow would be different. 

But no. Wednesday's episode was just Tuesday's rerun. More library, more calling, more cold, more wind and snow, another night at the Home, more turkey...until this morning, when we were invited to speak with the women's client services supervisor. We were taken in, bags searched, drugs tested for, and a lunch of more turkey. 

From what it seems, the Harvest Home is a lot better than the Rescue Mission in Youngstown. You wont be kicked for not having the sheets on your bed tight enough, or for giving the office worker a strange look, or even because said worker believed a rumor spread about you. The meals are a lot more filling. The people are lot more friendly and seem more trustworthy than whatever scum the Mission accepted. It seems less military-ish and less facility-ish. Bible study is mandatory, but your belief isn't. At the Mission, any deviance from Evangelical beliefs was grounds for dismissal. 

I really hope Akron treats us well. I believe more people means more resources, but that also means more people going for those resources. 

I also don't creatively write as well, but I'm running on three cups of coffee and an 12 oz Red Bull.

* Goth Club '89 - was curious despite knowing from the notes that this wasn't ever going to be for me. Dark and dank (to me).
* Strawberry Fandango - what a strawberry party, but the myrrh bothers my nose and gives me a headache. The vanilla also goes weird and makes this strawberry party into a weird strawberry party candy.",4,1733424521.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False
1h7gj8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1h7gj8d/annihilation_pt_1/,Annihilation Pt 1,"Deep space has always seemed beautiful to me. The endless void that stretches beyond the horizon into unfathomable depths, the existence of stars, planets, and cosmic phenomena offer a gateway to the unknown. It‚Äôs a place where the boundaries of science blur, paving the way for discoveries in regions untouched by human knowledge.¬†

When you‚Äôre floating aimlessly through the cosmos, the silence can often weigh heavily upon you and the solitude and boredom of space can be‚Ä¶. *haunting*, and I would agree. In the vastness of the Interstellar void, you are but a whisper, merely insignificant against the backdrop of infinite obscurity. Earth could never match the exhilarating isolation of space.		

My mission was anything but simple, and what it was no longer matters. To be honest, I‚Äôd rather spare you the details‚Äîfor your own safety. Just know this: I wasn‚Äôt a man of faith, not before. But now... I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.¬†

Three weeks ago, HQ had intercepted a transmission from an unknown signal. We‚Äôve encountered similar transmissions before which are often misidentified as echoes from nearby satellites‚Äîthis one was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶quite different.¬†

\*	\*	\*

When I emerged from my standard cryo-pod, there was an incessant beeping echoing through the command deck. A message from HQ‚Ä¶ I tapped the console, bringing the message into clearer focus. The voice crackled through the comms, tense but steady.

""Captain Cross... We‚Äôve received a transmission from the Rosette Nebula... but something‚Äôs off. The signal is weak, distorted‚Äîbarely holding. It's not on any known frequency. We can‚Äôt trace the source.""

I blinked at the flickering display, trying to wrap my head around it. The Rosette Nebula? That‚Äôs over 5,000 light-years away‚Ä¶ *How is it reaching us now?*

""Are we certain that the signal is not from a stray satellite?"" I asked, initializing the caffeine synth dispenser. It hummed to life, producing the liquid in seconds.

""Confirmed, Captain,"" the comms officer responded, his voice steady. ""The signal‚Äôs unique‚Äîit‚Äôs being transmitted by a device specifically calibrated to penetrate the dense dust clouds of the Rosette Nebula. No other tech in this sector uses this frequency.""

I stared at the monitor, unsettled. The nebula's gas clouds might be interfering... but a signal from that distance? It shouldn't even be possible.

‚ÄúPatch it through,‚Äù I ordered, my voice calm, though the air felt heavier around me. There was a long pause, a static hiss, then the screen illuminated, revealing some sort of notations

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúHave we deciphered them yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly the first 3 notations‚Äù

‚Ä¶. A-N-N‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently working to decode the remaining characters‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll maintain standby for any incoming transmission. Have we received any data bursts or signals from the Nebula Explorer V1?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We‚Äôve isolated Connors in quarantine protocols. It appears he's gone into self-confinement for now, but we're working on extracting him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four weeks since our last deployment and four days without contact. Are we certain he‚Äôs stable?‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain. His biometrics are active and nominal.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off. I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about this‚Ä¶ Maybe I should initiate a manual inspection.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. Protocol is clear‚Äîyour directive is to remain on standby. We can‚Äôt authorize an EVA transfer to the other vessel. Resume your current assignments and await further instructions.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôll proceed with my scheduled tasks for the day‚Äù¬†

A brief silence followed, then came the crisp response: ‚ÄòAffirmative, Captain.‚Äô‚Äù

I‚Äôve been running diagnostics on the ship‚Äôs propulsion systems for the past few days, ensuring all modules are functioning within optimal parameters. My next task was to recalibrate the oxygen filtration system, but honestly, that‚Äôs routine at this point. HQ had also assigned me to monitor deep space comms, the Nebula Explorer V1 was the vessel sent before me. Between that and the scheduled exterior hull inspection later this week, I‚Äôve had my hands full.¬†

Still, none of these tasks were enough to distract me from the uneasy silence coming from Connors. Four days without contact‚Äîit‚Äôs gnawing at me‚Ä¶.

\*	\*	\*

‚ÄúConnors, have you ever thought about what‚Äôs out there?‚Äù I asked him one evening, the low hum of the ship‚Äôs systems providing a backdrop to our conversation. We were in the common area, sipping recycled coffee as we stared out at the stars.

He leaned back in his chair, a distant look in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou mean besides the endless void? Yeah, I‚Äôve thought about it. But what‚Äôs really out there? It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ vast emptiness. It can get overwhelming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. On one hand, it‚Äôs beautiful. On the other, it‚Äôs suffocating. It‚Äôs hard to shake the feeling of isolation.‚Äù

Connors sighed, scratching his chin. ‚ÄúYou know, when I signed up for this mission, I thought I‚Äôd be doing something monumental. Discovering new worlds, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs worth it. The solitude can feel like a weight pressing down on you.‚Äù

I chuckled softly, trying to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúYou signed up for the trip, Connors. You knew what you were getting into‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he replied, but I noticed a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. ‚ÄúJust promise me you won‚Äôt get lost out there, okay? I‚Äôd hate to have to send a search party after you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise, my friend,‚Äù I said, raising my coffee cup in a mock toast. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a pact. If either of us goes quiet for too long, the other comes looking.‚Äù

*‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù*

I immersed myself in my daily tasks, gathering atmospheric readings, carbon pressure levels, and scanning for any new star formations in the vicinity. *That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Ä¶.*

A slow, deliberate tapping through the metal hull. It was faint at first, almost like a whisper and I mostly ignored it. Until it cut through the tranquility of the ship. I paused‚Ä¶.straining my ears against the silence that followed, only to be met with an unsettling stillness that felt almost oppressive. Then it came again, a gentle tapping, like fingers drumming on the surface of the universe itself. My pulse quickened as I stepped cautiously towards the command room.¬†

*Until the alarms deafened me‚Ä¶.*

""Status report!"" I barked, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sirens.

The ship's AI flickered to life, its voice steady but laced with urgency. ""Warning: Unidentified object detected in proximity. Trajectory indicates potential collision course. Estimated time to impact: three minutes.""

My heart raced as I glanced at the sensor readouts, a cluster of data scrolling rapidly across the screen. An unidentified object? My mind raced through possibilities, each more chilling than the last. What have I stumbled upon? an asteroid? No, the Ships AI must have identified it‚Ä¶

I gripped the console as I focused on the blaring alerts. ‚ÄúDivert all power to shields! Prepare for evasive maneuvers!‚Äù I commanded.

I couldn‚Äôt see outside; for some reason, it was dark and blurry. The vessel slammed into something. I hadn‚Äôt engaged my safety harness, and I was violently ejected from my command seat, my body tumbling against the bulkhead.

The AI hummed, its voice urgent, piercing through the chaos.

*WARNING... WARNING... WARNING...*

I couldn‚Äôt see outside. I didn‚Äôt know what I had hit‚Äîsome unseen object in the void‚Äîuntil it became silent. The alarm ceased, leaving an eerie quiet in its wake. My heart raced as I pushed myself upright, the cold metal of the console digging into my back.

‚ÄúStatus report!‚Äù I shouted, forcing my voice to remain steady despite the dread that clawed at my insides.

‚ÄúSystems compromised,‚Äù the AI replied, its tone dispassionate as ever. ‚ÄúShields at fifty percent. Hull integrity fluctuating. Unknown entity detected‚Äîlocation: 030 mark 18.‚Äù

I blinked, struggling to comprehend. Unknown entity? ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòunknown entity‚Äô? Can we identify it?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. Visual feeds are compromised. Recommend initiating external scan.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the tension knotting deeper. ‚ÄúDo it. Get me eyes on whatever we collided with.‚Äù

As the AI began its scanning process, I took a moment to gather my thoughts. The darkness outside my viewport felt oppressive, swallowing the starlight, as if the universe itself was watching me. I fought against the rising tide of panic.

‚Äú*Come on, come on‚Ä¶‚Äù* I muttered under my breath, staring at the flickering display as it struggled to process the input.

Suddenly, the screen cleared, revealing a shadowy silhouette drifting just beyond the hull. A massive structure, alien and unsettling, loomed ominously against the void. Its surface was textured, like a complex web of dark materials, pulsating with an eerie glow.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù I breathed, fear coursing through my veins. ‚ÄúAI, enhance the scan! Identify that structure!‚Äù

‚ÄúEnhancing now,‚Äù it responded. The screen pulsed as the AI processed data, but the results were slow. A dread began to settle in my gut‚Äîa feeling that whatever lay before me was more than just an object in space.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù the AI finally said, ‚ÄúI cannot identify the structure. Preliminary scans indicate it emits an unusual energy signature. Suggest caution in approaching.‚Äù

Caution? I was already too close. My heart raced as I tried to think clearly, weighing my options. Should I attempt to maneuver away? Or would it be better to try and communicate?

I hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at me. Just then, a series of faint vibrations reverberated through the ship. It felt like a heartbeat, rhythmic and steady, sending shivers down my spine.

‚ÄúAI, did you detect that?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúAffirmative. The structure appears to be reacting to our presence. Energy levels are rising.‚Äù

With a sinking feeling, I realized the entity had noticed me. Whatever it was, it was alive‚Äî*and it was watching***.**

‚ÄúPrepare for any incoming transmissions,‚Äù I ordered, adrenaline pumping through me. ‚ÄúWe need to know what we‚Äôre dealing with.‚Äù

But as I waited, the silence returned, heavier this time, as if the very fabric of space held its breath. I felt utterly exposed, trapped in a cocoon of darkness, with only the unknown entity before me.

‚ÄúAI, keep the shields at maximum,‚Äù I commanded, feeling a knot of fear tighten in my stomach. ‚ÄúIf it decides to attack, I want to be ready.‚Äù

Then, as abruptly as it had started, everything fell silent. The oppressive stillness enveloped me, leaving only the sound of my own heartbeat echoing in my ears. I was alone with my thoughts, the tension thick enough to slice.

The darkness outside the viewport pressed against the hull like a weight, a reminder of the vast, uncaring universe surrounding me. I could almost feel the cold expanse of space wrapping around my ship, isolating me further from any sense of normalcy. My mind raced, piecing together the fragments of what had just occurred. What had I hit?

I forced myself to take a deep breath, steadying my pulse. I had to assess the situation. I fumbled for the control panel, my fingers brushing against the cold metal as I reestablished my grip. The interface flickered to life, the dim glow illuminating the command deck like a distant star in the void.

‚ÄúAI, status check!‚Äù I commanded, my voice steadier than I felt.

‚ÄúSystems are nominal,‚Äù the AI replied, its synthesized voice echoing through the stillness. ‚ÄúHowever, navigational sensors are offline, and visual feeds remain compromised. Energy levels are fluctuating within normal parameters.‚Äù

Normal? The word felt almost absurd in this context. ‚ÄúWhat about external scans? Can you provide any data on what we collided with?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ no significant anomalies detected in the immediate vicinity. The object is classified as an unknown entity. Energy readings indicate a strong electromagnetic field surrounding it.‚Äù

I squinted at the monitor, frustration gnawing at me. ‚ÄúGive me a visual feed if you can.‚Äù

The screen pulsed, and for a brief moment, static danced across the display before settling on an image‚Äîa vast, shadowy mass drifted silently beyond my hull, its contours indistinct in the darkness, yet undeniably present.

‚ÄúCan you enhance that?‚Äù I asked, my breath catching in my throat.

‚ÄúEnhancing image‚Ä¶ completed,‚Äù the AI responded. The silhouette sharpened, revealing a complex structure, interwoven with what appeared to be organic-like tendrils that pulsated faintly, as if alive.

My heart raced; *‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that?*‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown,‚Äù the AI repeated. ‚ÄúFurther scans are required to ascertain its properties and intentions. Recommend maintaining a safe distance while attempting to establish communication protocols.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. Communication? I didn‚Äôt want to communicate with whatever the hell this thing was

‚ÄúCan we initiate contact?‚Äù

‚ÄúAttempting to establish contact,‚Äù the AI replied, the console lighting up with a series of beeps and whirs.

I gripped the edge of the control panel, anticipation thrumming in my veins. A moment passed, the silence wrapping around me like a shroud. Then came the response‚Äîa low-frequency hum, resonating through the ship, sending vibrations rattling through the hull.

Œî ‚àÖ | # | ‚ÖÉ Œî ‚ä§ | ‚àò ‚àÖ

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I whispered, staring at the screen as it displayed a notation.

‚ÄúUnidentified transmission detected,‚Äù the AI stated. ‚ÄúFrequency modulation is inconsistent with known communication methods.‚Äù

It sounded almost‚Ä¶ organic, like the pulse of a heartbeat echoing in the stillness.

‚ÄúCan you decode it?‚Äù I pressed, every instinct telling me to be cautious.

‚ÄúOnly three Initials; A-N-N....Insufficient data to decipher further intent or meaning. Recommend further analysis and monitoring.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mind racing. Here I was, a speck in the void, facing a phenomenon that defied everything I knew about the universe. I was on the edge of discovery‚Äîor *destruction*.

‚ÄúPrepare to initiate a deep-space scan of that entity,‚Äù I ordered, forcing myself to maintain focus despite the rising tide of uncertainty. ‚ÄúAnd keep the shields at full power. I don‚Äôt want to find out what it can do.‚Äù

A small static came when the AI replied, ‚ÄúAffirmative, Captain.‚Äù

As I settled into my seat, the weight of isolation pressed down on me again. I was alone, drifting through the depths of space, waiting to uncover the secrets of an entity that seemed all too aware of my presence. Suddenly, HQ crackled to life over the comms, the voice of my superior cutting through the silence. ‚ÄúCaptain Cross‚Ä¶ Report your findings‚Ä¶‚Äù

I straightened in my seat, adrenaline coursing through me. ‚ÄúCommander Hayes, I‚Äî‚Äù My voice faltered for a moment as I glanced at the ominous mass on the screen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve encountered an unknown entity in the vicinity. The collision has compromised navigational sensors, but I‚Äôm attempting to assess its properties.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnknown entity?‚Äù Hayes‚Äôs tone was sharp, laced with urgency. ‚ÄúAre you in danger?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù I replied, trying to maintain my composure. ‚ÄúThe entity appears to be‚Ä¶ alive, or at least it has organic characteristics. It‚Äôs emitting a low-frequency signal that I‚Äôm currently analyzing. I recommend sending a probe to gather more data before we make any decisions.‚Äù

‚ÄúNegative, Captain. We cannot risk losing another asset. Maintain distance and gather intel from your current position. Can you confirm the object‚Äôs stability?‚Äù

‚ÄúStability is unclear. It‚Äôs pulsating and‚Äî‚Äù My words caught in my throat as the entity shifted slightly on the screen. *It‚Ä¶‚Ä¶What the fuck‚Ä¶. It seems to be reacting to my presence.‚Äù*

‚ÄúIs it attempting communication?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù I admitted, my eyes narrowing at the screen. The pulsing intensified, the low hum deepening in tone, resonating in a way that felt almost‚Äîintentional. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ trying to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúCaptain, you‚Äôre to prioritize your safety above all else. Do not engage unless absolutely necessary,‚Äù Hayes warned, his voice steely.¬†

I clenched my fists, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. ‚ÄúCommander, if this entity poses a threat, we might not have the luxury of waiting. If we don‚Äôt act now, we could lose the opportunity to understand it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour priority is to ensure the safety of the mission,‚Äù he repeated firmly. ‚ÄúMaintain monitoring and keep me updated. HQ out.‚Äù

The comms went silent again, leaving me in the oppressive quiet of the command deck. I glanced at the console, the waveform still pulsing in front of me. The low-frequency hum began to shift again, its rhythm changing, more urgent now.

‚ÄúAI, can you analyze that change in the signal?‚Äù I asked, my heart racing.

‚ÄúAnalyzing‚Ä¶ The signal exhibits patterns reminiscent of communication methods unrecognizable,‚Äù the AI reported. ‚ÄúPossible attempts to convey a message. However, the modulation remains unique and indecipherable.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you approximate its intent?‚Äù

‚ÄúInsufficient data. However, it may imply curiosity or caution.‚Äù

Curiosity or caution? In the cold embrace of space, either could spell destruction.

‚ÄúActivate the external camera feed,‚Äù I ordered. The display flickered, and the viewport illuminated, revealing the entity in full view. It's dark mass loomed large against the backdrop of stars, its tendrils undulating slowly, almost as if they were breathing.

‚ÄúAI, initiate a slow rotation of the ship. I want to get a full visual of this thing without moving too close,‚Äù I instructed, hoping to buy time while my mind raced through the possibilities.

‚ÄúAffirmative,‚Äù the AI responded, and the vessel began to turn.

As I watched the entity shift and ripple in the starlight, an unshakable feeling of dread settled over me. I had ventured into the unknown, and now *I was staring into the abyss, waiting for it to gaze back.*

After what felt like an eternity, a rhythmic sound echoed through the metallic hull of the vessel.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to ignore it, but the noise was relentless, like a heartbeat in the silence of space. There was something far more terrifying awaiting me beyond that sound‚Äîsomething that could lead the mission into‚Ä¶..*Annihilation*.



*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

The sound grew louder, filling the empty corridors of the vessel

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tightened my grip on the control panel, feeling a chill creep up my spine despite the warmth of my suit.

I scanned the monitors, hoping to find something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat might explain the noise. Yet, the screens showed nothing but the static hum of deep space. The vast darkness loomed beyond the hull, pressing against the ship as if something massive and unseen watched from the void.

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

I tried to focus on the entity‚Ä¶. *But this noise‚Ä¶* this endless, insistent drumming‚Ä¶ was like a warning, echoing from some primal depth I couldn‚Äôt understand.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, casting strange shadows across the bridge. I forced myself to breathe, slow and steady, but my heart raced in time with that infernal beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

A faint voice crackled through the comm system. ‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶‚Äù

I froze. That voice‚Äîit sounded distorted, stretched by static, but familiar. *Impossible*.¬†

*Conners? My voice ached‚Ä¶..*

‚Äú*Ethan‚Ä¶.‚Äù*

The lights dimmed entirely, and the darkness became suffocating. The sound now pounded in my ears.

I turned, but I was alone. Or so I thought. In the shadows at the edge of the bridge, a figure began to form, outlined by the faint emergency lights. The face came last‚Äîhis face. *Conners*. He stared at me, hollow-eyed, as if peering from some eternal abyss.

*""Did you think it would end with me?‚Äù* he whispered, his voice barely more than a rasp against the drumming beat.¬†

*Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶ Tudd‚Ä¶*

Panic clawed at my mind as I took a step back, my boots heavy, rooted to the floor. I tried to speak, to explain, but words failed.

And then, as I watched, he stepped forward, his gaze burning with a fury that transcended death, his figure shifting and flickering like static on a broken screen.

‚Äú*Ethan*‚Ä¶..‚Äù he murmured, each syllable dripping with bitterness. ""*You will face it too as I have faced*‚Ä¶..*Complete and utter‚Ä¶.Annihilation*""

1h7gcy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1h7gcy6/continuing_to_share_my_column_in_the_newspaper/,"Continuing to share my column in the newspaper ""Bikes: the better way to travel""","This morning as I was pulling out of the driveway of my apartment building, my neighbour whizzed by on a bright yellow gravel bike.

I was excited, because I recognized this bike. It‚Äôs often locked up at an office building just down the way from where I work. I realized that this was a chance for an experiment. I was going to see who would get to work first: me, a driver navigating traffic, construction and finding parking, or him, a cyclist on the same route, but with a clear bike lane and the ability to just roll up to the front door.

The race was on.

It wasn‚Äôt long before he lost me. After the first set of lights, for which he dutifully waited until they turned green before proceeding, he was gone. I was stuck behind a few other cars and he had a clear lane all to himself at the side of the road. The bike lane bypasses the next few lights, and he was quickly out of sight. I tried to see if he was crossing the bridge or riding up the hill, but he was long gone. I figured he‚Äôd take a more direct route than I, since he didn‚Äôt have to worry about going around to the back of the building where the parking lot is. By the time I‚Äôd parked and walked around to the front door, the bike was locked up outside and the rider was probably already sipping his first cup of coffee. He had handily won.

Oh my GOD, the fact that you're even ASKING this is SO telling about your decision-making abilities and general life choices. Let me break down this tragic situation:

You're clearly one of those people who:
- Takes 15 minutes at the counter while everyone behind you silently plots your demise
- Probably posts Instagram stories of every coffee you get, complete with those insufferable ""but first, coffee!"" captions
- Can't commit to basic choices without crowdsourcing opinions

It's frickin' DECEMBER. December 5th to be exact. The fact you're even CONSIDERING a cold latte right now screams ""I'm trying to be different."" You're either:
1. Someone who wears shorts in winter to prove how ""tough"" you are
2. Desperately trying to cling to summer because you can't accept seasonal changes
3. The type who orders ice cream in a blizzard just to be ""quirky""

Just get the hot latte like a normal person dealing with winter. Unless you're one of those chronically online workers who never leaves their apartment and has no concept of outside temperature? The type whose only exposure to weather is through their apartment window while doom-scrolling?

But let me guess - you'll probably end up getting both, won't you? One for now, one for later, because you're ""treating yourself"" or whatever justification you use for your daily coffee budget that could probably fund a small country.

So what's it gonna be? Are you going to make a sensible choice for once in your life, or are you going to be that person wearing fingerless gloves while clutching an iced latte in December?

We're a household of 4 people and have lived together for about 3 years now. One roommate's parents donated a tv for us to use and one night while we had our mutual friends hanging out, it got hit and the screen messed up. We haven't had a working tv in the living room since then.

When we did have the tv, we would all use it. Sometimes, I wouldn't use it for a month because I didn't feel like hanging out in the living room, while other roommates did. We'd all share living room space equally without question. I've been wanting to get a tv since I know we all enjoyed it, so I asked if anyone else would be able to pitch in for the cost. I'm talking a 1/4 of the cost of probably a $300 tv, so it's not like that's breaking the bank. My roommates would say they would be down when they get paid next but for some reason every time I brought it up, they didn't have enough to pitch in.

Mind you, they never have pitched in for any of the communal furniture. Most of the stuff we have was given to us luckily by parents or a friend. I've had to buy the bar stools in our kitchen, the bbq in the backyard that everyone has used, and home decor to make our home look nice. Honestly, we were so lucky with people giving us hand me down furniture, we probably wouldn't even have a couch or coffee table if not.

So I got sick of waiting for them and I bought a new tv for the living room. I went ahead and installed a code to access the tv when turned on. My roommates haven't asked about it yet, but I know they will especially if one of them decides to have friends over. It just pisses me of thinking of them using the tv for their own down time without pitching in, knowing they would use it. When I have friends over or when we're all hanging out, sure I'm down to share, but atp I feel slighted because of all the things I've contributed to the household for everyone to use.

AITA for adding a code to the tv I bought in the living room and limiting access for roommates to use?

EDIT: Since the comments have said YTA and put the TV in my bedroom. I'll add more context. I have a TV in my bedroom. I have the master bedroom. Lately when we have our friends over, we move to my room to watch sports or youtube clips, whatever. Naturally, everyone wants to go into my room because it's the biggest room. When I invite our friends over, my roommates will also naturally hangout with us. So I've basically been using my room to host our friends and hangout with roommates. This is also why I'd like the TV in the living room, to get away from everyone using my room to watch TV.

Also communal furniture I didn't buy was given to either my parent or our mutual friend, whom of which I initiated the asking and organizing the delivery/pickup.

I just do.","Context: My parents have never been together, they had me as teenagers, my mum and I moved hours away when I was a baby so I saw my dad a couple times a year. I would usually just get dropped off at my grandparents by him because he didn't ever really know how to talk to children or really entertain etc. I was cared for but he really just paraded me around to show me off to other friends/relatives or bring me along to hang out with his friends house. All that to say, we never had a strong bond. He got married when I was 13 and I hand somewhat of a bond with his wife and my step sister, I would stay during holidays but my dad was just typical narcissist and treated me as a maid and projected his disdain for my mum onto me as much as possible. 

He doesn't have a close relationship with his parents, he was an extremely difficult teenager (attacking his dad, explosive tantrums, just a bit off the rails). In summary: a very hateful, aggressive, mysoginistic person. 

He has a bit of an obsession with trying to convey to the outer world that he and I have some kind of bond. Of course, he has never done anything behind close doors to nurture this - he refused to pay any child support my entire life because he hated my mother so much and didn't want to give money to her. 

Anyway.. I'm giving this context because I need advice and I think it's important to note this is not the sort of father I've felt abandoned by and he hasn't ever 'abused' me as such, it's just a matter of me hating him because he is a horrible man and he gives me the ""ick"". 

Whenever he can get me alone, even if it's in a hallway or the back of a room he slyly and subtly spits passive aggressive remarks to me about me avoiding him. This has sent me into a panic at a few family functions because he will follow me around and then start laying into me in a ""jokey"" way about how he feels discluded by me. A few months ago he was dropping off a birthday present for me and as soon as my other family were out of ear shot he said ""Well you've managed to avoid me for this long"" and pointed to my playstation and said ""Let me guess - you don't play anything I could play with you?"" in a super pathetic tone. It feels really awkward. 

He has been harrassing me to go for coffee/lunch for years and I always avoid it. I agreed with my grandparents that he could just come over to their house and we can all have lunch together so I don't need to be alone with him. I just have this feeling he's going to confront me about avoiding him and I don't actually have an explanation because I can't say ""you just make my skin crawl."" 

I don't want to tell him I don't like him because I don't want him to make any effort to bond with me. I am now 30 years old and I just view him as a horrible relative who is fixated on me. He has a sister who went no contact with him for many years because he was so aggressive infront of her children too many times and he would constantly bring up the fact his sister cut him off for ""no reason"". I don't want to argue with him or talk to him about anything because he truly cannot be reasoned with, his tactic is to act radically confused whenever someone expresses an issue to him. 

I don't even know what I'm asking for here. I don't know. I just feel nothing for this man, aside from disdain.. he's a really really shit person but because I've avoided him as much as possible I don't even have a good reason to hold against him as to why I want nothing to do with him. It's just his persona. He follows me, stands looming over me, stares at me, baffled by everything I say and interrogates me about my life. He is universally disliked. As mentioned, he does have a wife but she absolutely has a dependency on painkillers so I guess that's how she copes. 

Anyone got a similar dynamic? 

To make matters worse my primary parent, my mother, is also a narcissist! So I've always been in the middle and had to face their projection of their big teenager breakup. They're obsessef with how much they hate eachother even though now they are both nearly in their 50s. Boring!  ",1,1733423616.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Hello! Last month was busy with work, and we're ready to share news about our latest updates. Are you ready? Grab a coffee (or whatever else keeps you energized), and let's dive into the updates!

# 1.¬†Scaling Without Limits: Backend Update

We‚Äôve refactored the backend. 80% of all updates are not visible to users, but you will notice their impact through improved service quality.

# 2.¬†Dark Mode: Your Eyes Will Thank You

We know many of you work late into the night, so we‚Äôve released an update, especially for your eyes! Dark mode is now available in your account settings.

# 3. Improving WAF: No More False Alarms!

False blocks are now a thing of the past! We‚Äôve redesigned the WAF blocking system, so the chance of a false block is now just 0.1%‚Äîand that's no joke. If the WAF thinks you‚Äôre a bot, an additional check will be performed, taking about 30 seconds. No CAPTCHAs for you, just peace of mind and full focus on your tasks!

# 4. Migration to Centrifugo: Even Safer, Even More Reliable

Real-time events now run on Centrifugo. Previously, sockets were handled by our backend, but now it‚Äôs a dedicated service with its own SDK, which significantly reduces the load on the system.

# 5. Enhanced DDoS Protection: Smart and Invisible

In foreign locations, DDoS protection no longer drops the first connection (goodbye, TCP Reset). In Moscow, we‚Äôve updated our protection rules with help from our partners at StormWall.

Soon, we‚Äôll add the ability to configure protection rules directly from your account, so you can tailor them to your projects and sleep easy!

# 6. Hardware Upgrade: Ryzen 9 9950X and 25G Ports

Faster than you can say ""ping""!

In Moscow and Germany, we've upgraded to AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processors and 25G ports for our VPS.

# 7. Sweden is Now Even Closer

We‚Äôve improved network connectivity in Sweden, so now users from the CIS countries can reach Sweden via a shorter route. Our talented engineers continue to optimize routes to minimize latency and maximize bandwidth!

# Conclusion:

We‚Äôve made a lot of improvements to ensure your projects are safe and reliable. Dark mode, WAF updates, Centrifugo, DDoS protection, and powerful hardware‚Äîeverything to make your partnership with us even stronger.

>*üéâ May your servers run smoothly, and your code compile on the first try. Here‚Äôs to new achievements!*

I cross paths with this girl from the subway, through every transfer, walk to work, same elevator, and building. I'm 100% sure that me not opening up built up way too much tension between us, and it's awkward at this point, but she has given me no social cues or behaviors that suggest her being open to being approached.

She wears headphones so that closes off the chance to go beyond just waving at her, she's really shy so she just briefly looks at me, we look at each other for like 0.5 seconds. Where do I approach her and how? I can't ask her out in a elevator (not the best place) and brief interactions make it hard. Should I compliment something and ask her if she's open to getting coffee at some point (but not ask for her number right away?). What if she's married, has a partner?

I thought this might be a good place to start and some people may be able to relate and have some suggestions for me. 

**I apologize if this is not the right place to post and I'm happy to delete if I'm wrong and this brings any triggers, etc. 

TLDR: I am struggling to eat or drink anything and feel like crap do to it. Looking for suggestions, even small, on how to get things in my body (food or drink) through out the day so I possibly can start feeling a little better mentally and physically. 

Here we go.... I do not believe I have a ""textbook"" eating disorder... but I'm struggling, and have my whole life. Recently, with all the stress, medications, anxiety, depression and medical issues (which include new diagnosis sending me in to a bit of a sprial). I'm really struggling with eating.  

I know not eating/drinking is a problem. I lost 16lbs between doctors appointments and nothing was said (they were less than a month apart). When I tell people I'm struggling I get praise on weight loss or more rude comments on wishing they could be this thin and weren't able to eat, with they were like me yadadada.  

Which leads to my issue, I do not eat. I do not drink. I really think it's effecting me mentally and physically as my body is not suffice for what it's putting out. I have my morning coffee and occasionally a sweet tea or a few sips of prime later in the day. I rarely eat all day long until my husband and kid get home, if it wasn't for them, I likely wouldn't eat at all and still sometimes don't if I'm cooking just for them. By time I'm done cooking and cleaning etc... I go back to not hungry and lose interest in the food. 

I'm never hungry. I know I need to eat I'll walk downstairs and stare in the fridge and cabinets and nothing sounds good. Same goes for dinner so I ask them what they want. Occasionally I'll pick at it but never eating a full meal. Through out work occasionally I'll snack like a few chips or something small. 

Same goes for drinks. Nothing sounds good and it's like when I try to force water my belly feels so full and bloated and I don't want any more despite knowing I need it. 

I don't know what to do or how to get myself nutrients needed. I do take a daily vitamin but I think when you're already deficient... it doesn't help much. Does anyone have any starting tips on how to eat/drink?

2. I don‚Äôt miss being sick in the mornings. It‚Äôs been a while, but I need to remember that when I was drinking, I could not ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù a cup of coffee or breakfast. 

3. It won‚Äôt actually fix whatever I want it to fix or take away whatever I don‚Äôt want to feel. 

4. It causes me to question my own reality and my own emotions. Is what I‚Äôm thinking or feeling really me? Or is it because I drank?

5. I‚Äôll only feel even more hopeless. If I think I feel bad now, when I drink, it‚Äôs a deep aching pull from the pits of hell. It‚Äôs horrible and hurts to breathe. 

6. Do I really want to go back to a life of obsession about when my next drink is? To go back to a life where I can‚Äôt enjoy anime? Books? Walks? Anything?

It's taken me a while to get to this point because I LARPed for a while and did the Dancing Monkey Routine for a while. 

**Context:** for several years My wife and I have standing date appointment to go grab breakfast on the first Friday of each month. We would drop our kids off at school go to our favorite breakfast spot and take an hour or so to just relax, eat a big breakfast and catch up unimpeded by children. It‚Äôs extremely practical, for one I don't have to pay for a sitter, two breakfast is much cheaper meal than dinner.

Eventually my wife's work shifted to her being off on Thursdays so naturally it made sense that we would change it from a Friday to a Thursday so we did. And 2 plus years we've pretty much never missed one of these dates unless there was some other major logistical hurdle which we always agreed upon beforehand and made it up.¬†

Last month she scheduled a Pure Barre class on Thursday during our breakfast date. Once she realized what she had done she tried all these gymnastics to move things around and I simply said no it's okay (OI and STFU). Later she comes moping that she was sad because she thought I was indifferent to us going on a date or not, by not making a big deal it drove her hamster crazy. I told her I have lunch free and we could do that instead this time.¬†

So once again my wife does the exact same thing so I schedule a coffee with somebody else and move on for the day. ¬†

On my MRP journey I've been learning to set my boundaries and enforce them. In the past I've been too amenable which leads to getting taken advantage of. Give an inch they take a mile. Another challenge for me has been calibrating STFU. In the beginning I had to go full retard and literally become a mute. Think of it as a hard reset to factory settings. Over time I‚Äôve gotten better not DEERing, or being needy and focusing on myself.

That being said with this most recent missed date I was actually ticked off because it shows a lack of respect for my time, schedule, and not prioritizing me. That night I say the following (paraphrasing to the best of my memory):¬†

**Me**: I wanted to let you know that I'm disappointed that you scheduled something during our breakfast date for the second time in a row.¬†

**Her**: I forgot

**Me**: You forgot last month and again this month. One time is a mistake two times is a habit.¬†

**Her**: well we used to do it on Fridays and the hurricane messed things up.¬†

**Me**: it's obviously not a priority for you. I'm not going to alter my schedule to suit you anymore.¬†

**Her**: I can change my class to 9:30 or we could do lunch¬†

**Me**: I've already booked a coffee appointment and I'm not going to do lunch with you.¬†

**Her**: well I feel like I prioritize you. I pick up the kids from school a lot so you can work later.

At this point I STFU. She's deflecting, trying to pull in other shit as if that has anything to do with her missing the dates. I knew engaging and arguing was a fool's errand and would make her feel justified and I could lose frame.¬†

A few minutes later‚Ä¶

**Her**: I do care about it and I enjoy our breakfast dates.

**Me**: Show me what someone spends their time doing and I‚Äôll show you what they prioritize. My time is my most valuable gift and if it‚Äôs not a priority to you I‚Äôm not going to build my schedule around you.

Cue long night of her on her side of the bed and me on mine. I actually slept pretty good although I couldn‚Äôt help but replay and question what I could have done better to my own advantage. My natural beta instincts were to ask if she wants to talk and to comfort her but I know it‚Äôs not my job to comfort my wife for her shitty behavior, in fact it would be detrimental to our relationship and our well being, also cuddles ain‚Äôt free. It would essentially reinforce to her that it‚Äôs okay to not prioritize our dates and it‚Äôs okay to not respect my time.

The next morning she is reading the bible and journaling, I see her stuff a note in my lunchbox (yes I have a lunch box, fuck you). Our son gets up and I‚Äôm engaging with him and we‚Äôre having fun. Finally she comes over to me, looks at me, I pull her hips into me and she hugs me and starts crying. I do not say a word. At this point she just needs to feel my masculine strength and energy, she needs to FEEL I‚Äôm the rock and that I‚Äôm not going to be persuaded or pushed, that I‚Äôm going to lead her and hold her accountable. I pick her up and take her to the couch and hold her on top of me while she cries. My son comes and hugs on her and tells her not to cry. She sits up and through tears tells me she doesn‚Äôt want to disappoint me so I pick her up, carry her up stairs, lay her in our bed and embrace her. For a solid 5 minutes she just lays her head on my chest.

I then get up lock the door, come back to bed and undress her; she starts to grin through the tears, I look her in the eye and tell her ‚Äúyou understand that all I was asking for was for you to give me you.‚Äù We have a good session; as wet as ever and then I held her afterwards. The rest of the day she has been bouncing around and smiley, called and texted 4x. Came by my office, sent me memes, etc.

For me this was a big leap in calling out shitty behavior, holding frame, not comforting bullshit while comforting her when warranted, and giving her validation sex that she needed. It‚Äôs my job to lead us much as a Parent would lead the oldest teenager in the house. I used to think that term was somewhat demeaning but now I see it for what it is: it‚Äôs to describe someone youthful in their thinking, desire for fun, their need for someone to lead them, someone to call them out when they make mistakes, someone to be the steady oak when they are emotional. Over the course of our marriage I had slid to being a doormat and doing whatever to appease her and ""make her happy"", even if it was dumbass misguided bullshit. You wouldn't ask your teenager for financial advice would you?

As for the note she put in my lunchbox:

Ambitious Buddy,

I know it's only words and you are right as much as it pains me. All I can say is I'm sorry and do better. You are my favorite person in the whole world. I'm going to do better and I will do better. I'm sorry.

Love,

Says that they figure them cancelling is good because I get a day off (it‚Äôs not, I lose a days pay every time), acts confused when I can‚Äôt change my schedule to suit their new ones. I give each client a small card and gift, client A didn‚Äôt even acknowledge it, not even a thank you. Blatantly treats me like the help and doesn‚Äôt tip (which is never expected but people typically do, even something small around the holidays). 


Client B: super nice and personable, always chats with me and offers me coffee, goes out of their way to make my job easier, not harder, never cancels. A genuinely awesome person to me and everyone she knows, sent me home with a bag of baked goods, a card and a tip for the holidays. 


I had client A yesterday and felt dejected, it was a tough clean on top of their behavior, house is wicked dusty and they were in my way the entire time which is a headache. But after client B I feel so much happier, it‚Äôs not tips or baked goods but being around someone who is so genuinely nice and I can tell actually cares about me, I‚Äôm so lucky to have people like that! I‚Äôm grateful for all of my clients of course but certain ones really brighten my day ",8,1733422484.0,housekeeping,6,0.91,False

Dr. Lena Vega, a neurobiologist with a knack for unconventional problem-solving, spends her days in a high-security lab funded by the enigmatic Horizon Initiative. Their latest project, NOVA, is a serum designed to heal neurodegenerative diseases by accelerating neural regeneration. Lena, driven by her sister Amara's declining health, works tirelessly despite constant resistance from her peers and the project‚Äôs shadowy sponsors.

One evening, Amara‚Äôs condition takes a sudden turn for the worse. Lena begs her superiors to expedite human trials, but they deny her, fearing the serum‚Äôs potential risks. Faced with no alternative, Lena sneaks the serum into her private lab and injects herself, hoping to push her mental limits and solve the serum‚Äôs lingering issues.

At first, nothing happens. Hours pass without any sign of improvement. Lena returns to her sister‚Äôs bedside, resigned to failure, only to collapse as a blinding migraine grips her. When she wakes, everything is different. Colors seem to vibrate, sounds overlap, and time feels malleable. Lena realizes she can see patterns in energy and molecules‚Äîa glimpse into the universe's underlying structure.


---

Chapter 2: Awakening

Lena‚Äôs newfound abilities begin as subtle enhancements: solving complex equations effortlessly, reading people's thoughts through microexpressions, and recalling obscure information with photographic precision. But the changes soon escalate. She accidentally lifts a pen with her mind, rearranges molecules in her coffee, and sees faint trails of energy connecting every living thing.

Meanwhile, her colleagues notice her transformation. Dr. Elias Kaine, her mentor, grows suspicious as Lena‚Äôs performance surpasses anything humanly possible. Lena, still grappling with her powers, isolates herself to avoid detection.

During one sleepless night, Lena creates a crude molecular simulation of her sister‚Äôs damaged neurons and ""reprograms"" their structure, effectively curing Amara in her private lab. Amara awakens, confused but healthy. However, Lena's joy is short-lived; she realizes the serum has tied her biology to a vast, cosmic force she cannot yet comprehend.


---

Chapter 3: The Hunt

Word of Lena‚Äôs miraculous transformation reaches the Horizon Initiative. They dispatch a covert team to capture her, suspecting she has unlocked the serum‚Äôs full potential. Lena narrowly escapes, using her ability to manipulate energy fields to evade advanced tracking drones and armed operatives.

Lena seeks refuge with Amara, who is both awed and terrified by her sister‚Äôs growing detachment from reality. Lena begins to experience visions of a place beyond space-time, a nexus where all dimensions converge. Through these visions, she learns that her transformation is incomplete‚Äîher powers are still growing, and with them comes a dangerous instability.

Dr. Kaine, who secretly orchestrates the Horizon Initiative‚Äôs darker agendas, reveals to his team that Lena‚Äôs connection to the Singularity Nexus could allow them to rewrite reality itself. He accelerates their pursuit, creating an energy-nullifying weapon to contain her.


---

Chapter 4: A New Reality

Lena's powers reach their zenith as she fully integrates with the Singularity Nexus. Her perception of time collapses, allowing her to see past and future simultaneously. She struggles to remain anchored to her humanity as memories of her childhood and her bond with Amara fade under the weight of her cosmic awareness.

In a desperate bid to stop Kaine, Lena infiltrates Horizon‚Äôs main facility, only to find they‚Äôve built a device capable of destabilizing the Singularity Nexus. Kaine plans to use it to reshape the universe in his image, regardless of the catastrophic consequences.

The confrontation culminates in a surreal battle where Lena bends time and space to her will. She stops bullets mid-air, rewrites the molecular structure of walls, and splits herself into multiple projections to overwhelm Kaine‚Äôs forces. Kaine, armed with the energy-nullifying weapon, briefly subdues Lena, forcing her to confront her mortality. However, her connection to the Singularity Nexus revives her, and she turns the weapon‚Äôs energy against Kaine, disintegrating him.


---

Chapter 5: Sacrifice

Lena discovers that the Nexus, now destabilized, threatens to collapse and consume the universe. With no other choice, she uses her remaining humanity to sever the Nexus‚Äôs connection to Earth. This act permanently transforms her into a being of pure energy, untethered from physical form but forever connected to the universe.

Before ascending, Lena creates a self-sustaining energy core from her essence, leaving it as a gift for humanity‚Äîa limitless power source capable of solving the global energy crisis. She cures Amara completely and shares a final, tearful goodbye.


---

Epilogue: Legacy

Amara becomes a leading scientist, dedicating her life to continuing Lena‚Äôs work. The energy core revolutionizes the world, ending wars fought over resources and ushering in a new era of technological progress.

Years later, Amara reflects on her sister‚Äôs sacrifice. One night, while stargazing, she sees a faint glowing nebula shaped like Lena, a cosmic reminder that her sister still exists, protecting the universe from the shadows. Amara smiles, knowing Lena‚Äôs legacy will live on‚Äînot just in the stars but in every life her sacrifice has touched.
