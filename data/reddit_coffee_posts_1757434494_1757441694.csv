a photograph of a cozy and inviting caf√© corner brimming with lush greenery and warm, earthy tones. The scene is dominated by an array of plants cascading from wooden planters affixed to the ceiling creating a verdant canopy that adds a sense of freshness and tranquility to the space. Below this natural display sits a counter adorned with hexagonal terracotta tiles that lend a rustic charm to the setting. On the counter various caf√© essentials are neatly arranged including a sleek black coffee grinder a gleaming espresso machine and stacks of cups ready for use. A sign reading ""SELF SERVICE"" in bold letters stands prominently on the counter indicating where customers can help themselves. To the left of the frame a glass display cabinet illuminated from within showcases an assortment of mugs and other ceramic items adding a touch of homeliness to the environment. In front of the counter several potted plants including Monstera deliciosa with their distinctive perforated leaves rest on small stools contributing to the overall green ambiance. The walls behind the counter are lined with shelves holding jars glasses and other supplies necessary for running a caf√©. The lighting in the space is soft and warm emanating from a hanging pendant light that casts a gentle glow over the entire area. The floor appears to be made of dark wood complementing the earthy tones of the tiles and plants. There are no people visible in the image but the setup suggests a well-organized and welcoming caf√© environment designed to provide a comfortable spot for patrons to enjoy their beverages. The photograph captures the essence of a modern yet rustic caf√© with its blend of natural elements and functional design. The camera used to capture this image seems to have been a professional DSLR or mirrorless model equipped with a standard lens capable of rendering fine details and vibrant colors. The composition of the photograph emphasizes the harmonious interplay between the plants the caf√© equipment and the architectural elements creating a visually appealing and serene atmosphere.

1ncq97f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1ncq97f/should_the_best_laundry_detergent_pods_be_tide/,Should the best laundry detergent pods be Tide PODS for you,"Tide 80367594 PODS have completely transformed my laundry game. I used to wrestle with measuring out liquid detergents, dealing with spills, and wondering if I added the right amount. These pre-measured pods are an absolute game-changer for anyone looking to simplify their laundry process while still achieving incredible cleaning results. The 3-in-1 formula‚Äîstain remover, odor fighter, and color protector‚Äîhad me intrigued right away. After a month of testing, I‚Äôm glad to say that these pods live up to their promise of making your clothes look and feel clean.

**Simple and Efficient Design**  
One of the best things about these detergent pods is their simplicity. The compact and biodegradable design makes them incredibly easy to use. You simply toss one pod into the washing machine before adding clothes, and it‚Äôs ready to go. Forget lugging around a heavy bottle of liquid detergent or scooping powder‚Äîthese pods are perfect whether you‚Äôre tackling small loads or larger ones by adding an extra pod. I even tested them in cold water, and they dissolved flawlessly every single time; no residue left behind.

**Good Aspects**
- All-in-one formula eliminates the need for extra products like stain removers.
- Pods are pre-measured, saving time and reducing waste.
- Works equally well in hot or cold water.
- The compact packaging fits neatly in smaller laundry spaces.

[Check Tide 80367594 PODS price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0bjmv9bxj/)  

**Performance That Delivers**  
Tide claims these pods have three times the cleaning power compared to bargain brands, and my experience confirms it. I‚Äôve got two kids who seem to attract grass stains like it‚Äôs their job. One wash with these pods completely tackled the problem. Grease from cooking? Gone. Coffee spills on a white shirt? Not a trace. Pair that with the ability to combat odors, and it‚Äôs safe to say that my laundry hasn't smelled this fresh in years. The Spring Meadow scent is a lovely, subtle burst of freshness‚Äînot overly perfumed, just clean and pleasant.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The packaging requires extra care, as the pods must be kept away from kids and pets.  
- Not ideal for super budget-conscious buyers compared to no-frill alternatives.  
- People with highly sensitive skin might need to test first due to the fragrance.  

**Versatility and Usability**  
Being compatible with both High-Efficiency (HE) and standard machines makes Tide PODS universally convenient. I tested them across different washer settings, from quick washes to heavy-duty cycles, and the results were equally impressive. Their quick-dissolving nature in cold water amazed me. Given that many people prefer cold-water washing for energy efficiency, this is a huge added bonus. For larger or heavily soiled loads, adding an extra pod is straightforward, simplifying laundry for people who run big households.  

**Rival Brands**  
When compared to other competing detergent brands, Tide PODS stand out in both efficiency and convenience. Products like Persil ProClean tablets and Arm & Hammer‚Äôs pods offer decent alternatives, but I‚Äôve noticed that they sometimes struggle with greasy stains or leave residues in cold water washes. The superior dissolvability and targeted stain-fighting formula of this detergent put it ahead of its market rivals. That said, some competitors do edge out Tide in scent profiles, particularly if you prefer unscented or natural options.  

**Affordable Quality**  
While these pods might feel a bit pricier compared to generic or traditional detergent options, their efficiency balances it out. Since they pack three functions‚Äîcleaning, color protection, and odor removal‚Äîinto one product, there‚Äôs no need to buy separate stain removers or fabric refreshers. For someone like me, who wants effective cleaning without mixing and matching multiple products, the value proposition makes sense. Plus, the time savings and overall cleanliness it delivers justify the cost in my eyes.

¬†  
That one corner with the discounted bread is probably where you linger, because I never go there. I avoided it at first. Not just because you would rush to check for deals. Rather, because of those little boxed coffees next to the bread racks The ones we splurge on if we had some extra cash.  
Then we broke up once and when we got back together, they were gone.  
Felt like a glitch in a video game, where we used an exploit to get something but it broke the game world. They disappeared with us, except the universe couldn't afford to rescue those too.

Coffee was such a huge part of our lives it seems. From purchase to sip. Every step between is brewed with your memories.  
Everything about this boring little drink reminds me of you.  
¬†So thanks, you kept me tired with hurricane arguments through the night resulting in tired days at work. And I still have tired mornings because I can no longer enjoy caffeine.

¬†Though I now appreciate the dull ache of a sleepy start to the day. Its an addicts trigger. I make my coffee, and remember you through every step. I laugh as I wipe away the grounds you would have left, and feel regret for even mentioning them. Then when I take a sip, I feel an unjustified anger explode out of me in every direction. I didn‚Äôt just loose a part of myself when we broke up. I can‚Äôt even make a decent cup of coffee to survive the mornings now.

Lizard brains flooding with every warning chemical possible, because it can't reconcile and believes something is off.  
To an outsider, I‚Äôm sure we really were something to witness.  
A party in box. Drop us anywhere and let us work the room like ruthless assassins of monotony.  
Truly a shame that alone we fell apart. Like having beans and no grinder.

Another thing is that the room is quite small and has studio layout with a kitchen (added in last photo), so I am not sure about adding more large furniture like coffee table/bookshelf (where would that even go), since the kitchen already has a large dinning table.

It‚Äôs rare I encounter a case so disruptive to my sanity that remedies outside the standard three amigos- alcohol, tobacco, and driving after both- fall short, and a more conscious outlet is required. So rare that it hasn‚Äôt been necessary until now. The case I‚Äôve been confronted with for the past couple of months has inspired feelings I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt shouldered since I was a rookie; the balancing on the edge of disillusion and vomit, the thermostat being dialed up in my body, the utter dread.

I suppose I‚Äôve exhausted any material to stall with. God, deliver me.

You‚Äôd have to be God‚Äôs favorite soldier to find an ounce of sugar or creamer in the same block as the coffee that swam in that yellowed glass pot. You drank it black or didn‚Äôt drink it at all.

It took me 3 years as a detective for the drowning cat of a city that is Seattle to manage drinking a whole cup of the coffee and 10 before I gave up on trying to cover up the distinct jet fuel taste.

As was typical, the weather outside was grey. The sky had begun weeping early the night before and showed no signs of getting a hold of itself anytime soon. I relish the memory of those few moments before the rain let up and Sargent Solomon, clutching his belt, peeked in to say: ‚ÄúGabe, mount up. Triple Homicide. Pier 55, follow the lead unit.‚Äù He tapped on the doorframe then left toward the elevator. 

It‚Äôs akin to having a noose tied around your neck and a bag on your head while you walk down a staircase that after one step or another just drops off. By setting the mug down and pulling on my coat, I had started walking down.

‚ÄúChrist on a stick. Who woke up with piss in their chalice?‚Äù 3 victims. 1 man, 1 woman, and 1 unlucky lamb. The Pier itself was walled in by million-ton tanker ships; these walls plus a radical amount of accidental and purposeful deaths along the Pier had been rewarded with the title: The Valley Of Death. Though the sky lacked its tears, the sea still crashed and broke against the walls of the docks.

The man‚Äôs testicals were sheared off at the stump and placed above the dismembered roots of a tree. The left and right cheek of his face were peeled part of the way off and lifted back to form horns. Adding to the silhouette, his ribcage was split and pulled back in blood eagle- blood angel- wings. ‚ÄúAdam Appelbaum, 33.‚Äù

‚ÄúBit on the nose.‚Äù I replied, sipping a Red Bull from the cooler in my cruiser.

‚ÄúCareful, too many of those you‚Äôll end up like little-angel there.‚Äù Chief Temple, gruffed as he tucked his hat into the crook of his armpit. 

‚ÄúHa fucking ha. Welcome to the ritualistic murder.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything better than home.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat? Wife got you on the couch?‚Äù

‚ÄúWife‚Äôs at her sister‚Äôs, and probably not coming back.‚Äù I frowned then awkwardly turned back to the corpse. 

The woman had suffered a hysterectomy and provided in the art piece was a jar of black: ‚Äú*Period blood.* Crazies provide labels now?‚Äù The jar had a strip of masking tape along it with its contents labeled.

The lamb was the least disgraced. Bolt to the head, laid to draining out on a white sheet below the two mutilated. Laid out ceremonially around them was an inverted pentagram. ‚ÄúAt least they‚Äôre loyal. Love their symbols. Assessment?‚Äù

All three victims shared 72 small tally cuts into their backs and one large stab wound in the nape of the neck. All three bodies were stiff and ice cold, yet the distinct stench of death was low-hanging and ferocious. All three bodies looked at some state of elevated peace and contentment. It was far clearer on the humans, for obvious reasons, but it would be a feat of criminal oversight to not notice it on the lamb‚Äôs.

‚ÄúWell might be a stretch to say ritualistic, but I could make a case for it.‚Äù Cops are easy to make laugh ‚Äòcause they‚Äôre hard to make squirm. ‚ÄúMight not be an apple but his cherries are overtop the roots. God‚Äôs curse to women in a jar. Why a lamb and not a snake? Not much clue, your homework is genesis, read up, and answer that for me. The man, Adam, is mocked up as the devilish figure‚Ä¶ purpose? Lost as a camel in the sewer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a start. Bag all this up if you‚Äôd kindly, if rain rolls back in before forensics get here they‚Äôll throw a bitch-fit.‚Äù

‚ÄúLoud and clear.‚Äù

I bagged the roots. Then, the jar. Then, lastly and begrudgingly, the cherries.

Knew. I knew what was waiting for me in the water. Parker looked at me like I was insane as I climbed down the ladder to the side of the Pier. The crashing waves speared 20 feet past the walls of the dock routinely and; just in the time from reaching the Pier; I had seen spurts as high as 50. The ladder itself was more rust than metal and was slightly concave from the beating waves. Any good mind wouldn‚Äôt trust the ladder as far as they could throw one of the tankers, but I haven‚Äôt a good mind and maybe that‚Äôs why it held. Maybe that‚Äôs the waves slammed to either side of me, but not into me. 

My hand dipped into the bubbly water, past the wrist. As I gripped the knife sitting contently and still in the sloshing waters, I knew it impossible for a metal blade such as this to sit even 100 meters from the surface- let alone a measly 4 inches below the stirring surface.

‚ÄúI got a weapon here!‚Äù

‚ÄúGuard- my cherubim- the gate to the garden, and the flaming sword I have set here. And as for you!‚Äù The snake shivered. ‚ÄúI know your true shape. But for this grievous infraction, I shall only curse the one you take now. You shall be doomed to slither along the ground from now till extinction. Your image will not be that of just another reptile, but the ultimate iconography of sin. Why any entity, let alone one of my kin, thinks it has the power to work beyond my peripheral disgusts me. I am the Law and nothing exists beyond me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll things but me‚Ä¶ Remain in the eye of God?‚Äù I spoke in a shuddering translation.

‚ÄúSince when did you learn latin?‚Äù Temple asked.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt even know it was latin.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery funny. Toss it.‚Äù This pulled me from my gridlocked stupor.

‚ÄúWhat? Why? It‚Äôs a possible murder weapon?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's a shitty little knife you found floating on the water? Ya hear of many real knives floating? Probably some toy one of these micks pulled out of a container during the unloading. Toss it, ‚Äòless you want forensics trying to find out what Taiwanese factory it was molded in.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt on the surface‚Ä¶‚Äù I grumbled but trailed off before I finished the thought. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He barked.

‚ÄúTossing it.‚Äù I chimed, then bagged it the moment he turned his back. ‚ÄúTake that to Hildi,‚Äù (Our beloved forensic examiner.) ‚ÄúAnd get it checked against the stab wounds. I may not be a tech, but fuck me if that ain‚Äôt a match.‚Äù I muttered to Parker and passed the bagged blade from my chest to the lining of his overcoat. 

‚ÄúHow did yo- alright.‚Äù He pushed his hand into his pocket and moved the jowls of the coat to consume the bag.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI trust your judgement more than anyone's.‚Äù It‚Äôs not wrong to say I‚Äôm old- it's hurtful- but not wrong. Of the 246 concurrent officers and agents working out of the Seattle Department, I was the only one remaining from the pre-2000s. Behind me were a couple blueshirts, and behind them was the captain. But even still, the most senior blueshirt was still 4 years my junior. I‚Äôve been here a long time, not entirely a good time. 

‚ÄúCap, I‚Äôm gonna do a run of questioning, see if I can get any statements from the Pier crew.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, keep it quick, techs are almost here. I‚Äôm leaving, it‚Äôs colder than a witch‚Äôs tit in a brass bra out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdious, I expect dinner when I get home. Help your mother set the table.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSomebody‚Äôs a fuckin‚Äô comedian today.‚Äù He sneered as he dropped into his cruiser. ‚ÄúGreasy cun-.‚Äù and the door shut. I held the smile until he was out of sight.

‚ÄúWho crawled up his ass?‚Äù Parker asked.

‚ÄúGet that to Hildi, ASAP. I‚Äôm running statement duty.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhen are you clearing?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving with the techs.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit, good luck.‚Äù Parker patted me on the back and left shortly after.

‚ÄúNo sir, bodies were here when we got here.‚Äù The Irishmen- micks as Temple called them, only half kidding- said as he reset the grinder his partner was using to cut the locks on the recently docked containers.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt odd to you?‚Äù My pen hadn‚Äôt moved in about 30 people; every person questioned before this man had given me the same answer: ‚ÄúHere when we got here.‚Äù  

‚ÄúYou work here long enough, you see bodies wash up, you see people jump in and not come up, you see the occasional execution. It‚Äôs no free quickie (suprise) to see a couple a year. You get used to it as fucked as it is to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúAl- Alright.‚Äù I gave up, 52 people and I got nothing.. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off.‚Äù 

Marques raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow does someone dump bodies in the center of a Pier and no one notices, let alone not care?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell you heard him: Dumped here when they got here, they probably just saw the bodies, called it in, and moved on.‚Äù Marques was a stout black kid who had ridden a full ride academic scholarship from Highschool to Yale to Seattle as a forensics specialist. He was smart, book smart, and could be a damn fine detective but thought the field of forensics was more tailored to him. I tried to convince to go through the academy a number of times, but he never did and I doubt he ever will.

‚ÄúNot buying it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? That they didn‚Äôt see anything? Seems a little‚Ä¶ conspiratorial.‚Äù He worked a pair of metal rods, one with a mirror on the end, searching through the mouths of the victims.

‚ÄúNo no, not that. I know they didn‚Äôt see shit, which makes me more concerned.‚Äù Marques turned to me and raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not buying the bodies were here when they got here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would they not see bodies get dumped and a whole satanic mural set up?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would none of this wash away in the rain?‚Äù He was silent.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, shit as in I just found something, that‚Äôs a whole mic-drop too, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He fished for a long pair of forceps, wormed the instrument to back the male victim‚Äôs mouth, and extracted a stinking bag. 

Inside was: ‚ÄúApple seeds, and- god it stinks- teeth‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre dentist adjacent; what kind of teeth are those?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThose are‚Ä¶ wisdom teeth, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused then dove back into the mouth of the victims. ‚ÄúHow many teeth?‚Äù

‚Äú16.‚Äù

‚ÄúBad news, good news, which do you want first?‚Äù

‚ÄúBad.‚Äù

‚ÄúBad news, none of the vics here are missing teeth. Good news, they have great teeth.‚Äù He chuckled slightly and I exhaled something akin to a chuff. 

‚ÄúSo we got what? 8 more victims, at least?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat or we‚Äôre looking for a very religious dentist.‚Äù

The drive home even 2 weeks later was odd. Low laying dread churred in the tires of my 2011 ford shitbox. A series of infractions upon the natural way of the world had induced some clinical uprooting. An algorithmic breakdown and reconstruction that had targeted the organized logic I had labeled and drawered and boxed so meticulously. The table laid like this: 3 dead; 1 male, 1 female, 1 lamb; with a pocketed 8 in the possession of whoever committed this crime.

The words had left my own lips, repeating what I had been told, instants before convulsing and sending my car off the road. It came to a rest in the ditch. Nothing was broken other than my right mirror, but much more had been displaced. Voices don‚Äôt come from the sky, they murmur to you in the corners of your mind, in the corners you thought only your mind can whisper to itself. 

My breath bubbled in my throat and slowly gained the confidence to be exhaled out into the frightening world. ‚ÄúBecause the form was cursed.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt take long for me to forget about the crash and start back on the road, coasting 20 over. The brakes squealed as I docked it and the lights flashed rapidly as I leapt out and ran for the nearest bible. The bookstore would closed, but the library closest to my house was 24/7. I bolted in, scanned my library card and pulled a Bible off the shelf.

My knowledge of the Bible was limited, I had gone through some indoctrinatorial Sunday School sessions as a teen after my mom died and my dad found Christ. It never stuck with me but I never discredited it, it was a theory of the world and I‚Äôd be a shitty detective to turn down a theory. I gave God his merits as a stand up guy who I was confident would be fun to have a beer with, but in the same way I thought superman would be. Fictional until proven real. But now my nose was 6 feet deep into the Bible and my brain was 5 cups deep into self-serve coffee provided in the cafe. 

I checked out the Bible around 4 am and drove home in a hope to scavenge the 3 hours I had till work began for something akin to sleep. I found it in the driveway, having parked my car and not even reaching the handle.

Now, I am finding it some of the best, most unique and visceral TV I have ever watched, however; some episodes, you know the ones (Atomic Bomb, Traffic Jam, ‚ÄúHello Johnny‚Äù etc), really have affected me where I‚Äôve had borderline panic attacks.

I‚Äôm just wandering if anyone else has had to space them out as I have? And furthermore, I may check in again in a month when Ive finished them all!

Lot traits: cursed, gremlins

Grabbed my spot at the empty table. Buy in $200. Rolled for a bit just to warm up then took a dinner break pretty early in.

Still empty table after dinner I was up and down just hitting a few numbers here and there.
Finally went on a good roll and it crapped out right at 6:53 so I had them hold the dice so I could run over to the Dunkin‚Äô Donuts inside the lobby because they close at 7 and I had to get a coffee or it would be another short night.

Coffee acquired I went from about $350 to under $100 in just a few shooters, those guys sucked at throwing dice (I‚Äôm the only one at the table üòî)

Another all in and I brought it back with a pretty decent roll, hit the littles bonus and a good amount of numbers. Went from about $32 for the 8,9,10 and 10 pass line back up to around 400. 
Finally had some more people join the table around 7:45 and more throughout the night. Had a full table for a bit around 9pm but it was choppy for a while and bankroll management killed off a lot of the players.

Some first timers joined in around 10 and we had a good few shooters. Bumped me up to around $750. 
Table suddenly got cold as ice. Trying to hang on I burned through some heavy bets on myself and another guy that was shooting decent. Too much pressing not enough collecting and I was down to about $600 before I left the table.

I don‚Äôt wanna talk about what happened at the roulette table.

Used some free play ($10) to run up some little bonuses. 10>40>60 next machine 60>110>260 and that‚Äôs enough flashing lights for me.

1ncpttm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1ncpttm/42m_france_i_have_been_totally_celibate_all_my/,42M France I have been totally celibate all my life I have traditional values I am seeking a serious relationship with a nice lady aged 25-32 please this is a long post I have been very open and honest about myself Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full,"

Hi  there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one! ",0,1757440248.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

**Why This Pick?**

I spend a lot of my time questioning the capabilities of both these offenses ‚Äì but with Mitchell Parker (6.68 ERA) and Adam Mazur (5.74 ERA) on the mound, I think both teams put at least 4 runs on the board here. In fact, I think it would take incredible levels of luck for this game not to see at least a total of 10. Parker is carrying a whopping 6.68 ERA on the road, while Mazur sports a 6.35 ERA at home. Comically, Parker‚Äôs last outing against the Marlins just last week saw a total of 15 runs ‚Äì Washington cashed the Over all by themselves while the Marlins scored 5.

1ncpqvr,https://i.redd.it/3r2b417mf6of1.jpeg,Marking my attendance for #TeamKhamrahQahwa,"Just a random review post of Khamrah Qahwa. If you have already tried it, please scroll past. Writing this down just because I just wanted one of my top 10 favourites to stay on my feed on DFA.




TLDR: Sweet boozy vanilla with tons of warm spices, cozy AF, performs great in cold weather - if you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, you definitely should.



Khamrah Qahwa is essentially a sequel to the OG khamrah. If you haven‚Äôt tried the OG, definitely try a decant. You may love it or hate it, but not trying at least one of the two is honestly an experience you would be missing out on.


The notes are all there on Fragrantica, but to my nose, Khamrah Qahwa is the beautiful cacophony of warm spices, vanilla, and what Lattafa claims to be a coffee note ( but it‚Äôs more of a guest appearance than a main character, I said what I said.) üòí


Once that spicy sweet opening fades, Khamrah Qahwa envelopes you in a cozy hug of syrupy, slightly boozy vanilla, warm musk, some tonka beans, and hints of coffee/chocolate that make sure you are not choking yourself, or others around you. It‚Äôs solely there to balance out the sweet notes, and it hits the spot rather perfectly.


Cozy is the story with this one. You may love it or trash it, but Qahwa is undeniably a compliment puller. We are so used to thinking of basic middle-eastern fragrances as dupes/clones (for good reasons), but Khamrah Qahwa is an OG. For its current price point of average 2200 to 2300 INR in 2025, it‚Äôs unbelievable how good this scent is.


Khamrah Qahwa wasn‚Äôt made for any other season than the winters. The OG Khamrah has a sparkling, syrupy sweet vibe to it that I find much more balanced out in Qahwa. It‚Äôs still sweet, not on a gourmand level. The OG Khamrah is also heavy on dates, that one note tones down more and more in the Qahwa, and then the Dukhan variant.



Both Khamrah and Khamrah Qahwa are fairly unisex. The Dukhan flanker is perhaps the most masculine out of the three, but the exact same drydowm as Qahwa.




Enough has been said about its performance, the main challenge is the scent profile. Try a decant and see for yourself :)",7,1757440069.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,8,1.0,False

I have had these skull-crushing, mind-erasing, brain-melting headaches for as long as I could remember.  My parents dragged me around to eye doctors and heart doctors and specialists etc etc etc and nothing seemed to do it.  After a while I just grew to live with it and coped. 

Into my adult life I started trying to selectively remove foods, or eliminate certain groups all together (I never drank or smoked), but nothing ever affected the headaches.  It was about 2 headaches per week with no particular trigger, but they would always be crippling and mostly migraines.

It was about few days after I discovered this sub that it finally clicked - I have been drinking coffee since I was 13.  Of all of the things that I have tried, I haven‚Äôt tried removing the one consistent, psychoactive drug that I have been taking my entire life.  I was only a 1 cup a dayer and upwards of 3 during college but I was extremely consistent. 

So, I go and stop coffee one day - I switch to 1 green tea.  The withdrawal symptoms are harsh but whatever. 3 weeks later and I haven‚Äôt had 1 headache (except for the obligatory withdrawal one).

¬† Academic Overture  
  
¬† The H√¥tel du Pimen√©, Gavarnie, takes its name from the great peak of the High Pyrenees in whose shadow, at early morning, it lies. Beyond the palisade of trees shading its front courtyard runs the road from Lourdes; behind the hotel and below it, in a gorge of the rock on which it is built, roars and tumbles the River Gave-de-Pau, on its way from the high corrie of the Cirque to the slow winding courses of the Low Pyrenees. The dining-room windows give on to this little gorge, so that anyone sitting at table may look straight down on to the damp slabs of the bridge that leads to the skirts of the Pic du Pimen√©.  
  
¬† At one of these windows, on a blazing fifth of July, sat Miss Jennifer Silver, aged twenty-two, eating an excellent lunch. This was not her first visit to France, and she was savouring that heady sense of rediscovery which that country wakes perpetually in her lovers. And the little dining-room, with its chattering cosmopolitan crowd, its exotic smell of good food and wine, and the staggering view from its windows, presented a cry quite astonishingly far from Oxford, which was Jennifer‚Äôs home ‚Ä¶ Perhaps, however, not such a very far cry after all; for, from the next table, where sat two middle-aged women, tweeded and brogued in defiance of the lovely Southern morning, came snatches of a conversation which smacked decidedly of the newer alchemy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòMy dear Miss Moon‚Äô ‚Äì a morsel of truite maison, exquisitely cooked, waved in admonition on the end of a fork ‚Äì ‚Äògravity separation of light and heavy constituents, as you know, is believed to be essential to the production of such banding. That shown by these particular rocks appears to be of the rhythmic type, the small-scale rhythmic type.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI quite agree with you, Miss Shell-Pratt.‚Äô Miss Moon dug into her trout with the dogged efficiency and artistic appreciation of a bull-dozer. ‚ÄòIndeed, as Steinbascher and Blitzstein have it in their admirable Einf√ºhrung in die Urspr√ºnge der Magmatiten durch Differenziationen, the troctolites ‚Ä¶‚Äô  
  
¬† But here the waitress, a pretty dark-haired Bordelaise without a word of English, brought the croquettes de ris de veau √† la Parmentier, the pommes de terre saut√©es, and the petits pois en beurre, and Jennifer, not unnaturally, missed the remainder of this fascinating exchange. She was making again the wonderful discovery that simple greed is one of the purest of human pleasures. The food on the journey had been pleasant and adequate, but little more; this, she thought, helping down the sweetbreads with a mouthful of topaz-coloured wine, was a sufficiently promising start to a holiday somewhat oddly conceived ‚Ä¶ She remembered Gillian‚Äôs letter in her pocket, and the slightest of frowns crossed her face. That could wait: she had resolutely refused to worry during the three days‚Äô journey from Oxford, and she was not going to begin now that she would soon be seeing Gillian herself.  
  
¬† But, all the same, as the meringue Chantilly succeeded the sweetbreads at her table, and the hypersthene gabbros succeeded the troctolites at the next, her mind began, in spite of herself, to turn over the events which had led up to her arrival this morning in the little Pyrenean hotel.  
  
¬† Jennifer, whose father was the Bullen Professor of Music at Oxford (his Sixty-eight Variations on the Fifth of the Thirty-three Variations by Beethoven on a Waltz by Diabelli was, you will remember, the sensation of the Edinburgh Festival of 1954), had lived most of her life at Cherry Close, the lovely old house whose high-walled garden backs on to St. Aldate‚Äôs, right under the bells of Christ Church. She was an only child, but any loneliness she might have felt came to an end when she was seven, for then her half-French cousin Gillian, who lived in Northumberland, came, on the sudden death of her parents in one of the first air raids of the war, to live with the Silvers. She was with them for almost six years, a welcome answer to Mrs. Silver‚Äôs problem of finding what she would have called ‚Äòa suitable companion‚Äô for Jennifer. At the end of the war Gillian married one Jacques Lamartine, who had been stationed with the Free French near Oxford, and soon after left England behind for the headier climate of Bordeaux, her husband‚Äôs home.  
  
¬† So Jennifer at thirteen was once more alone at Cherry Close. She attended, daily, a small expensive private school near her home, and was sent for a final year to an even more expensive finishing-school in Switzerland. This latter adventure beyond the walls was the only one which Mrs. Silver, with her unswerving devotion to the standards of a fading age, would have tolerated. One was ‚Äòfinished‚Äô, one came home, one was brought out, one was suitably married ‚Ä¶ this had always happened in Mrs. Silver‚Äôs world and she had never thought beyond it. If Jennifer herself had any ideas about her own future she never mentioned them. She had always been a quiet child, with a poised reserve that her mother mistook for shyness, and a habit of accepting life as it came, happily and with a characteristic serenity that Mrs. Silver (herself voluble and highly strung) found insipid. Mother and daughter got on very well indeed, with a deep affection founded on almost complete misunderstanding.  
  
¬† Professor Silver knew his daughter rather better. It was he who at length insisted (emerging briefly from a Bartokian abstraction to do so) that since she was coming home to live in Oxford she might as well pursue some form of study. Mrs. Silver, abandoning her delightful ‚Äì and, she knew, impossible ‚Äì dreams of Drawing-rooms, was brought finally to agree, finding some consolation in the fact that Jennifer chose to study Ar  
t rather than one of the more unwomanly of the sciences.  
  
¬† So Jennifer came home again to attend Art School and live at Cherry Close. It was not to be supposed that those high walls would be left long unstormed, for Jennifer at eighteen was growing very lovely indeed. She had been a plainish child, with the promise of beauty in the fine bones of the face, and the silken texture of the straight, pale-gold hair. Now the promise had been fulfilled, and Mrs. Silver anxiously girded herself for battle against the impecunious and ineligible hordes of students with whom Professor Silver thoughtlessly filled the house. But she need not have worried. Jennifer was as unconscious of ‚Äì or indifferent to ‚Äì their admiration as even her mother could have wished.  
  
¬† That is, until she met Stephen Masefield.  
  
¬† He had come up a little late, having already done his National Service, and having had the ill fortune to do part of it in Korea, where he had been wounded. It was a full year after his return to an English hospital before he was reckoned fit to take up the life so brutally interrupted. He was twenty-one, and full of a bitter sense of time wasted, and power perhaps atrophied with the laming of his body. He flung himself at his music as if it were a beloved enemy, and over his spasmodic, almost savage brilliance, Professor Silver alternately nodded and swore.  
  
¬† From the first Stephen monopolized Jennifer. There seemed to be nothing remotely lover-like about the relationship that Mrs. Silver watched with an anxious eye; Stephen seemed to have neither the time nor the energy to waste in love-making, and the idea did not appear to have entered Jennifer‚Äôs head. What none of them realized was that the serenity of Cherry Close, and the unruffled sweetness that was Jennifer‚Äôs main characteristic, were both acting on Stephen like powerful drugs. He himself, immersed in his all-other-excluding music, was only dimly conscious of his need for her; Mrs. Silver, her fears allayed both by her daughter‚Äôs silence and Stephen‚Äôs preoccupation, dreamed of a more eligible future and stopped worrying.  
  
¬† Until the night of the last Commem. Ball, when Mrs. Silver, hurrying down at the sound of the taxi ‚Äì it would never have occurred to her to give Jennifer a key ‚Äì opened the door upon a tableau that sent her heart down into her fur-trimmed slippers.  
  
¬† There was Jennifer, a lovely ghost in silver-white, with one foot on the bottom step, and her head turned back towards Stephen, whose hand was on her arm, detaining her. Mrs. Silver could not see Jennifer‚Äôs face, but she could see Stephen‚Äôs, and what she saw there made her open the door wide and gather her daughter with a pretty show of ceremony into the lighted safety of the hallway. Stephen, declining with rather less ceremony her invitation to come in and drink coffee √† trois, turned on his heel and walked away down the dark street.  
  
¬† Next day he was gone ‚Äì gone with a brilliant First in his pocket, off to Vienna for a further two years‚Äô study, while Mrs. Silver hurriedly re-planted the briars round her sleeping princess, and Cherry Close, emptied of Stephen‚Äôs disturbing presence, gradually sank back into its old bell-haunted peace. Two years ago ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Jennifer was brought sharply back to the present as the waitress whisked away her empty plate. At the next table, she could hear, the hypersthene gabbros had given way to the olivine gabbros, the orthopyroxene to olivine and clinopyroxene; at her own, the meringue Chantilly was replaced by grapes, peaches, and five kinds of cheese. Jennifer sighed, shook her head in genuine regret, and asked for coffee.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòHave it with me,‚Äô suggested a voice.  
  
¬† She looked up in surprise. A man who, from his table in a corner remote from hers, had been steadily watching her throughout the meal, had now risen and approached.  
  
¬† He was perhaps some twenty-six years old, tall and brown-haired, with a thin face and sensitive mouth. His eyes were of a vivid, long-lashed hazel. There was about his movements an odd loose-jointed abruptness that seemed to hint at some intense nervous drive within, but for all that he moved well, with a certain grace that his slight limp did nothing to mar. He was a singularly attractive young man; more than that, he looked like a man who would some day matter. There was nothing of success-hunting ruthlessness in his face; the impression was due to some expression in the brilliant hazel eyes which belied the gentleness of the mouth.  
  
¬† Jennifer‚Äôs eyes lifted, and widened on him, while a wave of colour ran up into her cheeks, and then receded, leaving her marble-pale.  
  
¬† She said, on a note of unbelief: ‚ÄòStephen!‚Äô  
  
¬† He smiled down at her, and pulled out a chair. ‚ÄòJenny ‚Ä¶ may I?‚Äô He held out his cigarette-case and if it was a trifle unsteady she was in no condition to notice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòBut ‚Äì Stephen! What in the wide world are you doing here?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòHolidaying. I‚Äôve been here for a few days already.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòBut ‚Äì here?‚Äô  
  
¬† He misunderstood her deliberately. ‚ÄòOh, not at this hotel. In Gavarnie. I‚Äôm lodging rather more humbly than this at the √âp√©e de Roland, but I sometimes eat here.‚Äô  
  
¬† She took a cigarette almost dazedly. ‚ÄòStephen, what an extraordinary coincidence!‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt it?‚Äô His tone was so smooth that she glanced at him warily, to see him watching her with amusement ‚Äì and something else ‚Äì in his eyes.  
  
¬† She said uncertainly: ‚ÄòWell, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòOf course it‚Äôs not. I thought it was time I saw you again, that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôve come straight from Oxford.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòDid Mother ‚Äì did they know you were coming here?‚Äô  
  
¬† A smile touched his mouth. ‚ÄòI made it fairly clear, I think.‚Äô  
  
¬† She said irrelevantly: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve changed.‚Äô  
  
¬† The smile deepened. ‚ÄòYou mean I‚Äôm not so easily frightened away as I was?‚Äô  
  
¬† Colour stained her cheeks again. ‚ÄòNo, of course not! How silly! But‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† He prompted her gently. ‚ÄòBut?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI did think you might have called to say good-bye that time,‚Äô she said, not looking at him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI did.‚Äô  
  
¬† Her eyes lifted. ‚ÄòDid you? When?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòFairly early, on the morning after the ball. Your mother said you were still in bed so I had to go without seeing you. I sent you good-bye. Weren‚Äôt you told?‚Äô  
  
¬† She shook her head without speaking, and at the bleak look that touched her face he felt anger lick through him again as it had done that morning two years ago, when he had gone impulsively back to Cherry Close, hoping for he didn‚Äôt quite know what. Perhaps a short half-hour with Jennifer before his train left ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† But it was Mrs. Silver who came to him in the big music room, and proceeded to explain exactly why it was undesirable for him to see Jennifer that morning ‚Äì or, in fact, ever again. She did it unanswerably, charmingly, cruelly ‚Ä¶ she dealt in the kindest possible way with his lack of means, uncertain prospects and, finally, with the undoubted instability of the musical temperament ‚Ä¶ Stephen was too unhappy and too angry to appreciate the delicacy with which this last was touched on by the Professor‚Äôs wife, with one hand resting gracefully on her husband‚Äôs big Steinway grand, and one eye, figuratively speaking, on his study door ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† There was no fighting back. There was too much truth in what she was saying, and besides, Stephen was not himself fully aware of what it was he wanted. He only knew that last night the realization that he would not see Jennifer again for two years had overwhelmed him like the wave of a bitter sea. The promised years in Vienna, till then a golden dream, presented themselves all at once as years of exile, years of drifting alone on the tossing waters of uncertainty, away from the still and quiet centre of his life. Jennifer ‚Ä¶ But if he was only just aware of his own feeling in the matter, he was miserably unsure of Jennifer‚Äôs. The revelation last night should have been a beginning; it had come, instead, at the end ‚Ä¶ So, because he had to ‚Äì and because he had a train to catch ‚Äì Stephen accepted the plain, killing common sense of what she said to him, went to Vienna, and wrote once a week to Jennifer ‚Äì long, sprawling, conversational letters, mostly about his work ‚Äì letters that an elder brother might have written, and that Mrs. Silver certainly might have read ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† By the end of the t  
wo years‚Äô exile there was no doubt whatsoever in Stephen‚Äôs mind as to what he wanted ‚Äì had to have, if he was ever to be whole and at peace again. It would have taken a dozen mother-dragons far better armed than Mrs. Silver to keep him from seeing Jennifer and making the beginning denied him two years before. But he did not even have to do battle; that had already been done by Professor Silver, to whom his wife, agitated by the news of Stephen‚Äôs coming, had appealed. Stephen, once again facing a parent in the big music room, found himself dazedly listening to Professor Silver talking about his prospects in an entirely different manner ‚Ä¶ There would be, it appeared, a vacancy which Professor Silver was pretty sure Stephen could fill ‚Ä¶ would see, in fact, that he did fill ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Stephen came to with a jerk, and said warily: ‚ÄòHere, sir?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòUndoubtedly.‚Äô Professor Silver‚Äôs eyes glinted. ‚ÄòThe other place,‚Äô he added, ‚Äòwould not be at all the kind of thing that Jennifer is used to.‚Äô  
  
¬† And Stephen, still in a daze, had eventually found himself out in the street, with the Gavarnie address in his pocket, and the Professor‚Äôs final injunctions ringing in his ears: ‚ÄòYou need a holiday, don‚Äôt you? What‚Äôs against going up there? Have you enough money? Good; well, good luck. She‚Äôs in London just now, with an aunt, but if I were you I‚Äôd get straight to Gavarnie and meet her there. You‚Äôll both of you stand a much better chance off the home pitch, as it were. But ‚Äì go carefully, my boy. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs quite the fragile little blossom her mother thinks she is, but don‚Äôt rush your fences.‚Äô  
  
¬† So here he was, sitting in silence, watching her averted profile, and painfully conscious of the two-years‚Äô gap that must be bridged, of all the things that must be said and that he must school himself not to say ‚Äì yet. And Jennifer, carefully studying the end of her cigarette, felt the silence drawing out between them, not the easy silence of companionship that used to be theirs, but a pause charged with some new and disturbing element that she did not understand. What had happened? Why had he looked angry? And ‚Äì why had he come? Her heart began to beat lightly and fast, but her face was shuttered, and she gave no sign. How could she, until he spoke more clearly? And Stephen, watching her, sensing some uncertainty in her, shut down even harder on his own hopes and desires.

¬†Impasse ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Then through the silence tramped the capably shod feet of Miss Shell-Pratt and Miss Moon, as they left their table and proceeded, still talking busily, towards the lounge.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòHow were they bedded?‚Äô Miss Moon‚Äôs eager query rang out almost directly above Stephen‚Äôs head as they passed his chair. ‚ÄòHorizontally or vertically?‚Äô  
  
¬† Miss Shell-Pratt was brusque. ‚ÄòVertically, Moon, vertically. And the bedding was much disturbed.‚Ä¶‚Äô  
  
¬† The dining-room door clashed behind them. Stephen had swung round and was staring after them, with a bemused expression that made Jennifer begin to laugh.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòWhat in the wide world was that about?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòGeology, Stephen, just geology! I‚Äôve been listening to it the whole of lunch-time. You can have no idea of the excitements of geology!‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòSo it would appear.‚Äô He got to his feet. ‚ÄòIt sounds an extraordinary science. I suppose they do it at Cambridge. Come on, Jenny, let‚Äôs get out of here; I want to stand you a liqueur.‚Äô  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† Prelude  
  
¬† The lounge was crowded, but they found two chairs in a cool corner, and Stephen ordered drinks. Around them the conversation surged in an exciting hubbub of languages and accents. Three Frenchmen just beside them were absorbed in a passionate discussion of a recent bank robbery in Bordeaux, a party which had visited the Cirque that morning was showing off to a party which was to visit it that afternoon, two Swiss climbers were comparing experiences with a French boy, while, still at Jennifer‚Äôs elbow, the troctolites were having it all their own way.  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Ä¶ Not been up to the Cirque yet? Then don‚Äôt hire a mule from the man with‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Äì A colourless amphibole‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Äì Who murdered the bank clerk. It was the Dupr√© gang all right. They got Marcel Dupr√©, but the woman ‚Äì his sister, wasn‚Äôt it? ‚Äì she got away‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Ä¶ I tell you the wretched mule tried to trot‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Äì Up a sheer face of four thousand feet‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Äì With a red-spotted troctolite‚Äî‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚Äò‚Äì But they‚Äôll catch her, you mark my words ‚Ä¶ unless she‚Äôs over the frontier already ‚Ä¶‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòThank God,‚Äô said Stephen at last. ‚ÄòHere come the drinks.‚Äô  
  
¬† The waiter, with a tray laden with drinks, was weaving his practised way between the tables, managing with the expertise of the French professional to waste no time whatever and yet appear to take a vital interest in the subjects dear to his clients‚Äô hearts. He threaded his way swiftly through the conversation, shedding the drinks as he went, with a technique that bespoke much practice in this kind of inverted potato-race ‚Ä¶ Pernod, messieurs? Yes, it was a disgrace, that robbery. The papers said one of the criminals had hanged himself in his cell. Tant mieux ‚Ä¶ Madame? Cinzano? Indeed yes, Paul Lescaut should keep his mule under better control. It was the grandmother of the devil, that one ‚Ä¶ Messieurs? Your Dubonnet ‚Äì a guide? The best was Pierre Bussac, but he was not often in the village; in fact, he had not been down with his mule since ‚Äì let me see, yes, it was the night of the bad storm, three weeks ago; but if monsieur wished to arrange for a guide there was Robert Vrillac ‚Ä¶ Mesdames? Vichy water ‚Ä¶ ah, yes, there were rocks hereabouts, no doubt; he had certainly been told so ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† He escaped with some relief to Stephen‚Äôs table, and set down the benedictines with the air of one who had brought the good news to Aix against considerable opposition. Benedictine, monsieur ‚Ä¶ merci, monsieur ‚Ä¶ and he hoped the pictures were going well? With an air of subdued triumph he slid away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòHow in the world did he know that?‚Äô demanded Stephen.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòWhat did he mean?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòOnly that I mess about with water-colours as a hobby. It‚Äôs rest and recruitment of the spirit, and what you‚Äôd probably call comic relief.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt! I might even admire them. I know all the right things to say. I never knew you sketched, Stephen!‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never dared to tell you, my dear. Well, I‚Äôll await your expert judgment. ‚Ä¶ And meanwhile, I gather, you‚Äôve come to see your cousin?‚Äô  
  
¬† She nodded, but a shadow touched her face, so that he said quickly: ‚ÄòWhat is it, Jenny? Is there something wrong?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòN-no. That is, yes, Stephen. I‚Äôm worried about her.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòWould you like to tell me?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòYes. You never met Gillian, did you? She married Jacques the year the war was over. He had something to do with the wine trade; they had a nice house in Bordeaux ‚Äì I once stayed with them there ‚Äì and they were very happy. Then a few years ago Jacques died, and as there were no children and Gil was on her own in Bordeaux we rather hoped she‚Äôd come back and make her home in England. She hadn‚Äôt been left very well off, either. But she wouldn‚Äôt come. She seemed to have some silly ideas about being a burden to us, or something. Later we heard she‚Äôd taken a job teaching English in a local convent school. Then, last spring, she was ill ‚Äì oh, not seriously; I gathered it was a kind of ‚Äôflu, not dangerous, but weakening and depressing. At any rate, she seemed to take a long time to get better. We wrote again and tried to persuade her to come to England ‚Äì she‚Äôd had to give up her job ‚Äì but she finally said she was coming up here, into the Pyrenees, to try and recuperate.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòHere? In Gavarnie?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòNot exactly. She‚Äôs staying at a convent in the next valley. It‚Äôs called the Convent of Notre-Dame-des-Orages, and it‚Äôs also an orphanage.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI‚Äôve seen it. It‚Äôs in a wild little valley a few miles from here.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòWell, that‚Äôs where she‚Äôs staying. She wrote to tell me all about this last month, and suggested that I might come up here for a holiday. I said I would, and then I got another letter from her.‚Äô  
  
¬† He was watching her. ‚ÄòAnd just what was wrong with that other letter?‚Äô  
  
¬† She said slowly: ‚ÄòShe told me she was glad I was coming because she very much wanted to talk to me, to discuss ‚Ä¶‚Äô Her voice tailed off, and she looked up at him, her eyes shadowed. ‚ÄòStephen, Gillian says she‚Äôs thinking of becoming a nun.‚Äô  
  
¬† She stared at him with a sort of horror, and in spite of himself, Stephen laughed. It was apparent that to Jennifer, aged twenty-two, a convent was about as normal a habitat as the palace of the Dalai Lama.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòWhat a hidebound Protestant conscience!‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòWhy shouldn‚Äôt she?‚Äô  
  
¬† Jennifer laughed too, a little ruefully. ‚ÄòI know. It‚Äôs silly of me. But, Stephen, that‚Äôs not all that I‚Äôm unhappy about. I‚Äôm beginning to think she must have been taken ill again, up at the convent. I told you she wrote to me again. It was the night before she left for Gavarnie. Look, here‚Äôs the letter ‚Ä¶‚Äô  
  
¬† She groped in her handbag and gave it to him.  
  
¬† It was dated June 12th ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI‚Äôm awfully glad you‚Äôre coming. I want very much to see you, and talk to you about this thing. By the time you get this I shall be at Notre-Dame-des-Orages, and, I hope, feeling a good deal better. I hope that up there I‚Äôll come a bit nearer to finding the answer ‚Ä¶ you know what I mean. I haven‚Äôt time now, and anyway I‚Äôm not clear enough in my own mind yet, but I‚Äôll try and write more to you about it when I get up to the convent. I‚Äôm beginning to look forward to the drive up. The old car‚Äôs still going strong, and we‚Äôve arranged to start early tomorrow ‚Ä¶ Try the H√¥tel du Pimen√©; I believe they do you very well there, and it‚Äôs reasonable. But I‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs at all possible for you to stay at the convent ‚Äì these places usually take guests, and it‚Äôll be pleasanter, as it‚Äôs some way from Gavarnie (and much cheaper too, I expect!). I‚Äôll let you know when I write ‚Ä¶‚Äô  
  
¬† Stephen looked up to find Jennifer‚Äôs eyes fixed on him with the same shade of anxiety in them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòBut she didn‚Äôt write to me again,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs three weeks ago, and I haven‚Äôt heard another word. I didn‚Äôt write back, because I was waiting to hear from her by every post. I don‚Äôt even know if she‚Äôs arrived.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòWell,‚Äô said Stephen reasonably, ‚ÄòI should stop worrying. Now you‚Äôre here, there‚Äôs an easy way of finding out.‚Äô  
  
¬† Jennif  
er finished her drink and got to her feet. ‚ÄòI know. I‚Äôm going up to see her now.‚Äô  
  
¬† She spoke with such determination that he looked at her quizzically. ‚ÄòTo prise her loose?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòOf course, if I can.‚Äô She met his look, and laughed. ‚ÄòWhy not?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòYou versus the Holy Roman Church? Why not indeed? What d‚Äôyou suppose the College of Cardinals would say?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòThey can say what they like,‚Äô said Jennifer calmly, picking up her handbag and making for the door. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm thinking of Gillian.‚Äô  
  
¬† Stephen, with a fleeting memory of Mrs. Silver, grinned and followed her.  
  
¬† They made their way through the little village and began to climb the hillside road that winds through the valley of the Gave d‚ÄôOssoue. Behind them the houses seemed to sink and dwindle into the sunny hollow, till the coloured roofs and the church spire and the little curved bridge appeared as a huddle of small bright toys at the end of a white ribbon of road.  
  
¬† It was a golden afternoon. The road lifted its length before them along the hillside, the valley unfolding itself in curve after curve. The road was, to begin with, narrowly enclosed, with steep green meadows falling sharply to the stream-bed on the right, to rise again beyond the water in sheer pastures where cattle grazed with slowly-tolling bells. The valley twisted towards the south, and before them the great barrier of dim-green peaks which barred it had, miraculously, parted, and now valley and road were cupped between pine-clothed slopes soaring, rich in sunlight, towards still more distant crests of blue that brushed the sky. And these, faint with distance, etched in with snow and shadow against the long fingers of cloud that clung to them were, unbelievably, but the first ridges of the greater barriers beyond.  
  
¬† It did not seem so very far to the Valley of the Storms. This ran from the south, a narrow green cleft springing from the Spanish range, and its icy rush of water, the Petit Gave, tumbled into the Gave d‚ÄôOssoue some three miles above Gavarnie.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòThere you are. That‚Äôs the Vall√©e des Orages,‚Äô said Stephen. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll see the convent as soon as you pass that bluff.‚Äô He looked down at her. ‚ÄòWould you rather go on by yourself now?‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòYes, please. And thank you, Stephen.‚Äô  
  
¬† ‚ÄòThe pleasure was mine,‚Äô he said formally, and smiled. ‚ÄòSee you tonight.‚Äô  
  
¬† She turned off the road into the track ‚Äì it was little more ‚Äì that climbed the smaller valley. She walked steadily, and soon, as she rounded a curve of the track, she saw, some distance ahead of her, set back against the mountain-side to the left, the high white walls of the convent. A small square tower jutted up to catch the sunlight, vividly white against a rampart of pines beyond, and, even as Jennifer glimpsed it and guessed its nature, she heard, floating out on the thyme-laden wind, the silver sound of a bell.  
  
¬† She tilted her head to listen, smiling, her whole being pierced, rinsed through, tingling with a keen delight. But presently the very beauty of that pure passionless note, insisting beat by beat upon the strangeness of the place, took her with a new sensation, part pleasure and part fear, and wholly dream-like. To her, suddenly, in that high haunt of bells and tumbling waters, the mission on which she was bound seemed to lose reality. With the remote white walls of the convent, backed against that single sharp wedge of pine-wood, Gillian could have no connection. Even to think of Gillian living in Bordeaux, a French-woman among the French, had been fantastic, while to imagine her here ‚Äì slim, blonde Gillian, with the Northumberland sky in her grey eyes ‚Äì to imagine her here, quiet and cloistered among the Sisters of Our Lady of the Storms, was just not possible. Gillian, shut away in this lonely valley, perhaps for ever ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Her steps faltered, and stopped. She found herself staring up at the distant convent walls as if they were a prison, an enchanted fortress to be stormed ‚Äì the Dark Tower itself, circled by its watching hills. And she had come alone to storm it, a stranger, a resented intruder ‚Ä¶ alone. Alone. The very word, in this wild valley, sounded colder, thinner, more forlorn.  
  
¬† A little shiver touched her, and was gone like the fleeting shadow of a bird‚Äôs wing. She found herself glancing round quickly, even apprehensively, an involuntary reaction that annoyed her even as she made it. The hills waited. The sun beat down steadily on the empty valley. There was no movement but the rush of the white water; no sound but the distant chiming of the bell and the thud of her own heart ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† The sound that had been steadily gaining on her senses through the rushing of the water was not, after all, the beating of her heart. It was a swift beat, accelerando, that thudded behind her, up the turf of the valley-track, bringing with it that faint crawling sense of excitement, that slow apprehensive prickling of the skin that is our inheritance from countless long-dead men to whom the sudden sound of galloping hoofs spelled danger.  
  
¬† The thudding grew, swelled, and burst into the open valley, as the three horses swept round the bend and came on at a gallop, manes flying, chestnut necks outstretched.  
  
¬† Jennifer stepped quickly off the path, but her care was unnecessary for, before the cavalcade reached the point where she had been, the leading horse, checked by his rider, swerved sharply and plunged from the track, down the steep meadow towards the stream. The two following horses, riderless, swung after him. She caught a flying glimpse of the rider, a youth of perhaps eighteen, with a supple, wiry young body, and a dark, Spanish-looking face. He sat easily in the saddle, the effortless response of his body to the horse‚Äôs movement conveying a sort of fierce pleasure in the great brute‚Äôs plunge down the slope. Near the bank she could see him take hold of its head to steady it, seeming, as he did so, almost to grow down into the body of the horse; the wild gallop checked, steadied, and the beast gathered itself at the stream‚Äôs edge and leaped the wide rush of water. The loose horses, saddleless, and with reins knotted high on their necks, took the jump after him, and the sunlight flowed and glanced from their bodies as they flew.  
  
¬† Boy and horses ‚Äì they were so beautiful that they made the eyes sting and the throat ache. It was like watching a faultless flight of shining arrows going into the gold ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Then, with a heave of quarters and a scramble of hoofs and a rattle of stones, they were gone round a far bluff of the bare mountain.  
  
¬† The bell had stopped. The dust swirled and fanned and began to settle.  
  
¬† A peasant lad had taken his horses home from the village hiring; that was all.  
  
¬† Jennifer shrugged off the mountain magic, and quickened her pace up the valley.  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† Demande et R√©ponse  
  
¬† The convent gate, set in the high, blind white wall, was of dark wood, with an arched top and heavy wrought hinges. Jennifer, having pulled the old-fashioned bell-pull, waited in the hot silence. A grasshopper, leaping across her shadow, spread parasol wings of palest powder-blue, and the tiny lizard that flicked across the baked stone seemed part of the same enchantment that hung around her in the stillness. The smell of the pine-woods beyond the far wall of the buildings was dark and aromatic, spell-binding too in the drifts of memory it cast across the clear air.  
  
¬† But the rosy-cheeked girl who at length opened the gate dispelled the last wisps of magic. She was, presumably, one of the orphans housed by the good sisters; she was very young, not more than fourteen, and her solid sturdy body was clad in a dusty-blue cotton smock. Her face shone round and country-fresh as an apple, and her bare legs were brown as a nut. She grinned shyly at Jennifer, her round blue eyes curious.  
  
¬† Jennifer spoke in French.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòMy name is Silver. Jennifer Silver. I believe I am expected: I have come to visit my cousin who is staying here ‚Äì Madame Lamartine.‚Äô  
  
¬† The effect of this simple gambit was unexpected. The smile vanished from the cheery apple-face as quickly as a shadow wipes a high-light from a pippin‚Äôs cheek. The child said nothing, but hugged herself a little nearer to the edge of the gate, very much as if she would have liked to shut it there and then.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòI hope,‚Äô went on Jennifer politely, ‚Äòthat I haven‚Äôt come at an inconvenient time? Am I allowed to come in?‚Äô  
  
  
¬† The girl, still staring round-eyed, opened her mouth as if to speak, then shut it again, and shuffled her rope-soled slippers in the dust.  
  
¬† Jennifer, a little taken aback, began again. ‚ÄòIf it‚Äôs convenient‚Äô ‚Äì then a thought struck her, and she asked ‚Äì ‚Äòyou are French, aren‚Äôt you, not Spanish?‚Äô  
  
¬† The girl nodded, hovering now, it appeared, on the edge of a nervous giggle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄòThen have the goodness,‚Äô said Jennifer firmly, unable to imagine why a tongue-tied child should be appointed door-keeper, ‚Äòto take me to someone in authority. Take me to the Mother Superior, please.‚Äô  
  
¬† At this, to her relief, the girl stood back and pulled the gate wider. But her eyes, still staring as if fascinated, held in them some element of uneasiness that Jennifer by no means liked. Under that childish china-blue brightness it was as if dismay lurked ‚Äì yes, and some obscure horror. Something, at any rate, that was not just mere shyness and fear of strangers; something that was beginning to communicate itself to Jennifer in the faintest premonitory prickling of the spine. Something, Jennifer told herself sharply, that was being dredged up out of the depths of the subconscious, where half a hundred romantic tales had contributed to feed the secular mind with a superstitious fear of the enclosing convent walls.

1ncph3q,https://i.redd.it/8s7qhnsod6of1.jpeg,Cafeteira Espresso Autom√°tica S√©rie 2200 vale a pena?,"A **Cafeteira Espresso Autom√°tica S√©rie 2200** promete entregar caf√© com qualidade profissional atrav√©s do sistema LatteGo inovador e moagem precisa de 12 n√≠veis com moinhos 100% cer√¢micos. O modelo Philips Walita EP2230/12 conta com sistema de espuma cicl√¥nica de microbolhas a 394m/s, constru√ß√£o sustent√°vel com mais de 95% de materiais reciclados e 2 anos de garantia.

Durante os testes, o caf√© espresso saiu consistente com aroma equilibrado e creme denso, gra√ßas ao sistema Aroma Extract que controla temperatura da √°gua entre 90¬∫C e 98¬∫C. O sistema LatteGo se destacou produzindo espuma densa e cremosa em cerca de 15 segundos, sendo f√°cil de limpar e muito silencioso. O display touchscreen facilita a opera√ß√£o e o menu My Coffee Choice permite personalizar intensidade, temperatura e volume em tr√™s configura√ß√µes diferentes.

O design moderno em preto fosco oferece sofistica√ß√£o e compacta√ß√£o adequada para bancadas. A ergonomia √© bem pensada, com bico ajust√°vel entre 85 e 145mm para diferentes x√≠caras, acesso frontal para remo√ß√£o da borra e display responsivo e intuitivo. Com consumo de 1500W, classe energ√©tica A e modo ECO, oferece efici√™ncia energ√©tica adequada, enquanto o filtro AquaClean prolonga a vida √∫til e reduz manuten√ß√µes necess√°rias.

1ncpgpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoingToSpain/comments/1ncpgpm/what_do_you_do_regarding_mineral_water_and_tap/,What do you do regarding mineral water and tap water,"Just moved to the south coast. The tap water from the municipality is safe here but tastes very bad. I come from a country that has drinkable mineral water straight from the tap so it has been a bit of an adjustment to have to buy water.

Once I week I grab two 5 liter water jugs from the supermercado. I put them in the fridge and fill a 1 liter glass water pitcher so that I can pour more easily. I use the water for direct drinking, for making powder shakes and setting coffee.

Any tips on how to streamline this setup? And how to reduce plastic waste? I have been thinking about getting the 8 liter water jugs but I'm not very muscular. Maybe I can get them delivered.",1,1757439448.0,GoingToSpain,9,1.0,False

¬† Jerald Reinhold sat at the kitchen table, while his mother‚Äôs never-ending list of criticisms and demands rolled over him in dark, swollen clouds.  
  
¬† Every fucking day, he thought, the same thing. Like it was his fault he‚Äôd lost his stupid, dead-end job. His fault his girlfriend‚Äîanother bitch who never shut up‚Äîkicked him out so he had to move back in with his whining, mouthy parents. His fault he‚Äôd dropped a few thousand in Vegas and had some credit card debt.  
  
¬† Jesus! His fault, his fault, his fault. The old bitch never cut him the smallest break.  
  
¬† Hadn‚Äôt he told her that he wouldn‚Äôt have lost his job if his prick of a supervisor hadn‚Äôt fired him? So he‚Äôd taken a few days off, who didn‚Äôt? So he‚Äôd been late a few times, who wasn‚Äôt?  
  
¬† Unless you were a work-droid like his idiot father.  
  
¬† But God, she made it such a big fucking deal. He‚Äôd hated the job anyway, and only took it because Lori badgered him into it, but he got all the blame.  
  
¬† He was twenty-six, for Christ‚Äôs sake, and deserved a hell of a lot better than working for chump change as a take-out delivery boy.  
  
¬† And Lori gives him the boot just because he‚Äôs out of work‚Äîtemporarily‚Äîand goes batshit on him because he lost a few bucks on a trip with some friends?  
  
¬† He could, and would, do a lot better than Lori wide-ass Nuccio. Bitch threatened to call the cops just because he gave her a few smacks. She deserved a lot more than a couple love taps, and he wished like hell he‚Äôd given her just what she deserved.  
  
¬† He deserved more than a room in his parents‚Äô apartment and his mother‚Äôs incessant hammering.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJerry, are you listening to me?‚Äù Barbara Reinhold fisted her hands on her hips.  
  
¬† Jerry lifted his gaze from the screen of his PPC where he was trying to relax with a game. He spared his skinny, flat-chested, know-it-all mother one smoldering glance.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow can I help it when you never shut up?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you talk to me? That‚Äôs how you show your gratitude for the roof over your head, the food we put in your belly?‚Äù She lifted a plate that held a slice of bread, a thin slice of fake turkey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm standing here making you a sandwich since you finally dragged yourself out of bed at noon, and you sass me? It‚Äôs no wonder Lori kicked you out. I‚Äôm telling you one thing, mister, you‚Äôre not getting a free ride here much longer. It‚Äôs been almost a month now, and you haven‚Äôt done diddly about finding a job.‚Äù  
  
¬† He thought: Shut the fuck up or I‚Äôll shut you up. But he didn‚Äôt say it. He wanted the sandwich.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre irresponsible, just like your father said, but I said, he‚Äôs our son, Carl, and we have to help him out. When are you going to help yourself, that‚Äôs what I want to know.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI told you I‚Äôd get a job. I‚Äôve got options. I‚Äôm considering my options.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour options.‚Äù She snorted, went back to building the sandwich. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone through four jobs this year. What options are you considering while you‚Äôre sitting here in the middle of the day in the ratty sweats you slept in? I told you they‚Äôre looking for a stock boy down at the market, but do you go and see about it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a freaking stock boy.‚Äù He was better than that. He was somebody. He‚Äôd be somebody if people gave him half a break. ‚ÄúGet off my back.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe we haven‚Äôt been on your back enough.‚Äù She layered a slice of bright orange cheese on top of the turkey, and her voice took on the soft, reasonable tone he hated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour father and I scrimped and saved so you could go to college, and you flunked out. You said how you wanted to train so you could learn how to develop those computer games you like so much, and we backed you on that, put the money to that. When that didn‚Äôt work, your dad got you a job at his office. He went to bat for you, Jerry, and you screwed around and mouthed off, and got fired.‚Äù  
  
¬† She picked a knife from the block to cut the sandwich. ‚ÄúThen you met Lori, and she was the sweetest thing. A smart girl, a hardworking girl from a real nice family. We had such high hopes there. She got you working as a busboy in the restaurant where she works, and she stuck with you when you lost that job. When you said how you could get a messenger job if you had a good bike, we made you a loan, but that didn‚Äôt last two months. And you never paid us back, Jerry. Now this last job‚Äôs gone, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of you throwing the past in my face, and acting like it was all my fault.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe past keeps repeating, Jerry, and seems to be getting worse.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her lips pressed together as she added a handful of the Onion Doodles he liked to the plate. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of work again, and you can‚Äôt afford a place of your own. You took the rent money and the tip money Lori had saved up and went off to Las Vegas with Dave and that no-account Joe.  
And you came back broke.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a damn lie.‚Äù He shoved to his feet. ‚ÄúIt was my money, and I‚Äôve got a right to take a break with my friends, to have some goddamn fun.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a sheen in her eyes‚Äînot of tears, not of anger, but of disappointment. It made him want to punch, punch, punch that sheen away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was the rent money, Jerry, and the money Lori saved up from her tips. She told me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to take her word over mine?‚Äù  
  
¬† On a sigh, she folded a napkin into a triangle as she had for him when he was a boy. Her dented heart came clearly through the sound, but all he heard was accusation.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou lie, Jerry, and you use people, and I‚Äôm worried we let you get away with it for too long. We keep giving you chances, and you keep throwing them away. Maybe some of that‚Äôs our fault, and maybe that‚Äôs part of the reason you think you can talk to me the way you are.‚Äù  
  
¬† She set the plate on the table, poured a glass of the coffee-flavored drink he liked. ‚ÄúYour father and I were hoping you‚Äôd find a job today, or at least go out and look, make a real effort. We talked about it after you went out with your friends again last night. After you took fifty dollars out of my emergency cash without asking.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù He gave her his best shocked and insulted look. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take anything from you. You‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm stealing now? Ma!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be the first time.‚Äù Her lips compressed when her voice wavered some, and she came back with the no-more-bullshit tone he knew drew a deep, hard line.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe talked it over, decided we had to take a stand, Jerry. We were going to tell you together when your father gets home, but I‚Äôll tell you now so you‚Äôll have that much more time. We‚Äôre giving you until the first of the month‚Äîthat‚Äôs the first of December, Jerry‚Äîto find work. If you don‚Äôt get a job, you can‚Äôt stay here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need some time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve given you a month, Jerry, and you haven‚Äôt done anything except go out at night and sleep half the day. You haven‚Äôt tried to get work. You‚Äôre a grown man, but you act like a kid, and a spoiled, ungrateful one. If you want more time, if you want us behind you, you eat your lunch, then you go out and look for a job. You go down to the market and get that stock boy job, and as long as you‚Äôre working and show us you‚Äôre trying, you can stay.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù He forced tears into his eyes, a usual no-fail. ‚ÄúLori dumped me. She was everything to me and she threw me over for some other guy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat other guy?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who the hell he is. She broke my heart, Ma. I need some time to get through it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou said she kicked you out because you lost your job.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was part of it, sure. That asshole at Americana had it in for me, from day one. But instead of taking my side, she flips me over because I can‚Äôt buy her stuff. Then she tells you all these lies about me, trying to turn my own mother against me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEat your lunch,‚Äù Barbara said, wearily. ‚ÄúThen get cleaned up, get dressed, and go down to the market. If you do that, Jerry, we‚Äôll give you more time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd if I don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll kick me out? You‚Äôll just boot me to the street like I‚Äôm nobody? My own parents.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt hurts us to do it, but it‚Äôs for your own good, Jerry. It‚Äôs time you learned to do what‚Äôs right.‚Äù  
  
¬† He stared at her, imagined her and his father plotting and planning against him. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre right.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe want you to find your place, Jerry. We want you to be a man.‚Äù  
  
¬† He nodded as he crossed to her. ‚ÄúTo find my place. To be a man. Okay.‚Äù He picked up the knife she‚Äôd used to cut his sandwich, shoved it into her belly.  
  
¬† Her eyes popped wide; her mouth fell open.  
  
¬† He hadn‚Äôt planned to do it, hadn‚Äôt given it more than an instant‚Äôs conscious thought. But God! It felt amazing. Better than sex. Better than a good, solid hit of Race. Better than anything he‚Äôd ever felt in his life.  
  
¬† He yanked the knife free. She stumbled back, throwing up her hands. She said, ‚ÄúJerry,‚Äù on a kind of gurgle.  
  
¬† And he jammed the blade into her again. He loved the sound it made. Going in, coming out. He loved the look of absolute shock on her face, and the way her hands slapped weakly at him as if something tickled.  
  
¬† So he did it again, then again, into her back when she tried to run. And again when she fell to the kitchen floor and flopped like a landed fish.  
  
¬† He did it long after she stopped moving at all.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow that was for my own good.‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked at his hands, covered with her blood, at the spreading pool of red on the floor, the wild spatters of it on the walls, the counter that reminded him of some of the crazy paintings at MOMA.  
  
¬† An artist, he mused. Maybe he should be an artist.  
  
¬† He set the knife on the table, then washed his hands, his arms, in the kitchen sink. Watched the red circle and drain.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd been right, he thought, about finding his place, about being a man. He‚Äôd found his place now, and knew exactly how to claim his manhood.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd take what he wanted, and anyone who screwed with him? They had to pay. He had to make them pay, because nothing else in his life had ever made him feel so good, so real, so happy.  
  
¬† He sat down, glanced at where his mother‚Äôs body lay sprawled, and thought he couldn‚Äôt wait until his father got home.  
  
¬† Then he ate his sandwich.  
  
¬† Lieutenant Eve Dallas strapped on her weapon harness. She‚Äôd had a short stack of waffles for breakfast‚Äîsomething that tended to put a smile on her face. Her husband, unquestionably the most gorgeous man ever created, enjoyed another cup of superior coffee in the sitting area of their bedroom. Their cat, who‚Äôd just been warned off the attempt to sneak onto the table, sat on the floor washing his fat flank.  
  
¬† It made a nice picture, she thought: Roarke, his mane of black hair loose around his wonderfully carved face, that beautiful mouth in a half smile, and his wild blue eyes on her. The dishes from their meal together on the table, and Galahad pretending he didn‚Äôt want his nose in the syrup added to the ‚Äúat-home and liking it‚Äù ambience.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou look pleased with yourself, Lieutenant.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased,‚Äù she said, and added that musical murmur of Ireland in Roarke‚Äôs voice to her list of morning enjoyments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a couple of days without a hot one so I‚Äôm nearly caught up on paperwork. The quick scan of the weather for today told me I won‚Äôt be freezing my ass off, and I‚Äôm heading out with a belly-load of waffles. It‚Äôs a good day, so far.‚Äù  
  
¬† She hooked a brown vest over her shirt‚Äîboth Roarke approved‚Äîthen sat to pull on her boots.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGenerally you‚Äôd prefer several hot ones over paperwork,‚Äù he pointed out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading into the holidays, end of year 2060. You start on that season, you get the wackies. And the nearer I am to finishing my year-end report, the better. The last couple of days have been a walk, so if I get a couple more like that, I‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôve done it.‚Äù Shooting her a look of pity, he shook his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve jinxed any chance you had.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIrish superstition.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCommon sense. But speaking of Irish and holidays, the family‚Äôs coming in on Wednesday.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWednesday?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,‚Äù he reminded her. ‚ÄúSome of the cousins are switching off so those who couldn‚Äôt come last year will. You said you were fine with it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am. No, really, I am. I like your family.‚Äù He‚Äôd only recently found them. He‚Äôd lived most of his life, as she had, without blood kin‚Äîand the comfort or problems family bring. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just never sure what to do with so many people in the house who aren‚Äôt cops.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be busy enough. Apparently there are many plans in the works for shopping, sightseeing, theater, and so on. You‚Äôre unlikely to have all of them at once except on Thanksgiving itself. And then there‚Äôll be all the others.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah  
.‚Äù She‚Äôd agreed to that, too‚Äîand it had seemed like a fine idea at the time. All the people who‚Äôd come for dinner the previous year, in addition to her partner, Peabody, and Peabody‚Äôs main man, McNab, who‚Äôd opted not to travel this year.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt worked okay before.‚Äù Shrugging, she got to her feet. ‚ÄúWhat is it‚Äîthe more the crazier?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs merrier, but either way. And with that in mind, I‚Äôd like to add four more.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFour more what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGuests. Richard DeBlass and family. Elizabeth contacted me just yesterday. He and Elizabeth are bringing the children into New York for the parade.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTalk about crazy. Who wants to jump into that crowd?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThousands, or it wouldn‚Äôt be a crowd, would it? They‚Äôve booked a hotel suite along the route. I thought it would be nice to invite them to share Thanksgiving dinner. Nixie, especially, wants to see you.‚Äù  
  
¬† Eve thought of the girl, the lone survivor when her family had been slaughtered in a home invasion. ‚ÄúIs it a good idea, bringing her back here, to where everything happened over a traditional family holiday?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs adjusting well, as you know, but she needs the connection. They‚Äôve made a family, the four of them, but they don‚Äôt want Nixie to forget the family she lost.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll never forget.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll not, no.‚Äù And he himself would always carry the image of the little girl in the morgue with her head resting on her father‚Äôs un-beating heart. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you going back to Dallas.‚Äù Now he rose, stepped to her. ‚ÄúRevisiting, reliving all that pain and trauma. She had a family who loved her, and was taken from her.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo the connection‚Äôs important. Okay with me, but nothing‚Äôs going to induce me to go to that parade.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo noted.‚Äù He drew her in, kissed her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve a lot to be thankful for, you and I.‚Äù  
And a houseful of Irish relatives, plus a ravaging horde after turkey and pie are part of that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey are indeed.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know on Friday if I agree with that. Now I‚Äôve gotta go.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake care of my cop.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake care of my gazillionaire.‚Äù  
  
¬† She left the house resigned to the coming invasion.  
  
¬† What was it with people? Eve wondered. Clogging up her streets, flooding her sidewalks, jamming on glides, swarming cross-walks. What made them pack into New York for holidays?  
  
¬† Didn‚Äôt they have homes of their own?  
  
¬† She fought through three nasty knots of traffic on the trip downtown to Cop Central while ad blimps blasted the news from overhead of:  
  
¬† BLACK FRIDAY MEGA-SALES!  
  
¬† GOBBLE UP BARGAINS WHILE THEY LAST!  
  
¬† DOOR-BUSTER HOLIDAY SALES AT THE SKY MALL  
  
¬† She wished to God they‚Äôd all go to the sky mall and get out of her city. Snarling with equally pissed drivers at yet another tangle, she watched a quick-fingered street thief make hay with a gaggle of oblivious tourists crowded around a smoking glide-cart.  
  
¬† Even if she hadn‚Äôt been packed in among Rapid Cabs and a farting maxibus, the odds of catching him were slim. As fast-footed as fingered, he zipped away, richer by three wallets and two pocket ‚Äôlinks by her count.  
  
¬† The early bird catches the loot, she supposed, and a few less people would be hitting the sky mall.  
  
¬† She spotted a thin fracture in traffic, gunned it, and ignoring the rude blat of horns, wound her way downtown.  
  
¬† By the time she walked into Central, she had her plan. She‚Äôd hit the paperwork first, clear off her desk‚Äîrighteously. Then she could spend some time reviewing the active cases of her detectives. Maybe she‚Äôd toss the expense reports to Peabody, let her partner handle the numbers. There might be room to pull out a cold case, give it another hard look.  
  
¬† Nothing much more satisfying than catching a bad guy who thought he‚Äôd gotten away with it.  
  
¬† She stepped off the glide‚Äîa tall, leanly built woman in a leather coat‚Äîturned toward Homicide. Her short, choppy brown hair framed an angular face accented with a shallow dent in the chin. Her eyes scanned, as cop‚Äôs eyes always did, long, golden brown and observant as she strode down the busy sector to her department.  
  
¬† When she turned into her bullpen she spotted Sanchez first, his feet propped on his desk as he worked his ‚Äôlink. And Trueheart, spiffy and innocently handsome in his uniform, industriously at his comp. The room smelled of bad cop coffee and cheap fake sugar, so all was right with the world.  
  
¬† Jenkinson strolled out of the break room with a giant mug of that bad cop coffee and a lumpy-looking doughnut. He wore a gray suit the color of tarnish with a tie of nuclear blue and green curlicues on a screaming pink background.  
  
¬† He said, ‚ÄúYo, LT.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs some tie, Jenkinson.‚Äù  
  
¬† After setting the mug on his desk, he flipped it. ‚ÄúJust adding a little color to the world.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you steal that from one of the geeks in EDD?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis mama bought it for him,‚Äù Sanchez said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour mama bought it for me, as a thank-you for last night.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so she can see you coming from two blocks away and get gone.‚Äù  
  
¬† Before Jenkinson formed a witty repartee, Baxter walked in, slick in a dark chocolate suit, expertly knotted tie that picked up the color with minute checks of brown and muted red.  
  
¬† He stopped as if he‚Äôd hit a force field. ‚ÄúJesus, my eyes!‚Äù He pulled out a pair of fashionable sunshades, slid them on as he studied Jenkinson. ‚ÄúWhat is that around your neck? Is it alive?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour sister bought it for him.‚Äù Still quietly working at his comp, Trueheart didn‚Äôt even look up. ‚ÄúA token of her esteem.‚Äù  
  
¬† The kid was coming along, Eve thought, amused, and left her men to their byplay.  
  
¬† In her office with its single narrow window and miserably uncomfortable visitor‚Äôs chair, she aimed straight for the AutoChef. Thanks to the Roarke connection she didn‚Äôt have to settle for bad cop coffee. She programmed a cup, hot and black, settled with it at her desk, prepared to be righteous with paperwork.  
  
¬† Her communicator signaled before she‚Äôd taken the first sip.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDallas.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dispatch, Dallas, Lieutenant Eve. See the officer 735 Downing Street, Apartment 825. Two DBs, one male, one female.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDallas responding. Will contact and coordinate with Detective Peabody en route.‚Äù  
  
¬† Acknowledged. Dispatch out.  
  
¬† Well, shit, she thought, gulped down coffee‚Äîburned her tongue‚Äîshe had jinxed it. And grabbing the coat she‚Äôd just taken off, she headed out.  
  
¬† Others had arrived in the bullpen, and Jenkinson‚Äôs tie remained the topic of the day. Peabody, still wearing her coat, added her opinion that the tie had jazz.  
  
¬† But then Peabody loved the neon-sporting McNab.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPeabody, with me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? Where? Already?‚Äù  
  
¬† Eve just kept walking so Peabody had to trot after her in her pink cowgirl boots.  
  
¬† What was her department coming to, Eve wondered, with pink ties, pink boots. Maybe she should ban pink from Homicide.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did we catch?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLooks like a double.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA two-for-one start of the day.‚Äù As she waited for the elevator, Peabody took a scarf out of her pocket, looped it around her neck.  
  
¬† Pink and blue checks, Eve noted. She definitely had to work on the logistics of banning pink.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a totally gorgeous day, too,‚Äù Peabody continued, her square face wreathed with a smile, her dark eyes shining.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWere you late because you grabbed morning sex?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt late. Two minutes,‚Äù Peabody amended. ‚ÄúWe got off the subway early to walk it. You won‚Äôt have many more days like this.‚Äù  
  
¬† They squeezed into the elevator with a boxful of cops. ‚ÄúI love fall when everything‚Äôs all crisp and breezy, and they‚Äôre roasting chestnuts on the carts.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDefinitely had sex.‚Äù  
  
¬† Peabody only smiled. ‚ÄúWe had a date night last night. Just on the spur, you know. We got dressed up, went dancing, and had grownup cocktails. We get so busy we forget to do the ‚Äòjust you and me‚Äô thing sometimes. It‚Äôs nice to remember.‚Äù  
  
¬† They corkscrewed out on the garage level.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen we had sex,‚Äù Peabody added. ‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs a really nice day.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúToo bad the two DBs on Downing can‚Äôt enjoy it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell ‚Ä¶ yeah. It just goes to show.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShow what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou should get dressed up, go dancing, drink grown-up cocktails, and have sex as much as you can before you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a philosophy,‚Äù Eve said as she slid behind the wheel of her vehicle.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost Thanksgiving,‚Äù Peabody pointed out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard rumors.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe had this tradition, my family. We‚Äôd write down all the things we were grateful for, and put them in a bowl. And on Thanksgiving, everyone would pick out a few. The idea is, it reminds you of things you should be grateful for, or what other people appreciate. Like that. It‚Äôs nice. I know we‚Äôre not going out to be with the family this year, but I‚Äôm sending them my grateful notes.‚Äù  
  
¬† As she battled downtown traffic, Eve considered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre murder cops. That must mean we have to be grateful for dead bodies or we wouldn‚Äôt have a job. But contrarily, the dead bodies aren‚Äôt likely to be grateful.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. We‚Äôre grateful we have the skill and the smarts to find and arrest the person or persons who made them dead bodies.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe person or persons we catch and arrest aren‚Äôt going to be grateful. Somebody‚Äôs got to lose.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a philosophy,‚Äù Peabody muttered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like to win.‚Äù Eve pulled up behind a black-and-white on Downing. ‚ÄúI appreciate winning. Let‚Äôs go do that.‚Äù  
  
¬† Hefting her field kit, she started for the entrance, badged the cop on the door.  
  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on eight, Lieutenant.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I got that. Building security?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou have to buzz in, but you know how that goes. Cams on the door, but none internal.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll want the door discs.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBuilding manager‚Äôs on that.‚Äù  
  
¬† With a nod, she moved to the elevator. Decent building, she thought. Minimal security, but clean. The floor of the cubbyhole lobby shined, and the walls looked recently painted. And the elevator, she noted with some relief, didn‚Äôt clang or clunk when it opened.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEasy to gain access,‚Äù she commented. ‚ÄúFollow somebody in, or get someone to buzz you in. No lobby security, no internal cams.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEasy out, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExactly. The place is well maintained, so that says decent tenants and responsible management to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† She stepped out on eight, approached the cop standing in front of 825. ‚ÄúWhat have we got, Officer?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSir. The woman in 824 gained access to 825 at approximately seven-twenty this morning. She has a key and the code.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy did she go in?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe and the female victim had a regular Monday trip to the local bakery, leaving sharp, according to her statement, at seven. She became concerned when no one answered the door or the ‚Äôlink, and let herself in where she discovered the bodies she identified as Carl and Barbara Reinhold, listed as residents of this unit.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the wit?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWith a female officer in her apartment. She‚Äôs pretty broken up, Lieutenant. It‚Äôs rough in there,‚Äù he added, jerking his head toward 825.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKeep the wit handy.‚Äù Eve pulled a can of Seal-It from her bag. ‚ÄúAnd stand by.‚Äù She switched on her recorder.  
  
¬† With their hands and boots sealed, Eve and Peabody went inside.  
  
¬† Rough was one word for it, Eve thought. The living area remained tidy. Sofa pillows plumped, floors whistle clean, magazine discs neatly arranged on a coffee table. It made an eerie contrast to the smell of death‚Äîfar from fresh.  
  
¬† A few steps in the room jogged slightly to the right where a table served as a demarcation between living area and kitchen.  
  
¬† And where the line between tidy life and ugly death dug in deep.  
  
¬† The man lay beside the table, his head, shoulders, and one out-stretched arm under it. In death he was a bloody, broken mass in what had been a dark blue suit. Blood spatter and gray matter bloomed and smeared the walls, the kitchen cabinets‚Äîand the baseball bat that lay in the congealed river of blood beside him.  
  
¬† The woman lay facedown on the floor between the opposite side of the table and a refrigerator. Blood soaked through her shirt and pants so their true color had become indiscernible. Both were ripped and shredded, most probably by the kitchen knife driven through her back to the hilt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been slaughtered,‚Äù Peabody stated.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. A lot of rage here. Take the woman,‚Äù Eve ordered, and crouching by the man, opened her kit.  
  
¬† She let the pity come, then let it go. And got to work.  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVICTIM IDENTIFIED AS REINHOLD, CARL JAMES. Caucasian male, age fifty-six.‚Äù Eve scanned her Identi-pad. ‚ÄúMarried to Reinhold, Barbara, nee Myers, age fifty-four.‚Äù She glanced over at Peabody.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, female ID confirmed.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne offspring, male, Reinhold, Jerald, age twenty-six, address listed on West Houston.‚Äù  
  
¬† Carl Reinhold still had both parents, she noted, who‚Äôd migrated to Florida, and a brother with a Hoboken address. The data listed the victim‚Äôs employer as Beven and Son‚Äôs Flooring, with offices and showroom just a handful of blocks away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVictim was beaten severely, head, face, shoulders, chest, extremities. Injuries are consistent with the baseball bat handily left on scene, and coated with blood and gray matter. Erased his face. That‚Äôs personal.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt count the stab wounds on the female, Dallas. She‚Äôs been hacked to pieces.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say we‚Äôve got the cause of death. Let‚Äôs get the time.‚Äù  
  
¬† Eve pulled out her gauge. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been dead for about sixty-two hours. That puts it at Friday evening. Around six-thirty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe has almost six hours on him. TOD Friday, twelve-hundred-forty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNearly six hours between kills.‚Äù Eve sat back on her heels. ‚ÄúKills the woman in the afternoon, then what, waits around for the man? No sign of struggle in the living area. No sign of break-in.‚Äù  
  
¬† She pushed up. ‚ÄúGo ahead and call for the morgue and the sweepers.‚Äù  
  
¬† Solid middle-class couple from the looks of it, Eve thought as she began to wander the apartment. The woman lets someone in, middle of the day? No struggle. Both killed in the kitchen.  
  
¬† She set that train of thought aside once she stepped into what appeared to be the main bedroom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomebody tossed the bedroom,‚Äù she called out.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty strange and vicious for a burglary,‚Äù Peabody began, and stopped, frowning into the bedroom. ‚ÄúIt looks pretty tidy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPretty tidy, not perfectly tidy like the living area. Things are out of place here. The bedcovers aren‚Äôt smooth, the closet doors open, some clothes on the floor in there. That desk there‚Äîone of the drawers isn‚Äôt closed all the way, and where‚Äôs the comp? No comp or tablet on the desk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Eve pulled open a drawer on the bureau. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs jumbled in here. No, she kept a neat and clean house in a neat and clean building. Whoever did this was looking for something. I bet the wit‚Äôs been in here, and would know if anything‚Äôs missing.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou want her to walk through.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, after they take the bodies.‚Äù She walked out. ‚ÄúSecond bedroom, not so tidy either. Rug‚Äôs askew. Furniture‚Äôs got some dust on it. Why didn‚Äôt she clean in here? Closet‚Äôs empty,‚Äù she added, after pulling it open. ‚ÄúWho has an empty closet?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot me. If you have storage, you end up using it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomebody was staying in here. Dirty dishes scattered around, empty containers.‚Äù She walked to the bed, yanked the cover down, bent over to sniff the sheets. ‚ÄúSleeping here. Tag these. We could get DNA.‚Äù  
  
¬† She turned a circle. ‚ÄúSomeone staying here, someone they know. She‚Äôs in the kitchen, maybe fixing lunch that time of day. We‚Äôll run the log on the AutoChef. Maybe he wants something, and she won‚Äôt give it to him.‚Äù  
  
¬† Letting herself see it, she walked out again, back to the kitchen. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs pissed, oh, he‚Äôs so fucking pissed. The knife‚Äôs right there, just takes it out of the block and lets her have it. Over and over. Bet that felt good.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Peabody wondered. ‚ÄúWhy do you say it felt good?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt run, did he? He hung around, waiting to do her husband. Another overkill. So, yeah, I‚Äôm thinking it felt just fine. Note for sweepers to check all the drains. He had to clean up, he‚Äôd be covered with blood. But he‚Äôs got hours before the husband gets home. Hours to clean himself up, to change, and to go through the place. She probably had a couple pieces of decent jewelry, easy to hock.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd‚Äôve had emergency cash somewhere,‚Äù Peabody added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what you do, sock some away in case.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay. Jewelry, cash. Male vic‚Äôs wallet‚Äôs gone, and he‚Äôs not wearing a wrist unit. When we find her purse, her wallet‚Äôs going to be gone, too. Electronics‚Äîthat‚Äôs something we‚Äôre not seeing in here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEasy and portable.‚Äù  
  
¬† Eve looked at the victims again. ‚ÄúAnd an afterthought. You don‚Äôt kill like this for trinkets. You don‚Äôt kill people you know like this for some spare cash. You do it for a lot more. Maybe they had more. Let‚Äôs see what the neighbor has to say.‚Äù  
  
¬† Eve headed for the door, glanced back. ‚ÄúRun the son,‚Äù she told Peabody.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think somebody could‚Äôve done that to his own parents?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho pisses you off more than family?‚Äù She stepped out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear for Crime Scene,‚Äù she told the uniform. ‚ÄúAnd the wagon‚Äôs on the way. What‚Äôs the wit‚Äôs name?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSylvia Guntersen. Her husband‚Äôs Walter. HeÔøΩ  
ÔøΩÔøΩs in there, too. He stayed home from work.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù Eve knocked on 824. The female officer answered, a young blonde with her hair pulled back tightly at the nape of her neck.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Cardininni.‚Äù  
  
¬† The blonde smiled, her frosty blue eyes warmed. ‚ÄúHey, Peabody. Some morning, huh?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou could say. Officer Cardininni and I walked the beat together a few times.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBefore you went Murder on us. Lieutenant. It‚Äôs good meeting you. More or less.‚Äù She glanced over her shoulder. ‚ÄúThe woman‚Äôs taking it hard. The husband‚Äôs holding on, but not by much. They were tight with the vics. Lived across the hall from each other for about a dozen years. They hung a lot, took some vacations together. Close buds.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù  
  
¬† The apartment layout mirrored 825. The decor was less fussy, but the tidiness factor meshed. The Guntersens sat at the square-topped black kitchen table, cups in front of them. Eve judged them to be about the same age as the victims.  
  
¬† The woman wore her hair short, stylishly spiked, while the man went long and ponytailed. Both sets of eyes were red-rimmed, swollen. The woman took one look at Eve and began sobbing.  
  
¬† Eve only had to glance at Peabody to get her partner moving forward.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMrs. Guntersen, we‚Äôre so sorry for your loss. This is Lieutenant Dallas, and I‚Äôm Detective Peabody. We‚Äôre going to do our best for your friends.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey were my friends, our best friends.‚Äù She choked it out as she reached for her husband‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúHow could this happen to them?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to find out.‚Äù Eve took a seat at the table. ‚ÄúWe need your help.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI just worried when she didn‚Äôt answer, so I went in. I found them. I found Barb and Carl.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know this is hard,‚Äù Peabody began. ‚ÄúBut we have to ask you some questions.‚Äù She measured the woman, decided she‚Äôd do better with a task. ‚ÄúDo you think we could have some coffee, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. Yes. Of course.‚Äù Pulling herself together, Sylvia stood up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhen was the last time you spoke to or saw Barbara or Carl?‚Äù Eve asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI talked to Barb Friday morning. Just a quick chat before Walt and I left. We went to see our daughter and her fianc√© in Philadelphia for the weekend. They just got engaged.",1,1757439250.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Today was a new day. Today Pumba wanted cuddles, and was not happy just laying there. To make me aware of this immense offence to all cats, and especially him, he decided that the only proper course of action was to try and climb me. And once he got the attention he wanted he decided he could just hang on to my right cheek, which forced me to take a lot of his weight in my hands to spare my cheek from claw marks.

1ncparn,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1ncparn/my_boyfriend_and_his_friend_in_a_apartment/,My boyfriend and his friend in a apartment,"Problem/goal:We are 4 months talking at parang magjowa na kami. Pero isa to sa reason kung bakit hindi ko pa sya sinasagot(at mukhang di ko talaga sya sasagutin)

Nagkakilala kami sa friends of friends. As usual na ganap circle kami so tuwing may ganap sama-sama kaming lahat. During our 2nd month na magkakilala, one of our friends talked to him na need nya muna maki-stay sa apartment ng mutual ko. Pero since mabait sya at circle of friends naman kami walang naging problema don, not until may napapansin na ako.
I admit na struggling sya financially at nataon na yung friend namin na kasama nya sa apartment ay maraming side hustle mentioning na same sila ng profession so talagang magkakasundo sila and sabay na sila pumapasok at umuuwi from work. I see na nagtutulungan sila financially at nabibigyan nya ng extra yung mutual ko.

Weeks have passed and napapansin ko na kapag magkausap kami sa messenger, he keeps mentioning our friend at isisingit nya between our conversation and kapag magkakasama kami with circle I sense their closeness. As usual kapag may ganap kami w circle, sabay sila pupunta sa meetup place at sabay din sila uuwi dahil may motor naman si mutual. Madalas din silang tumambay sa bahay pero ayaw ni mutual na pupunta samin ng hindi kasama kaibigan nya. Tinatry ko naman alisin yung malisya since nasa circle of friends naman. Nagsimula nalang akong magduda pa lalo noong may araw na day off nila at ako naman may pasok, pag naisipan nila gumala ay gagala sila kahit sila lang dalawa.

Naging madalas din na kapag nagka-ayaan sa mga gimmick at kapag di sumama friend nya ay ramdam ko na rin na ayaw nya sumama. Nung birthday ko, excited sya na magsleep over sa bahay pero may kondisyon sya na pilitin ko rin na matulog samin yung friend nya and guess what nung araw na ng birthday ko, ayaw magsleep over ng friend nya and nagdecide na rin sya umuwi kahit antok na antok na sya. Since madalas sila tumambay sa bahay may moments pa na pinagtimtimpla nya ng coffee yung friend nya.

Mas madalas na rin silang mag-away dahil sa usual things kapag nasa iisang bahay may hindi napagkaka-sunduan. Nagsusumbong naman sya sakin pero minsan pag magkikita kita kami pero magkaaway sila, ramdam ko na affected yung moments namin dahil wala sya sa mood. 

Last week lang, meron sya inamin sa akin. Nag-aaral pala sila for master's degree and magclassmate sila. Nagulat nalang daw sya inenroll sya ng friend nya kaya wala na sya nagawa. Support lang naman ako dahil professional life nila yon.

Ang pinaka malala lang na bagay na nadiskubre ko sa kanila at  sumira lalo ng peace of mind ko ay nung time na nagtampo ako sa kanya dahil umuwi sya nung birthday ko at para makabawi sakin, doon sya natulog samin the other day. Gabi non at tinry ko buksan yung phone nya at nagulat ako na deleted yung convo nila ng friend nya.

The second time na nakitulog sya samin, ay nung naglaro kami ng volleyball. Nasa kalagitnaan na ako ng laro non at wala sa mood dahil expected ko na sasama sya pero nakatulog pala. Nagchat naman sya na susunod sya pero badtrip din sya dahil ayaw sumama ng friend nya at sinabi nya na mag sleep over sya sakin dahil magka-away sila. Pagdating nya sa court nagulat ako kasama nya yung friend nya pinilit nya raw sumama. After namin maglaro inaya ko sya na samin nga matulog pero bigla syang atras, ayaw na nya makitulog pero nagpumilit nalang ako dahil nagexpect nga ako... eto na yung 2nd time na nakitulog sya samin at tinry ko ulit buksan phone nya.

1ncp8jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ncp8jg/caffeine_withdrawal/,Caffeine Withdrawal,"I am an addict when it comes to coffee, or caffeine... If i try to stay at 3 cups per day, i start getting caffeine crashes just an hour before next cup is due, and after a while i add a forth cup per day. That works for a week or so, and then i need to add a fifth cup to resolve the crash that comes an hour before next cup is planned.

I was a nicotine user for many years, and never had any problems of this sort, but once i quit nicotine i started having problems with nausea, headaches, irritabillity, sleepyness, etc.. it took me a couple of years before i understod that it was caffeine withdrawal. I get the problems if i just skip one cup of coffee, headaches, nausea, depressed mood, it all comes 6-8 hours after the last cup.  Once i had a severe migraine and vomiting, it was really bad. There is a known and well established connection between caffeine and nicotine, the latter seams to protect the user from symptoms from caffeine withdrawal.

30 days ago i decided to quit caffeine, i begun with 300mg caffeine(3x100mg caffeine pills). About every third day i cut the dose with 25mg. Today was the third day i was on only 25mg(1 quarter of a pill in the morning). Tomorrow, i will be completely free from caffeine!

The symptoms im having now are mostly headaches(manageble), and some anxiety. My eyes are also pretty dry. I hope these symptoms will go away after a few days with no caffeine. Its strange that caffeine can be so addictive to some people, other people i talk to doesnt have any problems with quitting coffee.

His soft eyes were deep brown, the color of coffee before cream ‚Äî warm, comforting, a little wild. He watched the night sky with a reverence most people lose when they grow up.
However,time doesn‚Äôt ask permission to change us. His hands grew calloused and his voice deepened. He learned to fight, to shoot, to keep a straight face when the world split open. Most people say that boy is gone.

He‚Äôs not soft anymore, but he never went cold. You can still see him when he smiles, the little sparkle, though it‚Äôs rare now.

She rarely goes outside to potty. She is TERRIFIED. If we do manage to convince her to take a walk, a single noise can set her off, and she will start trying to drag you back home. Even a car door shutting. 

  
We started her on puppy Prozac in February of this year, and it didn't go well. She is normally a VERY hyper dog, and she was acting almost lethargic. She wasn't getting off the couch and was not responding to her name. She was just moping around. Not to mention, we had twins on March 3rd, and I'm sure the meds, PLUS the anxiety of two new screaming humans in the house, didn't help. Needless to say, we weaned her off the meds by the beginning of April. 

  
Now, we are ready to try her on meds again. Because her anxiety has only gotten worse and worse, she is currently on a 48-hour strike of not going outside because our neighbor down the street is getting a new roof put on. She is constantly hiding under our coffee table. The vet wants to put her on the same meds/dose as last time, but told us that we have to stick it out for 8 weeks (unlike last time) because it can take that long to even out. We were so sad seeing her that way last time, I'm scared to do it again. But I want her to live anxiety-free.

There's just no way I can picture this, narratively. Of course Rory would want a girl and Lorelai would want a granddaughter. Emily had a girl and then Lorelai had a girl so Rory is sure she'll have a girl. But it's a boy and no one knows what to go with a Gilmore boy and she names him Richard but Lorelai couldn't possibly call him that so she nicknames him Richie and it sticks. 

My headcanon is that he's quiet and shy and sweet and polite. Very smart and his face is always in a book. He just listens as his mom and grandmom yap non stop. He eats like them and Lorelai tries to give him coffee because ""five is old enough."" Anyways Rory's memoir is a success but after she becomes a mom, to a boy at that, she works through not having any idea what to do with the baby she was certain was a girl by writing stories for him. That turns into her being a very successful children's book author. She's at a book signing in NYC when Logan shows up with his girls.

I work with two other people, one whom is my coworker and the other is my director, aka the ""CEO"". Despite the coworker being awesome and minimizing my work as much as possible the director is complete opposite.

  
Minimum amount of hours for a minimum pay in my country is 40 hours for 1000bam (which is around 550 euros). But I work around 49 hours a week without extra pay, and on top of that I work overtime on top of my overtime sometimes for solid 30 minutes to an hour. I only get one free day in the week. 

  
The job in itself is physically exhausting, I carry heavy crates full of drinks on daily basis. I usually don't get allocated pauses, they're really only there for when I have to eat and last until I finish eating which means back to work. By now my work was kind of endurable. Even though I would come back home insanely exhausted I would still have time and energy to go to the gym or do my things (barely). But now that my nice coworker is on his summer break (he by the way almost alone does jobs for multiple people), I have to work alone with my director which is a nightmare. I stay at work for an hour longer on top of my already existing overtime. I get little to no breaks and I have to snuck in food during my deliveries to eat at all. Even if he offers a break it lasts only until the food is done. I am continuously on my feet. 

  
 Everybody around me likes to tell me that I'm lucky, that say bartenders which is the most common job for a guy my age to do at summer have it much harder, or the firm similar to ours treats their workers worse. And that my job is just perfect. That my boss is so good. The reason for that was when I once crashed the company vehicle at parking while going reverse, the boss was extra nice to me told me not to worry about and all will be fine whilst the company insurance covered everything.

  
After that incident I feel like I owe him something, and that overtime work is to be expected. But now it's becoming too much, I worked 9 hours today with barely any breaks and its been like that for the last 2 days and its gonna be like that until my nice coworker comes back to take some load off my back. I don't know if I should talk to my director or whether I'm being a b word or any of that. I'm very confused on what to do.",1,1757438524.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Distribution of household tasks has never been great to the point where 2 years ago even as I was working a 50 hr/ a week in I was still primarily the one doing laundry, cooking and doing dishes, child rearing,grocery shopping etc even though I was working more hours.  This last year I became an independent contractor so that I could reduce my work hours down to 20-30 hrs a week and use the remainder of the time to do close development and instruction for three days of home school curriculum my daughter has at her hybrid school.  I have still been responsible for everything household related. My husband recently returned back to work after taking a year off to focus on his recovery from addiction during which time he also was not regularly contributing to household chores and child rearing activities.  

Which brings us to the present: my husband took the day off work for a medical appointment and watched passively as I struggled to get my daughter out the door for school. I woke her up, brushed her hair, got her dressed, made everybody breakfast, packed her lunch, emptied a huge pile of recycling, compost, and trash, and some we were running late threw the dishes ( a frying pan and blender into the sink along with a pot I used for dinner the night before). No offers for help even as z I'm walking out the door balancing my daughter's lunch box, left over breakfast, my breakfast, a cup of coffee, and her school books in my hand while leaving. 

I drop my daughter off and get a call from husband saying, ""next time you're going to cook breakfast in the morning can you make sure you at least clean the dishes or put them in the dishwasher when you're done?"" 

I lose my shit and yell at him (probably the a.h for that).

He then asks ""I just want to make sure that if I do the dishes for you that you're going to acknowledge that I'm contributing and give me some recognition"".

I lost my shirt again and told him that 1) I have always given praise for him soon even the smallest bit of housework and 2) it was ridiculous that he wants praise and recognition for engaging in household tasks that should be shared labor anyway and which I *never* have gotten recognition for completing because again *it's basic expected adulting*.
More so I would NOT be praising him or going out of my way to acknowledge when he helps out in this way.

So one hand: as a therapist part of me is like, ""meh, positive reinforcement is going to motivate him to maybe help out more"" and if he already feels underappreciated for the ways he does contribute that's important to recognize and address and maybe I am fault for not wanting to do that.  

The other part of me is in full feminist rage over years of unseen labor, managing the entire mental load for everyone, the expectation that as a female I'm just supposed to do all of this with no recognition while recognizing my husband for doing the *exact same things I've been doing*.

Emphasizing the importance of character development during formative years, Singh highlighted virtues such as humility, strength, honesty, and respect. He praised NCS for its role in shaping students' character and aspirations through discipline, service, and patriotism. The Defence Minister also acknowledged the broader significance of Defence Ministry schools as vital platforms for nation-building that instill leadership, integrity, and responsibility in the next generation. During the event, he was briefed on NCS‚Äôs vision and achievements, while students shared how the school contributes to their holistic development. The students presented him with handcrafted tokens of respect, along with a Coffee Table Book and Crest, marking six decades of the school's contribution to education and character building, reflecting India‚Äôs commitment to supporting armed forces families and nurturing future leaders.

1ncowfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1ncowfj/always_fun_when_you_get_to_put_your_preps_to_use/,Always fun when you get to put your preps to use - power outage,"I don't consider myself a hard core survivalist prepper but I have basic preps, especially when it comes to power as I feel it's one of the easiest things to do and I'm also a bit of a nerd with that stuff. I was JUST about to make coffee when my power went out.  Moved the grinder and coffee machine to my bedroom where I previously installed a solar plug that is run from my shed's solar setup.  Successfully brewed my coffee. Looking at the Hydro map it looks like a fairly extended outage, affecting around 6k customers. 

My computer/server stuff is on -48v power, so that's been running fine too, I'm on the computer now.  Only thing I don't have is working lights (other than flashlights etc) so it's quite dark as the sun is not out today and it's pouring rain.  

I'm at a point where I would be making lunch by now but for now just holding off to see how long this lasts, as outages here are rarely super long.  I always like to be a step ahead, so if it does go extended, I can easily run an extension cord to the microwave as that would be the most efficient way to warm food up as it's only a few minutes and most of the energy goes to the food.  Could also use the BBQ but really don't feel like going out there in the cold and rain, but it IS an option if I'm desperate. 

Not worried about fridge/freezer at this point, but will ensure not to open it at all for now. Trying to order food right now would be futile, so won't even try doing that.  If any areas are even still cooking they are probably super busy. 

If this does end up going longer then I also have a generator I can hook up to the shed solar system once that battery runs out.  At that point I'd start thinking about the fridge and freezer too. 

Always nice to think ahead, but for now I can just sit back and have my coffee without really worrying about anything.",11,1757438189.0,preppers,1,0.92,False

I panicked, but then noticed my drink had writing on it with orange sharpie.

I even went back in to ask for water to see if I can take another look at it. The second I opened the door I saw his knuckles and they did look like 3 orange marks. But I couldn‚Äôt get a perfect look since he was moving. 

I was soooo tempted to throw out the drink.
Doing so would be giving in.
I did take a few sips but not going to lie I was stressed and now concerned I drank blood. 

I ended up throwing out the rest. Proud of myself for taking a few sips but upset I threw out the rest and stressed if it was blood and the thought of it getting in my drink.

1ncopbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ncopbx/my_35f_best_friend_31f_replaced_me/,My (35f) best friend (31f) replaced me,"Long story short, I had a best friend (40m) coworker. Worked together, families vacationed together, talked all the time, borderline EA/emotionally involved. Both married happily. Basically few years ago coworkers family and mine were away on vacation, and the day we got home he told me we can‚Äôt be best friends anymore. Yada yada, I dealt with that poorly and it was like a legit breakup, but whatever. I was open with my spouse about it but I do not believe coworker was open with his spouse as much as I was.

I took it hard, but created space and developed closer friends at work, and one girl specifically (31f). Became bff, cried together over things, relied on each other, supported each other. Great conversations and same values, we found comfort in each other and were always together. I started getting a feeling she had been becoming close with my ex best friend (40m) and she denied they text or talk very much. I even told her it would wreck me if she replaced me as his new bestie. But she denied incessantly. But now, she seems to know everything he‚Äôs doing, where he was working, always chatting at work, knows personal details of his social plans. Things I used to do with him. Him and I don‚Äôt speak at all, it didn‚Äôt end well and she knew that. Supporter me through it all. But, now his name comes up many times in her conversations.. so, as I should not have (and never have done this before) I decided to snoop when she gave me her phone to order coffee. I peeked at her text to prove to myself that they don‚Äôt communicate often and that I‚Äôm being paranoid. But, there it was, top of the messages; they had been talking shit via text 1 hour prior, from across the fucking room. And the texts went further and further back, so often it reminded me of MY friendship with him. I had a solid 10 second peek and then felt guilty, ashamed and like I broke HER trust. 

Now, I‚Äôm mad at myself for snooping, angry that she didn‚Äôt defend me when ex-best friend said something rude, and mad at HIM for making a comment that was hurtful. We (me and 40m) were attached. Like I said, emotionally attached to the point it interfered with his marriage. It was a 4 year EA no doubt. We created space and distance and navigated through it differently to the point we only interact when necessary at work. BFF (31f) was there for me as support through all of this. And now she‚Äôs basically taken my place at HIS side as his new bestie and my feelings are hurt AF.

No, she doesn‚Äôt know I snooped. But I think she knows something is up and probably assumed I saw something because I handed her phone back and completely changed my demeanor. I don‚Äôt know how to go about this because I‚Äôm the one that broke her trust by snooping. But she broke mine a long time ago apparently. I don‚Äôt know how to proceed with all of this. I‚Äôm too old for drama. 

Edit- I‚Äôm hurt that my actions interfered with someone else‚Äôs marriage. Nothing ever happened but I underestimated the toll emotional attachment can take on relationships. I own that. I‚Äôm ashamed. But I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to navigate friendship with 31f.",1,1757437752.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1ncooqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TAZCirclejerk/comments/1ncooqo/recap_the_empty_bowl_120/,[Recap] The Empty Bowl #120,"It‚Äôs an incredibly slow day here at work so I figured I would attempt my shot at a recap because I‚Äôm bored, my situationship has blown up and I‚Äôm going to begin my descent into a depression spiral. So why not attempt to cheer myself up with a nice calm podcast.

Since I never see anyone here really mention it, a little background on this podcast. Empty Bowl is a podcast with everyone‚Äôs favorite brother (No, the other one) and Dan from Cerealously. It‚Äôs a chill, very loose vibes podcast about cereal, cereal news and reviews and just fun times. It‚Äôs one of the better products in the McElverse imo

This episode‚Äôs description is:

‚ÄúDan sleeps in an egg, Justin hallucinates marbits, and we explore the many layers of what makes the perfect cereal treat‚Äù.

Sounds delightful.

Okay let‚Äôs get started I guess??

I‚Äôve always loved the opening to this show. It‚Äôs so nice and relaxing, the waves crashing. I‚Äôd like to someday eat a bowl of my favorite cereal on the beach at sunset.

Justin: ‚ÄúSometimes you can just eat it when you‚Äôre hungry, a lot of people forget that.‚Äù So true, bestie. So true.

Damn, Cream of Wheat catching a stray from Dan.

They always mention people sleeping to their podcast. Do people actually fall asleep to podcasts? I couldn‚Äôt do that. I need to fully listen to any podcast I regularly listen to. ¬†I mean I fall asleep to how its made episodes on youtube, but that‚Äôs just basically white noise. I guess there are probably podcasts meant to sleep to?

Dan: ‚ÄúWhat is sleep but a brain vacation?‚Äù

Oh, am I about to get an answer to my question? Justin asks Dan what they listen to when they fall asleep and Dan talks about a ‚Äúspecific system‚Äù of white noise with an air purifier, a white noise machine and a box fan. This is the aforementioned egg, I see. Dan‚Äôs sonic egg sounds so pleasant.

Justin says he has a white noise machine but also sleeps wearing headphones (that can‚Äôt be comfortable) and mentions he listens to boring books, sleep podcasts (!) and youtube videos he doesn‚Äôt care about.

Okay off to episode start with a fast-food collaboration with Midwestern favorite Culvers (Munch Squad Lite lets fuckin gooooo). Cereal concrete mixers inspired by classic favorites. Justin mentions a manager, Amanda (Empty Bowl manager? Or McElroy Fam manager?) who ‚Äúbullies‚Äù them to eat Culvers. I like Culvers. There‚Äôs a couple near my job and I‚Äôve grabbed them a couple times and they‚Äôre not bad. I love a cheese curd.

We‚Äôve got Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch concrete mixers. Fuck, I kinda wanna get one of those Cinnamon Toast Crunch ones. CTC is one of the top 5 cereals of all time btw.

Justin makes a joke that this is dangerous for a fast food joint because of how decadent they all sound and you need a chaise lounge to recline on. Dan mentions how much he loved when a fast food release comes with a press release and I just know Justin was salivating at the thought. Justin says the copy editor in him wants to take a red marker to the press release. ‚ÄúJust say the cereal makes them sweeter, eat 4.‚Äù

Now it‚Äôs time for the hot news in the cereal world, starting off with‚Ä¶

Mexican hot chocolate Cinnamon Toast Crunch. This sounds genuinely incredible to me. Justin thinks it‚Äôll taste like simply chocolate CTC because ‚ÄúMexican hot chocolate‚Äù implies cinnamon in chocolate anyway. Dan worries they‚Äôll have that Cinefuego Toast Crunch seasoning left and will use it in this. Please, anything but that. What a disaster that was. Justin laments how none of the Walmarts around him are cool and release things super early and I feel his pain so much.

Okay next up is....a variety of Chex. Caramel Corn Chex. Fuck yes, dude. Justin is hyped, I‚Äôm hyped. This could be realllly good. I love how Dan talks about cereal. Dan jokes that you can make those popcorn tins out of Chex now with these and the Chex mix and that sounds kinda good lol

Next up we have Great Value (Walmart) brand red velvet cake cereal. Dan sheepishly confesses he doesn‚Äôt understand what red velvet is. Justin mentions it‚Äôll be chocolate and red velvet is just chocolate dyed red. Which I don‚Äôt think is true? I feel like it‚Äôs more than that? Anyway, my best guess is that it would be like those loaded cereals with chocolate cereal casing and like a gross ‚Äúfrosting‚Äù inside. Or even just a chocolate cereal with marshmallows, like Justin thinks. Idk red velvet is okay, not my favorite thing.

Lastly, something in the world of oatmeal. New Quaker instant and it‚Äôs caramel macchiato flavored oatmeal. So..I guess just caramel oatmeal? I doubt it‚Äôs caffeinated. Also, I just wanna mention when I worked as a barista, I hated when people would order a caramel macchiato and then shake or stir their drink. That‚Äôs not what a macchiato is!!! You just wanted a vanilla latte with caramel drizzle!!! And that‚Äôs okay!! I know I shouldn‚Äôt care that much because it was Starbucks, not real coffee, but it annoyed me. I know it‚Äôs an insufferable take. Anyway. Justin mentions how they should caffeinate this oatmeal because how great a start to the day would be if he could just heat up water and throw this in and get his coffee and protein and other stuff in one. And he‚Äôs right!

Time for cereal reviews! This is always my favorite part.

Firstly, the Wicked cereals. Dan talks about walking into a Target as a 29 year old man, only buying two boxes of Wicked cereal and leaving. Turns out the yuri cereal is just Carmela Creeper and Booberry repackaged. Dan says they‚Äôre actually better than the Monster cereals they come from because of the cereal shapes and lack of marshmallows. I dunno if it‚Äôs a hot take or whatever, but I don‚Äôt like marbits in my cereals tbh. Justin says cereals like this are just good to grab a handful and eat like ‚Äúkid kibble‚Äù.

Speaking of yuri cereal, Justin has tried the Enid (?) cereal, which is a Wednesday tie-in. I haven‚Äôt seen this show, so I have zero knowledge of it outside of its existence. It‚Äôs a cupcake flavored cereal that is completely mediocre. Justin says the boxes are more aesthetically pleasing than the Wicked cereal and it turns the milk purple, which is fun. ‚ÄúSomeone should blend Wednesday and Enid together and see how it comes out‚Äù. Dan jokes that it‚Äôs a task for a dedicated fan to do and Justin says ‚ÄúOr a slash fiction author‚Äù. Made me chuckle. Justin is funny, you guys.

Dan has a cereal from Japan, ‚ÄúNissin Uji Matcha Granola‚Äù with strawberries and mochi. Which already sounds good as hell. I feel like a matcha cereal could be very interesting. There‚Äôs dried mochi bits that are ‚Äúboba-like‚Äù once rehydrated in the milk and that sounds yummy. Dan is loving it and the endmilk is essentially a matcha latte. I‚Äôm definitely gonna check eBay for this one.

Dan and Justin go off on a tangent about milk and how Justin thinks its funny that Dan calls regular dairy milk ‚Äúnormal milk‚Äù and how ‚Äúnormal for you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs normal for me‚Äù. Listener question time!

Question asker is curious how many gallons of milk is a normal amount to buy with a family of 3 between cereal and coffee. They say they run out of milk within 2 to 3 days.

Justin has moved onto some non-dairy milks because it makes him feel better. Justin mentions a service called ‚ÄúImperfect Foods‚Äù which seems like a service that sends you ‚Äúugly‚Äù produce or overstock, which seems like a great way to deal with food waste. He mentions a barista oat milk which is a coffee additive but he‚Äôs using it in his cereal and says it‚Äôs absolutely delicious. I agree with Justin where oat is also my favorite of all non-dairy milks. Almond and Soy are okay, but I feel like oat does the job better.

Justin‚Äôs kids don‚Äôt eat cereal which he claims is ‚Äúone of the great failures of my life‚Äù. Charlie is lactose intolerant apparently. That reminds me of the time a few years ago when I was brand new at a job and was meeting my boss for the first time. We were talking and someone made a comment about lactose intolerance and I mentioned, jokingly ‚ÄúIf I was lactose intolerant, I would kill myself‚Äù. He looked at me and said, in a very serious voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lactose intolerant. Should I kill myself?‚Äù and it was genuinely the most tense I have ever felt a room. Then he laughed. I felt actual fear that day.

Dan mentions about how dairy milk was exacerbating his acne in high school and he switched to non-dairy and it cleared it up. He thinks that by drinking non-dairy from then until adulthood, he gave himself a mild case of intolerance. He only went back to regular dairy because he missed cheese and that‚Äôs so fucking real of him, y‚Äôall. He sticks to lactose free 2% which seems like the best of both worlds. He mentions he also shares his milk with his cats and knows you‚Äôre not supposed to give them milk, but cites one of his friend‚Äôs 19 year old cat (!) with longevity because it would drink a little think of heavy cream every day.

Justin brings up a Tiktok he saw for a recipe for ‚Äúapple pie marshmallow treats‚Äù and asks Dan (and listeners) about desserts being recreated with cereal. What other desserts could you recreate with layered cereal bars? Justin says a Boston cr√®me pie, with a layer of Cap‚Äôn Crunch, chocolate toast crunch and a vanilla cereal.

We didn‚Äôt do any cereal rankings this episode, which is a bummer. Shoutout to the Patreon (Hey they should do that for the other McElroy shows or something).

Anyway, nobody will read this probably but it‚Äôs fine. It helped me kill an hour.

My title is Operations Manager but my role functions more like an Admin Assistant. I used to be an Admin Assistant and the role was pretty typical. Calendars, coffee, calls, emails, events, etc. 

However, my current boss has me running all kinds of personal errands. Picking up dry his cleaning (sheets and comforters and such - not clothes he‚Äôs wearing to work) and dropping it off at his home. Walking his dog occasionally (from the office). Depositing personal checks. Buying moving boxes and taking them to his residence. Running to the store to get him certain medications (I kind of get this one).

I go into the office on M and W. My job also requires a lot of errands for work related activities. Grocery runs to stock the kitchen, mailing packages, picking up prints, paying fees, etc. 

He‚Äôs recently told me that he doesn‚Äôt want me running errands on the days I‚Äôm in the office and I need to do those on my WFH days. 

All of this is frustrating to me. I‚Äôve never been asked to handle so many personal errands, and I don‚Äôt live in the same town as my office. It‚Äôs only 20 min away, but I don‚Äôt feel like I should be asked to run errands on days I‚Äôm not in the office and WFH.

I‚Äôm an athletic 28-year-old from London with long black curly hair, seeking a Domme to build a dynamic with.

**About Me**

My hobbies include film, and I‚Äôm passionate about everything from classic and foreign films, to horror and schlocky B movies. I love music, and you can often find me at rock, metal, and hardcore shows around the city, as well as the odd jazz night too! I climb, hike and go to the gym fairly frequently, and I love it when my partner enjoys my body. I'll put a link to a picture of me (minus my face) here:¬†[https://ibb.co/gZJzJv8L](https://ibb.co/gZJzJv8L)

**What I'm Looking For**

I‚Äôm looking for a woman between the ages of 21‚Äì35. I need a connection before starting a dynamic and I would love to talk about your interests and hobbies. I'm very politically engaged and consider myself rather left wing, so ideally I would like to find someone who shares a good amount of my world view.

**Now Onto The Fun Stuff**

If you think we‚Äôd make good play partners, FWB or romantic partners, feel free to pop me a message. I would love to build a 24/7 dynamic, but that‚Äôs not essential. Though I am a switch, I would love to deepen my submission and serve someone IRL who I can be proud to call my Domme.

My main kinks include service (including domestic service), worship, orgasm control, humiliation, and of course power exchange! I‚Äôm not a brat, and I love to obey and be of use to you; serving you and making your life better however I can. I‚Äôm not looking for a gentle or ‚Äúsoft‚Äù dynamic, and I prefer something closer to a traditional M/s style of play.

Soft limit: pegging.

This cleverly produced video faking psychokinesis reflects our culture‚Äôs superficial fascination with psychic phenomenon.¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3_M)

Viewing this elaborate hoax with a special effects crew gives me cause to discuss the theme of psychic ability among contactees. On several occasions I witnessed psychokinesis carried out by a fellow volunteer contact worker that I call ""Misha."" We worked together from 1993 till 1997.

There is a broad spectrum of contact experiences. On one extreme you have a simple sighting. Many people believe that these are random events, but in my judgment, they are not. I am of the opinion that even simple sightings are staged or programed events. I strongly suspect that flying saucer intelligences probably have a consciousness link with every ‚ÄúUFO perceiver."" I imagine that this is hard for most people to accept. It certainly was so for me. It took years of volunteering in networks of activists that I call ‚Äúthe contact underground‚Äù to lead me to this assessment.

On the other extreme, there are those individuals that I label ""prime contactees."" They are the same kind of contact experiencers who are being called ‚Äúpsionic assets.‚Äù These remarkable individuals are usually trained to attract UFOs during psychic interactions with the so-called ""ETs"". This process often starts from childhood, adolescence or early adulthood and they can exhibit unusual parapsychological talents. Direct telepathic communications with UFO intelligences can be one of them. Misha, I strongly suspect, had this. However when I asked him about it, he usually responded with enigmatic statement like ""I can't talk about it. It‚Äôs not safe."" And then he clamed up and refused to say anything more.

Another talent that prime contactees can have is¬†¬†psychokinesis. While driving with Misha to a contact research site in the Mohave Desert in May of 1994, we had a dispute. I had just purchased a used 1991 Isuzu 4-wheel-drive Trooper. We were on a power line dirt road just a few miles from the perimeter of Fort Irwin near Highway 15. Power lines were over us as we bounced along a rocky path that had been bulldozed across a rugged desert landscape.¬†

Misha wanted me to engage the 4-wheel drive mechanism, but I was steering and deemed it not necessarily as we were making good progress without it. We argued this point for a few minutes when suddenly the lever controlling the 4-wheel drive ON ITS OWN moved into position. The display panel lit up and we were in 4-wheel drive. No one had touched the lever. It had been under my continuous observation as Misha and I were talking.¬†

When I purchased the vehicle, I was told by the owner that the only way I could safely engage the 4-wheel-drive mechanism was to stop the car, back up to lock the tires into 4-wheel drive mode, and then and only then move the lever forward into place. An Isuzu dealer's mechanic asserted that it was impossible for the mechanism to spontaneously on its own go into gear without carrying out the prescribed procedure. Misha was as surprised as I was when this happened, but he indeed wanted us to be in 4-wheel-drive and that's what happened. One two other occasions he used his apparent psychokinetic powers to accomplish other tasks. In one of those examples, he was able apparently able to move an object¬†¬†that was about 100 feet away.

I ask fellow contact experiencers to please share their personal accounts of apparent psychokinetic phenomenon that they have witnessed.",0,1757437222.0,HighStrangeness,1,0.38,False

Then again by 29 I stopped again for 6 months.

And then I have been lying to myself that I will stop, but actually I never kept myself away from the glass for more than 1 month.

Last year I went to a rehab for 20 days. I could not stay for longer as I was afraid to lose my job and I did not have the means to pay for more time.

I drank like 20 long neck beers last night and went to poker club, which is now a co-addiction. I lost like 200USD, which isnt much but in the currency of my country (Brazil) is a lot. I lost like 1kUSD in the last month.

I cant handle it anymore. I lie to myself that it doesnt harm me and that I do not need to take life so seriously, as it will end anyways. But I know Im destroying my body and brain. I am afraid of long term damages.

I am going through a separation and its been really hard.

A thing that is really hard for me is drinking a lot of coffee, which gets my mind rolling and the only way to relax is through drinking alcohol. Anyone relates?

Anyway, just liked to vent. I am taking this decision now. Ill go to AA this week. I know it has its perks but its objective isnt to be fun, but to remind us of avoiding the first drink.",4,1757437082.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False
1ncoebu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ncoebu,Hoarding roommate Part 2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/6houwOyloX

¬†part 1: I moved in with  a woman and her ex-husband. Hoarding has gotten worse (since ex husband left) and she started nagging me about shared living areas. 


Pictures attached.. I tried to upload video. I took pictures of her hoarding right next to the sparkling white kitchen and sink she demands is alway left like that. Also screenshots telling her to leave me alone after brushing off all my concern.
¬†
I talked to this 60 year old lady to try to reason with her. My concerns were her constant nagging on areas that are shared and only me. like the restroom i was given access too.
¬†
1. ""i don‚Äôt like the phrase constant nagging"" i asked her what word was adequate. silence. she tried to compromise by giving me more fridge space (besides a sad shelf) . i accepted it because she told me i would just have to be more careful in the kitchen. ( i left a dish soaking and she called it a spill) everything is a spill to her. I told her to please take the fridge space back and she got really passive aggressive ""I WILL NOT TAKE THE FRIDGE BACK. I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE BACK YOUR WORD. EVERY SPILL MUST BE CLEANED promptly). i told her to please give me a break. I work 40 hours a week . i don‚Äôt have the energy to do her every whim. sometimes i might not be able to fix whatever she is unhappy with. I understand spills in the kitchen but i told her to please pick her battles.
¬†
2. i confronted her about her words implying i steal or take things that are not mine¬† . and i brought up an example where i brought food to share with her and ONLY her. I went hiking all day and this woman looked me in the face with a smile and said ""I had guests over and young lady i couldn‚Äôt help but give away your kiwis :) each person took 3 or 4"" i brushed it off. but how dare i grab an empty shoe rack int he middle of the hoarding mess she has. i apologized but told her to look in the mirror. ( i know i was wrong. i shouldn‚Äôt have grabbed it. but i didn‚Äôt know how deeply attached she was to her things. ). She brushed off the my comment and denied saying ""i dont know what else you are taking"" while staring at me as if i was a thief. ( i make 6 figures, she knows this ) . she then said ""if you heard this its because you have low self-esteem"" . which pissed me off because i have shared personal stuff with her when i was at my lowest. Honestly I can see this from her point of view. She didnt call me a thief to my face but the sentiment is there. 
¬†
3. I told her to please stop nagging when im in the kitchen or leave a dish soaking . that we could come up with an agreement over kitchen stuff. that constant nagging is too much.¬† i proposed for example. i might leave a dish in the sink for the day. but lets say if its 9pm i feel free to nag me! i will welcome it . ""no we can‚Äôt do this then i will stare at it all day while you are at work. clean everything even a spoon. immediately! ""
¬†
4. I tried to be logical and say im sorry for the minor things i can‚Äôt follow daily but i work every day, go to the gym, hiking. i have a life. (this woman spent her life as a homemaker. with odd jobs) i tried to start my sentence with . ""you don‚Äôt do anything all day. you wake up drink your coffee -"" . she cut me off ""Don‚Äôt say that . you do not get to judge how i live"" . I have NEVER said anything to make her feel judged. Hell, i would love to live her life. i tried to pivot. ""you have a full life with friends and family""- ""DO NOT SAY THAT , DONT JUDGE ME"" . This is my first indication that she is deeply unhappy with her life. Especially since her ex left her to enjoy his retirement. I have been her almost a year and teh only time ive seen her kids is when they were packing her stuff up.
¬†
5. I told her i have been scared to voice any concerns because i know she has the power to kick me out at any time. ""you were the one who asked me to move in when (ex roommate/common friend) moved out and i accepted"" and ""you were the one to check out and tell me you are leaving"" . and ""i would never do that"" . Evading the fact that i give her rent promptly every month. It made me feel like i live rent free here... and she has gotten worse since her ex left. and at first i complied to her every demand so I should‚Äôve put my foot down. Every point I tried to make she denied and countered it. Not one sorry. I would‚Äôve taken a fake apology.

6 since we were discussing stealing i told her gluttony is also a sin. How could she hoard all this food that she will never eat ."" I grew up in poverty and having a full pantry brings me joy."" She has two freezers and is constantly filling up the fridge. She is hyperfocused on clearance deli food from Safeway or Kroger. Food that is about to expire. I have had to clear moldy cheese from her side of the fridge.. about her hoarding shes only said ""my house brings me deep shame"" that's it. 
¬†
This woman constantly texts me. after this interaction she texted me alot and moved my laundry as a olive branch? She also got a Jeep duck for my car. Shes given me some things for my birthday and I am thinking of leaving it all behind for her to keep. I want nothing to do with her. ¬†She doesn‚Äôt understand how harmful and unsafe i feel in this house. I felt like she was stepping over and refusing to see reason . (i know its dumb since i can now see she‚Äôs so far gone) . I told her to please stop contacting me unless its her nagging me. basically.. I don‚Äôt know if this was smart. she has lost control of me. and will soon.¬†
¬†
I never once judged this woman's life of cleanliness. These arguments were just a counter to her nonsense. If she wasn't trying to control my life I would of never brought them up. Maybe as a friend out of concern .
At one point i realized we were talking in circles. I told her i have lost respect for her and i cant pretend to act like as if nothing has happened. I know im prideful but I feel like I have tolerated too much from this individual.

Prefered drinks: Mixture of filter coffee and Espresso, usually milk drinks. Occasional drip coffee.   
Budget: $500\~ but open to suggestions for the right machine. Buy once cry once.   
  
I am looking to purchase a grinder for both Espresso and Filter coffee. I have had a second hand Baratza Encore for about 10 years now. It works OK for drip coffee and pour overs but is not capable of producing an espresso grind. I am looking to upgrade to a grinder that has the capability to grind for pour-over/drip coffee as well as espresso. This would also be my first foray into nicer equipment and I am not totally sure what I should (or shouldnt) be considering and why. All advice is appreciated. 

When I have seen this question asked elsewhere on the net people usually get the answer ""well you really need two grinders"" which isnt something I am willing to pay for, put up with or deal with in any way. I need one machine to handle both tasks. 

So far I have three machines under consideration but I am not sure if I am missing anything or the pros and cons of each one

**Timemore 064s** \- Seems popular around the web for my usecase. Unfortunately I dont love the look of this machine but I am willing to ignore that if it really does preform as well as people say it does. 

**DF64 Gen 2** \- This seems more like a dedicated Espresso machine but I see posts floating around that it can do filter coffee with some success and not too much fuss. 

**Eureka Mignon Zero 65 All Purpose** \- Newer machine, I cant seem to find much about it online. It seems very well suited to my usecase though. I like that it can fit a slightly larger amount of coffee in case I want to brew multiple cups of filter coffee. 

Special Considerations that could convince me to stretch my budget

**Eureka Mignon Libra 65 all purpose** \- Nearly $400 more than any grinder on this list. *However* this grinder features the special adjustment wheel of the Zero 65 for multi purpose grinding with nicer burrs (I think, could be wrong) and it features weighted grinding functionality. That is a workflow improvment I know I would seriously enjoy, it would streamline the process in a way that would be good for me. 

Machines with a slightly larger hopper while also being low retention for bean changes and grind changes are a big plus in my book that, if good enough, might make me expand the budget.

1ncodny,https://www.reddit.com/r/elf/comments/1ncodny/experiences_made_on_the_vippackage_of_the/,Experiences made on the VIP-Package of the Championship Game,"Hey folks, thought I could make a little post about the VIP-Package Situation in Stuttgart last Sunday.

A friend of mine and me were lucky enough to win two VIP-Tickets for the final in the ELF-Advent Calendar last year.
We were beyond happy and looked forward to the event.
Sadly Fire didn't make it but I just think that fact made it better for my heart to survive the tension of a close game. üòÖ

As for the tickets we were not briefed what was included but I made some research beforehand and found out about this page where the tickets have been on sale and had that description on what was included in the VIP-Package:

https://web.archive.org/web/20250326152344/https://www.official-vip.com/elf-championship-game-2025

(Wayback-Machine because already offline by now)

So it stated in terms of food:

Before, after and during the game.
Self-Service-Buffet
Upper Class Cuisine (Buffet)
Live-Cooking Station
Fingerfood

Reality was:
Before the game you had the option of two Appetizers (Caesar's Salad or Wrap) , two main dishes (Mac&Cheese or SlowRib with vegetables, apricot polenta and sauce) and one desert (Mousse au Chocolat).
Half-Time-Snack was a portion of nachos with sour cream, cheese sauce and jalape√±os and somewhere between quarter 3 and 4 I saw 2-3 people with french fries, but no clue where they got them from.
After the game - no food a all.
No ""Live Cooking"", no fingerfood.

In terms of drinks the page stated:

Beer, wine, sparkling wine, cocktails and all sorts of alcohol free beverages. All of that with an exclusive cocktail-bar a barista-bar wine-bar and sparkling-wine-bar.

Reality was:
Beer on tap, wine, alcohol free beers and lemonades, cola, you name it.
No signs of cocktails, sparkling-wine or even an espresso.
I overheard a conversation at the bar where a woman asked for a sparkling-wine and was rejected because ""the organizer [ELF] didn't allow sparkling-wine"".
Same with the coffee as a dude told us when he ordered an espresso that it wasn't ordered by the organizer.

In case of hospitality and availability of the services the page stated:
120min before the game and at LEAST 150min after the game.

Reality was:
We entered round about 120min before so valid ‚Äì but AFTER the game we went up to get another beer and found out that they were advised to stop giving out drinks by 18:30.
That was more like 20min after the game and by 40min after the game we were asked to leave.

In our case we were fine with it because we won the tickets but there were great numbers of people arguing with the staff. And I completely understand their point. If I had payed 399‚Ç¨ and were denied services that were advertised before I would have been mad as well.

Last but not least ‚Äì our seats were in row 8, so close to the field.
The only operating bar and toilets were completely up where the box seats are located. So we had to walk for ages for a new beer and ""return"" the last one.

All in all we had a great day and it was nice to experience the VIP-thing ‚Äì but all in all I had the feeling the ELF was on super-low-budget-mode and if I had payed the money I would have been super disappointed.

TL;DR: ELF seemed to be super-low-budget on the VIP-Tickets ‚Äì would not have been worth the 399‚Ç¨ ",14,1757437025.0,elf,1,0.94,False

I‚Äôm also sensitive to smells. The overbearing smell of potpourri, synthetic cinnamon, overbearing or cloying ‚Äúfuneral home flowers‚Äù smell, or strong ‚Äúold-lady perfume‚Äù will make me sick/nauseous. 

But for the past few days, maybe the past week, a smoke/stale cigarette smell is lingering in my nose. I do not smoke anything. No one in my household or workplace smoke. I am rarely ever around cigarette smoke. 

We did have a fire in the fire pit last weekend but this began before that and it doesnt seem to be related. 

Often times it proceeds a migraine, and I also had it pretty badly before a really severe bout with Covid in the spring. 

But it‚Äôs really bad today and I have no idea how to combat it or cure it or alleviate it. It‚Äôs so miserable. My nostrils just feel filled with a smoke smell, sometimes mixed with burnt coffee. Any advice?

I'm a software engineer, so by the time I get home, my brain feels like mush. I've been trying to build a consistent writing habit for the past year, and it's been... a struggle. But I've found a few techniques that actually work when willpower is at zero.

**Artificial deadlines**: I create fake deadlines for myself in a planner - when to write, when to edit, when to post. Sounds stupid, but it tricks the part of my brain that used to work best right before college assignment deadlines.

**Tiny calendar blocks**: I started with just 10-minute writing blocks. Not ""write the great American novel"" blocks - just ""turn thoughts into words"" blocks. The consistency matters more than the output.

**Embracing imperfection**: This was the biggest game-changer. I have a folder full of half-finished posts I was too scared to publish because they weren't perfect. Finally realized my ego was protecting itself from criticism by never finishing anything. Now I just try to get something done rather than something perfect.

The weird thing is that sometimes being tired actually helps. You're too exhausted to overthink, too drained for perfectionism. You just put words down because that's all you have energy for.

[Still figuring this out though](https://open.substack.com/pub/cafeflo/p/six-techniques-for-writing-when-youre?r=57dmps&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false).

I have a friend from out of state coming to visit October 9-18. We have most of the day on the 18th before she leaves. She's excited to experience ""real fall"" and I want to find some fun things for us to do! This visit is over a decade im the making so I want it to be amazing! I'm located in Isanti County but I'm willing to drive basically anywhere! We have a couple of things planned so far but nothing crazy yet and not much is truly set in stone. I'd love to hear some of your favorite places to go and events you know of/enjoy happening during that time frame. I have my favorites but I want to think outside of my own box, too! Some kid friendly ideas would be great, I have a 1 year old that will be with us for many of the adventures. No diet restrictions and we both drink so give me whatever!

Here's the working itinerary so far:

-MOA on arrival day to kill time during rush hour
hour

-day trip to Red Wing, Lake City, and Wabasha

-city day on the 10th: art intitute, stone arch, other touristy stuff, and a concert in the evening. Would love food and coffee rec's for this day! I've got red rabbit, eato, cosettas, kramarczuk's, and freehouse on the idea list.

-science museum for my kiddo

-Mankato day(s) trip. Gotta visit the college stomping grounds to go to mazatlan and maybe even get wasted at Rounders

TIA!! I do want to take her north somewhere too, of course. There's just so many places worthy of visiting, so I havent pinned down anything yet! I figure we might head north a couple of times or even AirBnB for a night or two.",3,1757436800.0,minnesota,1,0.71,False

A girl from uni had called me to meet her at a coffee shop because she had been locked out of her flat and the landlord were away (she was living with him). She was also dogsitting his dog in his absence.

I go meet her in the coffee shop to see how I can help. She had this super spoiled and untrained Jack Russell terrier with her. It kept barking so much that the waiters asked us to leave (although we were just about to anyway as we didn't want to annoy the customers farther). The girl was picking up her stuff and told me to hold the leash for a bit.

Suddenly, I feel a strong tug. The dog went nuts, growling and barking its lungs out and charging towards a little girl passing by. Thankfully, I had a strong hold on the leash and pulled it back quickly. 

I don't even want to imagine how this could have ended. First for the poor little girl. And also me getting in legal trouble just because I held someone's untrained, unstable dog for literally a few seconds.

1) I have no idea how John being a civil engineer would link to his ability to be able to create all of the ingenious things that he creates. Civil engineers typically specialise in individual sectors or roles (sectors being like, highways, rail, hydraulics, structures, and roles being designer, contractor, client) and NONE OF THOSE SECTORS would necessitate a need to engineer anything nearly as complex as something like the reverse bear trap. Although John does indeed possess all of the arrogance of your average senior design engineer (I‚Äôm a senior design engineer so I‚Äôm allowed to say that.) Honestly the role of a machinist, mechanical engineer or a position in industrial product development would make sense for him. But I guess those are all a bit too obvious - no one really knows what a civil engineer does (I did not when I applied to become one) 

2) An architect and a civil engineer are extremely different jobs. The phrase ‚Äúan architects dream is a civil engineers nightmare‚Äù is commonplace! From what I‚Äôm aware (I work in highways, forgive my ignorance) architects design the building and civil engineers (structural engineers, more specifically) do the math to make sure it stays standing up - which can be hard if the architect has drawn the leaning tower of pisa. They work in tandem. Architects are extremely skilled but they definitely do very different things!

3) The idea of any building in existence being ‚ÄúJohns first building‚Äù is hilarious, I enjoy it a lot. A single building will require input from many consultants to facilitate design and construction, and each consultancy will have teams of engineers working on each part. Junior staff will produce deliverables, senior staff will check and issue, revisions will be made over time. The only way that John could potentially have a ‚Äúfirst‚Äù building is if he worked his way up the ranks and maybe was the project manager for the development on behalf of the designer, or contractor. But even then it‚Äôs his company‚Äôs design, not his. Unless he has his own company. But then if he was so high up the chain of management as to be managing a company or the development of an entire building, he should NOT have had all that free time to invest in learning how to build murder machines. With the implication being that he has been the head of *multiple* building designs, he‚Äôs probably spent years of his life stressed out of his god damn mind, sending emails to contractors at 02:24 arguing over compensation event claims. Plus he spends so much time murdering people for having unhealthy coping mechanisms like drugs or SH, but man I bet he wasn‚Äôt coping with the stress of producing an ENTIRE BUILDING by journaling or undertaking regular exercise!!!! Hypocrite. 

4) ‚ÄúNew Civil Engineer‚Äù is the name of the engineering magazine published nationally in the UK and I am planning on designing a copy of it with John Kramer‚Äôs face on the front, to keep on my coffee table. No one else in my life knows anything about civil engineering or the saw franchise, so this will be a joke that will facilitate alone, and that only I will enjoy. I would also enthusiastically send a copy of this to James and Chelsea to say thank u for blessing my summer, but I don‚Äôt know if they have a PO box or anything like that (and I am in England, so‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt really bring it to a convention!)

Anyway all that to say I‚Äôve loved the Saw franchise since I was a teenager and I will sorely miss (and likely occasionally rewatch) all of hot saw summer. ",8,1757436587.0,deadmeatjames,0,1.0,False

This cleverly produced video faking psychokinesis reflects our culture‚Äôs superficial fascination with psychic phenomenon.¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3_M)

Viewing this elaborate hoax with a special effects crew gives me cause to discuss the theme of psychic ability among contactees. On several occasions I witnessed psychokinesis carried out by a fellow volunteer contact worker that I call ""Misha."" We worked together from 1993 till 1997.

There is a broad spectrum of contact experiences. On one extreme you have a simple sighting. Many people believe that these are random events, but in my judgment, they are not. I am of the opinion that even simple sightings are staged or programed events. I strongly suspect that flying saucer intelligences probably have a consciousness link with every ‚ÄúUFO perceiver."" I imagine that this is hard for most people to accept. It certainly was so for me. It took years of volunteering in networks of activists that I call ‚Äúthe contact underground‚Äù to lead me to this assessment.

On the other extreme, there are those individuals that I label ""prime contactees."" They are the same kind of contact experiencers who are being called ‚Äúpsionic assets.‚Äù These remarkable individuals are usually trained to attract UFOs during psychic interactions with the so-called ""ETs"". This process often starts from childhood, adolescence or early adulthood and they can exhibit unusual parapsychological talents. Direct telepathic communications with UFO intelligences can be one of them. Misha, I strongly suspect, had this. However when I asked him about it, he usually responded with enigmatic statement like ""I can't talk about it. It‚Äôs not safe."" And then he clamed up and refused to say anything more.

Another talent that prime contactees can have is¬†¬†psychokinesis. While driving with Misha to a contact research site in the Mohave Desert in May of 1994, we had a dispute. I had just purchased a used 1991 Isuzu 4-wheel-drive Trooper. We were on a power line dirt road just a few miles from the perimeter of Fort Irwin near Highway 15. Power lines were over us as we bounced along a rocky path that had been bulldozed across a rugged desert landscape.¬†

Misha wanted me to engage the 4-wheel drive mechanism, but I was steering and deemed it not necessarily as we were making good progress without it. We argued this point for a few minutes when suddenly the lever controlling the 4-wheel drive ON ITS OWN moved into position. The display panel lit up and we were in 4-wheel drive. No one had touched the lever. It had been under my continuous observation as Misha and I were talking.¬†

When I purchased the vehicle, I was told by the owner that the only way I could safely engage the 4-wheel-drive mechanism was to stop the car, back up to lock the tires into 4-wheel drive mode, and then and only then move the lever forward into place. An Isuzu dealer's mechanic asserted that it was impossible for the mechanism to spontaneously on its own go into gear without carrying out the prescribed procedure. Misha was as surprised as I was when this happened, but he indeed wanted us to be in 4-wheel-drive and that's what happened. One two other occasions he used his apparent psychokinetic powers to accomplish other tasks. In one of those examples, he was able apparently able to move an object¬†¬†that was about 100 feet away.

I ask fellow contact experiencers to please share their personal accounts of apparent psychokinetic phenomenon that they have witnessed.",1,1757436577.0,CE5,0,0.56,False
1nco62n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1nco62n/assess_the_best_coffee_maker_performance_with/,Assess the Best Coffee Maker Performance with Keurig K-Duo Review,"Testing the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition gave me an interesting mix of excitement and curiosity. Its ability to serve as both a single-serve coffee maker and a carafe brewer was the kind of versatility my kitchen had been screaming for. With the need for both quick personal cups and larger gatherings in mind, I was eager to explore every inch of what this machine had to offer. The silver finish? A sleek addition to my countertop that never failed to catch the eye of guests. I could already tell this wasn‚Äôt just about looks‚Äîperformance was where this coffee machine aimed to shine.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the aesthetics had a modern elegance. The silver finish wasn‚Äôt just stylish; it added a professional touch to my kitchen setup. The compact size, despite being multi-functional, is surprisingly well-thought-out. Having it at 12.76 x 10.94 x 12.92 inches meant it fit snugly on my counter without overcrowding, though I did have to make a little extra space due to its height. That being said, its 12.51-pound weight makes it solid and durable without feeling cumbersome. The included glass carafe, complete with a metallic handle, felt sturdy and paired well with the heating plate to keep my coffee hot for hours.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

The dual functionality of this coffee maker is its winning attribute. Whether I was in the mood for a quick K-Cup pod brew or wanted a full carafe using ground coffee, the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition made switching between these modes an absolute breeze. The buttons were clearly labeled, so I didn‚Äôt struggle to figure out how to use the numerous functions. The shared 60-ounce water reservoir added massive convenience. I didn‚Äôt have to refill constantly, even when alternating between brewing a single cup and a 12-cup carafe‚Äîa small win that adds up considerably over countless mornings.

[Check Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b095xdqpzc/)

**Performance**

Testing out the multiple brew sizes was a joy, and I appreciated how simple it was to switch between them. You can choose from 6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces for a single cup or the same increments for a carafe. The ‚ÄúStrong Brew‚Äù button quickly became my favorite for mornings when I needed a bolder, richer cup of coffee. And yes, the auto-brew feature for the carafe lived up to the hype. Being able to program it up to 24 hours in advance meant I could wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee‚Äîa small luxury I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I had it.

**Highlights**

- Brew a single cup or a full carafe for larger needs  
- Strong brew feature for more intense flavors  
- Sleek silver aesthetic that fits seamlessly into any kitchen  
- 60-ounce shared water reservoir, minimizing frequent refills  
- Simple and intuitive controls for effortless operation  

**Downsides**

While there‚Äôs plenty to love about this coffee maker, I did notice a few areas for improvement. The glass carafe, although aesthetically pleasing, does require patience with pouring as it‚Äôs a little prone to dripping if the angle isn‚Äôt right. The heating plate was effective, but it didn‚Äôt seem to keep the coffee piping hot after an extended time. Additionally, the machine is slightly on the noisy side during operation, particularly when brewing a carafe. It‚Äôs nothing unbearable, but lighter sleepers in my household definitely took notice.

**Shortcomings**

- Dripping issues when pouring from the carafe if not angled carefully  
- Heating plate could do better at maintaining higher temperatures  
- Brewing process emits noticeable noise, especially with carafes  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this to a few other dual-function machines, the obvious rival is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While the Hamilton Beach model offers similar single-serve and carafe features, the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition has the edge in terms of design. Its sleek silver finish and robust build feel more premium than its competitors. On the other hand, the FlexBrew‚Äôs reusable filter offers a bit more eco-friendliness, though it lacks the polished programming options like the auto-brew and Smart Start features. Another contender, the Ninja DualBrew, did impress with its speed and temperature consistency, but the Keurig‚Äôs wider compatibility with K-Cups and ground coffee pulls ahead for anyone who thrives on variety.

**Price Performance**

Evaluating its price against its features, this machine delivers solid value. With programmable brewing, multiple size options, and dual functionality, you‚Äôre essentially getting two coffee machines in one. The fact that it combines advanced brewing technology with user-friendly controls makes it an excellent investment for households with diverse coffee preferences. While the upfront cost may seem like a commitment, the long-term utility and convenience quickly balance things out for me.

1nco4jz,https://i.redd.it/o4nxhrl546of1.png,"[POEM] Why we published Brian O'Sullivan's ""Reentry"" today.","Hi everyone! Hope you‚Äôre having a nice start to September. Today I‚Äôm excited to share why I picked Brian O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs poem, ‚ÄúReentry,‚Äù for the prompt poem of the month. This particular poem was written for my prompt on August 10th: ‚ÄúWrite a sonnet in which someone sings.‚Äù

Why did I come up with this prompt? I was inspired by the abundant birdsong I was hearing constantly in early August here in The Woodlands. Plus, I often think about the fact that the entomology of ‚Äúsonnet‚Äù goes back to the Italian ‚Äúsonetto‚Äù which means ‚Äúlittle song.‚Äù My goal in the prompt was to have poets write towards sound by nature of the requirement to have someone singing.

Not surprisingly, most of the prompt poems (including my own that week) referenced the singing as emitting from birds. Brian‚Äôs singing being himself alone in a car stood out in that way‚Äîthough that isn‚Äôt why I picked it.

The reality of combing through so many poems (in reading submissions) is that, when I happen upon one that I am enjoying, a silent prayer erupts. ‚ÄúPlease let this go somewhere,‚Äù I inevitably think. All too often, even otherwise well-written poems forget that a poem is a journey. They leave me at the station.

Brian‚Äôs poem begins with the kind of straightforward narrative that feels like a friend launching into an anecdote. This is where the promise of a short poem comes in. We can see that this is going to be a short ‚Äústory,‚Äù and become eager to get to the point. Every poem is a written contract to provide an ending.

As the story builds and nears the visible end, the intensity of the rhyme does as well. Eventually hitting us with the ‚ÄúTom‚Äù / ‚ÄúBomb‚Äù full-on loud rhyme, that in my deepest reading can be seen as an ill-fated o-ring reference. This is the heart of why I love this poem‚Äîthe sounds of language being indicative of the climax, despite the fact that not much really changes in the story until the last line.

Most of the r/Poetry is probably aware that the volta‚Äìturn at the end of a sonnet‚Äìusually comes with the last couplet. This seems like a good excuse to talk about one of my favorite poems of all time:



Sonnet 18



Shall I compare thee to a summer‚Äôs day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer‚Äôs lease hath all too short a date.

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature‚Äôs changing course, untrimmed;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow‚Äôst,

Nor shall death brag thou wand‚Äôrest in his shade,

When in eternal lines to Time thou grow‚Äôst.

¬†So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

¬†So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

  


*‚ÄîShakespeare*



Here, the volta is a temporal shift that gets to the heart of why that poem mattered‚Äìthe purpose is to immortalize the subject of the poem. It also shows the expectation of the sonnet with the volta represented in the last two lines.

However, in Brian‚Äôs poem, the penultimate line is not part of the volta. Just when readers (and at least one editor) became concerned that this otherwise fine poem would break the contract of the form, we are hit with the last line of the poem that, in a flash, answers why the story of the poem was significant.

I am a very light-handed editor, as is all of *Rattle*. Perhaps this is admitting too much, but if I were a heavy-handed editor, a lot of/perhaps most published poems have some aspect I would change if it were my poem. But of course, they are not my poems!¬†

In this case, Brian submitted the poem with the title ‚ÄúLong Island Oddity,‚Äù alluding to the David Bowie song and then also to make a little joke about geography in that area that I admitted went a little over my head! Anyone that listens to my (independent from *Rattle*) podcast, *The Poetry Space\_*, is probably familiar with my frequent thoughts on titles. The most important is that I think contemporary poetry doesn‚Äôt take them seriously enough, and it is a missed opportunity to think of titles as labels. I have a whole episode about it! [Billy Collins on our show did too](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-poetry-space/id1675796320?i=1000724061574)!

I suggested the title ‚ÄúReentry‚Äù to Brian, making it clear that it would still be the winning poem even if he elected not to change the title. I came up with it by searching through space-shuttle-related jargon that would have a meaning transformed by this particular poem, and hint at what was potentially ahead without giving anything away. I‚Äôm glad that Brian agreed.¬†

Also wanted to note that Brian is in fact on *The Poetry Space\_* squad, which I invited him to join around a year ago because he is so hardworking and insightful‚Äìas well as a great poet. In fact, Brian submitted to the prompt series category 109 times before this win. That means he may have never missed a week submitting a poem since I started writing the prompts. As Brian said during the live reveal on the Rattlecast last night, finding a community that helps inspire you to put in the work of being a poet is so important. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.

Hope you all enjoyed this beautiful sonnet and use it as an excuse to enjoy singing a little song to yourself. And [please give Brian a few ‚Äúrattles‚Äù directly on his poem here](https://www.rattle.com/reentry-by-brian-osullivan).¬†

We were talking about the city and I mentioned I‚Äôd just moved into this flat I really love.
He smirked and goes, ‚ÄúWow, must be nice having a rich daddy.‚Äù
I kind of laughed because‚Ä¶ what? 

Then I said, ‚ÄúUh no, I pay my own rent.‚Äù 
And he goes, ‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶ or maybe you‚Äôve just got a generous older boyfriend.‚Äù with this stupid little grin.
I just said nope.
Finished my coffee, told him I didn‚Äôt think this was going to work, and left.

Later he texted me saying I clearly have ‚Äúno sense of humor‚Äù and that I‚Äôd ‚Äúnever survive dating in the real world.‚Äù

- I would‚Äôve gotten my Whoop at the beginning (free trial for first 30 days so low financial commitment). I would‚Äôve told myself to keep an eye on my heart rate, stress levels, etc.

- I have had or developed POTS during this. This is entirely self diagnosed, admittedly. All the signs are there though (over 30 bpm when standing up, dizziness, light headed, etc.) My Whoop helped with this so I got compression socks, a cane, etc. 

- For vertigo: you may have it if you hear ringing in one ear. Worth doing a vertigo exercise just in case! It‚Äôll also help with the dizziness. 

- Bland, bland food including organic, fortified protein shakes(this will help with anemia and b12), electrolytes with prebiotics. Eat A LOT with antibiotics (I.e. chips and protein shake). Consume some natural probiotic food 2.5 hours after antibiotics (plain kefir and sauerkraut was my go to). Throat coat tea in the afternoon, green tea in the morning. Don‚Äôt overeat, that coffee is also not worth the pain!

- I also developed oral thrush so keep an eye on that tongue! Get a thrush rinse if you see it/ do salt water rinses 4x a day. This will help so much with nausea as well. 

- Tylenol to manage fevers and mild nervousness (no more than 4 extra strength a day)! Lots of ice packs to stay cool. To manage emotional health: meditate, rest A LOT, gentle walks, manage work and personal expectations by sharing what‚Äôs going on, ask for support!!

1nco35g,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1nco35g/how_to_hide_your_ip_address/,How To Hide Your IP Address,"Every 39 seconds, someone's digital identity gets compromised online. Your IP address? It's the digital breadcrumb trail leading straight to you‚Äîand trust me, you don't want the wrong people following it.

Here's what might surprise you: 92% of Americans worry about their online privacy, and 76% say companies should do more to protect their data. Yet most people still browse the web completely exposed, broadcasting their location and activities to anyone who cares to look.

I've been testing cybersecurity solutions for years, and I can tell you this‚Äîhiding your IP address isn't just for privacy enthusiasts anymore. It's become essential digital hygiene. Whether you're working from a coffee shop, trying to access your favorite shows while traveling, or simply want to keep advertisers from building a detailed profile of your life, masking your IP is one of the smartest moves you can make online.

# What Your IP Address Actually Reveals (And Why You Should Care)

Think of your IP address as your home's street address, but for the internet. Every device connected to the web gets one‚Äîyour laptop, phone, even that smart TV you forgot was recording your viewing habits.

But here's the thing most people don't realize: your IP address is basically a digital fingerprint that reveals way more than you'd expect.

**Your approximate location** gets pinpointed within a few miles. I tested this myself‚Äîtyped my IP into an online lookup tool and boom, there was my city, zip code, and even my internet provider. Creepy? Absolutely.

**Your online activities** become trackable. Websites log your IP with every visit, building profiles of your interests, browsing patterns, and even when you're most active online. Think of IP addresses like mailing addresses for devices. They tell your Internet Service Provider, would-be hackers, and websites your devices' approximate locations and could give away more information about your online activity.

**Your digital vulnerability** increases dramatically. If someone gets your IP address, they can send spam, track location, restrict services, execute DDoS attacks, or even impersonate you for illegal activities. That's not fear-mongering‚Äîthat's documented reality from cybersecurity researchers.

And the legal implications? Privacy laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), consider online identifiers like IP addresses to be personal data. Your IP isn't just some random number‚Äîit's legally recognized as personal information that deserves protection.

# Method 1: VPN (Your Digital Invisibility Cloak)

A VPN is hands-down the most reliable way to hide your IP address. I know, I know‚Äîeveryone talks about VPNs these days. But there's a reason they're everywhere: they actually work.

**How VPNs Hide Your IP:** When you connect to a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server. Your internet traffic flows through this tunnel, and websites only see the VPN server's IP address instead of yours. It's like having a trusted friend receive your mail and forward it to you‚Äînobody knows your real address.

**The VPN Advantage:**

* **Complete IP masking**: Your real IP becomes invisible to everyone
* **Military-grade encryption**: Your data gets scrambled beyond recognition
* **Global server access**: Choose your virtual location from dozens of countries
* **All-device protection**: One subscription typically covers multiple devices

**Step-by-Step VPN Setup:**

1. Research reputable providers (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark top most professional lists)
2. Choose a subscription plan (monthly if you're testing, annual for better value)
3. Download the app for your device
4. Create your account and log in
5. Select a server location
6. Hit connect‚Äîyou're now browsing with a hidden IP

**Reality Check:** Not all VPNs are created equal. If you want to mask your internet traffic with a VPN, it's better to opt for a paid option to ensure security. Free VPNs may lack some of the necessary security features, and the premium providers such as NordVPN or SurfShark often include independent audits that ensure their no-logs policies and user privacy.

**When VPNs Shine:**

* Streaming geo-blocked content (hello, international Netflix libraries)
* Secure browsing on public WiFi
* Torrenting with privacy protection
* General everyday browsing privacy

**VPN Limitations:**

* Monthly subscription costs ($3-15 depending on the provider)
* Potential speed reduction (though top providers minimize this)
* Some streaming services actively block VPN traffic

# Method 2: Proxy Servers (The Budget-Friendly Option)

Proxy servers offer a middle ground between free and comprehensive protection. They act as intermediaries between your device and the internet, similar to VPNs but with some key differences.

**How Proxies Work:** Proxy servers act as an intermediary between your computer and the internet. Websites will only see the IP address of the proxy server, rather than your real IP address.

**Types of Proxies:**

* **HTTP Proxies**: Work only with web browsing
* **HTTPS Proxies**: Add encryption for web traffic
* **SOCKS Proxies**: Handle various types of internet traffic
* **Residential Proxies**: Use real home IP addresses (harder to detect)

**Quick Proxy Setup for Browsers:**

*For Chrome:*

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí System ‚Üí Open proxy settings
2. Under ""Manual proxy setup,"" toggle ""Use a proxy server"" on
3. Enter the proxy address and port number
4. Save and restart your browser

*For Firefox:*

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Network Settings ‚Üí Settings
2. Select ""Manual proxy configuration""
3. Enter proxy details for HTTP and HTTPS
4. Click OK to apply

**Proxy Pros:**

* Often cheaper than VPNs
* Good for specific tasks like web scraping
* Can be faster than VPNs for simple browsing
* Many free options available

**Proxy Cons:**

* Some proxies aren't encrypted, so they can be used to bypass website blocks, but your website requests will still go to a third-party DNS server that can see your real IP address
* Only protect specific applications, not your entire connection
* Free proxies can be unreliable and potentially unsafe
* Less comprehensive privacy protection than VPNs

# Method 3: Tor Browser (Maximum Anonymity, Minimum Speed)

Tor takes IP hiding to the extreme. If VPNs are like having a personal bodyguard, Tor is like disappearing into a crowd of identical people all wearing masks.

**How Tor Works:** TOR is open-source software that enables anonymous communication. Using TOR is a suitable solution to hide your IP address entirely. To put it simply, your traffic is directed through a bunch of different servers before reaching the targeted website.

The Tor network routes your traffic through multiple encrypted layers (hence ""The Onion Router""), making it extremely difficult to trace back to you.

**Getting Started with Tor:**

1. Visit the official Tor Project website
2. Download the Tor Browser (it's free)
3. Install like any regular browser
4. Open and start browsing‚Äîyour IP is automatically hidden

**When to Use Tor:**

* Maximum anonymity requirements
* Accessing blocked websites in restricted countries
* Sensitive research or journalism
* General privacy when speed isn't crucial

**Tor Trade-offs:**

* However, this solution can noticeably slow down your internet connection
* Some websites block Tor traffic
* Not suitable for streaming or downloading large files
* Be cautious when using the Tor network because it has no shortage of scams, phishing sites, and malware, all designed to trick new users

# Method 4: Mobile Networks and Public WiFi (Quick Fixes)

Sometimes you need a quick IP change without installing anything. Your mobile network can be surprisingly effective for this.

**Mobile Hotspot Method:** When you connect to a mobile network on your smartphone, tablet, or Wi-Fi dongle, that network's operator immediately assigns an IP address to your device. If you were relying on a static Wi-Fi connection before, this switch will effectively hide your previous IP address.

**Steps:**

1. Enable mobile hotspot on your phone
2. Connect your other devices to this hotspot
3. Your devices now use your phone's mobile IP instead of your home IP

**Public WiFi Option:** Connecting to coffee shop or library WiFi changes your IP to theirs. But here's the crucial warning: using public Wi-Fi without security measures such as a VPN may be unsafe and unreliable. Criminals can potentially intercept your data on unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots or even set up fake hotspots to compromise your mobile device upon connection.

**Use Cases:**

* Quick IP change for accessing geo-blocked content
* Temporary solution when your main connection has issues
* Emergency access when other methods aren't available

**Major Limitations:**

* Mobile data usage can get expensive quickly
* Public WiFi security risks are substantial
* Not a long-term privacy solution

# Method 5: Cloudflare Tunnel (For the Tech-Savvy)

The tunnel works by creating an outbound-only connection from your local server to Cloudflare's network, thereby masking your public IP address from anyone remotely accessing your service. Instead of connecting directly to your IP, users connect to a Cloudflare-managed domain, and Cloudflare routes the traffic securely to your servers.

This method is specifically for people running services from their home or private networks‚Äîthink home servers, development environments, or self-hosted applications.

**When Cloudflare Tunnel Makes Sense:**

* You're hosting websites or services from home
* You need secure remote access to your home network
* You're a developer testing applications
* You want enterprise-level security without the enterprise budget

**Important Note:** While Cloudflare Tunnel doesn't hide your device's IP when browsing the web like a VPN does, it's a great option for reverse proxying traffic and maintaining privacy when hosting services from home or a private network.

# Which Method Should You Choose?

Here's my honest recommendation based on different use cases:

**For Most People: Premium VPN** If you want comprehensive protection that ""just works,"" invest in a quality VPN service. The combination of security, ease of use, and reliable performance makes it worth the monthly cost.

**For Budget-Conscious Users: Free VPN + Proxy Combo** ProtonVPN: 1 simultaneous device connection, servers in 3 countries (the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan). Windscribe: 10GB of free data, servers in 10 countries (including the U.S., Canada, the UK). Hide.me: 10GB of free data, eight server locations. Use these for basic protection, then add proxy servers for specific tasks.

**For Maximum Privacy: Tor + VPN** Layer Tor over a VPN connection for the highest level of anonymity. It's overkill for most people, but essential if you're dealing with sensitive information.

**For Quick Fixes: Mobile Networks** Perfect when you just need to quickly change your apparent location or bypass a simple IP-based restriction.

# Testing Your IP Protection

Before you assume you're protected, verify that your methods actually work:

1. **Check your current IP**: Visit whatismyipaddress .com and note your location
2. **Connect to your chosen method** (VPN, proxy, etc.)
3. **Refresh the IP checker**: Your location should show the server's location, not yours
4. **Test for leaks**: Use tools like ipleak .net to check for DNS leaks or other exposures

It makes sense to make a note of your IP address before and after you've tried one of the methods listed above. If you're testing a VPN, check your IP address by using our online tool. You can also Google 'what's my IP?' Next, connect to the VPN server location that you'd like to get a new IP address from.

# The Real Threats You're Protecting Against

Understanding what you're defending against helps you choose the right level of protection. SpyCloud's total collection of recaptured data grew 22% in the past year, from 43.7 billion to 53.3 billion distinct identity records, highlighting the vast scale of stolen data available to attackers.

**Current Threat Landscape:**

* The cost of cybercrime is anticipated to reach USD 10.5 trillion annually by the end of 2025
* Personal customer information (such as names, email addresses, and passwords) is included in 44% of data breaches
* 74% of recaptured consumer records contain a physical or IP address

**What Attackers Do With IP Addresses:**

* Build detailed profiles for targeted attacks
* Launch denial-of-service attacks against your connection
* Attempt to gain unauthorized access to your home network
* Sell your information on dark web marketplaces
* Use your IP for illegal activities, potentially implicating you

# Common Mistakes That Leave You Exposed

I've seen people think they're protected when they're actually broadcasting their real IP. Avoid these critical errors:

**Assuming Incognito Mode Helps**: Using an incognito mode in a browser doesn't hide your IP address, so your IP address is visible to websites and messengers you use online.

**Using Sketchy Free Services**: Many free VPNs actually log and sell your data‚Äîthe opposite of protection.

**Forgetting About DNS Leaks**: Your VPN might hide your IP, but if your DNS requests leak, your browsing history is still exposed.

**Not Covering All Devices**: Protecting your laptop while leaving your phone, tablet, and smart TV exposed defeats the purpose.

# The Bottom Line

Your IP address is more valuable than you probably realize. 81% of users say the potential risks they face from companies collecting data outweigh the benefits, yet most people do nothing to protect this crucial piece of personal information.

You don't need to become a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself. Pick one method from this guide‚Äîpreferably a reputable VPN service‚Äîand implement it consistently. The few minutes you spend setting up protection today could save you from becoming another statistic in next year's data breach reports.

Your digital privacy matters. And now you know exactly how to protect it.

**Ready to get started?** Test your current IP exposure right now, then choose the protection method that fits your needs and budget. Your more secure online life is just a few clicks away.

*Remember: Hiding your IP address is legal. However, VPNs, proxies, and other methods of changing your IP may be illegal in some countries. If you suspect that you might get in trouble for using them, do your research beforehand. When in doubt, consult local regulations or legal counsel.*",1,1757436381.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

This cleverly produced video faking psychokinesis reflects our culture‚Äôs superficial fascination with psychic phenomenon.¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3_M)

Viewing this elaborate hoax with a special effects crew gives me cause to discuss the theme of psychic ability among contactees. On several occasions I witnessed psychokinesis carried out by a fellow volunteer contact worker that I call ""Misha."" We worked together from 1993 till 1997.

There is a broad spectrum of contact experiences. On one extreme you have a simple sighting. Many people believe that these are random events, but in my judgment, they are not. I am of the opinion that even simple sightings are staged or programed events. I strongly suspect that flying saucer intelligences probably have a consciousness link with every ‚ÄúUFO perceiver."" I imagine that this is hard for most people to accept. It certainly was so for me. It took years of volunteering in networks of activists that I call ‚Äúthe contact underground‚Äù to lead me to this assessment.

On the other extreme, there are those individuals that I label ""prime contactees."" They are the same kind of contact experiencers who are being called ‚Äúpsionic assets.‚Äù These remarkable individuals are usually trained to attract UFOs during psychic interactions with the so-called ""ETs"". This process often starts from childhood, adolescence or early adulthood and they can exhibit unusual parapsychological talents. Direct telepathic communications with UFO intelligences can be one of them. Misha, I strongly suspect, had this. However when I asked him about it, he usually responded with enigmatic statement like ""I can't talk about it. It‚Äôs not safe."" And then he clamed up and refused to say anything more.

Another talent that prime contactees can have is¬†¬†psychokinesis. While driving with Misha to a contact research site in the Mohave Desert in May of 1994, we had a dispute. I had just purchased a used 1991 Isuzu 4-wheel-drive Trooper. We were on a power line dirt road just a few miles from the perimeter of Fort Irwin near Highway 15. Power lines were over us as we bounced along a rocky path that had been bulldozed across a rugged desert landscape.¬†

Misha wanted me to engage the 4-wheel drive mechanism, but I was steering and deemed it not necessarily as we were making good progress without it. We argued this point for a few minutes when suddenly the lever controlling the 4-wheel drive ON ITS OWN moved into position. The display panel lit up and we were in 4-wheel drive. No one had touched the lever. It had been under my continuous observation as Misha and I were talking.¬†

When I purchased the vehicle, I was told by the owner that the only way I could safely engage the 4-wheel-drive mechanism was to stop the car, back up to lock the tires into 4-wheel drive mode, and then and only then move the lever forward into place. An Isuzu dealer's mechanic asserted that it was impossible for the mechanism to spontaneously on its own go into gear without carrying out the prescribed procedure. Misha was as surprised as I was when this happened, but he indeed wanted us to be in 4-wheel-drive and that's what happened. One two other occasions he used his apparent psychokinetic powers to accomplish other tasks. In one of those examples, he was able apparently able to move an object¬†¬†that was about 100 feet away.

I‚Äôm looking to start up a **Forged in the Dark** game here in Vancouver. If you don‚Äôt know it, it‚Äôs a narrative-first system (similar to Powered by the Apocalypse) that focuses on fast-paced, improvisational storytelling. I‚Äôll be setting it in **Numenera‚Äôs 9th World** ‚Äî a far-future Earth full of strange discoveries, ancient ruins, and people just trying to make sense of it all.

The idea is to run an **open table sandbox**: players can come and go without committing to a long campaign (though sticking around is always welcome!). I‚Äôll also run a parallel Discord where off-screen activities (crafting, downtime, settlement building, etc.) can unfold, so we can keep game sessions focused on the action and story at the table.

**Quick details:**

* First, we‚Äôll meet for coffee/tea to chat TTRPGs and see if we vibe.
* Then I‚Äôll run a few one-shots to test the table.
* Semi-regular (\~every 2 weeks) games at my place in **Mt. Pleasant**.
* Narrative/improv heavy, light on mechanics, full of discovery and overcoming odds.
* 18+ only. All orientations/identities welcome. Leave your drama at the door.

**About me:** I‚Äôm 36 (he/him), been DMing/playing TTRPGs for years. Started with D&D but quickly fell in love with narrative-first systems. My last long-term campaign was **Blades in the Dark**, which ran for just over a year before wrapping this summer.

If this sounds fun, DM me with:

* A bit about yourself + your TTRPG experience.
* What you‚Äôre looking for in a tabletop game.
* And just for fun: your favorite weird artifact, creature, or discovery you‚Äôd want to see in the 9th World.

Yesterday, I watched my N8N browser agent research 50 competitor websites, extract pricing data, and create a perfect spreadsheet.

In 15 minutes.

The same task used to take my team an entire day.

This N8N browser agent doesn't get tired. Doesn't make mistakes. Doesn't complain about boring work.

It just executes. Perfectly. Every time.

Let me show you how to build your own digital workforce with N8N browser agent technology.

# üéØ Why N8N Browser Agent Technology Changes Everything

Most business owners are stuck in the stone age of manual work.

Copying data from websites by hand. Filling out forms one by one. Checking competitor prices manually. Researching prospects individually.

All while their smart competitors deploy N8N browser agent systems that do this work automatically.

The gap is widening every day.

This N8N browser agent technology isn't just an efficiency improvement. It's a complete paradigm shift in how work gets done.

Think about it. Your N8N browser agent can visit 100 websites while you drink your morning coffee. It can extract contact information from business directories while you sleep. It can monitor competitor pricing while you're on vacation.

The businesses that master N8N browser agent automation will have infinite advantages over those still doing everything manually.

# üí° N8N Browser Agent Use Cases That Blow Minds

# üìä N8N Browser Agent ROI Analysis

Let me break down the real financial impact of N8N browser agent implementation.

**Manual Work Elimination**  
Average business owner spends 15 hours weekly on repetitive browser tasks. N8N browser agent systems reduce this to 1 hour of setup and monitoring.

**Cost Reduction Calculations**  
At $50/hour value of time, that's $750 weekly savings. $39,000 annually. From a system that costs $0 to set up with free tiers.

**Productivity Multiplication**  
N8N browser agents work 24/7 without breaks. One automation can replace 3-5 full-time manual workers for specific tasks.

**Accuracy Improvements**  
Human error rates for data entry: 3-5%. N8N browser agent error rates: Less than 0.1%. Better data quality leads to better business decisions.

**Scalability Benefits**  
Hire a human: $40,000+ annually plus benefits. Deploy an N8N browser agent: $50-200 monthly maximum at scale. Infinite scalability without hiring.

The ROI on N8N browser agent technology is immediate and compounds over time.

1ncnruy,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrucker/comments/1ncnruy/year_one_anniversary/,YEAR ONE ANNIVERSARY,"Hey all!

How crazy is this? Star Trucker has officially turned 1! It‚Äôs been one hell of a year for the game (and us Monsters) and we‚Äôre incredibly grateful to everyone for the input and support since launch. We wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep rollin‚Äô out updates without you. Thanks ‚ô°

As part of the celebrations we‚Äôve got a bunch of treats lined up for you this month but to kick things off let‚Äôs have a quick recap before we dive into the contents of our One Year Anniversary update.

# A Year in Recap

I‚Äôll keep this short as some of you are well aware of what‚Äôs rolled out since the initial launch but for those new to the game check out this mini recap and anniversary montage put together by our publisher Raw Fury‚Ä¶

* Custom Game Settings
* Freeplay Mode ‚Ä¢ Sleeping
* Parking Tickets
* Mid-Session Difficulty Adjuster
* Seasonal Holograms
* Improved Damage Calculations
* Reward boosts|

Despite being a small team we‚Äôve tried our best to listen to the community. Keeping an eye on internal priorities while rolling out new features, quality of life improvements and a host balance changes. We‚Äôve also been hard at work on a bunch of new content we look forward to chatting about soon!

Until then, let‚Äôs get you all up to speed on the latest update‚Ä¶

# PC Peripheral Support

It‚Äôs been a long time coming but our initial implementation of peripheral support is finally rolling out as part of the Anniversary update. This will allow you to play with multiple connected devices from joysticks and throttles to wheels and pedals.

It might take some tweaking to get the perfect settings for your setups but once you do you‚Äôll find driving a star truck using peripherals is an incredibly unique and rewarding experience!

For more information on this we‚Äôve created a handy guide to help with setup and explain some of the nuances‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¢ [**Star Trucker - Peripheral Guide & FAQ**](https://star-trucker.com/guides/peripherals-guide)

We‚Äôd also like to ask the community to lend a hand with our spreadsheet that tracks peripheral compatibility‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ [**Star Trucker - Peripheral Tracking Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19z_f-lbxQgzQ87M4tpjXOjAFcS3kEX27alN8surU7fM/edit?usp=sharing)

With so many different devices and combinations of setups in the wild it‚Äôs impossible for us to try them all ourselves. So we hope you‚Äôll help us out by submitting information regarding your devices alongside example custom binding files via our special Google submission form [**HERE**](https://forms.gle/TpEkc9bUESKAYBvW7). Once we‚Äôve confirmed a new peripheral and binding config we‚Äôll add it as a preset in a future update.

Lastly, please keep in mind that this was quite the undertaking for our tiny team and it might not be perfect straight out the warp gate but we‚Äôre super proud of how things have turned out so far and we‚Äôre excited to finally get this feature into your hands.

*Pictured : Dave‚Äôs chaotic multi-device test setup and high-risk coffee positioning*

# Speed Traps

*‚ÄúDue to the consistent disregard of highway restrictions, the DIV has had no choice but to install speed checks across key zones & sectors‚Äù*

Our speed checks are a little bit experimental but we feel they add a great bit of flavor to the world. They‚Äôre also pretty good at catching out drivers who become a little too complacent on the throttle - especially after a few speed upgrades at the garages.

https://preview.redd.it/psx563wt16of1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c116fa9c9e718752e7dd7bc159f8cb09062652f5

These speed checks have been placed as static traps in specific locations around the galaxy but in the future we might evolve them to be a bit more dynamic - gotta keep you truckers on your toes!

To complement the inclusion of speed traps we‚Äôve also added two new paint job challenges‚Ä¶

* **Trip x100 speed traps to unlock ‚ÄúSmokey Style‚Äù**

# Anniversary Treats

We‚Äôve also added a couple of treats in this build. Firstly the ‚ÄúNumber One‚Äù hood ornament you‚Äôll have seen in our anniversary thumbnails is free for all players.

Secondly the hologram projector has been enabled and updated with some virtual cake for the duration of September. The cake isn‚Äôt a lie. Honest!

https://i.redd.it/ce3c5s6826of1.gif

# Corporation Branding

Alongside everything else going on we‚Äôve been keen to update some of our generic corporations with unique logos, trailer liveries and refined color schemes.

For the Anniversary update we‚Äôve overhauled x2 corporations and their associated trailers but there will be more to come in the future.¬†

# Warp Speed Ahead

We‚Äôd like to finish up with a quick note on what‚Äôs next for Star Trucker. We‚Äôre still moving onwards with the proposed timeline [**HERE**](https://star-trucker.com/latest-news/the-road-ahead). However there‚Äôs a couple of things to update you all on‚Ä¶.

* The Job Generator optimizations and updates are looking promising but not quite ready yet. We‚Äôll roll these out in the next big update.
* A long time ago we mentioned a cargo pack DLC. This is being updated to be more than just new trailers and cargo and will roll out alongside the Business Venture update and feature a new NPC and unique rewards.
* Speaking of - the Business Venture update is now in full development and shaping up nicely. We‚Äôll be sure to write a specific dev blog on this new feature in the coming months.
* Interior Customization is also in development and lookin‚Äô pretty sweet! This is going to link up closely with the Business Venture meta and should provide lots of great new stuff to unlock.
* Peripheral presets will get an update down the line once we‚Äôve gathered and tested some more setups. Remember - If you feel you can contribute in this area please use the special Google Form [**HERE**](https://forms.gle/TpEkc9bUESKAYBvW7).

**Telekinetic Coffee Shop Surprise**

This cleverly produced video faking psychokinesis reflects our culture‚Äôs superficial fascination with psychic phenomenon.¬†

¬†

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3\_M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlOxlSOr3_M)

¬†

Viewing this elaborate hoax with a special effects crew gives me cause to discuss the theme of psychic ability among contactees. On several occasions I witnessed psychokinesis carried out by a fellow volunteer contact worker that I call ""Misha."" We worked together from 1993 till 1997.

¬†

There is a broad spectrum of contact experiences. On one extreme you have a simple sighting. Many people believe that these are random events, but in my judgment, they are not. I am of the opinion that even simple sightings are staged or programed events. I strongly suspect that flying saucer intelligences probably have a consciousness link with every ‚ÄúUFO perceiver."" I imagine that this is hard for most people to accept. It certainly was so for me. It took years of volunteering in networks of activists that I call ‚Äúthe contact underground‚Äù to lead me to this assessment.

¬†

On the other extreme, there are those individuals that I label ""prime contactees."" They are the same kind of contact experiencers who are being called ‚Äúpsionic assets.‚Äù These remarkable individuals are usually trained to attract UFOs during psychic interactions with the so-called ""ETs"". This process often starts from childhood, adolescence or early adulthood and they can exhibit unusual parapsychological talents. Direct telepathic communications with UFO intelligences can be one of them. Misha, I strongly suspect, had this. However when I asked him about it, he usually responded with enigmatic statement like ""I can't talk about it. It‚Äôs not safe."" And then he clamed up and refused to say anything more.

Another talent that prime contactees can have is¬†¬†psychokinesis. While driving with Misha to a contact research site in the Mohave Desert in May of 1994, we had a dispute. I had just purchased a used 1991 Isuzu 4-wheel-drive Trooper. We were on a power line dirt road just a few miles from the perimeter of Fort Irwin near Highway 15. Power lines were over us as we bounced along a rocky path that had been bulldozed across a rugged desert landscape.¬†

Misha wanted me to engage the 4-wheel drive mechanism, but I was steering and deemed it not necessarily as we were making good progress without it. We argued this point for a few minutes when suddenly the lever controlling the 4-wheel drive ON ITS OWN moved into position. The display panel lit up and we were in 4-wheel drive. No one had touched the lever. It had been under my continuous observation as Misha and I were talking.¬†

¬†When I purchased the vehicle, I was told by the owner that the only way I could safely engage the 4-wheel-drive mechanism was to stop the car, back up to lock the tires into 4-wheel drive mode, and then and only then move the lever forward into place. An Isuzu dealer's mechanic asserted that it was impossible for the mechanism to spontaneously on its own go into gear without carrying out the prescribed procedure. Misha was as surprised as I was when this happened, but he indeed wanted us to be in 4-wheel-drive and that's what happened. One two other occasions he used his apparent psychokinetic powers to accomplish other tasks. In one of those examples, he was able apparently able to move an object¬†¬†that was about 100 feet away.

¬†I ask fellow contact experiencers to please share their personal accounts of apparent psychokinetic phenomenon that they have witnessed.

Edit: Shipley's isn't in LA, but I keep it on the list to remind myself to try it lol

THE LIST

Donut places of note in LA that I've tried (ranked best to last):

Flour premium doughnut/Flour Fresh (S+ tier)

SK donuts

Sidecar Donuts

Colorado donuts 

The Donut Man

Paris Baguette (because of coffee cronut)

Crafted Donuts

Old ferry donuts

Trejos coffee and donuts 

California Donuts

Bob's donuts

Kettle glazed

Holy Grail donuts 

Randy's donuts 



Want to try:  

Primo donuts 

DKs donuts 

Donut friend 

Shipley's 
 

------------------

I try my best not to list big franchises in this. There are some exceptions, but Dunkin, Winchell's, Yum Yum etc is not on here. 

I, I do not bother adding many Mom and pop shops I've tried to the list when they clearly don't specialize in donuts unless they rank well. I see no point in dragging a small, family-owned business like that. 

Yes, I know The Donut Man and Holy Grail are ranked low. That is where I truly believe they deserve to be. 

Hope y'all get some new places to try out of this!

Edit #2: thank you all for all your suggestions! I'll add them to my notes app. For those wondering why ""x"" place isn't on the list anywhere, it's because I either haven't tried it or heard of it/remembered to add it. That has since been corrected! 

Edit 3: if y'all take one thing away from this list, please let it be to try Flour Premium Doughnut in the Koreatown Rodeo Galleria location. The coffee brulee, sweet potato, misugaru, and black sesame donuts are all leagues above.

THE HUMAN GOD





He didn‚Äôt mean to come here.

One floor above the library. 
Past the old locked seminar room. 

Through the broken fire door someone had wedged open with a folded chair. 

The roof.

Cold wind bit at his jaw as Kai stepped out into it. 

Concrete beneath him. 
Rusted rails around him. 

The silver edge of evening settling like a hush over the city.

Toronto‚Äôs skyline blinked and breathed far away. 

The sky was still light-but not for long.

He didn‚Äôt want to be found.
He didn‚Äôt want to be seen.

And most of all, he didn‚Äôt want to feel what he was feeling.

He walked to the edge.

Not recklessly. 
Not to jump.

Just... to look.

His hands were in his coat pockets. 

His body was hunched against the wind.

But his heart-His heart was not quiet.

He could feel it trying to burn its way out of him.

They kept saying he was special.

Sequoia said he was 

‚Äúchosen.‚Äù

Mike said,

‚Äúyou always been different, man.‚Äù

Even Jaxx-fucking, Jaxx-had looked at him last week like he was some kind of star that had come down wrong. 

Like he was glowing in the wrong places.

Kai exhaled, trying to slow the thudding in his chest.

He whispered into the empty wind:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a god.‚Äù

No one answered. 

Not even the wind.

Below, he could see students walking across campus. 

Tiny bodies with coffee cups, lovers holding hands, someone laughing so hard they bent at the waist. 

All of them real.

And him?

He felt like something unfinished. 

A page torn out of a holy book and stuffed into a jacket pocket.

Not lost. 
Not found. 

Just... waiting.

He walked to the corner where the roof‚Äôs metal caught the sky.

There, under the utility light, he saw his reflection in a fogged-up square of dark glass.

It didn‚Äôt look like him.

Or-worse-it looked too much like him.

The version he was afraid they‚Äôd all start to see.

The version the mirror already knew.

He stared at it. 
Hard.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready,‚Äù 
he said quietly.""

The mirror didn‚Äôt care.

He crouched, knees aching a little. 

Wind tugged at his sleeves. 

The warmth from the building below sent up little breath-like puffs through the vents.

Kai closed his eyes.
He let the memories in.

His mother, holding his head when he cried from the nightmares, whispering 

‚Äúbaby, your soul is too old for this world.‚Äù

Jaxx, laughing without meaning to, backlit by the gym doors, golden and flushed, voice saying

‚Äúyou‚Äôre weird as fuck, bro, but I like it.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs hands were shaking now.
Something inside him pulsed.

Not pain. 
Not yet.

But something vast. 

Something that wanted to be let out.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù 
he said softly.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be what they think I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I ruin it?‚Äù

He put a hand over his chest.

Felt the heartbeat.
Felt it skip.

And then-just once-he heard it.

Not a voice. 
Not a word.

A tone.

A resonance.

Like someone had struck a tuning fork inside his ribs.

He opened his eyes.

The sky was darker now. 

A single bird - maybe a crow - circled overhead. 
A cloud peeled open to reveal a bruised stripe of moon.

Kai stood.
He faced the mirror again.

And this time... he saw something in his own eyes that frightened him.

Not cruelty. 
Not madness.

Divinity.

That old, slow-burning fire.

The one his blood had carried through dynasties.

The one no colonizer could ever steal.

The one that had waited patiently for him to be born.

He whispered:

‚ÄúI love too much to let this break me.‚Äù

Then louder, like a vow:

‚ÄúYou can have me.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut not all at once.‚Äù

Wind surged up. 
Carried the words away.

A hum trembled through the soles of his feet.

Somewhere deep inside, an ancient door creaked open. 

He felt it.

Like bones remembering how to kneel.

Like stars remembering how to speak.

He stood at the edge one last time.

And without fanfare, without lightning, without flame, Kai chose.

Not perfection.
Not power.

But presence.

He would stay.
He would love.
He would be seen.

Even if it tore him apart.

And then - He turned, walked back toward the door, and didn‚Äôt look behind him.

Not because he didn‚Äôt care.

But because he finally believed that what was coming...was meant to meet him as he 
was.




‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã




The Tone Beneath the Silence
Toronto:



Kai lies awake in bed, hoodie on, window cracked. 

The city hums outside. 

But what keeps him still isn‚Äôt noise. 

It‚Äôs the feeling that something inside him is de-tuning.

He pulls his hand across his chest. 

Over his groin. 

Listens.

Not to thought. 

But tone.

He‚Äôs always had perfect pitch, but lately he hears undertones beneath his own breath.

A friend cried earlier that day and he felt her grief vibrating through the floor.

A stranger looked at him with envy and he didn‚Äôt feel judged, he felt‚Ä¶ pulled. 

Like someone was trying to grab his frequency and twist it.

But nothing sticks.
It‚Äôs like oil on water.

He doesn‚Äôt repel it.
He transforms it.

He just doesn‚Äôt know why.

He thinks about Jaxx and the ache returns, but it‚Äôs different now.

He doesn‚Äôt feel hungry. 

He feels like something in him is trying to remember the shape it used to hold.

Then he whispers:

‚ÄúI need to hear something older than me.‚Äù

He reaches for his backpack.

Packs the bag.
Pulls on the hoodie.

Leaves the house before the sun.



‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã



The Flame of the Ancients Awakened


Exile to the Falls



He didn‚Äôt tell anyone where he was going.

Not Aspen. 
Not Sequoia. 

Not even Mike, who always seemed to know everything before anyone spoke it.

On September the 5th, the morning of his birthday, Kai slipped out before dawn, hoodie pulled low, duffle on his shoulder, and a silence in his chest that even sleep hadn‚Äôt been able to touch. 

The city hadn‚Äôt woken yet. 

The sky was still that deep velvet blue between night and morning, the color of breath held too long.

He needed to get away.

Not to escape the party, that would come later, loud and full of them all trying to pretend they weren‚Äôt breaking apart inside. 

He wasn‚Äôt running from noise.

He was running from something quieter. 

Something deeper.

Jaxx.

That name had become an ache.
A question with no answer.

He didn‚Äôt know what it meant.

Didn‚Äôt know why that first conversation had left him trembling for days. 

Why just being around him made the air feel heavier, tighter, electric. 

Why his own eyes kept drifting, betraying him, watching Jaxx‚Äôs hands, his lips, the stretch of muscle beneath his shirt. 

He wasn‚Äôt supposed to feel this way. 

Not about a man. 
Not about him.

Not when the world needed him whole.

Needed him perfect.

Pure.

Sacred.

He‚Äôd spent his life walking the line between myth and man, light and burden. 

People expected miracles from him. 

He‚Äôd seen what happened to prophets who fell from grace. 

He couldn‚Äôt be both savior and sinner. 

Couldn‚Äôt be soft where the world needed fire.

But the fire had come anyway.

And it smelled like rain and leather and something holy that wore Jaxx‚Äôs face.

So he went where he always went when it got too loud - Niagara.

The falls had never asked anything of him.

They just roared.

The hotel rooms was cheap. 
He didn‚Äôt care. 

He dropped his bag and walked barefoot across the sticky carpet to the sliding door, cracked it open, and stepped onto the cold balcony.

He was on the Canadian side, higher up, just far enough to see the water bend and fall, disappear into mist. 

He had no words for it.

Not yet.

Not for the pressure in his chest.
Not for the ache in his groin.

Not for the strange, silent knowing that had followed him since childhood, like a song he never learned, but always remembered.

He stood barefoot on the motel balcony, hoodie off, shirt damp from the mist, city behind him, roaring eternity before him.

Niagara didn‚Äôt whisper.
It roared.

And inside that roar, Kai finally heard it.

Something was off.

Not wrong. 
Not evil. 

Just‚Ä¶ off-key.

The air around him vibrated gently, but the notes were fractured, like a chorus that had forgotten its pitch.

He furrowed his brow.

That‚Äôs when a thought slid past him, not his.

Anxiety. 
Rage. 
Shame.

He didn‚Äôt feel it, he touched it.

Like dirty laundry someone else had thrown over his shoulder.

His first instinct was to hurl it off.
But his body didn‚Äôt flinch.

It absorbed it - no, not even that.
It tuned it.

The vibration hit him and turned to light, sparkled away like dust struck by sun.

Kai blinked.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Another wave hit.

This time, smaller - someone downstairs arguing on the phone.

Guilt. 
Desperation.

He picked it up without trying.
And once again, it dissolved.

Transformed. 
Became‚Ä¶ lighter.

The realization bloomed quietly, like dawn:

‚ÄúThese things don‚Äôt stick to me.‚Äù

He pressed his palm to the balcony rail.

It hummed.

Not from the Falls.

From him.

A frequency. 

Deep. 
Pure. 

Sacred.

It didn‚Äôt push away darkness. 
It didn‚Äôt destroy it.

It changed it.

He looked out at the mist, the sky breaking open in bands of violet and gray.

‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not here to fight it,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm here to‚Ä¶ tune it?‚Äù

His DNA hummed in agreement.

He wasn‚Äôt just immune.
He was tuned differently.

Three frequencies braided beneath his skin.

One was strength.
One was sound.
One was light.

He didn‚Äôt know their names yet.

Didn‚Äôt know the faces.

Didn‚Äôt know the curse riding in the background of the song.

But he could feel it.
He‚Äôd always felt it.

Something in the world had gone flat.

People were off-pitch.
Disconnected. 

Numb. 

Shamed. 

Shrinking from their own inner rhythm.

Love had become silence.
Touch had become transaction.

Emotion had become error.

He felt it now, what his body had always known.

A field.

Not of grass.
Of resonance.

Of echo.

Something woven through every smile, every apology, every wound.

And it was sick.
Bent. 

Tilted.

Not broken, but heavily detuned.

Kai stood in the center of it, not trying to fix it.

Just being.

And the moment he accepted that, just stood tall, let the weight of his presence settle, the field shivered.

Like a string tightened.

Like a room tuning itself around a single, perfect pitch.

No fire.
No miracle.

Just return.

The mist curled around his ankles.

The air buzzed in his ribs.

And he finally felt it:

He wasn‚Äôt here to be perfect.
He was here to hold the tuning fork.

And when he stood in his truth, the whole world found its note.

He smiled.
Not in pride.

In remembrance.


The roar was everywhere now.

A voice without language. 
A force without permission.

He breathed it in. 

Let it flood him.

The pounding in his chest had followed him here. 

The ache in his groin too, low, constant, like something inside him was growing, pressing outward, searching for a form big enough to contain it. 

His joggers felt tight. 

He adjusted himself absently, trying not to notice how heavy he felt. 

How swollen. 
How unfamiliar.

He didn‚Äôt feel like himself.

Not sick. 
Not aroused.

Just‚Ä¶ too full.

Like something was coming.
And then; The wind shifted.

The mist lifted.

And the world went still.

The mist was alive.

It curled around him like breath, like smoke, like memory, too thick to be air, too real to be dream. 

It kissed his neck, slid under his shirt, traced the slope of his spine like a lover returned. 

And something in it, something ancient - recognized him.

Kai froze.

The wind changed again. 
Not a breeze - a pull.

It tugged at the base of his skull, deep behind his eyes, and lower, beneath his navel, in that aching place that had throbbed ever since Jaxx looked at him too long that first time. 

Something was moving inside him now, slow and low and coiled like a rising Phoenix.

The ground beneath his bare feet hummed.

The falls thundered louder.
And a voice, not his, spoke inside his chest:

‚ÄúYou summoned me.‚Äù

Kai staggered back against the railing. 

His heart punched the inside of his ribs.

‚ÄúWho - what - ‚Äù

‚ÄúYou asked if love was unholy.‚Äù

A crack split through his bones, not pain but pressure - like his skeleton had outgrown itself.

‚ÄúYou asked if desire was sin.‚Äù

His legs trembled. 

His joggers tightened again. 

He looked down and saw it, the outline of himself shifting.

Swelling. 

Becoming.

His cock throbbed hard and heavy, not like before - deeper.

Rooted. 

As if it had remembered something it was never allowed to be. 

The girth pulsed against the fabric, stretching it, dragging it down his thigh. 

His hands gripped the rail to keep from moaning.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for this,‚Äù Kai whispered. 

But his body was already saying yes.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

The mist thickened.

Then from within it - a form.

A warrior. 

Towering. 
Bare-chested. 

Eyes like northern sky. 

Long blond hair braided with blood. 

Skin scarred, sun-dark, carved with the runes of the old world.

Bj√∂rn.

Not in front of him. 
Inside him.

Not a ghost. 

A flame.

And that flame wanted a throne.

Kai cried out, half-ecstasy, half-terror, as the presence entered him.

Not softly.

Bj√∂rn forced himself in.
Through bone, through muscle, through cock.

He filled Kai‚Äôs thighs first, thickening them, hardening them, planting him like stone.

Then his legs - longer, more powerful, stretching until Kai stood 6‚Äô5"", his body a cathedral rising to meet the god within.

Then the core.

The chest.

The arms.

Each breath heavier, deeper, broader.

Each inch of skin alive with flame.

And then - the weight.

The blessed curse between his legs.

It dropped like a star.

His cock, once perfect, now borderline divine. 

Not obscene, but undeniable.

Heavy. 
Full. 

Hung with the memory of men who fought bare in the frost, who loved their brothers in silence, who died with their swords and lovers both in hand.

He grunted.

His joggers were soaked with mist, clinging to the shape of him - his new him. 

People down by the rail stared up, wide-eyed. 

He saw them. 
He didn‚Äôt care.

The shame was gone.

He stood tall, trembling but proud, as Bj√∂rn‚Äôs voice whispered through his ribs:

‚ÄúThis is not about cock. 

This is about kings.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is not about sin. 

This is about memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Flame twisted love into hunger. 

We were never meant to be ashamed.‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs hands moved slowly to his waist. 

He cupped himself - not with lust. 

With awe. 

The weight of it now was his blessing. 

His body a throne.

Bj√∂rn had come home.




‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè




Ancients Awakened
The Story of Bjorn


The wind stopped.

But the voice did not.

Kai stood trembling, cock swollen against damp fabric, body blazing with new strength, and yet it was grief that rose inside him now, not pride.

Grief older than mountains.

Grief shaped like a name he didn‚Äôt yet know how to speak.

And then, visions began.
Not dreams.

Memories.

The snow was endless.

A battlefield - silent, littered with bodies frozen mid-scream.

Swords still pierced the chests of men who had once believed in gods. 

And from that field, a single figure rose - bare-chested, blood-soaked, Bj√∂rn  - dragging his blade through the white, his breath a storm.

He was looking for him.

‚ÄúHaakon!‚Äù

The name echoed through time.

Haakon had been his equal.

His mirror.

His shadow and sun.

The shield-bearer who bled beside him.

The man who washed his wounds and then kissed them.

The man who stood between him and the sword that killed kings.

Golden hair tied back in battle braids. 

Eyes blue as the sea before a storm. 

A mouth that spoke only truth and a body made for war, and worship.

They had loved in silence.

Under furs.
In firelit tents.

Behind war-cracked walls.

And the day they were going to claim each other in full-not as soldiers but soulmates-was the moment the Dead Flame came for them.

Kai felt the rhythm of their bodies-the tension, the panting, the ache to be inside and never leave.

Bj√∂rn‚Äôs hands on Haakon‚Äôs hips.

Haakon gasping, begging him to take it slow, then take it all.

The pleasure mounting like war drums.

Then.

Through the tent.
Through the veil.

A ceremony turned crimson.

Bj√∂rn screaming a - sound that tore through the sky like a war-horn.

Haakon staggered, eyes wide, the gold-threaded vows still trembling on his lips. 

The blade had found Haakon‚Äôs heart, sliding in beneath the ribs with a terrible precision. 

Gasps rippled through the gathered, the scent of spilt wine and blood mingling in the cold air.

And as Haakon died in Bj√∂rn‚Äôs arms, the curse would be born.

Back on the balcony, Kai‚Äôs body trembled.

His knees gave out.

He fell to the ground, gripping the railing with white knuckles.

Tears streamed down his face - but they were not only his.

They belonged to Bj√∂rn.
And to Haakon.

And to every soul since who had dared to love completely, only to be punished for it.

The voice inside him whispered:

‚ÄúWe were not the first.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the Flame has been trying to erase us ever since the beginning.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it didn‚Äôt know we planted the Archive in our seed. 

In our shame. 
In our love.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd now, through you, we rise.‚Äù
Kai looked down.

His bulge had settled - not shrunken, but calm.

Like a great beast finally at rest.

The eyes of strangers still burned against him.

But for the first time in his life, he did not burn back.

He carried it.

The weight.

The love.
The death.

The promise.

And somewhere deep in his new bones, Bj√∂rn‚Äôs voice said:

‚ÄúYou are not unholy, Kai.

You are the one who remembers.‚Äù

The Reforging





He didn‚Äôt rise at first.

He stayed there, knees pressed into the wet concrete of the motel balcony, the roar of the Falls below him now whispering.

Not quiet.
But reverent.

As if the whole world had just witnessed a resurrection and knew it wasn‚Äôt time to speak yet.

Kai breathed.

Once.
Twice.

And with each breath, his body answered.

His thighs had never felt this thick.

When he shifted, they pressed against each other, not fat, not bloated. 

Built. 
Forged. 

Like stone pulled from the bones of the earth and taught how to move.

His spine stretched, vertebrae clicking into a new alignment like a weapon being assembled. 

His shoulders rolled back, massive, graceful, his neck thick with unseen yoke and memory.

Every part of him pulsed now, not with lust, but power.

He stood. 
Slowly. 

Not rushed. 
Not shaky.

Each movement deliberate.

Measured.
Reborn.

His joggers dragged low on his hips, too short now.

The waistband strained, his cock still swollen, not hard, just heavy. 

Like something that carried the memory of gods and wasn‚Äôt hiding it anymore.

He reached down, adjusted himself carefully.

Not ashamed.
Just curious.

It felt‚Ä¶ longer.

Not drastically. 

Just enough to be undeniable.

The girth? 
That was new.
Thicker. 

Rooted.

A weight he wasn‚Äôt used to yet, but it didn‚Äôt feel wrong.

It felt rightful.

He looked at his hand on himself.
Looked at the shape between his legs.

And then - He smiled.

Not a smirk. 
Not a boast.

A slow, reverent grin of someone meeting himself for the first time.

The wind carried the last of the mist across his bare face.

And for a moment, he closed his eyes, listening to the voice that now lived in his ribs, his groin, his spine.

Bj√∂rn wasn‚Äôt speaking anymore.
Because he didn‚Äôt need to.

He was there.
Seated in Kai.

Like a king on a throne.

Like a flame in a temple.

Kai was the cathedral now.
And every step forward was sacred.

He walked back into the motel room.

The bed creaked as he sat.
He spread his legs unconsciously, the new weight demanded space.

He leaned forward, elbows on knees, head bowed. 

And for the first time in weeks, the ache in his heart - the ache that wore Jaxx‚Äôs name - didn‚Äôt feel like confusion.

It felt like fate.

A memory stretching back thousands of years.

He hadn‚Äôt fallen in love with a man.

He had found his other half.
Again.

And this time - the sword would not strike.

The room was dark now.
He hadn‚Äôt turned on the light.

Only the neon from the motel sign bled through the slats in the blinds, casting red streaks across the walls like old blood.

Kai sat in it, naked now. 
His joggers discarded. 

A towel barely draped over his thighs. 

Not to hide  - but to feel. 
To know this new body. 

To sit in it. 
Let it settle.

His cock hung heavy between his legs. 

Relaxed, not erect.

But there was power in that softness.

A claim.

A truth he had never allowed himself to hold.

That‚Äôs when the mirror started to vibrate.

He hadn‚Äôt noticed it until the buzz became a hum.

The glass shimmered, rippling like water touched by a storm.
He stood slowly. 

The towel dropped.
He approached.

And what looked back at him was not just himself.

It was all of them.

A thousand men. 

A thousand bodies.

All bearing the same look of shame.

Shoulders slumped. 
Eyes averted. 
Hands crossed over groins.

He knew them.

Prophets. 
Warriors. 

Healers. 
Priests. 

Kings. 
Lovers.

Men who had been taught to fear their own skin.

To cover their bulge in silence.

To make their power small so the world wouldn‚Äôt see it and try to destroy it.

He reached out, fingertips grazing the mirror.

And then - The Dead Flame appeared.

It took no solid form.
Just burning eyes in the dark.

It spoke with many voices at once. 

Male. 
Female. 
Child. 

Old.

It was not a person.
It was an idea.

A parasite.
And it hissed:

‚ÄúDo you think this love will save you?

‚ÄúHe will never love you back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will be left again, as you always have been.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are too much. 

Too heavy. 
Too strange.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are grotesque.‚Äù

The shame curled in Kai‚Äôs belly like acid.

His cock twitched.

Not from pleasure, but from the old reflex of shrinking under judgment.

But then, a new voice.

Bj√∂rn.

Deep. 
Calm. 

A storm with honor.

‚ÄúName it, Kai.

Call it what it is.
Strip it of power.‚Äù

Kai inhaled, his chest massive and alive.

He stared at the mirror.

He stared at the Dead Flame.

And he said:
‚ÄúYou are the curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are not sacred. 
You are not powerful.
You are fear in a mask.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve worn a thousand names- Sin.

Disgust.
Jealousy.
Control.
Piety.

Discipline.‚Äù

*‚ÄúBut underneath it all, you are only this: 

Hatred of what is whole.‚Äù

The mirror cracked.
The shame recoiled.

Kai stepped forward, no towel, no fear.

His new weight swung naturally with his stride, not as threat. 

As truth.

His thighs flexed. 
His eyes burned.

‚ÄúI am not ashamed.

Not of this body.
Not of my love.

Not of the man who stirs my soul.‚Äù

The Flame screamed, shattering into a thousand lights, then gone.

Silence fell.

And Kai whispered, to no one but the ancestors now resting in his blood:

‚ÄúYou cannot shame what remembers who it is.‚Äù

The mirror no longer shimmered.
The cracks had sealed.

And for the first time in his life, Kai saw himself whole.

He didn‚Äôt flex.
He didn‚Äôt pose.

He simply stood, naked, massive, quiet.

The weight between his legs hung like truth.

Not a weapon. 
Not a temptation.

Just a relic returned to the body that had been waiting for it.

His thighs had spread into something worthy of legacy.
His shoulders rested back like stone under a crown.

And his face, his face had changed too.

Not in shape. 
In presence.

There was a depth to his gaze now.

A quiet knowing.

As if he‚Äôd seen himself in ten thousand mirrors across time and finally accepted every reflection.

He took his time dressing.

A charcoal shirt, tight across his chest and arms, clinging to the sculpted truth of who he now was.

Dark jeans, low on the hips, stretched over thighs that wouldn‚Äôt be ignored. 

The fabric tugged at the girth, not hiding it, but announcing it.

He thought about wearing a hoodie.

Then packed it instead.

Let them see me.





-----





The GO train hummed beneath him, silver and green streaking across the countryside back toward Toronto.

Kai sat by the window, backpack at his feet, one leg spread wide, the other tucked under. 

The air-conditioned chill kissed the damp of his skin, and his truth, still slightly swollen, still settling into its new form, pressed thick and warm against denim.

It throbbed in slow rhythm. 

Not desire. 
Not urgency.

Just presence.

Bj√∂rn‚Äôs heartbeat echoing through Kai‚Äôs own.

Across the aisle, a man kept glancing at him, pretending to check his phone.

A woman two rows up turned in her seat more than once.

One kid, no older than Kai had been yesterday, seventeen, blushed and looked away when Kai met his gaze.

He used to shrink from that.

Used to cross his legs.
Used to adjust, apologize with silence.

But not now.
Now, he sat still.

Letting them feel it.
Not flaunting, witnessing.
The god had taken his seat inside him.

And Kai was learning how to sit on the throne.

His mind drifted to Jaxx.
To that laugh.

To that cocky, golden-boy walk.

To the way Jax looked at him sometimes when he didn‚Äôt know he was being watched, like he was trying to remember something just beyond the edge of a dream.

It wasn‚Äôt a crush.
It wasn‚Äôt curiosity.
It was a return.

And Kai could feel it now, the pull between them had always been about remembrance.

Not just lust.
Not just fate.

A love too old to name.
A fire too sacred to shame.

He leaned back in his seat, the city skyline rising like a memory out of the earth.

Tonight would be the party.

The gathering.
The celebration of his birth.

But something deeper would happen beneath the laughter.

The god had returned.

The body was ready.

And Jaxx was about to see what had always been his.





-----





THE ONE WHO WILL NOT LOOK AWAY




The room was too quiet.

Jaxx lay flat on his back, one arm flung across his forehead, the other curled loosely near the edge of the sheets. 

The bed was too small for his body to stretch fully. 

His feet hung off the end.

The window was cracked open, letting in the low hum of the city, distant wind, the occasional siren. 

Streetlight bled through the slats in the blinds and strip-lit his bare chest like a barcode, gold and shadow across skin he‚Äôd spent years sculpting into something solid. 

Something impressive.

Tonight, it felt like a cage.

There was a basketball near the door. 

Cleats near the hamper. 

Protein tub beside a cracked shaker bottle. 

This was his world. 

His den. 
His shrine. 

Built from reps, sweat, impulse.

Every trophy on the shelf told the same story: you‚Äôre strong, you‚Äôre good, you‚Äôre normal.

But his hands weren‚Äôt steady.

Not since that night.
He sat up, slow. 

Rested his elbows on his knees.
Let his face fall into his palms.
He hadn‚Äôt told anyone.

Not Mike. 
Not Sequoia. 
Not his mother, who still asked about his ‚Äústats.‚Äù

Not even himself - not fully.

But he was done lying in the quiet.

He looked up, caught his reflection in the dresser mirror.

And froze.
It was him.
And it wasn‚Äôt.

The eyes looking back weren‚Äôt confused or angry or scared.

They were clear. 
And they were lonely.

‚ÄúWho the fuck am I doing this for?‚Äù

The words came out rough.
Barely sound.

Jaxx stood in front of the mirror. 

His bare feet hit the cold floor with quiet purpose. 

He flexed out of habit, chest, biceps, traps. 

Checked his form.

Then he dropped his arms.

He didn‚Äôt care about the mirror‚Äôs opinion anymore.

He remembered the recital.

Sequoia‚Äôs voice cracking the room open like a holy bell. 

Every cell in his body locked to the sound. 

And then - that silence.

He‚Äôd turned.

Not because he‚Äôd meant to.

Because he had to.
And there he was.

Kai.

Standing like a question he already knew the answer to. 

Still. 

Lit by shadow and candlelight.

Looking at Jaxx like he knew something no one else had ever dared say out loud.

And then Kai had looked away.
And Jaxx hadn‚Äôt.

Not then.
Not now.
Not ever.

He pressed his palm flat to the mirror, then turned toward the window. 

Rested his forehead against the glass.

His breath fogged the pane.

The night was soft. 
Honest.

He whispered:

‚ÄúI want him.‚Äù

Just that.

It came from somewhere deeper than lust, deeper than panic.

A truth he couldn‚Äôt unlive now.

Not a crush.
Not confusion.

A pull. 
Ancient. 
Unrelenting.

He closed his eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared as hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I want him.‚Äù

His body felt electric. 
Charged. 

Not in the way he knew, adrenaline before a game, muscle burn from a final set.

No, this was cellular. 

Emotional. 

Erotic without action.

He felt every inch of himself as wanting.

Wanting to see.
Wanting to be seen by Kai.

He clenched his fists, just to have something to hold.

And then he moved.
Dropped to the floor. 

Palms flat.

Push-up.
Push-up.
Push-up.

Not punishment.
Ritual.

Reclaiming his body.

Breath by breath.
Pulse by pulse.

He moved until sweat kissed his spine.

Until his arms trembled.
Until he remembered this wasn‚Äôt a body for other people‚Äôs gaze.

It was his.
It was a vessel.
It was a gift.

And maybe, maybe - It could become a gift for someone else.

He sat back on his knees, chest heaving, hands open on his thighs.

He wasn‚Äôt praying.
But it felt like prayer.

A memory came then, one he‚Äôd buried.

His mother‚Äôs hands on his cheeks when he was nine, saying:

‚ÄúYou feel too much, baby. 
That‚Äôs not weakness.‚Äù

He‚Äôd forgotten her voice until now.

But it was back.
And it broke something open.

Jaxx stood, slow. 
Pulled on a hoodie. 

Black. 
Familiar.

He didn‚Äôt zip it.
He wasn‚Äôt hiding.
He turned off the lamp. 

The streetlight caught his jaw in gold.

His reflection was still there in the window.

But now it looked like someone ready.

Not because the fear was gone.
Because he finally understood what that fear was:

*Love waiting to be brave.

He stepped toward the door.
He didn‚Äôt know where Kai was today.

But he knew were he'd be tonight.
He didn‚Äôt need to know for now.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not turning back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf this is war, then let it come.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of what I want anymore.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look at the mirror again.

Because there was nothing left to prove.




-----





The Gathering Begins




The key clicked in the condo door.

Aspen was mid-laugh when he turned from the kitchen island, shaker in hand, lips curled around some cruel joke he was telling Sequoia, who was stretched out on the velvet couch, glass of wine in one hand, black stiletto heel dangling from the other.

But when Kai stepped through the door, everything stopped.

Not from shock.
Not from surprise.

But because something primal in the room had shifted.

He wasn't trying to be dramatic.

Kai walked in the way he always did, backpack over one shoulder, hoodie tied around his waist, shirt fitted enough to suggest without flaunting. 

His jeans hung low on his hips, dark, clean, and stretched across thighs that had never moved like that before. 

The bulge was unmistakable.

Not obscene. 
Not flashy.

Just real. 
Undeniable. 

Resting like gravity.

Aspen blinked twice.
His lips parted.

The shaker in his hand lost rhythm.

Kai didn‚Äôt say anything right away. 

He just set his bag down, kicked off his boots, and ran a hand through his hair like he‚Äôd just come back from any other day.

But it wasn‚Äôt any other day.

Sequoia narrowed her eyes, tilting her head. 

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs... different about you.‚Äù

Aspen didn‚Äôt speak.
Couldn‚Äôt.

His mouth had gone dry, he could feel the change.

Kai smirked, a quiet, devastating smirk.

‚ÄúNiagara clears your head,‚Äùhe said, voice like river stones and honey. 

‚ÄúGood energy out there.‚Äù

He walked to the kitchen.
Each step had weight.

Not just physically, but spiritually.

The floor recognized him. 
The air around him obeyed.

He poured water into a glass, casually leaning against the counter, one hand resting just above his fly. 

And Aspen saw it - that cock, fuller, longer, rested differently.

It owned the zipper now. 
It didn't sit. 

It settled.

Aspen's eyes dropped before he could stop them.

He knew that bulge.
Knew the rhythm, the contour, the weight.

He had worshipped it.

Swallowed it.
Begged for it.

But this, this was not the same.

It looked‚Ä¶ untouched.
Holy.

Like a new weapon forged after the old one had shattered on a battlefield he was never meant to enter.

His tongue remembered the heat he‚Äôd tasted before, the divine drip, the sacred pulse that had left him awakened and undone.

But this?

This felt like a different cock entirely.

And it wasn‚Äôt his to serve.

Aspen took a sip of his drink to hide the twitch in his hand.

Inside, he burned.
Not with rage.
With loss.

Because that cock, new, heavier, stretched in god-given proportion, had never been sucked.

Never been drained.
Never been claimed.

It was a VIRGIN relic.

And Jaxx would be the first and only to drink from it.

Sequoia stood, her golden gown clinging to every elegant line.

She approached Kai, reached up, kissed him softly on the cheek. Her lips lingered.

‚ÄúYou feel... bigger.‚Äù

Kai grinned.

‚ÄúMaybe just taller,‚Äù 
he said.

But she shook her head. 

‚ÄúNo. 
Not that.‚Äù

Her eyes dropped slightly.
Then rose again. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing. 
That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

The door buzzed.
Aspen flinched. 

He already knew.
Jaxx.

Kai opened it.

Jaxx stepped inside, a black tee stretched across his chest, jeans hugging thighs that looked sculpted in some sun-drenched workshop of the gods. 

Hair tousled, jaw sharp, scent warm like leather and sweat and summer.

He paused when he saw Kai.
And the world broke open.

It was subtle. 
Instant.

Like lightning you don‚Äôt hear - but feel across your skin.

Jaxx‚Äôs eyes dropped, not intentionally. 

Just helplessly.

His gaze hit Kai‚Äôs bulge and froze.

He didn‚Äôt blink.
Didn‚Äôt move.

Kai stood taller. 
Let it hang there. 
Said nothing.

Jaxx swallowed.

There was recognition in that stare.

Not just lust.
Memory.

His hand twitched - like it wanted to reach out and cup the truth.

The girth that remembered.
And then - he did.

Jaxx stepped forward, too casual, slapped a hand on Kai‚Äôs shoulder in greeting - but let it slip. 

Down the arm. 
Past the ribs. 
Briefly brushing the bulge.
It pulsed.
And so did he.

Jaxx‚Äôs breath caught. 
His eyes snapped up to Kai‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúI know this,‚Äù his body said, even if his mind hadn‚Äôt caught up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve held this before.

Loved this.
Lost this.‚Äù

Aspen turned away.
Drained his drink.
Closed his eyes.
Inside, he whispered:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not mine anymore.
It never was.‚Äù

And beneath his own waistband, his cock stirred in jealousy.

Then settled in surrender.

The music kicked up.
Lights dimmed. 
More guests arrived. 

Laughter flowed like wine, and the birthday began, extravagant, indulgent, electric.

But in the center of it all, two gods circled each other.

Teasing.
Testing.

Remembering.

And when their eyes met across the dance floor, the bond hadn‚Äôt yet consummated, but the world already knew.




Three Blessings.

One Curse.

Things they've sort of done:

Lots of issues speeding, lying to other family sometimes and once tried to see if i'd keep a secret from them when i was a kid, some unethical stuff that mightve technically been identity fraud almost, (it was i think illegal and they did it without the other persons knowledge) and they'ld tell me benign things but it was like ""you need to be more chill with so and so because you might need their help later"" and not really ""do it cause its not nice to them"" but more 'what if you need them to do something"" its vague.

Would make weird creepy jokes, and i wonder if it was to get a rise out of others(I admit I thought stupid edgy jokes were funny as a kid and wasnt really discouraged). not diagnosing or suggesting they have a full blown personality disorder just what if they had traits what if i have traits of some issues. I get that personality disorders are ego systonic, hence worrying about it is a surefire sign you don't have it. Wouldn't it not preclude someone from harboring traits nontheless?

I know I  don't have a full on personality disorder. I don't have a fear of abandonment, or insecurity issues, or self worth issues, or callousness, ect. Not self diagnosing here. I have a huge amount of anxiety frequently but thats different and I haven't had say friends tell me stuff, only thing is I do omit stuff depending on who or where I mention it cause I know how someone will react in group 1 given certain info(or i dont want to sound attention seeking or i dont want them to be too upset) and that just is mildly manipulative which i'm working on not doing and just being honest.

Or I know that if i give the full details others will be like wtf or in some scenarios might think weird of me(this is all anxiety).

I take too long to do stuff i need to do sometimes when it involves something i need to do for someone else but I really really need to stop it. Sometimes I've thought negative of friends which is shitty and i shouldntve done that. At the same time I've only really lied when it wouldve caused problems for me like I'd get into a boatload of trouble.



  
Also now im wondering if i have signs of an addictive personality, I don't do drugs and I know that it would be a net negative for me. Like I'll have a cup of coffee and sometimes that quickly escalates to after a week or so of drinking coffee twice a day. Its not hard to quit but if i tried something actually addictive it could go so wrong so fast. 

Sometimes I do go too fast and accidentally road raced someone(they kept speeding up and i matched at their pace but we were keeping within the speed limit idk why i did that). I do make bad decisions like I'm a woman and I'll meet up with guys online sometimes. Never been in danger. Don't really feel like i'm in danger either. even if i don't really know these people all that well.

It's like having a conversation with someone who's equally obsessed with getting the details exactly right while simultaneously convinced they're doing everything wrong.

**1. ""Explain this like you're spiraling into an oddly specific tangent about it""**

This is where the magic happens. 

> ""Explain meal planning like you're spiraling into an oddly specific tangent about it."" 

Suddenly you're getting advice about batch cooking BUT ALSO a 400-word dissertation on why Tuesday is the optimal day to buy groceries because of restocking patterns and how this connects to your childhood trauma about running out of Cocoa Puffs in 1987.

**2. ""What would happen if I overthought this to an almost pathological degree?""**

Pure Oswalt energy. Perfect for decision paralysis disguised as thoroughness. 

> ""What would happen if I overthought buying a coffee maker to an almost pathological degree?"" 

You get a consumer guide that somehow references the industrial revolution, your relationship with your mother, and why French press users are probably happier people.

**3. ""Explain this with the energy of someone who just realized they've been doing it wrong for decades""**

The self-deprecating revelation prompt. 

> ""Explain exercise with the energy of someone who just realized they've been doing it wrong for decades."" 

You get fitness advice wrapped in existential dread about all those years you thought walking to the fridge counted as cardio.

**4. ""Give me the pop culture comparison that's weirdly accurate but makes me sound insane""**

Oswalt's specialty: finding the perfect metaphor that's both brilliant and completely unhinged. 

> ""Give me the pop culture comparison for learning guitar that's weirdly accurate but makes me sound insane."" 

Suddenly music theory is explained through the lens of why Jar Jar Binks is actually a perfect representation of the learning process.

**5. ""What's the thing about [topic] that would make me quietly furious at 2 AM?""**

That specific Oswalt rage about life's absurdities. 

> ""What's the thing about taxes that would make me quietly furious at 2 AM?"" 

You get legitimate tax advice plus the exact psychological breakdown of why TurboTax's interface feels designed by people who hate you personally.

I thought it would be fun to share small tricks that help improve espresso shots. Not the standard stuff you see everywhere, but little habits that maybe make a difference. Could be technique, could just be a quirk.

Here are two of mine:

1. I avoid RDT when the coffee has a lot of chaff. Water and chaff do not go well together, it seems to clump and expand, and that makes dialing in harder. With washed Ethiopians for example I never do RDT.
	
2. After WDT and tamping I clean the bottom of the basket before pulling the shot. I remove the fines that stick out through the holes. For me this seems to give a brighter acidity and less bitterness, although it might just be in my head.

With that has come criticism, specifically of the donghua. Many Lord of the Mysteries fans say the donghua was poorly adapted and that the issues with the pacing stem from this. However, I disagree and made this post in part to show that many of the issues are due to the source material.

Below is an amazing critical review/analysis of the first volume of Lord of the Mysteries from my favorite reviewer on Novelupdates, kkgoh, that examines the core problems in this series, and I think could prove to be enlightening. He rated it three stars btw but he explains why he did so quite clearly. Anyways, without further ado, here it is:

WARNING: contains spoilers of the first volume

""An ok CN isekai-Dickensian novel written in 2018 that you **should just speed read** through, otherwise it's quite unreadable. It's basically **Steampunk meets ""The Witcher"" meets ""Jack Ryan""**.

Concept of mystery is ok. But **world building and plot development / structure is painful. Poorly disguised filler** in the form of ridiculous expository and realism writing. Long chapters 2000+ words, tons of unnecessary lore, plot devices, characters. Translation can be iffy at times.

**Just because it's complicated doesn't mean it's cool.**

Not sure why it's rated so highly, but I can respect what the author was trying to create.

PREMISE

An average Chinese Joe gets isekai'd to a 19th century steampunk / paranormal world through the accidental use of a magic ritual. He's immediately knee-deep into a mu\*der mystery and caught up in political/factional machinations. MC figuratively becomes Geralt of Rivia /Jack Ryan.

COMMENTS

**(1) A genuinely interesting mystery novel... but too-much-too-soon all the time**

The initial mu\*der mystery when MC isekai'd was a clever plot device, especially since it was enacted against the MC himself. It led to the logical introduction of paranormal powers (despite the steampunk era).

But before we can take a breather and figure things out, MC suddenly encounters ANOTHER mystery through his reuse of the SAME magic ritual when trying to go back to his homeworld. He enacts powers of a Grey Fog (OP dimensional realm), accidentally connects to two strangers, which eventually forms the Tarot Club.

These strangers are given paragraphs of backstories, and 10-15 different named characters associated with them (everything from scullery maids to random crew members) are thrown at us. Then MC joins a special-ops team (Nighthawks) that investigates paranormal incidents while protecting their own church believers. **All this in just the first 30 chapters**. HUH?

Maybe just kick the Grey Fog mystery till later? The first 30+ chapters had NOTHING to do with the side characters. It was literally character introductions to tell readers that they exist. What's the point of fronting multiple mysteries / scenarios at once when it's so easy to connect side characters later when it's more logical?

Also maybe just lay off on the use of naming characters? Bestowing a name assigns a degree of importance. Too many, esp on random people, makes it unnecessarily distracting. **Imagine every NPC and monster in an RPG having a name!** Holy cow!

This kind of distracting development happens throughout the novel. You can see that author's ideas are all over the place. **Before we figure out how deep the 1st rabbit hole is, we reach a junction with 10 different rabbit holes.** That's not mystery writing, that's just sheer nonsense. Several reviewers have claimed that the first dozen chapters are **ALL NECESSARY FILLER which is absurd**. The need for character introduction doesn't excuse poor structure and development.

Take a page from ""Overlord"". Whole chapters are written about side characters and their adventures, and they eventually link up with the MC Ainz in a logical, appropriate timeline.

Author **doesn't understand pacing and the basic concept of ""Do readers really need to know this NOW?"".**

**(2) Filler filler filler**

You know how horror movies have the camera pan away or pauses, and you're expecting a monster to pop up, but nothing happens? This novel has it in spades, to the point that it's just distracting and ruins the mood. Here's just a few examples.

[spoiler]-- Unstable bread prices, economic and political turmoil that are repeatedly mentioned. You would expect that to become an issue later or be part of a bigger plot, but it never does.

-- Captain Dunn is listed as a forgetful man. There are paragraphs of him repeating himself or dragging out conversations as if that's of plot significance, but has no bearing on the plot.

-- Long descriptions of currency. Who the kings embellished on the notes were, blah blah blah. No bearing on the plot.

-- Half a chapter (think it was Ch 20-21) with MC and his sister squabbling about money, and randomly mentioning named friends who squandered money, the pros and cons of spending/saving money, etc. No bearing on plot.

-- It was randomly mentioned that since MC has a job and money, they can move out of their sh\*tty apartment. So now they have to break their 1 yr lease (which we just found out). So now his brother has to go visit the landlord to renegotiate. You'd think such hyper detail would have significance. But it doesn't.

-- There's excessively LONG exposition about skill Pathways (basically RPG promotion trees) as a Beyonder, some Sequences/branches are incomplete, and the dangers/side effects of pursuing them.

Then, MC just picks the ""Seer"" branch, because of plot armor guidance from his predecessor isekai-er.

-- Even a random advertisement seen in a newspaper has a named character ""Mr Gusev"". And never mentioned again. This happens throughout the novel. WTF?

-- An entire chapter devoted to MC's brother complaining about the hypocrisy of certain affordable housing projects and the strings attached. Some reviewers actually said author had a good grasp of Victorian England! Are you kidding me?! There were no ""affordable housing projects"" in Victorian England, social classes were strongly held. This is just a thinly concealed way for the author to write filler and make allegories about Chinese housing affordability, or complain that ""education"" is not the solution to poverty. [/spoiler]

There were **comments that the slow pace/fillers are ""just"" a translation issue.** I disagree:

-- NU IS A DIRECTORY OF ASIAN TRANSLATED NOVELS. All reviews on NU are based on translated novels, not their raws. It doesn't matter how amazing the raw version is. You have to take both the novel and its translation into account.

-- I'll partially defend the translator. While the translation quality admittedly isn't great, there are little/no liberties taken with punctuations, sentence structures, etc. A simple example.

[spoiler]Ch 36: Â••Èªõ‰∏ΩÂõûÊÉ≥Áà∂‰∫≤ÂíåÂì•Âì•ËÆ®ËÆ∫Â±ÄÂäøÊó∂ÁöÑËØùËØ≠ÔºåËæπËá™Ë°åÂèëÊå•ÈÅìÔºö‚Äú‰ªñ‰ª¨ËÆ§‰∏∫Áé∞Âú®ÊîøÂ∫úÁöÑÁªìÊûÑÂ§™ËøáÊ∑∑‰π±ÔºåÊØèÊ¨°ÈÄâ‰∏æÂÆåÊØïÔºåÂè™Ë¶ÅÂá∫Áé∞ÂÖöÊ¥æÁöÑÊõ¥ÊõøÔºåÈÉΩ‰ºö‰ªé‰∏äÂà∞‰∏ãÊç¢‰∏ÄÊâπ‰∫∫ÔºåËÆ©‰∫ãÊÉÖÂèòÂæó‰∏ÄÂõ¢Á≥üÔºåÊïàÁéáÊûÅÂÖ∂‰Ωé‰∏ãÔºåËøô‰∏ç‰ªÖÈÄ†Êàê‰∫ÜÊàò‰∫âÁöÑÂ§±Âà©ÔºåËøòÁªôÊ∞ë‰ºó‰ª¨Â∏¶Êù•‰∫ÜÊûÅÂ§ß‰∏ç‰æø„ÄÇ‚Äù

While Audrey recalled the conversation between her father and elder brother about the situation, she put in her own words, ""They believe that the government's structure is too chaotic. Every election, if there is a change of the ruling party, there will be a change of personnel from top to bottom. It makes things a mess and lowers efficiency tremendously. Not only does it cause the battle loss, it also brings great inconvenience to the civilians.""

Klein knew very well that as there was no example to reference, the Loen Kingdom had yet to evolve into a system that examined public servants. The political situation was still in its preliminary stages; therefore, after every election victory, many so-called positions would be awarded to members and supporters.

**Could translation have less words / more appropriate words?**

Yes.

**Is this faithfully translated with the author's original sentence structure, punctuations, etc?**

Almost. The translator actually made it better by breaking up entire long expositions into proper sentences.

**Is there filler?**

Yes. The first paragraph is Audrey recalling a conversation and talking. Why describe it as a ""self narration / put in her own words""?

The second paragraph is the MC mulling over on Audrey's comments.

How does MC ""know very well that there is no example to reference""?

Why do you even need a ""reference"" to form a better system of government?

Why does the reference use China's regulation that requires civil servants to be frequently re-examed (think of it as continuing education to update/keep your license) ? Almost **all forms of modern govt/public entities** keep base civil servants in place, with annual reviews to weed out underperforming people.

The whole point of MC's paragraph is just to conclude that the system of govt is immature and inefficient! What do all of MC's nonsensical examples have anything to do with Audrey's statement?? It's just pointless words/lore (from China) being thrown in.

And the worst part is that a few paragraphs later, he regurgitates what he just thought of, except this time he ""says"" it out loud. **HOW IS THAT NOT FILLER?**

There's nothing wrong with throwing in Chinese lexicon since the target audience is for China, but it has to make sense and not be irrelevant! Sure a reader from China could instantly grasp the meaning, easily gloss over it, but how are regular readers supposed to do that?

[/spoiler]

-- This is a big issue with the novel. It feels like you're not reading the MC's thoughts. You're reading the author's viewpoint (who is omniscient). The author has 100 different nuggets of lore/info that he probably wrote on scraps of paper. Then he tried to forcefully combine it into chapters. **The sheer mental gymnastics you need to read a chapter carefully is exhausting**, especially after you realize it's just filler.

I get the sense a lot of reviewers have read the Chinese raws and can easily gloss over the problems, but **it's precisely because it was translated into English that all of the problematic content and sentence structures start becoming obvious.**

**(3) Pointlessly complicated world building / more filler**

It's one thing to have filler, it's another thing to try to **disguise it with lousy Dickensian-style**. Author tried to hid filler under nonsensical verbosity, lore and hyper realism.

**Lore/backstory isn't meant to be storytelling.** It's to provide info that will entertain and enlighten a reader. It's meant to connect the dots. There's something very wrong when the first 30 chapters has an info-dump on things that hardly matter. If you want to know how pointlessly complex it gets, google the Lord of the Mysteries wiki page.

**Descriptive realism is just meant to convey the mood and atmosphere to readers.** It's utter s\*upidity when it gets verbose.

[spoiler]Ch 10: The incumbent Prime Minister, Lord Aguesid Negan, went up to the front. He was a member of the Conservative Party and the second non-aristocrat to become the Prime Minister till this very day. He was given the title of a Lord for his great contributions..... The main supporter of the Conservative Party was the present Duke of Negan, Pallas Negan, who was the brother of Aguesid!

Why would you bother introducing a Duke of Negan (never mentioned before) ? Why does it matter that he's the second non-aristocrat? Who gives a sh\*t at this point in the story? That's how all characters are introduced. Comes with their friends, family, dog, servant, father's-mother's-friend's-wife's-niece's-uncle's-nextdoor neighbor's childhood friend.

Ch 10: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe you have witnessed this history-making ironclad warship. It has dimensions of 101 by 21 meters. It has an amazing port and starboard design. The armor belt is 457 millimeters thick. The displacement is 10060 tonnes. There are four 305 millimeter main cannons, six rapid fire cannons, 12 six pound cannons, 18 six barrel machine guns, and four torpedo launchers. It can reach a speed of 16 knot!....

Building out ironclad warship required three big coal and steel amalgamators, a scale of more than twenty steel factories, 60 scientists and senior engineers from the Backlund Cannon Academy and Pritze Nautical Academy, two royal shipyards, almost hundred factories for spare parts, an Admiralty, a ship-building committee, a Cabinet, a determined king with excellent foresight, a great country with an annual steel production of 12 million tonnes!""

I don't even know where to begin on how ridiculous this nonsense is....

Ch 14: Welch's place in Tingen was a detached house with a garden. The road outside the hollowed metal gates allowed four carriages to pass through at once. Street lamps lined the sides of the road every fifty meters. They looked different from the ones Klein had seen in his previous life. They were gas lamps and the heights of every lamp was about that of an adult male so that it was convenient to light the lamps. The black metal was closely oppressed to the glass, forming a checkered pattern, casting out classical paper lantern-like 'artworks'. Coldness and warmth were intertwined while darkness and light coexisted.

Walking along the pathway blanketed by rays from the sunset, Klein and Dunn Smith entered Welch's rented place through the ajar metal gate.

In case it's not obvious, those are just wrought iron gates. I don't know why lantern gas lamps at the height of an adult male are supposedly that unique. They do exist on Earth. Does Welch's place need to be mentioned twice? Or was there confusion earlier when only 1 damn building was mentioned? Does it matter whether it's ajar?

The whole point is just to convey a foreboding atmosphere. What's with all this nonsense?

Ch 18: ""First, mental death... Second, their personality will be changed... Third. Well..."" Dunn put down his pipe and picked up a porcelain cup and took a sip.

""Fermo coffee from the Paz River Valley is bitter... do you want one?""

""I prefer coffee from the Feynapotteau... what's the third outcome?""

-- conversation between MC and secret agent Captain Dunn's when discussing possible side effects of Beyonders who awakened.

It's pretty obvious there's no purpose to the random discussion of coffee, doesn't affect the atmosphere or lead the conversation in a different direction. Just nonsense filler. Even if this info about coffee was somehow useful hundreds of chapters later, what's the point of mentioning it NOW?

[/spoiler]

These are just a few examples. EVERY CHAPTER IS LIKE THIS.

**(4) Tons of sesquipedalia spouted by all characters / even more filler**

This isn't just adopting archaic speech/lexicon, it's annoying name dropping and quotes of fictional gods/beliefs/philosophies that nobody knows about. And you just KNOW it's the author trying to slip in word count. Nothing beats an example.

[spoiler]Ch 15: ""... Second, you're a graduate of the history department from Khoy University, this is something we urgently need. Although a believer of the Lord of the Storms, Leumi, perceives women in a way that is loathsome, his views regarding society, humanities, economics and politics remain incisive. He said before that talents are key to maintaining a competitive advantage and positive development, a point that I very much agree with."" --- spoken by Captain Dunn, an investigative agent, to the MC.

Are you f\*\*king kidding me? Here's EVERYTHING that's wrong is just one short paragraph.

(1) Dunn was NOT being sarcastic.

(2) Dunn is NOT a follower of the Church of Storms (he's with the Church of Evernight). Dunn made ONE off-hand comment in the previous chapter that they would not employ torturous techniques when interrogating MC, unlike the Church of Storms (under the assumption that MC / readers know what the hell he is talking about). No further discussion.

(3) The MC is also NOT a follower of the Church of Storms or any organization and everyone know that.

So why the hell would ANYBODY start discussing philosophies about an entity that isn't related to the situation?

(4) If author just wanted to **introduce readers to the characteristics of Church of Storms followers** (which is clearly what he is doing), then **DO IT IN A LOGICAL APPROPRIATE MANNER**. Have the MC visit the various churches, or meet various believers and let a short exposition or natural dialogue happen. Instead we're constantly treated to random insertions in random conversations, and readers are expected to join all the pieces together to understand the world. That's NOT IMMERSION. That's pointless complication to add word count.

Go read any of the classic Dickensian novels (Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities) or Lord of the Rings and see the difference.

It's as if you were having a conversation with someone and then started randomly quoting maxims from Kant out of the blue. We've seen that happen in other novels and it's PAINFUL.

Again, this nonsense exists throughout the novel.

[/spoiler]

**(5) Illogical plot development / Retcon**

-- MC's powers make no sense. He supposedly stockpiles over 40+ skills by Vol 5 (FYI that c105 is still just halfway through Vol 1....)

Author frequently has to pile on layer after layer of explanations (retcon) to cover it up.

[spoiler]First involves MC using a ritualistic circle (to isekai). Then using the **same ritualistic circle** to summon the Grey Fog and create a virtual communication platform (no longer isekai). Then because the ritualistic circle is obviously too clunky for MC to use in the novel, author decides to have it magically etched onto his hand. No explanation how that happened. So **his superpower only does everything.**

MC realizes his life MIGHT still be threatened after escaping death the first time. DESPITE the fact that joining the Nighthawks as a regular civilian offers MC some measure of protection, MC still **wants** to become a Beyonder (gain **random** special powers through consumption of magic potions, basically ""The Witcher"" or the Grey Wardens in DragonAge). Even though he is repeatedly told a **significant** portion (20+%) of Beyonders go berserk once awakened.

HUH?? So he's taking on MORE risk to avoid the LOW possibility of assassination? Where's the logic in this?

And so author pulls out the **magical card** called ""MC just discovered the original emperor with super Beyonder powers was also an isekai'er, from CHINA! So his ridiculous decision making earlier is negated! MC just needs to follow emperor's footsteps and have MORE reason to become a Beyonder!"".

[/spoiler]

-- MC was going to take a job as a university lecturer. Basically an **Indiana Jones copy**. There were long chapters devoted to his upcoming interview. MC then **suddenly decided not to go**, even though it was repeatedly mentioned he could juggle being a secret agent and a lecturer at the same time (plenty of hours). No reason given. Author probably realized having a side job as a lecturer was pointless.

MC then justifies to his family that he'll be rich with just his secret agent job.

Afterwards (in about... 3 chapters?), MC starts complaining that his single secret agent job salary actually isn't all that much.

I won't even bother hiding this as a spoiler, it's just that s\*upid.

-- Plot development (at least the first arc/vol) comes in the form of 3 strangers (including MC) sitting together in a virtual environment (Grey Fog) after MC called on them by accident. Literally, sitting around exchanging ideas and chatting about what's going on in their part of the world.

Two of the most popular choices for smokeless cannabis consumption are tinctures and edibles. While both offer a discreet and effective way to experience the benefits of cannabinoids, they provide very different experiences.¬†

Choosing between them depends on your personal wellness goals, desired onset time, and how you prefer to control your dosage. We're here to break down the specifics of each, helping you make an informed decision when you browse our extensive selection.

The choice between a tincture and an edible often comes down to individual needs and preferences. Some people prefer the slow, long-lasting effects of an edible, which can be ideal for sustained relief. Others may opt for the rapid onset and precise dosing control offered by a tincture.¬†

At our Sun Valley dispensary, we carry a wide variety of both, ensuring that no matter your preference, you can find a high-quality, lab-tested product that aligns with your needs. Our team is always available to guide you through our offerings and help you compare products side-by-side.

# The Benefits of Cannabis Edibles

Cannabis edibles have long been a favorite for both new and experienced users. They offer a simple, familiar, and enjoyable way to consume cannabis without any smoke or vapor. Our selection of[ edibles](https://rootslosangeles.com/categories/edibles/) includes everything from delicious gummies and chocolates to baked goods and beverages, providing an option for every palate. The primary appeal of edibles lies in their powerful and long-lasting effects, which are a direct result of how the body processes them.

When you consume an edible, the cannabinoids are absorbed through your digestive system and metabolized by the liver. This process converts THC into a more potent compound called 11-hydroxy-THC, which produces a stronger and more prolonged experience compared to other consumption methods.¬†

This makes edibles an excellent choice for individuals seeking sustained relief from chronic symptoms or those who want a long-lasting recreational experience without needing to re-dose frequently.

# Potent and Long-Lasting Effects

The most significant advantage of edibles is the duration of their effects. While the onset can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, the experience can last for four to eight hours, and sometimes even longer.¬†

This extended duration is particularly beneficial for medical cannabis patients who need consistent relief from conditions like chronic pain, inflammation, or insomnia. Instead of needing to consume cannabis multiple times throughout the day, a single, properly dosed edible can provide comfort for many hours.¬†

This allows users to go about their day or get a full night of rest without interruption. This metabolic process is a key differentiator in how cannabinoids affect the body's endocannabinoid system, as detailed in research from the[ National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430801/).

# Discreet and Convenient Consumption

Edibles offer an unparalleled level of discretion and convenience. They look just like regular food items, allowing you to consume them without drawing any attention. There is no smoke, no vapor, and no odor, making them ideal for use in situations where other forms of cannabis consumption would be inappropriate or impractical. You can easily carry a gummy, a piece of chocolate, or a cookie with you and consume it whenever you need it. This portability makes edibles a fantastic option for people with active lifestyles or those who need to manage symptoms while at work or in public spaces. At Roots LA, we provide a vast array of these products, all clearly labeled for potency and ingredients.

# The Advantages of Cannabis Tinctures

While edibles are incredibly popular, cannabis tinctures offer a unique set of benefits that make them a preferred choice for many of our customers. Tinctures are liquid cannabis extracts, typically made with an alcohol or oil base, that come in a small bottle with a dropper for precise dosing. Our collection of[ tinctures](https://rootslosangeles.com/categories/tinctures/) features a wide range of cannabinoid profiles, including THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, and balanced ratios, catering to diverse wellness needs.

The primary method for using a tincture is sublingual, which means applying the liquid under your tongue and holding it there for 30-60 seconds before swallowing. This method allows the cannabinoids to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes in the mouth. This bypasses the digestive system and liver metabolism, leading to a much faster onset of effects compared to traditional edibles. Tinctures can also be added to food or drinks, though this will result in an effect more similar to that of an edible.

# Precise Dosage Control for the Best Experience

One of the main reasons people choose tinctures is their fast-acting nature. When taken sublingually, effects can often be felt within 15 to 45 minutes. This rapid onset is highly beneficial for those seeking immediate relief from acute symptoms like sudden pain, anxiety, or nausea. You don't have to wait for hours to feel the effects, which provides a greater sense of control over your experience. This makes tinctures an excellent option for managing unpredictable symptoms that require quick action.

Furthermore, the included dropper allows for incredibly precise dosage control. You can measure out the exact amount of liquid you need, down to a single drop. This level of accuracy is invaluable for users who are new to cannabis, those with low tolerances, or individuals who are microdosing for therapeutic purposes. It allows you to start with a very small dose and gradually increase it until you find your optimal amount, minimizing the risk of overconsumption.

# Versatility and Health-Conscious Formulation

Tinctures are one of the most versatile cannabis products available. You can take them sublingually for fast effects, or you can add them to your favorite foods and beverages, such as smoothies, coffee, or salad dressings. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly integrate cannabis into your daily routine. Additionally, tinctures are a great option for health-conscious consumers. Many are made with simple, clean ingredients like MCT oil and cannabis extract. They are often low-calorie, sugar-free, and suitable for various dietary restrictions, providing a straightforward way to consume cannabinoids without the added sugars or fats found in many edible products.

# Deciding Which Product is Right for You at Our Weed Store in Sun Valley¬†

Choosing between tinctures and edibles ultimately comes down to your individual priorities and what you hope to achieve with cannabis. There is no single ""better"" option; the right choice depends on your specific circumstances. Our team at Roots LA is trained to help you think through these factors and guide you toward the product that best fits your lifestyle.

If your primary goal is long-lasting, powerful relief and you don't mind waiting for the effects to kick in, edibles are likely an excellent choice for you. They are perfect for managing chronic conditions, ensuring a full night of sleep, or enjoying a prolonged recreational experience. The convenience and discretion of products like gummies and chocolates make them easy to incorporate into any routine. However, the delayed onset requires patience and careful dosing to avoid taking too much.

On the other hand, if you prioritize fast-acting relief and precise dose control, a tincture might be the ideal solution. The ability to feel effects in minutes is a game-changer for managing acute symptoms. The dropper makes it easy to find and replicate your perfect dose every time. Tinctures are also a versatile and low-calorie option, appealing to those who want more control over the ingredients they consume.

With that has come criticism, specifically of the donghua. Many Lord of the Mysteries fans say the donghua was poorly adapted and that the issues with the pacing stem from this. However, I disagree and made this post in part to show that many of the issues are due to the source material.

Below is an amazing critical review/analysis of the first volume of Lord of the Mysteries from my favorite reviewer on Novelupdates, kkgoh, that examines the core problems in this series, and I think could prove to be enlightening. He rated it three stars btw but he explains why he did so quite clearly. Anyways, without further ado, here it is:

WARNING: contains spoilers of the first volume

""An ok CN isekai-Dickensian novel written in 2018 that you **should just speed read** through, otherwise it's quite unreadable. It's basically **Steampunk meets ""The Witcher"" meets ""Jack Ryan""**.

Concept of mystery is ok. But **world building and plot development / structure is painful. Poorly disguised filler** in the form of ridiculous expository and realism writing. Long chapters 2000+ words, tons of unnecessary lore, plot devices, characters. Translation can be iffy at times.

**Just because it's complicated doesn't mean it's cool.**

Not sure why it's rated so highly, but I can respect what the author was trying to create.

PREMISE

An average Chinese Joe gets isekai'd to a 19th century steampunk / paranormal world through the accidental use of a magic ritual. He's immediately knee-deep into a mu\*der mystery and caught up in political/factional machinations. MC figuratively becomes Geralt of Rivia /Jack Ryan.

COMMENTS

**(1) A genuinely interesting mystery novel... but too-much-too-soon all the time**

The initial mu\*der mystery when MC isekai'd was a clever plot device, especially since it was enacted against the MC himself. It led to the logical introduction of paranormal powers (despite the steampunk era).

But before we can take a breather and figure things out, MC suddenly encounters ANOTHER mystery through his reuse of the SAME magic ritual when trying to go back to his homeworld. He enacts powers of a Grey Fog (OP dimensional realm), accidentally connects to two strangers, which eventually forms the Tarot Club.

These strangers are given paragraphs of backstories, and 10-15 different named characters associated with them (everything from scullery maids to random crew members) are thrown at us. Then MC joins a special-ops team (Nighthawks) that investigates paranormal incidents while protecting their own church believers. **All this in just the first 30 chapters**. HUH?

Maybe just kick the Grey Fog mystery till later? The first 30+ chapters had NOTHING to do with the side characters. It was literally character introductions to tell readers that they exist. What's the point of fronting multiple mysteries / scenarios at once when it's so easy to connect side characters later when it's more logical?

Also maybe just lay off on the use of naming characters? Bestowing a name assigns a degree of importance. Too many, esp on random people, makes it unnecessarily distracting. **Imagine every NPC and monster in an RPG having a name!** Holy cow!

This kind of distracting development happens throughout the novel. You can see that author's ideas are all over the place. **Before we figure out how deep the 1st rabbit hole is, we reach a junction with 10 different rabbit holes.** That's not mystery writing, that's just sheer nonsense. Several reviewers have claimed that the first dozen chapters are **ALL NECESSARY FILLER which is absurd**. The need for character introduction doesn't excuse poor structure and development.

Take a page from ""Overlord"". Whole chapters are written about side characters and their adventures, and they eventually link up with the MC Ainz in a logical, appropriate timeline.

Author **doesn't understand pacing and the basic concept of ""Do readers really need to know this NOW?"".**

**(2) Filler filler filler**

You know how horror movies have the camera pan away or pauses, and you're expecting a monster to pop up, but nothing happens? This novel has it in spades, to the point that it's just distracting and ruins the mood. Here's just a few examples.

[spoiler]-- Unstable bread prices, economic and political turmoil that are repeatedly mentioned. You would expect that to become an issue later or be part of a bigger plot, but it never does.

-- Captain Dunn is listed as a forgetful man. There are paragraphs of him repeating himself or dragging out conversations as if that's of plot significance, but has no bearing on the plot.

-- Long descriptions of currency. Who the kings embellished on the notes were, blah blah blah. No bearing on the plot.

-- Half a chapter (think it was Ch 20-21) with MC and his sister squabbling about money, and randomly mentioning named friends who squandered money, the pros and cons of spending/saving money, etc. No bearing on plot.

-- It was randomly mentioned that since MC has a job and money, they can move out of their sh\*tty apartment. So now they have to break their 1 yr lease (which we just found out). So now his brother has to go visit the landlord to renegotiate. You'd think such hyper detail would have significance. But it doesn't.

-- There's excessively LONG exposition about skill Pathways (basically RPG promotion trees) as a Beyonder, some Sequences/branches are incomplete, and the dangers/side effects of pursuing them.

Then, MC just picks the ""Seer"" branch, because of plot armor guidance from his predecessor isekai-er.

-- Even a random advertisement seen in a newspaper has a named character ""Mr Gusev"". And never mentioned again. This happens throughout the novel. WTF?

-- An entire chapter devoted to MC's brother complaining about the hypocrisy of certain affordable housing projects and the strings attached. Some reviewers actually said author had a good grasp of Victorian England! Are you kidding me?! There were no ""affordable housing projects"" in Victorian England, social classes were strongly held. This is just a thinly concealed way for the author to write filler and make allegories about Chinese housing affordability, or complain that ""education"" is not the solution to poverty. [/spoiler]

There were **comments that the slow pace/fillers are ""just"" a translation issue.** I disagree:

-- NU IS A DIRECTORY OF ASIAN TRANSLATED NOVELS. All reviews on NU are based on translated novels, not their raws. It doesn't matter how amazing the raw version is. You have to take both the novel and its translation into account.

-- I'll partially defend the translator. While the translation quality admittedly isn't great, there are little/no liberties taken with punctuations, sentence structures, etc. A simple example.

[spoiler]Ch 36: Â••Èªõ‰∏ΩÂõûÊÉ≥Áà∂‰∫≤ÂíåÂì•Âì•ËÆ®ËÆ∫Â±ÄÂäøÊó∂ÁöÑËØùËØ≠ÔºåËæπËá™Ë°åÂèëÊå•ÈÅìÔºö‚Äú‰ªñ‰ª¨ËÆ§‰∏∫Áé∞Âú®ÊîøÂ∫úÁöÑÁªìÊûÑÂ§™ËøáÊ∑∑‰π±ÔºåÊØèÊ¨°ÈÄâ‰∏æÂÆåÊØïÔºåÂè™Ë¶ÅÂá∫Áé∞ÂÖöÊ¥æÁöÑÊõ¥ÊõøÔºåÈÉΩ‰ºö‰ªé‰∏äÂà∞‰∏ãÊç¢‰∏ÄÊâπ‰∫∫ÔºåËÆ©‰∫ãÊÉÖÂèòÂæó‰∏ÄÂõ¢Á≥üÔºåÊïàÁéáÊûÅÂÖ∂‰Ωé‰∏ãÔºåËøô‰∏ç‰ªÖÈÄ†Êàê‰∫ÜÊàò‰∫âÁöÑÂ§±Âà©ÔºåËøòÁªôÊ∞ë‰ºó‰ª¨Â∏¶Êù•‰∫ÜÊûÅÂ§ß‰∏ç‰æø„ÄÇ‚Äù

While Audrey recalled the conversation between her father and elder brother about the situation, she put in her own words, ""They believe that the government's structure is too chaotic. Every election, if there is a change of the ruling party, there will be a change of personnel from top to bottom. It makes things a mess and lowers efficiency tremendously. Not only does it cause the battle loss, it also brings great inconvenience to the civilians.""

Klein knew very well that as there was no example to reference, the Loen Kingdom had yet to evolve into a system that examined public servants. The political situation was still in its preliminary stages; therefore, after every election victory, many so-called positions would be awarded to members and supporters.

**Could translation have less words / more appropriate words?**

Yes.

**Is this faithfully translated with the author's original sentence structure, punctuations, etc?**

Almost. The translator actually made it better by breaking up entire long expositions into proper sentences.

**Is there filler?**

Yes. The first paragraph is Audrey recalling a conversation and talking. Why describe it as a ""self narration / put in her own words""?

The second paragraph is the MC mulling over on Audrey's comments.

How does MC ""know very well that there is no example to reference""?

Why do you even need a ""reference"" to form a better system of government?

Why does the reference use China's regulation that requires civil servants to be frequently re-examed (think of it as continuing education to update/keep your license) ? Almost **all forms of modern govt/public entities** keep base civil servants in place, with annual reviews to weed out underperforming people.

The whole point of MC's paragraph is just to conclude that the system of govt is immature and inefficient! What do all of MC's nonsensical examples have anything to do with Audrey's statement?? It's just pointless words/lore (from China) being thrown in.

And the worst part is that a few paragraphs later, he regurgitates what he just thought of, except this time he ""says"" it out loud. **HOW IS THAT NOT FILLER?**

There's nothing wrong with throwing in Chinese lexicon since the target audience is for China, but it has to make sense and not be irrelevant! Sure a reader from China could instantly grasp the meaning, easily gloss over it, but how are regular readers supposed to do that?

[/spoiler]

-- This is a big issue with the novel. It feels like you're not reading the MC's thoughts. You're reading the author's viewpoint (who is omniscient). The author has 100 different nuggets of lore/info that he probably wrote on scraps of paper. Then he tried to forcefully combine it into chapters. **The sheer mental gymnastics you need to read a chapter carefully is exhausting**, especially after you realize it's just filler.

I get the sense a lot of reviewers have read the Chinese raws and can easily gloss over the problems, but **it's precisely because it was translated into English that all of the problematic content and sentence structures start becoming obvious.**

**(3) Pointlessly complicated world building / more filler**

It's one thing to have filler, it's another thing to try to **disguise it with lousy Dickensian-style**. Author tried to hid filler under nonsensical verbosity, lore and hyper realism.

**Lore/backstory isn't meant to be storytelling.** It's to provide info that will entertain and enlighten a reader. It's meant to connect the dots. There's something very wrong when the first 30 chapters has an info-dump on things that hardly matter. If you want to know how pointlessly complex it gets, google the Lord of the Mysteries wiki page.

**Descriptive realism is just meant to convey the mood and atmosphere to readers.** It's utter s\*upidity when it gets verbose.

[spoiler]Ch 10: The incumbent Prime Minister, Lord Aguesid Negan, went up to the front. He was a member of the Conservative Party and the second non-aristocrat to become the Prime Minister till this very day. He was given the title of a Lord for his great contributions..... The main supporter of the Conservative Party was the present Duke of Negan, Pallas Negan, who was the brother of Aguesid!

Why would you bother introducing a Duke of Negan (never mentioned before) ? Why does it matter that he's the second non-aristocrat? Who gives a sh\*t at this point in the story? That's how all characters are introduced. Comes with their friends, family, dog, servant, father's-mother's-friend's-wife's-niece's-uncle's-nextdoor neighbor's childhood friend.

Ch 10: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe you have witnessed this history-making ironclad warship. It has dimensions of 101 by 21 meters. It has an amazing port and starboard design. The armor belt is 457 millimeters thick. The displacement is 10060 tonnes. There are four 305 millimeter main cannons, six rapid fire cannons, 12 six pound cannons, 18 six barrel machine guns, and four torpedo launchers. It can reach a speed of 16 knot!....

Building out ironclad warship required three big coal and steel amalgamators, a scale of more than twenty steel factories, 60 scientists and senior engineers from the Backlund Cannon Academy and Pritze Nautical Academy, two royal shipyards, almost hundred factories for spare parts, an Admiralty, a ship-building committee, a Cabinet, a determined king with excellent foresight, a great country with an annual steel production of 12 million tonnes!""

I don't even know where to begin on how ridiculous this nonsense is....

Ch 14: Welch's place in Tingen was a detached house with a garden. The road outside the hollowed metal gates allowed four carriages to pass through at once. Street lamps lined the sides of the road every fifty meters. They looked different from the ones Klein had seen in his previous life. They were gas lamps and the heights of every lamp was about that of an adult male so that it was convenient to light the lamps. The black metal was closely oppressed to the glass, forming a checkered pattern, casting out classical paper lantern-like 'artworks'. Coldness and warmth were intertwined while darkness and light coexisted.

Walking along the pathway blanketed by rays from the sunset, Klein and Dunn Smith entered Welch's rented place through the ajar metal gate.

In case it's not obvious, those are just wrought iron gates. I don't know why lantern gas lamps at the height of an adult male are supposedly that unique. They do exist on Earth. Does Welch's place need to be mentioned twice? Or was there confusion earlier when only 1 damn building was mentioned? Does it matter whether it's ajar?

The whole point is just to convey a foreboding atmosphere. What's with all this nonsense?

Ch 18: ""First, mental death... Second, their personality will be changed... Third. Well..."" Dunn put down his pipe and picked up a porcelain cup and took a sip.

""Fermo coffee from the Paz River Valley is bitter... do you want one?""

""I prefer coffee from the Feynapotteau... what's the third outcome?""

-- conversation between MC and secret agent Captain Dunn's when discussing possible side effects of Beyonders who awakened.

It's pretty obvious there's no purpose to the random discussion of coffee, doesn't affect the atmosphere or lead the conversation in a different direction. Just nonsense filler. Even if this info about coffee was somehow useful hundreds of chapters later, what's the point of mentioning it NOW?

[/spoiler]

These are just a few examples. EVERY CHAPTER IS LIKE THIS.

**(4) Tons of sesquipedalia spouted by all characters / even more filler**

This isn't just adopting archaic speech/lexicon, it's annoying name dropping and quotes of fictional gods/beliefs/philosophies that nobody knows about. And you just KNOW it's the author trying to slip in word count. Nothing beats an example.

[spoiler]Ch 15: ""... Second, you're a graduate of the history department from Khoy University, this is something we urgently need. Although a believer of the Lord of the Storms, Leumi, perceives women in a way that is loathsome, his views regarding society, humanities, economics and politics remain incisive. He said before that talents are key to maintaining a competitive advantage and positive development, a point that I very much agree with."" --- spoken by Captain Dunn, an investigative agent, to the MC.

Are you f\*\*king kidding me? Here's EVERYTHING that's wrong is just one short paragraph.

(1) Dunn was NOT being sarcastic.

(2) Dunn is NOT a follower of the Church of Storms (he's with the Church of Evernight). Dunn made ONE off-hand comment in the previous chapter that they would not employ torturous techniques when interrogating MC, unlike the Church of Storms (under the assumption that MC / readers know what the hell he is talking about). No further discussion.

(3) The MC is also NOT a follower of the Church of Storms or any organization and everyone know that.

So why the hell would ANYBODY start discussing philosophies about an entity that isn't related to the situation?

(4) If author just wanted to **introduce readers to the characteristics of Church of Storms followers** (which is clearly what he is doing), then **DO IT IN A LOGICAL APPROPRIATE MANNER**. Have the MC visit the various churches, or meet various believers and let a short exposition or natural dialogue happen. Instead we're constantly treated to random insertions in random conversations, and readers are expected to join all the pieces together to understand the world. That's NOT IMMERSION. That's pointless complication to add word count.

Go read any of the classic Dickensian novels (Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities) or Lord of the Rings and see the difference.

It's as if you were having a conversation with someone and then started randomly quoting maxims from Kant out of the blue. We've seen that happen in other novels and it's PAINFUL.

Again, this nonsense exists throughout the novel.

[/spoiler]

**(5) Illogical plot development / Retcon**

-- MC's powers make no sense. He supposedly stockpiles over 40+ skills by Vol 5 (FYI that c105 is still just halfway through Vol 1....)

Author frequently has to pile on layer after layer of explanations (retcon) to cover it up.

[spoiler]First involves MC using a ritualistic circle (to isekai). Then using the **same ritualistic circle** to summon the Grey Fog and create a virtual communication platform (no longer isekai). Then because the ritualistic circle is obviously too clunky for MC to use in the novel, author decides to have it magically etched onto his hand. No explanation how that happened. So **his superpower only does everything.**

MC realizes his life MIGHT still be threatened after escaping death the first time. DESPITE the fact that joining the Nighthawks as a regular civilian offers MC some measure of protection, MC still **wants** to become a Beyonder (gain **random** special powers through consumption of magic potions, basically ""The Witcher"" or the Grey Wardens in DragonAge). Even though he is repeatedly told a **significant** portion (20+%) of Beyonders go berserk once awakened.

HUH?? So he's taking on MORE risk to avoid the LOW possibility of assassination? Where's the logic in this?

And so author pulls out the **magical card** called ""MC just discovered the original emperor with super Beyonder powers was also an isekai'er, from CHINA! So his ridiculous decision making earlier is negated! MC just needs to follow emperor's footsteps and have MORE reason to become a Beyonder!"".

[/spoiler]

-- MC was going to take a job as a university lecturer. Basically an **Indiana Jones copy**. There were long chapters devoted to his upcoming interview. MC then **suddenly decided not to go**, even though it was repeatedly mentioned he could juggle being a secret agent and a lecturer at the same time (plenty of hours). No reason given. Author probably realized having a side job as a lecturer was pointless.

MC then justifies to his family that he'll be rich with just his secret agent job.

Afterwards (in about... 3 chapters?), MC starts complaining that his single secret agent job salary actually isn't all that much.

I won't even bother hiding this as a spoiler, it's just that s\*upid.

-- Plot development (at least the first arc/vol) comes in the form of 3 strangers (including MC) sitting together in a virtual environment (Grey Fog) after MC called on them by accident. Literally, sitting around exchanging ideas and chatting about what's going on in their part of the world.

Too much to write, I'm giving up. Am tired of constantly having to refer back to the novel to point out problems. Feels like I'm reading SAO all over again.""",0,1757434573.0,writingscaling,7,0.33,False
