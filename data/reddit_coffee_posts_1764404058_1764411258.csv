Connecting w/ people and potential partners felt like something you could do at any moment. Stumbling into on a subway ride or in a wine bar, museum, coffee shop or on a solo night at the climbing gym. I turned 30, traded the noise for mountains, and stepped into a career that’s finally steady beneath my feet. 

Maybe it’s due to the somewhat isolation, need for company or my horny demon, but I got on Feeld, hoping I might cross paths with someone, but it didn’t give me the spark just more options that were too unrealistic. So I’m stepped back. 

I’d rather trust that this new decade will bring the right person into my life in its own timing. I’m choosing patience, trusting God, the universe, and everything in between. And truthfully, I never loved putting my face out there for everyone to scroll past.

*Where Leeds United’s hopes float like a deflated balloon and Manchester City’s dominance is as predictable as a Netflix algorithm.*

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Desperation vs. Dynasty

Let’s crunch the numbers like a Leeds defender crumbles under Haaland’s shoulder. The odds paint a stark picture: **Manchester City** are a near-certainty at **1.22-1.29 decimal odds** (implied probability: **81.9%-85.5%**), while Leeds United are a **9.5-12.0 underdog** (8.3%-9.1%). Even the draw, at **5.5-6.6**, implies a **15.4%-16.7%** chance—about as likely as Leeds’ fans winning the lottery.

The spread? City are favored by **1.5-1.75 goals**, reflecting their expected comfort. The total goals line hovers around **3.25-3.5**, suggesting a high-scoring affair… for Leeds’ misfortune, not City’s generosity.

### Digest the News: A Tale of Two Teams

**Manchester City**: Fresh off two humbling losses to Newcastle and Leverkusen, Pep’s squad is “reeling” like a toddler after their first coffee. But let’s not forget: They just **throttled Leeds 2-0**, with Haaland and Nico Gonzalez silencing the “relegation candidates” narrative. Erling Haaland, their $200 million pin-up, remains the lone striker, flanked by the midfield “glue” of Phil Foden and the “I’ll pivot here, I think” duo of Nico Gonzalez and Silva. Their attack? A well-oiled tank. Their defense? A vault guarded by a swarm of beehives.

**Leeds United**: Ranked 18th, they’ve lost three straight, including a performance so lackluster it made a Tuesday night in Bruges sound exciting. Lukas Nmecha, their “star striker,” is as reliable as a weather vane in a wind tunnel. Wilfried Gnonto and Daniel James? They’re the footballing equivalent of a “ma

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Miami Hurricanes vs. Pittsburgh Panthers: A Tale of Two Offenses (and a Kicker Who’s MIA)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a gridiron clash that’s part chess match, part fireworks show, and part *“Why is the Pittsburgh kicker dressed as the Invisible Man?”* Miami (-285 ML) rolls into Acrisure Stadium as a 7-point favorite, and the numbers suggest they should. But Pitt (+230) isn’t exactly the AFC Championship Game underdog—a team that lost to Notre Dame 37-15 but beat Georgia Tech 42-28 is the football equivalent of a rollercoaster: you never know if you’re about to soar or get stuck at the top.

**Parsing the Odds: Miami’s Precision vs. Pitt’s Peril**  
Let’s start with the math. Miami’s -285 moneyline implies a 74% chance to win, while Pitt’s +230 suggests bookmakers think the Panthers have a 30% shot. That’s a gap wider than the Atlantic Ocean, and it’s rooted in cold, hard stats. The Hurricanes rank 21st in passing yards (275.8/g) and have a red-zone touchdown rate (72.3%) that makes them more reliable than your morning coffee. Pitt? Their defense allows 236.9 passing yards per game (93rd nationally) and lets opponents score TDs 71% of the time in the red zone. If Miami’s offense were a toaster, Pitt’s defense would be the bread—charred, defeated, and in need of a nap.

The spread (-7 for Miami) feels fair but forgiving. Miami’s three-game winning streak includes a 963-yard passing explosion against Virginia Tech, while Pitt’s “win” over Georgia Tech came with 12 players sidelined. The Panthers’ lone silver lining? Their offense averages 49.5 points per game in the Over/Under (set at 50.5). Over the last three meetings, this rivalry has averaged 58 points per game—because these teams play like they’re in a *“Who can throw the ball farther?”* contest.

**News Roundup: Injuries, Kicks, and a Kicker Who’s Not Here**  
Miami’s returning defensive studs David Blay Jr. and OJ Frederique Jr. are like the exorcists of Pittsburgh’s haunte

So yesterday I ordered something small.Flowers for an event to be precise .Guy pulls up, maybe in his early 30s, wearing a faded jacket, helmet that’s seen things, bike looking sooty and dusty . Not in like a baaaad way no 😭 just like a testament that this person is pretty tight scheduled and busy throughout his day 

But he’s smiling , he was quite cute I’m not gonna lie , soft spot for locs I guess🤭 .But Like truly smiling.Not the “customer service” smile the real one. At first I was like….. I’m gonna get hit with the “jambo” or something . 

He hands me my order, and I notice his hand is shaking.I ask him if he’s okay.

He laughs and says madam, nimekulia barabara leo. He tells me that he’s late from another three orders. He then says in his own words “Mtu hawezi choka kama ako na direction.” That line alone stunned me.i almost hit the Cynthia erivo move 😂. But he kept talking, like he’d been holding this in all day. 

So out of it I see one of those cake and coffee guys and I ask if it’s ok if I get some for him since after all he didn’t seem to have any more deliveries …. maybe he had to go back to the shop so it was in my eyes an opening . 
We sit at one of the benches nearby and…… damn . I guess it was the surprise and intrigue on my chubby face and eye contact . He proceeds and he  says ……

“Wasee wa ofisi wanataka freedom. Wanasema wamechoka na kazi. Lakini ukiwapatia free day? Wanakaa tu kwa nyumba kwa blanket. Hiyo sio freedom, hiyo ni comfort. Na comfort haina future.” At the back of my bun I’m like …. Attack ? , rant ? , projection ?. Like where is this guy heading !!!. Then he told me something I’ve been replaying in my mind……

“Freedom ni kama barabara . Hakuna guarantee. Unachagua tu. Na watu wengi hawapendi kuchagua, wanapenda kulalamika.” (I’m really not that proficient in Swahili I’m using basic knowledge over the years so if I’m wrong please correct me 😊). 

We sat  there talking for maybe 5 minutes, but it felt like a whole lecture and I loved it . 

And then he dropped the final one as we head to the gate. 

“Mi niko kwa hii kazi sababu ya mistakes zangu. Lakini niko free. Na hiyo freedom inauma hadi inakuza.”

He said it so calmly.No self-pity. Like no…….. bitterness.
Just acceptance and clarity.

Edric woke to the metallic tang of blood in his throat.

 

Not his own.

 

The dream was vivid - a crumbling citadel under the heat of inferno, a woman's voice screaming his name and a white bearded man frantically running, gasping and holding him.

He opened his eyes, sweating and trembling as he sat up. The Systems notification pulsed in his vision.

 

**\[Warning: Residual memory overlord\]**

 

“Damn it” he muttered, closing the status window. The memories from his sync started bleeding into his dreams. He glanced at his pistol under the pillow and grabbed it tight.

 

Downstairs he heard sounds of a hum, crates being pleased and quiet chatter. Along with the smell of good bread came to his room. The smell almost made him forget his nightmare.

 

Edric stretched his arms , got up and freshened up in the bathroom. He put on the clothes Garrick left him and tucked his gun in the back of his leather pants.

 

Edric descended down the creaky stairs., drawn by the aroma by the freshly baked bread and smoky meat. The tavern was bathed in the warm soft light of dawn. At the counter Garrick was cleaning the mugs and placing some crates in the backroom.

 

“Morning lad” Garrick greeted him with a rough but warm smile .” What happened to you I thought you would sleep till noon”

 

“Couldn't,” Edric replied,his tone clipped. The weight of his nightmares still lingered in his mind but his stomach brought him back to reality.

 

“Need any help around the tavern?” Edric asked Garrick, asking for free stuff didn’t suit his conscience.

 

“Are you any good with a mop?” Garrick replied in a sarcastic tone.

 

“Well I can try, You never know I could be great?” Garrick chuckled at his reply.

 

*Growl*

 

Edric's stomach growled audibly. Garrick let out a small grin from his embarrassment. “Sit down and eat first.” Garrick placed a plate of bread, some meat and mug of beer.

 

Edric hesitated. His instincts—sharpened by memories he couldn’t fully grasp—kept telling him to stay on edge. But hunger won out, and he dropped into a chair. Odd combo of beer for breakfast instead of coffee Edric thought but wasn’t the weirdest thing he saw here..

 

While biting his bread he noticed that the bread here didn’t look like earth's bread. Its texture was more airy and smelled more smoky but it was easily the tastiest bread he had eaten. Even the meat looked like it was cut from an animal he hadn't seen before.

 

The moment of peace didn’t last for long.

 

Few minutes later , the tavern door slammed open abruptly and a gust of cold air swept in. A man in a robe tattered in, his facial features were hidden from the hood all that could be seen was shadow like face- *cough cough.* His cough was rough and bloody, blood stains dropped from his mouth.

 

*SLAM*

 

The robed man dropped face front on the floor and when he dropped blood stains were visible on his back. There was a moment of silence from everyone in the tavern. Then immediately .

 

Edric shot to his feet , his hand instinctively reaching for the pistol tucked in his pants. Garrick moved quickly.“I will handle it” Garrick waved his palm at Edric to calm down.

 

Garrick approached the robed man, he checked his pulse to check if he was dead. The robed man grabbed Garricks arms suddenly. “WHAT THE” Garrick gasped and tried to take his back but strangely the robbed man was stronger than he looked.

 

“There coming” the robbed man spoke in a scared yet mellow tone.

 

“Who’s coming, you crazy man?” Garrick said in an irritating tone still trying to free his hand.

 

“The syndicate– there after someone from house Ve–” The robed man's limbs went limp and dropped dead on the floor.

 

Garrick freed his arm and backed away, his expression grim. Edric stood frozen, his hand still on the pistol. House Ve…? The name tugged at something deep in his memory, fragments of a past he couldn’t quite grasp.

 

“Oi this is the place” A rough voice with malice was heard from outside.

 

“Ya boss. HEHEHE!” A chaotic laughter grew closer to the tavern.

 

Edric glanced at the door. *Slam* The door was barged open, a tall man entered, he had black hair, face full of scars but yet charismatic. His aura made it seem like he was the tavern owner. Garrick stared daggers at him yet the man didn’t seem to care.



His eyes surveyed the surroundings until he focused on the man in the robe.

 

“There’s that bastard,” the man said with confidence like he's a hunter catching his prey.

 

“My tavern has a no strangers policy” Garrick said with a commanding tone, as he approached in front of him. He expanded his chest and stood tall.

 

Garrick with heavy steps, closed the distance between them. He huffed his chest and strained his back to make his figue wide. In a bystander view it was clear the tavern owner was more stronger than the hunter

 

“Looks like you took the hard way, Bruce handle it”. He ordered seemingly to nowhere.

 

*BAAM*

 

In an instant Garrick was knocked a few feet back. Edric gasped, his mind couldn't comprehend what happened in the instant. He turns to look at Garrick.

 

“You mother fucker” Garrick stood up , he pumped his fist.

 

Edric looked in awe as there wasn’t a scratch on Garrick.  
  
“What's taking so long?” A voice that sounded like it came from a bear named Bruce was heard. Edric looked at where it came from. Turns out the man brought his lackeys with him. A humongous man came through the door crouching low enough for his head not to hit the door frame, he didn’t wear a shirt,not like anything would fit him and his muscles were enormous and looked as hard as steel..

 

“Looks like we will have some fun, HEHEHE” A laugh like a hyena came from behind Bruce. He was named Vexis. A man with a slender figure should himself, he had bandages over his body and a laugh like a hyena In the gaps between the bandage, Edric could see what looked like blood and scars.

 

“Holy shit, I better shoot this thing” Edric put his index on the trigger , he focused his eyes on the hunter guy. *He's the boss so if I take him out they will retreat*. He hoped atleast. He was about to lift his gun and strike the trigger. Then–

 

“Hold it” Garrick pats Edric by the shoulder.

 

“This isn’t your fight, kid. There is a way out in the back. If things get messy, get out of here” Garrick told Edric in a reassuring voice. He prepared his fist , bent low in a boxer stance and an aura glowed from his entire body.

 

“Is that magic?” Edric muttered to himself.

 

“Look at him thinks he is tough or something,” Bruce said in a condescending tone.

 

“HEHEHE” Vexis laughed it off, it looked like they took it as a joke.

 

“Listen buddy , hasn't anyone told you not to mess with the syndicate? Just give us the dead guy and we will go off with only a few tables broken.” Cain stood in front of his henchmen.

 

“You think anybody lived when they messed with my tavern. Tauh” Garrick spat at Cain’s boot. Cain’s expression smile frowned to a very grim expression. He turns to his men.

 

“Finish him off” he growled barley containing his anger. He waves his hand and then Bruce comes prepping his fist.

 

The behemoth preped his punch like a hammer . Edric could feel the power from a distance. As he started his punching motion, Edric closed his eyes as his heart trembled.

 

BOOM

 

Edric looked up, his jaw dropped. As he saw Garrick catch the punch. Bruce smile turned to a frown.Vexis couldn’t giggle anymore.

 

“That was the best you got,” Garrick grinned .

 

Garrick lets out a punch of his own only his was stuffed with magic aura. The punch left wind blowing across. Bruce bent his knee, probably the first time he got punched this hard.

 

“That's it you're dead” Bruce stood back up. It looked like it would become a fist fight. Edric's heart began to slow down. The sight of Garrick made him look like a knight in shining armor. But it wasn’t so easy.

 

Garrick tried to throw another punch but it was stopped in mid air. He glances to his fist, bandages were wrapped restricting his movement. As it turned out Vexis could manipulate his bandages like water, he wrapped Garrick's limbs. This brought time for Bruce to unleash fiery of strikes.

 

POW POW

 

Garrick tried his hardest to break free. He unleashed his aura to his entire body but the aura shrinked smaller and smaller.

 

Edric couldnt handle it. He remembered Garricks word to leave from the back but his conscience held him back. He couldn’t let his first friend in this new world die right before his eyes.

Then, Edric didn’t know what came over him. He lifted his pistol, his vision blurred only with man in bandages focused in the epicenter. He pulls the trigger, BAAM. A green light ray was released , the ruins glowed and a melodic hum was heard.

 

The blast was fast and it struck the hyena sending him flying, creasing onto the wall. It didn’t kill him but it knocked him out cold. Garrick was free, he used this opportunity to tackle the gorilla pushing him back.

 

The hunter’s eyes widened , his gasp could be heard.

 

“Woah, so this is marksmanship” Edric could see everyone like a sniper and full focus. He tried to aim at the bear sized man but Garrick was in aim. He surveyed his surroundings, grabbed a bottle and jumped from the tables to land a hit on the gorilla’s head.

 

Edric movements ran automatically, He knew the best steps to take and the way to attack. “How the hell am i doing this” he muttered, then glazed at his screen that popped.

 

**\[Hand to hand combat level 5\]**

**\[Markmanship level 5\]**

 

Garick continued to attack the gorilla, disorienting him. Edric preps his pistol aiming at his torso.

Time slowed.

*It wasn’t a feeling—it was real. The world around Edric blurred as the System’s notification flared in his vision:*

***\[Skill Unlocked\]***

 

Edric glanced to his right, a blade was in chopping motion for his head. Without thinking Edric activates his skill. The blade seemed to phase right through his body.

The hunter was confused , so was Edric. He glanced at his screen.

**\[Skill Unlocked: GhostStep. Duration: 3 seconds.\]**

**Ability:Phase through objects and walls for 5s**

Edric started using his martial arts on the hunter. Garrick was about to finish dealing with his oppnent . if he just stalled for time Garrick could help him.

Edric and Cain started fighting. Despite the hunter having a sword, Edric could block it. The fight looked like a jackie chan film Edric moves unconventional but still worked. Although he could tell as time dragged on, Cain would turn out superior,

At the right moment, he found an opening . He placed his pistol on the hunters chest and pulls the trigger. Cain flys out of the door and smacks the ground.

His shirt was torn and his head was bleeding. He glanced at Edric in frustration. Bruce was knocked over . Garrick hauled him outside, with his hand he tossed the trash outside..

“ Scram you punks,” Garrick yelled loud enough for the streets to hear..

The hunter looked like he wanted a second round but Vexis dropped a smoke bomb. As the smoke dissipates , it is revealed to see the group have vanished.

Edic breathed a sigh of relief but in his mind something told him it wasn’t the last.

“Who were they after” Edric's mind proposed more and more questions.

*Something house Ve-Ve VEYRA* .He realized something.

*House Veyra, Edric Veyra. They're chasing me.*

1p9kx2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1p9kx2o/a_delivery_guy_said_something_i_cant_forget/,A delivery guy said something I can’t … forget 🥹,"Hey loves . So yesterday I ordered something small.Flowers for an event to be precise .Guy pulls up, maybe in his late 20s - early 30s, wearing a faded jacket, helmet that’s seen things, bike looking sooty and dusty . Not in like a baaaad way no 😭 just like a testament that this person is pretty tight scheduled and busy throughout his day in the life as a delivery and service provider .

But he’s smiling , he was quite cute I’m not gonna lie , soft spot for locs I guess🤭 .But Like truly smiling.Not the “customer service” smile the real one. At first I was like….. I’m gonna get hit with the “jambo” or something . 

He hands me my order, and I notice his hand is shaking.I ask him if he’s okay.

He laughs and says madam, nimekulia barabara leo. He tells me that he’s late from another three orders. He then says in his own words “Mtu hawezi choka kama ako na direction.” That line alone stunned me.i almost hit the Cynthia erivo move 😂. But he kept talking, like he’d been holding this in all day. 

So out of it I see one of those cake and coffee guys and I ask if it’s ok if I get some for him since after all he didn’t seem to have any more deliveries …. maybe he had to go back to the shop so it was in my eyes an opening . 
We sit at one of the benches nearby and…… damn . I guess it was the surprise and intrigue on my chubby face and eye contact . He proceeds and he  says ……

“Wasee wa ofisi wanataka freedom. Wanasema wamechoka na kazi. Lakini ukiwapatia free day? . Wanakaa tu kwa nyumba kwa comforter. Hiyo sio freedom, hiyo ni comfort. Na comfort haina future.” At the back of my bun I’m like …. Attack ? , rant ? , projection ?. Like where is this guy heading !!!. Then he told me something I’ve been replaying in my mind……

“Freedom ni kama barabara . Hakuna guarantee. Unachagua tu. Na watu wengi hawapendi kuchagua, wanapenda kulalamika.” (I’m really not that proficient in Swahili I’m using basic knowledge over the years so if I’m wrong please correct me 😊). 

We sat  there talking for maybe 5 minutes, but it felt like a whole lecture and I loved it . 

And then he dropped the final one as we head to the gate. 

“Mi niko kwa hii kazi sababu ya mistakes zangu. Lakini niko free. Na hiyo freedom inauma hadi inakuza.”

He said it so calmly.No self-pity. Like no…….. bitterness.
Just acceptance and clarity.

And I’ve been thinking about him the whole time because… he’s right.

Freedom isn’t comfortable.

Comfort isn’t freedom.
It’s a really puzzling but insightful paradox I would love to hear your thoughts on.

Interesting fact is that my coffee breaks are 3 cups a day and it’s hard for me to stop drinking coffee as well, i get headaches and it would be very hard to stop. 
I’m also on Olanzapin more than 10 years now. (5 mg) As you who take this medicine now this two addiction (smoking and coffin) influence the operating from this drug.

So the last three days i don’t sleep well, I get my 7 hours of sleep, before it was 9 hours. I am tired and sleepy and i don’t know if that’s normal for this big change or the Olanzapin thing is affecting it also.
Do you have maybe experienced something similar? Tried quitting smoking? Or noticed your Olanzapin works different because your coffin usage got smaller or bigger.

I pulled back, maintained it as normal as possible, despite that she kept giving me mixed signals, I shouldn’t have probably read more into it, and  I took a decision to protect myself by reducing contact with her, to almost no contact over a few weeks. Until last month, she started giving me glances across rooms, started initiating conversations, she started opening up to me, her personal problems, i also thought I should open up about my personal life as well, we started reel bombing each other on IG and slowly moved to private messages, where she would hold conversations, I would hold as well, to a point where she tells most of her life to me, sharing little things of her day, food, art, places she’s looking to shift, more than hour long night texting and trauma bonding, we both have a lot going on in our life, but at times she feels really distant and trying to avoid me, and other times she’s very open with, hears me out emotionally, trusts me more with her personal life than her friends or our other colleagues, but at times she goes super silent with hours of no reply, I never push, but I kept hoping she’s taking her time, only to realize I’m again reading this wrong, I clearly conveyed my interest to her earlier this year and she rejected me, then why want to be closer to me now? I’m honestly tired of this push and pull, this entire year has gone like this, and I don’t want to end this year in another disappointment. I’m done with this. I have to accept it and raise my boundaries up again, maybe I might have opened up to her a bit too much. Just like I’ve always done. I was never meant for this. God forbid I like someone normally.

October 27th is the day my world changed. He invited and had a one night stand with a coworker on his living room floor, unprotected at night after work. Right after she left, he called me told me he needs to see me the next morning and then called out of work the next day, he came to my house and he confessed to me right away. It looked like he hasn’t eaten and been crying all night before. 

During the day, things are honestly really good. He’s been showing up – consistent, reassuring, patient, planning dates, answering every single  question, owning what he did. Deleted her off everything. New position at work, he works with his sister so I know he doesn’t ever see that girl. I truly don’t feel like he’s doing anything wrong in the healing process. Some days he struggles but I understand why, being reminded of it isn’t fun but I also have to live with it and that isn’t great either.. but he’s always here and doing 100%. I see that he’s trying and he is going above and beyond, I know that he’s not a bad person, just someone who made a really bad decision in lust. 

The problem is at night.

Something small will trigger me and I just start sobbing. I keep asking the same questions over and over. He still answers them, he’s always answered them, but I can tell it’s starting to wear on him emotionally because I continue to ask the same things and I don’t even know why I’m doing this. He doesn’t ever wanna remember her he hates what he did so much, but I make it worse as I even ask the details of the sex and he doesn’t want to think about it or her ever again. I’m comparing myself to her, that she’s better in bed than me, Shes funnier, Her body is perfect etc.. She got him unprotected and I never have in our 4 years he’s never tried with me, and she got it in one night, I wanna have sex with him but I just think about the fact she had my person, she got to enjoy him and feel him like he was her own. All these emotions - sadness, anger, jealousy, hurt, it’s just non stop. But he’s always reassuring me, he’s always telling me how I’m enough and don’t compare he just made a bad choice he deeply regrets. 

One day my spiral was soo bad, he spent the whole day crying after it and I felt soo guilty but he never stopped holding me, he surprised me and brought me flowers/coffee/breakfast, watched my favorite romance show and cuddled with me all day, he gave me soo many words of reassurance and planned a nice dinner that he cooked and even cut my steak for me and lit up candles and made a bath for me, all the while I could see how much my pain was getting to him. He said all he wants is for me to be happy again not in the bad way but he is seeing the pain I’m dealing with that he caused and it really breaks him. I know he deserves it but I swear he’s doing super good. He’s the only one who pulls me out of my spirals, they used to be all of my emotions but now it’s just crying. And he does an incredible job on making me not cry and pull me out of drowning. He listens to what I need and does it cause he wants me to heal and it’s working. 

I know he chose this burden and deserves to deal with the work and his own guilt HOWEVER I chose to forgive him and try again with us, so I feel guilty that I’m still putting so much emotion pressure on him and I don’t want to make him depressed. I don’t mean to cry from a trigger I’m trying so hard to not let the trigger consume me, it’s always something so random or so little. And I don’t want him to feel punished when he’s genuinely trying, but I also can’t seem to turn off the hurt.

My questions are:
	•	Is it normal to still be crying this hard a month into reconciliation, even when your partner is doing a lot “right”?

	•	How do I handle these night-time waves without dumping every single one on him?

	•	Any coping tools or routines that helped you process the pain without completely draining your partner?

•	anything or advice about triggers cause I honestly feel crazy and alone when they happen especially since it’s been a month? 

TL;DR: Reconciling after his betrayal. He’s showing up and trying hard, we’re good during the day, but at night I get triggered and cry uncontrollably, I ask the same questions, and I feel guilty because it’s taking an emotional toll on him. Looking for advice on how to cope, handle the triggers and not crush him while still being honest about my pain. ",1,1764407875.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

Myy dream is to have my own business one day. Working for someone else, having people boss me around, following rules that aren’t mine… it just doesn’t feel like the life I’m meant for. 

What really messes with me is how everyone talks about “accomplishing things” and how they feel useless if they’re not achieving or climbing the ladder. I don’t feel that at all. I don’t care about accomplishments. I don’t want promotions. I don’t want a fancy title. I’m a hard worker, my appraisals are good, but I have zero desire for any of that.

Work just drains me. I go home exhausted, weekends I’m too tired to do anything, and my whole life is work-home-repeat. I dream about having slow mornings, sitting in a coffee shop reading, going out at night without worrying about waking up early. But working feels like it’s sucking the life out of me.

I am looking at various options which aren't readily available in Thane or nearby locations.

The place has to open by 8 am or so. Budget for F&B is around 500-750 for 2. Maybe a really nice Vietnamese iced coffee along with a pastry/croissant/pie/etc. savoury or sweet, or something I can get packed and bring it back home.

Places I've already visited in the past: Aram, Aaswad, Gaylord's, 210 Bakery, Subko, Mag St., Perch

Current shortlist: Bread Bar, Araku, Mokai, Magnolia

I'm open to any recommendations that can give really really good iced coffees and baked goods.

now I’m her aunt.

Hello people, this will be a ROLLERCOASTER. And disclaimer (no, I did NOT marry my husband just for pure revenge, don’t come for me.) I’ll blur some details because hey you never know… 

My best friend let’s call her Olivia, had been my best friend since middle school. When I was a little immigrant girl from the buttfuck middle of nowhere in Asia and couldn’t speak our native language properly she was the only one who befriended me. After that as dramatic as it sounds we were INSEPARABLE. All throughout high school, and then college and afterwards. 

I met Mark since him and I worked at the same joint in college. He got fired and I was the one he was training to take over his shifts. One thing happened, he asked for my Facebook, yadda yadda and we fell in love and got engaged. I’ll spare you the details and we’ll hop over to the drama. I found out Mark and Olivia were canoodling behind my back five years into our relationship. He was an idiot who didn’t change her contact name to something else and left his phone with me, I went into their messages and scrolled through all of them. One by one. Now, at that time I only found out about this because Olivia was throwing her dad’s birthday party and of course Mark and I were invited. He was too busy retching into the dried out pool while I frantically went to grab napkins from our table and saw Olivia’s notification and message.

Yes. I stepped away to cry like a baby. Then I laugh cried. Then I cried again. I’m sitting bawling my eyes out in the guest bathroom until someone knocks. I’m embarrassed because holy hell everyone is supposed to be outside and I haven’t drank much so I couldn’t even make up an excuse and blame it on the alcohol. 

I freshen up and try to look present and when I open the door I see the most gorgeous man I’ve ever seen in my life and that man is Olivia’s half uncle, Steve. Now Steve is HOT. Always has been even when I was younger, he was Olivia’s dad’s half brother and he was younger. Much cooler as well. He lived abroad, so I had met him around two times maybe on Olivia’s biggest life events. This man asks if I’m okay and I spill my guts out. I’m bawling in this random man’s arms and am completely inconsolable. But also even at that time I thought he was hot so I wasn’t complaining. 

Eventually he calms me down and tells me his ex also cheated on him and that he’s here for me if I need anything. I give him my number and he gives me his because he was very concerned for my mental wellbeing that time because I was in SHAMBLES. I go home that night with Mark. I wake up the next day and go on about my day like nothing happened. I think I’d felt so terrible that my brain kind of numbed my entire body. I went on about my day.

Steve texts me and asks how I’m doing. Texting Steve turns into phone calls with Steve, which turn into coffee with Steve, then walks with Steve. This entire time it was nothing romantic, he was simply helping me out and keeping me sane because he was the only one who knew about me knowing this. I couldn’t even talk to my best friend because she was the one betraying me. 

Mark and I had bought a duplex, but it was in his name. I tell Steve I can’t leave Mark now as much as I want to because the duplex is in his name and I’m just a resident there. Steve offers for me to stay with him at the lake house until I figure things out. I end up a few days later gathering Mark and Olivia to tell them news, I made it out to seem like it was something BIG like a pregnancy announcement. I had packed most of my things by now and left them with Steve, so all I had to do was just drop the bomb.

“I know you’re sleeping together.”

Their faces turn PALE. I can almost physically see their hearts bursting out of their chests. It’s silent, I forgot which one of the opened their mouths to speak first but all I said was. “You two can have each other. Because I’m leaving.” I already had my coat on so I just slipped my sneakers on and left, the entire time the two of them are speechless just sitting there in complete silence and not moving an inch.

Fast forwarding a bit: but they did attempt to come t me. Numerous times. I held my ground.

Staying with Steve made me heal. I cried, I laughed, I vented and went almost clinically insane but he was super chill and nice. Eventually we got closer, and Steve had to go back to the country he lives in. I eventually find an apartment and try to move on, also a shit ton of therapy on my end because I’d not lost one but two of the most important people in my life and it affected my trust for people and still does. Steve and I kept in contact, and he would call, text and make sure to talk to me often. One thing led to another and he would visit more, our meetings went from friendly to romantic. And I really liked him, still do. We get together and do long distance for about a year while both keeping our relationship private until I move abroad with him. A year after that we get engaged and six months later, we’re married?

The kicker? Olivia wasn’t talking to some of her family (for unrelated reasons) so she wasn’t really informed on WHO her uncles bride was. Just that it was a woman he’d met in our city and fell in love with. We had a beautiful wedding in Nice, my dream wedding that Steve made a reality and had done everything to accommodate for me. But one thing was for sure, I knew Mark and Olivia would be there.

The moment I walked down the aisle? I kid you not, Olivia excused herself to go vomit while Mark sat there awkwardly. I got to hear afterwards from Steve’s best man that she had a panic attack and couldn’t stop vomiting and crying in the venues bathroom and Mark had to take her home because she was pale and inconsolable. Also that she was venting to herself during her breakdown and calling me all names in the book. And rumour has it (I don’t know if this is entirely true) but apparently I traumatised her ‘so hard’ that she has to taken benzodiapines for the rest of her life. Her and Mark are still together, but keep breaking up and getting back together over and over again and adopting a different dog breed every month to keep themselves sane. 

A few years later and I’m married to Steve now. He’s the most loving and gentle man out there and he is hilarious. He’s become not only my partner but my best friend. We live in a beautiful beach town somewhere warm in Europe with a baby on the way. I definitely did not marry him for the sole purpose of getting back at Olivia and Mark, their karma is being together because they’re horrible people but family whispers tell me she’s taking severe anxiety medication aka benzodiazepines because of the ‘trauma’ 😂. 

I’m doing much better and have made new friends that have stuck by my side and a husband who loves me and has been through my worst moments with me (quite literally.) 

My story and advice to all of you: No matter how dirty someone does you, life will always find a way for you to bite them back in the ass. For me? It was fate making me become my ex best friends AUNTIE and ex fiancées aunt in law lol. We do send Christmas cards just to be petty and make sure the family groupchats are filled with selfies. ;)

I was in a terrible headspace. Burned out, low energy. I was walking around in the Hauz Khas metro station and almost went home. Decided to do one last set to get the reps in.

Stopped a girl who was giving me eyes, but she was basically completely silent. You know the type... typical guarded Delhi girl. Introverted, suspicious, hard shell. Usually, this kills my vibe. But I was so tired I just said, ""You being this quiet is making me nervous."" She actually laughed. The ""attitude"" dropped instantly. We went for a quick coffee. She was walking close, sharing my drink. Green lights.

Here is the problem every guy in this city deals with: Where do we actually go? I text my usual Airbnb. Booked. I can't take her home (family/flatmates situation). This is the moment where 90% of dates in Delhi die.

I started panicking internally. But the training kicked in. I didn't say ""Chalo ghar chalte hain."" I told her we were checking out a ""hidden terrace"" I knew across town. I secretly booked a decent hotel in Karol Bagh (far, but available) and called an auto.

If you date in Delhi, you know you’re gonna spend half your life in a cab or auto. The ride was 45 minutes of pure traffic. I realized: This is the date. If I sat there silent, it was over. So I escalated. Held her hand. She squeezed back. Moved closer. Kissed her neck. Next thing I know we’re making out in the back seat while stuck at a red light. By the time we reached the hotel, it didn't feel ""sleazy"" because the comfort was already built in the auto.

We get the room. And honestly? I was shaking. The pressure of actually pulling off a same-day lay, plus the logistics stress... I had total ED (Performance Anxiety).

Old me would have apologized and made it awkward. But I relied on the system:

1- No Apologies: I didn't make it a big deal.

2- Focus on her: I just focused on foreplay and making her feel good.

3- Wait it out: I knew if I relaxed, it would come back. Because I didn't panic, she stayed cool. The pressure dropped, and eventually, we finished.

I used to think you needed a luxurious pull place in Gurgaon or a massive car to do a same-day lay in this city. Bullshit. I was a nervous wreck with bad logistics and a limp dick. But I had a structure.
- Logistics fail? Don't freeze. Pivot to a hotel and frame it as an adventure.
- Stuck in traffic? That's your escalation window. Use it.
- Anxiety? Don't apologize. Focus on the girl until you relax.

If you are living in Delhi/NCR and you're letting ""logistics"" or ""parents at home"" stop you, you're just making excuses. The system works if you work it.",1,1764407181.0,PickUpArtist,2,1.0,False

I started panicking internally. But the training kicked in. I didn't say ""Chalo ghar chalte hain."" I told her we were checking out a ""hidden terrace"" I knew across town. I secretly booked a decent hotel in Karol Bagh (far, but available) and called an auto.

If you date in Delhi, you know you’re gonna spend half your life in a cab or auto. The ride was 45 minutes of pure traffic. I realized: This is the date. If I sat there silent, it was over. So I escalated. Held her hand. She squeezed back. Moved closer. Kissed her neck. Next thing I know we’re making out in the back seat while stuck at a red light. By the time we reached the hotel, it didn't feel ""sleazy"" because the comfort was already built in the auto.

We get the room. And honestly? I was shaking. The pressure of actually pulling off a same-day lay, plus the logistics stress... I had total ED (Performance Anxiety).

Old me would have apologized and made it awkward. But I relied on the system:

1- No Apologies: I didn't make it a big deal.

2- Focus on her: I just focused on foreplay and making her feel good.

3- Wait it out: I knew if I relaxed, it would come back. Because I didn't panic, she stayed cool. The pressure dropped, and eventually, we finished.

I used to think you needed a luxurious pull place in Gurgaon or a massive car to do a same-day lay in this city. Bullshit. I was a nervous wreck with bad logistics and a limp dick. But I had a structure.
- Logistics fail? Don't freeze. Pivot to a hotel and frame it as an adventure.
- Stuck in traffic? That's your escalation window. Use it.
- Anxiety? Don't apologize. Focus on the girl until you relax.

If you are living in Delhi/NCR and you're letting ""logistics"" or ""parents at home"" stop you, you're just making excuses. The system works if you work it.",1,1764407039.0,daygame,0,1.0,False

We'd been to all the typical spots in our city, and I wanted to surprise her with something more memorable.

I remembered she mentioned loving scavenger hunts as a kid, so I decided to create a custom one around our neighborhood. I spent a week planning it out - picking meaningful locations from our previous dates, creating clues that referenced inside jokes, and mapping out a route that ended at this scenic overlook she'd mentioned wanting to visit.

The setup was simple: I texted her the first clue when she got off work, and each location had another clue waiting (I hid them earlier that day). The clues led her to:
- The coffee shop where we had our first date
- The bookstore where we spent 2 hours talking about our favorite authors
- The park bench where we had our first real conversation
- Finally, the overlook where I was waiting with a picnic

What made it special wasn't just the surprise element - it was that she got to revisit all these places that had become ""ours"" over the past few months. She said it was the most thoughtful date she'd ever been on because it showed I'd been paying attention to all the little things.

The whole thing took maybe 90 minutes, cost less than $50 (mostly the picnic food), and created way more memories than another expensive restaurant would have.

If you're looking to shake things up and show someone you care about the details, I highly recommend trying something like this. It doesn't have to be elaborate - even 4-5 stops with personal touches can make it really special.

Has anyone else tried something similar? Would love to hear other creative date ideas that go beyond the typical options.",1,1764406884.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

i can’t remember exactly how it went down but that was when i realized i definitely have a different idea of friendship compared to NTs bc i can’t for the life of me just randomly reach out to someone for a drink under the pretense of catching up UNLESS if we were planning to do cafe hopping / try out a new food or sth like that. i understand that is what friendship is normally like but honestly still find the idea pretty strange bc if i REALLY wanna catch up w someone, i can just do it via text/phone or we text first about our plan and go do activities together and then we catch up about life while doing said activities. the idea of catching up being the main activity is so strange to me 😭",4,1764406686.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False

That's a whole different dessert.

Gets ko naman na pwedeng mag-substitute, kung walang ladyfingers pwedeng sponge cake (like most restaurants 'yan ang gamit) or other kinds of cookies na pwedeng ma-soak sa coffee. Kung walang mascarpone, creamcheese (I tried it, masarap naman medyo tangy lang)

Tayo nga meron tayong mango graham float. Paano kung tinawag 'yang Mango Graham Tiramisu, eh 'di wala tayong pinagmamalaking dessert ngayon.

Hi, I’m 37M, 5’7, I wear glasses. I work from home for both EU and US companies, so weekdays are usually packed and I’m often glued to my desk. Pag weekends naman, I actually remember I’m a human being and I like going out, exploring new spots, or simply grabbing coffee to unwind. I’m a foodie who appreciates simple but cute dates and anything that feels genuine.

I’m Catholic if that matters to you, and I used to be a church keyboardist and guitarist. I can sing too, so yes, harana is definitely on the table if you’re into that. I enjoy trying new things, whether it’s a new café, a random restaurant, or something spontaneous that makes weekends more exciting.

When it comes to relationships, I appreciate someone who communicates well, updates naturally, and knows how to handle things with maturity. I value emotional intelligence and calm conversations because they make everything smoother. I’m not into drama and I prefer things simple, steady, and clear.

About You

I’m hoping to meet someone petite, chinita, at maputi, ideally between 27 to 35 years old, with a stable job and living within Metro Manila. Bonus points if you’re from North Caloocan or QC. It would be great if you’re also a foodie and someone who enjoys trying new things.

I read the group rules and hope this kind of post is okay here.

I’m working on a small 30‑day project helping local coffee shops understand how they show up on Google Maps in their own neighborhood. Instead of big SEO reports, I’m manually checking how a cafe ranks at a few nearby street corners and turning it into a simple red / yellow / green map plus a couple of quick suggestions.

For those of you who own or manage a coffee shop:

* How do you currently check if people a few blocks away can actually see you on Google Maps?
* Have you ever found that you’re #1 near your shop but basically invisible just a few streets over?

I’m looking for feedback from real coffee shop owners on whether this kind of ‘hyper‑local’ visibility view is useful, and what you’d actually want to see in a 2‑minute report on your phone.

I have this guy. He has worked for the company for 25 years but transferred to my dept a few months ago due to his dept closing down. He was my level in his dept and I can now see how it’s closed down. There’s a number of things he should have done by now. He hasn’t. I gave him a list of things he needs to do asap. 

Task one- should take an hour. I sent him the list on Tuesday. Tuesday afternoon he quizzed me on the task and I showed him and did an example. Wednesday afternoon he spent all his time quizzing my staff on the task. He took at least an hour of 3 of my staffs time explaining. Thursday morning he completed half the task in 6 hours. I was in a room next door with clients while he and 2 of my staff members were in the office. He wouldn’t leave them alone. I arrived 45 minutes early that morning. I sit with my breakfast and coffee chatting none related work stuff with my staff. 5 minutes before I needed to prep for the clients coming in he pulls me up angry as we were chatting none related work stuff (before work started) and he needed me. As well as quizzing them he came in my room where the clients were and quizzed me. I gave him another example. He had to write a few lines about each of his clients (this was the task). He’s so self absorbed he doesn’t know about his own clients and had done it all wrong. I could do it off the top of my head with one of his clients I shouldn’t know because I don’t work with them directly. He said how do you know that? We talk a lot in the office and it’s mostly client based. If you listen you get to know other peoples. One of my other staff took the client one day and told me about them. He thinks he’s above this office chatter and puts his earphones in all the time. This is fine all my staff shove their earphones in including me from time to time. But if you don’t know what’s going on you need them earphones out. 

Anyways he did 1 task this week that should have taken an hour. I had clients on Thursday and finished with them at 2. I knew he was up there and armed with questions so I sat in one of the other offices and worked. Me and my staff are getting annoyed with him. On Thursday morning I told the 2 staff to either come work in the corner of my room where my clients were or go in another room but they shouldn’t feel they can’t work in the office. It’s like having a baby. There’s no point in wasting hours of mine and my staffs time when we are busy as he’s leaving at Christmas. He doesn’t work Friday and as he left Thursday he left really late he said to me “I’m gonna have to work all day on my day off” with a sad face like I should be thankful. I’ve got an exit meeting with him and he’s not getting his final salary unless he’s done his job. All these tasks are so small and easy.

I will attend 8 social Meetup events and form genuine friendships with 5 new people, exchanging contact info and meeting them outside organized events.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Week 1: Join 5 Meetup groups (hiking, board games, book club), RSVP to 2 events this week, prepare conversation starters.  
Week 2: Attend 2 events, initiate conversations with 5+ people per event, exchange Instagram/phone numbers with 2-3 connections.  
Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Meetup event check-in screenshots — proof of attendance at 8 events with timestamps.
2. Text message screenshots (names redacted) — showing conversations and plans with 5 different people.
3. Photos from one-on-one meetups — 5 separate coffee/lunch meetings outside organized events (faces can be blurred for privacy).
4. Group chat screenshot — showing active conversation with minimum 5 new contacts.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Social anxiety at events → attend with accountability partner first time, prepare 3 conversation starters, arrive 10 min early to ease in.  
People not following through → reach out to 10+ people to account for drop-off, don't take personally, focus on genuine connections.  
Schedule conflicts → prioritize weekends, block calendar every Saturday for Meetup events.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Updates twice weekly in comments: Days 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28. Share number of events attended, connections made, follow-up progress.

I am SO unbelievably tired of Kez. Every time I queue up for a nice normal game of Dota 2, this feather-brained anime assassin pops out of a bush with 47 different utility mechanics like he’s auditioning for a new job every two seconds. Why does this hero have a dash, a grapple, a stun, a silence, a slow, invisibility, lifesteal, TRUE STRIKE, a parry that COUNTERS ME LIKE IT’S A FIGHTING GAME, damage over time, crits, TWO ULTS, TWO SETS OF ABILITIES, a dispel, debuff immunity, 100% magic resistance, and probably a tax-deductible business expense?

WHEN DID DOTA BECOME A CHARACTER ACTION GAME?
WHY AM I FIGHTING BAYONETTA WITH A HEALTH REGEN DEBUFF??

Every time I think I’ve caught him, nope! He presses one of his 38 mobility buttons, becomes invisible, dispels half my net worth, reverses the polarity of my atoms, and walks away like he’s late for a coffee date. Meanwhile I’m staring at my hero with FOUR ABILITIES like an idiot from 2013.

so, that phil wickham show on 12/02 is totally sold out, which is awesome, but it means the parking situation at water of life church is going to be a complete mess, especially for a 7:00 pm event. figured i'd share the insider parking strategies to save you a major headache.  
  
first, and honestly the best kept secret, you should check out Prked. this is an app where people who live right next to the venue rent out their driveways or private garage spots for the evening. it's usually way cheaper than what you'd pay for a commercial lot or one of those sneaky pop-up lots, plus you get to skip 99% of the church lot traffic when you’re leaving and just take a short, peaceful walk to the front door. you can book it now for a guaranteed spot.  
  
if you’re going for the official venue parking, know the church’s system is designed to prioritize certain people. the main parking structure on campus is strictly limited to handicapped guests, parents with strollers, and first-time visitors. the east avenue entrance is for handicapped guests only. if you've been before, you will be directed to the overflow parking lots south of the campus - lots ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"".  
  
lot a is where you want to aim if you don’t mind a short wait, because it offers a shuttle service right to the campus. lot b is the walking lot, which is generally a short-but-fast option for people who are physically able and want to skip the shuttle line both ways. since this is a sold out show, those lots are going to fill up incredibly fast and the traffic on east avenue and surrounding streets will be backed up for a long time.  
  
the key here is timing: for a 7:00 pm start, i would recommend arriving no later than 5:30 pm, maybe even 5:00 pm, to get a decent spot in lot a or b without a major wait. traffic in the area will build starting around 5:30 pm because it's right after the end of the work day and before the event rush. the extra hour lets you relax, grab a coffee at the wol cafe, and find your seats without stressing.  
  
i’d strongly advise against trying to find street parking in the residential neighborhoods around the church. fontana has some strict parking rules, like a four-hour limit for oversized vehicles, and while that may not apply to your sedan, the residential areas are not setup for mass event parking and you run the risk of getting a ticket or being towed by a grumpy neighbor. stick to the official overflow lots or book a spot with Prked.  
  
hope this helps you have a smooth and awesome night at the concert!",1,1764404551.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

> Stayed in my childhood bedroom that has been unaltered since I was a kid even though I’m now in my 30s (normally I’d have lots of shooters packed away in my bags and take them randomly throughout the day)

> Was triggered by being around family 24/7 and being “on” for 4 days (normally I’d need to “go for drives” and lie about where I was going because I was restocking my secret liquor stash because it was never enough)

> Listened to my ill-behaved nieces and nephews scream and whine when they didn’t get their way at every family gathering (normally I’d want to have a few strong drinks and just disassociate from the chaos)

> Stayed up late on black Wednesday playing board games (normally I’d be closing down the bar)

> Watched the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade and began cooking thanksgiving morning with a coffee in hand (normally it would be mimosa-o-clock [easy on the OJ] because it’s a holiday aka the perfect excuse to start drinking at 10am)

> Survived thanksgiving dinner without wine (normally I’d bring a few bottles and one or two would have my name on them)

> Called my partner every night and had amazing conversations (normally our conversations would be an awful blend of me trying not to sound like I was drunk on the phone and potentially getting overly emotional about something that didn’t even make sense)

> Went to my hometown dive bar and ordered a soda water (normally I’d drink double vodkas, get drunk, and catch up with my old friends in the most superficial way possible)

> Ran into my ex who I haven’t seen or talked to in nearly a decade and they were super rude to me (if there was ever a drinking trigger….)

After getting drunk every single day for the better part of the past decade, I knew thanksgiving was going to be intense. And that was putting it lightly, especially after spending the first couple of weeks being sober in my sober bubble at home.

There were dozens and dozens of triggers all weekend. But do what you’ve always done, and get what you’ve always gotten.

I DID NOT DRINK. 

Instead, I’m officially closing out 3 weeks sober today. I didn’t feel I missed out on anything. Instead, I was FULLY present. I got to enjoy (and remember) every moment. I slept amazingly every night, had zero regrets, and no morning panic attacks about what happened at the end of the night before. 

And the strange thing was, it really wasn’t that difficult. I was too proud of myself in every little moment I’d normally be triggered in to let myself down. Every obstacle I face I see as an opportunity for growth and to rewire my brain to finding beauty and joy in places that were there all along.. but now they aren’t mucked up by poison.

I’m actually starting to build a beautiful life. And I’m so excited for THAT to be my new normal. 🤍🤍🤍

ABYG? I (M35) have this bestfriend (M35) for 23 years. We met during high school, we clicked and naging super close until college and naging professionals on our own fields. We were so close that we made it to a point na we have to see each other at least once a week over coffee or anything when we were still living sa homecity namin (probinsya).

Time came na he got a job in another city and I made some time multiple times to visit him, gala kami and I would stay at his place. And when he got an offer in Makati, he decided to settle na since he has found a partner na din and good pay na din sa new job nya. I would usually visit him sa Makati (at least 3x/year), gala and stay sa place nya. And whenever na uuwi siya sa homecity namin, usual routine is magkikita kami, minsan kasama pa pamilya nya, and hatid ko pa siya/sila sa bahay niya/nila everytime kahit lasing ako or kahit early morning na from party/bar. Mind you, hindi malapit bahay nila sa city and sa bahay ko.

Until ako naman nagka job offer here in Quezon City. Initially we were excited kasi magkalapit na ulit kami. But since I got settled in, we were only able to see each other 5x for the past 9 months, always na ako yung pumupunta ng Makati or just because may common friend kami who’s in Manila for work na magkikita-kita. He refuses to go to QC after multiple times I have invited him and his partner over kasi “sobrang malayo” daw. One time, pumunta sila ng Cubao and magkikita daw kami because may errand daw sila sa Cubao, so naging side agenda lang ako for their reason to go to QC (na hurt ako dun); we met up and nagpalambing ako na hatid naman nila ako since I only live 7 mins away from where we ate dinner, but they refused kasi “malayo” daw. Wala akong car here in Manila, iniwan ko na sa province kasi parang impractical for me with the limited pay sa current job ko.

As someone who just transferred here in Manila with limited to no contacts/friends, I was expecting for him to step up for me sana as I stood up to visit him (via air/sea) before when he transferred to new cities. I just find it unfair and decided to go cold na muna since he seems comfortable sa current life stage niya and sa jowa nya while I’m taking this time na lang din to rediscover myself while I’m in a new unfamiliar place with no friends to see. Taking it as a life restart—it’s refreshing but sad most of the time.

I have issues making a V60 for 2 people and I would rather not do 2 separate cups. 
Firstly I think double the coffee is way too much and produces much too strong flavour. Usually I reduce to about 20-22gs coffee for the 500ml water. 

It's probably not built for 2 cups but I wonder what the experience is from this community about making 500ml water in V60. I find I get clogging more often with this amount as well and this is exacerbated by more coffee grounds. 

Also pouring. Usually I just try to pour a whole 250 ml in the first pour then do another 2 pours to get up to 500.

I've spent more than a decade in the service industry, rotating through roles as a barista, bartender, and server. 
I've never understood the major tipping gap between breakfast and dinner shifts. I choose to work mornings because I prefer an early schedule and prioritize my sleep, but the financial difference is baffling.
Why do people consistently tip more at dinner than they do for breakfast?
Ironically, breakfast is usually far more work—managing coffee refills, more sides, and more check-ins. I'm happy to get $5 per person at breakfast. Yet, someone ordering just a burger and a soda at lunch might tip me $10. And along comes dinner, where I can have 6 tables throughout the night and make the same I did at breakfast with 2-3x more guests. The pricing isn't the issue, so it's not simply about the check size. (This is generally true before complex dinner drink/appetizer orders complicate things, which is the only time dinner truly feels harder.)
The confusion extends to bartending. I recently earned a $7 tip just for pouring a single shot—a sum higher than what I'd made during a whole morning of full-service breakfast work.
What is the rationale behind tipping a quick pour or a simple lunch order significantly more than a demanding breakfast service?

I’ve been trying to perfect this pour with my V60, but time after time all I get is dull banana and quite a bitter coffee taste. I’ve made adjustments to temp, grind size, pour pattern, and ratio all yielding similar results. Until I changed the brewer method, from V60 to Kalita Wave (using 155 ruffled paper). This has changed completely this cup. It is silky smooth, banana punches the air before I even lift the carafe or cup, there is a lovely creaminess of milk chocolate in the after taste.

This got me thinking, how quick do you guys n gals think about switching the brewer type if you’re not getting what you think from your usual approach? I only recently got the Kalita in a BF sale.

Wala akong car here in Manila, iniwan ko na sa province kasi parang impractical for me with the limited pay sa current job ko.

As someone who just transferred here in Manila with limited to no contacts/friends, I was expecting for him to step up for me sana as I stood up to visit him (via air/sea) before when he transferred to new cities. I just find it unfair and decided to go cold na muna since he seems comfortable sa current life stage niya and sa jowa nya while I’m taking this time na lang din to rediscover myself while I’m in a new unfamiliar place with no friends to see. Taking it as a life restart—it’s refreshing but sad most of the time.
