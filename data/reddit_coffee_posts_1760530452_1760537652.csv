It started a few months ago, the day my Grandpa died.

I’d been to enough funerals to know the rhythm—black clothes, hollow condolences, that heavy air of finality.

It was all too familiar.

That day, I learned Grandpa left me his house, but he left me something else, too.

A plain white envelope with just two words scribbled on the front: Read Carefully.

Inside was a note that would change my life.

It read:

To My Grandson, Nathan —

If you're reading this, it means I’ve failed and that I’m no longer here to see you become the man I always hoped you would be.

There’s something that you need to know about our family. Something that I’ve kept from you your whole life to protect you.

You’ve inherited more than just a house; you’ve inherited a family secret.

There’s a door upstairs in the attic that sits in the middle of the room. You haven’t seen it yet, but you will. It’s a door that chooses to show itself to you and once it does — your life will never be the same.

It only appears to the men in our bloodline. I couldn’t explain it to your grandmother or your mother. They thought I was crazy because they could never see it like I could.

I’ve managed to keep the door locked away for over sixty years so that your father could raise you and give you the childhood I never could for him.

Every night of my life was spent standing in front of that door and making sure it stayed closed because if no one is watching, it opens.

It can’t ever open.

That’s why this next part is important. You need to heed these rules, no matter what.

Do not open the door no matter what you hear.
You must be standing or sitting in front of it. You cannot be more than 10 feet away.
When the voice behind the door speaks, do not respond.
Do not close your eyes unless you want to open them again.
Always remain at your post. You can sleep when the sun rises.
There will be more and when they appear, you need to be ready.

The door is always watching and learning you. Your resolve will be tested.

I won’t sugarcoat things, if you fail, you will die.

That can’t happen, for if the door is left unguarded, the world will be in grave danger.

I hope you’re stronger than I ever was, Nathan.

I believe in you, good luck.

Love, Grandpa Bill

The note shook me to my core.

I’d always looked up to Grandpa Bill.

He was my last real connection to my parents—both of whom died in a house fire when I was seventeen.

I never got to say goodbye, and I never had closure.

My grandmother passed a year later, and after that, I was left with a few distant relatives who barely remembered I existed.

But Grandpa? He made me feel like I still belonged somewhere, like I hadn’t been completely forgotten.

Losing him felt like losing the last piece of myself that still remembered what “home” meant.

For a while, I didn’t even want to be in the house — the memories, the silence, all of it felt wrong.

But I had to be strong—just like he would’ve wanted.

I couldn’t let the door win.

I moved into the house immediately and that night is when my duty began.

As soon as the sun went down, I took my Grandpa’s note with me and went upstairs to the attic.

When I reached the top of the stairs, I laid eyes upon the door for the first time.

It stood in the middle of the room, and its crimson red wood was warped and shone faintly in the moonlight from a small window nearby.

Scratches ran across the surface—deep gouges like something had tried to claw its way out… or in.

I sat a few feet away, not daring to get closer.

It just stood there—silent and still for now.

But I couldn’t shake the question that lingered in the back of my mind:

Why was my family given such a peculiar task?

The longer I stared at the door, the more it felt like staring into an answer I didn’t want.

The silence pressed against me, thick and waiting.

Nothing happened for the first few hours, but a little after midnight, I heard a knock.

At first, I thought it might have been my imagination, but I heard it again.

This time, it was louder, heavier, and unmistakably coming from the door in front of me.

I fell backwards and watched the door shake from how hard the knocking had become.

Eventually, the knocking stopped, but the air was… moving.

It wasn’t wind, it was slow, warm, and rhythmic.

The door was breathing.

Each damp, sour exhale brushed my face — the smell of decay curling like smoke.

I backed up but remembered not to go too far away from the door.

I didn’t say a word or move again until the sun came up.

When the light finally touched the door, it stopped breathing.

That’s how it was for the first week.

Life outside the attic felt paper-thin — the price of a routine I was still learning to survive.

My coworkers started noticing—the dark circles, the zoning out during meetings, the way I’d flinch whenever someone tapped me on the shoulder.

One of them joked that I looked like I was living in a haunted house.

I laughed, but I didn’t correct them.

I burned dinner twice, forgot my neighbor’s name when we crossed paths, and nearly drifted off behind the wheel at a red light.

Then the sounds started following me.

The fridge humming downstairs began to sound like chattering teeth.

My reflection lingered a little longer than it should have.

Sometimes I’d catch myself whispering the rules—not to remember them, but to convince the door I still believed in them.

It felt like a pact, like a ritual I couldn’t escape.

With every repetition the rules grew heavier.

They stopped feeling like protection and started feeling like chains.

Everything real was starting to feel fake, and the only things that felt real were the voices and the door.

Day after day, night after night, my life split in two.

One under the sun, the other in the dark.

By day, I’m just another exhausted office drone.

By night, I’m the gatekeeper.

Work eight to five, eat, sleep if I can, climb the stairs, watch the door until sunrise, and repeat.

Every night blurred into the next until time itself felt like another rule I had to obey.

I almost started to believe the door would never change.

On the eighth night, I heard the voice behind the door speak for the first time.

“Do not be afraid.”

It didn’t sound threatening, in fact, it had a gentle tone that only made it all that more disturbing.

I remember walking up to the door and standing in front of it, my pulse erratic as my body shivered slightly.

A part of me wanted to open the door and put a name to the voice, but I remembered my Grandpa’s note.

“Do not be afraid.” It said it again, softer this time.

I followed the third rule: listen without answering.

So, I stood there, shaking, listening to that voice.

As the hours dragged on, I kept thinking about how my Grandpa sat in the attic every night.

Did he deal with the same things I’m dealing with?

How did he deal with listening to the voice?

Asking myself questions is how I would pass the time watching the door in the dark.

It kept my mind sharp during the monotonous ritual of watching the door from sundown to sunrise.

That’s what it was like for about a week.

Routine had almost made the horror feel ordinary, and that’s when it decided to change the rules.

Right before I went upstairs one night, I saw it—another line on my Grandpa’s note that hadn’t been there before.

In frantic handwriting it said:

6. If it cries, ignore it.

From then on, each night only got worse.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

I wanted to help, anything to make the cries stop.

I almost whispered, “Are you okay?”

But the rule was clear.

Ignore it.

So I did.

In response, the floorboards near the door had darkened, and the air around it shimmered like heat off asphalt.

Whatever was behind that door, it wasn’t just growing stronger—it was changing the world around it.

I could feel it noticing me more each night.

And then, as if sensing my fear, the rules changed again.

A couple of weeks later, just before I made my way upstairs, I noticed some new lines had been written on the note.

7. It will show you things. Do not believe them.

8. It will tell you the future, but it’s all a lie.

The ink looked fresh this time, like someone — or something — had written them just moments before I came upstairs.

They didn’t make sense to me—not until the door made me understand.

It didn’t scream or cry like it had before.

Instead, it spoke calmly about the things that awaited me in the future.

“You’re going to become head of your department Nathan. You’ll fall in love and have three children, Elise, Michael, and Jonah.”

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.

“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision.

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it.

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate.

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence.

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Its words filled the darkness, and shadows moved all around in shapes I recognized.

My Grandpa appeared next to me, but not the one I saw in the casket in the funeral, but the youthful one from old photographs.

“Grandson…” he whispered in a voice that almost sounded like his.

I didn’t speak; I couldn’t, even though I wanted to very badly.

My dad waved at me and told me how proud he was of me.

My mom smiled and beckoned for me to open the door so we could be reunited as a family.

I leaned in front of the door, my hand on the knob about to turn it…when I saw something blink in the keyhole.

It was an eye—black and moist, sliding sideways watching me, refusing to blink.

I stumbled back, and the whispers stopped.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

But even in the stillness, something was shifting.

I used the flashlight on my phone to keep myself from nodding off in the early hours of the morning.

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light.

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

Every night I felt myself unravel a little more.

My thoughts weren’t just mine anymore—they had a different voice.

The door wasn’t just trying to break through—it was trying to break in, as if wanting to listen closer to what I have to say.

Maybe that’s why the rules kept getting more difficult each night—it knew my thoughts before I did.

Before I went upstairs one time, I found two new rules written in the steam on the bathroom mirror.

They read:

9. It will try to bargain. Do not accept.

10. Do not believe the sounds you will hear. It will do anything to make you leave your post.

I thought I understood the rules …until the early hours of the morning, when it didn’t knock, but begged profusely.

“Nathan…let me out. Please, just once. I can make it stop.”

But I wasn’t hearing just the voice of the door, I was hearing screams of my parents.

They were as gut-wrenching as they were familiar and I heard them coming from downstairs, then outside, then under the floorboards.

A moment later, I smelled smoke.

It was faint at first, but the smell of burnt wood and melting plastic filled the air.

I nearly bolted downstairs, my body ready to run and save them, but then I remembered the rule telling me not to believe the sounds I’m hearing.

The door was toying with me by digging into the deepest trauma it could find.

I clenched my fists and stared at the door unmoving.

It spoke in my mom’s voice, then my dad’s, then Grandpa’s—sometimes weaving all three into one seamless, haunting sentence.

Then, it spoke in my voice, in the same tremble I’ve heard in myself every night since I moved in.

“Please…let me out…let me out….I just want out…”

Frozen in place, I endured its begging for hours.

My body screamed for a break, even just the relief of closing my eyes.

I was losing focus fast, the kind of fatigue that makes your eyes twitch just to stay open.

I had to do something.

A desperate plan surfaced — a way to trick it, maybe.

Hoping to cheat the rules, I angled a mirror across from me — one eye could rest while the other kept watch.

For a time, it worked.

Until the reflection shifted.

In the mirror, the door stood wide open.

Something slithered out on all fours — gray-skinned and scaly, bones cracking with each movement.

Its head tilted toward me, not in curiosity, but in mimicry — like it was practicing being human.

I snapped my eyes to the real door —the real door was still shut tight, breathing.

When I looked back, the mirror was empty—except for five wet fingerprints smeared downward, like someone had leaned against it from the inside.

I sat there for a long time after that.

The lantern burned out, but I couldn’t bring myself to light another one.

I kept thinking about my Grandpa, standing in this same spot for sixty years, his eyes fixed on the same door, watching it breathe, whisper, and beg.

Did he ever think about just walking away?

I think about leaving every night.

I think about the stairs behind me, about sunlight, about sleep.

But then I remember what my Grandpa asked of me.

My responsibility is what keeps me here, and the fear of what happens if I stop watching.

When morning came, I didn’t remember falling asleep.

I only remembered the mirror, and the way those fingerprints stained it.

To drown out the noise, I fixated on one impossible question: how did Grandpa carry this burden for decades?

The more I thought about it, the more I feared the real answer: maybe he didn’t.

For a while, nothing really changed outside of my routine, the knocking, and the voices pleading behind the door.

That is until some more rules appeared on the page.

11. A single moment of inattention is all it needs. Do not falter.

12. Do not fall asleep in front of the door.

At this point, I was delirious and running on fumes.

I could barely stay awake at work, and I was averaging maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night.

There’s only so much coffee and energy drinks can do for your body before it stops working as effectively.

There was one instant where my eyes almost fluttered shut—and I swear I felt something brush against my cheek.

The knocking started again—but it wasn’t coming from the door anymore, it was coming from behind me.

I spun around, nearly tripping over the lantern.

Then the walls, the window, and even the ceiling above me all echoed with that knocking sound.

The door would shake, the voices would scream, I’d see my loved ones begging for me to open the door, but I wouldn’t.

The voice behind the door would speak things to me like:

“Do not be afraid. Open the door Nathan and I will make all of this stop.”

I ignored it.

At around 3 a.m., my phone started ringing across the floorboards.

The screen said:

GRANDPA.

Seeing his smiling face on the screen shattered something in me—because I knew he was dead.

Despite the feeling in my gut telling me not to, I answered.

Nothing about the rules said that I couldn’t take a phone call.

“Nathan,“ His voice crackled through the phone speaker.

“You’ve done enough, my boy. Let me take your place. Go downstairs and rest now.”

My thumb hovered over the screen, my heart thudding as I remembered the other voices, the lies.

I ended the call.

The phone rang nonstop until sunrise.

Hours later, a new rule appeared—one that nearly broke me.

In slanted, sloppy letters was the worst one I had seen yet:

13. Eventually, you will fail. Fight it off for as long as you can.

I read that line over and over until the ink blurred.

The words didn’t feel like a warning anymore — they felt like a countdown.

Not just because of what it said — but because of what it didn’t.

Maybe this is what Grandpa meant…

Maybe failure isn’t about opening the door—it’s about how long you can last before you want to.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.

The last few nights, l’ve been hearing slow, deliberate footsteps behind the door, and the floorboards creaking in time with my own heartbeat.

I keep telling myself none of it’s real, that I’m still the one in control.

But the longer I watch, the more I notice the door wasn’t where it used to be.

Last week, I marked its position on the floor with painter’s tape to signify a border I wouldn’t cross.

I checked last night, and the tape was gone, and the door had moved.

It had only moved just a few inches at first and it made me think that maybe I was imagining it.

After all, I was running on empty in terms of sleep.

But night after night, it kept inching closer.

It didn’t drag or creak—it just... shifted, like it wanted to be closer to me.

I measured the gap once — ten feet, then eight, then six. I stopped checking after that.

The space between me and it was shrinking, and I swear I could feel the heat of its breath on my face.

Sometimes, the floorboards sank a little beneath it, like it was pressing down with weight.

Whatever was behind it was coming for me.

This discovery led to another rule appearing:

14. No matter how close the door gets to you, do not touch it.

I didn’t plan on it.

I was too tired to plan anything anymore — just existing felt like a strategy in itself.

Last night, I swear I saw something move beneath the wood, like a hand pressing out.

I think my Grandpa’s sixty years only bought us time, and now, that time is almost gone.

He kept whatever this thing is locked away for decades and now it’s my turn.

One day, it will become somebody else’s.

I don’t want them to suffer like I and the men in my family before me have.

My hands won’t stop trembling.

I haven’t slept in days.

I’ve started hallucinating—at least, I hope they’re hallucinations.

I swear I saw the attic walls breathing last night.

I wonder if the door is even real.

Maybe I’ve lost my mind—trapped in a psych ward, mumbling while unseen eyes watch through glass.

I can hear them all.

My parents, Grandpa, myself.

They all speak from behind the door and the longer I listen, the more their words sound like truth.

A new rule appeared, carved directly into the attic floor, just in front of where I sit:

15. When your eyes close for the last time, the door will open from the inside.

I don’t know if I’m protecting the world from what’s behind the door or if I’m looking after it so it can’t escape before it’s ready.

Maybe that’s what Grandpa meant when he said he failed — not that he lost… but that he finally understood what he was guarding.

And yet, he kept watching.

So now I do too.

There’s one rule Grandpa never wrote.

If the door ever stops whispering… it means it’s already won.

My parents call to me now.

And now—

Another rule:

16. You will forget which side of the door you’re on.

If Grandpa could still see me now, I hope he knows I tried.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.

“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision.

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it.

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate.

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence.

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light.

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

Every night I felt myself unravel a little more.

My thoughts weren’t just mine anymore—they had a different voice.

The door wasn’t just trying to break through—it was trying to break in, as if wanting to listen closer to what I have to say.

Maybe that’s why the rules kept getting more difficult each night—it knew my thoughts before I did.

Before I went upstairs one time, I found two new rules written in the steam on the bathroom mirror.

They read:

9. It will try to bargain. Do not accept.

10. Do not believe the sounds you will hear. It will do anything to make you leave your post.

I thought I understood the rules …until the early hours of the morning, when it didn’t knock, but begged profusely.

“Nathan…let me out. Please, just once. I can make it stop.”

But I wasn’t hearing just the voice of the door, I was hearing screams of my parents.

They were as gut-wrenching as they were familiar and I heard them coming from downstairs, then outside, then under the floorboards.

A moment later, I smelled smoke.

It was faint at first, but the smell of burnt wood and melting plastic filled the air.

I nearly bolted downstairs, my body ready to run and save them, but then I remembered the rule telling me not to believe the sounds I’m hearing.

The door was toying with me by digging into the deepest trauma it could find.

I clenched my fists and stared at the door unmoving.

It spoke in my mom’s voice, then my dad’s, then Grandpa’s—sometimes weaving all three into one seamless, haunting sentence.

Then, it spoke in my voice, in the same tremble I’ve heard in myself every night since I moved in.

“Please…let me out…let me out….I just want out…”

Frozen in place, I endured its begging for hours.

My body screamed for a break, even just the relief of closing my eyes.

I was losing focus fast, the kind of fatigue that makes your eyes twitch just to stay open.

I had to do something.

A desperate plan surfaced — a way to trick it, maybe.

Hoping to cheat the rules, I angled a mirror across from me — one eye could rest while the other kept watch.

For a time, it worked.

Until the reflection shifted.

In the mirror, the door stood wide open.

Something slithered out on all fours — gray-skinned and scaly, bones cracking with each movement.

Its head tilted toward me, not in curiosity, but in mimicry — like it was practicing being human.

I snapped my eyes to the real door —the real door was still shut tight, breathing.

When I looked back, the mirror was empty—except for five wet fingerprints smeared downward, like someone had leaned against it from the inside.

I sat there for a long time after that.

The lantern burned out, but I couldn’t bring myself to light another one.

I kept thinking about my Grandpa, standing in this same spot for sixty years, his eyes fixed on the same door, watching it breathe, whisper, and beg.

Did he ever think about just walking away?

I think about leaving every night.

I think about the stairs behind me, about sunlight, about sleep.

But then I remember what my Grandpa asked of me.

My responsibility is what keeps me here, and the fear of what happens if I stop watching.

When morning came, I didn’t remember falling asleep.

I only remembered the mirror, and the way those fingerprints stained it.

To drown out the noise, I fixated on one impossible question: how did Grandpa carry this burden for decades?

The more I thought about it, the more I feared the real answer: maybe he didn’t.

For a while, nothing really changed outside of my routine, the knocking, and the voices pleading behind the door.

That is until some more rules appeared on the page.

11. A single moment of inattention is all it needs. Do not falter.

12. Do not fall asleep in front of the door.

At this point, I was delirious and running on fumes.

I could barely stay awake at work, and I was averaging maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night.

There’s only so much coffee and energy drinks can do for your body before it stops working as effectively.

There was one instant where my eyes almost fluttered shut—and I swear I felt something brush against my cheek.

The knocking started again—but it wasn’t coming from the door anymore, it was coming from behind me.

I spun around, nearly tripping over the lantern.

Then the walls, the window, and even the ceiling above me all echoed with that knocking sound.

The door would shake, the voices would scream, I’d see my loved ones begging for me to open the door, but I wouldn’t.

The voice behind the door would speak things to me like:

“Do not be afraid. Open the door Nathan and I will make all of this stop.”

I ignored it.

At around 3 a.m., my phone started ringing across the floorboards.

The screen said:

GRANDPA.

Seeing his smiling face on the screen shattered something in me—because I knew he was dead.

Despite the feeling in my gut telling me not to, I answered.

Nothing about the rules said that I couldn’t take a phone call.

“Nathan,“ His voice crackled through the phone speaker.

“You’ve done enough, my boy. Let me take your place. Go downstairs and rest now.”

My thumb hovered over the screen, my heart thudding as I remembered the other voices, the lies.

I ended the call.

The phone rang nonstop until sunrise.

Hours later, a new rule appeared—one that nearly broke me.

In slanted, sloppy letters was the worst one I had seen yet:

13. Eventually, you will fail. Fight it off for as long as you can.

I read that line over and over until the ink blurred.

The words didn’t feel like a warning anymore — they felt like a countdown.

Not just because of what it said — but because of what it didn’t.

Maybe this is what Grandpa meant…

Maybe failure isn’t about opening the door—it’s about how long you can last before you want to.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.

The last few nights, l’ve been hearing slow, deliberate footsteps behind the door, and the floorboards creaking in time with my own heartbeat.

I keep telling myself none of it’s real, that I’m still the one in control.

But the longer I watch, the more I notice the door wasn’t where it used to be.

Last week, I marked its position on the floor with painter’s tape to signify a border I wouldn’t cross.

I checked last night, and the tape was gone, and the door had moved.

It had only moved just a few inches at first and it made me think that maybe I was imagining it.

After all, I was running on empty in terms of sleep.

But night after night, it kept inching closer.

It didn’t drag or creak—it just... shifted, like it wanted to be closer to me.

I measured the gap once — ten feet, then eight, then six. I stopped checking after that.

The space between me and it was shrinking, and I swear I could feel the heat of its breath on my face.

Sometimes, the floorboards sank a little beneath it, like it was pressing down with weight.

Whatever was behind it was coming for me.

This discovery led to another rule appearing:

14. No matter how close the door gets to you, do not touch it.

I didn’t plan on it.

I was too tired to plan anything anymore — just existing felt like a strategy in itself.

Last night, I swear I saw something move beneath the wood, like a hand pressing out.

I think my Grandpa’s sixty years only bought us time, and now, that time is almost gone.

He kept whatever this thing is locked away for decades and now it’s my turn.

One day, it will become somebody else’s.

I don’t want them to suffer like I and the men in my family before me have.

My hands won’t stop trembling.

I haven’t slept in days.

I’ve started hallucinating—at least, I hope they’re hallucinations.

I swear I saw the attic walls breathing last night.

I wonder if the door is even real.

Maybe I’ve lost my mind—trapped in a psych ward, mumbling while unseen eyes watch through glass.

I can hear them all.

My parents, Grandpa, myself.

They all speak from behind the door and the longer I listen, the more their words sound like truth.

A new rule appeared, carved directly into the attic floor, just in front of where I sit:

15. When your eyes close for the last time, the door will open from the inside.

I don’t know if I’m protecting the world from what’s behind the door or if I’m looking after it so it can’t escape before it’s ready.

Maybe that’s what Grandpa meant when he said he failed — not that he lost… but that he finally understood what he was guarding.

And yet, he kept watching.

So now I do too.

There’s one rule Grandpa never wrote.

If the door ever stops whispering… it means it’s already won.

My parents call to me now.

And now—

Another rule:

16. You will forget which side of the door you’re on.

If Grandpa could still see me now, I hope he knows I tried.

It started a few months ago, the day my Grandpa died.

I’d been to enough funerals to know the rhythm—black clothes, hollow condolences, that heavy air of finality.

It was all too familiar.

That day, I learned Grandpa left me his house, but he left me something else, too.

A plain white envelope with just two words scribbled on the front: Read Carefully.

Inside was a note that would change my life.

It read:

To My Grandson, Nathan —

If you're reading this, it means I’ve failed and that I’m no longer here to see you become the man I always hoped you would be.

There’s something that you need to know about our family. Something that I’ve kept from you your whole life to protect you.

You’ve inherited more than just a house; you’ve inherited a family secret.

There’s a door upstairs in the attic that sits in the middle of the room. You haven’t seen it yet, but you will. It’s a door that chooses to show itself to you and once it does — your life will never be the same.

It only appears to the men in our bloodline. I couldn’t explain it to your grandmother or your mother. They thought I was crazy because they could never see it like I could.

I’ve managed to keep the door locked away for over sixty years so that your father could raise you and give you the childhood I never could for him.

Every night of my life was spent standing in front of that door and making sure it stayed closed because if no one is watching, it opens.

It can’t ever open.

That’s why this next part is important. You need to heed these rules, no matter what.

Do not open the door no matter what you hear.
You must be standing or sitting in front of it. You cannot be more than 10 feet away.
When the voice behind the door speaks, do not respond.
Do not close your eyes unless you want to open them again.
Always remain at your post. You can sleep when the sun rises.
There will be more and when they appear, you need to be ready.

The door is always watching and learning you. Your resolve will be tested.

I won’t sugarcoat things, if you fail, you will die.

That can’t happen, for if the door is left unguarded, the world will be in grave danger.

I hope you’re stronger than I ever was, Nathan.

I believe in you, good luck.

Love, Grandpa Bill

The note shook me to my core.

I’d always looked up to Grandpa Bill.

He was my last real connection to my parents—both of whom died in a house fire when I was seventeen.

I never got to say goodbye, and I never had closure.

My grandmother passed a year later, and after that, I was left with a few distant relatives who barely remembered I existed.

But Grandpa? He made me feel like I still belonged somewhere, like I hadn’t been completely forgotten.

Losing him felt like losing the last piece of myself that still remembered what “home” meant.

For a while, I didn’t even want to be in the house — the memories, the silence, all of it felt wrong.

But I had to be strong—just like he would’ve wanted.

I couldn’t let the door win.

I moved into the house immediately and that night is when my duty began.

As soon as the sun went down, I took my Grandpa’s note with me and went upstairs to the attic.

When I reached the top of the stairs, I laid eyes upon the door for the first time.

It stood in the middle of the room, and its crimson red wood was warped and shone faintly in the moonlight from a small window nearby.

Scratches ran across the surface—deep gouges like something had tried to claw its way out… or in.

I sat a few feet away, not daring to get closer.

It just stood there—silent and still for now.

But I couldn’t shake the question that lingered in the back of my mind:

Why was my family given such a peculiar task?

The longer I stared at the door, the more it felt like staring into an answer I didn’t want.

The silence pressed against me, thick and waiting.

Nothing happened for the first few hours, but a little after midnight, I heard a knock.

At first, I thought it might have been my imagination, but I heard it again.

This time, it was louder, heavier, and unmistakably coming from the door in front of me.

I fell backwards and watched the door shake from how hard the knocking had become.

Eventually, the knocking stopped, but the air was… moving.

It wasn’t wind, it was slow, warm, and rhythmic.

The door was breathing.

Each damp, sour exhale brushed my face — the smell of decay curling like smoke.

I backed up but remembered not to go too far away from the door.

I didn’t say a word or move again until the sun came up.

When the light finally touched the door, it stopped breathing.

That’s how it was for the first week.

Life outside the attic felt paper-thin — the price of a routine I was still learning to survive.

My coworkers started noticing—the dark circles, the zoning out during meetings, the way I’d flinch whenever someone tapped me on the shoulder.

One of them joked that I looked like I was living in a haunted house.

I laughed, but I didn’t correct them.

I burned dinner twice, forgot my neighbor’s name when we crossed paths, and nearly drifted off behind the wheel at a red light.

Then the sounds started following me.

The fridge humming downstairs began to sound like chattering teeth.

My reflection lingered a little longer than it should have.

Sometimes I’d catch myself whispering the rules—not to remember them, but to convince the door I still believed in them.

It felt like a pact, like a ritual I couldn’t escape.

With every repetition the rules grew heavier.

They stopped feeling like protection and started feeling like chains.

Everything real was starting to feel fake, and the only things that felt real were the voices and the door.

Day after day, night after night, my life split in two.

One under the sun, the other in the dark.

By day, I’m just another exhausted office drone.

By night, I’m the gatekeeper.

Work eight to five, eat, sleep if I can, climb the stairs, watch the door until sunrise, and repeat.

Every night blurred into the next until time itself felt like another rule I had to obey.

I almost started to believe the door would never change.

On the eighth night, I heard the voice behind the door speak for the first time.

“Do not be afraid.”

It didn’t sound threatening, in fact, it had a gentle tone that only made it all that more disturbing.

I remember walking up to the door and standing in front of it, my pulse erratic as my body shivered slightly.

A part of me wanted to open the door and put a name to the voice, but I remembered my Grandpa’s note.

“Do not be afraid.” It said it again, softer this time.

I followed the third rule: listen without answering.

So, I stood there, shaking, listening to that voice.

As the hours dragged on, I kept thinking about how my Grandpa sat in the attic every night.

Did he deal with the same things I’m dealing with?

How did he deal with listening to the voice?

Asking myself questions is how I would pass the time watching the door in the dark.

It kept my mind sharp during the monotonous ritual of watching the door from sundown to sunrise.

That’s what it was like for about a week.

Routine had almost made the horror feel ordinary, and that’s when it decided to change the rules.

Right before I went upstairs one night, I saw it—another line on my Grandpa’s note that hadn’t been there before.

In frantic handwriting it said:

6. If it cries, ignore it.

From then on, each night only got worse.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

I wanted to help, anything to make the cries stop.

I almost whispered, “Are you okay?”

But the rule was clear.

Ignore it.

So I did.

In response, the floorboards near the door had darkened, and the air around it shimmered like heat off asphalt.

Whatever was behind that door, it wasn’t just growing stronger—it was changing the world around it.

I could feel it noticing me more each night.

And then, as if sensing my fear, the rules changed again.

A couple of weeks later, just before I made my way upstairs, I noticed some new lines had been written on the note.

7. It will show you things. Do not believe them.

8. It will tell you the future, but it’s all a lie.

The ink looked fresh this time, like someone — or something — had written them just moments before I came upstairs.

They didn’t make sense to me—not until the door made me understand.

It didn’t scream or cry like it had before.

Instead, it spoke calmly about the things that awaited me in the future.

“You’re going to become head of your department Nathan. You’ll fall in love and have three children, Elise, Michael, and Jonah.”

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.

“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision.

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it.

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate.

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence.

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Its words filled the darkness, and shadows moved all around in shapes I recognized.

My Grandpa appeared next to me, but not the one I saw in the casket in the funeral, but the youthful one from old photographs.

“Grandson…” he whispered in a voice that almost sounded like his.

I didn’t speak; I couldn’t, even though I wanted to very badly.

My dad waved at me and told me how proud he was of me.

My mom smiled and beckoned for me to open the door so we could be reunited as a family.

I leaned in front of the door, my hand on the knob about to turn it…when I saw something blink in the keyhole.

It was an eye—black and moist, sliding sideways watching me, refusing to blink.

I stumbled back, and the whispers stopped.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

But even in the stillness, something was shifting.

I used the flashlight on my phone to keep myself from nodding off in the early hours of the morning.

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light.

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

He said he was promoting a gym and added, “Hey, miss, we’re offering free trial classes. You look really fit, you must be into working out, right?”

She didn’t want to seem rude, so she politely asked what kind of classes they were offering. He started explaining, but when she grabbed her coffee and wanted to leave, he kept following her, talking nonstop. Then he asked, “If you’re interested, can I get your number?”  
She turned around and said firmly, “No, thank you. Please don’t follow me, sir”  
But he didn’t stop. He kept walking behind her until she finally called an uber and left, heart pounding and body tense the whole time.

That night, at dinner with her family, she told them what happened. Her brother laughed and said, “Look, you were probably wearing something too revealing, that’s why he approached you.”

She snapped: “Why is what I wear the issue here? The problem is that guy following me, not my clothes!”

It started a few months ago, the day my Grandpa died.

I’d been to enough funerals to know the rhythm—black clothes, hollow condolences, that heavy air of finality.

It was all too familiar.

That day, I learned Grandpa left me his house, but he left me something else, too.

A plain white envelope with just two words scribbled on the front: Read Carefully.

Inside was a note that would change my life.

It read:

To My Grandson, Nathan —

If you're reading this, it means I’ve failed and that I’m no longer here to see you become the man I always hoped you would be.

There’s something that you need to know about our family. Something that I’ve kept from you your whole life to protect you.

You’ve inherited more than just a house; you’ve inherited a family secret.

There’s a door upstairs in the attic that sits in the middle of the room. You haven’t seen it yet, but you will. It’s a door that chooses to show itself to you and once it does — your life will never be the same.

It only appears to the men in our bloodline. I couldn’t explain it to your grandmother or your mother. They thought I was crazy because they could never see it like I could.

I’ve managed to keep the door locked away for over sixty years so that your father could raise you and give you the childhood I never could for him.

Every night of my life was spent standing in front of that door and making sure it stayed closed because if no one is watching, it opens.

It can’t ever open.

That’s why this next part is important. You need to heed these rules, no matter what.

Do not open the door no matter what you hear.
You must be standing or sitting in front of it. You cannot be more than 10 feet away.
When the voice behind the door speaks, do not respond.
Do not close your eyes unless you want to open them again.
Always remain at your post. You can sleep when the sun rises.
There will be more and when they appear, you need to be ready.

The door is always watching and learning you. Your resolve will be tested.

I won’t sugarcoat things, if you fail, you will die.

That can’t happen, for if the door is left unguarded, the world will be in grave danger.

I hope you’re stronger than I ever was, Nathan.

I believe in you, good luck.

Love, Grandpa Bill

The note shook me to my core.

I’d always looked up to Grandpa Bill.

He was my last real connection to my parents—both of whom died in a house fire when I was seventeen.

I never got to say goodbye, and I never had closure.

My grandmother passed a year later, and after that, I was left with a few distant relatives who barely remembered I existed.

But Grandpa? He made me feel like I still belonged somewhere, like I hadn’t been completely forgotten.

Losing him felt like losing the last piece of myself that still remembered what “home” meant.

For a while, I didn’t even want to be in the house — the memories, the silence, all of it felt wrong.

But I had to be strong—just like he would’ve wanted.

I couldn’t let the door win.

I moved into the house immediately and that night is when my duty began.

As soon as the sun went down, I took my Grandpa’s note with me and went upstairs to the attic.

When I reached the top of the stairs, I laid eyes upon the door for the first time.

It stood in the middle of the room, and its crimson red wood was warped and shone faintly in the moonlight from a small window nearby.

Scratches ran across the surface—deep gouges like something had tried to claw its way out… or in.

I sat a few feet away, not daring to get closer.

It just stood there—silent and still for now.

But I couldn’t shake the question that lingered in the back of my mind:

Why was my family given such a peculiar task?

The longer I stared at the door, the more it felt like staring into an answer I didn’t want.

The silence pressed against me, thick and waiting.

Nothing happened for the first few hours, but a little after midnight, I heard a knock.

At first, I thought it might have been my imagination, but I heard it again.

This time, it was louder, heavier, and unmistakably coming from the door in front of me.

I fell backwards and watched the door shake from how hard the knocking had become.

Eventually, the knocking stopped, but the air was… moving.

It wasn’t wind, it was slow, warm, and rhythmic.

The door was breathing.

Each damp, sour exhale brushed my face — the smell of decay curling like smoke.

I backed up but remembered not to go too far away from the door.

I didn’t say a word or move again until the sun came up.

When the light finally touched the door, it stopped breathing.

That’s how it was for the first week.

Life outside the attic felt paper-thin — the price of a routine I was still learning to survive.

My coworkers started noticing—the dark circles, the zoning out during meetings, the way I’d flinch whenever someone tapped me on the shoulder.

One of them joked that I looked like I was living in a haunted house.

I laughed, but I didn’t correct them.

I burned dinner twice, forgot my neighbor’s name when we crossed paths, and nearly drifted off behind the wheel at a red light.

Then the sounds started following me.

The fridge humming downstairs began to sound like chattering teeth.

My reflection lingered a little longer than it should have.

Sometimes I’d catch myself whispering the rules—not to remember them, but to convince the door I still believed in them.

It felt like a pact, like a ritual I couldn’t escape.

With every repetition the rules grew heavier.

They stopped feeling like protection and started feeling like chains.

Everything real was starting to feel fake, and the only things that felt real were the voices and the door.

Day after day, night after night, my life split in two.

One under the sun, the other in the dark.

By day, I’m just another exhausted office drone.

By night, I’m the gatekeeper.

Work eight to five, eat, sleep if I can, climb the stairs, watch the door until sunrise, and repeat.

Every night blurred into the next until time itself felt like another rule I had to obey.

I almost started to believe the door would never change.

On the eighth night, I heard the voice behind the door speak for the first time.

“Do not be afraid.”

It didn’t sound threatening, in fact, it had a gentle tone that only made it all that more disturbing.

I remember walking up to the door and standing in front of it, my pulse erratic as my body shivered slightly.

A part of me wanted to open the door and put a name to the voice, but I remembered my Grandpa’s note.

“Do not be afraid.” It said it again, softer this time.

I followed the third rule: listen without answering.

So, I stood there, shaking, listening to that voice.

As the hours dragged on, I kept thinking about how my Grandpa sat in the attic every night.

Did he deal with the same things I’m dealing with?

How did he deal with listening to the voice?

Asking myself questions is how I would pass the time watching the door in the dark.

It kept my mind sharp during the monotonous ritual of watching the door from sundown to sunrise.

That’s what it was like for about a week.

Routine had almost made the horror feel ordinary, and that’s when it decided to change the rules.

Right before I went upstairs one night, I saw it—another line on my Grandpa’s note that hadn’t been there before.

In frantic handwriting it said:

6. If it cries, ignore it.

From then on, each night only got worse.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

I wanted to help, anything to make the cries stop.

I almost whispered, “Are you okay?”

But the rule was clear.

Ignore it.

So I did.

In response, the floorboards near the door had darkened, and the air around it shimmered like heat off asphalt.

Whatever was behind that door, it wasn’t just growing stronger—it was changing the world around it.

I could feel it noticing me more each night.

And then, as if sensing my fear, the rules changed again.

A couple of weeks later, just before I made my way upstairs, I noticed some new lines had been written on the note.

7. It will show you things. Do not believe them.

8. It will tell you the future, but it’s all a lie.

The ink looked fresh this time, like someone — or something — had written them just moments before I came upstairs.

They didn’t make sense to me—not until the door made me understand.

It didn’t scream or cry like it had before.

Instead, it spoke calmly about the things that awaited me in the future.

“You’re going to become head of your department Nathan. You’ll fall in love and have three children, Elise, Michael, and Jonah.”

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.

“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision.

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it.

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate.

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence.

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Its words filled the darkness, and shadows moved all around in shapes I recognized.

My Grandpa appeared next to me, but not the one I saw in the casket in the funeral, but the youthful one from old photographs.

“Grandson…” he whispered in a voice that almost sounded like his.

I didn’t speak; I couldn’t, even though I wanted to very badly.

My dad waved at me and told me how proud he was of me.

My mom smiled and beckoned for me to open the door so we could be reunited as a family.

I leaned in front of the door, my hand on the knob about to turn it…when I saw something blink in the keyhole.

It was an eye—black and moist, sliding sideways watching me, refusing to blink.

I stumbled back, and the whispers stopped.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

But even in the stillness, something was shifting.

I used the flashlight on my phone to keep myself from nodding off in the early hours of the morning.

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light.

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

Every night I felt myself unravel a little more.

My thoughts weren’t just mine anymore—they had a different voice.

The door wasn’t just trying to break through—it was trying to break in, as if wanting to listen closer to what I have to say.

Maybe that’s why the rules kept getting more difficult each night—it knew my thoughts before I did.

Before I went upstairs one time, I found two new rules written in the steam on the bathroom mirror.

They read:

9. It will try to bargain. Do not accept.

10. Do not believe the sounds you will hear. It will do anything to make you leave your post.

I thought I understood the rules …until the early hours of the morning, when it didn’t knock, but begged profusely.

“Nathan…let me out. Please, just once. I can make it stop.”

But I wasn’t hearing just the voice of the door, I was hearing screams of my parents.

They were as gut-wrenching as they were familiar and I heard them coming from downstairs, then outside, then under the floorboards.

A moment later, I smelled smoke.

It was faint at first, but the smell of burnt wood and melting plastic filled the air.

I nearly bolted downstairs, my body ready to run and save them, but then I remembered the rule telling me not to believe the sounds I’m hearing.

The door was toying with me by digging into the deepest trauma it could find.

I clenched my fists and stared at the door unmoving.

It spoke in my mom’s voice, then my dad’s, then Grandpa’s—sometimes weaving all three into one seamless, haunting sentence.

Then, it spoke in my voice, in the same tremble I’ve heard in myself every night since I moved in.

“Please…let me out…let me out….I just want out…”

Frozen in place, I endured its begging for hours.

My body screamed for a break, even just the relief of closing my eyes.

I was losing focus fast, the kind of fatigue that makes your eyes twitch just to stay open.

I had to do something.

A desperate plan surfaced — a way to trick it, maybe.

Hoping to cheat the rules, I angled a mirror across from me — one eye could rest while the other kept watch.

For a time, it worked.

Until the reflection shifted.

In the mirror, the door stood wide open.

Something slithered out on all fours — gray-skinned and scaly, bones cracking with each movement.

Its head tilted toward me, not in curiosity, but in mimicry — like it was practicing being human.

I snapped my eyes to the real door —the real door was still shut tight, breathing.

When I looked back, the mirror was empty—except for five wet fingerprints smeared downward, like someone had leaned against it from the inside.

I sat there for a long time after that.

The lantern burned out, but I couldn’t bring myself to light another one.

I kept thinking about my Grandpa, standing in this same spot for sixty years, his eyes fixed on the same door, watching it breathe, whisper, and beg.

Did he ever think about just walking away?

I think about leaving every night.

I think about the stairs behind me, about sunlight, about sleep.

But then I remember what my Grandpa asked of me.

My responsibility is what keeps me here, and the fear of what happens if I stop watching.

When morning came, I didn’t remember falling asleep.

I only remembered the mirror, and the way those fingerprints stained it.

To drown out the noise, I fixated on one impossible question: how did Grandpa carry this burden for decades?

The more I thought about it, the more I feared the real answer: maybe he didn’t.

For a while, nothing really changed outside of my routine, the knocking, and the voices pleading behind the door.

That is until some more rules appeared on the page.

11. A single moment of inattention is all it needs. Do not falter.

12. Do not fall asleep in front of the door.

At this point, I was delirious and running on fumes.

I could barely stay awake at work, and I was averaging maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night.

There’s only so much coffee and energy drinks can do for your body before it stops working as effectively.

There was one instant where my eyes almost fluttered shut—and I swear I felt something brush against my cheek.

The knocking started again—but it wasn’t coming from the door anymore, it was coming from behind me.

I spun around, nearly tripping over the lantern.

Then the walls, the window, and even the ceiling above me all echoed with that knocking sound.

The door would shake, the voices would scream, I’d see my loved ones begging for me to open the door, but I wouldn’t.

The voice behind the door would speak things to me like:

“Do not be afraid. Open the door Nathan and I will make all of this stop.”

I ignored it.

At around 3 a.m., my phone started ringing across the floorboards.

The screen said:

GRANDPA.

Seeing his smiling face on the screen shattered something in me—because I knew he was dead.

Despite the feeling in my gut telling me not to, I answered.

Nothing about the rules said that I couldn’t take a phone call.

“Nathan,“ His voice crackled through the phone speaker.

“You’ve done enough, my boy. Let me take your place. Go downstairs and rest now.”

My thumb hovered over the screen, my heart thudding as I remembered the other voices, the lies.

I ended the call.

The phone rang nonstop until sunrise.

Hours later, a new rule appeared—one that nearly broke me.

In slanted, sloppy letters was the worst one I had seen yet:

13. Eventually, you will fail. Fight it off for as long as you can.

I read that line over and over until the ink blurred.

The words didn’t feel like a warning anymore — they felt like a countdown.

Not just because of what it said — but because of what it didn’t.

Maybe this is what Grandpa meant…

Maybe failure isn’t about opening the door—it’s about how long you can last before you want to.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.

The last few nights, l’ve been hearing slow, deliberate footsteps behind the door, and the floorboards creaking in time with my own heartbeat.

I keep telling myself none of it’s real, that I’m still the one in control.

But the longer I watch, the more I notice the door wasn’t where it used to be.

Last week, I marked its position on the floor with painter’s tape to signify a border I wouldn’t cross.

I checked last night, and the tape was gone, and the door had moved.

It had only moved just a few inches at first and it made me think that maybe I was imagining it.

After all, I was running on empty in terms of sleep.

But night after night, it kept inching closer.

It didn’t drag or creak—it just... shifted, like it wanted to be closer to me.

I measured the gap once — ten feet, then eight, then six. I stopped checking after that.

The space between me and it was shrinking, and I swear I could feel the heat of its breath on my face.

Sometimes, the floorboards sank a little beneath it, like it was pressing down with weight.

Whatever was behind it was coming for me.

This discovery led to another rule appearing:

14. No matter how close the door gets to you, do not touch it.

I didn’t plan on it.

I was too tired to plan anything anymore — just existing felt like a strategy in itself.

Last night, I swear I saw something move beneath the wood, like a hand pressing out.

I think my Grandpa’s sixty years only bought us time, and now, that time is almost gone.

He kept whatever this thing is locked away for decades and now it’s my turn.

One day, it will become somebody else’s.

I don’t want them to suffer like I and the men in my family before me have.

My hands won’t stop trembling.

I haven’t slept in days.

I’ve started hallucinating—at least, I hope they’re hallucinations.

I swear I saw the attic walls breathing last night.

I wonder if the door is even real.

Maybe I’ve lost my mind—trapped in a psych ward, mumbling while unseen eyes watch through glass.

I can hear them all.

My parents, Grandpa, myself.

They all speak from behind the door and the longer I listen, the more their words sound like truth.

A new rule appeared, carved directly into the attic floor, just in front of where I sit:

15. When your eyes close for the last time, the door will open from the inside.

I don’t know if I’m protecting the world from what’s behind the door or if I’m looking after it so it can’t escape before it’s ready.

Maybe that’s what Grandpa meant when he said he failed — not that he lost… but that he finally understood what he was guarding.

And yet, he kept watching.

So now I do too.

There’s one rule Grandpa never wrote.

If the door ever stops whispering… it means it’s already won.

My parents call to me now.

And now—

Another rule:

16. You will forget which side of the door you’re on.

If Grandpa could still see me now, I hope he knows I tried.

It didn’t sound threatening, in fact, it had a gentle tone that only made it all that more disturbing.

I remember walking up to the door and standing in front of it, my pulse erratic as my body shivered slightly.

A part of me wanted to open the door and put a name to the voice, but I remembered my Grandpa’s note.

“Do not be afraid.” It said it again, softer this time.

I followed the third rule: listen without answering.

So, I stood there, shaking, listening to that voice.

As the hours dragged on, I kept thinking about how my Grandpa sat in the attic every night.

Did he deal with the same things I’m dealing with?

How did he deal with listening to the voice?

Asking myself questions is how I would pass the time watching the door in the dark. 

It kept my mind sharp during the monotonous ritual of watching the door from sundown to sunrise.

That’s what it was like for about a week. 

Routine had almost made the horror feel ordinary, and that’s when it decided to change the rules.

Right before I went upstairs one night, I saw it—another line on my Grandpa’s note that hadn’t been there before.

In frantic handwriting it said:

6. If it cries, ignore it.

From then on, each night only got worse.

The crying started around 1 a.m.

It was the kind of crying a wounded animal made.

I wanted to help, anything to make the cries stop. 

I almost whispered, “Are you okay?”

But the rule was clear.

Ignore it.

So I did. 

In response, the floorboards near the door had darkened, and the air around it shimmered like heat off asphalt.

Whatever was behind that door, it wasn’t just growing stronger—it was changing the world around it.

I could feel it noticing me more each night.

And then, as if sensing my fear, the rules changed again.

A couple of weeks later, just before I made my way upstairs, I noticed some new lines had been written on the note.

7. It will show you things. Do not believe them.

8. It will tell you the future, but it’s all a lie.

The ink looked fresh this time, like someone — or something — had written them just moments before I came upstairs.

They didn’t make sense to me—not until the door made me understand.

It didn’t scream or cry like it had before. 

Instead, it spoke calmly about the things that awaited me in the future. 

“You’re going to become head of your department Nathan. You’ll fall in love and have three children, Elise, Michael, and Jonah.” 

The names echoed in my head like they belonged there all along.

“Elise will have your eyes. Jonah will want to be a pharmacist, like his grandmother.”

My eyes burned as tears threatened to fall.
 
“They’ll all live long, happy lives... unless you keep me in here.”

For a second, my body actually moved—I felt my weight shift forward, like some part of me had already made the decision. 

I pictured my future the way it described: warm, bright, full of laughter.

I wanted it. 

God, I wanted it so badly, but I saw through the threat masquerading as hope.

I remembered my Grandpa's handwriting again, warning me of the consequences, and forced myself to step back.

What had once been calm and persuasive—telling me things about myself, about the future, about promises too good to be true—became violent, almost desperate. 

With each sob and scream, the door groaned in a sickening rhythm, barely containing whatever was battering against it.

I covered my ears, begging for the noise to stop and after a few minutes, it did.

For a moment, I thought I had earned silence. 

But silence, I learned, was just the calm before something worse.

The door’s cracks began widening, twisting upward with sick crunches, the wood shifting to form the shapes of lips—dozens of them.

They were murmuring the story of a peaceful life waiting for me—if only I would open the door.

Its words filled the darkness, and shadows moved all around in shapes I recognized.

My Grandpa appeared next to me, but not the one I saw in the casket in the funeral, but the youthful one from old photographs.

“Grandson…” he whispered in a voice that almost sounded like his.

I didn’t speak; I couldn’t, even though I wanted to very badly.

My dad waved at me and told me how proud he was of me. 

My mom smiled and beckoned for me to open the door so we could be reunited as a family.

I leaned in front of the door, my hand on the knob about to turn it…when I saw something blink in the keyhole. 

It was an eye—black and moist, sliding sideways watching me, refusing to blink.

I stumbled back, and the whispers stopped.

The silence felt heavier than the noise.

But even in the stillness, something was shifting.

I used the flashlight on my phone to keep myself from nodding off in the early hours of the morning. 

Sometime around 2:30 AM, I noticed the shadows started to pulse against the light. 

Every few seconds, the door’s wine-dark surface would brighten from the inside out, glowing faintly, like there was something behind it pressing its face right against the wood.

That image alone was enough to make me sit in the darkness the rest of the night until the sun signaled it was morning.

Every night I felt myself unravel a little more.

My thoughts weren’t just mine anymore—they had a different voice. 

The door wasn’t just trying to break through—it was trying to break in, as if wanting to listen closer to what I have to say. 

Maybe that’s why the rules kept getting more difficult each night—it knew my thoughts before I did.

Before I went upstairs one time, I found two new rules written in the steam on the bathroom mirror.

They read:

9. It will try to bargain. Do not accept.

10. Do not believe the sounds you will hear. It will do anything to make you leave your post. 

I thought I understood the rules …until the early hours of the morning, when it didn’t knock, but begged profusely.

“Nathan…let me out. Please, just once. I can make it stop.”

But I wasn’t hearing just the voice of the door, I was hearing screams of my parents.

They were as gut-wrenching as they were familiar and I heard them coming from downstairs, then outside, then under the floorboards. 

A moment later, I smelled smoke.

It was faint at first, but the smell of burnt wood and melting plastic filled the air. 

I nearly bolted downstairs, my body ready to run and save them, but then I remembered the rule telling me not to believe the sounds I’m hearing.

The door was toying with me by digging into the deepest trauma it could find. 

I clenched my fists and stared at the door unmoving.

It spoke in my mom’s voice, then my dad’s, then Grandpa’s—sometimes weaving all three into one seamless, haunting sentence.

Then, it spoke in my voice, in the same tremble I’ve heard in myself every night since I moved in.

“Please…let me out…let me out….I just want out…”

Frozen in place, I endured its begging for hours.

My body screamed for a break, even just the relief of closing my eyes.

I was losing focus fast, the kind of fatigue that makes your eyes twitch just to stay open. 

I had to do something.

A desperate plan surfaced — a way to trick it, maybe.

Hoping to cheat the rules, I angled a mirror across from me — one eye could rest while the other kept watch.

For a time, it worked.

Until the reflection shifted.

In the mirror, the door stood wide open.

Something slithered out on all fours — gray-skinned and scaly, bones cracking with each movement.

Its head tilted toward me, not in curiosity, but in mimicry — like it was practicing being human.

I snapped my eyes to the real door —the real door was still shut tight, breathing.

When I looked back, the mirror was empty—except for five wet fingerprints smeared downward, like someone had leaned against it from the inside.

I sat there for a long time after that. 

The lantern burned out, but I couldn’t bring myself to light another one.

I kept thinking about my Grandpa, standing in this same spot for sixty years, his eyes fixed on the same door, watching it breathe, whisper, and beg.

Did he ever think about just walking away?

I think about leaving every night. 

I think about the stairs behind me, about sunlight, about sleep.

But then I remember what my Grandpa asked of me.

My responsibility is what keeps me here, and the fear of what happens if I stop watching.

When morning came, I didn’t remember falling asleep. 

I only remembered the mirror, and the way those fingerprints stained it.

To drown out the noise, I fixated on one impossible question: how did Grandpa carry this burden for decades?

The more I thought about it, the more I feared the real answer: maybe he didn’t.

For a while, nothing really changed outside of my routine, the knocking, and the voices pleading behind the door.

That is until some more rules appeared on the page.

11. A single moment of inattention is all it needs. Do not falter.

12. Do not fall asleep in front of the door.

At this point, I was delirious and running on fumes.

I could barely stay awake at work, and I was averaging maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night.

There’s only so much coffee and energy drinks can do for your body before it stops working as effectively.

There was one instant where my eyes almost fluttered shut—and I swear I felt something brush against my cheek. 

The knocking started again—but it wasn’t coming from the door anymore, it was coming from behind me. 

I spun around, nearly tripping over the lantern. 

Then the walls, the window, and even the ceiling above me all echoed with that knocking sound.

The door would shake, the voices would scream, I’d see my loved ones begging for me to open the door, but I wouldn’t.

The voice behind the door would speak things to me like:

“Do not be afraid. Open the door Nathan and I will make all of this stop.”

I ignored it.

At around 3 a.m., my phone started ringing across the floorboards. 

The screen said:

GRANDPA.

Seeing his smiling face on the screen shattered something in me—because I knew he was dead.

Despite the feeling in my gut telling me not to, I answered. 

Nothing about the rules said that I couldn’t take a phone call.

“Nathan,“ His voice crackled through the phone speaker.

“You’ve done enough, my boy. Let me take your place. Go downstairs and rest now.”

My thumb hovered over the screen, my heart thudding as I remembered the other voices, the lies.

I ended the call.

The phone rang nonstop until sunrise.

Hours later, a new rule appeared—one that nearly broke me.

In slanted, sloppy letters was the worst one I had seen yet:

13. Eventually, you will fail. Fight it off for as long as you can.

I read that line over and over until the ink blurred.

The words didn’t feel like a warning anymore — they felt like a countdown.

Not just because of what it said — but because of what it didn’t.

Maybe this is what Grandpa meant…

Maybe failure isn’t about opening the door—it’s about how long you can last before you want to.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. 

The last few nights, l’ve been hearing slow, deliberate footsteps behind the door, and the floorboards creaking in time with my own heartbeat.

I keep telling myself none of it’s real, that I’m still the one in control.

But the longer I watch, the more I notice the door wasn’t where it used to be.

Last week, I marked its position on the floor with painter’s tape to signify a border I wouldn’t cross. 

I checked last night, and the tape was gone, and the door had moved. 

It had only moved just a few inches at first and it made me think that maybe I was imagining it. 

After all, I was running on empty in terms of sleep.

But night after night, it kept inching closer. 

It didn’t drag or creak—it just... shifted, like it wanted to be closer to me. 

I measured the gap once — ten feet, then eight, then six. I stopped checking after that.

The space between me and it was shrinking, and I swear I could feel the heat of its breath on my face. 

Sometimes, the floorboards sank a little beneath it, like it was pressing down with weight. 

Whatever was behind it was coming for me.

This discovery led to another rule appearing:

14. No matter how close the door gets to you, do not touch it.

I didn’t plan on it.

I was too tired to plan anything anymore — just existing felt like a strategy in itself.

Last night, I swear I saw something move beneath the wood, like a hand pressing out.

I think my Grandpa’s sixty years only bought us time, and now, that time is almost gone.

He kept whatever this thing is locked away for decades and now it’s my turn. 

One day, it will become somebody else’s.

I don’t want them to suffer like I and the men in my family before me have.

My hands won’t stop trembling. 

I haven’t slept in days. 

I’ve started hallucinating—at least, I hope they’re hallucinations. 

I swear I saw the attic walls breathing last night.

I wonder if the door is even real.

Maybe I’ve lost my mind—trapped in a psych ward, mumbling while unseen eyes watch through glass.

I can hear them all. 

My parents, Grandpa, myself. 

They all speak from behind the door and the longer I listen, the more their words sound like truth.

A new rule appeared, carved directly into the attic floor, just in front of where I sit:

15. When your eyes close for the last time, the door will open from the inside.

I don’t know if I’m protecting the world from what’s behind the door or if I’m looking after it so it can’t escape before it’s ready.

Maybe that’s what Grandpa meant when he said he failed — not that he lost… but that he finally understood what he was guarding.

And yet, he kept watching.

So now I do too.

There’s one rule Grandpa never wrote.

If the door ever stops whispering… it means it’s already won.

My parents call to me now.

And now—

Another rule:

16. You will forget which side of the door you’re on.

If Grandpa could still see me now, I hope he knows I tried.

I used to run the 4 rears for a square setup, but after [my crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Corvette/comments/qyyf0n/ive_had_better_days_at_the_track/) a few years ago I upgraded to a full set of [TrackSpec wheels.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Corvette/comments/v9z1hl/got_some_better_pics_of_the_rebuilt_car_this/)  Ever since then, all 6 OEM wheels have been sitting in the corner of the shop.

Two of the wheels were damaged in the crash.  They are still round and hold air, but they are bent at the hub and have some runout.  I've been told by several wheel repair shops that they're not repairable.  I think I'm going to try to sell them on ebay, but I have no idea what they're even worth.  I'll probably list them for super cheap and see what happens.  The problem is that they will likely cost $50/ea to ship, and I'm not even sure they're worth that just to make a coffee table or something.

That leaves the 4 good wheels.  They're in good condition, but I really have no use for them.  With two sets of TrackSpec wheels, I don't see any situation where I'd ever end up mounting them.  If I ever sell the car (unlikely, I'll probably just run it until I kill it for good) it would be sold with the TrackSpec wheels.  

Is there any reason to hang on to the set of OEM wheels?  It looks like I could get a thousand dollars or more based on what they seem to be selling for on ebay.  I'm just hesitant to let them go since they're original to the car.  

NOTE:  Per Rule 1, this is not a ""for sale"" thread.  I am asking for opinions on keeping the wheels, not offers to buy them.  If I do choose to sell them, they will be listed for sale on ebay and maybe CorvetteForum",1,1760537215.0,Corvette,0,1.0,False

Cold War nuclear horror meets archanotech.  Hubris meets entropy and is found...wanting.

# Now I am become...Bored

The alarms had been screaming for fifteen minutes when she entered the cleanroom.  Fifteen whole minutes.  Had he the wherewithal to examine that particular datum, Doctor Kellvan Thrace might have thrown up his hands in frustration.  His team had only been securing their work for the last five...no one believed what was happening until it was upon them.

Now, they stood huddled together in the far corner of the formerly sterile room as pulsating warning lights painted the formerly white walls in bloody red.  A half dozen of the greatest scientific, arcane, and alchemical minds in the Northern Defense Alliance cowered in the corner and watched a small woman hold their great work in her hand and examine it like so much produce at the market.

Dr. Thrace had watched the scrying monitor over his morning coffee when she'd first appeared from the foggy dew that clung to the base of Mount Karadesh.  Nestled deep in the Ashscar range, their hidden fortress—known only as ""Area 7"" on official maps—divination glyphs scattered for a hundred miles along every approach.  Apparently no one had told their visitor this fact, so she had simply declined to participate until the sentries saw her her walking up.  Slight of build, but eerily pale as the mist from where she emerged.  Hair the color of ash fell in flat curtains to her neck, and skin like white marble shot through with softly glowing blue veins suffused the morning fog with a dim, otherworldly glow in the mountain's shadowed dawn light.  A white dress trailed behind her like it had condensed upon her in deference to her audience's sense of propriety and her bare feet padded silently up the dirt path toward Area 7.

The initial alert had draw only morbid interest.  They occasionally received visitors who were too lost or too stupid to know better and those visitors sometimes gave the observers a bit of entertainment when they believed they could force their way into one of the most secure sites on the continent.

She'd ignored the first sentry's shouted command and from deep within the facility watching eyes leaned in for the show.  They certainly received one.  When he approached her with his rifle to shove her away, she'd broken his arm without breaking her stride.

Base defenses sprang to life in an instant.  A dozen enchanted, repeating rifles trained on her at center mass and held.  Shouts of warning, commands from sergeants, alert klaxons all rang out to shatter the quiet morning.  She placidly continued her stroll forward.  Anti-vehicle emplacements were the first to fall.  She walked up to the red-and-white painted barrier gate and it fell apart at her touch.  The arm swung violently upward when half of its length rusted away and its counterweight took over.  Dragon's Teeth—pyramidal monoliths of reinforced concrete meant to halt armored vehicles—eroded to sand as she walked through them rather than around them and the razor wire between them fell away in a red-tinted snow or powdery crystalline rust where it deigned to touch her.  The first rifles spat fire from their throats soon after.  She absorbed the projectiles without flinching, her dress rippled like water disturbed by carelessly-tossed pebbles.  Holes in her alabaster flesh closed behind the passing bullets as fast as they were created.

One scrying sensor captured a close-up view when one particularly brave Private rushed the intruder.  He aimed his rifle at her temple and pulled the trigger.  Her head snapped sideways and her step finally faltered.  Everyone held their breaths, even Dr. Thrace in the command suite.  Then she moved.

The ghostly woman reached up like she was adjusting her hair, set her skull back in place on her neck, and patted the broken shards of bone back into place over the entrance wound over her eye.  She turned to the Private and stepped slowly near as he quavered in disbelief.  She smoothly reached toward his helmet, plucked a piece of gray flesh from it, and pressed it back into place in her hairline.  She fixed the young man with a glare that, even in the scrying monitor, resembled a governess dealing with a particularly troublesome child.  She held one small hand up to her mouth and spit the deformed bullet into it.  Had the monitor not been able to convey her words, Kellvan would have never believed the Private's account.

""That was brave, but quite rude.  If you do it again,"" she placed the bullet in his shirt pocket, ""I shall be \*very\* cross with you.""

Kellvan dropped his coffee and slammed a hand down on the emergency alert crystal before the watch commander could gather his thoughts.

That was fifteen minutes ago.  Most mornings it took Dr. Thrace thirty minutes to navigate the facility he knew by heart—checkpoints and clearance procedures included—to reach his workplace in the Sealed Sanctum.  She had invaded the cleanroom in half that time.  Three twenty-ton blast doors had been breached.  Despite being designed to withstand anything short of direct airship bombardment, each was reduced to dust at the touch of her palm.  Disintegration glyphs had fizzled at her approach, tanglefoot traps left as rotting plant matter, and adamantine nets reduced to nothing but glittery, tinkling sand on the floor.

After fifteen minutes of panic, including ten minutes of explaining over and over again that this was ""not a godsdamned drill"" to everyone he passed, he cowered with his colleagues in the corner of the Sanctum.  The impossible woman gazed at the metal sphere in her hand with the expression of someone who was thoroughly and completely done with being disappointed in new and utterly stupid ways.  She turned the shiny metal sphere over in the red light and examined it with a jeweler's eye.  About the size of an apple but much, much heavier; the object turned and moved in her graceful grip like a rhythmic gymnast's prop.  Each movement made Dr. Thrace's heart skip.  This particular core had already claimed two researchers' lives in separate incidents—hubris had met indifferent engineering and been found wanting.  Their deaths had been agonizing and he'd attended to each.

The thought of joining them made his bowels loosen.  His torment was interrupted when she finally uttered her first syllable toward the room in general.

""Tsk.""

Her posture relaxed and her shoulders dropped in what appeared to be sadness.  ""It's so...simple.  You've spent your energy to make suffering mundane.""  She turned to them and her milky blind eyes bored straight through Kellvan, seemingly able to spot the leader of the group with instant recognition.  ""I suppose you're proud of this...\*thing\*?""  She held out the sphere and everyone in the room flinched.

Proud?  Yes, they were proud.  The Final Dawn Project had cost their nation millions of pounds of gold, nearly brought them to war with the Kryn over mining rights, had claimed hundreds of lives to accidents and overreach.  That fourteen-pound, perfectly machined sphere was worth more than the mountain that housed it.  

She bounced it in her palm like a child's amusement and sneered at them.

""You think you've made the last great weapon, don't you?  The bomb to end all bombs.""  She scoffed and shook her head.  ""Well, you haven't, and it's not.  I know where your path leads.  You think that detonating this-this \*abomination\* will put a stop to war?  Idiots.  It will be the starter pistol for the next race.""

""Lady, you need to put the device back \*NOW\*!""  Reinforcements had arrived in the doorway behind their intruder.  Men in fatigues took cover in the rusted remains of the chamber's entrance.  Each held an enchanted rifle loaded with alchemical rounds worth more than their yearly salaries.  Kellvan recognized Captain Duran, the commander of Area 7's security forces.  The otherworldly visitor rolled her milky eyes.

""I warned you,"" she mumbled and flicked her free hand backward like she was swatting at a mosquito.  Captain Duran's rifle began actively disintegrating in his hands; blued steel flaked away in rivulets of red and black and polymer grips cracked and fell apart.  Before he could reflexively throw the broken tool away, the degradation reached its chambered round.  Its propellant rapidly changed from a stable admixture to an unstable cocktail and detonated.  Instead of a controlled deflagration that would propel a bullet down a precisely engineered barrel, the explosion lodged a wad of degraded metal into a tube of degraded metal and tore the rest of the rifle apart in its anger.  The Captain stumbled backward, screaming and cradling his mangled hand.  His men pulled him out of the room and toward waiting medical intervention.

Kellvan's mouth went dry. His heart hammered against his ribs with a rhythm that felt like panic given percussion. Around him, his colleagues were frozen—Dr. Sharenne had tears running down her face, Professor Valenis was muttering prayers to the Changebringer under his breath, and old Dr. Morrick looked like he might simply expire from terror.  Even the imposing figure of Dr. Caldris seemed to be contracting in the manner of someone who was desperately trying to phase through the wall at his back.

Dr. Sharenne found her voice, choked as it was.  ""What \*are\* you!?""  She clapped her hands over her mouth in fear and sucked in air through the paper mask that had once been meant to preserve the room's bygone integrity.  The intruder appeared to pause in her task for the first time since her dramatic entrance.  She cocked her head, an oddly birdlike gesture, and considered both the question and questioner.

""I..."" she began and gathered her thoughts, ""I was a girl.""  An oddly wistful expression crossed her face.  ""I spoke with flowers.  I fought bullies.  I danced.  I—""  She paused again and a genuine smile pulled at her mouth.  ""I fell in love...once.  She was so sharp, so \*alive\*.  She saw everything I was and everything I could be...""  For just a moment, the preternatural intruder looked for all the world like just what she described—a young woman in love.  The smile faded and she returned to the present with a hard glare.  ""But others—others like you—they poured their righteousness into me, made me something awful.  They too believed that if they could only make a weapon big enough then surely goodness would prevail.  They never understood...the glorious dead are simply dead.  They care not why they fell.""

The room fell suffocatingly silent despite the ongoing alarms.  Her layered rebuke settled upon everyone there like a heavy blanket.

To her credit, Dr. Sharenne summoned her courage and reached out to the interloper.  Her gloved hand shook but she searched the milk-glass clouded eyes for connection.

""You-you don't have to be what they made you.  You can choose to—""  The woman's short, sharp scoff broke the spell and the young researcher recoiled back to the huddle.

""Oh, dear one, no.""  She shook her head.  ""I am not their weapon.  When they set me on the path that you now walk, I beheld that there was no end to it.  So I became something much, much worse than their weapon.  I became the end.  Such was the price of their conceit.""  She raised the sphere into their eye line again.  ""This is the price of yours.  Everything tends toward dissolution, but \*this\*?  I can feel the malevolence inside it.  It \*wants\* to destroy itself.  It aches for oblivion and would take everything it can touch with it given the chance.  You have created something that should not exist.  It is a wound in the world.""  She blinked at the orb and considered its shiny surface once more.  She turned to Dr. Thrace.  ""What did you call it this time?""

The aged scientist's throat closed and he smacked his lips in an attempt to speak clearly.  Lying to this being was beyond folly and he was no fool.

""Ravenium,"" he cleared his throat.  ""Ravenium-239.  After the goddess of—""

""\*Ravenium\*?""  She interrupted him and spat the word out like it tasted of rancid meat.  ""If we had a geologic age I could not explain how...how...\*gauche\* that is.  The Duskmaven would find it it utterly absurd.""  She palmed the deadly sphere and pointed an accusatory finger at him.  ""You are very, very lucky that she cannot act out of spite.""  Her expression changed just then.  It didn't exactly soften, more like it sharpened.  ""I, on the other hand, labor under no such constraints.""  She cooled further and raised the core to her lips.

""Well now, abomination, it is time I grant your wish.  In part, at least.""  She raised her eyes from the object to stare daggers at the scientists beyond it.  ""Tell me, o learned architects of damnation...what might become of your little curiosity if I were to encourage entropy within it?""

Kellvan's eyes went wide as saucers.  He gawked and stuttered as his mind ran through the calculations.  The flux density formulae, the careful geometries, the safeguards and cut corners alike.  It took the chattering of detection equipment to his left for him to realize that her question was rhetorical.  Each of the scientists looked at each other in horror when the all experienced the same sensations: tingling static in their hair and the phantom taste of metal on their tongues.

""You should already be running away.""  The intruder spoke darkly and with a hint of confusion in her voice, as though she wasn't sure if she was remembering mortal fear response correctly.  She stepped aside in an oddly graceful and courtly manner; a hostess bidding her guests farewell.  ""Go.""

They were frozen in horror for half a heartbeat when a new alarm began screaming.  This was no warning klaxon, it was the last enchantment the mountain would ever need, the last sound any of them ever wished to hear.  In ear-splitting decibels, it wailed directly at their basest instincts: \*Criticality Event, Run or Die\*

They ran.

As the panicked stampede rushed for the door, Dr. Caldris stopped short.  The largest man in the room skidded to a halt beside the intruder when her delicate, porcelain hand shot out and gripped his arm.  He pulled, primitive fear imbuing him with even greater strength.  She did not budge, ageless ennui giving her strength that surpassed his.

""Not you,"" she said.  ""You will stay and watch what you have begotten.""

""Please!  I have a family!"" he shrieked over the alarms.  A few of his colleagues faltered in their flight but their survival instincts kept them in motion.

""You do not.""

""This is murder!""  He pulled again.

""This is a worksite closure.""  She dryly observed.  His eyes darted from the sphere to the door and he met the apologetic gaze of Professor Valenis as the fleeing man abandoned his colleague to his fate.

""Don't let her do this!""  The large man pitifully cried out and reached for the retreating white coats.

""Stop it.""  The woman shook his arm.  ""You're embarrassing yourself.""

Alone with her in the dying room, he dropped his hand and the panic in his eyes melted away as if it had never been there.  Because it hadn't been.

""Terribly theatrical, \*Vorshadak\*,"" he quipped as if judging her performance.  She sighed in response.

""If you think that was theatrical, you would have hated me when I was mortal.""

""Oh I'm sure of it.""  He turned in her grip, which was still as implacable as cold-forged steel.  ""You could have let me go.  They'll tell your tale as one of coldblooded murder now.""  He smiled and his teeth looked a little too sharp.  She shrugged.

""They've told it wrong before.  They'll tell it wrong again.""  She finally deigned to look up at him and took in his chiseled features, perfectly swept hair, and self-assured grin.  ""Take off that stupid suit.  You look like a himbo scientist without the good-natured personality.""

His smile wavered and he rolled his eyes.  The glamour fell away like rain sloughing off waterfowl.  His white coat burned off like flash paper and was replaced by spiky, black iron armor.  His tanned complexion gave way to sickly grey skin and his teeth became too numerous and sharp.  A forked tongue snuck out and wet his thin, draw lips as his eyes went blank and pale as a corpse.

""You do know that we'll just keep working at our other sites, right?""  He mocked her.

""You will try,"" she said wearily, ""and you will fail.""  She pondered the orb in her hand as it grew steadily warmer.  Blue light peeked out from between her fingers—a warning sign to any who saw it that death was swiftly approaching.  ""So whose idea was it this time?  Belial or Fierna?  If they sent a narzugon they must've really thought this one would work.""

""Does it really matter?""  He asked, attempting to toy with her and forestall the inevitable.  She idly shook her head and rolled the apocalypse pebble in her hand.

""To me personally?  No.  I was just curious as to whom you will be begging for forgiveness.  Give them my regards and if you feel daring, let them know that I remain..."" her milky gaze left the sphere and settled on his face, ""unimpressed.""  With no outward sign of effort, she pushed the weapon in her hand to pulse.  A wave of invisible, searing light extended outward faster than the air could permit it, causing a flash of the same blue warning.  The fiend in her grasp tensed and wavered.  His kind were immune to many things that would hurt mortals, but not nuclear violence at a subatomic scale.

""Wait!"" he gasped.  ""Before you end me, you should know...I was one of the Sciatha who perished at Duskhollow.""  She raised one pale eyebrow at him and he leaned in to pick at the wound he sensed there.  ""Oh yes, because of you I fell on my own sword.  I remained there, a tormented spirit for over two \*hundred\* years before they came to me with an offer.  All I had to do was abandon the oath I had taken.  The oath that had given me nothing but suffering in return!""

The implacable woman regarded him for a moment and tilted her head in a gesture that looked at once deeply empathetic and caustically sarcastic.

""Oh my.  This must all feel excruciatingly ironic to you then.""  The sphere pulsed in her grip again, quickly growing red with heat, then through orange to blue to white-hot.  The fiend tried to take a breath and scream but inhaled only light.  The air around him forgot that it was supposed to be air and flew apart to become just more microscopic shrapnel that minced his material form from the inside out.

The woman released his arm when he collapsed, his body rapidly liquifying under the orb's onslaught.  She turned her attention to the miniature sun in her palm.  She did not wince, the cascade of burning energy and invisible particles washed over her like a summer rain.  Entropic destruction flew out at the speed of light in all directions, found the matter within her to be a peer, and continued cordially on its way.  She gently hushed it.

""Shhh...there now.  Let it all out.  Your suffering is almost over.""  While her hands tenderly cradled the would-be doomsday device, her consciousness worked within it.  She balanced the crystalline lattice of metal on a razor's edge of violent syncopation; fast enough to burn it all away but slow enough to keep it from tearing both itself and the mountain around them to pieces.  The chittering devices and blaring alarms around her fell silent and the lights that had bathed the room in red were doused.  Electromagnetic waves that simultaneously screamed in all frequencies at once overloaded everything wrought by mortal minds.  Trillions of invisible bullets screamed across the void between atoms before encountering the random, unlucky mote of matter that would accept them.  They transmuted the very walls, floors, ceilings, furniture, and instruments into their own angrily activated cousins, who flung their rage outward in turn.  In the newfound darkness, everything around the woman began to emit the same eerie, blue glow.

Seconds became minutes, became an hour, and still she cradled the stillborn god-bomb and sang it to sleep.  Its white-hot fury finally guttered and failed, dropping quickly back to blue and yellow before settling on dull red.  The ravenium was gone.  Its daughter products and granddaughter products were gone.  All that remained was a warm and perfectly-machined lump of lead—the most common and alchemically boring material in the world.  She considered it one final time before gently placing it back in the shielded container from which she had taken it.  The erstwhile weapon was technically still a weapon...if only in the sense that one irritable primate could pick it up and bash in the skull of another, less fortunate primate—but nothing more.  She gently closed the lid with a quiet click and then, succumbing to her theatrical nature, angled the box slightly toward the rusted-out doorway.  She wanted to make sure that anyone foolish enough to venture down here millennia hence, when the induced radioactivity of the site died down, would be thoroughly confused as to why such an obviously secure facility was built around an inert lead ball.

She dusted her hands off and turned with a sigh.  ""And on to the next one..."" she said to no one.  ""We have to do this dance every godsdamned century and it's only getting worse.""  The impossible woman padded silently toward the door and stopped at the threshold.  The mountain was suffocatingly quiet now, nothing but her moved anymore.  The people had fled at the screeching of the criticality alarm.  Everything else lay still...the rodents in the walls, the lice on those rodents, the fungi in the damp corners...even the bacteria in the vents.  Nothing but death and the intruder remained.  And death finally made itself known.

In the darkened anteroom beyond, one corner seemed deeper than the darkness.  Lit only by the dying blue glow of activated concrete, this corner absorbed even that light.  It was ancient, but not malevolent.  Neutral, but not uncaring.  The woman turned to face it, respectfully.

""I know that you are beyond taking offense,"" she whispered to what lay within.  ""But while my mind is my own, I take offense on your behalf.""

From deep within the pitch-black shroud, a smooth mask of white became barely visible to her eyes—eyes which saw beyond the world that had clouded them.  The pair stood in silence for a time.

The mask nodded.

She nodded back and walked out.

Ten miles from Mount Karadesh and five hours after the evacuation of Area 7, Dr. Thrace sat with his surviving cohort.  Each of them was wrapped in a silvery thermal blanket in the antechamber of the decontamination shower tent as healers and diagnosticians hovered around them like concerned flys.  Initial estimates looked promising—they should all survive the doses they'd absorbed.  Some would likely be suffering for an unpleasant few weeks first though.

A man in fresh fatigues stood among them and consulted his notebook.  The lack of ornamentation on his uniform paradoxically screamed his status as military intelligence to anyone who thought to look.  He'd introduced himself ""Brevet-Colonel Anderts"" but Kellvan doubted any of those words were true.

""Did she give any clue as to who sent her?""  The man asked.  He'd posed the same question in three different ways over the last twenty minutes and the weary scientist's answer was the same each time.

""Nothing.  She wasn't sent.""

""What about her accent?  Did she sound Imperial?  You mentioned it was somewhat lyrical, Imperial spies educated in the west and trained in our borders typically soften their consonants.""

Dr. Thrace shook his head in frustration.  They'd stared into the face of annihilation and annihilation had blinked, had allowed them to live.  Kellvan knew in his irradiated bones that, like the sphere he had so foolishly created, he should not exist anymore.

And this buffoon was looking for an excuse to continue the hostility by blaming their enemies.

""She wasn't Imperial!"" he shouted up at the officer.  ""She was..."" his voice wavered, ""she was a consequence.  She was the rising of the moon at the end of the day, the high tide after the low.  She could have killed us all.  She could have detonated that core the \*moment\* she laid eyes on it.""  He shook his head and stared at the floor.  ""We're alive because she's not our enemy.""

The debriefer scoffed.  ""She set us back twenty years, at least!  There is more value locked away in that irradiated mountain than most countries' coffers!  If that's not an enemy, then what is it?""

Doctor Morrick, the eldest of the survivors, cleared his throat.  He pulled his silvery thermal blanket tighter and looked the younger man in the eye.

""The Ash Queen.  She was the Ash Queen.""  The room went quiet and Anderts scribbled a note.

""Is that some sort of insurgent leader?""  He asked, grasping at meaning.  The old scientist shook his head wearily.

""It's a story my grandmother used to tell.  I'd forgotten about it until I heard it again as an undergraduate.  I barely paid attention to that class...comparative anthropology.  We studied some old works—a collection of stories that all suggested a woman who has outlived even dragons.""

""Raghthul.""  Doctor Sharenne spoke up, her teeth chattering.  ""You read the work of Beric Raghthul.  I remember it too.""

""Yes, yes, fascinating stuff.""  Anderts angrily annotated his most recent entry with his opinion on the academics' characters.  ""We don't have time to run down every ancient story while our enemies—""

""She was the Ash Queen!""  Morrick shouted, inducing a wracking cough in the old man's chest.  He recovered himself and looked up accusingly.  ""Go, read the stories yourself.  You'll see they match everything we've told you.""

Brevet-Colonel Anderts forcefully closed his notebook.  He turned on one polished boot heel and stalked out of the tent; mumbling about mass delusions and ivory-tower brains being addled by radiation.

In the quiet that remained, only the crinkling of thermal blankets interrupted the survivors' thoughts.  Dr. Morrick finally gave voice to what they were all pondering.

""Why did she let us leave?  If she wanted to destroy the device, why let us live with the knowledge of how to reconstruct it?""

""Wisdom.""  Dr. Thrace muttered.  ""Without our knowledge of \*why\* she did this, the story just becomes abstract warning...like the Ash Queen stories.""  He shrugged and his shoulders slumped.  ""Easy to forget.  Easy to ignore so they can just try again.  She wants us to remember...to make them remember.""

By sunset the first load of concrete was poured into the gaping wound that had been the rusted-out blast door of Area 7.  Unknown to the radiation-suited work crews, a pale woman walked through the dark wilderness on the far side of the mountain.  Each silent, implacable step brought her closer to the next laboratory, the next mountain, the next abomination.

She would nullify that one too.  Just as she had before, just as she would continue to do.

Every test food went OK, I had a lot of gas but not the chronic diarrhoea which was my main concern, and when I was away (eating pretty much anything), the diarrhoea didn’t return either.

Prior to the diet, I was drinking coffee every day, but switched to decaf when I started low fodmap. 
Could that alone have been causing such severe symptoms, and the reason my symptoms improved, but I didn’t react individually to the test foods, is because it was the caffiene? I know caffeine is a gut irritant, but I was frequently going to the toilet 7-8 times a day, very loose stools / diarrhoea, pain and nausea etc. I drank coffee every day though, so if so, why some days would I be fine, and others have awful flare ups?

Now I’ve returned home, I don’t know whether to go back on the diet to test the final two groups (even though my symptoms off the diet have been relatively controlled other than when I was coming on my period), or whether I can just attribute the symptoms to the coffee? 
It seems crazy to have gone through the whole diet unnecessarily when I could have just stopped drinking coffee! ",1,1760537112.0,FODMAPS,1,1.0,False

Mas não, é ler textos de dialogos de personagens que eu não consigo me importar nenhum pouco.

Não estou comparando, é que o exercício da leitura é mentalmente desgastante — eu trato realmente como exercício mental diário, igual academia —, não como valeria apena gastar minhas energias com isso.

That was my breaking point,"I was cleaning out my kitchen this weekend and realized I had forty seven coffee mugs. Forty seven. I live alone. I drink maybe two cups of coffee a day. I don’t even know where half of them came from maybe gifts, trips, random promotions, probably a few from exes. That number was my wake up call. I kept four that I actually love and use and the rest are gone. And that one decision kind of started something. Now I’m going through everything like clothes, books, cables random “just in case” junk and asking myself the same question: do I use it regularly or do I truly love it? If not it goes. It’s wild how much lighter everything feels already. Last night I was playing wow on my deskop and glanced at my desk no clutter, no piles of stuff and it genuinely calmed me down. I didn’t realize how much mental noise all that physical clutter was creating.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1760536705.0,JehovahsWitnesses,1,1.0,False

1o7boua,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o7boua/how_a_borderline_made_me_believe_in_love_chaos/,"How a borderline made me believe in love, chaos, and psychiatric medication","Alright, picture this:
I’m 19 or 20, emotionally built like a wet croissant, freshly out of a toxic relationship but still kinda tangled up with my ex.
Working at a bakery. Selling dreams, living nightmares.

One day this new girl walks in.
Weird. Beautiful. Looks like she listens to Lana Del Rey while disassociating in the shower.
She’s reading At the Mountains of Madness.
So obviously, me being a socially anxious anime nerd with savior-complex tendencies, I go:

“Have you read Uzumaki by Junji Ito?”
Because trauma recognizes trauma.



We start talking, flirting, sharing smirks in the kitchen.
At some point, I tell her the truth:

“Hey, I’m still kinda dealing with my ex, not ready for anything serious.”
Translation: “I’m about to ruin my life.”



She stays.
I stay.
It feels good to be wanted. Like a stray cat someone feeds once and now you think you have a home.

Weeks pass.
Somewhere between the overtimes and existential rants, I fall in love.
Not movie love. More like “she’s emotionally unstable but makes good coffee” love.

I introduce her to my mom (mistake #1).
Everything’s sweet. Life’s good. I’m out here thinking this woman’s gonna be the mother of my kids.
Then one day, I check her phone.
Random dude.
Nudes.
Of course.

She cries, says she thought we “weren’t that serious.”
And me, with the emotional IQ of a goldfish, go:

“Maybe I didn’t make it clear enough 🥲.”
Forgave her. Because why heal when you can collect red flags like Pokémon cards?



We break up. We get back together.
Everything feels perfect again.
She understands my weird philosophical breakdowns. I adore the way she cooks while listening to Arctic Monkeys like she’s in a tragic indie film.

Then my mom moves away.
(She left for a woman. Yeah, Freud’s ghost is screaming right now.)
I tell my girlfriend she can move in. She does.
Month one: love and noodles.
Month two: perfume, coworkers, “don’t wait up for me.”
And me? Internal Windows error noise.

One night we fight about pizza (because apparently that’s my villain origin story).
I lock myself in the bathroom and literally ask the universe for a sign.
5 AM. Her phone lights up.
The sign arrives.
She’s confessing her feelings… to her supervisor.

“I don’t wanna hurt anyone but I don’t know what to do 🥺.”
Girl, what you don’t know is how to log out.

Turns out they’d been seeing each other for months.
The day before, we were talking about kids.
The day after, she’s at the mall with her boss.
✨Balance in the universe.✨

So yeah. Therapy. Psychiatrist. Emotional patch notes 2.0.
Still no apology.
We hooked up a few times after (because hearts are stupid), but each time I felt emptier like an off-brand printer cartridge.

Now I’m doing better.
More mature, calm, kinda dead inside but in a peaceful way.
Sometimes I can’t tell where depression ends and independence begins maybe they’re the same thing.
I’m ten times stronger than I was back then.
But there are still nights when it’s hard to breathe…
and even harder not to think,

“What if I had done things differently?”

---

🧠 Moral of the story:
If a girl is reading Lovecraft at work, she’s not studying horror.
She is the horror.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

1o7bj46,https://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/1o7bj46/are_you_searching_for_purpose_of_life_here_that_is/,are you searching for purpose of life ? here that is -,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1760536187.0,OccultConspiracy,0,1.0,False

1o7bhhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1o7bhhn/creative_diversity_cheat_sheet_for_meta/,Creative Diversity Cheat Sheet for Meta Advertisers,"Creative diversity is the current 'hot topic' so I figured I would weigh in. In this post I am going to discuss what it is and how to easily vary up your creative to give the machine what it wants. I will also share some tips I've found along the way.

**What does creative diversity mean?**

Creative diversity basically means making ads that are very different from one another in terms of their message, media type, creative format and style.

According to Meta, their newest Andromeda algorithm update will lump ads together in the same auction (thus compete against each other) if they are perceived as too similar. To avoid this and scale your ad accounts, Meta recommends having diverse creatives. 

[(Link) ](https://ibb.co/bjxT0vN9)\- Here is an example from Meta which shows ads from less differentiated to more differentiated.

So next, what are the different things we can change to make our creatives diverse? 

**Message**

You can switch up the message in your ad to target different pockets of people. 

* **Personas / Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**
   * Generally there will be 1 or more ideal customers for you product or service. Speaking to them (and only them) is essential to having an ad that resonates with them. Speaking to different customer personas is a way to diversify your creatives.
   * *Example:* a roofing companies ICP may be residential home owners, but they may also service commercial clients which would have different needs, pain points, etc. Having ad 1 ad that speaks to residential and 1 that speaks to commercial would be considered diverse. 
* **Angle**
   * There are many reasons why people buy your products or services...but there are always 1-2 main reasons that are the most potent, most scalable and will drive the most sales. It is up to us as advertisers to find those and make them core to our messaging. Switching up the angle of the ad is a way to make your ads more diverse. 
   * ***Example:*** an eCommerce store selling fall boots may have identified the top 3 angles are 1) cozy boots you can wear all day 2) keeping your feet warm in the winter 3) stylish  boots that will get your endless compliments. Making some ads specifically around each angle will allow you to diversify your messaging and thus target buyers who are buying for a different reason.  
   * Within Angles, we can then vary up the *headlines* or *hooks* within a particular angle to find which headline grabs attention and selects the correct audience. 
   * ***Example:*** For angle 1) headlines could include: NEW Cozy Boots You Won't Want to Take Off or ""I Wore These All Day At Work And Forgot To Take Them When I Got Home""
   * Both of these headlines target the same angle but have different approaches.
* **Emotion**
   * They say that humans buy with emotion and justify with logic. If that is the case, we can try to vary up the emotional tone in the ads to elicit different emotional responses.
   * ***Example:*** I went to Home Depot looking for a fire / CO2 alarm...in the same isle I saw a Radon Detector that had a headline ""RADON IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF LUNG CANCER DEATHS IN AMERICA"" this immediately gave me a fear response and made me want to protect my family from this. So I bought it.
   * Instead of focusing on fear, they could have focused on relief and peace of mind with this headline ""Finally, a simple way to know your home is safe from radon."" 
   * Different emotion, different buyer. I believe they 'sell the scare' because it is much more effective, but I digress.
* **Awareness / Sophistication**
   * Markets are always changing through various levels of awareness and sophistication. Tailoring your message to different levels of awareness and sophistication allow you to diversify your creative. To learn more about this, read Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene M. Schwartz. 
   * ***Example:*** to keep on the Radon example. A large part of America may not know anything about Radon (I didn't) therefore the problem unaware headline of ""RADON IS THE LEADING CAUSE..."" was very effective because it made me aware of a problem that I needed to solve. 
   * If instead you spoke to a very aware and sophisticated market you may have a headline like ""Rado-Tech is the leading detection system with up to 99% accuracy compared to leading brands"" This would resonate more with people that are in the market for a radon detector but want the most accurate one.
* **Offer**
   * Offers are one of the most powerful levers you can pull that can change the performance of an ad. Varying up offers is a great thing to test and can open up different markets as well.
   * ***Example:*** running a 70% off digital course sale may get you price sensitive shoppers while running a buy 1 get 2 free may bring in people who are looking to maximize their learnings buy buying multiple courses.

**Note:** in general, I am focused on testing products, offers, creatives and angles nowadays. These are the levers that make the biggest difference in results. 

**Media Type**

You can change up your media type as a way to diversify your creatives. Here are the different types you have available to you:

* Static Images
* Videos
* Carousels
* Collection Ads
* Dynamic Catalog Ads

**Note:** there are people out there that frequently because of static images. Therefore, Meta will serve them mainly static image ads. If you are only making video ads, your ads are likely not being served to them. Create static images to reach them. 

**Creative Framework**

Changing up your creative framework is another way to diversify your creatives. These are tried and true templates for ads:

* Benefits Focused
* Product/Service Focused
* Us vs. Them
* Giveaway
* Before & After
* Quiz
* Educational
* Offer Forward
* PAS - Problem -> Agitate -> Solution
* UGC / Talking Head
* Day-in-the-life
* Story Telling
* Case Study / Social Proof
* News Article
* Listicle / Countdowns
* Founder Story
* Trend Jacking
* Organic Content
* and more...

**Note:** I see a lot of people making the mistake of trying to force a creative framework instead of letting the market research dictate the creative framework. These frameworks are all tools - use the right one for the job at hand. 

**Style**

You can change up the style of your ad to create some diversity as well. This refers to the production quality, imagery, and overall visual 'feel' of your ad. Some examples include:

* Lo-Fi / Raw / Organic Native
   * Think un-edited, raw style videos or images that feel like organic content. These can work really well which is way many top brands shoot ads for Meta on iPhones.
* Hi-Fi / Polished
   * Think high end tv-style commercials. Though more expensive and complex to produce, these obviously still work.
* AI
   * AI-videos and statics can be extremely powerful. With some creativity, your possibilities are endless. I am personally not a fan of AI-UGC avatars that advertisers pass off as authentic humans...I think those diminish trust and arean't that effective on most populations (aside from older generations I suppose). AI ads that are very on-the-nose (obviously AI) I think are extremely effective.

1o7bgje,https://www.reddit.com/r/utis/comments/1o7bgje/pls_help_uti_symptoms_possible_embedded_uti_no/,PLS HELP! UTI symptoms - possible embedded uti? No answers from doctors,"Hi everyone — apologies for the essay! I’m really struggling and would appreciate any advice or if anyone’s gone through something similar.

Quick timeline / summary of symptoms & tests:
	•	Had unprotected sex for first time and shortly after developed UTI symptoms (burning when I pee), (urgency to pee) (not feelings satisfied) (no blood in urine) 

	•	Took a 7-day course of Keflex without doing urine test it was prescribed over Telehealth (keflex) which helped initially, but symptoms returned/changed.
	•	I then took Methenamine hippurate (1 g) — I was on that for about two weeks after finishing antibiotics and this is when the burning really started/getting worse and moving to my fallopian tubes (This was back in July.)

      - started birth control - made me so irritable and slightly relieved some pain but eventually had to get off it after 2 months as it was causing too much pain in my calves

	•	I was sent for scans (endometriosis/DIE scan) and colonoscopy/ endoscopy — nothing showed up. I have PCOS (so wanted to rule out gynecological causes), but all bloods for food allergies and standard STI/STDs tests came back normal/clean.

    - Note that I did feel the burning fade whilst doing the colonoscopy prep. Surgeon said “looks like I have IBS” 

    - Got more STI/STD screenings as I thought a 7 week exposure wasn’t enough. It was all clear 
	
•	Because I thought it might be pelvic infection, I completed three courses of antibiotics used for PID — still no relief from the urgency to pee. The burning has relieved slightly.

    - I was feeling great after the injection I felt all my symptoms go, then I had a coffee and it brought the burning back?

    - I was thinking interstitial cystitis but I don’t believe it as this all began when I only became sexually active 

	•	At this point I’m leaning toward the idea of an embedded uti (i.e., bacteria hiding in biofilms or not detected by standard cultures) — which might explain why methenamine or the other antibiotics didn’t clear it.

	•	I’ve seen MicroGenDX’s urine test (they do PCR/NGS and can detect organisms that routine cultures miss), but sending a sample to the US is expensive (I can’t afford another ~$500 after paying for colonoscopy/endoscopy).

	•	I feel frustrated and stuck — symptoms persist and the usual tests and scans have been normal. Currently still experiencing burning though the antibiotics relieved slightly, moved down to my bladder now as I have frequent urgency to pee, burning when peeing, never feeling satisfied & yellow discharge which could indicate infection. Lower back is in so much pain!!! I’ve been to doctors, ED in hospital & specialists but I have no relief 

I’m worried standard urine culture missed something as I have no other answers 

Questions for anyone who’s been through this or knows more:
	1.	Has anyone here had a similar course (post-sex UTI → standard antibiotics → persistent burning despite negative cultures and scans)? What eventually helped?
	2.	Has anyone tried expanded urine culture or PCR-based urine testing in Australia (or locally) and had results that helped?
	3.	Any recommendations for affordable labs/GP pathways in Australia that will do more advanced urine testing (EQUC, urine PCR panels, or similar) without sending samples overseas?
	4.	Any tips for what to ask my GP or how to advocate to get these tests done?

Thanks so much — I’m sick of feeling brushed off and just want answers.

1o7bdtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o7bdtt/what_makes_icepure_cto10_filter_a_top_choice/,What Makes ICEPURE CTO10 Filter a Top Choice? Detailed Review Inside!,"The ICEPURE CTO10 Whole House CTO Carbon Sediment Water Filter Cartridge has made quite the impression on my household as I’ve been putting it to work over the past few weeks. It’s not often I find a water filter that both satisfies my functional needs and aligns with my budget, but this specific filter has a lot going for it. That said, there are a handful of considerations that might matter to certain users. Diving into the nitty-gritty details, I’ll share my personal experience with its performance, build quality, and value proposition.

**Quality Design and Build**  
Right from unboxing, the thoughtfulness of the design is evident. The cartridge measures 2.5"" x 10"" and feels robust in hand. It’s constructed mainly from carbon and boasts certification under the NSF/ANSI42 standard by IAPMO, which reassured me about its chlorine reduction capabilities and safety. As someone who’s picky when it comes to what my family consumes, knowing the certification exists was a major relief. Using U.S.-based technology is another cherry on top, making the cartridge feel reliable. While the material quality exceeded expectations, the filter's lightweight construction (only 3.37 pounds for the entire pack of four) makes it a breeze to handle during installation.

**Filter Performance in Real-World Use**  
I tested the filter on a standard whole-house RO system, and the results spoke for themselves. The clarity and taste improvement of the water were apparent almost immediately. Leveraging advanced Sintering Technology, the filter claims to remove up to 99% of chlorine, finer particles, and sediment, and from my tests, that seems pretty accurate. I tried brewing coffee and tea after installing this filter, and trust me, that unpleasant chlorine taste some filters fail to manage is completely absent here. However, if you’re drawing water from a well that contains a lot of mud or sand, you might not achieve the same stellar performance because the filter can clog more quickly.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Certification ensures chlorine reduction, crucial for better-tasting water.  
- Efficient filtration leaves water crystal-clear for drinking and cooking.  
- Longevity up to 13,000 gallons (depending on water quality), saving frequent replacements.  

**Key Downsides**  
- Only optimal for tap water and can struggle with heavy well water sediment.  
- Compatible with multiple systems, but double-checking fittings is recommended to avoid connection issues.  

**Ease of Installation**  
When I installed it in my RO system, the process was delightfully simple, and the compatibility with a wide range of standard 10-inch filtration systems made it even better. Seeing it fit perfectly with my existing setup, I didn’t need any additional tools or extra purchases, which felt like a huge plus. Models like DuPont, Culligan, Whirlpool, and GE systems are all listed as compatible—though I would suggest cross-checking the specifications, just in case. For those who want a no-fuss replacement, I can confidently say this filter gets the job done without unnecessary hassle.

**Check [ICEPURE CTO10] price on Amazon.**

**Comparison Among Competitive Options**  
Having also used Pentek CBC-10 and GE FXWTC in the past, I’ve experienced firsthand how ICEPURE stacks up. The GE FXWTC offers similar chlorine reduction but comes at a steeper price, while Pentek CBC-10 is fairly comparable in filtration quality but doesn’t last as long between replacements. ICEPURE, however, strikes a good balance with great filtration efficiency, resulting in clean-tasting water for a fraction of the cost. That said, I noticed Pentek has fewer clogging issues with sediment-heavy well water—something to consider for users on such systems.

**Cost Effectiveness**  
As a pack of four, this filter is quite practical if you’re looking to cut costs over time. Other single-pack filters I’ve used may perform well but tend to add up in price due to their shorter lifespans. The ICEPURE CTO10, paired with its long service life and great performance, made me feel like it’s worth the expense. Of course, pricing fluctuates, but I’d easily consider this one of the most budget-friendly investments for anyone dealing with chlorinated tap water.

This data corroborates my analysis below that estimated 7,000 male combatants were not placed on ANY LIST by Hamas, to hide their losses. It may be even greater than that. Trump recently confirmed that 25,000 Hamas combatants were killed.

Prior analysis of Hamas fatality data showed that even they acknowledged that 73% of fatalities of combat age were male. But it appears now it's even higher than that. Proving a highly targeted war against male combatants conducted by the IDF.

# No family, no stability, no social fabric: the anguish of Gaza’s wounded orphans 

# As the number of WCNSFs – ‘wounded child, no surviving family’ – grows, charities struggle to find adults to look after them



Within a few months, the war in Gaza had already made its own addition to the vocabulary of emergency medical assistance with the world’s most heartbreaking acronym: WCNSF, [“wounded child, no surviving family”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/22/the-plight-of-gazas-wcnsfs-wounded-child-no-surviving-family).

Over two years of bombardment and famine the problem has worsened, even though in the constant chaos created by Israeli bombing and evacuation orders, which fragment communities and scatter them around the Gaza Strip, it is hard to keep track of children separated from their families.

The UN’s child protection agency, Unicef, cited [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza) health ministry statistics from early September, recording 2,596 children who had lost both parents, and a further 53,724 who had lost either their father (47,804) or mother (5,920).



There is no data on how many parentless children have also been wounded, but, even as the first phase of a ceasefire deal to end the long war was agreed on Thursday, Gaza has the highest rate of child amputations of any modern conflict.

On 13 August, a three-year-old girl, Wesam, was asleep with her five-year-old brother, Zuheir, her pregnant mother, Nour, her father, Moatassem, and her grandparents, when the family house in Gaza City was bombed. Wesam was the only survivor, but sustained serious wounds to her leg and abdomen, including a lacerated liver and kidney, and severe psychological trauma.

Unicef said she was in “urgent need of medical evacuation abroad for advanced treatment, particularly to save her left leg from the risk of amputation”.

The Israeli onslaught on Gaza has left thousands of children like Wesam in its wake – alone and often critically wounded. There are so many such children that overworked trauma surgeons simply scrawl WCNSF on their files.

“It is the first conflict that such a term was needed,” said Kieran King, the humanitarian head of [War Child](https://www.warchild.org.uk/donate-gazaemergencyappeal-2024-paidsearch?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20778912870&gbraid=0AAAAAD2Tu6Rfmgv60YkuJiKCZYpXNjjyv&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Y3HBhCxARIsAN7931XIY-TCv9VBcwYmReBOOzyfL44HIbWCgrcKP5BEVkB-Tp9TP9WKZUcaAgqzEALw_wcB), a UK-based charity and one of the organisations trying to protect and care for wounded orphans in Gaza. “It was born out of the emergency medical teams, people who have worked across every conflict since forever, and coined this term WCNSF because they’d never had to deal with the child protection challenge on this scale.”

Jacob Granger, an emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières now in Deir al-Balah, southern Gaza, said wounded children were being brought to MSF field hospitals without family members all the time.

Granger said: “We try to stabilise their situation and treat their wounds, but after treating someone, often there is no stability whatsoever for that person.

“It’s not like there is a social fabric or social institution that is able to support children. There’s a community mechanism, people who take care of children who have lost their parents, or there are other agencies who can try to find the family, if there is someone that’s left, or an institution that could shelter orphans, but it’s a drop in the ocean.”

Unicef said it provided “short-term emergency care to children at high risk – lost, orphaned, and separated children – to provide immediate safety for children after an incident, while social workers trace family members who can provide long-term care for a child.”

War Child is one of a small number of humanitarian organisations that get calls from the emergency clinics about WCNSF cases, and its social workers comb the displaced camps looking for unaccompanied children then try to match them with people in the camps who are prepared to look after them.

[](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/oct/08/young-lives-cut-short-on-an-unimaginable-scale-the-18457-children-on-gazas-list-of-war-dead)

Among the children in one of the community centres supported by War Child is 13-year-old Radeh, who witnessed her mother being killed by a sniper, having already lost her father in the war.

“This left her with symptoms of shock, including being withdrawn and anxious, as well as suffering from headaches, stomach pain, nightmares and anxiety,” a War Child report said, noting that Radeh was receiving support from specialists to “manage overwhelming emotions” and finding some comfort in activities such as drawing.

King said: “In a usual conflict scenario, that would involve relatives, and we would provide follow-up support and make sure that safeguarding was accounted for and assessed.

“That’s often not possible in Gaza, where children often don’t have any surviving relatives, or at least none that can be identified or found, because it is chaos. People are in displacement camps and constantly being forcibly evacuated. In the case of Gaza, you need to find alternative care solutions, and there is a database of families who are willing to take in other children, who could then be assessed and supported and monitored.”

Finding such families is extremely hard when food is in such short supply. Badly wounded children, often with amputated limbs, have little chance of making the trip south in accordance with Israeli evacuation orders issued to the roughly 1 million residents of Gaza City.

To find a car that will take a wounded child can cost hundreds of dollars, often in cash, for which you have to pay a premium of about 40% – far beyond the means of most Gaza families. Anyone who remains in Gaza City has been deemed by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, as “[terrorists or terrorist supporters](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/01/israel-last-opportunity-for-gaza-city-residents-to-leave)”, implying they are legitimate military targets.

Children, and especially boys, are increasingly grouping together for survival, looking in rubbish heaps for anything to eat or sell, or using their strength in numbers to group at food distribution points, an extremely risky tactic reflecting sheer desperation.

“There’s a lot of children on the street during the day – whether they still have a family or not is more difficult to assess,” Granger said, noting that the consequences of childhood trauma and the destruction of families are beginning to make themselves clear. “What we see is that the behaviour of these children is abnormally aggressive. So you will find a six-year-old or an eight-year-old boy sometimes yelling at our car as if he was an angry 40-year-old man.”

The mental harm inflicted on this generation of children in Gaza is incalculable, even for those who still have a family. Before he was injured, 12-year-old Ahmad Abu Hilal supplemented his family’s tiny income by selling coffee in the sprawling al-Mawasi camp on Gaza’s southern coast.

“He had big ambitions,” his mother, Sabreen Abu Hilal, recalled. “He dreamed of becoming wealthy, buying a Jeep to give me, and becoming a great doctor who could treat the wounded. He also loved football and dreamed of becoming a talented player. He was always working hard to make his dreams come true.”

All those aspirations were ripped apart by an Israeli shell fired into a crowd in nearby Khan Younis, where Ahmad had gone to visit his aunt. Shrapnel tore off the back of one of his thighs.

“After the injury, Ahmad’s physical and psychological condition deteriorated severely. His health and mental state have been in decline since then,” his mother said. “At first, he was unconscious. When he woke up, he was in shock and in severe pain. He kept crying and blaming himself, asking why he had gone there, even though he had no way of knowing what would happen.”

Ahmad is still reliant on painkillers and needs his wound to be cleaned regularly.

“The doctors said his injury is extremely serious and that he will need a long time to recover,” his mother said. “My biggest fear is that he may never walk again or that his wound will not heal.”

The bewilderment and anguish accompanying serious injury is exponentially greater for children without a family support network.

“Just imagine the mental health impact on a child who, each time they try to walk again, or stand up, which is a reflex, they would recall the moment when they lost their legs and the members of their family,” Granger said. “And this is for the rest of their life, knowing that physically and mentally the prerequisites for overcoming trauma, safety and security are impossible for the people here. Nowhere is safe in Gaza.”

 I’m a 29 year old trans man, living in the states . So, what am I all about? Well, aside from the obvious (being a trans dude), I’m currently in the process of getting a book published! It’s been a long and wild ride, and honestly, still feels a bit surreal to even type that out.  This whole experience has been both incredibly rewarding and incredibly challenging. The writing process itself was cathartic, allowing me to explore some really deep and personal themes. But then came the querying process, which felt like throwing my heart into a black hole and hoping something would stick. And now, navigating the publishing world  working with editors, thinking about marketing, the whole shebang  is a whole new level of daunting. I'm not saying this to brag , but more to give you a glimpse into what occupies a lot of my brain space these days. It also means I’m always up for talking about writing, the publishing industry, creative processes, overcoming writer's block, or just general bookish things. Maybe you're a writer too? Or a voracious reader looking for recommendations? Let's chat! Okay, enough about the book for now. What else am I into?  I genuinely enjoy discussing complex topics, exploring different perspectives, and challenging my own assumptions. I'm interested in philosophy, psychology, sociology, spirituality (though not necessarily in a religious way), current events, and the big questions about life and existence. I'm also fascinated by personal growth, self-improvement, and the human condition. I'm not afraid to get vulnerable and talk about the tough stuff, and I appreciate that in others as well.  Besides writing, I also enjoy painting, drawing, playing music , photography, digital art, coding, graphic design. I'm definitely not a professional at any of them, but I find the process of creating something to be incredibly fulfilling. I find that the process of creating something from nothing is deeply satisfying, even if the end result isn't perfect. It's about the journey, not just the destination, right? I love spending time in nature, whether it's hiking in the mountains, exploring local parks, or just relaxing by a lake. Fresh air and sunshine do wonders for the soul. I'm also perfectly content with a cozy night in, curled up with a good book or binge watching a new show. It really depends on my mood and the weather .  I love kayaking, I'm trying to get into rock climbing, I'm obsessed with finding the best coffee shops in town, I'm always up for a board game night As a gay trans person, I'm naturally passionate about LGBTQ+ rights and equality. I also care deeply about other social justice issues, such as racial justice, environmental protection, and economic equality. I try to stay informed and engaged, and I'm always looking for ways to make a positive impact on the world. I am always up for a chat on politics as long as the person im speaking with is respectful of others with different viewpoints.  I value honesty and transparency. Let's be real with each other. ,  I want to connect with people who are willing to listen to different perspectives and treat others with kindness and respect, even if they don't agree with them.  Life can be tough, and it's important to have people in your corner who will cheer you on and offer support when you need it.  I appreciate people who are able to express themselves clearly and honestly, and who are willing to listen actively to what others have to say.  Putting yourself out there, especially your *heart* , feels a bit like standing  in a crowded room. But, deep down, I believe that the most beautiful connections are forged in vulnerability. So, here I am, confessing: I'm a hopeless romantic. Unapologetically, irrevocably, and perhaps even a little ridiculously, a hopeless romantic.  I know. The term comes with baggage. It conjures images of doe eyed naiveté, unrealistic expectations, and a penchant for cheesy rom coms (guilty on that last one, by the way  ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a masterpiece, fight me!). But for me, being a hopeless romantic isn't about living in a fantasy world. It's about choosing to see the world *with* hope, and believing in the profound power of love to transform our lives and the lives of those around us. It's about recognizing the inherent beauty in human connection and actively seeking it out. In a world that often feels cynical and guarded, where swiping right is more common than holding hands, and carefully curated online personas often mask deeper insecurities, I choose to remain optimistic. I choose to believe that genuine connection is still possible. I choose to believe that there are others out there who, like me, yearn for something deeper than fleeting infatuation.  I'm not talking about staging a flash mob proposal (although, if that's your thing, go for it!). For me, a grand gesture is about demonstrating a depth of commitment and understanding. It's about paying attention. It's remembering that tiny detail I mentioned weeks ago and surprising me with a thoughtful gift. It’s planning a weekend getaway that caters perfectly to my interests, or simply showing up at my door with my favorite takeout after a particularly rough day. But equally, I cherish the small, everyday acts of love: a hand squeeze across the table, a spontaneous ""I love you"" whispered in my ear, a perfectly brewed cup of coffee waiting for me in the morning. It's the consistent, quiet acts of kindness that build a foundation of trust and intimacy.  Physical attraction is important, of course. Chemistry is undeniable. But for me, true connection lies in the realm of the emotional. I crave vulnerability, honesty, and the kind of deep, soulful conversations that leave you feeling seen and understood. I want to know your hopes, your fears, your dreams, and your insecurities. I want to be the person you can confide in, the one who knows you better than anyone else in the world. I want to build a safe space where we can be our authentic selves, without judgment or pretense. I believe that true intimacy is forged through shared experiences, open communication, and a willingness to be vulnerable with one another. Life isn't always glamorous. There will be bills to pay, errands to run, and dishes to wash. But even in the midst of the ordinary, I believe there's always the potential for magic. It's about finding joy in the simple things: a shared laugh over a silly meme, a quiet evening spent reading together, a spontaneous dance party in the kitchen while cooking dinner. It's about turning everyday moments into cherished memories. It's about seeing the beauty in the ordinary and appreciating the small blessings that life has to offer. When I love, I love with my whole heart. I am fiercely loyal, unwaveringly supportive, and deeply committed. I will be your biggest cheerleader, your confidante, and your partner in crime. I will celebrate your successes, comfort you in your failures, and always have your back, no matter what. I believe that a relationship is a partnership, a team effort, and I am committed to working together to build a strong, lasting, and fulfilling connection. I don’t mean a rigid, meticulously planned future. But I do crave a shared vision. I want to dream together, to imagine the possibilities, to build a life that is full of purpose, passion, and joy. I want to travel the world, explore new cultures, and create lasting memories side by side. I want to build a home filled with love, laughter, and a sense of belonging. I want to grow old together, hand in hand, watching the sunset and knowing that we’ve built something truly special. Okay, so I can't *literally* give you the world. I don't own it (yet!). But what I *can* offer is my unwavering love, my unwavering support, my unwavering commitment to making your life richer, fuller, and more meaningful. I want to share my passions with you, to introduce you to the things that I love, and to learn from you in return. I want to explore new hobbies together, to challenge each other to grow, and to create a life that is filled with adventure and excitement. I want to be your rock, your sanctuary, and your biggest source of happiness. But here's the thing: being a hopeless romantic also comes with its challenges. It means being vulnerable to disappointment, to heartbreak, and to the occasional eye roll from more cynical friends. It means having to navigate a dating world that often feels superficial and transactional. It means battling my own insecurities and anxieties, and sometimes wondering if my expectations are too high. And I realize that not everyone is going to be on board with my particular brand of romanticism. Some people are simply wired differently. Some people prefer a more practical, less emotionally driven approach to relationships. And that's perfectly okay.  But if you're still reading this, if you've resonated with anything I've said, then maybe, just maybe, you're the kind of person I'm looking for. I'm looking for someone who is kind, compassionate, and empathetic. Someone who values honesty, integrity, and open communication. Someone who is intelligent, curious, and passionate about life. Someone who is willing to be vulnerable, to take risks, and to embrace the imperfections that make us human. Someone who is not afraid to dream big, to laugh often, and to love fiercely. I'm looking for someone who is ready to build a real, authentic, and meaningful connection. Someone who is ready to share their world with me, and allow me to share mine with them. Someone who is ready to embark on a journey of growth, discovery, and endless possibilities. So, if you're out there, if you're a fellow hopeless romantic searching for your partner in crime, your soulmate, your lobster (yes, I went there!), then reach out. Let's talk. Let's connect. Let's see if we can create a little magic together. Because I truly believe that the world is a much more beautiful place when it's shared with someone you love. And I'm ready to share mine.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

He’s maybe 10 years older than me, 80 lbs over weight, always tired, never exercises, mood swings, drinks…

I know I felt a big change in my metabolism at around 32 years old but I adjusted… maybe it’s because I watched my dad yo-yo with weight gain/loss and health for so many decades. My dad was a big strong farm boy, 6’4” 200 lbs and ate like a horse. As time moved forward and his body changed his diet did not. He’s better for a few years here and there but typically still eats like a 19 year old farm boy. My boss, and many other men I know, seem caught in this terrible cycle. My boss always bolsters about his wrestling years but damn dude you get winded taking the steps… I don’t get it. I don’t understand being that blind to your actions.

I’m trying my best to move on and get back into the dating world again.

I [32F] met this guy [28M] on a dating app. We first went out for coffee and had a good time. We talked about a second date. We were texting every day and decided to go out again for a second date a week later, which was this past weekend. We went to an escape room and then to an arcade. Overall, it was a good time.

One of the insecurities he talked about was how, in his past relationships, his exes weren’t into sports or working out and would call him names like “too skinny” or give him a hard time because he watched sports.

I love watching sports and grew up playing them too. I genuinely enjoy watching football and working out. Eating healthy and living an active lifestyle are very important to me. If my future boyfriend were to watch sports, it wouldn’t bother me. In fact, I’d enjoy it too. I also used to train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, boxing, and Muay Thai. He loves watching UFC and has always wanted to try mixed martial arts.

When we were at the arcade, my healthy competitiveness came out. We played some games, and I ended up winning all of them except for one. It was getting late, so he suggested we head out, which was fine by me. He then showed me around the area (I’m new in town) and asked if I wanted to go for a short walk so he could show me the area across the street with some shops and restaurants. I said sure, and that walk turned into a deep conversation.

He mentioned that he’s been noticing a pattern with his friends where he’s always the one reaching out first. I said a good friendship should go both ways; they should be there for you when you need them and vice versa. He agreed, and we kept talking. When we got to our cars, we talked for another 20+ minutes. Eventually, I said, “Alright, it’s time to go home,” and he gave me a casual hug before we left.

When I got home, I shared one of my favorite poems with him (it’s about friendship and fit our earlier conversation). In our text exchange, he thanked me for sharing it and said, “It was nice seeing you tonight, deep discussions and all.” I replied, “It was nice seeing you as well. Thank you for a fun night.” He reacted to my text with a heart, and it’s been three days since I’ve heard from him.

Since I haven’t heard back, I’m wondering if he’s not interested anymore, and if not, what could have caused it?

If he is interested, should he have sent some kind of text like “How’s it going?” or something similar? He knows I have a very rigorous schedule since I’m back in school getting my second degree in an accelerated program.

Is it okay for me to reach out to him, or would that come across as desperate?

If he is interested, why hasn’t he replied again? Is he trying to see if I’ll reach out first?

How should I move forward?

The new assistant, Ava’s latest hire, dumped a full cup of coffee onto my face in front of the entire executive board.

“You’re a parasite who does nothing but hide in his office playing video games, and you have the nerve to question my proposal?”

His voice echoed in the silent boardroom.

“I’m telling you you’re fired. Get out!”

Calmly, I rose to my feet. I wiped the sticky, lukewarm liquid from my skin and looked at Ava.

She frowned, her gaze deliberately darting away from mine. She chose silence.

A slow smile spread across my face. I pulled out my phone.

“Dad, you listening?” I asked, the speakerphone on.

“They’re telling me to get out.”

1

It was a Monday. I was deep in the final push of a strategic campaign on my laptop when a sharp knock broke my concentration.

“Mr. Sterling? Carter Hayes needs all department heads in the main conference room in ten minutes.” It was Chloe from Admin, her voice rushed.

I didn’t look up, my fingers a blur across the keyboard.

“Not going. Busy.”

In the six months I’d been embedded in this company, I hadn’t attended a single meeting. It wasn't that I was exempt; I simply couldn’t be bothered.

“But…” Chloe hesitated, her voice dropping. “Carter was very specific. He said no one gets to miss this one. He said it was an order from Ms. Monroe.”

My fingers froze. My character, a meticulously crafted warrior, was instantly annihilated by the level boss. As the screen faded to a dismal gray, I swore under my breath and shut the laptop.

By the time I arrived, the conference room was already full. As I entered, a ripple of strange looks and whispered conversations followed me.

“What’s Liam Sterling doing here?”

“I thought he didn’t do meetings.”

“Who knows. Must be Carter’s doing. He specifically requested him.”

“Carter’s been looking for a reason to pick a fight with him. This should be good.”

I ignored the murmurs and chose a seat in the farthest corner, pulling out my phone to resume the game I’d been forced to abandon.

A full thirty minutes passed before Ava Monroe and Carter Hayes finally made their grand entrance. Carter clutched a stack of files, a smug, triumphant smile plastered on his face.

“Thank you all for making the time on such short notice,” Ava began, her eyes scanning the room. They rested on me for less than a second before moving on. “Carter has a major proposal he’d like to present to you all today.”

Carter cleared his throat and launched into a long-winded speech about his “revolutionary” new marketing strategy.

I split my attention, one thumb navigating my game while my ears picked up the broad strokes. The more I heard, the more absurd it sounded. The budget was astronomical, and the entire concept was fundamentally misaligned with our company’s market position.

“...and so, I propose an immediate eighty-million-dollar investment to dominate the high-end market sector within the next three months!” Carter concluded, his voice ringing with passion.

A sparse, hesitant applause fluttered through the room.

I couldn’t help myself. Without looking up from my phone, I said, “For eighty million, you could just throw cash off the roof of the building. You’d get more buzz and better engagement.”

The room went dead silent.

Ava’s brow furrowed.

“What did you say?” Carter’s voice was suddenly sharp.

I finally lifted my head, my expression one of pure boredom.

“I said your proposal is full of holes.”

I ticked them off on my fingers.

“First, your target demographic is completely wrong. Second, your channel allocation is a mess. And third, your entire method for calculating ROI is a fantasy.”

I leaned back in my chair.

“You might as well be setting eighty million dollars on fire. At least that would make a nice glow.”

Carter’s face flushed a deep, blotchy red. He snatched his coffee cup from the table and stormed towards me.

“You’re a parasite who does nothing but hide in his office playing video games, and you have the nerve to question my proposal?” he roared.

And then—

Splash.

The hot liquid cascaded down my face. It soaked the collar of my white shirt, staining it a muddy brown. The entire room held its breath.

“Liam Sterling, I’m announcing you’re fired. Get out!”

2

Carter stood over me, chest puffed out like a conquering hero.

I rose slowly, pulling a linen handkerchief from my pocket and methodically dabbing the coffee from my face. Then I turned my gaze to Ava.

She frowned, looked away, and said nothing.

A genuine laugh escaped me then. A real one.

I held up my phone, where the call was still active on speaker. “Dad, you listening?”

“They’re telling me to get out.”

The line was silent for two beats before a deep, resonant voice replied.

“Understood. I’ll make the arrangements.”

The only reason I was in this office, in this city, was because of a pact made by my grandfather decades ago. An engagement. Ava Monroe was my fiancée. I despised the idea of an arranged marriage, a dynastic merger, but my father had been relentless, wielding the weight of family duty and legacy like a club.

So I’d agreed.

To “foster a deeper connection,” my father had insisted I take a position at Monroe Industries. For six months, I’d played the part of a do-nothing manager, a ghost in the corporate machine. In reality, I had been quietly leveraging Sterling resources, making calls, greasing wheels, and single-handedly ensuring the company’s performance soared, paving the way for a successful IPO. Monroe Industries became a market darling, and Ava Monroe’s name appeared on the Forbes list of rising entrepreneurs.

I’d done all that, but we barely spoke. During our handful of stilted, obligatory dates, it became clear she knew I was the man from the family arrangement, but she had no idea of the true scale of the Sterling family name.

…

I sat back down in my corner chair, picked up my phone, and unpaused my game. On the screen, my character respawned. My fingers flew across the glass, the tension in the room melting into the background.

Carter’s face went from red to a sickly shade of purple. He clearly hadn’t expected me to so thoroughly ignore his display of authority.

He slammed his hand on the table. “Liam! What do you think this is? Everyone is focused on a critical meeting, and you’re playing games?”

A cold smile touched my lips. “I’ve already hit my targets for the entire fiscal year. What’s a little game?”

“If you don’t get out right now, I’m calling security!”

“Be my guest,” I replied without looking up.

The other executives exchanged uneasy glances. Some pretended to study their documents; others shot furtive looks at Ava, waiting for her to act.

Finally, she stood.

Today she was wearing a sharp, tailored black dress, her hair pulled back in a severe knot. She looked at me, her expression a mixture of impatience and disdain.

“Liam, your performance metrics are excellent,” she said. Her voice was level, but it carried an undeniable authority. “But this is a place of business, not your trust fund playground. Please leave the conference room. You’re disrupting the meeting.”

My fingers paused. My character died again.

I looked up and met her gaze, a playful smirk on my lips. “Are you sure you want me to leave, Ms. Monroe?”

Ava’s frown deepened, her voice turning to ice.

“I won’t repeat myself. If you have any professional decency, you know when to walk away.”

“And if I don’t want to walk away?”

“Then don’t blame me for what happens next.”

Seeing Ava firmly on his side, Carter’s courage surged. He lunged at me and slapped the phone out of my hand.

It hit the polished floor with a sickening crack, the screen exploding into a spiderweb of fractures.

“Don’t push your luck, Sterling!” he snarled, grabbing the front of my shirt and hauling me upwards. “Ava gave you an order! What are you still doing here? Get out!”

From his very first day as Ava’s assistant, Carter had made his dislike for me clear. I once overheard him through Ava’s office door, his voice dripping with condescension. “Ms. Monroe, this isn’t a charity. Paying a six-figure salary to a guy who just plays games all day is a slap in the face to everyone who actually works here.”

Ava hadn’t replied, but through the glass, I saw her hands pause over a document.

After that, Carter grew bolder. He’d make veiled comments in department meetings about my “impressive contributions.”

“Some people,” he’d say with a theatrical sigh, “collect a hefty paycheck but can’t even be bothered to show up for a meeting. Must be nice to be on a permanent vacation.”

The whispers around the office grew louder. I was a nepo-baby, a rich kid slumming it. I slept in my office. They started a betting pool on when I’d finally be fired.

I knew about all of it. I just didn’t care.

3

But the more I ignored him, the more entitled he became. This was his moment, and he was reveling in it.

I don’t tolerate bullies. I clamped my hand around his wrist and twisted. Hard.

“Ah!” Carter cried out, his grip on my shirt releasing instantly. As he stumbled back, his arm slammed against the edge of the heavy oak conference table. There was a sharp crack as his watch face met the wood.

He staggered, then looked down at his wrist. The color drained from his face.

A deep, ugly scratch now marred the crystal of his expensive Patek Philippe, glaring under the recessed lighting.

“You… you…” he stammered, his hand trembling as he held it up. His eyes were blazing. “Liam, do you have any idea how much this watch costs? This was a birthday gift from Ava! It’s worth eighty thousand dollars!”

I slowly straightened the collar of my wrinkled shirt.

“You lost your footing. Not my problem.”

“Liam!” Ava’s voice was a whip crack. “That’s enough! You disrupted a meeting, and now you’ve deliberately destroyed personal property. On behalf of the company, I am officially terminating your employment. Now, gather your things and leave.”

Carter, seeing his advantage, pressed on. “Ava, don’t just let him walk away! He has to pay for the watch!”

The room was silent. Every eye was on me, a mix of pity and morbid curiosity. They were waiting for the show.

“Fine. I’ll pay,” I said. “Eighty thousand, was it?”

I bent down to retrieve my shattered phone. The screen was a disaster, but it still lit up. As I dialed a number, Carter sneered. “What eighty thousand? It’s eight hundred thousand!”

I paused, looking at him. “Are you sure about that?”

“Of course, I’m sure!” Carter puffed out his chest. “A gift from Ava is priceless! Eight hundred thousand is a bargain, and I’m being generous! Ask anyone here if I’m wrong!”

He knew my official salary. He knew I couldn’t afford that. This was about humiliation.

The other executives, sensing the shift in power, chimed in.

“He’s right. A gift from Ms. Monroe can’t be measured in money,” the CFO said, adjusting his glasses. “You should just pay it, Liam.”

“This isn't a non-profit, Sterling. You break it, you buy it,” the head of marketing added with a smirk. “Though at your salary, you’ll probably be paying it off until you retire.”

A wave of cruel laughter rippled through the room. They had despised the ""slacker"" in their midst for months, and now they were enjoying my downfall.

Ava stood by, her brow furrowed, but she did nothing to stop them.

Their taunts didn't bother me. I looked straight at Carter. “Eight hundred thousand. That’s the final number? No more additions?”

He blinked, then let out a sharp, derisive laugh. “Still playing the big shot, Liam? We all know what your paycheck looks like. How are you going to pay? With your life?”

I ignored him and put the phone to my ear.

“I need eight hundred thousand in cash delivered to the Monroe Industries boardroom. As soon as possible.”

Carter scoffed. “Right. Who are you trying to fool with that little performance?”

I didn’t answer. I just waited.

Less than ten minutes later, the conference room doors swung open. A man in a flawlessly tailored suit walked in, followed by three uniformed bank couriers carrying heavy briefcases.

He walked directly to me and bowed respectfully. “Mr. Sterling. Here is the eight hundred thousand you requested.”

I nodded. “Thank you for your promptness. You can set them down there.”

The cases were opened one by one, revealing stacks of crisp hundred-dollar bills that seemed to glow under the lights. The room fell into a stunned silence. You could have heard a pin drop.

Carter looked like he’d been punched in the gut. He stared at the money, then at the man in the suit.

Suddenly, the CFO’s face went white.

1o7b4vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1o7b4vy/the_one_who_doesnt_bleed_chapter_1/,The one who doesn't bleed chapter 1,"This is fiction, but not entirely.
It’s something between memory and metaphor — a piece of a moment I lived through, written the way I remember feeling it and just my brain doing my brain things and turning it into a story.
You could call it a story, but for me it’s more a way of processing my thoughts and coming to piece with them .


The Alfa sat where the road had given up, gravel crunching under tires that hadn’t been replaced in years. I leaned the seat all the way back, letting the fabric hold me like it knew every fracture I had. The dashboard lights faded against the dark outside, and only the soft glow of my phone cut through the shadows. Ona by Klinac droned quietly — a song for the quiet ruin of everything else.

A cheap beer sweated in my hand, condensation slipping down my fingers. Smoke curled lazily from the cigarette I hadn’t bothered to stub out, rising toward the roof, disappearing into nothing.

The car smelled faintly of damp fabric and asphalt, and I found comfort in that. It was broken, tired, barely alive — just like me. The gears, the rust, the worn clutch pedal beneath my foot; all of it reflected the state I’d been putting off acknowledging for months. Sitting there, everything slowed. Every creak of the suspension, every whisper of wind through a bent door frame felt louder than the world outside.

Then the song hit me fully, and a single tear ran down my cheek — unremarkable except for the weight it carried.

My phone buzzed. The glow caught my eye before I even thought of moving. I didn’t reach for it, just stared.
It was her — someone I used to know, still half a mystery. A friend from before. A girl who now worked at a hospital.

> “You around?”



That’s all it said at first. Then a few more lines: a job opening, nothing big, steady pay, stable enough to matter. She thought I might want it and asked if I was interested.

I let the words hang there, unprocessed, letting the pause stretch until it felt like silence. I thought about it. Sat with it. Let the music, the smoke, the beer, and the quiet pull me a little further from reality.

Time blurred — days, maybe just hours. I wasn’t counting. The only measure was the hangover of everything: the taste of stale beer, the acrid burn of smoke, the echo of a song that didn’t need words because I already knew them.

Then the first workday came. Not at some impossible hour like 3 AM, but normal time — the kind that reminds you other people still live on a schedule. Outside, the world moved: sunlight, traffic, footsteps, coffee. Inside, the Alfa still smelled of smoke and regret, still carried the weight of my body slouched in the seat. I watched the light shift through the windshield and realized I’d been waiting — for something to stir, for something to make the waiting worthwhile.

The phone buzzed again. I didn’t move immediately. I let it sit. Let the moment linger. Let myself feel it before reacting. The world had been quiet for so long, and now it offered a crack — small, fragile, but undeniably there.

By the end of it, I was parked in front of the hospital, cigarette lit, fabric seat still holding me.
I stared at the building, the glow of fluorescent lights washing over the asphalt, and thought to myself:

What have I gotten myself into?

Day 1 :

We visited vet for checkup. His Fever 103.5. Blood test came out normal. Slight elevation in WBC count. No tick fever. He was given antibiotics injection for cold/cough.

Day 2.

He vomitted some food. It was coffee brown in color with bloodish clot like substance in the vomit. We visited vet again. Fever was 104.5. He was given injection to reduce fever, drooling and vomit. So he was tested for kidney and liver function which came out normal. So he prescribed antibiotics tablets suspecting an infection.

Day 3:

Still no improvement is seen. Eyes are still droopy. Drooling resumes once injection efficacy reduces.
He has a mild fever 103.5. vet had no clue of why there is no improvement. So he decided to increase the dose 2 times a day. During the evening, his stomach looked bloated. The vet palpated his belly. It was normal

Day 4: 

Still no improvement. We went to the vet again. Doc inspected his throat. Some infection was found Doc did ultrasound for stomach. It was normal. Gave the same course of injection of again. Still doc was clueless about the root cause. So he suggested to go to a speciality hospital to run more extensive tests.


All this while his appetite remains normal. He drinks lot of water than normal. He has some difficulty in swallowing. He has been pooping/ urinating normally.  
He has been lethargic and full from day 1. Attaching tthe photos/videos.

It is apparently part of a limited edition collection. I can't find it on Fragrantica and there is only a basic entry for it on Perfumo.

What is this and why do I love it so much?! It is definitely familiar but I can't figure out what is smells like. The scent is an ambery/woody vanilla. I do get some fruity floral, but no coffee specifically. Longevity was decent, maybe 4 hours which is great for a $26 EDP.

Hey! I’m based in Kolkata and I’ve been wanting to find some kind of queer community here people to talk to, hang out with, maybe even join local meetups or small group events. It’s not always easy to find where the queer spaces actually are, and honestly, most of what I hear is just through word of mouth.

I know about a few names like Sappho for Equality, PLUS Kolkata, and the Pride Walk, but I’m curious if there are smaller, more casual meetups maybe a café where people hang out, or a safe space where it feels okay to just be yourself. I’ve heard of Porshi Café in Jodhpur Park being queer-friendly, but I’d love to know if there are other hidden gems too.

Also, if anyone knows of local Telegram or Discord groups where queer folks in Kolkata connect, that would be amazing. I think a lot of us are just looking for community without the pressure  somewhere to talk, share stories, or even just chill over coffee.

If you’re someone who’s part of the queer scene here, or even just figuring it out like me, feel free to drop a comment or message. Would love to hear what the community here is like and how people usually meet up safely.

If you’re someone who’s part of the queer scene here, or even just figuring things out like me, feel free to drop a comment or message. Would love to hear what the community here is like  and maybe build something together if it’s missing.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

A few of them have actually admitted to the fact I am mostly the last person they call if they are planning something and the last resort when everyone bails out. These are the things that I have tried to befriend/maintain friendships:
1. Being there for them during family emergencies.
2. Trying out hobbies with them when they suggest that.
3. Reached out to plan outings like stand-up comedy, coffee shops and movies.
4. Listened to them when they needed to vent and advised when they needed advice,
5. Stood with them and protected them when there has been a sexual harrassement case or some abuse.
6. Made handmade gifts or bought thoughtful gifts with thoughtful posts on their birthdays.

1o7atm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hostinger/comments/1o7atm6/hostinger_needs_to_reform_its_approach_to_abuse/,Hostinger Needs to Reform Its Approach to Abuse,"I've been a subscriber to Hostinger's VPS service for about 3 or 4 months now. I'm a first time VPS user (coming from years of shared hosting), so it's been a learning experience, but I think I've done quite well. I got Caprover up and running with all my web apps, I got docker-mailer running, I have my own repositories deploying to Caprover apps. It was great and I was very pleased with the service.

Then, about a week ago, my VPS suddenly went offline without warning. I didn't know what to make of it. Come to find out, it had been suspended due to abuse. I was baffled, as I certainly had no idea what abuse it might have been involved in; certainly none that I would've engaged in deliberately.

I got in touch with customer service, who told me that some sort of bot activity had caused the suspension. Further, I was shocked to be told that, in essence, ""this is strike one... after the third strike, you're done"". What? How can Hostinger take such a Draconian stance when they don't even give VPS admins a chance to resolve the malicious activity before issuing the suspension? I'm not a 24/7 IT manager: I have kids and a job and everyday life to attend to. This issue developed without my knowledge and, rather than Hostinger making an effort to work with me to resolve it ***before*** taking drastic action against me, they just shut everything down out of the blue.

Anyhow, they did remove the suspension with the ""three strikes"" warning and suggested that I improve my server's security. Within the first 24 hours, I was careful to get fail2ban installed and started dialing in the various jails. Then, scarcely 48 hours after the first suspension was removed, it was suddenly suspended all over again. My  heart sank. This time, I had the wherewithal to request some information on what exactly was triggering the abuse claim, since I absolutely wanted to root it out myself. You would think this would be the first thing Hostinger would offer its customers. You would think Hostinger ***wants*** to work with them to fix these issues, rather than merely condemning them out-of-hand with immediate suspension. I don't want malware on my server, after all! They did supply logs that could at least point me in the right direction, except now my account sits in limbo while their ""abuse team"" sips their coffee and casually leaves my entire online presence -cloud storage, password storage, client-facing websites- to collect dust on their proverbial desk while they idly get around to it. Meanwhile, my VPS is dead in the water.

And frankly, even when my VPS eventually does get the suspension removed and comes back online, why would I do anything besides backup all of my data and leave Hostinger? Thanks to them issuing two suspensions in less than a week, I'm at the precipice of permanent suspension now. One slip-up -one instance in which, despite my best efforts, some malware somehow makes it into my server somewhere- and without any forewarning my server is shut down forever. That's no way to foster confidence in a long term relationship. My VPS is basically a time-bomb now, ready to blow up in my face without warning if somehow some malware weasels in.

Hostinger needs to be issuing 48-hour advance notices of impending suspensions so that their VPS customers who are the ***victim*** of abusive software have the opportunity to resolve the issue before enduring the damning punishment of suspension and being placed one step closer toward losing everything. I'm so disappointed in how a company like Hostinger, which otherwise offers such a great service, would be so unhelpful and callous to the needs of a customer such as myself: so quick to condemn a customer as a deliberate abuser rather than a victim of abuse. An attitude of cooperative resolution would've gone so far toward cementing a positive relationship: ""Hey, we noticed aberrant activity on your VPS. Here's what we found. Can you please work on resolving this so we don't have to issue a suspension?"" That would've been such a valuable and productive approach. It's just too bad.",1,1760534429.0,Hostinger,2,1.0,False
1o7ase7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1o7ase7/the_credit_card_is_a_meta_item/,The credit card is a meta item.,"we're all playing the game of life right now. we have computers and phones, so don't convince yourself that there's no such thing as items and items influencing our playthrough. without those computers and phones, you would have never watched your favorite shows or played your favorite games. or met your internet friends. so there are items that affect our playthroughs.

if you were playing a videogame, and there was an item that made you do 5x damage, would you leave it there? or would you pick it up. the 5x damage buff means you kill the boss faster. the boss dying faster means you get hit less. you getting hit less means you die less. you die less means you're happier. you get more time to do other things, like kill more bosses.

I've never thought about traveling much. because im depressed and traveling seems so far away to me. but i realized, when you have a credit card.. nothing matters. plane tickets? type in the info, done. some pastry at a coffee shop? tap. done. you saw a jacket in a store? tap. done. need to pay for a train? tap. done.

of course you have to pay for it after. which is why you need j\*bs. but still, the credit card is a piece of plastic. this piece of plastic opens up endings and variety in your life playthrough. the credit card puts you into creative mode rather than survival mode.

  
edit : see everyone in the comments so far is in denial. that's because there are 2 groups in here. extremely privileged. and extremely poor. and there is no inbetween. 

the extremely privileged group does not want to acknowledge their mom's credit card and how meta it is. and how much they've benefited from it. the extremely poor group knows the credit card is very very far away.

tl:dr: Talked to M about her “flirting” making me uncomfortable — turns out she *wasn’t joking* and actually liked me. We had a long, honest conversation, cleared up the misunderstanding, and ended up going on a date. Now we’re officially together, and things are going surprisingly

Alright, so… a lot has happened. Like, honestly more than I ever imagined would occur when I posted that first thing. I just thought I would have some input on boundaries, not be experiencing a full-on romcom.

So after reading all of your suggestions (some ""talk to her,"" others ""to avoid her""), I went ahead and actually spoke with M. I cornered her after study group one day and informed her straight out that she was being too flirtatious towards me and making me uncomfortable. I explained that it reminded me of some not so great high school experiences and that I had no idea if she was serious or not, but that it was starting to mess with my head.

She simply stared at me for a second, saying nothing. Then she laughed — and my heart fell. I thought, ""Oh great, it's happening again."" But then she shot right back, ""No, no, I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing because I can't believe you actually thought I was joking.""

Turns out she wasn't playing me either. Apparently, the whole crew already knew she was interested in me. She'd had them laughing at her for weeks about how I ""kept missing the hints"" and she was running out of things to do short of making it obvious. So while I'm going crazy trying to figure out why she's out of my league and playing hard to get, she's literally throwing her shot.

The ""crazy"" aspect? My friends had a bet going about how many minutes it would take for someone to come clean. And by ""bet,"" I mean there was actually a literal spreadsheet. With odds. And a meme PowerPoint presentation.

So, after that awkward but honest conversation, we just ended up walking around to grab coffee and somehow ended up expending five hours in a constant stream of dialogue. We missed dinner, missed our bus, and walked half-way through town just talking about everything, our insecurities, our misperceptions of each other, even my aforementioned high school story that started this whole thing.

At the end of the night, she just looked at me and said, ""You know you're kind of an idiot, right?"" and kissed me. I don't even remember what I said, probably something stupid.

Now we're. dating? Officially? It still doesn't feel real. The group realized two days later when we accidentally showed up together with hands held, and everyone lost their minds. There was cheering. Someone brought cupcakes. The spreadsheet got ""archived.""

So yeah. Ten days ago I thought my friend was bullying me for fun, and now I'm dating her. Life is weird.",0,1760534345.0,relationships,2,0.46,False

I am missing work and thrown by this. I want to feel like I’ve got a predictable grip on this before the surgery but I can’t seem to find it. Is there a better birth control that worked for yall? Better diet? I will try anything to feel better and be able to get back to work and life. Everything is on pause.

Please send any advice or good news!

So, here’s the deal, I’ve been out of the game for a little over 7 years now. Life took a few unexpected turns, and I became a single dad. It’s been a wild, rewarding ride focusing on raising my little man, but now that the dust has settled a bit, I’m realizing I miss adult conversations, laughs, and yeah, maybe a bit of flirtatious fun too.

About me:

* 30 years old, down to earth and sarcastic by default, with a soft spot for dad jokes (sorry in advance).
* My hobbies include stepping on Lego in the dark, trying to cook like I’m on a cooking show, and pretending I understand how the school app works.
* I’m emotionally available, baggage-claimed, and just looking to connect. Whether it’s a witty exchange, flirty chats, or something that grows into more.

About you:

* Someone who’s open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn’t mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.
* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo’s asleep.

Not looking to rush anything. Just good convo, mutual vibes, and maybe some playful banter to break the ice.

It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I’m the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic, those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living..sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling... I capture confidence in its most seductive forms.

It’s not about posing, it’s about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera..I’m your classic Irish mischief-maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half-read book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks, off-the-cuff road trips, and the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I’m drawn to soul-deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator. Tell me—when was the last time you let someone really see you? And yes, I absolutely swap pics. It’s kind of my thing.

(Part 2),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1hmhe/the_night_shift_at_the_diner_pays_400_i_wish_id/)

I went back to the diner. 

Some of your comments got to me, and they made me realize that the best decision a mature and responsible woman would make is to see the debt to the rude vampire through. Because that is the right thing to do. 

Ok, no. I’m lying. 

Sunday morning came like a beacon in the dark. I woke up early and paced through my room for a few hours before gathering the courage to actually walk through the door. I hadn’t left my room in days, and even Roger had given up on trying to talk to me. He wasn’t even bringing food by anymore. 

But that day I had to leave. The bus that only came on Sundays was my only escape route from this town, and I was going to make it out. No matter what. 

I packed everything I owned into my back pack, and I left the uniform with which I had left the diner in a hurry last week neatly folded on the bed before leaving the room. (On a completely separate note, I really want to know what this is made out of. It didn’t tear with all of the… you know, and the blood stains washed right out of it). I didn’t even check out. That’s how desperate I was for this to go well. 

I walked quickly to the bus station, flinching at every shadow and at every noise. I’m a little bit embarrassed to admit that I even let out a tiny scream when a pigeon flew by me, but you all have to understand that I was terrified out of my mind. I didn’t know much about… anything at all really. I only knew that a crazy vampire who sucked so much of my blood that I passed out and claimed that I owed his some sort of life debt was running around loose in the town where I was staying. I couldn’t afford to let him get to me. Not even after he saved my life. 

So yes, I admit it. Despite the warnings and despite knowing deep down that leaving wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had, I still did it. 

Tried to, at least. 

The bus was running late. I knew that that wasn’t uncommon for small towns, so I still waited. I waited for an hour. And then two. I tried to blend in with my surroundings, I didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention to myself. But it didn’t really work out like that because at around the two hour mark, someone sat down next to me. 

“Hi!” 

I flinched, cursing at myself for not paying enough attention to my surroundings. But, when I finally dared to look I finally allowed myself to feel *some* relief at the fact that the person sitting next to me wasn’t that particular vampire. Or any vampire at all. It was Roger, the cook from the diner, and possible unconfirmed werewolf.

I tensed up for a second, but I still sat back down next to him. 

“Hi,” I muttered, picking at the skin around my fingernails.  

We sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes before he decided to speak. “Waiting for the bus?” He teased, but I didn’t respond. What if they were all in on it?

“How did you find me?” I asked instead. 

He laughed a little bit, slightly amused. “It wasn’t hard. You’re the only human here,” he teased, bumping my shoulder lightly. “I was just walking to my shift at the diner and saw you sitting here by yourself,” he continued after I didn’t say anything to his comment from before. 

I nodded, choosing to ignore the fact that I was the only human in a town full of monsters. Which probably meant that my every move was noticed by everybody else. 

“Come on, let me buy you a drink at the diner. You must be cold.”

“No, thank you,” I replied, staring at the end of the road, praying that the bus would make its appearance. 

“You’re still waiting for that bus?” He nagged, but I just nodded. “Well, you’re going to be waiting a while—” he smirked, not maliciously but in amusement—“last night’s storm trashed the road. No buses in or out the town.”

“What?!” I whipped my head around so fast that my neck hurt a bit. 

“Yes. It’s pretty common,” he explained. “Nobody really cares much for this stretch of road, and it typically stays like this for months.”

“No, but—”

“You don’t have to believe me,” he shrugged. “You can stay here indefinitely. But there’s another storm coming, and you’ll be much more comfortable at the diner. ” He didn’t even wait to see if I decided to follow. He just started walking toward the diner, more than likely already running late because of me. 

My brain was still reeling from the news that I was essentially trapped here until the road was fixed, but I still ran to catch up with Roger anyway. Because, what else could I really do?

The diner didn’t look much different in the daylight. The only noticeable change was that a different woman stood at the counter taking orders. I hadn’t seen her before, but she nodded when she saw me, as if she already knew me.

I returned the nod and sat at an empty booth, my stomach rumbling with hunger. 

It didn’t take long for Roger to appear from behind the kitchen doors with a plate of eggs and bacon and a big mug in hand. Without a word, he placed both objects in front of me and he sat on the opposite side. 

I wanted to complain, to tell him that I hadn’t ordered anything, but the hunger won and I began eating my breakfast. 

I eyed the coffee cup distrustingly, though, as it was the same type used for blood, but I relaxed when the familiar scent of coffee hit my nostrils. 

I wrapped my hands around the warm ceramic, but did’t say anything for a few minutes, content to be in silence with Roger by my side. 

“So… I’m stuck here?” I finally asked, awkwardly. 

“If it’s of any consolation, we’re all stuck here.”

“It’s REALLY not,” I replied, half joking and half serious. 

The bell above the door rang, and I shot my head toward it, and then I found myself relaxing when it wasn’t… him.

“So…you’re all monsters?” I asked, the last part mostly a hushed whisper. 

“Monsters?” He pressed a hand to his chest, and for a moment I was terrified that I’d actually offended him. “How dare y—” he stopped when he noticed my genuine look of worry. “Sorry, sorry. I was kidding. But you should’ve seen the look on you face,” he laughed. “Yes, we’re all monsters, as you put it. Although we do prefer the term inhuman.”

I nodded, suddenly very interested in the coffee mug. I asked a question I wasn’t ready to have answered, and he answered it. That was on me. 

“And what are you?” I asked before realizing that I was doing it. My eyes widened with surprise at the fact that I’d actually said it out loud. 

He laughed. “What do you think I am?” He teased. 

“Right now? An asshole.” What was wrong with me? Did I want to get killed? I instantly stiffened, slamming my hands on my mouth. “I’m sorry! I—”

He burst out laughing. “Fair enough,” he shrugged. “I’m a werewolf.”

I nodded again, but I wasn’t surprised. At least my theory had been confirmed. 

“So, what do you say? Are you coming in for the night shift tonight?” He asked after a moment of silence, smiling in his usual friendly manner. 

“Um—” I shuffled nervously.

“You don’t have to decide right now. But I do have to go to work. Maybe I’ll see you there.” And with that, he left me alone to finish eating my breakfast. 

Later, I made my way back to the motel. After getting confirmation that the bus wasn’t coming, I reluctantly handed the man at the counter the $400 that had cost me literal blood, sweat, and tears in exchange for another week in the motel from hell. And just like that, I was back down to $550.

So, my options were clear: sleep in the streets of a town full of monsters, or work at the diner. Obviously, option number two was the only sound one. 

At seven I began getting ready for my shift, planning to grab a quick meal before it started. 

I put on the faded pink dress and I was just putting on that ridiculous hat when the lights flickered. 

I paused for a moment, but ultimately continued giving myself a pep talk, preparing for another night at the diner. Surrounded by monsters. And maybe even… him. I was grateful that I hadn’t seen him since the previous week, but I knew that I would have to see him again. 

Then the lights flickered again, and again after a few more seconds. And then, finally, the last flicker erupted into a spark, and the entire room was swallowed by darkness.

Through the blinds, the last rays of the setting sun illuminated the wall. The plaster suddenly bulged, molding itself into the shape of a woman’s face, pressed from the inside, like the shape of a baby’s hand on its mother’s belly. A screeching sound went through the wall as the woman tried to tear through it with her hands.

I bolted from the room, only to find other guests doing the same. There were five of us, all stumbling in the dark. A boy, not much older than me, slid out of his room screaming.

Then the man who owned the motel appeared, coming out from behind the booth for the first time since I’d gotten there. The appearance of his legs gave me some pause, as they were goat legs instead of human ones, but I told myself that there were bigger issues to worry about than a—satyr?. 

“Everybody to the diner! Now!” He screamed. We all scurried there, and the place became crowded quickly, as all the other houses on the block were also succumbed in darkness. 

“Everybody calm down!” Linda shouted, trying to quiet the screaming crowd. “We can’t do anything until you are calm!”

Behind the counter, Roger was doing his best to keep a few furious customers from forcing their way into the back.

More people kept pouring in. The diner was quickly becoming even more packed, and it was obvious why. It was the only place in sight that still had power. The room was in utter disarray. 

The man leading the people trying to get to the back raised his arm in attempt to punch Roger, and I acted out of instinct. I jumped up on the counter and just yelled.

“Enough!” 

Somehow, it actually worked. The noise died instantly, and every head turned toward me.

My stomach twisted, and I was suddenly feeling self-conscious, but I couldn’t back down now. Not even from the shudder that went down my spine when I saw one vampire flashing his fangs at me. “You all need to be calm so that we can fix this,” I continued Linda’s words. 

Roger took advantage of my intervention, shoving the guy backward and slamming down the metal gate that separated the dining area from the the back. Then he grabbed me by the waist, lifted me off the counter, and set me back on the floor with a grin that was half amusement and half pride.

“I knew you would come,” he winked at me. 

On the other side, Linda was smiling at me too. 

“Thank you, Susan,” she said before turning to the crowd. “Now—” she looked at the people angrily—“I know that we all want to deal with the lady in the walls, but as I said before, our iron rod is still in place. It must have been the one at the motel.” She explained. 

“The lady in the walls?” I whispered to Roger. 

“I’ll tell you later,” he muttered back.

“That can’t be right,” a woman said stepping forward in anger. “That rod hasn’t moved in since it was placed. Every time this happens, it’s the one here that fails! Do you really expect us to believe your lies?”

“Why would I lie, dear?” Linda’s voice turned malicious, and for a second I stiffened as if the anger were directed at me. “Our iron rod is perfectly fine, and we have never had a reason to lie about it in the past. So watch your mouth.” 

The small woman opened her mouth to protest, but one look from Linda made her retreat back into the crowd.

“The lady in the walls?” I asked Roger again, this time through gutted teeth. 

He sighed, and while Linda was still dealing with complaints and questions, he grabbed me gently by the arm and led me into the kitchen, closing the doors behind us.

I just stared at him waiting for an explanation. 

“Yes. The lady in the walls.” He scratched the back of his head. “About a century ago, when the town got its electric grid and the diner was built, a bunch of us started to come here. When my grandmother was young, this used to be a normal human town. But when she came here through the electricity, the humans started to go missing. Eventually, they were all taken by her or they fled. We thought we were safe because she hadn’t targeted us yet. But when she ran out of humans to consume she turned to us.”

“Consume?” I asked.

“She pulls them into the walls with her. Nobody knows what happens with the victims,” he explained. “All it takes is a touch.”

A wave of nausea washed over me, followed by a dizzying realization. I had been inches from that wall. If I had been slower, if I had frozen… I would have been consumed. The word itself felt foul. Consumed.

“Ok, ok…” I said, fidgeting with my fingers and trying to calm my racing mind. “What about the iron rods?”

“We had to place them into the walls,” he explained. “One here, because the diner is that lured her in, and another one at the motel, because it’s the first place that got electricity in town. And since iron is like poison to us, we use it to keep her away. But both rods need to be in perfect condition for that to work. And sometimes they move, or corrode. Or maybe the storm caused more damage than we initially thought it did.”

I shuddered, but nodded. 

We both walked back out of the kitchen, where Linda was still arguing with the crowd. 

“Fine,” The satyr from the motel barked. “Let’s say it is the motel’s rod this time. What do we do, huh? The roads are closed. No one’s coming in or out.”

Another voice added, “ Eugene is right! And who’s gonna fix it? We can’t touch the damn thing.”

Before Linda could respond to the panicked woman, a broad-shouldered man stepped forward.  

“I have an idea,” he said, staring straight at me. For a second, I could’ve sworn his eyes turned yellowish. “She can do it.” He pointed right at me, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. And looking back… I guess it kind of was, wasn’t it?

All eyes turned to me again, and I froze. 

“Oh no. No, no, no, no, no,” I whispered, stepping back. My stomach did a weird flip.

Roger’s hand grabbed my arm. “Don’t worry, you won’t have to do anything you don’t want,” he whispered. 

“She’s human,” the man said, raising his voice. “So she can touch the rod. Turn her over right now, boy.”

“Let’s be sensible. The girl wouldn’t even know what to do. And I’m not endangering anymore of my staff,” Linda exposed. 

“She has to!” someone shouted.

“She’s the only one who can!” another added.

“Let’s see how she likes not doing it!” someone else snarled from the back.

The diner erupted into chaos while Linda and Roger were trying to defend me. I was panicking, everybody else was panicking.

And, before I could even process what I was doing, I said it. 

“I’ll do it,” my voice barely over a whisper

Oh no. What did I just do?

I hoped for a second that they hadn’t heard me. But of course they had, because they all got dead quiet before suddenly erupted into cheers. 

My mouth was dry, my brain was blank, and my heart was somewhere in my throat.

Roger’s hand was suddenly on my shoulder. “Come on,” he muttered, steering me toward the back. 

“I didn’t… I mean, I don’t” I tried to explain, but my brain was short-circuiting. My mouth had just done that thing where it acted before I’d given it permission. “I just said it because—I—I don’t even know why I said it!”

“Because you’re scared,” Roger said trying to calm me. “And people do dumb things when they’re scared.”

“I have to do it now,” I said automatically, panic bubbling back up.

“No, you don’t,” he said firmly. “This isn’t on you.”

“I said I would,” I argued, though even as I said it, my voice shook. “Doesn’t that mean I have to?”

He gave me a long look, then sighed and smiled sympathetically.

“Hey. You can do this. It’s not hard,” he said, tone steady enough to make me almost believe him. “Just stay away from the walls, and you’ll be fine. I promise.”

I nodded, though my legs felt like jelly.

“I was going to suggest it myself, really. But I was scared you were going to punch me,” he joked, and I let out a little laugh too. 

Before I could say anything else, the kitchen doors opened and Linda stepped in.

She looked straight at me and, to my horror, she smiled. “I’m proud of you, darling.”

She hugged me and I was speechless. Proud?

Linda turned her attention to Roger this time. “Make sure she knows what to do. I’ll be gone soon.”

Roger nodded. 

“You’re leaving?” I asked. 

“Yes, dear. It’s almost eight.”

 Right. She can’t be here after eight. 

""I need to tell Martha what to handle while you and Roger sort this out. Don’t worry about anything else.”

I nodded again, assuming that Martha was the waitress I saw in the morning (It was.)

After Linda left, Roger and I went into the supply closet, where he pulled out a worn briefcase out of a box on the top shelf. 

I wanted to open it to see what was inside, but he stopped me because even being close to the replacement rod could end up draining him. 

Then, Roger brought Eugene, the owner of the motel, to the back because we needed his help to get in. 

“Over my dead body am I going in there before that nut job in the walls is gone!” The satyr exclaimed. 

“That can be arranged,” retorted Roger. 

“I’d like to see you try, wolf boy.”

Some more choice words were exchanged between the two, but for the sake of brevity, let’s just say that he was less than helpful. 

Thankfully, Roger knew Lucas, a fellow werewolf and his best friend. But most importantly, he had worked at the motel for a few years and knew the layout like the back of his hand. 

The three of us made our way to the motel. The screeching could be heard all the way from the outside, and it made me shiver.

I froze for a second, but I forced myself to keep moving.  

“I’ll stay outside,” Roger offered. “I’ll move through the rooms to call her to me. To distract her from you.”

Lucas hesitated, but ultimately nodded. 

“It’s a good plan,” he admitted. “But be careful.”

We went through the front desk and Lucas led us through a narrow corridor all the way to the boiler room. 

The hallway was so tight that he accidentally brushed his shoulder against the wall when he tried to get past me. Instantly, the face of the lady in the walls bulged from beneath the plaster. 

“Move!” I shouted, grabbing his arm. I yanked him toward the center of the hall, but the space was so small she almost brushed his shoulder. I pulled harder, and we ran, sprinting until the screeches faded. I couldn’t help but wonder if Roger was ok. 

But the lady was smarter than we thought, as she moved down the hallway and extended her clawed hand through the wall, blocking our path. Her other arm also came through, followed by her screeching face. Her eye sockets locked with my eyes and, taking advantage of my fear, she managed to brush the edge of my dress. 

I stood deathly still, prepared to be transported wherever it was that she took her victims, but Lucas tackled me to the ground just in time. 

I managed to get up with his help and we made the last sprint to the boiler room. 

We slammed through the boiler room door, relieved that the satyr hadn’t bothered to lock it, and we finally allowed ourselves some respite and time to breath. 

“Here—” he handed me a key—“the iron rod is inside that little panel behind the boiler. I can’t go any further or it’ll hurt, but I’ll try to distract her while you’re close to the wall.” 

I forced myself to ignore the rational side of my brain that screamed danger, and made my mind blank. If I thought too much I ran into the possibility of giving up and running in the other direction. 

I swallowed hard and stepped forward. 

My hands trembled as I inserted the key into the keyhole. Just as I twisted the key, I had to immediately jump back because a hand shot out of the wall, clawing at the air. 

I bumped my head on the boiler, but luckily my hair protected it from the burn. 

“Hey!” Lucas shouted, slamming his palm against the wall to draw her away. It worked, and she left me alone to do my work. 

I took a deep breath and slowly opened the panel, not sure about what I would find inside. I hoped it would be a dislodged rod so that I wouldn’t have to waste time by getting the new one out. But I was fully prepared to find a corroded one instead. 

However, when I finally opened the panel, the spot was empty. 

There was no other rod.

I didn’t allow myself any time to process that information or ponder the implications and I just opened the briefcase quickly. I got distracted for a second when Lucas screamed behind me. I turned, panic coursing through me, but he just flashed me smile, so I went back to work. 

Thankfully, I turned around just in time because the lady in the walls shot for me next, but I just swung the iron rod from the briefcase at her and she instantly disappeared. 

Lucas screamed again, but I didn’t bother look back, too focused on the finish line. I shoved the rod into its slot, twisting until I felt it click.

Finally, light flooded the room.

I exhaled shakily, looking over my shoulder in triumph to Lucas. 

But there was no Lucas. 

He was gone.

The room was empty and I was alone. 

I entered into a state of shock, just staring at the spot where I’d last seen him when Roger burst through the door, breathless. “You did it!” he said, grabbing me into a hug before I could even speak. “You did it, you’re amazing!”

I made an attempt to shove him off me, but my hands felt pathetically weak. Still, he retreated, and his eyes followed mine’s direction. Then he looked around the room and then back at me. 

“Where’s Lucas?” He asked, tearing up. Because he already knew the answer better than I did. 

I tried to apologize, but he told me that he knew that it wasn’t my fault. He knew how stubborn he was. There was nothing I could’ve done. He knew that. 

I still blame myself, though. 

We just walked out of the motel in silence and back to the diner. 

The rest of the night blurred into a haze. I can’t remember exactly what happened, mostly because I was too exhausted and dazed to be able to recall. 

I just remember that after dawn came, I collapsed into bed. 

So yes, I went back to the diner. And I’ll keep going back. 

Because, for now, I’m trapped here. 

At least, it help me feel safer that everybody seems to think of me as some sort of town hero, despite not feeling like much of a hero myself. 

And, to make matters worse, I burnt my hand on the boiler sometime during the whole ordeal, and I can barely use it properly at my job. 

Oh, I almost forgot. 

Yesterday, I finally told Linda and Roger about the missing original rod. They asked me not to mention it to anyone else until they figure out what happened. But I figure it’s fine to tell you, since none of you even know where this town is.

Because if I’m going to have to stay here, I need to make sure it’s safe. For both my sake and everybody else’s. 

I feel like I owe them that much, after Lucas died helping me.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Maybe that way, one day I’ll stop feeling this guilt. ",5,1760533482.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

please comment on reddit  
**Do I need to vacuum the carpet before you arrive?**

I thinks this is the most Frequently Asked Question – No, you don’t need to vacuum your carpet beforehand. We use a powerful vacuum with a brush attachment to extract dry soil and pet hair. Dry vacuuming is part of our initial cleaning process. [Find out more](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/should-you-vacuum-before-professional-carpet-cleaning/).

**Do I need to move the furniture prior to carpet cleaning?**

We can move lightweight furniture for you. However, larger and heavier items, such as bookcases and wardrobes, especially those of high value, should not be moved. We will clean around these items to ensure every area receives attention.

**How often should I have my carpets cleaned?**

The frequency of cleaning depends on several factors, such as the number of people, pets, smokers, and children in the household. On average, you should clean carpets every six months. If you don’t have pets, smokers, or children, an annual cleaning may be sufficient. [Find out more](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/how-often-should-you-clean-your-carpets-expert-advice/).

**How long does it take for my carpets to dry?**

Drying time depends on the type of carpet fibre and the environment. Wool carpets may take longer to dry, but proper air circulation can expedite the process. You can walk on your carpet after cleaning; however, it will remain damp for 3-4 hours. [Find how we dry carpet and upholstery](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/fast-drying-after-carpet-cleaning/).

**Does carpet cleaning help with allergies and asthma?**

While regular vacuuming reduces surface dust, it does not remove deeply embedded particles that can trigger allergy symptoms. Professional carpet cleaning helps prevent allergies and asthma, providing a healthier home environment. [Find out more](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/why-is-carpet-cleaning-essential-for-allergy-prevention/).

**What are the best carpets for cleaning?**

The best carpets for cleaning come from durable, stain-resistant materials like nylon, polyester, triexta, and olefin. Wool offers natural benefits but requires more care. Selecting the right material and pile type ensures your carpet looks great and is easy to maintain with regular cleaning. [Check our list of the best carpets for cleaning](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/what-are-the-best-carpets-for-cleaning/).

**Is it worth getting carpets cleaned?**

Yes, professional carpet cleaning is worth it. It improves the appearance of your carpets, extends their lifespan, enhances indoor air quality, and promotes a healthier home. It’s a smart investment for both cleanliness and long-term carpet care. [Find out more](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/is-it-worth-getting-carpets-cleaned/).

**Can steam cleaning damage my carpet?**

No, steam cleaning (hot water extraction) is the safest and most effective method for removing embedded soil and contaminants. Leading carpet manufacturers recommend this method.

**Can pet odours and urine be removed?**

Yes, we use professional-grade chemicals, including enzyme cleaners, and specialized equipment, such as the water claw, to effectively remove pet urine and odours.

**Are you insured?**

Yes, we carry public liability insurance for your peace of mind.

**What are your prices?**

This is the most common FAQ. Our pricing offers excellent value for money. The cost depends on the number of rooms or pieces of upholstery you want cleaned, as well as the severity of any stains (e.g., coffee, wine, makeup, pet urine). Cleaning more areas in one visit makes it more cost-effective. [Find out more about the cost](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/price-list/).

**Do you clean sofas?**

Yes, we also clean [upholstery](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/upholstery-and-car-interiors-cleaning/), including sofas and [mattresses](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/mattres-cleaning-services/).

**How do you accept payments?**

We accept payments via cash or bank transfer, and we will provide an invoice or receipt for your records.

**This is the most important FAQ: DIY Carpet Cleaning vs. Professional Services: Which Is Better?**

**Choose DIY Carpet Cleaning If:**  
You need a quick refresh or light cleaning  
You’re dealing with minor dirt and stains  
You enjoy cleaning and don’t mind putting in the effort  
You are okay with the risk of potentially damaging your carpet  
**Choose Professional Carpet Cleaning If:**  
Looking for deep cleaning for allergens, bacteria, and tough stains  
You want to extend the life of your carpets and protect your investment  
You prefer a hassle-free, time-saving solution [Find out more in my post.](https://www.carpetprocleaning.co.uk/diy-carpet-cleaning-vs-professional-services-which-is-better/)

**What Cleaning Chemicals Do You Use?**

This is my favourite FAQ as I love to chat about the carpet cleaning chemicals. We use around 36 different professional-grade chemicals, each specially formulated to provide superior cleaning power.

I went back to the diner. 

Some of your comments got to me, and they made me realize that the best decision a mature and responsible woman would make is to see the debt to the rude vampire through. Because that is the right thing to do. 

Ok, no. I’m lying. 

Sunday morning came like a beacon in the dark. I woke up early and paced through my room for a few hours before gathering the courage to actually walk through the door. I hadn’t left my room in days, and even Roger had given up on trying to talk to me. He wasn’t even bringing food by anymore. 

But that day I had to leave. The bus that only came on Sundays was my only escape route from this town, and I was going to make it out. No matter what. 

I packed everything I owned into my back pack, and I left the uniform with which I had left the diner in a hurry last week neatly folded on the bed before leaving the room. (On a completely separate note, I really want to know what this is made out of. It didn’t tear with all of the… you know, and the blood stains washed right out of it). I didn’t even check out. That’s how desperate I was for this to go well. 

I walked quickly to the bus station, flinching at every shadow and at every noise. I’m a little bit embarrassed to admit that I even let out a tiny scream when a pigeon flew by me, but you all have to understand that I was terrified out of my mind. I didn’t know much about… anything at all really. I only knew that a crazy vampire who sucked so much of my blood that I passed out and claimed that I owed his some sort of life debt was running around loose in the town where I was staying. I couldn’t afford to let him get to me. Not even after he saved my life. 

So yes, I admit it. Despite the warnings and despite knowing deep down that leaving wasn’t the best idea I’ve ever had, I still did it. 

Tried to, at least. 

The bus was running late. I knew that that wasn’t uncommon for small towns, so I still waited. I waited for an hour. And then two. I tried to blend in with my surroundings, I didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention to myself. But it didn’t really work out like that because at around the two hour mark, someone sat down next to me. 

“Hi!” 

I flinched, cursing at myself for not paying enough attention to my surroundings. But, when I finally dared to look I finally allowed myself to feel *some* relief at the fact that the person sitting next to me wasn’t that particular vampire. Or any vampire at all. It was Roger, the cook from the diner, and possible unconfirmed werewolf.

I tensed up for a second, but I still sat back down next to him. 

“Hi,” I muttered, picking at the skin around my fingernails.  

We sat in an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes before he decided to speak. “Waiting for the bus?” He teased, but I didn’t respond. What if they were all in on it?

“How did you find me?” I asked instead. 

He laughed a little bit, slightly amused. “It wasn’t hard. You’re the only human here,” he teased, bumping my shoulder lightly. “I was just walking to my shift at the diner and saw you sitting here by yourself,” he continued after I didn’t say anything to his comment from before. 

I nodded, choosing to ignore the fact that I was the only human in a town full of monsters. Which probably meant that my every move was noticed by everybody else. 

“Come on, let me buy you a drink at the diner. You must be cold.”

“No, thank you,” I replied, staring at the end of the road, praying that the bus would make its appearance. 

“You’re still waiting for that bus?” He nagged, but I just nodded. “Well, you’re going to be waiting a while—” he smirked, not maliciously but in amusement—“last night’s storm trashed the road. No buses in or out the town.”

“What?!” I whipped my head around so fast that my neck hurt a bit. 

“Yes. It’s pretty common,” he explained. “Nobody really cares much for this stretch of road, and it typically stays like this for months.”

“No, but—”

“You don’t have to believe me,” he shrugged. “You can stay here indefinitely. But there’s another storm coming, and you’ll be much more comfortable at the diner. ” He didn’t even wait to see if I decided to follow. He just started walking toward the diner, more than likely already running late because of me. 

My brain was still reeling from the news that I was essentially trapped here until the road was fixed, but I still ran to catch up with Roger anyway. Because, what else could I really do?

The diner didn’t look much different in the daylight. The only noticeable change was that a different woman stood at the counter taking orders. I hadn’t seen her before, but she nodded when she saw me, as if she already knew me.

I returned the nod and sat at an empty booth, my stomach rumbling with hunger. 

It didn’t take long for Roger to appear from behind the kitchen doors with a plate of eggs and bacon and a big mug in hand. Without a word, he placed both objects in front of me and he sat on the opposite side. 

I wanted to complain, to tell him that I hadn’t ordered anything, but the hunger won and I began eating my breakfast. 

I eyed the coffee cup distrustingly, though, as it was the same type used for blood, but I relaxed when the familiar scent of coffee hit my nostrils. 

I wrapped my hands around the warm ceramic, but did’t say anything for a few minutes, content to be in silence with Roger by my side. 

“So… I’m stuck here?” I finally asked, awkwardly. 

“If it’s of any consolation, we’re all stuck here.”

“It’s REALLY not,” I replied, half joking and half serious. 

The bell above the door rang, and I shot my head toward it, and then I found myself relaxing when it wasn’t… him.

“So…you’re all monsters?” I asked, the last part mostly a hushed whisper. 

“Monsters?” He pressed a hand to his chest, and for a moment I was terrified that I’d actually offended him. “How dare y—” he stopped when he noticed my genuine look of worry. “Sorry, sorry. I was kidding. But you should’ve seen the look on you face,” he laughed. “Yes, we’re all monsters, as you put it. Although we do prefer the term inhuman.”

I nodded, suddenly very interested in the coffee mug. I asked a question I wasn’t ready to have answered, and he answered it. That was on me. 

“And what are you?” I asked before realizing that I was doing it. My eyes widened with surprise at the fact that I’d actually said it out loud. 

He laughed. “What do you think I am?” He teased. 

“Right now? An asshole.” What was wrong with me? Did I want to get killed? I instantly stiffened, slamming my hands on my mouth. “I’m sorry! I—”

He burst out laughing. “Fair enough,” he shrugged. “I’m a werewolf.”

I nodded again, but I wasn’t surprised. At least my theory had been confirmed. 

“So, what do you say? Are you coming in for the night shift tonight?” He asked after a moment of silence, smiling in his usual friendly manner. 

“Um—” I shuffled nervously.

“You don’t have to decide right now. But I do have to go to work. Maybe I’ll see you there.” And with that, he left me alone to finish eating my breakfast. 

Later, I made my way back to the motel. After getting confirmation that the bus wasn’t coming, I reluctantly handed the man at the counter the $400 that had cost me literal blood, sweat, and tears in exchange for another week in the motel from hell. And just like that, I was back down to $550.

So, my options were clear: sleep in the streets of a town full of monsters, or work at the diner. Obviously, option number two was the only sound one. 

At seven I began getting ready for my shift, planning to grab a quick meal before it started. 

I put on the faded pink dress and I was just putting on that ridiculous hat when the lights flickered. 

I paused for a moment, but ultimately continued giving myself a pep talk, preparing for another night at the diner. Surrounded by monsters. And maybe even… him. I was grateful that I hadn’t seen him since the previous week, but I knew that I would have to see him again. 

Then the lights flickered again, and again after a few more seconds. And then, finally, the last flicker erupted into a spark, and the entire room was swallowed by darkness.

Through the blinds, the last rays of the setting sun illuminated the wall. The plaster suddenly bulged, molding itself into the shape of a woman’s face, pressed from the inside, like the shape of a baby’s hand on its mother’s belly. A screeching sound went through the wall as the woman tried to tear through it with her hands.

I bolted from the room, only to find other guests doing the same. There were five of us, all stumbling in the dark. A boy, not much older than me, slid out of his room screaming.

Then the man who owned the motel appeared, coming out from behind the booth for the first time since I’d gotten there. The appearance of his legs gave me some pause, as they were goat legs instead of human ones, but I told myself that there were bigger issues to worry about than a—satyr?. 

“Everybody to the diner! Now!” He screamed. We all scurried there, and the place became crowded quickly, as all the other houses on the block were also succumbed in darkness. 

“Everybody calm down!” Linda shouted, trying to quiet the screaming crowd. “We can’t do anything until you are calm!”

Behind the counter, Roger was doing his best to keep a few furious customers from forcing their way into the back.

More people kept pouring in. The diner was quickly becoming even more packed, and it was obvious why. It was the only place in sight that still had power. The room was in utter disarray. 

The man leading the people trying to get to the back raised his arm in attempt to punch Roger, and I acted out of instinct. I jumped up on the counter and just yelled.

“Enough!” 

Somehow, it actually worked. The noise died instantly, and every head turned toward me.

My stomach twisted, and I was suddenly feeling self-conscious, but I couldn’t back down now. Not even from the shudder that went down my spine when I saw one vampire flashing his fangs at me. “You all need to be calm so that we can fix this,” I continued Linda’s words. 

Roger took advantage of my intervention, shoving the guy backward and slamming down the metal gate that separated the dining area from the the back. Then he grabbed me by the waist, lifted me off the counter, and set me back on the floor with a grin that was half amusement and half pride.

“I knew you would come,” he winked at me. 

On the other side, Linda was smiling at me too. 

“Thank you, Susan,” she said before turning to the crowd. “Now—” she looked at the people angrily—“I know that we all want to deal with the lady in the walls, but as I said before, our iron rod is still in place. It must have been the one at the motel.” She explained. 

“The lady in the walls?” I whispered to Roger. 

“I’ll tell you later,” he muttered back.

“That can’t be right,” a woman said stepping forward in anger. “That rod hasn’t moved in since it was placed. Every time this happens, it’s the one here that fails! Do you really expect us to believe your lies?”

“Why would I lie, dear?” Linda’s voice turned malicious, and for a second I stiffened as if the anger were directed at me. “Our iron rod is perfectly fine, and we have never had a reason to lie about it in the past. So watch your mouth.” 

The small woman opened her mouth to protest, but one look from Linda made her retreat back into the crowd.

“The lady in the walls?” I asked Roger again, this time through gutted teeth. 

He sighed, and while Linda was still dealing with complaints and questions, he grabbed me gently by the arm and led me into the kitchen, closing the doors behind us.

I just stared at him waiting for an explanation. 

“Yes. The lady in the walls.” He scratched the back of his head. “About a century ago, when the town got its electric grid and the diner was built, a bunch of us started to come here. When my grandmother was young, this used to be a normal human town. But when she came here through the electricity, the humans started to go missing. Eventually, they were all taken by her or they fled. We thought we were safe because she hadn’t targeted us yet. But when she ran out of humans to consume she turned to us.”

“Consume?” I asked.

“She pulls them into the walls with her. Nobody knows what happens with the victims,” he explained. “All it takes is a touch.”

A wave of nausea washed over me, followed by a dizzying realization. I had been inches from that wall. If I had been slower, if I had frozen… I would have been consumed. The word itself felt foul. Consumed.

“Ok, ok…” I said, fidgeting with my fingers and trying to calm my racing mind. “What about the iron rods?”

“We had to place them into the walls,” he explained. “One here, because the diner is that lured her in, and another one at the motel, because it’s the first place that got electricity in town. And since iron is like poison to us, we use it to keep her away. But both rods need to be in perfect condition for that to work. And sometimes they move, or corrode. Or maybe the storm caused more damage than we initially thought it did.”

I shuddered, but nodded. 

We both walked back out of the kitchen, where Linda was still arguing with the crowd. 

“Fine,” The satyr from the motel barked. “Let’s say it is the motel’s rod this time. What do we do, huh? The roads are closed. No one’s coming in or out.”

Another voice added, “ Eugene is right! And who’s gonna fix it? We can’t touch the damn thing.”

Before Linda could respond to the panicked woman, a broad-shouldered man stepped forward.  

“I have an idea,” he said, staring straight at me. For a second, I could’ve sworn his eyes turned yellowish. “She can do it.” He pointed right at me, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. And looking back… I guess it kind of was, wasn’t it?

All eyes turned to me again, and I froze. 

“Oh no. No, no, no, no, no,” I whispered, stepping back. My stomach did a weird flip.

Roger’s hand grabbed my arm. “Don’t worry, you won’t have to do anything you don’t want,” he whispered. 

“She’s human,” the man said, raising his voice. “So she can touch the rod. Turn her over right now, boy.”

“Let’s be sensible. The girl wouldn’t even know what to do. And I’m not endangering anymore of my staff,” Linda exposed. 

“She has to!” someone shouted.

“She’s the only one who can!” another added.

“Let’s see how she likes not doing it!” someone else snarled from the back.

The diner erupted into chaos while Linda and Roger were trying to defend me. I was panicking, everybody else was panicking.

And, before I could even process what I was doing, I said it. 

“I’ll do it,” my voice barely over a whisper

Oh no. What did I just do?

I hoped for a second that they hadn’t heard me. But of course they had, because they all got dead quiet before suddenly erupted into cheers. 

My mouth was dry, my brain was blank, and my heart was somewhere in my throat.

Roger’s hand was suddenly on my shoulder. “Come on,” he muttered, steering me toward the back. 

“I didn’t… I mean, I don’t” I tried to explain, but my brain was short-circuiting. My mouth had just done that thing where it acted before I’d given it permission. “I just said it because—I—I don’t even know why I said it!”

“Because you’re scared,” Roger said trying to calm me. “And people do dumb things when they’re scared.”

“I have to do it now,” I said automatically, panic bubbling back up.

“No, you don’t,” he said firmly. “This isn’t on you.”

“I said I would,” I argued, though even as I said it, my voice shook. “Doesn’t that mean I have to?”

He gave me a long look, then sighed and smiled sympathetically.

“Hey. You can do this. It’s not hard,” he said, tone steady enough to make me almost believe him. “Just stay away from the walls, and you’ll be fine. I promise.”

I nodded, though my legs felt like jelly.

“I was going to suggest it myself, really. But I was scared you were going to punch me,” he joked, and I let out a little laugh too. 

Before I could say anything else, the kitchen doors opened and Linda stepped in.

She looked straight at me and, to my horror, she smiled. “I’m proud of you, darling.”

She hugged me and I was speechless. Proud?

Linda turned her attention to Roger this time. “Make sure she knows what to do. I’ll be gone soon.”

Roger nodded. 

“You’re leaving?” I asked. 

“Yes, dear. It’s almost eight.”

 Right. She can’t be here after eight. 

""I need to tell Martha what to handle while you and Roger sort this out. Don’t worry about anything else.”

I nodded again, assuming that Martha was the waitress I saw in the morning (It was.)

After Linda left, Roger and I went into the supply closet, where he pulled out a worn briefcase out of a box on the top shelf. 

I wanted to open it to see what was inside, but he stopped me because even being close to the replacement rod could end up draining him. 

Then, Roger brought Eugene, the owner of the motel, to the back because we needed his help to get in. 

“Over my dead body am I going in there before that nut job in the walls is gone!” The satyr exclaimed. 

“That can be arranged,” retorted Roger. 

“I’d like to see you try, wolf boy.”

Some more choice words were exchanged between the two, but for the sake of brevity, let’s just say that he was less than helpful. 

Thankfully, Roger knew Lucas, a fellow werewolf and his best friend. But most importantly, he had worked at the motel for a few years and knew the layout like the back of his hand. 

The three of us made our way to the motel. The screeching could be heard all the way from the outside, and it made me shiver.

I froze for a second, but I forced myself to keep moving.  

“I’ll stay outside,” Roger offered. “I’ll move through the rooms to call her to me. To distract her from you.”

Lucas hesitated, but ultimately nodded. 

“It’s a good plan,” he admitted. “But be careful.”

We went through the front desk and Lucas led us through a narrow corridor all the way to the boiler room. 

The hallway was so tight that he accidentally brushed his shoulder against the wall when he tried to get past me. Instantly, the face of the lady in the walls bulged from beneath the plaster. 

“Move!” I shouted, grabbing his arm. I yanked him toward the center of the hall, but the space was so small she almost brushed his shoulder. I pulled harder, and we ran, sprinting until the screeches faded. I couldn’t help but wonder if Roger was ok. 

But the lady was smarter than we thought, as she moved down the hallway and extended her clawed hand through the wall, blocking our path. Her other arm also came through, followed by her screeching face. Her eye sockets locked with my eyes and, taking advantage of my fear, she managed to brush the edge of my dress. 

I stood deathly still, prepared to be transported wherever it was that she took her victims, but Lucas tackled me to the ground just in time. 

I managed to get up with his help and we made the last sprint to the boiler room. 

We slammed through the boiler room door, relieved that the satyr hadn’t bothered to lock it, and we finally allowed ourselves some respite and time to breath. 

“Here—” he handed me a key—“the iron rod is inside that little panel behind the boiler. I can’t go any further or it’ll hurt, but I’ll try to distract her while you’re close to the wall.” 

I forced myself to ignore the rational side of my brain that screamed danger, and made my mind blank. If I thought too much I ran into the possibility of giving up and running in the other direction. 

I swallowed hard and stepped forward. 

My hands trembled as I inserted the key into the keyhole. Just as I twisted the key, I had to immediately jump back because a hand shot out of the wall, clawing at the air. 

I bumped my head on the boiler, but luckily my hair protected it from the burn. 

“Hey!” Lucas shouted, slamming his palm against the wall to draw her away. It worked, and she left me alone to do my work. 

I took a deep breath and slowly opened the panel, not sure about what I would find inside. I hoped it would be a dislodged rod so that I wouldn’t have to waste time by getting the new one out. But I was fully prepared to find a corroded one instead. 

However, when I finally opened the panel, the spot was empty. 

There was no other rod.

I didn’t allow myself any time to process that information or ponder the implications and I just opened the briefcase quickly. I got distracted for a second when Lucas screamed behind me. I turned, panic coursing through me, but he just flashed me smile, so I went back to work. 

Thankfully, I turned around just in time because the lady in the walls shot for me next, but I just swung the iron rod from the briefcase at her and she instantly disappeared. 

Lucas screamed again, but I didn’t bother look back, too focused on the finish line. I shoved the rod into its slot, twisting until I felt it click.

Finally, light flooded the room.

I exhaled shakily, looking over my shoulder in triumph to Lucas. 

But there was no Lucas. 

He was gone.

The room was empty and I was alone. 

I entered into a state of shock, just staring at the spot where I’d last seen him when Roger burst through the door, breathless. “You did it!” he said, grabbing me into a hug before I could even speak. “You did it, you’re amazing!”

I made an attempt to shove him off me, but my hands felt pathetically weak. Still, he retreated, and his eyes followed mine’s direction. Then he looked around the room and then back at me. 

“Where’s Lucas?” He asked, tearing up. Because he already knew the answer better than I did. 

I tried to apologize, but he told me that he knew that it wasn’t my fault. He knew how stubborn he was. There was nothing I could’ve done. He knew that. 

I still blame myself, though. 

We just walked out of the motel in silence and back to the diner. 

The rest of the night blurred into a haze. I can’t remember exactly what happened, mostly because I was too exhausted and dazed to be able to recall. 

I just remember that after dawn came, I collapsed into bed. 

So yes, I went back to the diner. And I’ll keep going back. 

Because, for now, I’m trapped here. 

At least, it help me feel safer that everybody seems to think of me as some sort of town hero, despite not feeling like much of a hero myself. 

And, to make matters worse, I burnt my hand on the boiler sometime during the whole ordeal, and I can barely use it properly at my job. 

Oh, I almost forgot. 

Yesterday, I finally told Linda and Roger about the missing original rod. They asked me not to mention it to anyone else until they figure out what happened. But I figure it’s fine to tell you, since none of you even know where this town is.

Because if I’m going to have to stay here, I need to make sure it’s safe. For both my sake and everybody else’s. 

I feel like I owe them that much, after Lucas died helping me.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Maybe that way, one day I’ll stop feeling this guilt. ",14,1760533382.0,nosleep,4,1.0,False

1o7adl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1o7adl7/i_m24_am_appalled_at_myself_my_wife_f24_cried/,"I (M24) am appalled at myself: my wife (F24) cried this morning and it made me angry, and I don't know why?","Last night I called my stepmother to talk about my dad as I'm concerned for his health and mental well being. When I came to bed afterwards and explained what was discussed, my wife took that as as opportunity to bring up *her* concerns for *my* physical health. 

Basically, I've talked about wanting to get fit but haven't made the time to exercise. I was immediately put off as I believe I'm generally pretty healthy, I'm just wanting to slim down but haven't made it a priority (for context my wife and I are vegetarian, I have a soda maybe two or three days a week, I'm 6' 1"" and 235 lbs with no sign of gaining weight). My wife was expressing concern at my health, saying I haven't worked out at all, haven't gone to the doctor (I have back pain but I've had an X-Ray before and they said nothing is wrong and I don't want pain meds or a chiropractor because theyve messed me up before), and I haven't made time for my hobbies other than video games (I also write, draw, and am picking up guitar; I have a therapist-suggested hour each night for hobbies and have been mostly playing Marvel Rivals during that hour).

Like I said, I was immediately put off as, frankly, I think I should have the freedom to do these things in my own time. I don't NEED to work out other than for my own goals, and I don't NEED to go to the doctor because I already have before, and I don't NEED to spend my time doing anything in particular because that hour is my time and if all I wanna do is play video games then that's my prerogative. 

Needless to say, I said all of this to her, it became a bit of a fight as she was ""only concerned"" and ""just trying to encourage me."" I told her it didn’t feel encouraging, it felt like I was being told I wasn't taking care of myself and wasn't doing enough. I started to microsleep as it was well past when we usually go to bed, she got irritated at the (uncontrollable but understandably frustrating) microsleeping and the conversation ended unresolved. 

I felt like her concerns boiled down to things she shouldn't really be concerned with at all, as nothing is pressing in any way and it's my life my body and my time. 

Then this morning she DIDN'T TALK TO ME FOR AN HOUR. No goodmorning, no acknowledgement the two times I said something to her, she showered alone (we usually shower together) and came out past the bed still ignoring me. 

So I called her out for it, asked why she was upset and why she was ignoring me. I was upset and I made that known. She said she wasn't and was only trying to self-regulate and ""have a good morning."" I took that as I was somehow keeping her from having a good morning and told her its fine and to just get ready. 

Few minutes pass, I go to her in the kitchen and apologize for the morning. I jumped to conclusions and its okay for her to self regulate I completely understand. 

But I wasn't ready to give up on the night before; she brought it up and I thought that was a start to the night's conversation again. No need to repeat it, I said all the things I typed above once again, and she burst into tears and started crying about how mean I am and she just wanted a good morning and that there's no need to be hateful and be told everything that she's doing wrong and she'll mind her business and never bring anything up again. 

And I found myself looking at her cry and just feeling... angry. So frustrated, irritated, and exhausted. It was like all my patience and understanding and tolerance was gone. I simply couldn't stomach it. I tried to leave, that made her cry worse, so I sat on the floor to be as unintimidating as possible. I don't remember what was said after that, not much. Something about coffee and breakfast. She eventually started our morning coffee and left to isolate in the bathroom and I made breakfast. We were quiet after that, and she left without a word. 

Why on earth was I so angry at the tears? No the words, or the fight, or her behavior, but the *tears*. Why was that so upsetting, so frustrating? How can I look at my wife cry and feel that way? 

TL;DR - my wife and I had an argument at night and a misunderstanding in the morning, and when she started crying when we talked about it I was angry and put off. Help unpack my feelings. ",0,1760533318.0,relationship_advice,36,0.31,False

**Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too. Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.**

**TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 67**

Sometimes I don't realize that I gossiped about someone until the end of the day, when I take an inventory of the day's activities, and then, my gossiping appears like a blemish in my beautiful day. How could I have said something like that? Gossip shows its ugly head during a coffee break or lunch with business associates, or I may gossip during the evening, when I'm tired from the day's activities, and feel justified in bolstering my ego at the expense of someone else.

Character defects like gossip sneak into my life when I am not making a constant effort to work the Twelve Steps of recovery. I need to remind myself that my uniqueness is the blessing of my being, and that applies equally to everyone who crosses my path in life's journey. Today the only inventory I need to take is my own. I'll leave judgment of others to the Final Judge — Divine Providence.

1o7aah9,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o7aah9/the_missing_poster/,The Missing Poster,"

I’ve been a police officer for ten years. A few weeks ago, I found my niece’s face on a missing poster. The date on it was the day I found it.


I started my shift just like any other, with a cup of coffee.
Ten years on the job, caffeine’s basically part of the uniform.


Get to work.
Throw on my uniform.
Grab the keys to my sector car.
Get the coffee flowing through my veins as fast as possible.

My routine rarely strays. I stop at the same coffee shop five minutes from the precinct. They know my name. They know my order. I could walk in half asleep and still leave with exactly what I need.

While I waited at the counter, my eyes drifted over to the cork board near the door. The one layered with half torn flyers and yellowed business cards.

Landscapers looking for work.
A babysitter trying to pick up extra hours.
A dog walker for people too lazy or too busy to do it themselves.

Just as my name was called, something new caught my eye.

A missing poster.

I don’t remember ever seeing one there before. Maybe I never paid attention.

I grabbed my coffee and stepped toward the board. I took a closer look, tugging the paper free from the thumbtack.

The photo stopped me cold.

It wasn’t a blurry security image or a kid who looked kind of familiar.

It was my niece.

Her school photo.

The same one my sister keeps on the fridge. The same one I carry in my wallet.

Above the picture, bold black letters.

MISSING
Last seen:

The date written there was the same day I was standing in that coffee shop, holding it.



I didn’t have time to be confused.
My hands were already patting my pockets, searching for my phone.
When I realized it was still in the car, I ran, shoulder checking the door on my way out, nearly spilling someone’s latte as I pushed past.

No missed calls. No voicemails. No texts.
I hit my sister’s number.

No answer.
Tried again.
Nothing.

I kept calling the whole drive over. Each ring felt longer than the last.

I pulled up hard in front of her house, tires scraping against the curb.
My niece’s scooter was still on the porch from the night before, lying on its side.

I rang the bell, then knocked, then called her name.

The door flew open.
My sister stood there, hair wet, bathrobe disheveled, eyes wide like she’d just run from the shower.

For a second she just stared at me, confused, trying to place why I was there.
Then she saw the crumpled flyer in my hand.

The color drained from her face.

“What happened?” she whispered.



I stepped inside. She knew something was wrong before I said a word.

I held out the paper. “Look at this.”

Her eyes went wide. For a second she didn’t breathe.
“What the hell is this? She’s fine, she’s at school!”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes. I saw her get on the bus just like every morning.”

“Call the school,” I said. “Now.”

“You’re scaring me. Why wouldn’t she be there?”

“Just call.”

She grabbed her phone with shaking hands. I turned away, trying to keep my head clear.
I needed to radio this in, tell a supervisor, something.

There was no chance in hell I could finish my shift without knowing she was safe.

I walked into the kitchen, trying to gather my thoughts.
Mind racing.

The fridge caught my eye.
The picture, her school photo, the one that I had grown accustomed to seeing, was gone.

I went back to the living room. My sister was standing still, phone slipping from her hand.
It hit the floor and bounced once against her bare foot.

Tears filled her eyes.
“She never made it,” she whispered.



I called my supervisor and explained the situation.
Told him we had a missing juvenile.
Told him about the missing poster I found.

He assured me that all hands would be on deck and told me to wait there so my sister and I could give statements when the other officers and detectives arrived.

Even though my sister was distraught, we still needed answers.
I asked her about the missing photo from the fridge.

She looked confused.
“I never took that photo down. Why would I?”

The pit that had already settled in my stomach felt like it was spreading through the rest of my body.

I told my sister not to move and stood up slowly.
I took the gun from my holster and began to clear the house.

Something hung over the place.
I can’t put words to it, but it didn’t feel right.

The last room left to check was my niece’s.
I opened the door and stepped inside, ready to confront anyone, or anything I saw.

Her room was always a disaster.
Clothes on the floor, toys everywhere, half finished drawings on the desk.

Now it was spotless.
Bed made with perfect corners.
Toys put away in every bin they belonged in.
No clothes on the floor.
Not even dust on the dresser.

I called for my sister.
She came to the doorway and froze.

“Did you clean this? Did she clean this?” I asked.

“No.” Her voice was flat, empty. Then she broke down crying.



The first unit showed up less than ten minutes after I called it in.
Blue lights rolled across the front of the house, painting the walls.
Two uniforms came through the door, calm but moving fast. One of them knew me. He didn’t say anything, just gave a small nod that seemed to say we got it from here.

I holstered my weapon and stepped back toward the kitchen. The energy drained out of me all at once. I could feel the weight of the gun pulling at my belt, the sweat drying cold under my vest.

A detective arrived next, followed by crime scene techs. They moved quietly, professional. My sister sat at the table with a blanket over her shoulders, answering the same questions again and again. I tried to focus on the facts for my statement. Time, location, who found what, but my mind kept jumping back to that room.

A tech brushed powder over the doorframe, then over the dresser. Nothing but smudges. He went to the window next. After a minute he called the detective over.

They had found prints on the inside glass. Small ones. Too small to be mine, too defined to be old.

Outside, the radios crackled. More units canvassing the neighborhood, checking the bus stops, talking to anyone awake.

I stood by the front window watching the reflection of red and blue pulse across the street. Then a voice came over the radio.

“Dispatch, we’ve got something at the bus stop. Another poster. Different photo, same handwriting.”

Everyone in the room went still.

The detective looked at me.
“Stay here,” he said quietly, and headed for the door.

I watched him leave, lights spilling after him into the dark.

I wasn’t about to just stand there so I followed.

The photo seemed to be taken that morning.
My niece standing at the bus stop, backpack on, head turned toward the street.

The detective asked, “You take this?”

I didn’t answer.

Because we both knew I hadn’t.



The detective kept the photo sealed in an evidence sleeve. He told me to go home, get some rest, let them handle the canvass.
I nodded, but we both knew I wasn’t going to sleep.

My sister needed me. My niece needed me.
I walked back to the house to tell my sister what we’d seen. Her world was crashing down around her. She shouldn’t be alone.

I convinced her to grab a few things and come stay with me until we figured this out. With no other choice, she agreed.

We stopped by the precinct to pick up my personal car.
Not many words between us.

I looked over at her.
“We’re going to find her,” I said. “I’m going to find her.”

No response. She just stared out the window.

When we pulled into my driveway, I got out first and grabbed her bag from the back seat.
The porch light flickered once as we walked up.

Something was stuck to the front door.

Even before I read it, I knew what it was.

Another missing poster.

Another different photo.

It was from my birthday.
My niece hugging me, both of us smiling at the camera.

A picture that only I had.
A picture that was in my living room.



The detectives came to sweep my house.

The doorframe showed no forced entry. No prints.
The birthday photo was gone.

That night, sleep never came.
My sister was on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, the TV still playing from where we’d left it. The volume was low, a soft hum under the silence.

I checked the doors twice. Then a third time. Every lock. Every window.

When I walked back into the living room, my sister had finally drifted off, exhaustion winning over panic.
I went to grab another blanket for her.

That’s when I noticed the empty space on the wall.

I couldn’t believe someone had been in my house.
I couldn’t believe ANY of this was happening.

Then I heard it.

A faint whirring sound from down the hall.

I followed it toward my office. The sound grew louder, steady.

When I opened the door, the printer on my desk was running.
Pages spilling onto the floor.

I stepped closer and picked one up.

A missing poster.

Same format. Same bold letters.

Each one a different photo of my niece.

1o7a9ui,https://i.redd.it/vv19smaow9vf1.jpeg,New flat and lobe(first cartilage experience),"Got my very first cartilage piercing two days ago (yay). I also got my third lobe piercing and it was a little crunchy which shocked both my piercer and myself which they said indicates at least some cartilage was pierced.

I’m not gonna lie y’all, my flat was SO painful! Way worse than I was expecting so I’m either a baby or have thick cartilage. I actually got a little woozy and had to take a few moments before they could do my lobe. The lobe also hurt but it was forgotten easily (probably because the flat was distracting me from it), but I did end up taking Advil once I got home since my ear was throbbing and had a headache. The headache only lasted that day and likely just an adrenaline crash but I’ve been taking Advil still since the pain is definitely still a little “stabby” and throbs if I don’t. 

I know bruising and pain is normal but I was not expecting so much pain to be on the outer edge of my ear away from the flat piercing. Even just touching the outside of my ear (helix area) hurts so I’ve had to be extra careful and won’t even sleep on that side with my piercing pillow for fear of bumping it. I assume this is normal and should go away soon?

I can’t see the back of the flat easily without a mirror so I just aim my saline spray back there and spray a good amount of mist. I also use a clean coffee mug to gently pour warm water over the back while tilting my head over the sink since I don’t shower daily. Is this adequate or should I be having my SO try to do a better job? 

Also how important to dry completely? I’ve just been using a towel to blot it dry without touching and then just sort of fan my ear from a distance with a piece of cardboard since I don’t have a blow dryer. I really don’t wanna touch this thing if I don’t have to!

- welcome mocktail drinks - 100 cups
- donut wall - 72 pcs jco and 90 pcs munchkins
- pinoy streetfoods - 200 assorted stix
- sushi - 192 pcs (12 variants)
- unli drinks - bluelemonade and gulaman + water

- 4:30 PM - processional
- 5pm - ceremony
- 6 pm - pre-dinner cocktail hour serve 2 small bites appetizers and drinks
- 7PM - proper dinner starts


We’ll only have 1 location for both ceremony and reception, so it’s a continuous flow from welcome hour to dinner.

Just wondering, do u think this setup is already enough for the 3pm start until dinner at 7pm? Or should I add more food to keep everyone happy while waiting?

Step 2- In the MCQ Section, use the title and bottom part of the passage which help you to surmise a passage's main themes. Also learn about distractors, things that are logically plausible in the multiple choice answers but arent in the passage.There are also absolutes i.e All or Must in the answer boxes, these are almost always wrong.There are also half truths as well as inaccuracies these can be in all the possible answers or some of them.

Step 3 – The Process of Elimination is vital for this exam.  This is a difference between a 23 or a 27 in my books.That's how critical it is.make a note on eliminated choices in ur lamented paper. Lamented paper is underrated, its a toolkit not a hinderance

Step 4 – Practice, practice, it sounds cliche, but if u just spam the LNAT practice papers ur brain just becomes attuned to the exam and the analytical questions.Also watch out for negative questions.  

Step5-Rest, sleep, exercise are game changers; fine margins matter.P.s I did the Lnat with little to no sleep but drinking coffee along with an adrenaline rush was sufficient enough to keep on [guard.Im](http://guard.Im) not too confident in MCQ section and my essay was a little less sophisticated than i wanted it to be but alas such is life.

Step 6-Ignore everyone who says u cant revise for the exam, it is not an aptitude test but a test of acquirable skills that anyone can harness with due time some more naturally and quicker than others.

Step7- Youre done relax, speak to some family, enjoy life dont ponder or be anxious, simply embrace your thoughts of anxiety and see it as beneficial; the Dunning-Krueger effect exemplifies this. I doubt and dread my MCQ i had 8-10 qs flagged up, and didnt get enough time to review them.Also dont worry about spelling mistakes on the essay they ar positively marked

In that same time frame, I ended up needing a new tank cuz the seal was worn. Fast forward to the last few weeks and I've had it where the pods don't brew a perfect cup. Twice now, I've had it where it's either the brew has gone everywhere in the pod area, or it has gone into my cup. Both times, coffee grains were the result and both times, the pods have been ""water logged"", for lack of a better term. I also descaled it earlier this week too and always use a Zero Water filter system in my tank 100% of the time.

I'm thinking that it's not worth putting more effort into fixing it anymore and it's time to move onto something else. It doesn't owe me anything cuz it was gifted to me in 2011/2012 and it's lasted this long. If any of the above has happened to you and if you were able to fix it, I'm all ears. Thanks in advance!

1o7a2pw,https://i.redd.it/rpjjmpgtu9vf1.jpeg,Should You Get Your Teeth Polished or Whitened? Here’s How to Decide,"If you’ve ever looked in the mirror and wished for a brighter, cleaner smile, you’ve probably wondered whether you need **teeth whitening** or just a **dental polishing session**. While both treatments improve the look of your teeth, they serve very different purposes.

At [Team Dental](https://share.google/BRqTOOSakuUw9bs5g), our experienced **Dentists in Viman Nagar and Pune** often meet patients who use these terms interchangeably. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right treatment for your goals — whether you’re looking for a whiter shade or simply a cleaner, healthier smile.

# What Is Teeth Polishing?

**Teeth polishing** is a **professional cleaning procedure** performed by your dentist or dental hygienist. It’s part of your routine dental cleaning and is designed to remove **surface stains, plaque, and tartar** from your teeth.

# 🦷 How It Works

* Your dentist uses a **soft rubber cup** and a mildly abrasive polishing paste to smooth the tooth surface.
* This process removes **extrinsic stains** (the ones caused by tea, coffee, or tobacco) and leaves your teeth feeling smooth and glossy.
* It’s typically done **after scaling**, which removes hardened tartar deposits.

# ✅ Benefits of Teeth Polishing

* Fresh, clean, and smooth tooth surfaces
* Removes surface stains and plaque buildup
* Improves gum health and prevents bad breath
* Makes it harder for new plaque to stick
* Great for **maintenance between whitening sessions**

  **Dentist in Pune** at **Team Dental**, explains:

“Polishing is about hygiene and maintenance. It’s like detailing your teeth — keeping them clean, healthy, and stain-free — but it doesn’t actually change their color.”

# What Is Teeth Whitening?

**Teeth whitening**, on the other hand, is a **cosmetic dental procedure** designed to lighten the natural shade of your teeth. It targets **intrinsic stains** — those that occur inside the enamel — caused by age, genetics, certain foods, smoking, or medication.

# 💡 How It Works

* Whitening uses **safe bleaching agents**, typically hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide.
* These chemicals break down deep stains inside the enamel, giving your teeth a visibly brighter appearance.
* At **Team Dental**, we offer both **in-clinic laser whitening** and **take-home whitening kits** customized to your needs.

# ✅ Benefits of Teeth Whitening

* Brightens your smile by several shades
* Boosts confidence and appearance
* Quick results — often visible after one session
* Safe and professionally supervised

# 🦷 Teeth Polishing

* Focuses on **removing surface stains and plaque** buildup.
* Done during routine cleanings to keep teeth smooth and glossy.
* Improves oral hygiene, gum health, and breath freshness.
* Does **not change the natural color** of your teeth.
* Recommended **every 6 months** as part of preventive care.

# ✨ Teeth Whitening

* A **cosmetic procedure** that lightens tooth color using whitening agents.
* Targets **deep, intrinsic stains** caused by coffee, smoking, or age.
* Performed using safe, professional-grade bleaching gels.
* Results in visibly **whiter and brighter teeth** in one session.
* Can be repeated **once or twice a year**, depending on lifestyle.

# Which Treatment Should You Choose?

It depends on your goal:

* Choose **polishing** if you want your teeth to feel fresh, smooth, and plaque-free.
* Choose **whitening** if you want to **brighten your smile** and change the color of your teeth.

In many cases, dentists recommend **doing both** — polishing first to clean the surface, followed by whitening for the best cosmetic outcome.

# Safety and Aftercare Tips

Whether you choose polishing or whitening, maintaining your results is key.

# 🪥 After Polishing:

* Brush twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste.
* Avoid smoking and dark-colored beverages for at least 24 hours.

# ✨ After Whitening:

* Avoid foods that stain (coffee, wine, curry) for 48 hours.
* Use desensitizing toothpaste if you experience mild sensitivity.
* Schedule follow-up cleanings to maintain brightness.

# Professional vs. At-Home Whitening

While over-the-counter whitening strips and toothpastes exist, they often produce uneven results and can increase sensitivity.

At **Team Dental**, our **in-office whitening** uses clinically approved products that protect your enamel and gums while delivering noticeable results safely and effectively.

**Dr. \[Name\]**, a **Dentist in Viman Nagar**, notes:  
“Professional whitening gives you predictable results and ensures your gums are protected — something DIY kits often fail to do.”

# Why Choose Team Dental for Your Smile Makeover

If you’re searching for a [Dentist near me](https://theteamdental.in/dentist-in-viman-nagar/), **Dentist in Viman Nagar**, or **Dentist in Pune**, **Team Dental** offers a full range of preventive and cosmetic services under one roof.

Our services include:

* Preventive cleanings and polishing
* Professional teeth whitening (laser & gel-based)
* Dental implants, crowns, and bridges
* Smile design and aesthetic restorations
* Orthodontics and aligners

We combine modern technology with personalized care to help every patient achieve a confident, radiant smile.

# Final Thoughts

While both **teeth whitening** and **polishing** enhance your smile, they serve different purposes. Polishing focuses on **cleanliness and maintenance**, while whitening delivers **aesthetic transformation**.

If you’re unsure which is right for you, schedule a consultation at **Team Dental**. Our expert team will assess your needs, discuss your smile goals, and guide you toward the perfect treatment plan.

Because at **Team Dental**, we believe your smile deserves both — **health and beauty.**",1,1760532533.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I’ll have some good weeks where I sleep relatively okay (relativity being waking up one or two times in the night and falling back asleep without issue, usually still less than 8 hours in total however) and sometimes I have really bad bouts where I get around 3-5 hours and have no energy throughout the day, accompanied by chest tightness and pains.

After going through another bad bout this week and barely getting any sleep last night, I’ve come to a realisation that I can’t remember the last time I felt “tired”. Tired as in fighting to stay awake and dozing off. Even others who know me are amazed that I never drink coffee and can still function to some degree/not doze off during the day. 

Whenever I have a lack of sleep, I usually have low or zero energy, but I am usually still awake but just find it hard to function and can’t think/focus like I normally can and tend to laze around and not put in much effort and energy to my daily tasks.

I think this realisation has made me realise that my issues are purely mental and may point to stress/anxiety or high cortisol levels, even though I can’t identify things in my life that would be causing me stress. 

Another thing I find is when I try to relax in bed, my body/eyes start to feel “heavy” and it actually makes me feel more anxious because I am aware that I am still very much awake and trying hard to relax/fall asleep and that makes the problem 10x worse.

I am not sure where to go from here or what methods I should take, but I feel like at least this realisation has made me potentially identify a possible crucial trigger for my insomnia. ",1,1760532013.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

  This is also why we balk at a $2 monthly subscription but won't blink at a $2 chocolate bar. What's another pricing paradox that has always confused you?""",1,1760531966.0,u_DailyDiscoveryDude,1,1.0,True
1o79udp,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1o79udp/feels_like_my_partner_is_having_an_emotional/,Feels like my partner is having an emotional affair. She says otherwise.,"So this is kind of a messy situation, but I’ll try to keep it as short and clear as possible.

My partner (35F) and I (41M) have been together for about 6 years. Overall, it’s been a solid relationship. We started dating while I was still married but separated, and my divorce was finalized about 2 years ago.

For most of our relationship, she struggled with her weight. About 6 months ago she got gastric surgery and since then she’s lost over 80 pounds. Her confidence shot way up and honestly, I was so happy for her. She was finally feeling good about herself and doing things she couldn’t before.

Now, I’ve never really been a jealous person — or at least I didn’t think I was. She’s always had guy friends, gone out for coffee or dinner with them one-on-one, and it never bothered me. But after her surgery, she decided she wanted to start a “thirst trap” type Instagram account. Basically just showing off her progress and soaking in compliments. I supported it — she deserved to feel good.

At first, it was fine. Then she started talking to this international guy (let’s call him Red). At first, it seemed harmless like all her other online interactions. But I started noticing she was glued to her phone — especially late at night, sometimes 2 or 3am, because of the time difference.

Eventually, whenever I asked about Instagram, she’d only talk about Red. All her stories and conversations started involving him — how interesting he was, how funny, the sweet things he’d say. I let it go for a while but it was getting on my nerves.

The breaking point was when we went out on a rare date night. She spent most of it talking to him or sending him pictures of what we were doing. On the drive home she was messaging him non-stop and barely said a word to me. I finally said something and told her I wasn’t comfortable with it — that it felt like she liked him more than she was admitting.

She swore up and down that nothing was going on, that she didn’t have any feelings for him even though he did for her. She said he got upset and she blocked him. I believed her and things seemed okay for a bit.

Fast forward to yesterday — I got this random gut feeling to check her followers on her regular Instagram. And there he was. Red. Back again.

I brought it up right away and she told me she “missed the sweet talk and dopamine” she got from him. She said since I never specifically told her not to talk to him, she unblocked him — and didn’t say anything because I’d asked her not to tell me what other guys say to her online.

That kinda broke me. She’s never been secretive before. She used to overshare everything. And now I’m sitting here thinking, if she can hide this, what else can she hide?

I don’t even know if I’m asking for advice or just venting. I love her, but this whole situation has really shaken my trust.",17,1760531915.0,survivinginfidelity,20,0.9,False

There are objects we own, and then there are objects that seem to own a piece of our soul. Among all the things I possess, none cradles my heart quite like my IKEA wildkatt puppet, whom I named Choumao — “stinky cat” in English. Its fur, once a soft and brilliant white, has dulled into a tired grey from years of washing, each rinse erasing a little more of its youth. Its ears droop now, weary from time and touch, as if it too has felt the weight of growing up. Yet Choumao has never truly aged in spirit. Through every season of my life, it has remained one constant, holding not just my memories, but the version of myself I once was.

Perhaps Choumao reeks now, to others. However, this scent is born not of neglect but familiarity. The strange mix of old polyester fabric, dried drool, and something vaguely sour. Stinks like me! I used to fall asleep with it pressed against my face, soaking it with drool night after night until its fur stiffened and clumped together. Yet somehow, that very nastiness feels completely sacred.

There is also a reason for my attachment to Choumao. HIs stitched gentle smile remains unchanged no matter how many times mine has faltered. When I was younger, Choumao was my ultimate confidant — the one who listened when no one else seemed to understand. I would bury my face into his soft fur and scream my worries and in return, his blank eyes seemed to shimmer with understanding. Even after the whole shebang of unbearable screaming, he does not seem to mind, as if acknowledging each fragile confession. When the house felt oppressively quiet, I would cradle him in my arms, feeling the reassuring weight of his diminutive form grounding me.

Even now, when the world feels too sharp or burdensome, touching his worn bald spot elicits a strange sense of serenity for me. Choumao reminds me that companionship does not require words because they exist in presence, in the quiet comfort of something, no, someone that has matured alongside you. Choumao is not merely a puppet ; he is a living thread of memory, intricately stitched into the tapestry of my life. He represents my true self and ignites nostalgia. Till death may me and Choumao part.



Topic:Describe an unforgettable moment

The room was filled with tension, enveloped by a palpable hush. Long rows of desks stood in perfect alignment, each one spaced evenly apart, creating a sense of isolation despite the crowd. The air was still, occasionally punctuated by the rustle of papers and the quiet ticking of the clock. Each tick instilled a sense of urgency — a reminder of the passing time.

     I sat in my seat, brainstorming all my formulas and equations until I felt a familiar twist in my body. I fidgeted in my seat, trying to dismiss my discomfort. However, the clock’s ticking reverberated in my ears. How much time is left ? One more hour. My brows furrowed and my heart raced. I tried focusing on my paper, but it was hard to ignore the growing urgency. Perhaps I should not have eaten the bean-and-egg sandwich for breakfast!

     Five minutes had passed, and I was still battling my growing urge as it swelled quietly, persistently, refusing to be ignored. I knew that even the slightest sound could be magnified into a deafening echo. “Maybe I can let out my fart slowly.” I murmured under my breath. Would it be silent or loud? I contemplated. Nevertheless, I leaned back, attempting to release the pressure.

     “BRRUMPP!” a loud, unmistakable, thunderous fart resonated throughout the room.

     Heads of others darted in my direction, with some staring discreetly with amusement vividly painted across their faces. I could feel blood rushing to my cheeks as I buried my face in my hands. My heart sank as soft giggles echoed around me, each chuckle a sharp reminder of my miscalculation. The initial shock of others changed into a suppressed laughter. I desperately sought to reclaim my composure, however, a storm of contemplation raged within me. How am I supposed to focus now?

     In that moment, the exam room transformed from a sanctuary of academic seriousness into a stage for my embarrassment. I furiously scribbled on my paper, trying to appear unfazed. Nonetheless my facade still shattered and I glanced around, hoping to find an ally who understood my situation. Yet all I found was a sea of amusement, leaving me to rue my ill-attempt at relief.

     “ Time’s up!” The invigilator yelled. The exam was over. It felt like time was dragging its feet throughout the incident. Strangely, I felt a sense of relief walking out of the exam venue. The air buzzed with chatter as few of my friends teased me. “Great performance!” “That was pretty loud.” I chuckled with my peers, realising that this moment, although mortifying, has become an unforgettable memory.

     While I would never forget this embarrassing experience, I learnt that laughter can replace the weight of shame. Life can be messy and unpredictable, but we can find peace within chaos.



Topic: describe an activity you find joy in or something i forgot (i wrote this for prelim got 23/30)

Nested beneath a shophouse along a quiet stretch of Tiong Bahru, a quaint cafe blends effortlessly into its surroundings. Its faded green awning flaps gently in the humid breeze while potted ferns line the entrance like shy greeters. The clink of ceramic cups and the soft hum of the overhead fan spill out into the street, blending with the distant chatter of hawker stalls nearby. Inside, the air is crisp and calm, providing me with an icy relief from Singapore’s ever present heat. In this little corner of the city, this cosy cafe has become my favourite place to unwind.

The scent greets me the moment I open the wooden door. A comforting mix of roasted coffee beans, warm pastries and the faint floral, smoky aroma of oolong tea. The walls are painted a soft beige, adorned with numerous framed black and white pictures of old Singapore, lined with bookshelves and leafy plants that spill over their pots like lazy green waterfalls. As usual, I sit by the frosted window, where the outside world blurs like a watercolour fading at the edge.

My go-to-order? A pot of bitter oolong tea and a slice of pandan chiffon. The tea arrives in a delicate porcelain teapot. Pouring the steaming liquid into the cup, I watch the curling steam dance upwards. The first sip is always a surprise. It is bitter, almost sharp, with an earthy undertone that lingers at the back of my throat. The bitterness is strangely calming; a reminder that not all comfort has to be sweet.

Then comes the cake —- a soft, fluffy slice of pandan chiffon. The sponge is light, almost cloud-like, carrying the distinct fragrance of pandan leaves that evokes the warmth of childhood mornings. On top of that, a thin layer of coconut cream coats the surface, not too sweet, just enough to balance the airy texture with richness. Each bite melts smoothly on my tongue, fragrant and nostalgic. Paired together with the oolong tea, both of the flavours hold a quiet conversation.

Time moves differently in this cafe. Minutes here stretch slowly, like warm viscous honey dripping off a spoon. Around me, people are lost in their books while some are rhythmically typing away on their laptops. The distant sounds of the bustling city fade to a gentle murmur, replaced by the soft boss nova jazz played from a hidden speaker, filling the silence comfortably.

When my cup empties and the last crumb of cake is gone, calmness settles within me. The hectic pace of Singapore’s society awaits me outside, however, in this little haven paired with my comfort food and drinks, I have found a rare and precious moment of relaxation.

So this is my maternal grandfather, and he passed when my mom was 12, but I’ve always felt a very deep connection to him emotionally. I grew up in the house he built until around the age of 13, and knew of him all my life through my mother’s stories of him. I don’t have dreams about him, which is unlike me since other deceased relatives, like my father and maternal grandmother, appear in my dreams every now and again. 


I occasionally feel his presence like he’s standing in rooms, very briefly, but very undeniably like him. The other day I was just making coffee and listening to music, and a lyric that went, “Dead eyes, are you just like me?” and got the immediate sense that he was here and sort of melancholy? In an empathetic way? I’m going through some personal struggles right now, and I suddenly teared up when I felt him appear. There was another lyric that came up and it was, “Does she really know me at last?” And then he was gone. It felt like the lyrics were a message. 


I want to know if he’s doing okay. He had a tough life emotionally speaking. He was a wonderful father to all his kids. I wonder if he feels any affinity toward me, or why I get the feeling of so much love. Is there anything in particular that resonates between us? Something he wants to tell me? I often wonder if he’d like me as a person if I wasn’t his granddaughter.

This was a time when all payments were made by cash or cheque, there was no ATM machines at this time.

At this time, these refund cheques were for around $20 or so.

One afternoon, a lady came to the front counter and asked for the manager. I was called and came out to speak to the lady.

She told me that she had taken her refund cheque to the bank. She said she told the bank attendant she wanted to deposit the cheque in her account and handed it over to the teller.

The lady said the teller opened the envelope, looked at the cheque and suddenly went pale. The teller asked the lady to wait for a minute and ran off towards the back of the bank.

1o79pr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o79pr4/relationship_advice_aitah_or_dodged_a_bullet/,"Relationship advice, AITAH? Or dodged a bullet?","Me 31M, my ex 22F, we met in our workplace. Subordinate-supervisor relationship. She always looked for my company, because she said im the only one from who she can learn this job. I feeled she wanted more, but I didn’t looked for a relationship (i was through some troublesome time), but I liked her behaviour, and that she wanted to know even more from this job. My feelings started when we were out watching shooting stars in august. That was the point I realized I’m in love with her.

We started to talk more and more about our personal lives, and her relationship, in which she is not the happiest. She also repeatedly cursed her current partner in front of everyone (As I later found out, the guy took herl in because she had nowhere to live). I didn't move until it was clear that she had broken up with her previous partner. But before that, I tried to ask if they couldn't fix their relationship, but she wanted to move away from the guy at all costs. During their meeting in September, it turned out that they had not been together for quite some time with their previous partner, and by then he had moved out a long time ago because I indicated that I felt quite bad that he was spending time with me and not with her. To make matters worse, I brought her a gift every time we met (chocolate bars mainly), which was a bad habit. That's when the first kiss happened between us, which she initiated. I just wanted to give her a kiss on the cheek. At the beginning of our relationship, she supported me, listened faithfully to my dreams and desires, and encouraged me to achieve them. She asked that our relationship be kept a huge secret, she didn't want anyone to look down on her or make fun of her because of it.

Her girlfriend, with whom she shared everything, is currently in a relationship with 6 men at the same time. Specifically, they had a separate album of their conversations with me. (Screenshots from our messenger talks, this was a huge redflag)

Even at the beginning of our relationship, she was jealous of many female colleagues, in this same workplace, because I get on well with many of them and they seek my company, my advice, and share their problems with me. I have indicated to her several times that there is no reason for her to be jealous, I will not just leave her overnight. And I always told her about these talks with my colleagues in general terms (not to spill uncomfortable informations). It was then that she recounted in detail her very first relationship, which lasted three years, during which her partner left her overnight and broke up with her. (As it turned out later, she also cursed him in a similar way and took it out on everyone, even to his friends, whom he ""lost"", and she is very proud of that.)

I replied that in my previous relationships, unfortunately, I was also abandoned overnight, so I can completely understand her situation. I asked that if she had a problem, we should always try to sit down and talk it out, especially if we were hurting each other. She nodded at this sentence and said that she also thought this would be the right decision. As our relationship deepened, she told her best friend, whom I mentioned earlier, about everything, including our sexual encounters. This seemed a little strange, although as I read it, it was positively disappointing for her, because I was good in it.

She told me that she reported this to her, so I didn't come across this information through stalking. As our relationship progressed and she opened up more and more, she started to become distant. After a while, all we could talk about was work, no matter how hard I tried to bring up other topics.

Her family situation is not bright either, although she comes from a wealthy family. She has mentioned several times that hes relationship with her father is not the best. When her father found out about our relationship, she told him this „Did you spread your legs to get ahead?” After this we pretty quickly ruled out the family topic. When it came to the question of her coming to visit us several times, she always refused, saying she didn't want to, she isn’t in the mood. I was understanding with her for the reasons above, I indicated to her that my parents were open to meeting her. (my father and grandmother, unfortunately my mother passed away). Her mom often sent me cooked food and cookies, and my mom did the same for her.

Later, during one of their family video chats, her father ""threatened"" me by saying, that they are digging in their garden with her brother, and how big a hole do I need to dig for me to fit in? I overheard this conversation, I didn’t react. I managed to talk with her mother several times. Most often, during some kind of discussion, what was between my partner and her. For example, buying a laptop, which I tried to talk my ex out of, saying it was unnecessary, because I could give her one for her studies, I have anyway, and I would take her to a repair shop.

According to her, we broke up because I don't trust her, she doesn't trust me, and she felt several times that I didn't love her. I would like to note here that I bought flowers, brought her to work when I wasn’t, and also went for her, when she finished. I also drove here from point a to point b without questions, and I always heard her problems. I wanted to take her on a date many times, but she preferred to go to a restaurant with her best male friend. I voiced my problems several times, which led to huge arguments. I was jealous too. When she moved out of her previous apartment, I helped her move in to her new one, after which I wanted to spend some time with her, more intimately. She said she didn't feel like seeing me right now, which made annoyed, we argued, and she said tom e that „No one asked you to help me”.

Another factor that contributed to the breakup was that a colleague of mine was dumped by her fiancé after 4 years, and she called me once to ask if we could meet up because she needed me to talk to, because she didn't want to be alone and she was having suicidal thoughts. I also had them, in a point of my life. My ex heard the entire phone conversation because I was with her when it happened. I asked for her patience, asked if I would like to come with me, to which she immediately gave a negative answer, ""they can't see us together, it would be better if you didn't go either."" I told my colleague that unfortunately not now, but maybe another time would be good (I'm not the proudest of this answer). My colleague begged me at length, then my ex replied that I should go because ""your friend needs you."" We met at a bar, with 2 other colleagues, there were 4 of us in total. I reported on pretty much every minute what was happening, what we were talking about, and at that point we were also using a tracking app, so she could see where I was going. After that night, I developed an “even closer” relationship with my colleague. When we met, we always hugged each other (before that, we only gave each other a highfive), and that made her more jealous. (I would like to note: her former ex, who took her in, they still hug each other to this day, but she denied it when I asked her several times)

It also contributed to the fact that I once went to a pub with my colleagues and subordinates to have fun. On this occasion, I walked another colleague home because she asked me to (she's afraid of going home alone). When I was walking my collegue home, she asked if she could put his arm around me. I told her that I had a partner, and I didn't want to, but she could walk closer if it was safer for her. We stopped in front of my colleague's house to chat, which ended with her asking if I wanted to go up to her house for coffee (at one in the morning) because her husband wasn't home anyway. I answered no and immediately went home. I told her the latter part of the story after a long time because I was afraid that she would get into a fight with my colleague.

Every time I tried to spend time with my ex, she either didn't want to, claiming she was tired, or we would make it work in another time. I had experienced this tendency in previous relationships, and here too my anxious attachment came out, which only made the relationship worse. Meetings with her best malefriend (they go places together), zero intimacy (zero time spent together, e.g. sleeping over at each other's houses), and how I felt like she was trying to take advantage of me at work, to turn this relationship to his advantage. Furthermore, she kept telling me more and more about a college classmate I had never heard of before, which made me mad, and I laughed at her for saying she loved me and that unfortunately I needed proof of that.

Several of my colleagues have indicated that this relationship is not healthy. In front of their eyes, she treated me like a dog, to which I did not respond.

My question is, am I the asshole (AITAH) in this story or did I deal with a huge manipulative girlfriend and save myself from a long suffering? (I dodged this bullet). This 1 year we were together was relatively hard on me, and unfortunately I don't know what to do. Not long after, they got together with this classmate from his university.

It's a disposable account, but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

TLDR Based on my feelings, I was dealing with a manipulative toxic woman, and unfortunately I feel bad since the breakup. I feel like I'm stuck in a hole, and unfortunately I don't know if it's me who's wrong...",0,1760531573.0,AITAH,5,0.25,False

The client I drafted gave me 10 VP when cured but more importantly, allowed me to ""freely move insights horizontally.""

1. That's nuts. Usually it costs 2 coffee for horizontal movement. Not me.

2. I get that when the grief later is removed. Not when cured, just when grief layer is gone

3. Since I started the game with him, I get that the ENTIRE game

What happened: I was able to remove the grief layer by turn 2, so I could freely move the entire game. Several turns later on, I had zero coffee but it didn't matter because of that power. And I didn't even cure him for awhile because I didn't need to for his power. He just hung out it my office as I used the other office. I won the game (only by 9 points) but I feel like that guy is super OP, no?

If I didn't get it until I cured him, well still great, but that's like turn 4 or 5. The fact that I started with him and by turn 2 could use it? That's crazy.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been dealing with bad breath for about 12 years. It’s been so bad that people touch their noses, step away, or even make comments like “someone farted.” I’m a school teacher, so children aren’t shy about saying when something smells — and I’ve had that happen more than once.

What’s strange is that my family and husband say they don’t smell anything, which has always confused me. But I know something’s up because of how people react.

Over the years I’ve tried everything — probiotics, tongue scraping (I always had a thick white tongue), hydrogen peroxide gargles, diet changes, you name it. Cutting out coffee and dairy helped a bit, but I couldn’t give up coffee for long.

Then I started reading posts here about tonsil stones. I thought, “surely not,” because I couldn’t see any. But when I flushed with a water pick, a few did come out. I also started doing nasal rinses with a neti pot, which helped some more.

But the real game-changer — and I can’t believe it’s something so simple — was Cordysol mouthwash. It burns a bit, but it works. My tongue is now bright pink instead of white, and I haven’t noticed any reactions from people since I started using it.

I’m so much more confident now. Fingers crossed it lasts, but I just wanted to share in case it helps someone else who’s been struggling like I have.",3,1760531492.0,badbreath,5,0.8,False

1o79nm6,https://i.redd.it/90kfwk2qr9vf1.jpeg,Should You Brush Before or After Breakfast? A Dentist Near You Explains,"It’s one of the most common dental debates—should you brush your teeth before or after breakfast? Most of us were taught different routines growing up, and it’s easy to wonder which one is actually better for your teeth.

If you’ve been searching for a *Dentist near me* or a *Dentist in Pune* to help you build the perfect oral care routine, understanding when to brush can make a real difference in your long-term dental health.

In this article, the experts at [Jabade Dental ](https://share.google/Sm9fXGrZb9zMPkyaI)explain the science behind brushing before vs. after breakfast, the risks of each, and what leading dentists recommend for optimal protection.

# Why Brushing Timing Matters

Your mouth is home to millions of bacteria. Overnight, when saliva production drops, these bacteria multiply, leading to that “morning breath” and sticky feeling on your teeth.

The timing of your morning brushing routine determines how effectively you remove these bacteria—and how well you protect your enamel from acid attacks throughout the day.

# Brushing Before Breakfast: What Happens

Brushing **before breakfast** removes plaque and bacteria that built up overnight. It also coats your teeth with a protective layer of fluoride from your toothpaste, helping shield your enamel from the acids in your morning meal—especially if you enjoy coffee, juice, or citrus foods.

**Benefits:**

* **Protects against acid erosion:** Fluoride strengthens enamel before it’s exposed to acidic foods.
* **Fights morning bacteria:** Cleans away plaque that accumulates overnight.
* **Freshens breath before eating:** Keeps your mouth feeling clean as you start your day.

**Dr. Jabade’s tip:**

“If you love having orange juice or coffee in the morning, brushing before breakfast is the safest option. Brushing right after acidic foods can actually wear down enamel.”

# Brushing After Breakfast: The Common Mistake

Many people prefer brushing **after breakfast** to get rid of food particles and morning odors. While that makes sense, brushing immediately after eating—especially after acidic foods—can do more harm than good.

After meals, the enamel temporarily softens due to acid exposure. Brushing too soon can scrub away this softened enamel, increasing sensitivity and long-term wear.

**If you prefer brushing after breakfast**, dentists recommend waiting at least **30–45 minutes** before brushing. This allows your saliva to neutralize acids and re-harden your enamel.

**Best practice:**

* Rinse your mouth with water after eating.
* Wait 30 minutes, then brush gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush.

# What Leading Research Says

A study published in the *Journal of Clinical Dentistry* confirms that brushing before breakfast provides stronger enamel protection throughout the day compared to brushing afterward.  
Similarly, the *British Dental Journal* notes that early-morning brushing helps maintain a healthier oral pH balance and reduces acid erosion risk.

# The Ideal Morning Routine (Recommended by Jabade Dental)

Here’s how you can start your day with the healthiest possible smile:

1. **Brush immediately after waking up.** – Removes bacteria and coats teeth with fluoride.
2. **Eat breakfast.** – Enjoy your meal without worrying about acid damage.
3. **Rinse your mouth with water or mouthwash.** – Wash away food particles and neutralize acids.
4. **Floss after breakfast (optional).** – Keeps spaces between teeth clean without harming enamel.

This simple routine ensures both cleanliness and enamel protection.

# What Happens If You Don’t Brush Before Breakfast

Skipping morning brushing allows bacteria to feed on sugars from your food, producing acids that attack enamel and cause cavities. You may also notice stronger bad breath and plaque buildup, especially if your diet includes sweet or sticky foods.

Over time, this can lead to gum inflammation, tooth sensitivity, and in severe cases, tooth decay—conditions that may require restorative treatments such as **Dental Implants**.

# Final Thoughts

So, should you brush before or after breakfast?  
According to dental experts, **brushing before breakfast** offers the best protection for your teeth and gums. However, if you prefer brushing afterward, remember to wait at least 30 minutes to avoid enamel erosion.

Small habits—like the timing of your brushing—can make a big difference in your oral health.

“What is it now?” Adam looked up from his desk as Minx came in. He was going over a border conflict between the Bylgono-Hyna nation and the Sandors -Sinino nation. Both claimed a system named Relsad, as they had bought it from the federation for mining and colonization.  It was rapidly escalating into a war, and Adam had Roks send their fleet to a battle system to release the bloodlust. However, both refused to sign the treaty, rendering the battle systems moot.

“I’m sorry, sir, there is a new wave of pirates near the Funiad sector. That’s mostly Rigallos' farmlands. We have sent the fleet there.”

“Okay, and why was this so important that you had to come here personally?” Adam leaned back and said a silent prayer. “Please be good news.”

“I’m sorry, they are led by a pirate who claims his name is Hanur Mutt, he is part of the lost fleet and claims to be the younger brother of Captain Jargy Mutt, survivor of the Siege of Dirt.”

“FUCK!” Adam stood up, wanting to hit something. “OUT!”

Minx left immediately as Adam cursed the Mutt family and all its descendants to never be pirates ever again, to be law bringers, bounty hunters, and judges for all eternity. It took him an hour to calm down and then he sat down and called up the two regents.

“Greetings, let's fix this. You both have a claim to the system yet due to a computer error.  Duchy of Sinino bought it first, but... stop, I’m not done.” He looked at Duke Mysnia, who was celebrating. “The Dutch of Sinino did not move in or build anything for three years. During this time, the Republic of Hyna moved in and built three mining stations and started a colony on Relsad, not knowing about the claim of the Duchy of Sinino. And here lies the problem.  Had the Duchy of Sino left clear evidence of ownership, this would have been addressed in court long ago, and I would not have needed to come to me. To be honest, I should not come to me. This is a matter of the court, but alas, they asked me to mediate.” He looked at the two holograms.

“So I have a few solutions, none of which are beneficial for either side, and one that might work. So I can let you guys fight, no good, pick one side and make the other side angry, but it's up to you guys,”  As he said the third, they both perked up, he ignored it, he did not want that. “Or we find a solution. Republic of Hyna bought Relsad for asteroid mining and colonization, while the Duchy of Sinino bought it for farmland and ocean Aquaculture as well as colonization. You do know the answer has been staring you guys in the eyes the whole time.  You can share it. The planet can easily hold 8 billion without straining the ecosystem, 10 if you terraform parts of it.” He looked at them, and the two looked at him, dumbfounded.

“But I own the deed.” Duke Mysnia said, and Adam nodded.

“Yes, as does the Republic of Hyna, possession is nine-tenths of the law; they possessed it before you. But they are not after what you are, you can make a treaty and share it. I’m going to be honest. You're both going to lose some, but you might also win something. “

“And what would that be? I’m losing half the planet and lots of trade.” President Samid said.

“Well, you hammer out a treaty, then I’m tossing in a gateway and a small trading hub, it's a perfect crossroad to both your nations. That way, you all will be directly connected to Dirt's trade hub, which should cover some of your losses.”

They looked at him, confused, and then nodded. “Yes, yes, we can make a treaty. We will make a treaty.” They managed to stammer out, Adam didn't really understand why they were so shocked to be connected directly to Dirt, but shrugged.

“Good, contact me when you have hammered out a treaty, and I will have my men start the process to add Relsad to the Gate contacts. Thank you for your cooperation, and let's hope this is a lasting peace. The gate depends on it. Thank.” Then he cut the contact and sat back.

He decided to take a break, and when he got outside, he saw Minx and apologized for his outburst. Minx just laughed and told him he should be careful with his curses. Adam laughed and dragged him with him for lunch at one of the nicer restaurants in New Macao. While they were eating, they got a message about the human weapons company being sold to Long-Kerr LLC.  Adam looked at the news and shrugged. Knug could not win them all. He read the declaration that Ares was moving its headquarters away from Earth to Centauri Prime due to unrest on Earth.

“Smart move, I've been checking up on the Earth's street journalism. Apparently, there are daily demonstrations and riots. It’s a… what's the word you humans use? Powder keg about to explode?” Minx said, and Adam nodded.

“Yeah, that’s Arus' work. Let me guess, they are not happy with President Agnivanshi?”

“Yes, they accuse her of being connected to a criminal network. Life is not going her way lately. Lots of her donors got caught in a fire at a VIP party, and over a hundred of the guests died. “

“What? Everybody died?” Adam asked as he looked at him, and Minx shook his head.

“No, no, no, mostly lawyers and media agents. A few high-profile singers and actors as well, but it was a big party and most got out safely.” Minxy said, and Adam smirked slightly.

“I wonder if those who died had anything in common,” Adam said.

“Well, considering Sig-San's latest message, I would say yes,” Minxy replied. Adam looked at him, so he explained.  He said he had finished half the shopping list but found some more things to buy, he might add.”

“Oh… Yeah.. well that explains that.” Adam said as he looked at his watch. “Damn, this month has gone fast. I have to go home and call my wife. When is the fleet arriving by the way?”

“Within five days, Roks is running drills,” Minxy replied, and Adam sighed.

“This better work,” Adam replied.

“It will. Oh, Hyd-Drin sent a cryptic message. Ghostships observes.”

“Oh, that’s what he was up to. Stealth ship. Well, guess we are going to get a lot more intel now.”

They finished the meal, and after Adam called up Evelyn, they discussed what to do with the teenage camp. When the triplets came into view and saw Adam, they tried to hug the hologram and got upset as they fell through. Evelyn said they were angry at  Chriss and Wei for hiding, and then suddenly she stopped and grinned. “If they want to play grown-ups, then it's time they learn.”  She said, and  Adam looked at the triplets and got it.

“That’s evil Evelyn,” Adam said, and she just smiled.

“What do you want to be a grandparent so soon? Besides, I will be nearby with some of the adults, but we won't interrupt their little ritual. Let's see if they can last the last month.”

 Adam laughed as he knew Wei would never be able to handle it, he was not so sure about Chris.

.

Three days later, he was called to the command center of Sistan, which had been moved there since the last attack; it was better to keep it away from the main city. Adam found it ridiculous, as there was a small diplomatic city around the north wall of Sistan as well. But it was small compared to the city of New Macao, which has five million inhabitants.

He stood in the room looking at the screen and the gathering fleet. He had alerted the old ones, but they responded by connecting him to their advanced radar system, allowing them to see the five fleets approaching at light speed. Each fleet had twenty-one ships. He guessed they expected to overwhelm whatever Dirt could muster. They were profoundly mistaken.  Every nation in the federation had sent ships or a fleet. Dirt was quite crowded.  Roks was in the middle of it all on his dreadnaught, the Hammer. He seemed to have full control and placed fleets around to ensure no ships were at risk of a crash with the incoming fleets. Roks had been working with Jork about a surprise, and there were some new drone ships spread around the system that, if they worked, would change the battle completely.

 An Aid brought Adam a cup of coffee, and he accepted it as he saw the first fleet put out of lightspeed. It immediately opened fire on the closest ship and then stopped. Only a few rounds reached the intended targets before drones attached themselves to the human ships and activated an extra shield, inverted so that whatever they fired bounced off a shield a hundred meters from their hull. The human ships were contacted and asked to surrender. They didn’t respond, but the main ship activated a blackhole bomb, then it was deactivated just as fast. The next fleet emerged and just hung there, looking at the number of ships facing them. Some of the ships turned around and tried to jump into lightspeed again, only to find their engines deactivated.

The third and fourth fleets jumped in, fired wildly, then had drones attached and seized their firing.  Adam looked at the rather lackluster invasion attempt. Roks was calmly giving orders and trying to contact the ships to make them surrender. But none of them replied. When the fifth fleet entered, it entered, and  the main ship blew up as it dropped out of lightspeed. And for a second, all alarms blared as a black hole was forming. Then a beam hit the explosion, and it stopped.  An Elohim hologram appeared between the two fronts, the huge glowing angelic humanoid spoke, and it was heard on the channels. ***“The black hole bombs have been deemed too dangerous for children to play with. Any attempt to use them in war will invoke our wrath.”***

Adam chuckled. “So that’s why they were so eager to help.”

The aid looked at him, confused.

“They wanted everybody to know they are still around and active. This is the best way to get the message across. They have the technology to stop a detonated bomb, and they won't allow us to play around with the technology. It’s a warning not just to humanity but to the galaxy. And to be honest, I agree. Sometimes you have to lay the law down.”

The Aid nodded and looked at the screen. Roks told the human fleet one last time to surrender before he would be forced to open fire, and this was a battle they would not be able to win. He gave them ten minutes to decide. While the humans thought about it, Roks had the ships surrender and ensured that if they attacked, the battle would end very quickly.

“We surrender.” Admiral Harrison finally declared, and Adam sat down and breathed out.  He knew the EUC fleet had sent a report home before surrendering; he saw it with the recording.  He doubted they would send more fleets up here. Still, there were other ways they could strike, and President Agnivanshi was still in charge.

Christofer Blackthorn looked over at him from his command console, “I hope you have a place for half a million POWs.”

“oh I know just where to place them.  Junti. It's beyond the gate, but we have to transport them, im not letting their ships through.”

“Junti? Isn’t that the new world you're developing there? the one with a new city?”

“Jupp, we put them there, disarm them first of course. It's seven light-years from the others, making it perfect for use as a POW camp. We just have to give them no transport, and they can enjoy the planet in peace and quiet. We made the tech level there is around the 21st century for that reason.” Adam replied, and Christofer chuckled.

“I trained you too well.” He replied.
