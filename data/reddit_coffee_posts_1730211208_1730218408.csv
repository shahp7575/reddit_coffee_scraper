i bought a motherboard  called ""zebronics Z310"" for my 9400. At that time i was not that much knowledgeable about them so i bought whatever i got.

now i heard minimum system req. for windows 11 is intel 8th gen. but despite having 9th  gen processor i couldnt update it to win 11.

on checking hwinfo i found my motherboard is  actually B250 which supports only 6th and 7th gen, but somehow hacked into supporting 8th and 9th gen as well.

and since technically this motherboard is older than what win 11 requires i couldn't upgrade (not that i want but some games require TPM 2.0 which this one lacks)

well This really shows that if intel wanted they surely could have Done what AM4 did. supporting upto 5 gens of processors. 

As my hacked motherboard really support whole four gens of intel cpus lol.",1,1730218275.0,pcmasterrace,0,1.0,False

YET this coffee somehow managed to be worse. 

I drank only 1/3 of it, I had to eat something else outside, and still I'm having that bad aftertaste.

1gey9rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/felinebehavior/comments/1gey9rm/seeking_advice_for_cats_who_wont_get_along_after/,Seeking advice for cats who won't get along after trying EVERYTHING,"Hi everyone! My partner and I (Both 25F) are struggling to get our cats to get along, to say the least. Buckle in for a long post. 

TLDR: **My partner and I’s cats don’t get along despite having tried what feels like everything. We want to get community input on behavioral ways to address this before contacting a cat behaviorist.** 

**Some background on each cat:** 

Suki (3F) was adopted by my partner when she was a kitten. Suki had lived with my partner, their parents, and their parents' cat (3M) for a little over a year and had no social issues. **Suki has always had an anxious demeanor but had a good relationship with my in-law's cat**. When my partner and I moved in together in June of 2023, Suki struggled with adjusting to our new apartment (She had gone from living in a quiet rural home to living in the city on a busy road). She would hide frequently, and she didn’t confidently explore our home until September or October.

I adopted Romeo (2M) in July of 2023, around a month after we moved in. **Romeo was a street cat, who was taken into a neutering clinic, as they thought he was feral. They quickly realized that he was a sweetheart** (His original name was Loverboy if that gives you an idea of what he’s like).  Romeo was not with his foster mom for long, but during his time there, he spent most of his time in a crate in a room with other cats. Though he was separated from the other cats, he didn’t show any indication of not wanting to be around other cats.

Both cats are incredibly afraid of any loud or unusual noises (Romeo has jumped multiple feet in the air before because of a coffee grinder, ultrasonic cleaner, vacuum, and more. Suki has reacted less adversely to those sounds, but she will freeze if sirens go by our house, if someone yells, etc). **Romeo is a fighter, and Suki is a flighter, which has created a huge hurdle in getting them to peacefully coexist.**

**Romeo and Suki’s timeline together:**

In hindsight, we didn't properly introduce the cats. Because Suki had no issues with cats before, and Romeo was so sweet, we didn’t think there would be any issues. 

For a while they coexisted, but would have a squabble every now and then. **Their squabbles were usually Suki just chilling, and Romeo BOLTING up to her. She of course would get scared and run, and he would go after her more. When this would happen we would separate them, and after a while let them socialize again. This went on until around November 2023 after their squabbles resulted in fur flying and one or the other getting roughed up.** At that point, we started shutting one cat in our room, letting another cat roam free, and switching them at frequent intervals. During this time **we used Feliway diffusers and collars, as well as natural anti-anxiety supplements like L-Theanine. They did not help at all.** 

On New Year's Day, we put up a “cat screen” (It’s like a mesh screen door that gets stuck to a door frame) to separate the cats. Our apartment is easily split in half due to its weird setup, so **each cat would have half of the house to themselves. We would still make sure to swap sides, hoping that mixing smells, sharing food, litter boxes, etc, would help. (It didn’t)**. 

Around mid-April, I started Romeo on Kitty Prozac, and a couple of months later, Suki went on it too. Suki had a much more adverse reaction to it, it made her more scared than she already was. It took seeing Suki’s bad reaction to realize it made Romeo lethargic. Needless to say, **we stopped giving them the Prozac, it just wasn’t for them**. This was around August.

From March to April, we would have the cats do a “treat and Greet” where they get treats in the same room together. We did this after seeing them play under the door, and be able to eat food up against the screen together peacefully. Once the Treat and Greets went well, we started having them hang out in the same room as us (Romeo on a leash). Eventually, this went well enough that he could be off leash, and after a couple of days of him acting normal, we would step out of the room. At this time, I believe Romeo was still on Prozac, Suki was not.

**During this time Romeo would try to approach Suki. She would growl at him, and he would listen and walk away. This went on for a few days. One day, out of nowhere, he started going after her again. We went back to separating the cats and starting from the beginning.** 

**Romeo and Suki started taking a small dose of the sedative Gabapentin** within a week of each other sometime in September. On Romeo's first night on the medication, we brought him and Suki together to have a sniff moment. **Despite being on** ***gabapentin*** **he leapt out of my arms and went after her.** 

Since that incident, we have kept them separated, and haven’t had any squabbles. Recently, however; the cats have figured out that our screen is just stuck to the wall with adhesion, and if they try hard enough, they can break through! Both cats have weaseled their way through numerous times in the middle of the night. Since the apartment is split in half, we alternate which cat sleeps with us each night. We tried shutting our door for a couple of months and having neither cat in our room at night, but it didn’t help, and was sad for all of us. Both cats have tried to get through to sleep with us, knowing fully that the other cat is also there. 

**Romeo and Suki will chat through the screen, play under the door, and peacefully eat with the screen separating them**. **But they still cannot be in the same room for more than 5 minutes without fighting.** They both seem to *want* to be together, but Romeo comes in hard and fast, and Suki is skittish, making an awful combination. 

**We are at such a loss. We feel like we have tried literally everything, and are tired of getting false hope of them getting along. Rehoming either one of the cats is simply not an option. If you’ve made it to the end** ***THANK YOU*** **for taking the time to read. Any insights are much appreciated. We’ve already tried “natural” medicine and supplements and they haven’t helped. We are looking for behavior-based solutions.**

1gey86x,https://www.reddit.com/r/starsector/comments/1gey86x/domain_phase_labs_exotica_tech_mods/,Domain Phase Labs & Exotica Tech Mods,"I'm a long time Starsector player,  been playing off and on since 2013 and usually come back every year or 2 for a playthrough again. I added around 40 mods, got the Java 23 upgrade patch/mod, and booted up a save (I was and still am extremely pleased with how much the java 23 patch increases performance, it's INSANELY GOOD) but decided to play things a bit different this time around.

Normally, I play a medium-difficulty run, nothing hard-core or any difficulty adjustments but this time I wanted to switch it up and do things different than I normally would.

I gave myself the hard start, in a tiny little shuttle with some debts I never mention and no friends to boot. Cranked up the Nex difficulties a bit and added a mod that caught my eye, exotica technologies. In the description it mentions it can increase the difficulty of certain fights and whatnot and thought it looked pretty cool to try out. Time passes and I work my way up, tried out the exotic techs a bit and while I thought they did make it a little harder, it was manageable.

Enter: Domain Phase labs colony crisis

Never added domain phase labs before, and also I was not aware colony crisis were a thing until I had an endless supply of pirates to kill. Ended up figuring out it was a new game mechanic and got the pirates off my ass and then started getting ""mysterious raiders"" attacking my 2 colonies.

Now, I'm not the kinda guy to yield to demands, I actually named my captain ""John Starsector"" and as fitting of the name, when asked to bow or yield, John Starsector instead shits in your coffee and sat bombs your capital. But John unknowingly was about to face the hardest starsector campaign he had ever faced. 

The interaction between Domain Phase labs and Exotica Technologies has spawned some of the hardest fleets I have ever had to fight, ENDLESSLY. The fleets are massive compared to what I was seeing sent over by the pirates or even the Persian league, and on top of that the exotica tech has a lot of upgrades that directly enhance and inject steroids or something into the phase lab ships.

I thought that was bad enough having to constantly fend these fleets off (I'd always end up with a few ships and a capital or 2 destroyed at the end of every battle, had to manually tip the battle with my flagship every single fight or I'd lose) but the crisis event reached it's major event.

The raiding fleets were even worse. I could barely defend a single station from 2 of those fleets at once and it resulted in the destruction of the station and every single one of my ships minus my piloted super roided odyssey (it had 613 hull left by the end of the fight). I haven't even finished them off, there's still 6 more of them (pursing my fleet) plus something like 8 more mysterious raiders and I can't keep up with the sheer volume of fleet power and bullshit they can throw at me.

I will not yield. I'm sitting at work plotting my way to eventually sat bombing every planet they own and removing their home system from this realm of existence even if my colonies fall to the onslaught.

I'm curious if anyone else has had this specific experience with these two mods. I love the challenge ngl but man, it feels almost a tad unfair at times. I suppose I could go meet with whoever in their home system but I don't know what they want and I assume they'd just make some demands and I generally, in starsector, prefer violence and war crimes instead of yielding.

If you're ready to take a natural stance on anti-aging skincare, consider integrating hydrolyzed collagen, vitamin C, astaxanthin, and retinol into your routine. Here’s how these powerful ingredients can help you achieve glowing skin.

# Hydrolyzed Collagen: The Foundation of Youthful Skin

Collagen is a crucial protein that maintains skin elasticity and hydration. Research published in *Skin Pharmacology and Physiology* found that supplementing with hydrolyzed collagen can significantly improve skin elasticity, moisture, and overall appearance. Ancient Nutrition’s delicious multi-collagen protein in vanilla is perfect for your morning routine—mix it into your coffee or fruit smoothie for a tasty boost. It not only enhances your skin’s texture but also supports joint health, making it a two-in-one solution for aging gracefully.

# Vitamin C: Your Skin’s Best Friend

Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis and offers antioxidant protection against free radicals, which can accelerate skin aging. A study in the *Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology* indicated that topical vitamin C can significantly improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Now’s Vitamin C supplement can provide a powerful antioxidant boost that works from the inside out, helping to brighten your skin and reduce signs of aging.

# Astaxanthin: The Potent Antioxidant

Astaxanthin, a carotenoid found in algae, has been shown to provide remarkable skin benefits. According to a study in *Nutrients*, astaxanthin can enhance skin elasticity and moisture while reducing the appearance of fine lines. Life Extension's Astaxanthin supplement is a fantastic addition to your regimen, providing a potent dose of this natural antioxidant that helps protect your skin from sun damage and oxidative stress.

# Retinol: The Gold Standard in Anti-Aging

Retinol is widely recognized for its ability to improve skin texture and reduce wrinkles. Research has shown that retinoids promote cell turnover and collagen production. Baebody's Retinol serum or cream can be your secret weapon against aging skin. Users often report smoother, more youthful-looking skin after just a few weeks of use, making it a staple in many anti-aging routines.

# Personal Experience

Incorporating these products into my daily regimen has been a game-changer for my skin. After a few weeks of using hydrolyzed collagen in my smoothies and applying retinol serum at night, I noticed a remarkable difference. My skin felt firmer, more hydrated, and had a noticeable glow. The combination of vitamin C and astaxanthin provided me with an extra layer of protection, especially during sunny days, and I felt empowered knowing I was taking a natural approach to my skincare.

I am struggling with the fact that how am I going to do with my mandatory course work and how will I be able to write a good draft of my work if I can't even retain knowledge or explain myself.

Then comes my co-suoervisor. He talks everything with me. Work, family, food, movies, relationship, future plans what not. Shows concern about future. But he always check who is coming in the lab who's not. If someone's missing, he personally call them and ask the reason. Everyday he takes all lab students for coffee.

Although most days are okay in our relationship, he has been physically abusive for 10 years, roughly once or twice a year he will lash out and physically put his hands on me. He has done things like choke me, punch my arms and legs, throw hot coffee on me, etc. He is also emotionally abusive towards me, when we get into disagreements he will name call, talk poorly of my family and call them names, etc. I am not naive to the fact that I am a victim of spousal abuse, and I am not the type of person to normally be passive, I am usually
Very vocal and stick up for myself, but I don't know how I got into this situation. 
My biggest issue is that he is a good father to our child, our child idolizes him and sees him as a hero. Our toddler doesn't normally witness any of the abuse but has picked up on my partners moodiness and lack of involvement in social activities at times. 
My partner suffers from anxiety and depression, he hates life and is a very negative person. He hasn't worked in many years and doesn't contribute at all to our family financially. I am the sole provider and have been for 6 years. He is on medication for depression but doesn't seek any other forms of help or try to help change his life. 
I know that I want to leave him but am struggling with the guilt of leaving him with nothing. Even though he is often very horrible to me, there is still love there since he is the father of my child. All I want is what's best for my child, and I fear that if I leave him, this would have to be in secret because I am scared there may be a blow up or violence, I'm worried his mental health will take a limit and he will harm himself. I'm also worried that he will not be able to financially support himself and provide a stable home for himself and our son. ",1,1730217195.0,u_Gold-Distribution406,0,1.0,False

Looking for a long-lasting lipstick that won't let you down? I recently tried L'Oreal's Infallible Matte Resistance Liquid Lipstick, and I was impressed.

This lipstick claims to last up to 16 hours, and I found it lived up to that promise. I put it on in the morning and it stayed put through meals and drinks. The matte finish looks great and doesn't feel heavy on my lips.

https://preview.redd.it/2vc9ut4avpxd1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c2f5da0d9585aad9e3cc7e68828626ec7dfa700

I tried the Tropical Vacay shade, which is a nice pop of color. The applicator made it easy to put on without making a mess. It has hyaluronic acid in it, so my lips didn't feel dry.

There are 12 shades to pick from. I like that it doesn't smudge or transfer, so I don't have to worry about it getting on my clothes or coffee cup.

# Bottom Line

If you want a lipstick that stays on all day, L'Oreal's Infallible Matte Resistance is a good choice. It's easy to use and comes in lots of colors.

# Overview of L'Oreal Paris Infallible Matte Resistance Liquid Lipstick

I tried the Infallible Matte Resistance lipstick and was impressed. The liquid formula goes on smooth and dries to a powdery matte finish. It felt light on my lips and didn't smudge or transfer.

I wore it for over 12 hours and the color stayed bold. The applicator made it easy to line my lips and fill them in. I liked that it has hyaluronic acid to keep lips from drying out.

The shade range is nice with 12 options. I picked Tropical Vacay, a pretty coral color. It gave me a fun pop of color that lasted all day.

While long-lasting, it can feel a bit dry after many hours. A tiny dab of lip balm helped refresh it. For the price, I think it's a great matte liquid lip option that really stays put.

# Lasting Comfort with Hyaluronic Acid

I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this lipstick felt on my lips. The hyaluronic acid in the formula really made a difference. My lips stayed hydrated throughout the day, which is rare for a matte liquid lipstick. I didn't experience any dryness or flaking.

The lightweight feel was a big plus. I often forgot I was wearing lipstick at all. It didn't feel heavy or sticky on my lips. This made it easy to wear for long periods.

While the hydration was great, I did notice the color faded a bit after eating and drinking. A quick touch-up was needed to maintain the bold color. Still, the overall comfort and moisturizing effects impressed me.

# Precision Application for Perfect Lips

I found the applicator on this L'Oréal lipstick to be really impressive. It has a pointed tip that makes it easy to line my lips precisely. I was able to create crisp edges and fill in my lips smoothly without any mess. The formula glides on evenly in one swipe. I didn't need to go over areas multiple times. This made application quick and foolproof. The lightweight liquid dries down fast to a powdery matte finish. It doesn't feel sticky or heavy on my lips at all. I can barely tell I'm wearing lipstick. The color payoff is bold and vibrant right away. I didn't need to build it up. Overall, I found applying this lipstick to be effortless and mistake-proof.

# Vibrant Color Selection

I was impressed by the range of shades available for this lipstick. L'Oreal offers 12 different colors, giving plenty of options to suit different skin tones and preferences. I tried ""Tropical Vacay,"" a vibrant coral-pink that really pops. The color payoff is bold and true to what you see in the tube. One swipe gives full coverage, which I found convenient for quick application. The matte finish looks smooth and even on my lips. While I like the variety, I wish there were a few more neutral options for everyday wear. Still, most people should be able to find at least one or two shades they love in this collection.

# Matte Finish for a Modern Look

The matte finish of this lipstick gives a sleek, modern look. I love how it dries down to a powdery texture that feels light on my lips. The color stays put for hours without smudging or transferring. I didn't need to reapply even after eating and drinking. The matte effect makes my lips look smooth and velvety. It's perfect for a polished, put-together look that lasts all day. The finish isn't drying like some other matte lipsticks I've tried. My lips felt comfortable wearing it. The only downside is it can flake a bit after many hours of wear. A quick touch-up fixes this easily. For a long-lasting matte lip color, this one is hard to beat.

# Pros and Cons

I recently tried out the L'Oreal Infallible Matte Lipstick and have some thoughts to share. This liquid lip color has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's break it down:

# Pros

* Long-lasting wear: I found it really does stay put for hours, even through eating and drinking.
* Bold color payoff: One swipe gives rich, vibrant color.
* Precise applicator: The wand makes it easy to apply without mess.
* Lightweight feel: It doesn't feel heavy or sticky on the lips.
* Transfer-resistant: Once dry, it doesn't smudge or rub off easily.

# Cons

* Drying: My lips felt a bit dry after wearing it all day.
* Flaking: I noticed some flaking after several hours of wear.
* Drying time: It takes a few minutes to set completely.
* Limited shade range: Only 12 colors to choose from.
* Can be hard to remove: You'll need a good makeup remover to take it off.

The Infallible Matte Lipstick lives up to many of its claims. I love how long it lasts and its bold color. The precise applicator is a nice touch. But it's not perfect. The formula can be drying, and I wish it came in more shades. For the price, though, it's a solid choice if you want a matte lip that stays put all day.

# Customer Reviews and Sentiments

I've noticed this lipstick has gotten a lot of buzz lately. After trying it myself, I can see why people are talking. Many users praise its long-lasting power, with some saying it stays put for up to 16 hours. The color selection is a hit too - lots of folks mention finding shades that match the online pictures well.

Some key points from reviews:

• Doesn't smudge or transfer • Feels lightweight on lips • True-to-image colors

Not everyone loves it though. A few users said it can feel drying or flake after a while. Some also noted it takes time to dry down fully.

Overall, most seem happy with the lipstick's performance and color payoff. The staying power is a big plus for many. If you don't mind a matte finish, it could be worth a try.

# L'Oreal Paris Brand Credibility

I've used many L'Oreal Paris products over the years, and their reputation in the beauty industry is solid. The brand has been around for decades and is known for quality makeup at reasonable prices. Their Infallible line, which includes this lipstick, is popular for long-wearing formulas. L'Oreal invests heavily in research and development, often bringing innovations from their high-end brands to their drugstore lines. While not perfect, their products generally deliver on their promises. I find their shade ranges to be inclusive, catering to a wide variety of skin tones. The brand's global presence and partnerships with diverse beauty ambassadors also boost their credibility. L'Oreal Paris strikes a good balance between affordability and performance in my experience.

# Conclusion

I'm truly impressed with this L'Oréal liquid lipstick. It lives up to its claims of long-lasting wear, staying put through meals and drinks. The color range is great, with options for bold and subtle looks. While it can feel a bit dry, the matte finish looks sleek. The easy application and intense pigment are big pluses. For the price, it's a solid choice for those wanting all-day color without constant touch-ups. Just keep in mind it may need a gloss if you have dry lips. Overall, I'd recommend giving this lipstick a try if you want reliable, long-wearing color.",1,1730216959.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

I (46f) have 2 sisters (49f) and (44f).  My older sister and I have never really been close but anytime she has needed a babysitter for her kids or needed anything, support during really challenging times in her life, help moving, financial assistance etc I have put aside our differences and helped out. 
5 years ago I left my abusive husband and took my 3 (10,13,15 at the time) kids with me. I had no place to go and so we lived in my parents one bedroom. My older sister never once offered to help me out during the worst time in my life. In fact she met with my ex and had coffee with him and talked to him and ask him why I had left and she believed his side over mine (even though she never asked me why I left or what happened). 
She to this day believes I should have never left and that despite never asking me anything am a liar and should still be married to him and trying to fight for my marriage. (I was married 17 years and together for 20). I tried yo make my marriage work and even offered reconciliation up until he filed the divorce papers. 

Last year I met a fantastic man who is gentle and kind and loves me for me and doesn’t try to change me. He loves my kids and they love him. 
My older sister however has yet to acknowledge his existence.  He was at my house last Feb (we had been dating almost 6 months )when the whole family was here to celebrate birthday, she ignored him and wouldn’t look at him and purposely left him
And i out of any pictures she was taking. (She continues to do this to this day leave us out of any pictures she is taking).
Then in Aug we had a family reunion to which he came and she again wouldn’t acknowledge him.  Wouldn’t even say hello, said she was too focused on the family that was there. We had a third family get together at Thanksgiving and she took a fit when my mom wanted a picture of the family, she stormed out of the house and said no to the picture if he was going to be in it. He was so gracious and stepped out of the picture and took it instead. (He really is a great man). 
Her excuse for treating him poorly is she has to protect her kids cause she doesn’t know this man.

I have always been there for my sister despite being her punching bag my whole life. (I got pregnant she took a fit through things and drove away like a bat out of hell when we told her, she blames me being g born for why she’s has attachment issues and why she acts the way she does etc) and because she believes I should have never gotten divorced I shouldn’t be dating and shouldn’t get remarried if and when the time comes. So I have cut her off from everything in my life except for larger family gatherings despite my moms attempts to have us get together (her and I and her husband and my boyfriend) for a lunch and hang out.  Am I wrong and should I swallow my pride and just do the lunch and hang out just the 4 of us?",3,1730216778.0,AITA_Relationships,3,1.0,False

1gexi7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1gexi7f/1st_week_review/,1st Week Review,"After some back and forth with my insurance company, Zepbound was approved and I started last Wednesday. Thought I would give some feedback in case anyone was interested:

**Prep:** Nothing, really. I made sure not to eat anything too filling or greasy the day prior. Bought some fiber pills, Calm Magnesium Citrate, Fairlife 42g Protein Shakes, and some chewable Pepto tabs (just in case). I get kidney stones on the regular, so I purchased some Crystal Light. Say what you will, but studies have shown that it helps with Kidney Stone prevention, plus it tastes good when you need something other than just regular H2O. I already had Tums, so no worries there. 

**Day One:** I did an initial weigh-in and logged it into a few suggested apps: Happy Scale, Shotsy, and MeThreeSixty. Shot myself in the stomach. 2.5mg. Shot it cold. No pain. A tiny drop of blood at the injection site. I didn't feel any different. Ate normally. Took two Calm before I went to bed.

**Day Two:** I woke up around 3a, and was super nauseous. Took a two Pepto tabs, laid back down, and about an hour later, felt ok and fell back asleep. My body felt a little ""funny"" all day. I can't put my finger on it, but it was just kind of sore all over. I had two cups of coffee in the morning which is typical for me and I skipped breakfast. I had a good lunch - a filet and veggies. I wasn't really hungry for dinner, but I ate a little something (a VERY little something). Took two Calm before I went to bed.

**Day Three:** Felt good. Same routine as the day prior. No issues really. Took two Calm before I went to bed.

**Day Four and Five:** This was the big test for me - the weekend! On Saturday, we went to my daughter's soccer game, and on the way there we stopped at Burger King. I was feeling pretty hungry, so I ordered my usual: two bacon cheeseburgers burgers, though I axed the fries/onion rings and stuck to my water. I finished the first burger (they are pretty small), but couldn't finish the second one. I was shocked and could not believe that I was actually full. Crazy. No dinner on Saturday. Sunday came around and that always means football and pizza. Instead of my normal 4 or 5 slices, I couldn't eat more than 2.  Again, no dinner, though I probably could have eaten as I was starting to get hungry, but I skipped it because it was getting late. Plus, the grease on the pizza didn't sit well with my stomach. The Tums came in handy. Kind of made me sad.  I love me some pizza.  But, hey - I also love me some skinny me, so it's a trade-off, right?  Took three Calm before I went to bed.

**Side note:** Up to this point, I had been sleeping REALLY well. Probably better than I have in months. Not sure it has anything to do with anything, but I have been enjoying hitting the sack at the end of the day. I have also been cold - like really cold. I am typically hot-blooded and I like my house borderline freezing. My wife is the same way, but all this week I have been walking around the house with a fluffy jacket on. (I work from home.) 

**Day Six:** I wasn't just hungry, I was HONGRY and HANGRY. I woke up hungry and I felt like I stayed hungry all day. I was irritable and grumpy and had a pretty short temper. I tried to keep to myself for most of the day and avoided interacting with my family. According to Shotsy, the residual dosage was on the lower side, so I guess that makes sense. I did what I could to keep my eating in check, but the struggle was real. Sleep wasn't great.

**Day Seven:** Today. I am less irritable, but it's gonna be a tough food day. We will see how it goes. I am looking forward to my next shot tomorrow morning. 

**A Few Closing Notes:** I didn't experience any real constipation, but I wasn't as regular as I was before. I haven't dipped into the fiber pills - maybe I will, maybe I won't. We shall see. I didn't have any real side effects other than waking up nauseous the first night. At the end of this first week, I lost 2.6 pounds, which I am cool with. I am not out to break any records. I didn't gain this weight in a week and I won't lose it in a week either.  ",0,1730216087.0,Zepbound,1,0.5,False

1gexgxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1gexgxl/i_know_who_put_bella_in_the_wych_elm/,I know who put Bella in the Wych Elm ,"My name is Henry Johnstone, and I have a confession to make. By the time you are reading this, I will be dead at the age of 98. My grandson, Jules, is helping me write this out as I am on my deathbed. I do not have a lot of time left, so I figured before I leave this world today, I will come out with the truth. 

You may have seen the title of this post and wonder who this is ""Bella"" I speak of. I am sure there will be some folks who recognise the phrase, ""Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?"" But for those who don't know, it was part of a series of graffiti about an unidentified murder victim that was forcefully ensconced in a wych elm around Hagley, Worcestershire. Some say she was a prostitute from Birmingham who disappeared three years prior the discovery. Others say she was connected to a German spy is WW2. It was a mysterious and haunting case that had plagued our community since 1943, and to this day, many don't know what really happened, who the culprit was or who this ""Bella"" was. Well, no one but me. I know the truth, and the truth is that there lies a darker story behind a woman in the tree. And although I do not think it is exclusive to the town of Hagley, I am positive that anyone who has experienced what I have will understand the mutual fear and dread. Perhaps this confession is a cautionary tale of sorts. Perhaps I'm speaking to an empty crowd. Here is the truth.

There was never a ""Bella"" at all, not that I knew of. The mysterious woman's name was Kornelia. Her last name though? No one ever knew. She was may be enigmatic when she was alive. But as far as I know, she was a Polish Jew who fled her homeland by herself during the occupation of Nazi Germany during 1939. Kornelia was... an odd woman to say the least. She was never sociable, and whenever she was, she spoke with a quiet, shy tone. You could distinguish her from the crowd; she was very short (I believe she was around 5'0), had these crooked teeth when she smiled, and wore a golden wedding ring. She was never seen with someone. Kornelia was not an outdoors person, but when she would leave home, it was mostly at nighttime. It was peculiar by that time. 

I did not speak to her as much when I was a young lad. There was not much to speak to her about, and to be honest, I found her a little strange. That was until I started to notice her nightly routine. Some nights, I would look through the window and see Kornelia walk out her front door. I remember she had a candle lantern and she would first look up at the sky. Depending on whatever she saw, she would either stay home or go for a short walk. It had not been too long before a few folks noticed this behaviour, and one day, I volunteered to go confront her. It was the last time I spoke to her.

It was the Autumn of 1941; I was 15 that time. I had visited Kornelia when day broke, and as I arrived at her doorsteps, she looked delighted to see me. She and I were the same height.

""Oh hiya, Henry,"" she greeted in fluent English. 

""Good morning, ma'am,"" I replied. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you perhaps."" When hearing the request, Kornelia seemed a little hesitant. I notice she was caressing her tummy in an anticlockwise motion.

""Is there something wrong I did?"" 

""No. Well, not that I say is wrong. I just wanted to talk.""

She nodded slowly as if she was thinking. ""OK. Come in. Do you want tea of coffee?""

""I'm fine thank you.""

The interior of her house was just like any other in Hagley. Nothing out of the blue. That day; it was a bit messier, but who knows. It might have always been that way. I saw photos of her with her family, her as a little girl, and her holding hands with a man. We had never seen her with anyone when she moved here; perhaps she wanted to keep those aspects to herself. I didn't bother asking her that. We both sat on two birch chairs facing each other, and Kornelia grabbed her cup of tea and stirred and drank. 

""So, what is it you wanted to talk about?"", she asked as she smiled. She had a tooth missing at the bottom of her mouth. 

""Well, I don't want to come off as rude, but I have been noticing your habit,"" I said calmly. 

""My 'habit?'""

""Yes ma'am, your habit. You tend to go for a walk at night to do ‘something.’"" Her smile faltered a bit. ""Is everything alright? Some of the folks have noticed this too.""

She stirred the tea again. ""Yes dear, everything is fine. I was hoping to keep this a secret."" Kornelia looked at me as if she was worried about me. Before I got to ask another question, she stood and went somewhere. ""Stay here,"" she told. ""I need to give something to you."" I complied and sat, and I waited for her until she came back with a flat box. She sat again and opened the box, and she got out a wooden crucifix. 

""I want you to have this,"" she said. 

I looked at her, confused. ""Why?""

""For protection.""

""Protection from what?""

""Henry, do you ever notice how strange the moon is?"", she questioned. 

I shook my head. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""The moon. Do you feel as though it's 'watching' you? Like it's some predator hunting you down. Do you ever notice something on the moon?” Her question confused me to the point that I felt uneasy with her. I shrugged. 

""I don't know; not really I guess.""

""Good,"" Kornelia said, as she edged the crucifix to me. ""Still, I want you to have this."" I glanced at the item, and then the woman. I reluctantly took it.

""I still don't know why I should have this."" Then she came out with an odd explanation.

""Look; I'm sure you're not allowed to go out at night, and that may be the best thing your parents did. But if for some reason you find yourself outside, make sure you have the cross. If you see a ring around the moon, run as fast as you can back home. Run home and do not go out!""

I squinted at her. ""But why? None of what you said makes any sense.""

""It's better not to talk about it further. It knows we're speaking. But this is between you and me. No matter what, do not go outside, Henry,"" Kornelia told me with this urgency in her voice.
 
“Who’s ‘It?’”, I questioned. She did not answer. “Who’s “It,’ Kornelia.”

“I think I have said enough.” That is all I can remember of the conversation. But needless to say, I left with more questions and a slight apprehension. The conversation was too weird to brush aside. What she was talking about and why she was being so... vague. What was this 'It' she referred to. It was downright peculiar. 

So, I decided to keep an eye on her the more, and that resulted to me following her one night. It was, without a doubt, the greatest mistake I've ever done. Because while I still live to tell the tale, my involvement came at the cost of Kornelia's life. 

One night, I was fully dressed when I saw her coming out her home. She wore a dress with old-timey shoes, and she cradled her belly from the bottom. She held out that familiar lantern, looking up at the sky. Hagley back then was a little more rural, so there weren't many lampposts where I lived, making it too dark to travel. What Kornelia was doing was essentially asking for a death wish. I waited for her to make a move, and once she did, I carefully exited through my window. 

I was outside and was far enough that she wouldn’t spot me. It was cold outside, I remember that. It's strange how fear can make you remember everything vividly. Even to the most minute aspects taken place. I can remember hearing the subtle crunch of the dried leaves, the sound her shoes made when smacking the gravel, and the sound of the wind blowing against me. 

We were walking on the road for 3 minutes until I saw Kornelia hold up the crucifix in the air. It was then I realised I stupidly forgot mine at home. I should have gone home at that instant, but I was too invested in this. I thought there was no turning back from here. I was young and stupid, and I should've known better. So, as she walked, I followed on. A moment later, I realised we arrived at the woods.

As she entered the woods, I started to question what on earth she really was doing. Why is she going in Hagley Wood at night? 'There can't be a good reason,' I thought, while following her. Slowly, I came close to not lose her. 'Is she really being serious? What is the meaning of this?'

Then I remembered the conversation we had. I looked up and saw the full moon. Just like she said, around it was a 'ring.' Nowadays, folks call this phenomenon a 22° halo. But back then, I thought it was some once-in-a-lifetime supernatural occurrence. There was a sense of trepidation that crawled up my spine when I saw it. Without hesitation, I went up to Kornelia. We were about knee deep into the forest.

""Kornelia,"" I called out, and she immediately turned. Her brows were crossed and her eyes were wide.

""What are you doing here,"" she hissed. ""Why did you follow me?!"" I couldn't answer. There was an awkward silence between us. Kornelia quickly looked up and saw the moon and looked at me again. ""Do you have your cross?"", she questioned.

I shook my head, feeling a little guilty. Kornelia looked around her like she felt she was being watched. She lent her own crucifix to me, forced it in my hand. ""You should not be here, you know. We need to go! Now!""

""Why are you going to the woods at night?"", I asked. 

But before she could answer, suddenly her mouth was covered with a long silk cloth. Kornelia instinctively dropped her things and did her best to remove the cloth to no avail. The sudden attack made me fall on my ass, and that was where I saw her being lifted by something. Then I saw it. Something hovered behind her with a pair of blinding lights like headlights. Only they were not just lights, they were eyes. White, menacing eyes that pierced right through me. I froze right there, like I was entranced by it.


Then I saw the hulking figure, and I felt all types of fear at that moment. I knew instinctively it was some kind of demon. They say that demons are just little red men with horns and a tail, but I beg to differ. It was white, all white. Its ‘body’ was a huge, draping blanket being blown in the wind. The demon’s head was a skull of some animal; I assume it’s from a cow. Its horns were long and curved.

It towered over me as it choked Kornelia with its solitary tentacle-like strand. While being suffocated, Kornelia pointed at the cross. Noticing this, there was another strand that appeared and wrapped around her arm and snapped it in half. And as painful as it sounded, she couldn't scream. Seeing that, I let out a high-pitched cry as I scurried away from it. That was when the demon flung the unconscious Kornelia to the side like some ragdoll. Its next target was me. 

With haste, I grabbed the crucifix and booked it out of the woods. I felt my heart race, maybe even skip a beat. I ran away from that place like the wind. Whatever that thing was, it would kill me if I didn't reach home. It was not long until I saw the demon chase me with multiple white strands from its bottom outstretched. I raised the crucifix up high, and it stopped at once. 

It hovered there about a few meters from me. I noticed there was this ring around its horns. That was when it all made sense. I looked up at the moon, then at the demon. This was what she meant. The ring. 'It must be some warning,' I thought. But the thing? While yes, it looked otherworldly and frightened, it had this sort of holiness to it. Like a bastardised version of holiness. No, I don't think I can even consider it an angel. I wouldn't even dare.

The thing stared at me for what seemed like a long time. It had no visible mouth, and even then, it never said anything. No noise, no nothing. As I inched backwards, it went back to the woods. It was gone as soon as it came, just like that. I sprinted back home, and everything was a blur after that. 

All I can remember was that, after that point, everyone in Hagley seemed to forget there even was a Kornelia. Like her very existence was just erased from our memories. Her photos were never there. The house she lived in was vacant. I admit I also forgot her, until two years later when the four boys found a skeleton in the wych elm in Hagley Wood. News broke out in the community, and the memory of the night came rushing back to me. Her warning, the moon, that thing. It hit me like a lorry. I never told anyone this, because they would think I am some lunatic.

Then came the graffiti, and the infamous pseudonym that was the talk of the town. At first, it was ‘Luebella,’ then it was the aforementioned ‘Bella.’ There were talks about the victim being a sex worker or a lover of a German spy. How the body being stuffed in the wych elm was a work of witchcraft. Eventually, the case was dropped and the victim was still unidentified. No one even knew who the one doing the graffiti was, but I have no doubt it was it. This was its own twisted way of mocking the victim. 

To this day, I have been haunted with the memory of this forgotten woman. If there was a way I could go back, I would change everything with no second to spare. But if there's one thing I should say, it is that if you see a ring around a full moon, stay inside. Don't go out, no matter what. If it is for a juvenile party or a late-night job, forget it. Nothing is worth the risk. And if it happens that you find yourself outside, just know it will come for you as it came for me.

So, as I lay on my deathbed, I have given you the truth. I know who put 'Bella' in the Wych Elm, and some folks call it the '22° Angel.'

1gexefs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gexefs/friend_is_being_lovebombed/,Friend is being lovebombed,"My best friend met a guy in February this year after a tough breakup. He immediately showered her with gifts and other actions of washing her car, taking it and filling it with gas, getting her coffee every morning, weekly flowers, etc. This seemed really nice  considering her previous boyfriend never did any of this, and she likes to feel loved. After a month or so, he slowly moved into her apartment, kind of like one day he slept over and never left type of situation which she didn’t mind. Her job contract was ending in June, so during this period she was actively interviewing for jobs in other states/cities. He also started putting job applications to the cities she was applying. 

They officially moved in together in July in the city she got a job, and since he struggled to find a position, he took a lower paying job. All of the original love actions still continue.

In September, this man started messaging me about buying a ring, although I have never met him in person. He had also never met her other best friend or sister. 

October: The other best friend and sister finally meet him. During this encounter, he was mostly quiet and didn’t engage in conversation despite being asked questions about himself/family life. He mostly mulled in silence. The girl let slip in passing that this man had recently started seeing the same therapist as her. The sister was upset because she also sees the same therapist. The sister confronted the therapist, and the therapist replied that he was having a lot of struggle with the loss of his mother. Alarmed at this response (violation of HIPAA), this led the sister (and the rest of those concerned) that what is stopping this therapist from giving details of the girlfriend’s therapy sessions to him.

I finally meet him and am met with a sickening feeling in my stomach. We were supposed to spend the entire weekend Friday-Sunday together with our significant others, however he changed plans and didn’t arrive until late Saturday. Then after about an hour of her and I having a drink alone together insisted that she needed to go home. I was immediately triggered at this and voiced my opinion. He was silent for the rest of the night (which they left early). The following day we were supposed to meet for breakfast, also did not show up until the afternoon. We went to a festival and he refused to allow her to leave his side to check out a booth. Weirded me out even more. She asked for my opinion when we were alone later that night, and I told her how I felt about everything. She was upset, so I tried to blow it off by saying maybe it was just a stressful weekend and he wasn’t himself.

Today the other best friend woke up to a text saying he was purchasing a ring today.

What should we do? I don’t want to push her away, but I am concerned. I hope I am over reacting, as she deserves all the love in the world. 

EDIT: this man has also been married and divorced. The reason for divorce was that she cheated, however we only know his side of the story. She did not tell the other best friend about this. ",3,1730215816.0,AskWomenOver30,6,0.8,False

* **Homeowner**, so I'm not living with my parents and I'm stable financially.
* **No major debt**
* **I try and keep a decent haircut and dress nice though** could probably do even better in this department

Some things going against me:

* **Major lack of confidence**. I fixate on what I'm lacking: I'm 5' 8"" (not 6' tall), I've always had dark circles under my eyes and I'm really self conscious of them. Also my teeth could be straighter, they're not  horrendous but they're not perfectly straight and I know that's a drawback for a lot of people.
* **I don't do well on the apps** so I want to try more in person, I just kind of don't know where to run into girls consistently to even practice lol.
* **Because I've never been in a relationship it really seems like this insurmountable unobtainable thing** to me and I have it built up in my head so much that I know I sabotage myself.
* Don't really have many friends I can get out with so **anything I do it's solo unfortunately**.
* **I struggle when I'm solo and out and about**.
   * For instance in the running group though we stop for coffee / hanging out after the run, I notice everyone is usually in little groups talking with each other, and I'm sort of just off on the side lol, it's awkward as fuck.
   * I'm so nervous to just go up to a group and talk. I wish someone would just approach me but I think I give off bad vibes or something (maybe resting asshole face, maybe I need to make more eye contact / give the ""bro head nod"" to people?)

I want to take this seriously and improve in this area. I just want to not really care anymore as I think that's going to be really key for me. I'm looking for tips on this as I know once I start making improvements it's going to snowball for me and could really help turn things around.",2,1730215613.0,socialskills,1,0.75,False

Do mention: treatments, products, small things you do, derm advice, tricks for special events. 

With a focus on acne and hyperpigmentation, here are mine: 

(a) Don't wet your face before washing. Lather face wash in your hands and massage into dry skin. This helps dirt to adhere better to the soap.   

(b) If your face gets more oily throughout the day, cleanse in the afternoon instead of morning. Carrying a travel size cleanser is a game changer for me. 

(c) If a product is not working for you, it could be the combination you're using it with. For instance, if BP doesn't help your pimples, use BP and clindamycin together. If sunscreen breaks you out, use tret at night (a trick I learned from this sub). If you want hyperpigmentation to fade faster, pair tranexamic acid with tret. 

(d) Okay, this one is odd. Constipation causes skin issues. What helps is coffee, as it stimulates the intestinal tract. But it may not work for some as it is also a diuretic (ie. more water loss). I also have eczema flares after exercising and my derm says it is likely because of muscle inflammation. I theorize that at times, your facial muscles can get tired, and facial massage helps to relieve any muscle inflammation that causes skin issues. But don't do it and pull the skin when it is already irritated.",11,1730215412.0,beauty,20,0.92,False

I’ve been on my own for a while but now that I’m in this relationship I’ve started to work on accepting help and being okay with it. My spouse would tell me it makes him feel bad or like he can’t do anything for me because of how independent I am. I will also like to mention I’ve been told by many people I’m “such a guy”. I don’t know how to take that really, but I know I can be a dominant person or I have a dominant personality, I’ll say.

Why does my (25M) spouse, make me (24F) ask him for things in order for him to do it for me? But not how you think, this isn’t about me not asking for help putting away dishes, this is about financial support or completing acts of service. For example, I will mention needing something, like a new blanket, and he’ll ask me, “Do you want me to get it for you?” I’ll say no, and then he’ll (to me) feign irritation and then drop it. I personally think they are empty offers. He most recently told me he was going to buy something for me that was a little costly, when I went to order them and let him know I was ordering them, he goes, “Do you want me to get them for you? Are you sure?” I just said, “no”. My logic is that he knew I was going to get them and was okay with him buying them for me because when he’d offered it I’d said, “aww, thank you!” But then he turns around and asks me if I want him to buy it? I didn’t ask him about it or mention what he said because I felt like he didn’t want to do it because if he did, he’d have done it. That’s how I am. If anyone mentions anything to me and I see they haven’t gotten it, I get it for them. Or I’ll do something for them. 

For example, he recently complained about it being super cold at work so I went out and bought him hand and toe warmers the next day, and when he wanted to get lunch from some place but didn’t want to spend money, I figured out what he’d get and bought it for him. I do this not so I can get something back but because I love him and I want to be cared about in the same way. I know him so I know when he’s gaming, he’ll want snacks so I prepare variations of snacks for him. I know things that make him feel better so when he’s grumpy, I’ll do that, like I’ll get him a treat or I’ll buy something he’s been wanting. I’m not stranger to helping him with his work either especially when he has a lot to do. But, I don’t get the same treatment. He will send me money for food or will get me treats but not often. Maybe like, once or twice and I have to be feeling really shitty for him to do that for me. It’s never out of the blue. Even if I am going to get coffee, he will say, “Do you want me to get it for you.” Whereas, if he mentions needing new socks, I’ve already placed the Amazon order and it’s on the way. 

I just don’t like having to ask and he knows I already feel uncomfortable with doing so. I gave the example to one of my friends that it’s like bringing some pizza to your friend’s house, knowing they’re hungry, and then just waiting for them to ask. As opposed to handing them a plate and saying, “Hey, I know you’re hungry so I brought you some pizza.” I’m the type of person, I pick up on things and do them. I learn my loved ones and know who won’t ask for things but want or need them, things they’ll like, ways to make them smile and I go and do it. I don’t piddle around or tell them, “Oh, if you want this just let me know and I’ll get it.” I clearly see what they need or want and I do it (when I can).  I pick up on things because that’s just who I am and I like to show my love that way. I like learning people but he doesn’t learn me. Obviously not. I’m not trying to put myself on a pedestal here, at all, I know I have many flaws and I know people have different love languages but I learn them and I adjust accordingly.

And on top of all this, he talks about how he is a provider and it’s his culture to be that provider but he doesn’t try to provide. When we’re out it’s not like he’s fighting me for the check. I do let him pay unless he sits there as if waiting for me to use my card. He occasionally takes care of groceries, he’ll spoil me once in a blue moon, every now and then he’ll get me a big gift or something I’ve been wanting but I’ll have to hint at it for months for him to get it. He recently bought me a video game a few months ago that I had to hint about and blatantly watch Twitch streams on and walkthroughs in his face to get him to get it. (At the time I couldn’t afford it but he could.) Or, I’ll have to send multiple pictures of flowers and say, “I wish I had some” for him to get them for me and that in itself just makes me feel so crappy because I feel like I’m begging someone to notice me and care about me and love me and learn me. Like what the fuck. 

He will say, “Oh, I’m just going to stop asking you if you need or want things and just do it.” And I confirmed and told him that’s the trick with me. But he has yet to do it. It makes me feel like all his offers are empty because “if he wanted to, he would”. It just makes me frustrated too though, because why does he want me to do something a little humiliating for me just so he can do his job? 

And he’s not “broke”, (he has a few expenses but he doesn’t pay any bills besides his CC and auto insurance, I wouldn’t consider him as financially responsible as me though as he doesn’t budget. I pay bills for a family member.).

So, am I just being difficult to work with not wanting to ask for every little thing, or am I also the man in this relationship? If I’m being difficult, I’ll try to toughen up but part of me just wants him to just pick up on things like I do and stop the “ask me” make me feel like a man, BS. I try not to get too much into gender roles but I do want someone to at least take care of me like I do them. ",0,1730214800.0,AskMenAdvice,10,0.33,False

Now, from the video, I tried to run the descale process on the unit to check if the unit was asking for a maintenance. Both '1-Cup' and '2-Cup' buttons start flashing even when getting into the descale mode. Now, the unit keeps flashing the '2-Cup' button.

I tried doing a factory reset and disconnecting it for a few minutes, but it keeps in the same state.

Any ideas whats going on?

1gewwro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gewwro/sudden_onset_of_nausea_after_italy/,Sudden Onset of Nausea After Italy,"The purpose of this post is to just seek ideas and advice on how to proceed based on the below information. There are a lot of variables, so it's difficult for me to sort everything out, so I'm posting to the collective. Some reassurance would be amazing as well.

I (42 F) was diagnosed with acute erosive gastritis 13 months ago. I was put on pantoprazole first (40x2 daily) then dexilant (60mg 1x daily). All my symptoms subsided by Jan/Feb of 2024 and by September, I had reintroduced low acid coffee and the occasional glass of wine. At that point, I began a very slow taper (60mg x 6 and 30mg x1 for two weeks, 60mg x5 and 30mg x2 for two weeks, etc.) I wasn't having any issues at all and just living a pretty normal life. October 14th, my husband and I went to Italy for our wedding anniversary (2 weeks), partaking in all of the Italian things - wine, coffee, pizza, croissants, etc. I wasn't having any issues whatsoever. 

Then my sister joined us for our last four days and she was very sick with the flu. Also, she gave us some French chocolates, which we ate too many of. The night I ate the chocolates I had reflux, but I didn't have any reflux after that one night. A day later, while driving to the airport to return to the US, I was hit with a sudden onset of extreme nausea on an empty stomach, so I ate something and it went away with no lingering symptoms. I had no problems on the flight home or the night we got home. But the following 3 days have been the same - sudden onset of extreme nausea, typically mid-day, that goes away once I eat something.  I've paused my taper at the stage I'm at (four 30mg pills, three 60 mg pills). I've added 20mg famotidine am and pm, along with sucralfate 4x a day. And I've gone back to my plain diet with no coffee/wine, etc. 

Obviously, I'm a little freaked out, but trying to remain calm and follow protocol. My main questions are: 

1. Should I continue my taper after giving it a week or two, assuming symptoms subside?

2. Is this nausea most likely related to chocolate, taper, flu exposure?? (I realize this is a thought exercise only, but i have to ask)

3. Have I totally fukced myself or should I be okay if I just follow the protocol and be good for a while? (Again, mainly looking for reassurance because I know we can't really know these things.)

Expected shipping is in Feb.

I am relatively new to the espresso (at least making it) scene. My current set up is a Calphalon (yes you can judge and make fun of me , it was my first time and it was on sale for $80) and a Baratza esp. So this grinder is intended to be a significant upgrade if it's all it's cracked up to be. 

I apologize for my newbie questions but, what is everything I should be testing for to determine this grinder is worth it. Primarily, is it worth 1k or is it even worth the discounted $600?

I can do an in depth review for the community when I receive it but if anyone can assist me with a list of things I should check and what I should compare it to. Should I try multiple beans? Who knows how this will go, I've heard the company does make other high quality products though. 

To pre answer the espresso machine question, I'm not sure what I will do with the Calphalon. It's like my Honda Civic, it's not a Mercedes but it's gotten me from A to B and is reliable. Maybe I'll just keep a high end grinder/low end machine just to continue to prove the ""grinder is more important"" theory. 

Thanks all and let me know if you have any questions. ",4,1730214059.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I'm from Puerto Rico, and we have a culture deeply rooted in Coffee. I have been drinking coffee since kid (Common in latino families) and through my life I keep hearing Puertorican Beans are among the best in the world. I think Arabica is only type planted here, with Typica being the main variety, but I have seen some Bourbon and Limani being cultivated, could be others I'm not aware.

The specialty coffee scene has taken a regrown interest in Puerto Rico during the last decade, but  since I started getting interested in specialty around 5 years ago, I barely hear about Puerto Rico Beans outside of the Island.

I have inquired about this with some local roasters and their answer is that the Puerto Rico Coffee production barely meets the local demand and this is why is barely exported to the rest of the world.

I consume local Coffee almost exclusively, rarely buying beans from other countries because is just easier to source here in the island.

With that said, I want to get out of the local bubble and see what other folks around the world that have tried Puerto Rico beans think about it and if it is as good as we the locals think it is specially when prepared as espresso.",3,1730213898.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

**Short version:** My group is changing, and I’m not on board. Do I leave, and how?

**Long version:** I have been playing dungeons and dragons with the same group for about 8 years. We’ve had some great fun over the years. We don’t play online, and have been doing physical sessions all the way.  
  
Info:

\-        I am not the DM

\-        We are all in our thirties

\-        We are all friends outside of the game

\-        We always drink alcoholic beverages during playing

\-        Four players + DM

We always play at my house, and I love being host. I always serve lots of meats and cheese, crakers, fruit, bread, and for our “party”sessions (like the annual christmas party session) I’ll make a feast table filled with food from the realm and appropriate drinks.  
I have made tons of playlists for different settings, made terrain and props, minifigs. I have bought presents for the other players and the dm, like theme-based notebooks, advent calendars, dice, class specific pencils (..) and so on.  
I have arranged special sessions about twice a year (like the christmas party session), which takes weeks to prepare. I make a quiz about the characters, I make lots of food, prepare costumes (nothing too big, but typically a cloak and a sword for everyone), and I fill my dining room with every sword, skull, bow and dagger I can find.  
I do all of this because I want to and because I like it. I really enjoy cooking, organizing, and I have always loved dressing up, fantasy and arts and crafts. It is my contribution to making our game more visual and interactive; the kind of dnd game I want to play.

We played our first campaign over four years from level 1 to level 20, and it was so much fun. We really got to know each others characters, and the story tied beautifully together. The perfect campaign, I’d say.

  
We started a second campaign after that. I spent a lot of time writing down every bit of information the DM gave us and made a compendium of every city complete with every person we had met or heard of, and the day after every session I’d send everyone a detailed recap of the events. I really went all in and wanted to correct some of my shortcomings from the first campaign.

The dm and another player both became parents (not together) shortly after starting the new campaign, and one player moved to a different city. A few new players joined our table at this point, and we experienced a bit of turbulence. The new players had different playstyles from us, and there were several (calm) discussions about what kind of game we wanted to play. Some of the players (myself included) had much less fun playing, and the atmosphere wasn’t always great. The dm then started cancelling sessions on short notice, and after about half a year of this I decided to invite him for coffee to have a chat. We talked about what we could do to change the situation and decided to go back to basics playerwise, and that the DM would take a break for as long as he needed. The campaign ended, and we politely asked the new players to leave the group.

Two of the original players decided to pick up the DM mantle. One made a short campaign we could play while the other worked on a longer one. We started playing again. The second and longer campaign started, and it’s the one we’re currently playing.

It’s been increasingly hard to schedule sessions, and the new campaign started in June. It’s the end of October, and we’ve played two sessions. Grown-up work schedules and kids makes it hard to find dates that works for everyone, and I have been working my ass off make the group send me their “can/cannot” dates.

We’re lucky if we get to play once a month now. And when we finally get to play, it is painfully clear to me that something has changed. It feels not as serious as it used to, it seems like a race to be the funniest one. Lots of “funny” characters and doing “funny” stuff. Silly voices, word play names, no backstories and so on. I don’t hate funny characters (and I usually really love word play), and playing like this for oneshots from time to time is not an issue. But this is all we do now, and I’m not having fun. It feels like our sessions have gone from semi-serious high fantasy to “a night off from the kids/girlfriend and I’m gonna get drunk and make jokes and kill npcs”.

All of the stuff I usually would enjoy preparing to make our sessions magical feels useless now. All the work in between sessions is useless, like recaps and compendiums. The group used to love my efforts, but something has changed during the last years. What used to be my favourite hobby is now something I maybe get to do once a month, and spending time making stuff for our sessions has become redundant.  

It seems like the rest of the group is having the time of their life while playing. I spend most sessions trying to play along, but I am starting to realize that there may be some truth in “no dnd is better than bad dnd”.

 Now, I know I’m the problem here. I am a firm believer in “nothing gets better if you don’t talk about it”, and I have voiced several issues over the years. This is different, as I am the only one who doesn’t like the way we play now. I want something different, and I don’t want to push them into doing things “my way”. I get it – not everyone cares about things like finding joy in using information you wrote down two years ago, knowing which deity your character follows or dressing up as an elf.

Unfortunately, I think the group is going to split if I leave. We always play at my place, and it’s impossible to play anywhere else (for different reasons, but trust me – there are very, very few options). Even though it sounds like they are losing interest in playing, they really love it. One of them just bought a deck of many things, and they always flood the group chat with “I’m excited”-texts when it’s time to play.

It’s also quite safe to say that I’ll be quitting dnd if I leave. I live in a small city in a small country with no dnd community. I have tried playing online, but it’s not for me.

 

This is where I seek advice: what do I do?

Should I stay, hoping that things will change once life is a bit easier?

Should I leave the group?

Is no dnd really better than bad dnd?

Have any of you been through this? Your group changing and you not being on board? How did you deal with it?

How do I quit the group without hurting any feelings?

1gewloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1gewloo/gastritis_virtually_gone_after_5_years/,Gastritis Virtually Gone After 5 Years ,"My gastritis symptoms started in 2019. After a trip to the emergency room and visits to several specialists, I was able to temporarily ""cure"" it with over-the-counter pantoprazole.

But it came back in 2020. Pantoprazole helped me manage the symptoms, but I had to increasingly up my dose and ended up maxing out at 80Mgs/day.

I tried everything to cure it - drinking cabbage and potato juice, quitting smoking and drinking alcohol, no more coffee, and switching to a hardcore non-inflammatory diet.

Nothing worked. H. Pylori tests came up negative. There was nothing wrong with my gallbladder.

Three years later I was still in constant pain and maxed out on pantoprazole.

A couple months ago, I explained my symptoms to a general practitioner and asked her for a referral to a gastro specialists. Her response: ""Why? They are just going to tell you what I told you: You just have to manage the symptoms and live with it.""

Unbelievable.

So I decided to give self-healing one last big push. It worked and I still cannot believe it. Just want to share what I did because it might help others.

Here is what I did for the **first month of recovery**:

**1. Began taking Intestinal Fortitude (IF) supplements**.  
This, I believe, was the game-changer. I have absolutely no affiliation with this company but I do think people should know about their supplements. I recommend buying their ""Reduce, Repair, Rebuild"" bundle and taking it as they advise on their website.

I also began taking IF's prebiotics - one dose in the morning and another before bed.

**2. Cut out all alcohol, carbonated drinks, coffee, and even tea**  
Instead, I drank:

* Water
* Fresh fruit and vegetable juice that I made at home (I'll explain this in detail below).
* No-sugar-added almond milk-based smoothies with plant-based protein powder, bananas, spinach, and frozen strawberries and blueberries.
* For a treat, I would drink GT's Mushroom Elixir Soda. It's about $3.75/bottle, but I felt justified in having one of these every day. This does have caffeine in it and it is slightly carbonated, but it never hurt my stomach, even when I was beginning the diet.

**3. Cut out refined carbs and processed foods (things like white bread, flour, pasta)**

**4. Cut out smoking and vaping**  
Most people know smoking impedes healing, but I was one of those people who convinced himself that vaping was OK. Not so much. This time around, I completely gave up vaping. If you have chronic gastritis like I do/did, my gut tells me you've just got to give this bad habit up.

**5. Went to a virtually all-liquid diet for a month (this is extreme and may not be necessary for others)**  
My gastritis symptoms were terrible, and I imagine that I did a lot of damage to my stomach lining over the course of four years.

To give my stomach a break, I drastically changed my diet for **one month**. Here's what the diet looked like:

* I started each morning with Intestinal Fortitude supplements and a big glass of water with two scoops of the company's L-Glutamine powder.
* I bought a juice maker on Amazon for $40. Whenever I was hungry throughout the day, I would make fresh juice. Typically, I made it with one large beet, one large apple, a huge chunk of fresh ginger, and three big carrots.
* For lunch, I would eat a big handful of unsalted cashews, a big apple, and a big smoothie. Then I would repeat my fresh juice routine throughout the day.
* For dinner, I ate the same thing every single day: Baked salmon with salt, pepper, and lemon, a small sweet potato, and either cous cous or rice. I realize there are many other non-inflammatory foods out there, but I stuck with what sat well on my stomach.
* I never ate dinner after 6:00 p.m. so that food did not sit on my stomach while I slept.
* With dinner, I always took digestive enzymes (any brand should do)

**6. Talked to my doctor about anxiety**  
I've struggled with anxiety my entire life. A few months ago, my doctor put me on a low dose of anti-anxiety medication. How does this connect to gastritis recovery? I'm not sure, but I do know that extreme anxiety can trigger gut health issues. It may be possible that taming my anxiety helped in my recovery.

I'm now about two months into recovery and have only taken pantoprazole four times. Most days I am completely symptom-free. But I am also VERY careful about what I eat and drink.

I am still on a full regimen of Intestinal Fortitude supplements, and most days I stick to smoothies, fresh vegetable juice, fresh fruits, nuts, eggs, rice, and a nice fish dinner.

Once a week, I will ""cheat"" and go out to dinner at a local diner for a feta cheese omlette with hash browns, toast, and Diet Pepsi (humble pleasures, indeed). But the rest of the time, I am very, very strict about what I eat.

Not saying this is the only path to recovery. Just saying it worked for me when I'd given up hope!",4,1730213784.0,Gastritis,13,0.83,False

My case is a bit rare or weird I don't know. 

I suffered from a lot of anxiety and panic attacks in the past. I have cardophobia too. I had adrenaline rushes all the time which were scary. I took escitalopram during one year and stopped one year and a half ago.
Since then I dont feel these rushes anymore. I feel flat and with no emotion you know. I miss there adrenaline rushes actually. I feel I could control them now.... 
Something weird is when I take coffee..... My heart does not pound strong I dont feel it. It is like a sensation of emptiness in chest. Many aspects of my emotions and feelings are dead: lower smell, lower taste, feeling sleepy all the time, no libido, no skin sensitivity.... 

My question is : is someone suffered from the same condition and Bupropion gave him or her back these rushes and energy? Did it give back to you emotions and feelings?

1gewf95,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1gewf95/m4f_a_twin_peaks_and_disco_elysium_inspired/,[M4F] A Twin Peaks and Disco Elysium inspired murder mystery,"Henry turned the engine off and sighed. Everything about this was suboptimal to say the least. He was on his first major investigation, he lacked a partner, and this investigation would take place in one of the most rural parts of the state. Not only that, but due to “policy” he had to take a civilian car to take him here, which meant that he arrived in his own rusty old brown el camino from the 80s. Back in his precinct he usually took the police cars for personal travels as well. He was too good to be reprimanded by his chief for a miniscule off-the-books infringement like that. Nonetheless he was here and had a job to do. His cold hand took his glasses, which had fogged up by now, and stashed them deep in the inside pockets of his dark grey wool coat. 

The parking lot he stepped out into was the same as in any other slowly dying former boom town. A rundown motel, broken neon signs, trash, the usual really. After adjusting himself to the light rain and cold temperatures he made his way over towards the motel’s entrance. He stepped inside, slicking back his slightly wet dark brown medium long hair, finding himself in a small reception room with lighting that was already starting to give him a headache. Suddenly a sharp ringing cut through the air after Henry had hit the “ring here” bell to notify some staff to come to the reception desk. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen, that was until the door through which he had entered opened behind him.

“You’re the detective, aren’t you?”

The woman behind him seemed to be a local police officer. She wore the typical sheriff’s uniform, with a dusty brown leather jacket, paired with black uniform pants and the usual bravado of someone with authority. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am. Special Agent Henry Neal.” 

He supressed the urge to show his badge. For some reason he still was usually assuming that no one would believe him to be a police officer.

“Good. I’m deputy Riley Harper. Come on, Jennifer won’t be here for another hour, she’s out for a drink or two, well, maybe five…”

Henry followed the deputy across the road, past some old shops and to a small diner. It looked like every stereotypical American diner you could imagine. Inside she sat down with him at one of the tables and took off her jacket, just as a waitress approached her.

“Hello there Riley!” 

The woman who was probably in her 40s greeted the deputy with a warm smile on her face.

“What can I bring you today?”

She looked at Henry and her smile turned more into a smirk.

“And the handsome fellow you brought with yourself?”

“Stop…”

Clearly the deputy felt embarrassed by this interaction, though she was “saved” by a strong raspy voice coming from the counter.

“Oy, Sally.” An older man with little to no hair aside from his thick grey beard stood behind the counter with his arms crossed.
“We don’t serve that kinda folk round ‘ere.” His comment clearly was targeted towards Henry.

“Listen, I just need a coffee with milk for myself and one to go for the chief.” The deputy said and smiled.

“Coming right up!” The waitress answered and left for the counter.

“So…” the deputy faced Henry, “You’re probably here for the hanged man aren’t you?”

He looked at her, actually having heard that the murder victim had been hanged for the first time just now.

“Yes, exactly.”

I knew many of these stories we hear on reddit about heartbreaks and anything that instills hate and rage in us are mostly just fake but I had no idea there are literal businesses running that make up such stories to fuel public hatred and anger. 

There are people sitting around and cashing in on our emotions and creating lies after lies every day, multiple times, enough to make you turn against another or a group as a whole.

So many people truly believe the stories that they come across, I have believed so many such stories too. Especially when it comes as video contents like reels and shorts, it's sticks to your mind and becomes a reality. 

Be careful about what you believe in, things aren't as terrible as we think them to be. Don't let your emotions overcome your logical judgement. 

The example sample this job poster gave is a bad one as it pretty obviously looks like a rage bait but either way, imagine the number of people working to create such stories daily. Atleast 8 out of 10 stories will turn out believable and we buy that. 

Being PAID to write stories that spread hatred so casually when so many have access to the internet is crazyy.

Bacon, eggs (fried, scrambled, poached, or boiled), sausages, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, toast, black pudding, hash browns, and a cup of tea or coffee — each of these ingredients hails from different corners of the globe, enjoyed on their own for centuries. Yet, when brought together, they create the English breakfast. Why? Because over time, Englishmen experimented, refining what combinations worked best. Eventually, this specific assortment emerged, nothing more, nothing less. Its appeal lies not just in the balance of flavors, but in its presentation — and, crucially, in the fact that people embraced it as tradition.

The same can be said about the Sunday Roast (Third picture). Roast meat, roast chicken, yorkshire pudding, roasted and boiled vegetables (such as carrots, parsnips, peas, green beans, and sometimes cauliflower cheese), gravy, stuffing, and condiments such as horseradish sauce, mint sauce, apple sauce or bread sauce.

What can we learn from this? 

Puri, upma, idli, chutney, sambar, halwa, bora, channa tarkari, khatta, aloo bhaja, and aloo chop — let me know if I’ve missed anything or added something mistakenly — are all savored together in a carefully curated combination that I believe originated in Berhampur (correct me if I am wrong) before spreading across Odisha. Some may argue it’s merely a collection of various regional Indian dishes, but I beg to differ. Though they may share names with dishes from other regions, they are prepared in uniquely distinct ways and served in a unique combination, making the Berhampur variety its own tradition. 

So why is it an Odia tradition? Because it’s been patronized by the people of Odisha. We just need to own it and be proud of it.

The fact that tea originated in China, coffee in Yemen or Ethiopia, and tomatoes in the Americas doesn’t make the English breakfast any less English. What defines it isn’t where the ingredients came from, but how they were brought together, refined, and embraced as part of English culinary tradition. Similarly, a dosa might have originated in Tamil Nadu but it is just as Kannad or Malayalee or Telugu as it is Tamil.

If our tradition were marketed as the ""Odia Breakfast"" — or any other name, for that matter — there's real potential for success. But first, we need to address two key points. Experts and professionals must come together and, through the process of deliberation, clearly define what exactly constitutes a Odia Breakfast, from the dishes to the details. After all, consensus building is important. 

Second, the presentation needs improvement. I understand why it's, as some would call it, ""messy"" — it is because customers prioritize quick service over aesthetics. However, if we aim to export this tradition, we have to start paying attention to how it looks. Unless, of course, we find a way to make the messiness appealing, much like New York’s ""Garbage Plate"" has done (I will leave it to you to google the dish, it actually tastes great!). 

I say this as someone who personally enjoys the rustic, chaotic charm of our breakfast combo, but I’m trying to be pragmatic and realistic here, particularly from a marketing standpoint.

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

1gew7cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cptsd_bipoc/comments/1gew7cc/was_i_bullied_by_my_white_colleague/,Was I bullied by my white colleague?,"I work in a school, but a lot of minorities (arabic, black) I am a black teacher myself and I am from a working-class area too (not the same as my pupils). A white and direct colleague of mine (she is also an English teacher) who I only have professional conversations with almost, who I had drinks with once or twice with other colleagues as part of the group but never a one-to-one thing,  knew my closeness with a former pupil of her from 10 years ago, I don't care how but she knew. She bumped into him at his work (he is a waiter in a restaurant) and you guess they had this common conversation when a teacher meets his former pupil etc, he asked who was still working there among the teachers he had, and she mentioned that I was working there too, while I wasn't obviously a teacher 10 years ago when I was 20....she wanted to talk about ""us"" and she told him ""now that you know Nelly, you must have some files about us, the teachers, like you know Mr P and I have never been a couple as you always thought? Mr P is actually our colleague and a very close friend of her and me as well but they have been great friends for years and pupils thought they were a couple.  . Mr P is a colleague that I really appreciate, very funny, smart and he comes to mine for drinks (unlike her), I could tell he was a friend! And the most important part..... He is gay. Here is where the drama starts. My colleague who I will call Karen asked many questions to my very close friend and former pupil of her to find out if he knew about Mr P's sexual orientation, she quizzed him according to him with intrusive questions to make him say that Mr P was gay so he felt like trapped. She then went and said Mr P that he was endangered because I outed him. She never came to me to tell me that she encountered with my friend, she directly went seeing Mr P. So, someone who doesn't know me as a person, barely used to ask me how I was today, who never came to my place or had a simple coffee at work with me at all, was confortable enough to talk about me outside the school but not enough to tell me about her meeting with my friend. 

Now the topic of his homosexuality did intervene once in our conversation because we were talking about homophobia at school and I learned from my friend that Mr P was identified as a gay and had been laughed once but behind his back and I said to my friend ""I hope you didn't take part into that and never made him feel bad about his sexual orientation"". So, in a way, I admitted that he was gay but the conversation was innocent, respectful, and beyond everything....private. We had never talked about that anymore. I never felt the need of telling him to keep this private. He had never told that to anyone and in ten years, many of his nephews, nieces, went to this same school and he always talked about Mr P as the best teacher, that's it. 

I felt like my colleague was wicked in the way she behaved. It was so easy to make him say what she wanted him to say and she took advantage of the fact that he is a black adult living supposedly in a poor area known for homophobia....

I have been hating my colleague since this moment because I felt like she confiscated my private life to do whatever she wants with it. She sent Mr P to go and reach me to give him explanations, I admitted that it did intervene in our conversation, I was very honest, he has never been angry against me, wanted to be sure that my friend didn't have any bad intentions but I have been hating my colleague since.  Never once we (Karen and I talked about it) since she saw my friend, got the info she wanted, talked to Mr P, Mr P came and talked to me....I knew she met my friend only thanks to Mr P....she eventually realized I was angry and she owned me explanations so she eventually sent me a message that I would qualify patronizing "" Nelly,  I am reaching you because you must be wondering what's going on, I met Y* and I talked about you and I told Mr P about what he knows about him...we can talk about it if you want"". Like you want to educate me about discriminations and explain to me what I did wrong? As a black woman I know too much about discriminations, I don't need any lessons from you about how to deal with that.

I’m not asking for funding here, I hope to gather support for this vision. Community involvement is crucial; I encourage anyone interested to consider volunteering or sharing this idea with others who might want to contribute.

I’m reaching out to share something very personal. I lost my dad to dementia, a journey that profoundly changed our family. One of my fondest memories is of our afternoons spent at the park, where he would light up at the sight of birds and enjoy a simple picnic with me. Living in Queensland, I’ve been inspired by those moments, and I want to create more like them for families like ours.

I envision a safe, welcoming space where families can enjoy quality time with their loved ones living with dementia. Imagine a beautiful area where they can stroll freely, sit together for a picnic, watch fish swim in a serene pond, enjoy a warm cup of coffee, and listen to the cheerful songs of birds—all within a secure environment.

This space would be enclosed, providing peace of mind for caregivers. Even if someone looks away for a moment or feels the urge to wander, they would remain safe, with fencing ensuring they can't leave without their carer. Staff members would be present, ready to lend a helping hand and offer support whenever needed.

To enhance this experience, we could include memory gardens filled with fragrant plants, art and music therapy sessions, and quiet zones for relaxation. Group activities, like gentle exercise classes and games, could foster social interaction and connection.

I’d like to name this initiative ""DAN""—the Dementia Activity Network. This name reflects the spirit of connection and community I want to foster. I dream of a place where caregivers can say, “Let’s go to DAN,” creating a sense of belonging and comfort for everyone involved.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Together, we can create a meaningful space for our loved ones and their caregivers, where moments of joy can flourish amidst the challenges of dementia.

Warm regards,

Looking for a toothpaste that does it all? I've been using Colgate Total Whitening lately, and I'm impressed with its multi-tasking abilities.

This toothpaste tackles a bunch of dental issues at once. It helps with sensitive teeth while also making them whiter. I noticed my teeth felt cleaner after just a few brushings. The minty flavor leaves my mouth feeling fresh too.

https://preview.redd.it/rfyfxzw0ipxd1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe2abdc10b1b2be8b3f84dccb759f6e22ab177ed

I like that it's made without sugar or gluten. The four-pack is handy - I keep tubes in different bathrooms. It's nice not having to buy toothpaste as often.

While it may not whiten as fast as some pricier options, I think it's a good value for a toothpaste that does so much.

# Bottom Line

Colgate Total Whitening is a solid choice if you want a toothpaste that tackles multiple dental needs at once.

It cleans well, helps with sensitivity, and gradually whitens teeth.



# Overview of Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste

I've been using Colgate Total for a while now, and I'm impressed. This toothpaste packs a punch with 10 benefits in one tube. It's great for sensitive teeth like mine, offering more relief than regular fluoride options.

The whitening effect is noticeable. I drink coffee daily, and this paste helps keep stains at bay. After brushing, my mouth feels fresh and clean. The mint flavor is pleasant without being too strong.

I appreciate that it's sugar-free and gluten-free. The antibacterial protection is a nice bonus for overall mouth health.

While it's not a miracle worker, I find it effective for everyday use. The 4-pack is handy for stocking up. If you're looking for a solid all-around toothpaste with whitening benefits, I think Colgate Total is worth trying.

# Multifaceted Oral Health Benefits

I was impressed by how this toothpaste tackles multiple oral health issues at once. It offers sensitivity relief that really works - I noticed less pain when eating cold foods after a few weeks of use. The whitening effect is subtle but noticeable, gradually removing surface stains from my teeth. I also appreciate the antibacterial protection, which helps keep my mouth feeling clean throughout the day. The mint flavor is refreshing without being overpowering. While it's not a miracle product, I found it to be a solid all-around toothpaste that addresses several common dental concerns effectively.

# Effective Stain Removal

I've been using this Colgate Total Whitening toothpaste for a while now, and I'm impressed with its stain-fighting power. As a daily coffee drinker, I was worried about teeth discoloration. But this toothpaste has kept my smile bright. It tackles surface stains well, leaving my teeth noticeably whiter. The mint flavor is refreshing and makes my mouth feel clean. While it may not be the strongest whitener out there, it's a solid choice for the price. I've found it works best with consistent use. My teeth look brighter, and I feel more confident smiling.

# Sensitivity Relief

I found this Colgate toothpaste really helped with my tooth sensitivity. After using it for a couple of months, I noticed I could enjoy hot and cold foods without wincing. The formula seems to work well, offering more relief than regular toothpastes I've tried before. It's nice to have a product that tackles sensitivity while also whitening and cleaning. I appreciate that I don't have to choose between comfort and other benefits. The mint flavor is pleasant and leaves my mouth feeling fresh. While it may not be a miracle cure for extreme sensitivity, I think it's a solid choice for daily use to manage mild to moderate tooth discomfort.

# Refreshing Mint Flavor

I love the crisp, clean mint flavor of this Colgate Total toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and tingly after brushing. The minty taste isn't too strong or overpowering, but it's enough to make my breath feel fresh for hours. I've tried other mint toothpastes that were too harsh, but this one strikes a nice balance. The flavor helps motivate me to brush thoroughly twice a day. My only small complaint is that I wish the mint taste lasted a bit longer after brushing. Still, I find the refreshing mint flavor to be one of the best things about using this toothpaste regularly.

# Antibacterial Protection

I was impressed by the antibacterial protection this toothpaste offers. The stannous fluoride in the formula fights harmful bacteria in my mouth. After brushing, my teeth feel clean and my breath stays fresh longer. I noticed less plaque buildup over time compared to regular toothpastes. The protection seems to last throughout the day, even after meals. This feature gives me peace of mind about my oral health between dentist visits. While the antibacterial effects are great, the mint flavor is a bit strong for my taste. Still, I think the benefits outweigh this small issue for most people looking to improve their oral care routine.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste for a while now, and I've got some thoughts to share. Let's break it down:

# Pros

* The sensitivity relief is real. My teeth feel less sensitive after using this for a few weeks.
* It does a good job at removing surface stains. My coffee habit is no match for this toothpaste.
* The mint flavor is fresh and leaves my mouth feeling clean.
* It's a great value. Getting four tubes in one pack saves me trips to the store.
* The fluoride and antibacterial protection make me feel like I'm taking good care of my teeth.

# Cons

* While it whitens, it's not as powerful as some specialized whitening products.
* The taste might be too strong for some people. It took me a few days to get used to it.
* The tubes can be a bit hard to squeeze when you're trying to get the last bit out.

I like that this toothpaste offers multiple benefits without making me choose between whitening and sensitivity relief. It's become my go-to for daily brushing. The price is right, especially when I catch it on sale during Amazon deals.

One thing to note: if you're looking for dramatic whitening results, you might need to pair this with other whitening products. But for everyday use and maintenance, it does the job well.

# Customer Feedback

I've been using this Colgate Total Whitening toothpaste for a while now, and I'm impressed. Many users praise its effectiveness in cleaning teeth and preventing stains. As a coffee drinker, I appreciate how it helps keep my smile bright. The taste is pleasant, and my teeth feel squeaky clean after brushing. Some people noted it's not the strongest whitener out there, but it's a solid choice for the price. Users with sensitive teeth found relief, which is a big plus. A few dentists even recommend it for its fluoride content. Most buyers agree it's a good value, especially when bought in bulk.

# Conclusion

After using Colgate Total Whitening for a while, I'm impressed. This toothpaste lives up to its promises. My teeth feel cleaner and look brighter. It's gentle on sensitive teeth too. The mint flavor is fresh without being overpowering. While it may not be the strongest whitener out there, it does a good job for the price. I like that it offers multiple benefits in one product. The four-pack is a great value. If you want an all-around good toothpaste that cleans well and helps with whitening, this is a solid choice. I plan to keep using it as part of my daily routine.",1,1730212526.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

Opened a small coffee shop a few months ago and am wanting to upgrade my Baratza Encore.

I was initially also considering a Timemore 078, or a 1Zpresso hand grinder. 
078 is probably out of the budget for now so I decided on an Ode 2 with stock burrs for ease of dialing and decided to nix the hand grinder. 

Then I stopped by a shop recently and saw they were using a Comandante C40 for pour over and that got me thinking about hand grinders again! 😅 

I’m not the most seasoned pour over barista but I’ve been practicing a lot over these months and used to do quite a few at home in years past. (albeit not with a great grinder ha ha)

I’m kind of bringing specialty coffee to my community for the first time, so I had decided on a stock burr ode 2. I figure that cup profile would be the most universally enjoyed around here. Comandante looks interesting but I’m not sure about a hand grinder for the shop.

I can access self hosted applications while away from home just by using the applications local network address without even having to install Tailscale on that particular device/application by using —advertise-routes=192.169.1.0/24. 

The small issue I have Is that if the network I use when away from home uses the same local subnet as I do at home, (in my case 192.168.1.0/24). Then for example if I access 192.168.1.1 I would receive the login page for the router of the place I’m visiting rather than my own router login. I can get round this by turning off WiFi and using mobile 4g if available. I assume this problem is because my home LAN IP range conflicts with the local IP subnet of  the hotel or coffee shop I’m visiting at the time? If this is the case then is there a way to literally force everything through the tunnel ? as in theory that would cure my problem.

sorry about the weird title, I really wasn't sure how to word it. I'm starting my first position at a very remote school next year, and I am a very anti-social person. This is due to me having autism, I'll happily talk with co-workers while at work, or answer work related questions via email or phone. However, while I can handle social interactions at work, it is extremely tiring and I have no interest in being friends with co-workers or hanging out with them outside of work. 

  
I've read a lot online about how in remote communities apparently all teachers are friends and hang out outside of worker, and a big thing is teachers doing after school drinks apparently. While I have no problem with other people drinking personally I do not, and do not feel comfortable around others drinking alcohol or being in a bar. At one of my last jobs in OSHC we got sent a email saying we had to attend a Christmas get together at a local pub, and I was super worried about it and stressed out, however thankfully I ended up leaving that job before the get together.  I'm also vegan and once again others can eat whatever they want, however personally I follow a vegan diet and I'm concerned about workplace bullying, and the potential social aspects to these things.

I would love if it never came up however, at my last job it got pointed out that every lunch I brought was vegan after a while, and my one of my co-workers would talk about it a lot, asking why I always eat a salad, and other comments about what I bought for lunch everyday. The same thing goes with coffee and tea, I personally do not consume them and at my last job it was the same thing, with my co-workers constantly pointing it out. At my last job my age (I went to university very young so I'm younger than people assume), and the fact I don't drive were also brought up a lot. These things may seem odd however, they do make me apparently different from the general population, and I've had to deal with borderline bullying regarding my life choices at my last job.

  
In regards to the social aspects I'm not sure how to get out of it. It is not my intention to be rude, however I do not want to be friends with my co-workers. And I'm concerned about end of year get together events, which typically take place in pubs, I do not want to be apart of any end of year get together. Just to be clear I'm talking about get together completely unrelated to work. I'm hoping some people can share their experiences and advice on this.",2,1730211986.0,AustralianTeachers,2,1.0,False

their merchandise having nearly all been sold

I'm confused by the participle. Smyth 453-454 discusses the fact that ἐμπολάω comes from a compound noun ἐμπολή, and therefore the augment doesn't split it into ἐνεπολα- in the imperfect. LSJ gives the perfect middle as ἐξημπόλημαι, which makes sense, because the reduplication comes before the second preposition, in the same way that Smyth describes for the augment.

So far so good. But then the form that Herodotus uses looks like it's had its reduplication removed. Why is that? When I first looked at ἐξημπόλημαι, my brain saw the η as an augment, and then it would make sense that you would not use the augment when forming the participle. But it's not an augment, it's a reduplication, so why isn't the participle ἐξημπολημένων? E.g., for ἐρέφω, I think the perfect participle would be ἠρεμμένος (that's what Wiktionary lists), not ἐρεμμένος.

1gevt0g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gevt0g,Dark spot found on the side of my molar with a filling - cavity or stain?,"I was brushing my teeth last night and noticed this dark spot on my molar. I've been to the dentist about 6 times over the course of the last 7 months to get a LOT of fillings as I did a significant damage to my teeth during college via drinking/smoking/sugar/stress. 

However since getting all my fillings, I've been extremely diligent with brushing with an electric toothbrush twice a day, flossing one/two times a day, and occasionally using floride mouthwash. I smoke extremely rarely and drink infrequently, and in general have been limiting my sugar intake. I do drink a lot of coffee and tea.

When I probe the spot it doesn't hurt, and there doesn't appear to be a pit or indent, could it just be staining? There's one or two other spots with similar looking dark marks where there is also a white composit filling. I use to have silver fillings, and if my memory serves me correctly there did used to be one in this partitular tooth. This filling couldn't be more then 2 months old as it was one of the last to be done.

Not too long ago, I went to Tim Horton's in my area by myself for a coffee since I had gotten the motivation and actual will to leave my home more often. 

I went to sit down after getting my drink and took my phone out to occupy myself before I see a single guy sitting at the other side of the café, on a couch with his hot coffee cup on the coffee table in front of him. He had curly black hair with a black mustache, wearing a black jacket and jeans. He looked lonely, like he was sulking a bit. I didn't realize I kept staring, and I felt bad so I got up with my drink to sit next to him.

""You alright?""

""I am, thank you.""

""Okay. You looked sad so I wanted to make sure you were.""

There was an awkward pause, and he shifted himself to face me a bit.

""I just lost my mom two days ago, that's all.""

""I'm sorry about that. How are you doing then?""

""I'm okay. She was a heavy drinker.""

I just nodded and offered my condolences. So after a couple seconds of silence, I spoke up again.

""I'm really sorry. I wish you the best.""

""Thanks. She wasn't particularly good. I mean, she hit me and whatever growing up and called me many things but it was the 80s.""

""So she was abusive?""

""Yeah. I'd say I'm hurt she's gone but also glad. But she was my mom.""

""I know, I'm sorry. It's hard because she had you and raised you but treated you badly. It's confusing.""

The dude went silent and grabbed his coffee before he sipped it. I decided to talk again.

""I was raised by a bad mom too, so I understand. I'm very sorry.""

He looked at me and went:

""Oh yeah? How does she treat you?""

""She's toxic and competitive.""

""Sorry to hear.""

I politely smiled and waved my hand at him. We kept talking, and he opened up to me about his mom. He said his mom was an alcoholic who'd treat him terribly, sober or not. His situation wasn't identified as easily since it was the 80s and domestic violence/mental health wasn't really mainstream. So I opened up too to him about my own. We were comparing our situations and asking each other te differences as he was a son and I was a daughter to an abusive mother. 

I don't know how long it lasted, but it felt nice. This was the final conversation before he left the coffee shop.

He said:

""You're mentally beyond your years, kid. It's impressive but also sad since that's the outcome of a bad household.""

So I look at him with an awkward stare before it became more ""softer"" and a little vulnerable. I think he noticed, because he spoke up about it.

""What were you? The scapegoat or what?""

""Both that and golden child.""

""Oh so you know how it feels like for both sides.""

I nodded in the affirmative, and he said something.

""I never thought I'd meet someone young this understanding and wise. I'm a grown man becoming soft because of you.""

And we laughed. He left shortly after. It felt oddly good being able to empathize with someone much older who experienced something similar. I doubt he and I will run into each other again in the future but he was one damn cool guy.

Seller review - Had a nice experience with u/decantosaurus. I'm from Ladakh and getting a parcel here is kind of stretch but she did everything nicely and the package was well packed.

Perfume review - Writing this after using all of them for a week.

Asad - Got to know that it's was a clone of dior     sauvage. It's was nice and calming. 7/10

French coffee - Smell's exactly like a coffee toffee which I don't remember the name of. If you want to smell like a sweet coffee this is for you. 7/10

Ameer al oud - I like it. It has nice incense smell which gives me a monastery feeling. 8.5/10

Khamrah qahwa - Ok this one is so good. And what is this longevity and projection, I can smell it on me next day also. This one for me is easily 10/10

Sadness -
Choco musk - Broke my choco musk while taking pictures for this review. Perfume was nice, smell's like oreo biscuit. 7/10. Plus point here is my room smell like oreo biscuit now.

How are guys handling their dating life?,"For context, I have never had a girlfriend. I've kind of dated on and off, but never got past a few dates. I'm an above average looking guy (I think, but based on my dating history, maybe I'm actually far below), in good shape, and pretty tall. I often get unprompted compliments about my physique from other guys. I check all those boxes on paper, but I have no self confidence. 

I recently matched with this girl on bumble and we went on a casual coffee date. I thought it went really well, and when I suggested going out again, some place more intimate, she was very excited and said ""let's do it!"" Told her to text me when she got back home, and the next day asked her what days worked for her for the second date. She told me, and I planned out this whole thing based on something she said during the date and asked her if the time and place worked. And she's ghosted me since. 

I get it, people change their minds, things happen, and I'm just bummed because we had so much in common. I have been on a few dates or talked to people here and there but the last time I was this excited about someone was over 10 years ago. But this isn't about her, it's more about me. Given how hard it is to even meet someone, I don't even know how to get better at this. How are guys in my age demographic  meeting women? My hobbies are all male dominated, and I rarely if ever, meet women I'm attracted to in my daily life. 

I'm pretty content in my own life and fairly happy single. I have a small friend circle that I'm close to. But the lonely nights are getting more frequent and more difficult to get through. People often say get your life together, get in shape, get a good career, get into some hobbies. In my experience, I either have all that or and making good progress, but none of it has moved the needle at all in my favor. How are single men my age going about their dating life?

I am considering the Beko CEG3192B. The price is only 3481nok and from what I understand it is basically the same machine as the SMEG BCC02 which costs 2-3 times as much. From a taste perspective I am willing to give the Beko a try but I am concerned about cleaning the machine. I found reviews of the Beko on amazon and one user posted some rather disturbing pictures of mold build-up inside the machine. I was wondering if anyone here have experience with cleaning this machine or its siblings to keep the mold in check. Is it manageable or do you have to disassemble the whole thing to get access?

We’re aiming for this trip within the next year and I’d appreciate any recommendations for kid-friendly activities, accommodations, and tour guides.
Key Considerations:
* Line Management: My son struggles with waiting in long lines, so I plan to book everything in advance.
* Personalized Tours: We’re looking for one-on-one tour guides who can accommodate his needs and preferences.
* Active Schedule: He thrives on a structured, busy itinerary and can fixate on specific interests.
Ideal Location:
We’d like to stay in an area with easy access to public transportation, pharmacies, and breakfast/coffee shops. I’ve considered a Marriott vacation package for convenience, but I’m also open to finding an Airbnb if I can get good recommendations on suitable neighborhoods.

Activities I Think He’d Enjoy:
* Catacombs
* Versailles
* Louvre
* Eiffel Tower
* French cooking class
* Chocolate food tour

Additional Help:
If you have suggestions for tour companies, dining options, or experiences that would be engaging for a history-loving child, I would greatly appreciate it!
Thank you in advance for your insights!
