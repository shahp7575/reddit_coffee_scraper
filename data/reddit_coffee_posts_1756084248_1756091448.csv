1mzfjxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1mzfjxy/dating_a_millionnaire/,Dating a millionnaire,"I 21F, was asked out by a a 28M who is a millionnaire. He made that very clear from our first meeting which was in a pretty exclusive place & he was driving a very expensive car. I didn‚Äôt act interested at all at first because i was seeing someone (he doesn‚Äôt know this) at the time but I did give him my number after he asked twice. (I only mention his net worth because there is a big component in the dynamic, he has a huge ego & feels as though he is the prize, but he is also very busy & focused.)

Since then, he said he‚Äôs like to take me to dinner (never happened), & to a new place in my city (never happened). He also keeps saying he wants to bring me on his trips, for example we‚Äôd talk about switzerland & i would say something like ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs nice there i heard‚Äù & he would say ‚Äúill take you so you can see for yourself‚Äù. 

Eventually, I got tired of texting so I asked him to grab coffee with me after work which he agreed to. He picked me up at the train station, opened his car door for me & took me around the city. We grabbed a bite which he paid for & enjoyed our walk. 

After that event, he expressed how intrigued he was with my personality & I have to say we got along really well, i enjoyed our talk a lot. 

He then invited me to his place & we spent all afternoon talking & cooking together. We did this for three days straight. We never got intimate, only a hug to say hi & goodbye. (I‚Äôd like to mention here, he is religious & very respectful in that manner) 

He left for a business trip afterwards & I didn‚Äôt see him for 4 weeks. We talked almost every day. I did tell him i missed him. He said he did too. He kept complimenting me & showing interest in all ways. He would send me photos on his trip, interact with my story, tell me about his day etc. (he never asks about mine) 

& then he came back in our city & hasn‚Äôt texted me at all. Nothing. Last conversation was me wishing him a good flight. The last 3 days of his trip I was the only one initiating a conversation. When he replies he‚Äôs still warm, calling me love & sweetheart etc. He also takes more time to reply than before. But he hasn‚Äôt asked to see me at all. I don‚Äôt know if this is a mind game, or he‚Äôs lost interest. ",1,1756091288.0,RedPillWomen,2,1.0,False
1mzfjo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lastofuspart2/comments/1mzfjo7/weapon_swap_glitch_and_unresponsive_weapon_cross/,Weapon swap glitch and unresponsive weapon cross is really hurting my long-term No Return experience.,"Just trying to comment on two things I've experienced in over 70 hours of No Return that I haven't seen anybody talk about, which I really hope Naughty Dog fixes. Failing that, I hope I can give some advice and get some too.

I promise I'm not just whining because I died just now, it's really the cumulative effect of dying WELL over a dozen or more times to each issue. Both issues, as far as I can tell from my perspective as a layman, are related to the fact that swapping weapons/items are tied to animations and that the game is not made for twitch shooting.

First, the easy one to deal with. On PC, when you switch weapons by holding down the number key which corresponds to the weapon slot you want to swap out, if you are pressing the move forward key, the UI will let you open the weapon swap menu, but your character won't actually do it. Again - the game REGISTERS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO, but won't let you do it. This has killed me so many times, but the fix as far as I can tell is to halt for even just a brief second to swap the weapons. It's unintuitive, because the game clearly thinks you can perform the action it does not allow you to perform but works.

The second one is a real monster of an issue. Swapping weapons or items in the weapon cross does not always swap the weapons. If your character is performing a different animation, the game gets confused and, again, **SHOWS YOU SWAPPING IN THE WEAPON CROSS BUT SIMPLY DOESN'T SWAP**. Sometimes the item/weapon does swap, but takes so fucking long to do so because of the animations that I will die even though I had time to make the decision, perform the swap, and get myself in a position to perform the action, only to find that the character is still digging in their asscrack for the thing you needed thirty decades ago. Then BOOM, you're shot in the head or writhing on the floor. RUN FAILED. I just don't know what to do about it. The game is not built for the crazy situations that happens in especially No Return on Grounded. They require split-millisecond decisions, but the game doesn't DO those. I could brew a cup of fucking coffee, let my adrenaline rush fade away, and write this post in the time it takes characters (for example) to swap from a health kit to a bottle when you REALLY FUCKING NEED THEM TO!!!

How do y'all deal with these issues?

Again, not hating on the game, No Return is one of the most addictive experiences I've ever played and, failing a Factions update, is exactly what the game needed on top of completing the greatest story ever told in video gaming history.",1,1756091263.0,lastofuspart2,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Udinese vs. Hellas Verona: A Clash of Coffee-Addicted Cats and Pie-Eating Champions**  
*The 2025/26 Serie A season kicks off with a battle of regional rivals, where Udinese‚Äôs five-match winning streak faces off against Hellas Verona‚Äôs Coppa Italia ‚Äúvictory‚Äù over a team most people forgot existed. Let‚Äôs parse the odds, digest the drama, and predict who‚Äôll emerge from this midfield meat grinder.*

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You‚Äôll Actually Enjoy

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind **Udinese** as the -110 favorite (decimal odds \~1.91), while **Hellas Verona** sits at +400 (decimal \~4.35). Translating that into implied probabilities? Udinese has a **52.3% chance** to win, Verona a **22.7% chance**, and a **25% chance of a draw**. For context, those numbers are about as reliable as a politician‚Äôs promise: plausible in theory, but history suggests otherwise.

In their last five Serie A meetings, Verona has taken **two wins** and **three draws**, including a 1-0 victory in their most recent clash in March 2025. Udinese‚Äôs five-match winning streak entering this game is impressive, but it‚Äôs also the sports equivalent of a cat on a caffeine IV drip‚Äîhigh-energy, unsustainable, and likely to end with someone knocking over a lamp.

The totals market favors an **Under 2.5 goals** (-120 implied probability \~54.5%), which makes sense if we assume both teams‚Äô defenses are still figuring out how to not look like they‚Äôre playing Fortnite in slow motion.

### Digesting the News: Coppa Winners vs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve Done This Before‚Äù

Udinese, coached by Kosta Runjaic, arrives with the momentum of a coffee addict who‚Äôs just discovered espresso. Their five straight wins are a statistical marvel, but let‚Äôs be real: You can‚Äôt win five games in a row without at least one opponent mistaking your formation for a ‚Äúpark the bus and hope they fall asleep‚Äù strategy.

Hellas Verona, meanwhile, has the Coppa Italia to their name‚Äîthough their round-of-32 win over Audace Cerignola (a team with a Wikipedia page that‚Äôs basically a single sentence and a photo of a cat in a jersey) feels less li

I have eaten to accommodate this and because I don't know when to regulate intake and food is actually kind of tasty, I now I have about 60 pounds to lose.

1mzfeso,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1mzfeso/first_day_down_thoughts_and_feelings_so_far/,First Day Down! Thoughts and feelings so far.,"I just took my first shot around noon today. I was anxious and a bit apprehensive all week leading up to this but also excited. In the past I‚Äôve struggled with severe health anxiety but have managed to find coping mechanisms over time. A few years ago this would not be a possible pathway for me. 

Administering the shot freaked me out a bit, I kept false starting and just staring at my stomach lol. When I finally injected I felt absolutely nothing at all! No pain no pinch. It was a huge relief. It could not have been easier.

I braced myself for the next hour, mildly worried about sudden nausea or dizziness, things like that. But I honestly felt pretty good and dare I say slightly more energetic than I usually do. I made and drank a coffee as usual, then felt pretty hungry and made a snack plate for my first meal of the day. Had no trouble eating it. Carrots and hummus and some cheese, wheat thins and pepperoni. 

I did a couple errands and felt completely fine, got an iced coffee at Dunkin Donuts. My day was pretty normal all around and I felt overall, the same. 

I visited my Dad around dinner time and he offered to make me a burger as he was making himself one. It smelled really good but I didn‚Äôt want to eat something unhealthy and grease heavy. I felt a bit hungry while at his house but I guess less than normal. Normally I have a big appetite at night. 

Then around 9:00 I started to feel pretty tired, I‚Äôd say more than normal. I‚Äôm usually a night owl. 

When I got home I figured I should make something to eat so I made two small chicken sausage breakfast patties and two scrambled eggs. I ate most of it but as I was eating my mind was pretty blown. I wasn‚Äôt scarfing it down fast just eating methodically. I didn‚Äôt feel that frantic frenzy to eat and eat and eat, which is something I‚Äôve battled my entire life. Honestly, this is pretty wild: I couldn‚Äôt finish my plate and it wasn‚Äôt even that much food. Less than I normally eat. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs placebo, I definitely felt full way faster and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish. That NEVER happens. 

So far so good! I‚Äôm really excited to begin this journey. I‚Äôve gained and lost significant amounts of weight many times in my 35 years and this particular weight gain has made me feel unbelievably depressed. I‚Äôve been hiding from a lot of people in my life because I feel so ashamed. I worked really hard during Covid and lost 140 pounds naturally doing the keto diet, then gained most of it back. It‚Äôs super embarrassing. The past two years I‚Äôve had a looooot of brutal life events and struggles and food unfortunately has always been my #1 coping mechanism.

I feel like I made the right decision. It was an internal battle for months but now I feel more confident and less nervous. I‚Äôm excited to see some transformation by the end of 2025.

1mzfc2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1mzfc2w/valiant_lady_aug_2024_review/,Valiant Lady Aug. 20-24 Review,"Here is my honest, unsolicited review of the Valiant Lady voyage on Aug. 20-24 which went to Key West and Bimini. 

Full disclosure: This was my first cruise, so I don't have much of a frame of reference. I do have an analytical mind and tendency to rank things based on my perception of their value and enjoyability. At minimum, I hope you find this review helpful for knowing what to expect from certain aspects of the voyage should you choose to go.

Embarkation: We were in the last embarkation group. It could not have been smoother or quicker. Virgin's staff was helpful and present. Everything was explained. We got our wearable bands that served as both our wallets and our access for almost everything on the ship. Once we got to our cabin, we were greeted by one of the seemingly endless staff members who explained the room tablet system (it controls lights, television, air conditioner, you name it) and the do not disturb/housekeeping lights. 10/10 from my perspective.

Champagne Cast Off Party: Virgin has a bunch of cute names for all of its events and locations. I find it more helpful to be descriptive. Watching the ship leave Miami from Deck 16 was a blast despite the heat. Although the DJ played an interesting and energetic set (loved the use of ABBA), and the experience was maybe an 8/10 overall, there was not one square inch of pool to squeeze into, which leads me to....

The Pool and ""Hot Tubs"": This is maybe the worst thing about this ship. The pool is too small. I understand that this is a child-free cruise and nobody is swimming laps or zooming around the pool, but there is not enough space in the pool for all of the adults who want to be there to comfortably sit. My wife and I went to the pool once on the sea day and spent a comfy two hours cooling off in it, but the experience was a little overwhelming because we were packed in like sardines and there was a noticeable sheen of everyone's collective sunscreen in the water. It could have been a touch colder in my opinion, although I understand that's a matter of taste. The ""Hot Tubs"" were of course not hot in the Caribbean summer (that would be sociopathic), but they were roughly room temperature and quite comfortable when visited outside of peak hours. I got a little reading time in on Key West day after we had all returned to the ship. It was a nice liminal space moment in what was otherwise a panopticon of aural and visual stimuli. 4/10. 

The Galley: First, I cannot gush enough about how I love that Virgin does not have a buffet. I love a buffet in a pinch, but I will take freshly prepared food served to me by human hands over stale items sitting in a heating pan any day of the week. Again, Virgin gave them cutesy names but just know that each of these items I mention is not a section in a buffet, but a miniature restaurant located within the Galley (or, for Ice Cream and Pizza, mid-ship on Level 7). I love this method of serving any time food to the patrons.

Panini Press - I only had this on the final ""Breakfast Day"" of the cruise prior to disembarkation, but I enjoyed the smoked salmon toast on rye and my wife said the nutella french toast was pretty good. Good smoky flavor, big chunks of fresh-tasting salmon, nice brightness from the onion, and a good sourish bite from the rye. I was less enamored with the avocado toast where the avocado looked piped on and tasted overly acidic. My presumption is that the avocado that is unused from other ship features ends up here (there's a LOT of avocado on this ship and I am not complaining). 7/10.

Noodles - I didn't get around to this one. My wife said the ramen was really good.

Diner and Catch-all - This was both diner food that was open late into the night and whatever specialty thing they wanted to offer that day. On the second full day (Key West day), they had Indian food and it was heavenly. The spiced lamb was one of the highlights of the trip. My wife went so far as to say that it was the second best thing she had on the trip. I had an omelet here on ""Breakfast Day"" that was a little bland. Still, based on its highs I have to give this an 8/10. 

Burgers - The fries here are killer. Perfect level of crunch on a steak fry with balanced seasoning. Generally, I felt the burgers could use a stronger seasoning hand. I had to douse them in ketchup and mayo. That being said, I still made sure to eat four of the five ""burgers of the day"" that they offered over the course of our short cruise. The clear winner of these was the French Toast Burger (french toast buns, burger patty, eggs, bacon, syrup for dipping) which was the standout breakfast item from ""Breakfast Day"" at the Galley. The other three were alright if not memorable. 8/10, mainly for the fries and the French Toast Burger. 

Breads and Sweets - Throw a dart at a dartboard. That is the consistency of this place. Winners: S'mores jar (exactly what it sounds like), pork roll (pork filling in bread, elevated hot pocket), marquise (very winning and wealthy brownie). Not quite a winner, but overhated: ""Valiant Lady"" (blueberry and white chocolate twinkie with tasty shortbread bottom, would be better if there wasn't a ""cream cheesy"" taste to it, loved the pop of the blueberry jam). Losers: other items but especially the chocolate donut (this looked like a super inviting yeast chocolate glazed donut, the donut breading was Dunkin Donuts hard and the chocolate topping was so dark as to be bitter; we nearly wept at the false advertising). 6/10. 

Salad Bar - Didn't quite make this one, to our embarrassment. To be fair, Virgin does a great job of making sure that all the meals are infused with veggies and we certainly did not feel that we were lacking in vegetables throughout the cruise.

Tacos - Delicious. The fried avocado and al pastor tacos especially were amazing. The chorizo breakfast burrito was delicious as well. 9/10.

Bento - Overlooked, but killer. Great sushi even if not judged on cruise standards. The shrimp tempura and jalapeno hamachi and salmon avocado rolls were fresh and light. Whenever I was just a little hungry, this was my first stop. 10/10. 

Popsicles - Always planned on grabbing one, never made it. They also sell champagne. 

Coffee and Soda Stations - Not much to report. Good selection. My one gripe is that the juices were quite watered down. Drip coffee was amazing. I might be the only soul on the ship that did not take advantage of the premium coffee stations. They always smelled inviting and had lines. I'm a drip coffee guy, personally. N/A

Pizza - Fresh out of a traditional oven. We only availed ourselves once to try a pepperoni pie, but it was tasty and chewy and reminded us of NY style. People lined up for this one, mainly while drunk, it's Pizza of the People, open late, and immune to my criticism that it could use a little more sauce, and the sauce could be a little more robust. 8/10. 

Ice Cream - It needs to be said: THIS IS NOT GELATO. It is presented like gelato, but it is not gelato. That being said, it is tasty. I went for the sorbets mainly, mandarin being a favorite, but the classic chocolate and vanilla are winners too. I did not walk past this one while it was open without grabbing at least a scoop. 9/10.

Full Disclosure, again: My wife and I don't drink. Therefore, I am not going to be much help on the bars except to say that Dock House and On the Rocks have excellent mocktails. Drinking a pink, citrusy mocktail from the Dock House and watching Miami disappear as the sun set while lounging on the spacious and comfortable porch on the aft (back) side of the ship while cuddled up with my wife was the single most sublime moment of the entire trip. Another memorable moment from the end of the trip was listening to the Diva (Valiant Lady's resident drag queen) do her deeply personal and moving cabaret while enjoying On the Rock's take on a non-alcoholic old-fashioned. For those two moments alone, 10's across the board for Virgin's bars.

We need to talk about the Social Club.

Aesthetically, this is my favorite part of the ship. It's in a little path on Level 7 that goes down to the Wake (best restaurant, more on that later) and there is a beautiful mural, lots of elegant seating with porticos that show the ocean and our movement through it. I also love the idea of the Social Club. I was pretty happy to see the wall of board games and groups with larger parties than ours (or people who made friends on the ship) could often be seen playing games or putting together puzzles. It was a blast. I also loved Karaoke (sometimes with the Diva, sometimes with another staff member) when it was happening here. We also were present for a round of trivia and planned on doing more. The reality is that you can't do everything you would like to do on a cruise and will exhaust yourself if you try. If we had to miss something, trivia wasn't the worst option because the session we were at was a tiny bit chaotic. Here's the point, as a board game and event venue, the Social Club rocks. As an eatery, it sucks. We are wing connoisseurs. Good wings, such as those served at Razzle Dazzle, are fried hard. These were barely on the right side of done. I didn't try the pretzels, which looked like ball park standard issue, or the milkshakes with alcohol. Based on one item, I don't want to give a negative score but those wings would have been a goose egg.

Our first fancy dinner was Razzle Dazzle:

Aesthetically, this restaurant was interesting. We got a seat by the portico and could see the waves crashing against the side of the ship even though it was dark. The restaurant felt like the red room from Twin Peaks with its white and black zig zags, red and black features, and light bath of red light. I've heard that this was originally Virgin's vegetarian restaurant, and when there was insufficient demand, they expanded the menu to include meat offerings. This is still Virgin's most vegetable-forward menu and its best dishes are largely vegetarian. 

I'll review each item separately at the night restaurants. First, the starters are actually better than the mains. They have a veg and meat option for raw, cured, and crispy. I tried all six.

Avocado Green Goddess Salad - Beautiful presentation, bright flavors, fresh avocado, and that shallot crumble is worth its wait in gems. 10/10

Yellowfin Tuna Tartare - Delicious tuna, acid notes from the onion, herbaceous notes from the pine nuts and basil. 10/10

King Trumpet Carpaccio - Beautiful thin slices, eats very meaty, pickled beech mushrooms create complexity with the earthen taste profile of the trumpets by introducing vinegar, leek provides savory notes and texture. 9/10

Pork Belly - Well cooked, delicious pork belly with salty sweet savory notes. Slaw adds necessary texture. 9/10

Fried Green Tomatoes and Okra - This one was a miss. Overly hard breading that tasted like nothing, chili lime is too muted and not helped by the sauce. Okra is slimy in a way that expands instead of limits its natural sliminess. Tomatoes were brightly sour but ruined by the breading. 2/10

Old Bay Chicken Wings - The decision to fry these hard and use old bay seasoning profile was a stroke of genius. Peppercorn aioli served with it but was not strictly necessary. Single best bite of the meal. 10/10.

Second, the mains were hit or miss but had some clear highs across the smoked, crispy, poached, and braised. I tried six out of eight of them. 

Carrots - Beautiful presentation with the meaty carrots sitting in the fregola. Pitching the sweetness of the roasted carrots against the creaminess of the parmesan and yogurt is genius. Eats a little heavy, but I loved it. 8/10.

Ribeye - Delicious when I ate it rare and shockingly vegetable forward: sweet potatoes, green beans, and crispy tobacco onions. The sweetness of the potatoes and crispy green beans and onions cuts the fattiness of the steak and au jus. Very good bite. Unlike the other offerings, except the ""v"" chicken (which I didn't try, looked too carb heavy/large) this is a big plate - be careful. 10/10

Nashville Hot Cauliflower - Brilliant idea undercut by bad execution. I have a strong spice tolerance. I made it through about four bites of this. The pickles and sauce do not calm the heat down enough for it to be palatable. 1/10.

Blackened Mahi Mahi - Fish was over. Polenta was shaped like a brick and felt like a brick in my stomach. Creamed chard was welcome counterpoint to bland fish, but if there was pepper jelly in this I did not taste it. 3/10.

Braised Leek Malfadine - I don't want to judge this one too harshly because I think my palate was blown out on cream by the time I got to this plate and the two strongest notes here are cream and sour. Also, full disclosure, I was full. A little more hazelnut would help or anything that would provide some balance to that heavy feta would be welcome. 6/10.

Lamb Shank - It's a lamb shank with root vegetables and gravy. Not rocket science, but it wasn't broke and they didn't need to fix it. 10/10.

At some point, I need to get in here that I had a virgin mango margarita with a salt rim and it rocked my socks. Desert was good too, I had both smoky offerings and one baked option. 

Vanilla Bean Creme Brule - The sugar covering did crack, the fruit addition was perfect and the custard itself did indeed have a lovely smoky vanilla taste. 10/10

Dark Smores - Smores Cup in the Galley is a better choice. Ingredients were out of proportion. I would have liked less of the chocolate, more of the toasted merengue, and more of the graham cracker crumble. The chocolate was too rich and I got no mint from it at all. 3/10.

Rum Apple Cake - Delicious, much prettier to look at and defter hand in balancing the sweetness, cinnamon ice cream is delicious and the rum just adds a little bit of bitterness with the sweet. 10/10

I'm trying to keep this more or less sequential. After eating a delicious meal, we went to about 80 percent of the Miss Behave Show (yes, we snuck in late). I don't want to give anything away, but it's basically a game show where the audience is divided into two teams and participates for points that don't really matter. You don't really need to participate if you don't want to. It's a raunchy good time and the hostess has a lot of charisma. 9/10.

Pajama Jam - Seemed like a party. We went over to the area toward the front of the ship and caught about half of it in our pjs. The host of Miss Behave did a great cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" by La Bouche. Definitely a vibe, although we felt like the only sober folks there. 10/10.

Day Two was our sea day. We began it with a little workout which was also kind of a show. V/H/S (Videos/Headbands/Simmons). It was a blast. We wore our head and arm bands and worked out to 80s music. 10/10.

Still wearing our headbands, we went to the impossibly beautiful Wake restaurant for brunch. We were seated near the portico and were able to watch the ocean pass us by as we had a luxurious slow meal. The Apertivo Spritz was a wonderful nonalcoholic choice to accompany the meal as well. 

Starter: 

Razor Clam Chowder - table-side presentation where they pour the cream base of the soup around the freshly fried clams and potatoes. Best chowder I've ever had and I‚Äôve been to Massachusetts. 10/10.

Mains:

Soft Shell Crab Benedict - delicious hollandaise, correctly poached egg, generous portion of soft-shell crab lightly fried, corn cake on the bottom instead of an english muffin. Fantastic. 10/10.

The Wake Benedict - a little dry but the fried pork belly had a good flavor to it. Would have put the Soft-Shell Crab Benedict in the menu as the signature personally. 7/10.

Steak and Eggs - surprise, surprise, the steakhouse has a good steak and eggs. I did mine rare with eggs over easy and had a great time. 10/10.

Dessert:

Crepe Cake - such a brilliant idea for a dessert. Thin layers of crepe between layers of cream stacked high. All of the sweetness from this dessert comes from the strawberry and the candied pistachios (as well as a little texture). 10/10.

After the aforementioned pool time and a little break to reenergize, we went to see Around the World with the Diva. It was a great drag show with the expected costume changes, musical numbers and jokes. Good use of video screens throughout this performance. Cordelia Facade is electric as the Diva. Easy 10/10.

We saw the ship's Variety Show, It's a Ship Show, afterwards. The host was very personable, tying together the various acts with jokes, the dancers added personality to their role as accessory to the host, and the house band was very talented and integral to many of the games which pulled the audience into the act. As someone who has put together shows in the past, I assume that the ""bones"" of the show (host, dancers, and band) are the same on every cruise and they switch out the four variety acts. I don't want to spoil anything, but the four acts on this cruise were very fun and two of them were spellbinding. 10/10. 

We didn't eat at It's A Ship Show because we had heard it isn't very good. As always, I had a wonderful mocktail during the show. I forgot the name and can't find the menu anywhere, sorry. For our second fancy dinner, we went to Extra Virgin:

Starters:

Crispy Artichoke - This one's a little on the tin. It was well cooked and delicious. The caper aioli was a great topper. 8/10.

Smoked Chicken Liver Mousse - I was so scared to try this but I am so glad that I did. It was a smoky umami bomb, and I enjoyed every moment of it. Bread to mousse ratio was a little off. 9/10.

Braised Mini Meatballs - Best of the appetizers by a country mile. The pork and beef mix and sauce were very serviceable but the real key to this dish is the melted smoked mozzarella and crispy pancetta. So good that I almost ordered more knowing that I was eating most of the menu. 10/10. 

Salmon Crudo - New night, new uncooked fish. This was the weakest of the four. The mandarin sauce was a little too sweet and there was nothing else to provide meaningful contrast. Still a beautiful cut of salmon. 7/10.

Fried Calamari - Good breading, good cook on the calamari (somehow not rubbery), and the chili sauce was quite good. It didn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel, but it was good. 9/10.

Mains:

Potato Gnocchi - Delicious creamy sauce, good texture on the gnocchi. My only ding is that if there were hen of the woods mushrooms in this, I didn't find them. 8/10.

Gemelli Al Nero Seafood Pasta - Good texture, pleasant pops of seafood, but I got chicken broth from that sauce more than sea urchin. Pleasant heat. 7/10.

Pappardelle Al Ragu - sweetish Bolognese. Eats well and good cook on the pasta but needs a ""kick"". 7/10.

Braised Pork Cheek - Glad I tried it, but it was uneven. Some parts of the cheek were crispier and delicious while other portions were fatty and frankly hard to swallow. Greens and chantarelles helped. 5/10.

Gorgonzola Crusted New York Steak - Delicious, that sharp gorgonzola cheese was everything. The choice to finely grate the brussels sprouts was genius. Favorite bite of the night. 10/10.

Scarlet Night: After dinner, we were pretty wiped and quite full. However, we took some time to watch the Scarlet Lady proceedings. The first little fifteen-minute show was a mood-setting device and it was eerily sublime to see the ship lit up in red. We saw the giant octopus over the pool and sat in the heat for a few minutes before going in for the night. Virgin knows how to throw a themed party, that's for sure. 

Key West Day: We slept in ahead of our booked wildlife ""Shore Thing"" in Key West. What a beautiful place! We actually went ""up the keys"" and saw various wildlife while our guide told us everything about the history of Key West and the surrounding keys. We saw local floral and fauna, crossed the seven-mile bridge, and visited multiple natural parks. One of the highlights was seeing a miniature key deer (they're the size of dogs fully grown). After the tour, we went to Ernest Hemingway House (again, no spoilers, but playing with several of the dozens of polydactyl cats on the premises was a highlight) and ate a slice of key lime pie (tourist price is 12 American dollars per slice). All in all, we spent about seven hours in Key West. 10/10.

The Wake was our third fancy dinner. My favorite meal of the trip. It had low points, but the highs were truly euphoric. We also got to sit by a portico as the sun set, and it was very romantic. 

Starters:

Wedge Salad - My wife actually had this one but I snagged a piece. Very good if exactly what you would expect based on the description. 8/10. 

Hamachi Crudo - Sweet, salty, and sour. The hamachi was nicely salted (if slightly unevenly) and the pickled rhubarb sauce brought the sweet and sour. Probably my favorite raw fish of the cruse. 9/10. 

Roasted Bone Marrow - Elegantly presented, but the buttered brioche unfortunately overpowers the taste of the bone marrow. It ends up tasting more like butter or olive oil. 2/10. 

Mains:

Shrimp and Grits - I've had good shrimp and grits and this wasn't it. Shrimp were in a tomato sauce, there was a single layer of cheese between the grits and shrimp for some reason although it wasn't advertised on the menu. Grits were dry and tasteless. 1/10.

Salt Baked Dorade - This was the surprise hit of the meal. Our waiter, who also served us for brunch and was a gem, showed us the Dorade in its salt covering before plating it. It was juicy and savory and flaky and perfect, the caper lemon butter sauce added so much flavor to it. My wife, who doesn't usually go for fish prepared like this, loved it. 10/10.

Hangar Steak w/ Bone Marrow Bearnaise, Roasted Mushrooms & Asparagus - Perfectly cooked steak, great seasoning and great flavor. As sides, I got the wild mushrooms cooked in brown butter and asparagus, both of which were great. The bearnaise was delicious, very buttery. 10/10.

Filet Mignon - No words, literal meat candy. 10/10.

Lamb Chops - Wife and I disagreed on this one. She thought that it was under seasoned. I thought it was subtly seasoned, but not under seasoned. I dipped it in the bearnaise and kept it pushing. It might also help that I ordered mine rare (and it came out medium rare) and she ordered hers medium (and it was probably medium-well). 8/10.

Desserts:

Baked Alaska - Beautiful presentation with the torched merengue. The refreshing cold of the pistachio ice cream really seals the deal. 9/10.

Apple Tatin - It gives caramel apple. The cuts make it look like a work of art and it tastes amazing. 9/10. 

Also, if you're here and don't drink liquor, get the Ginger Rogers mocktail. It is a Shirley Temple with ginger beer.

Magnets Reloaded - Awesome acapella show. Talented, funny guys. A few genuine surprises. 10/10.

We Fancy Party - We saw the first few minutes of the We Fancy party. It gave me weird vibes that it was in the Manor and there was a dancing ""in the round"" thing going on when there were a bunch of people sitting around at tables and recording the mainly twenty-somethings dancing in front of the DJ booth. The Virgin cast (Happenings Cast or something like that) did a great job of playing off the theme by lining up and snapping fans (not outlawed on Virgin!) to bring people into the circle and give people a social media moment. Again, Virgin knows how to throw a party, but the leering aspect of it didn't sit right with me and the folks at the tables were like half the people in the Manor. 

BIMINI BABY: This day was such a dream. We booked a spot on the sold-out cultural heritage tour of Bimini. I could go into what that meant and how many ways this tour changed my perception of the island of Bimini, Bahamas writ-large, and the interconnectedness of all things and people, but not everything needs to be catalogued, packaged, and presented for public consumption. Suffice it to say that if you go to Bimini, on Virgin or any other cruise ship or context, go on the cultural heritage tour. 

Afterwards, we went to Virgin's Bimini Beach Club. We didn't leave until we were pulled away. There was a Virgin restaurant there called Beach Eats. We tried some of the food there:

Honey Jerk Chicken - So flavorful and perfect. Good heat and sweet. 10/10

Fried Casava and Mango Sauce - Casava was a little stale and the sauce didn't taste like anything. 5/10.

Tropical Fruit Salad - It's on the tin. Loved the use of starfruit. Everything was perfectly ripe. 10/10.

Rum Cake - Subtly sweet and delicious. 9/10.

Red Snapper with Mango Ceviche - not much of a ""looker"" but this ceviche tasted delicious; salty, sweet and sour with firm toothsome fish. 8/10. 

Corn w/ Toasted Coconut - Meh. 5/10.

We were interrupted by a storm about halfway through the beach day, but it passed within an hour. The waves were pretty choppy, but the water was so beautiful and blue and serene. Yes, I got a virgin coconut and drank it on the beach. One of the staff made a fantastic mocktail for my wife that was very blackberry forward and tasty. The pool party was a blast. Whatever they're paying these entertainment staff, it's not enough. 

I may have got some mild heatstroke from being in the Bimini heat for eight straight hours, so I took a little time to rest before dinner. 

Logistics: This may be a good time in this screed to talk about one negative thing that occurred exactly twice in our voyage. Bad logistics. For Bimini, there really needs to be one person waiting to redirect people to the beach club after the cultural tour. No signs, no clarity. I get that we are all adults, but there was never any explanation of an apparent partnership with Resorts World or that they take people to the beach club or how often they operate. Similarly, we were not directed to any particular place to get to the Shore Thing either.

Similarly, disembarkation was a nightmare. Everybody had the same idea to have a large, leisurely breakfast at the Galley (us included), and it was a long line to exit the ship which was made longer by constant jams caused by no one directing traffic. I love that Virgin encourages a final meal on disembarkation day (rather than throwing out its patrons with both hands), but some people in the hallway would paradoxically help with the people in the hallway situation. Overall, logistics was probably a 6/10 for me because of these two issues.

Our final fancy dinner was spent at Pink Agave. We never made it to Gunbae or Test Kitchen. Maybe on the next one. 

Small Plates:

Guacamole - Perfect guac. Love when it has chunks of pure avocado in it. Chips were good too. 10/10.

Esquites - Excellent street corn. Loved the lime-forwardness of it all. 8/10.

Aguachile - Second favorite raw fish at these dinners. Yet more avocado and bright chunks of tuna. 9/10.

Medium Plates:

Enchilada de Pollo - quite dry. needed more (or any) of the salsa verde. 5/10. 

Papas con Chorizo - I only had a bite of my wife's plate. Spicy, savory chorizo and crispy potatoes. 8/10.

Large Plates:

Pescado - bass was over, but the mole verde brought it back for me. Keep in mind that I had mild sun damage when I ate this meal, so my notes are not going to be as detailed. 7/10. 

Pato - mole adds spice and the smoked yam adds both smokiness and sweetness. Duck was perfectly medium and decadent. It was a little cold, but I spent over two hours on this meal so I believe that is on me. 9/10.

Bistec Marinero en Escabeche - ancho sauce and Oaxaca cheese add robust flavor to a well-made ribeye steak. I ordered mine rare and it was just shy of blue rare. I have heard people say that this is the best steak on the ship. It's good, but that honor goes to the Hanger Steak at the Wake in my humble opinion. Excellent though. 10/10.

Deserts: 

Chocolate Masa - Ugly but delicious. It's not a looker at all but this tastes like delicious cake with a fudgy center and the fruit salsa gives it a chocolate-covered fruit moment. 9/10.

Chocolate Taco - Beautiful but icky. It felt like a bottom shelf item from the sweets bar at the Galley. Overly sweet and better for an Instagram photo than a tasty treat. 1/10. 

I also had two virgin Pineapple Agua Frescas that were absolutely delicious and a very good Americano (to bring me back to life).

Untitled Dance Party - Although I was dead tired and full as a tick, we decided to go to the last show of the night that wasn't the themed party of the night (which we missed). As with all the other shows, I don't want to give it away. There were moments in this show that I really enjoyed and/or moved me to tears. However, it just didn't come together for me. The energy of the artists won me back a bit. 6/10.

Fine Dining Dinner Rankings (composite score plus x factor):

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

1mzf86e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianCoffeeTime/comments/1mzf86e/over_coffee_today_ask_yourself_this_what_does_it/,Over Coffee today: Ask yourself this: What does it really take to be saved? What does God expect from us?,"Simple. Look unto him.

More detailed response? Need a tour around the farm to see it? Well first: You‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking unto‚Äù people to answer that question. So, good luck with that; picking thru all these responses people give you, looking unto people to tell you what it really takes to be saved. So, it‚Äôs already sunk. ""Looking unto"" people. To regard what they say as authority for it, when it's not.  Why?

When, God said about EVERYBODY, to the very ends of the earth, that:¬†*‚ÄúThere is not a just man on earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not‚Äù*¬†\- Bible. (Ecclesiastes 7:20). That, ‚Äú*filthy; done abominable works‚Äù*¬†Psalm 14:1‚Äì3 Like, asking a Pedophile, raped and slaughtered 593 little 4 y/o‚Äôs, ask or look unto him to tell you when the Day Care Center opens. Nobody is going to walk after to go ask someone who did that, anything about their kids. Should be you, too, then: Same with people, when not one of them, including me, can save anybody; all condemned.

Like, asking a Death Row Inmate, imprisoned. Awaiting execution, if they would write you an insurance policy on your house, based solely on them. They: without any money; condemned. Will sit in an electric chair for their crimes. Somehow believe: that, if anything happens: A fire, or flood, this murdering, lying packed to the brim with all sorts of filthy works, can verifiably issue you an insurance policy that will ‚Äúsave‚Äù your house.  Can't.

But there is one amongst all off us, where the whole pile of everybody: Adam onward, where not one person has accomplished or done the Ten Commandments. No, not one. None. That God in the Bible. Daniel 9:24‚Äì27, determined, as God: Alone by himself, that he would do a work with sin. Make himself the payment, where to everybody on earth, he already decreed, and, he‚Äôs God over all of it, decreed: ‚Äúthe soul that sinneth, it shall die‚Äù¬†- God. (Bible. Ezekiel 18:20), where ‚Äúfor all have sinned‚Äù (Romans 3:23), means everybody is condemned to die, like a death row inmate, and not one can escape it. All condemned. That God would do a work with sin, that would:

1. **Finish the transgression**
2. **Make an end of sin**
3. **Make reconciliation for iniquity**
4. **Bring in everlasting righteousness¬†(Daniel 9:24)**  God would do this work with sin himself. He already DID it.

How he determined he would do it, would be in and by Jesus Christ. Daniel 9:25‚Äì27 ‚Äúadds up‚Äù to him. That God was in Jesus Christ. Reconciling the world unto himself. Not imputing our trespasses unto us (2 Corinthians 5:19). God did a work, by HE: Took your sins off you. Laid them on Jesus Christ on the cross. Took mine off me. Laid them on Jesus Christ. Did that for your neighbor, next door. Everybody. In your town had this same work done unto them. Everybody in your State, and Nation. Every Nation with everybody just on this earth, it was done unto all of them, by God himself. That, crucified, on the cross - your sins were purged by and in God himself. Satisfied Ezekiel 18:20, because, God paid it. It was God, in Jesus Christ, DID the Ten Commandments. Since it was God did them, everywhere, where I broke them, he already did the work. Made himself the compensation for it.

In John 3:18, Jesus said this:¬†**‚ÄúHe that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.‚Äù**  John 16:9, Jesus repeats it; that, just not regard God and his work, we sin against him, and, this is the sin now condemns anybody.  Just lowly esteem, or disregard - try to do the work ourselves, say God's work couldn't possibly do it. Not believe him.

Because he made himself the sacrifice for sin, and God raised his word who he made flesh - Jesus Christ - from the dead, where he sits at the right hand of God; because, the work he did is righteous, because, Jesus said, ‚Äú**There is NONE good, but one, that is, God‚Äù** (Matthew 19:17).  So, it's really simply ""who"" to look unto, to answer your question.  He just IS salvation himself.

Asks you to believe on him. AND? This ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù just means, in the dictionary to ‚Äúaccept as true‚Äù what someone says or is, by ‚Äúwho‚Äù they are, you just accept as true what they say, so you naturally just follow it to do, because, if it‚Äôs true, you can follow it, and it, to you, is a profit. And man, is this ever a profit for a guy or a woman slated for the electric chair, where everybody is slated to go there. Not one can escape it. That you just regard his work. Consider the operation of his hand. What works God has done vs. regard your own or other people. What they say or decree.

And again, what you ‚Äúaccept as True‚Äù you will¬†*‚Äúwalk after‚Äù*¬†to¬†*‚Äúwalk in‚Äù*¬†because, you¬†*‚Äúlook unto‚Äù*¬†it is true, is why you believe it. Where as what you ‚Äú*dismiss as inadequate; faulty or unacceptable‚Äù*¬†you do not believe true; it‚Äôs impossible to OBEY it; can‚Äôt. Won‚Äôt. You will ‚Äúrebel‚Äù against it. So, when God says:¬†***‚ÄúLook unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth: For I am God, there is NONE else****‚Äù -*¬†God¬†(Bible. Isaiah 45:22)

Which of these two are you? YOu have to be ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù that is, ‚Äúreasoned together‚Äù with - and the BEST time - is when you just sit there. Over coffee. To consider: YOU- - will either this ""reason together"" will either just be you: alone, with yourself, do it; and I did that for decades. Never looked unto him. Looked unto me and or look unto other people to ‚Äúdo it‚Äù what was ‚Äúgood.‚Äù - That is, I did not see reason together what he says is ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äútrue‚Äù - - or not. Did not regard God or his work. When he tells everybody over the whole earth to ‚Äú*Come now, let us reason together‚Äù*¬†saith the LORD,¬†*‚Äúthough your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Though they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool.‚Äù*¬†\- God. (Bible. Isaiah 1:18).

Now I see it. It‚Äôs so plain and simple. So in my face. Just look unto him. That's what he said to do. There is none else. He already said it. It‚Äôs true. AND he‚Äôs God, and he decrees it, by the word he speaks. Out of his mouth. That he just makes all the earth and heaven align with, when whosoever of anybody just looks unto him, scripture says in 2 Chronicles 16:9 ‚Äú*For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.‚Äù*¬†\- so he LOOKS for it constantly - his eyes go to and fro over the whole earth, to simply himself - show himself strong in behalf of whosoever of everybody over the whole earth, looks unto him - he 1. *sets them apart for future use.* \[that's what ""save"" means\] - so even if it was everybody who did it, he would simply save them. Because he can. He‚Äôs God.

Because, they look unto him. Done. Your tour of the farm is over. This, over coffee.  Did it help?

**What does it really take to be saved? What does God expect from us?**

1mzf85t,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeeshopowners/comments/1mzf85t/purchase_or_lease_espresso_equipment/,Purchase or lease espresso equipment,"Hi there, I am a 8 year coffee shop manager who has recently stepped away from my position while I finish nursing school. I picked up part time work for my friends bakery that currently doesn‚Äôt over any beverages but she‚Äôs interested in partnering with me to offer coffee. 
I‚Äôm passionate about coffee and I have a solid foundation of knowledge surrounding creating quality beverages. 
She had a hot water line installed to function with a commercial brewer that is not currently in use. 
This is a smaller business and I wouldn‚Äôt expect the addition of coffee to add an incredible demand but rather enhance the current business model. 
That being said I am torn on whether I should look into leasing options of super automatic espresso machines that are more hands off (and less revenue being that revenue is shared with leasing company) or investing in a commercial espresso machine and the time/energy to train staff on crafting espresso drinks. 

What would you do? What advice can you offer me? 

My background is in restaurant management and I owned my own business for a short period of time. Coffee is a huge passion of mine and I‚Äôm excited about the possibility of integrating this into an existing business. ",1,1756090286.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

For reference, we have a lakehouse that is $500 a night. Direct waterfront with a beach. It is fully stocked - we use it ourselves and feel we‚Äôve thought of most everything someone would need/want and truly care about the guest experience. (We don‚Äôt leave any personal belongings - it is set up primarily as an Airbnb.) It is professionally cleaned at each turnover. We provide all white sheets, beds made crisp like a hotel, fresh white towels, plenty of facecloths, grey makeup cloths, bath mats, new appliances, a full set of new Paderno pots and pans complete with lids, ninja blender, 4 slice toaster, casserole dishes, dish rack, full can of coffee and tea, all the spices you‚Äôd need, paper towel, all the food wraps, all new furnishings, kids toys in abundance (including a play kitchen set with food, magna tiles, mega blocks, kids games, 15 or so kids books), high chair, board games, 12 beach towels, canoe, kayaks, stand up boards‚Ä¶ I could go on. 

We booked a similar type of place for a week long stay, but near the ocean (2 min walk). It‚Äôs a newer build, spacious with new furnishings. We sleep 7, they sleep 8. 

However, I can‚Äôt help but feel like the hosts have fallen a bit short. It‚Äôs tough because our place costs the same nightly rate, same amount of bedrooms‚Ä¶ (we have one less bathroom, and no laundry) I‚Äôm trying not to compare, but how do you not? 

There are no bath mats. They gave us 7 towels, 2 hand towels and 3 face cloths, for a week long stay for 4 people and I have to use the towels as bath mats and wash towels every day. The towels are old, dark grey with bleach spots. We got exactly 4 beach towels. The sheets are mixed and matched, one dark blue bottom sheet, one white top sheet. One of the beds has a duvet, the other just has a thin blanket. The sheets look clean, the beds were made, but not with great care. Half of the pillows are old/flat. 2/3 bedrooms have black out roller shades but the primary bedroom does not, only sheer curtains (lacks the feeling of privacy/no sleeping in past dawn, I had to order black out travel suction blinds, arriving from Amazon on Tuesday.) 

The listing says ‚Äòkids toys and books‚Äô. There are two buckets and two shovels for the beach, one toy in the living room and no books. We didn‚Äôt bring much bc we travelled across the country and the listing said there would be some. We‚Äôre here for a week, it‚Äôs calling for a few rainy days, those toys and books would have come in handy - should I suck it up and go buy some to keep my kids entertained?

The listing said coffee was included. There are 2 random nespresso coffee pods and two half used small jars of flavoured instant coffees and the closest grocery store you could get a box of pods is 30 min away. The listing shows an espresso combo drip machine, with canisters next to it, but there is only a nespresso machine. There are two flavours of tea that look like they came from an old Christmas gift basket. 

We‚Äôre using barely sharp Ikea knives, mismatched old cookware, no lids, a random assortment of cooking utensils that looks like they were thrown in the drawer of a dorm room. The toaster is a $10 unit that barely fits a slice of bread. There is no dish rack for handwashing things. 

Things are decently clean. I‚Äôd give it a 8/10 - dirty light switches, smudgy shower glass, greasy hood fan, just some things that were overlooked. They definitely clean it themselves. Still decent though. 

The listing has 5 stars, with great written reviews. I know how valuable ratings are to business, so I don‚Äôt want to leave a bad review or be ‚Äòthat person‚Äô who nit picks. I plan to ask the host for coffee, bath mats and facecloths, and maybe clarification on where the kids toys/books would be (although we have looked everywhere). 

It seems like an over promise, under deliver situation. Is this just because I am a host? What is normal? Am I being unreasonable? Should I have clarified everything before we got here? (What kind of kids toys and books do you provide? Do you provide paper towel? What kind/how much coffee do you provide? How many towels will we have?) 

How do I manage this? Now that I‚Äôm writing this it‚Äôs solid 4 star, but is that only bc I‚Äôm comparing quality and value?

1mzf6xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1mzf6xc/trip_report_august_2025/,Trip Report August 2025,"Just wanted to post back with a thank you for all of the good advice received here! We just returned from a week in Dublin, Adare, and Galway. Great trip!

I was traveling with my 20 year old daughter. I was initially unwilling to drive, but I did and it was fine. More on driving below.

We arrived in Dublin at 10am. We stayed at the Maldron Kevin Street and I paid 50 euros to check in early. The hotel was fine, centrally located. It was nothing special but Oasis was playing in Dublin and I felt lucky to have gotten a hotel at all! But it was clean, had good coffee in the AM, and was in walking distance to everything.

We did the Book of Kells exhibit, walked around Grafton Street and shopped - lovely! Had lunch in that area and then went back for a rest and to freshen up before dinner. We walked around the Temple Bar area and people watched & took pictures. We had great wood fired sourdough pizza & cocktails at Fade St Social. 

The next morning we took the bus to Limerick. I didn‚Äôt want to drive in Dublin/have to deal with picking up at the airport, parking in the city, etc. so off to Limerick on the bus which was comfy and easy. Picking up the car there was easy and it was basically two quick turns out of the city and we were on the highway on the way to Adare.

Adare is only 15 minutes outside of Limerick and it‚Äôs a charming village. We stayed at the Dunraven Arms Hotel which was wonderful. We had a big room with a couch and a comfy 4 poster bed and a beautiful bathroom. Very sweet hotel with a pretty garden, restaurant, bar, spa. We were there two nights and I loved it.

We had booked tea at the Adare Manor, which is a beautiful, grand old place. Tea was wonderful. It was a treat to be inside the manor and the beautiful Tudor style long hall where they serve tea. We took a bunch of pictures afterwards in the formal garden.

We had a little snack in the hotel bar and some drinks around 8 because we were basically still full from tea. 

The next day I drove to Killarney and we walked the Gap of Dunloe and back to our car for about 2 hours. We had hoped to hike to Lord Brandon‚Äôs but a storm was forecasted and the turned dark and we turned around and it thundered the whole way back, but didn‚Äôt rain until right when we reached the car. I‚Äôm not sure if we made it to the actual gap, but the spot where we turned was a gorgeous viewpoint on the water - the whole walk was beautiful and the vibe with the other walkers and the haunting carts was really nice and fun. Highly recommend walking or the pony carts - don‚Äôt drive it, especially after 10am.

Had a nice lunch and drove back to Adare. I was doing ok with the driving! Adare to Killarney was an easy drive on a wide highway. The drive up to the Gap was similar to driving up to a ski area. But then on the way home there was a crazy detour right outside of Adare on a tight little rural road and that was nuts. Lots of turns, lots of construction trucks. But we made it back without incident. 

Driving in general was not great, but I did it and I didn‚Äôt have any accidents. It was stressful and between concentrating on the road, the sheep, the oncoming traffic, the GPS, the speedometer - it was tough to take on any side views. A big thank you to the person who posted that there are dashcam videos on YouTube - I watched a bunch to see what I was getting into with each big drive. Driving on the left was very easy to get used to and the roundabouts were not hard, especially with GPS. The speed is in kilometers so 120km  is 75 mph. 100 is about 55. Driving through villages with cars parked every which was was the hardest thing for me. I didn‚Äôt love driving but I don‚Äôt think bus tours would have worked for us.

Had a sweet dinner in Adare at a place called Auntie Lena‚Äôs.

The next morning we drove to Galway. Limerick/Adare to Galway is an easy highway drive. I don‚Äôt mind city driving and found Galway very easy to drive around. We loved Galway and were there for three nights. I was a little worried that Galway would be like staying in a pub. I‚Äôm not a big drinker anymore. But there is a lot to see and do there and it had such a warm, welcoming feeling. I loved Charlie Byrne‚Äôs Bookstore - I work with books and this must be one of the best bookstores in the world, as far as selection. We walked all over and took a million photos. Had a lovely dinner at Ard Bia, which is a farm to table place, beautiful food.

I didn‚Äôt think the weather was hot at all, but the restaurant was quite hot and stuffy.

We walked around the Latin Quarter after dinner and it was a bit quiet, maybe because it was only Tuesday night. I had an Irish coffee at Garavan‚Äôs and we called it a night.

We stayed at The Victoria, which was almost on Eyre Square. Very similar to the Maldron - small clean room, comfortable enough. There was construction happening outside our window but it wasn‚Äôt all that loud, and they worked from 8:30-5:30 when we were mostly out anyway. A nice bar in the hotel. I appreciated that they let me bring coffee back up to my room because I was up before 7 and my daughter slept later.

The next day we drove to the Cliff of Moher. We made a stop at Dunguaire Castle. Kept going. This was a 
strenuous drive. I did not enjoy it. 
I would rate the drive U for unpleasant! To be honest, the whole day was unpleasant - every vacation has one day where things just don‚Äôt work out and moods are low.

We were lucky that the weather was clear and we could see the cliffs. So that was good! But the whole scene was just awful to me. 5000 cars trying to cram into the car park. Tons of buses. I knew they had fenced the cliffs but they are actually very large concrete barriers. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and the wall, in some of my pictures, came almost to my shoulders. I had to hold my phone over my head to get pix of the whole cliffs. Gnats attacked us, lol. That said, my pictures are pretty nice but we agreed on the way home that we felt guilty about being there - that tourism has kind of ruined what used to be a very special, wild place. We had some beef stew in the cafeteria. And then I drive us home without incident. We had Thai food at a restaurant in Galway right by the Spanish Arch and then we both felt queasy afterward and went back to the hotel to sleep!!

The next day we drove to Connemara Park and hiked the lower Diamond trail. And we had a phenomenal day. This was absolutely wonderful! The sun came out! The roads were spacious! There were sheep walking around the road but that was fine. Incredible views through the Maam Valley to Letterfrack. Then Connemara Park was so beautiful, the lower trail is about 90 minutes round trip and it gave us gorgeous views. Highly recommend! We had a nice little lunch at their visitors center courtyard, abd then I drove us back to Galway without incident!

We realized that we were always starving around 4 and not hungry at all come dinner time. So we stopped in at The Skeff on Eyre Square and this was absolutely wonderful. We had fish and chips and had a drink. Then we split up and I walked down to Galway Cathedral which was absolutely stunning. Then we went out later to Sophie‚Äôs Rooftop at the Dean hotel and shared some apps and had cocktails. Then we found some wonderful music at The Quays pub and had the fun Galway music experience we had hoped for. Very special!

The next day we drove to Dublin Airport, dropped off the rental car, checked into the Maldron Airport which was a tiny room but nice enough. We took a cab into the city and did the Guinness tour, had a little dinner, and then flew home. 

It was a good tight trip! I‚Äôd love to have spent more time in Connemara, but I think Galway was a good choice for this trip together. We barely scratched the surface of a very beautiful country but I‚Äôm glad we visited and we made some wonderful memories!

When it comes to ear mite treatment for cats, understanding the signs and symptoms is crucial for timely intervention. Ear mites, particularly Otodectes cynotis, are microscopic parasites that thrive in a cat's ear canal, leading to discomfort and potential infections. Common symptoms include excessive ear scratching, shaking of the head, and dark, coffee-ground-like debris in the ears.

To effectively treat ear mites, a combination of veterinary-approved medications and home care is essential. The first step in ear mite treatment for cats is a vet consultation. Your veterinarian can confirm the presence of mites and recommend an appropriate treatment plan, which may include:


Prescription Ear Drops: Commonly used medications such as selamectin or ivermectin are prescribed to eliminate ear mites.
Ear Cleaning Solutions: Regular cleaning with vet-recommended solutions can help remove debris and prevent further infestations.
Topical Treatments: Over-the-counter treatments may also be effective but should only be used after consulting with a veterinarian.


In addition to medications, maintaining a clean environment is critical in preventing reinfestation. Regularly wash your cat's bedding and vacuum areas where your cat frequents. Moreover, it's vital to treat all pets in the household simultaneously, as ear mites can easily spread from one animal to another.

Monitoring your cat's recovery is also important. If symptoms persist after treatment, follow up with your veterinarian to explore further options or address any underlying issues. With the right ear mite treatment for cats, you can help your furry friend find relief and restore their ear health.

If you‚Äôre spending time in Abbotsford (aka ‚ÄúAbby‚Äù), here are some great spots locals actually recommend ‚Äî from food to nature to nightlife:

# üåø Outdoors & Activities

* **Mill Lake Park** ‚Äì A beautiful lake right in the middle of the city. Perfect for walking the loop, having a picnic, or just chilling by the water.
* **Willband Creek Park** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre into birdwatching or quiet trails, this one‚Äôs underrated. Great for an afternoon stroll.
* **Clayburn Village** ‚Äì A restored brick village with a historic vibe. Check out the general store for homemade sweets and baked goods.
* **Castle Fun Park** ‚Äì Not just for kids ‚Äî mini golf, batting cages, and a retro arcade make it a fun stop for a group night out.

# üç¥ Restaurants You Should Try

* **Bow & Stern** ‚Äì Known for amazing seafood and cocktails. Their fish tacos and oysters are always a hit.
* **Greek Islands** ‚Äì A local favorite for generous portions and warm vibes. Great for family dinners.
* **Vi-La Palace** ‚Äì Fantastic Vietnamese food (pho, vermicelli bowls, spring rolls). Affordable and filling.
* **Rendezvous Restaurant** ‚Äì Classic comfort food and breakfast spot with a real community feel.
* **House of James Caf√©** ‚Äì A cozy place inside a bookstore, great for coffee and baked goods if you want something quiet.

# üçª Breweries, Bars & Nightlife

* **Field House Brewing** ‚Äì Probably Abbotsford‚Äôs most popular brewery. Chill vibe, rotating craft beers, and a great patio in summer.
* **Old Yale Brewing Outpost** ‚Äì Another solid craft beer spot if you‚Äôre into IPAs and stouts.
* **Ravens Brewing** ‚Äì Award-winning and often underrated. Small taproom but excellent beers.
* **The Canadian Brewhouse** ‚Äì Sports bar atmosphere with lots of TVs and a lively crowd on game nights.
* **Phoenix Lounge** ‚Äì Casual bar/restaurant with live music and events.

# üçì Seasonal & Local Flavor

* **Berry Picking** ‚Äì Abbotsford is *the berry capital*. In summer, hit up U-Pick farms for blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.
* **Abbotsford Farm & Country Market** (Saturdays) ‚Äì Local produce, artisan foods, and crafts. Great way to sample Fraser Valley flavor.

**TL;DR**: For food ‚Äî Bow & Stern, Greek Islands, Vi-La Palace. For drinks ‚Äî Field House Brewing. For outdoors ‚Äî Mill Lake Park. And if you‚Äôre around in summer, don‚Äôt skip berry picking!

1mzewwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mzewwz/right_person_wrong_time_not_a_full_breakup_but/,"Right person, wrong time: not a full break-up, but had to say goodbye to someone I thought could've been my soulmate (separated by distance and life commitments)","I (21F) started talking to a guy (26M) about a month ago. We're both in the same year in college, and he was visiting my college through a summer program, and we ended up working in the same department.

Although we were both working for the majority of the summer, we didn't really talk much until the week he was supposed to leave (I live in the states, he doesn't). Up to that point, I only had very brief, work-related conversations with him.

Then a week before he was supposed to leave, we were messaging each other about work stuff. I made a joke, and that turned into a short banter between us. After that he asked me to dinner for the next evening, saying that he wanted to know more about what exactly I do at work since we were working on different projects.

I agreed, and although there were no clear indications that he asked with the intention of it being a date, it felt like one, and I was pretty excited. I thought he was attractive, and I had been wanting to get to know him better but had never initiated anything because I'm shy and afraid of rejection.

I didn't go into the dinner with any high expectations. I thought this could just be a fun summer fling at best since I knew he would be leaving in a week, and I had no intentions of starting a long distance relationship with someone I barely knew. But long story short, dinner was amazing, and we talked for so long that the restaurant staff had to kick us out because we were there until closing. I learned that we were very similar in a lot of ways, and we also have the same career plans for post-graduation.

I don't think either of us wanted the night to end, but it was pretty late and there weren't that many places that were open, so I ended up just driving us around town for two hours. I showed him random spots, and we talked the entire time about everything, like our family, school, career goals, etc. The conversation felt so easy between us, and I was so surprised at how comfortable I felt with him. It felt like maybe we had known each other in a different life. There was an effortless back-and-forth between us, and I was smiling and laughing so much.

Several times, I asked if I should drop him back off at his place since it was getting late and we both had to go to work the next day. I didn't want him to go, but I asked to be polite. He jokingly said, ""No, don't take me back ever,"" saying that I was the only person he had really talked to this summer and that he bad been lonely. We made plans to go out again, and he joked that we could hang out every day before he left. Making plans again had also been partly justified by the fact that he had paid for dinner (~$85), and I had told him that I owed him. Anyways, we ended up spending 5 hours together that night.

I just realized how long this story is getting, so thank you if you're still reading. I'll try to summarize the next parts as much as possible.

Over the next week, we hung out 4 more times, and of course we still saw each other at work. We got coffee together the second day, went to dinner and saw a movie and talked in my car for two hours the third day, went to dinner and an ice cream place and his apartment the fourth day, and then went to dinner and his place again the fifth day. Besides the time we got coffee, every other date ended up being 8-12 hours long. He was very much a gentleman, and every time he insisted on paying, even for the second dinner that I said I would pay for because I owed him for the first one. In the end, I was able to pay about half for everything because I refused to let him be the only person spending money. But it felt nice because each time he would say something like ""I'll get this one, so you can pay the next time,"" and it felt like he wanted there to be a next time.

We opened up about a lot of personal stuff, and after the day we saw the movie, I decided to be a bit more brave since I figured I had nothing to lose with only three days left. I asked him if he wanted to hang out again soon, and he said, ""if I had a car, I would've already picked you up.""

The third day, when we went to his apartment, we ended up confirming that this wasn't platonic and that it was romantic. However, we both said that we weren't looking for a relationship, and we both understood the impossibility of the situation. We cuddled for a long time, and things eventually went a little physical, and the next night we ended up back at his place again. Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, we started talking about him leaving, and I asked if he ever imagined us being together. He said no and essentially that I didn't matter to him, that he wouldn't miss me and that he would be fine without me. I asked, ""so my heart is the only one that's breaking, yours is completely fine?"" He responded, ""I think ours are breaking for different reasons. Mine is breaking because I know I'm breaking yours.""

I didn't understand why he was saying all these things, after we had cuddled for so long and he had given me unmistakable signals before. He had even said at one point that he thought it would take longer for him to forget about me than it would for me to forget about him. But now he was saying the opposite of everything before, and I was starting to question if I had made everything up in my head. When I told him I was confused about what had been real and what hadn't been, he said he wasn't available and reminded me that he had a lot on his plate (he has heavy family responsibilities back home). He said it wasn't personal but that he wasn't sure he would ever be in a relationship or ever get married because of those responsibilities. I asked if he even hopes for the future, and he said no.

I cried a little bit, and he brushed away my tears. He said he was disappointed in himself for letting us get carried away, and he looked so guilty and awful.

In the end, I didn't get mad at him. I thought maybe he really didn't care about me, or that he had never felt as much for me as I had for him, and there was nothing I could do about it. I let him go, and I told him not to worry about me because eventually I would move on and that time heals all wounds. We hugged one last time, and he hugged me so tightly that I could barely breathe.

It was only a week, and it's been almost a month since he left, but I think about him and miss him every day. I feel like I lost someone who understood me fully, who saw my soul and liked it for what it was. I never had to pretend to be someone else around him or search for words to fill the silences. I don't know if I've ever met someone that I had such a deep connection to.

With the profession we're both trying to enter, it wouldn't be impossible for us to meet again, maybe at a conference, but it's not exactly likely either. But in my heart, I really hope that the universe finds a way to bring us back together.",1,1756089354.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

""Is that understood?""

The Dean was lecturing me, and I stared down at my lap, trying to fathom how I had gotten myself into this situation.

Guards stood behind me, as if I were some escaped psychopath.

Every time I shifted, I noticed them snap to attention out of the corner of my eye.

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself.

What I had found was a student body deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, where the school's least favorite sign had been scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer‚Äôs dream. The Dean herself was my mother‚Äôs age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person. 

A projector illuminated constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. 

I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded, my cheeks burning. 

Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star looked.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. Books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs sat half-forgotten, and star maps were spread across her laptop, their corners stained with coffee.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn‚Äôt a mistake.

But it‚Äôs not like I could admit that.

For some reason, along with this college‚Äôs draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one sign in particular that had been outcast.

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

Subtle.

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac sign people disliked, it wasn‚Äôt Gemini.

I grew up with classmates hating Pisces because no one wanted to be a fish, or Cancer because of the crab. But Gemini?

Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to notice how badly Gemini students were treated, especially the guys.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who, at first, seemed like the class clown. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker, or what I thought was an icebreaker, and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I‚Äôm a Gemini?"" he said, sounding unsure, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I‚Äôm a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but instead I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like he had just confessed to murdering his whole family.

The girl next to him inched away, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting toward the back of the room.

It was almost robotic, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. 

I hadn‚Äôt even noticed the four students in the shadows, hunched over their MacBooks. 

The professor‚Äôs expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think‚Ä¶"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself. ""You should go join your friends at the back.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt.

The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is‚Ä¶ is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn‚Äôt even looking at him.

""But‚Ä¶"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. 

He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. 

I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. 

I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. 

A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust. Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. 

It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. 

According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn‚Äôt look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. 

They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. 

I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. 

It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius."" She curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign."" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flicked to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding."" I scoffed. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

The Dean couldn‚Äôt justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn‚Äôt surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

The words suffocated my mouth, eager to spill out.

After weeks of feeling like I was back in sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good.

""Because that is all it is, what you're all unhealthily obsessed with."" I spoke through my teeth now, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars. They don't mean anything to anyone, except children.""

""Miss Oliver‚Äî""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic.

I stabbed at the twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me.

She leaned back like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, keeping that professional, if slightly strained, smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean said sharply, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat.

""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms.""

The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, rising to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office.

The Dean's words didn‚Äôt leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath and regretting every word I'd spat.

She‚Äôd sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large, crumbling structure that used to be the student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Couch-crashing in a friend's dorm seemed a lot better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn‚Äôt care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the full Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played over the intercom.

""Starting from 8pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. I thought she was just tired from classes.

She didn‚Äôt react at first. She sent me a sleepy smile, then said she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn‚Äôt expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom‚Äôs butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me. Her whole body trembled, fingers tightening around the handle.

Her expression twisted with a feral fear I couldn‚Äôt understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out."" She sobbed through the words. Her ponytail swung as she twisted toward the door. ""Please. I don‚Äôt want to hurt you."" She waved the knife wildly, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. 

""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend‚Äôs hand. 

They were fucking serious about this.

The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle‚Äôs frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn‚Äôt resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn‚Äôt care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" 

Another step, and she squeaked. 

""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo‚Äôs making you do this?‚Äù 

She didn‚Äôt respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn‚Äôt know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" 

I didn‚Äôt expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. 

""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. 

""I‚Äôm sorry, Smith. I‚Äôll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.‚Äù

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don‚Äôt hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don‚Äôt look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. 

I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. 

The dorm looked more like a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half-moon poking through the clouds.

There was something glued to the front door, a simple white sheet of paper.

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: ""NO."" in bold letters.

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar.

""Five minutes,"" the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times.

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?""

I swallowed hard. ""I'm a...""

My star sign tangled in my throat when a crash sounded behind me. I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk.

My stomach lurched into my throat. I turned back to knock again, only for my fists to meet something warm. 

A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. 

I could barely make out his face, just a mop of reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy sputtered but didn‚Äôt try again. I made sure not to let my guard down.

‚ÄúYou told the Dean about me?‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?‚Äù

He snorted. ‚ÄúYou can talk.‚Äù

More screams rang out behind us. I couldn‚Äôt resist trying to slip through the gap in the door, but he shoved me back, quick as a whip.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

The shadow paused, then stepped into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to push past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way.

His eyes were hidden by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. ‚ÄúAh, yes, the traitor!‚Äù he said, like he‚Äôd been waiting for this exact moment. ‚ÄúHiding in Sagittarius, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt notice.‚Äù He cocked his head. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that working out for ya?‚Äù

I heard laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal clamped around his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

‚ÄúTraitor?‚Äù I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he‚Äôd stood in front of a mirror rehearsing these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

‚ÄúThe secret Gemini,‚Äù he said, making a huge show of blocking my way. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so unfortunately...‚Äù 

He dragged out the ‚Äúey‚Äù sound like he was auditioning for The Joker. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no room at the inn, dude.‚Äù

His lips curled into a spiteful smile. Behind me, another crash echoed.

Ice shot down my spine. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy stiffened, but if he was scared, he didn‚Äôt show it.

He had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. 

For a moment, I thought I saw hurt crumple his expression, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, replaced with a surprisingly convincing fa√ßade.

His gaze followed mine.

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot.

When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened.

He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. 

I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

‚ÄúHave fun locking yourself up,‚Äù he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. 

This time, I saw it clearly, a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. 

He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

‚ÄúThis is your two-minute warning,‚Äù the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

‚ÄúIt wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúThe rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's a *star sign*!‚Äù I gritted out. ‚ÄúWhy are you going along with this?‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúYou should go,‚Äù he hesitated. ‚ÄúThe top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're fucking insane!‚Äù

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. 

But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù He shot me a grin. ‚ÄúByeeeeee!‚Äù he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

‚ÄúAsshole!‚Äù I yelled, kicking the door. 

*‚ÄúYou shouldn't have sided with the Leo‚Äôs!‚Äù* He rebuttaled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*‚ÄúWhy did you do that?‚Äù*

Another guy‚Äôs voice hissed from behind the door.

*‚ÄúBecause she‚Äôs a traitor.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYeah, but she‚Äôs stuck out there,‚Äù a girl joined in. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you being a little too harsh?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNope. She can sit out there and rot.‚Äù*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn‚Äôt expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. 

Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me. She strayed back, before stumbling over, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

‚ÄúTell me your name,‚Äù she said in a squeak. ‚ÄúI need to know it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm‚Ä¶ I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. 

I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. 

This was my new normal.

""You‚Ä¶ you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn‚Äôt respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to the bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you‚Äì""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something‚Ä¶ light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn‚Äôt realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn‚Äôt hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision.

I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. 

When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him, the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that‚Ä¶ that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he‚Ä¶ pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing five single words. 

**Do not fucking look up.**

But I couldn't *not* look. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

It wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Something was holding onto me, winding its way into my brain. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see‚Ä¶ clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look‚Äì**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to‚Ä¶ touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then‚Ä¶ cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat.

I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. 

There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn‚Äôt look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

‚ÄúComing in?‚Äù

The voice startled me. 

I twisted around, and there he was, the asshole Gemini. 

I took pleasure in walking away, dumping both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all.

S√£o 3 da manh√£, ainda estou deslumbrado com a nossa exibi√ß√£o no jogo de hoje. Estou apaixonado pelo Farioli. O homem merece um c√¢ntico. Vou deixar-vos aqui uma proposta minha. Tenho no√ß√£o que com esta publica√ß√£o poderei ser alvo de meme aqui no sub, mas tamb√©m pode ser uma ideia muito boa. S√£o 3 da manh√£ e j√° tenho algum sono, por isso n√£o sei qual a mais prov√°vel.

Mas aqui vai a minha ideia: uma m√∫sica, cantada em italiano, uma vez que era importante que ele entendesse a letra, e tamb√©m que o fiz√©ssemos sentir em casa. Pensei numa letra que tivesse correspond√™ncia com o instrumental da m√∫sica ""Expresso Macchiato"" do Tommy Cash, a m√∫sica da Eurovis√£o deste ano que mais explodiu nas plataformas.

1mzeto8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mzeto8/question_for_men_i_accidentally_rejected_a_guy_i/,"Question for men: I accidentally rejected a guy I like, what should I do now?","So I recently left my old job for a new opportunity, and one of my coworkers from my previous job asked if we could exchange numbers to stay in touch. We didn‚Äôt interact much outside of work, so I never thought much of it and didn‚Äôt expect him to be interested in me.

He started texting me here and there, asking about my new job and just sending random messages. I thought it was just a friendly way to keep in touch. One time, he asked if I wanted to meet for coffee, and I agreed. During the conversation, we talked about food, and he mentioned that he likes to date girls from my ethnic background. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it - I just laughed and didn‚Äôt respond.

A few days later, I reached out and told him I was going to try the restaurant he recommended (we haven't met for coffee yet). He responded with more food talk, then said he knows another great place and would love to take me there. I agreed, thinking he was just offering like how other colleagues sometimes ask to meet for lunch to catch up. I didn‚Äôt think he was asking me out.

Then, right after I agreed, he asked if I was in a relationship, saying he wanted to make sure he wasn‚Äôt overstepping. For some reason, that made me nervous! I flustered and, without thinking, replied, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not seeing anyone, and I don‚Äôt mind meeting up for food sometime, but this is just a regular hangout, right?‚Äù He said yes, just wanted to check, and then the conversation ended.

It didn‚Äôt hit me until later that he was actually asking me out! I got nervous because I didn‚Äôt realize he was interested in me, and I‚Äôm just not good at talking to guys - I‚Äôm super introverted. After thinking it over, I realized he seems like a decent guy, and I probably came off as not interested.

It‚Äôs been three weeks now, and this has been on my mind. From a guy‚Äôs perspective, would it be a good idea for me to text him and apologize for how I answered and explain that I flustered because I was surprised? Or is it better to just leave it and move on? I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable.

TL;DR:
I accidentally rejected a guy I like. He asked me out, but I didn‚Äôt realize he was interested and got nervous when he asked if I was in a relationship. I flustered and responded in a way that might‚Äôve made him think I wasn‚Äôt interested. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks, and I‚Äôm wondering if I should apologize and explain I was surprised, or just leave it alone.",1,1756089081.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1mzesoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1mzesoh/state_of_the_sub_8242025/,State of the Sub 8/24/2025,"General Knoxx here, coming to tell you what is going down in the ~~god forsaken~~ exciting place!



Welcome to r/Borderlands4! Feel free to ask questions, make posts, and just hang out. We want to be welcoming to newcomers, and vault hunters who have been off exploring other lands while we faithful have been anxiously waiting.

We are less that 20 days away from release! [Thanks for the count down](https://www.reddit.com/user/UpwardSpiral00/), u/UpwardSpiral00! They have done a great job keeping the community updated and their posts have become my favorite part of my morning coffee routine. The character trailers have also been an absolute joy to watch, and the excitement is starting to feel real! And to answer the burning question: I will play as all 4 (6?) vault hunters, but I will start with a gun based Rafa build.

**Topics -** ***in this essay I will discuss...***

For the fun part first! We have been talking as a mod team about what we want the direction of the subreddit, and would love some feedback. Since the Gearbox forums have met the [happy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/w3q1za/gearbox_forums_are_shutting_down/) [dagger](https://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/o-happy-dagger), and so we have decided that we will try to step in. As some of you may remember from Ye Ole Borderlands 3 release days, we will try to sticky hot fixes, patches and Big Discussion Topic posts. For the more controversial ones, one of the mods will use their account. This is for really two reasons a) easier to edit the post discussion box, and b) we get a wee notification on all the comments, and we can remove anything that breaks the side bar. Please do not get upset if we remove your post. It is to keep the subreddit from being 15 individual posts of ""why does x suck/is awesome/whatever"". If you made an excellent post, it will either get linked in a pinned comment, or added in the body of the discussion.

First idea, is a weekly sticky post for LFG that goes live from Thursday until Sunday. While the [Borderlands Discord](https://discord.gg/borderlands) offers this service, we would also like to offer this here too. This will be set up via an automated account. Much like the ratings on the back of your video games state, we will not be responsible for interactions with other people. Please do not tell us that x user was mean, it isn't that we don't care, but it is that we cannot verify this. Also, this could be the place that allows you to skirt a certain rule...the one after 2, and before 4 maybe??

The second is to take a bit more of a positive relationship with creators. We are still not going to allow the posts spamming of ""follow me on Twitch, I am xXborderlandsman69Xx"". But we think that we might try out a Monday only (ends at 11:59 pm eastern) place for creators to post their streams, or videos. There are a lot of fun borderlands creators out there, and this could be a fun way to find some new ones. This will also keep random people from posting ""I am live on twitch"" on here.

We will probably do a questions thread now that we can have up to 6 different posts stickied!!  Details to follow on the first thread.  Eventually.

**Onto the Not So Fun Stuff- Rules and reminders.**

SPOILERS- *As seen in Fast and the Furious, Nekrotafeyo Drift*

We will have a story discussion thread.  We will have a spoilers discussion thread.  Please do not post spoilers.  Use the spoiler tag.  If you do not know how to do it, please look [here](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=how+to+post+spoilers+on+reddit+youtube+video+2025&mid=2C1074FD8FA7144C51812C1074FD8FA7144C5181&FORM=VIRE).  Thanks!  This will be met with bans! until one month after release.  We will have a reminder set.

*Rules- not meant to be broken*

Please take a gander at the side bar. Please be civil. This is the number one rule that is broken. If you wouldn't say it in front of your mother, don't say it here. If someone calls you a name, report it and move on and DO NOT ENGAGE. You will not win an argument with a troll.  Also, arguments that are bunch of comments long just get deleted.  (Thats a lot of words, I ain't readin that)

Under this rule of being civil, please be nice to new people asking ""dumb"" questions in a post.  Being nice to those people help grow the community. (literally got started in the community a billion years asking for help with my over leveled UVHM Axton.)

Please note that any hate speech will NOT be tolerated.  This is against any creed, race, sexual orientation, etc.  This will be an instant ban.  I think this is self-explanatory.  This includes each other, CHARACTERS and people in the community.  Please note that threats of violence are included in this.

Please do not spam.  Making new accounts to get around these rules is against reddit wide rules. Reddit will IP ban you. If you see a sticky thread related to the post you had, please click on that and post there.  If there seem to be lot of posts about a topic, shoot us a modmail, and we will assess.

Meme rule- please use official Borderlands 4 assets to make a meme.

Piracy- this is against the rules of this subreddit to discuss, talk about, or even state that you are going to ""wait to pirate"".  This is out of respect to the developers who sometimes drop into threads.  This isn't really up for debate, and has been a rule in the various Borderlands subreddits going back a decade.

**In Conclusion!** (much like Stephen King, I cannot write these)

We on the Mod Team are just fans of the game who wanted to engage with the community in a different way. We aren't getting paid by Gearbox.

We do want the subreddit to be a fun place to be on release.  We are excited to see the memes, the builds, and watch the community grow into a fun place.

Thanks!

Like... hold up. Is this legit? Or is it just another internet rabbit hole that's too bizarre to *not* check out? 

I went DEEP because, come on, everyone wants some easy side income, right? And here's what I found; buckle up, fam!

- **They claim you can get rich by doing ""App Testing Gateways.""**
- All you need to do is solve Captchas at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and voila! Instant money, supposedly.
- But is this actually a real side hustle... or some wild tech trap?

Here‚Äôs where it gets WEIRD:

- Most sites don‚Äôt EVEN PAY CASH‚Äîthey offer ‚Äúpoints.‚Äù Points?? What am I supposed to do with points? Trade them in at the Internet Arcade??
- Sometimes, these ‚Äúgateways‚Äù demand you sign up for questionable subscriptions. üôÑ
- At **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, they say APP TESTING lets you earn by simply clicking for a few minutes a day.

But‚Äîand I still can‚Äôt BELIEVE THIS‚Äîno one ever says how MUCH $$ you *really* take home.

Is this too good to be true? Or‚Ä¶ are we just cynics and missing out on this untapped goldmine? üò≥

Ready for the punchline? Some horror stories:
- Time wasted‚ÄîHOURS of clicking Captchas, and nada in your PayPal.
- Hidden fees pop up the minute you try to cash out.
- Some apps want access to wayyyy too much of your personal info. Sketchy vibes, tbh.  
- A handful of users said they actually DID earn small change at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, but not enough to even buy a latte.

So here‚Äôs what blows my mind‚Äîthe ecosystem behind ‚Äúcaptcha jobs‚Äù is MASSIVE.
People everywhere are looking for micro-tasks that claim to pay (even pennies) for their attention. Most funnels and ‚Äúgateways‚Äù are really just a lead-in to get your clicks or data.

Let‚Äôs settle this! Have YOU actually made money with Captcha Apps? Whether you went all-in at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, or tried another gateway, spill the tea! 

Here‚Äôs what I want to know: 
- Have you ever gotten a payout?
- Was it worth your time?
- Or did you just end up angrily clicking X and promising never again?

Leave your hot takes and suss stories below‚Äîseriously, the internet NEEDS to know if **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is a badge of scammy nonsense... or real passive income.

READY, SET, DEBUNK! üî•

And yeah, I think I‚Äôll be reading Captchas in my nightmares tonight‚Ä¶ thanks, algorithm. üëÄ

Give me a coffee, a book, somewhere comfy to sit and watch the world go by.  Disconnected from the real world for a few days with no wifi.  The ship so quiet on port days, such a pleasure.

1mzer2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mzer2r/aitah_for_being_mad_and_sleeping_on_the_couch/,Aitah for being mad and sleeping on the couch over dishes?,"I (30F) moved in with my fiance (31M) about 2 months ago. 

We had an agreement- he handles his cat, I handle my dog. We handle our own dishes, but if I cook for both of us- he does the dishes. 

I cook about 80% of his meals, he cooks his own breakfast most days and leaves the dirty pans and dishes on the stove and counter. 

He uses at least 3-5 cups and mugs a day, I use one, maybe 2 at most. 

I do 100% of the laundry- including picking his laundry up off the floor when we have perfectly good laundry hampers throught the house. If I don't do the laundry, he does his when he's completely out of work clothes or clean underwear. But it's only the bare minimum and it sits in the dryer for days where I either have to take it out and put it away or it's going to sit there in the way of being able to do my own laundry, or towels, or sheets....

Taking out trash has been about 50-50. He stacks things up on top of a trash bin that needs the bag taken out, but if I take it out and put it by the door, he'll take it out. 


But 3 days ago, we had an argument over dishes.  I washed dishes for the third time in a row- our LARGE sink completely filled, the stove with a bunch of pots and pans stacked on it, the counter had dishes stacked, cups with sludge from coffee or soda or sweet tea (i drink water.  Or black tea unsweetened. Thats it) 

Yeah, third time in a row isnt a big deal... except that the time before that, he only did half the sink and left the rest.... and the times he has actually washed the dishes, it takes days, dishes still have food on them because he rushes through and doesn't notice a glob of ketchup (he uses ketchup. I think its disgusting) . 

I told him I'm done being his mother. Im not asking him to do dishes anymore, I'm just skipping to doing them myself, but only cooking for myself, only doing my own laundry, and if I have to clean his dishes to have an empty sink, I'm not asking- I'm skipping straight over asking and going right to being pissed. 

Because he would sooner buy more dishes than clean them on his own and I don't want the roaches from our apartments dumpster having an all you can eat buffet in the sink. 

His excuse during our argument was that I don't soak dishes.  I do. Always have.  (Living on my own, I'd soak any dishes until after dinner then I'd tackle them all) this time, 75% of the dishes were his. Pans with globs of burnt food, bacon grease, dishes with ketchup and solidified previously melted cheese, cups with crusty coffee, sticky soda... every dish that was used by him had to be scrubbed with steel wool (so glad we don't have coated pots and pans) 

After I did the dishes, I went into our room, grabbed my pillow, a blanket, phone, charger, and bedside water bottle, and set up camp for the indefinite future on the couch. 

I didn't say anything, didn't yell. When he asked why, I just said ""dishes"". 

He says I'm ""blowing up over nothing out of nowhere"".

I‚Äôve been living in Maple Ridge for a few years but since I work remote and I also have a side business that‚Äôs all remote, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to meet many people

I‚Äôd love to get more involved in the community and make more friends

I‚Äôve started to sign up for volunteering and such but those processes take some time, in the meantime I thought maybe I could meet some cool people through here! (If you need volunteers for anything lmk as well, perhaps there‚Äôd be a good fit there) 

I work in the tech industry (cybersecurity) and my side business is in the same domain. That‚Äôs definitely one of my passions

Aside from that I wrestle (love wrestling as well). I go to a wrestling club in Vancouver, happy to take you along if we become friends and that interests you. It‚Äôs a group of great/friendly guys and gals. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre just all far from me in Maple Ridge

I‚Äôm also on the spiritual side and meditate a lot so if you‚Äôre on that wavelength we‚Äôll surely have a lot to talk about (I‚Äôm not affiliated with any religion/am not religious) 

Feel free to dm me or I could dm you. No pressure, let‚Äôs talk on chat first and if we click we can grab coffee or do some activity together :)

The asked if we wanted coffee on the way there and if we needed to pick up food on the way home. 

Then today, he texts me: ‚ÄúDo you know where all my cones are at?‚Äù and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúCones? What are those?‚Äù He sends me a picture of combs, and I go, ‚ÄúOh combs! Yes.‚Äù I bring them out to him, and he immediately asks if I‚Äôm making fun of him. No, he literally typed cones, I was confused! (English is his second language, but he‚Äôs been speaking it since childhood‚ÄîI‚Äôd never tease him about that.)

1mzeffv,https://i.redd.it/jmb33ojzq2lf1.jpeg,316 Santa Claus is Mad at Me,"
After 4 weeks as the R5 of Too HOT a Rank 6 alliance, I made it onto Santa‚Äôs naughty list. So how did I get such an honor bestowed upon me?

Well it stated two weeks ago, when we finished 5th. Historically this would have allowed us to take an Armory. Something that we had done twice before. This time the rule changed. Now we had to wait a week. Well If those are now the rules, then ok. (Come to think of it, they never mentioned we could challenge for it.)

So we waited another week. When we showed up, another another alliance had already started to take it and the Santa Claus academy was waiting there too. Santa‚Äôs R4 then sent me a PM asking why our ally (we are an academy) wasn‚Äôt helping? It looked to me like we were sandbagged. (This same alliance blocked our path to progress, and they share the same  corner for their mines. This smells fishy.)

I went to NAP15 chat and sought a rule clarification. I was told that all alliances can battle for all Armories. I was also told I should read the rules. Well the rules aren‚Äôt posted on the official 316 Discord because Santa Claus doesn‚Äôt like the notifications and doesn‚Äôt know how to turn them off, so where would we find them? I accepted that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äòknow‚Äô the rules and I congratulated the other alliances their win.

Despite all of the intentionally vague rule making, we still rallied some of our best players to help defend 316 yesterday during Capital Clash. We live here and 316 is our home. It‚Äôs the right thing to do. It was a long battle. 12 of our best players showed up and gave it our all, including spending speed-ups on heals.

I chose not to go to state Capital Clash today. Too much healing done already. While it was taking place, I read that Santa had changed the rules there too. People got heated and Santa rage deleted NAP15 chat. Dumb decision because the discussion then went public to WC. You look stupid dude!

While eating popcorn as a bystander, the State Farm Rep pops off in chat saying my alliance should have had more than 12 players helping. That‚Äôs a strange way to say thank you. How about next time we don‚Äôt show up then? It seems it‚Äôs not ok to have a job, kids, school or be on vacation. We never ever have more than 15 people on at a time. That‚Äôs my fault Dickhead?

While asking them what they were mad at me about, they continued acting like they were the victims and I was being a bully. What a bunch of pussies! 

After hearing them whine on and on how hard it is for them to be at the top, and we should lick their boots and be thankful, I had enough and called them arrogant narcissists. At that point their petulant leader decided to send the attached email and then burn me. I‚Äôve invested less than a Starbucks coffee in this game, so what do I have to lose?

Well that‚Äôs where being a Hot Head, even if in the right, put me on Santa‚Äôs naughty list. So not only do I get coal for Christmas. He‚Äôs threatening all my allies too. Not that any of them are scared. They are sick of his shit too.

So that‚Äôs the story. I was defending my alliance at every step of the way. I have the receipts to prove it in screenshots. I was going to create a Discord to share with anyone on the server who asked . But I decided narcissist crave larger audiences and that sharing this on Reddit would make Santa Claus much more famous he now.

I‚Äôve always wanted to play a subversive game. This will be fun. I‚Äôve gotten PM‚Äôs of support from several R5‚Äôs. And I‚Äôve even gotten support from inside their own alliance. Their leadership is clearly suffering a crisis. They are now have flooding world chat with their players because they know they screwed the pooch public relations wise when they took it to world chat.

It‚Äôs time to rally the peons who have jobs, kids and school to make their tyrannical rule harder now.

This is such a fun game!

1mzef54,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1mzef54/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_my_cruise/,Things I wish I knew before my cruise,"Got back from the Caribbean Princess to Alaska a week ago. It was my first cruise and I went with family. We also stayed at the Princess Wilderness Lodge in Denali for a couple days. 

In our 16 person group the youngest was 19 and the oldest was late 60s. I‚Äôm 24F for reference so keep that in mind. We had the premium drink package 

Let‚Äôs get into it. 

ROOMS: 
‚Ä¢Saying this first bc I think it‚Äôs most important: I do NOT like how Princess puts the names of guests right on the doorway tablets, with their profile picture if they‚Äôve uploaded one. There are instances where it‚Äôs clearly displayed that a woman is staying in a room by herself. This COMBINED with the fact that the medallions unlock your room door while you‚Äôre still all the way at the other end of the hall‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. Unsafe for guests. 

‚Ä¢My parents had a balcony. It was AMAZING laying in bed and looking at the mountains outside the sliding glass door window. Also bringing breakfast out there. 

‚Ä¢Random but bring one of those small outlet extender attachment things. In most rooms there‚Äôs only two outlets, one in the bathroom and one by the desk and two charging boxes can‚Äôt even fit side by side in one outlet. I was charging my phone in the bathroom each night

 ‚Ä¢The hairdryers in almost all the rooms don‚Äôt work. They‚Äôre super old‚Äîthe kind that‚Äôs attached to the wall, and are just straightup broken in every room we tried. They tell you online not to bring one but you absolutely should. I went out with damp hair several times

‚Ä¢They provide you with a body wash and a shampoo/conditioner ‚Äúhybrid.‚Äù 

‚Ä¢There‚Äôs a great selection of free movies and shows on demand also 

‚Ä¢We noticed that while the stewards clean up the rooms, make the beds and whatnot, they don‚Äôt seem to change the sheets. Not an issue, as it‚Äôs only a week long cruise. Just noting. Off the bat my comforter also had some unfavorable stains on it but it was covered with a topsheet. 

FOOD AND DRINK: 
‚Ä¢The food is alright. Decent. The buffet is equivalent to my college dining hall food honestly. MDRs are a little more upscale. The service is also extremely accommodating. As others here have said, you can get appetizer sizes of pastas. And if you want multiple or more of something, just ask. 

Hashbrowns at breakfast buffet are great. Eggs were usually cold unfortunately but what can you do. Loved going around the corner to Coffee and Cones and getting the vanilla bean latte with a shot of Frangelico as well. Wait time could be a while though and I wasn‚Äôt always patient enough. They also have complimentary ice cream cones I should‚Äôve taken more advantage of. 

RESERVATIONS!!! Make dinner reservations, they fill up quickly. Going with the flow and trying to go impromptu every night got sort of annoying and difficult, especially with large groups. 

‚Ä¢Lots of nights when the MDRs are all booked, the only option for dinner is the buffet unless you want to pay per plate. (Not counting room service + the mini sandwich counter) 

Besides MDRs/buffet we only went to the BBQ place that was I think +$50 per person. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was exceptionally better than the MDRs or worth the additional upcharge though. 

‚Ä¢The buffet closes at 10:30pm but the room service is great. I got complimentary sandwiches and fries delivered a few times at crazy hours of the night. I will say the ham sandwiches are a little stingy but hey they‚Äôre complimentary. There‚Äôs also a small sandwich and coffee shop in the atrium that‚Äôs complimentary and open 24 hours. 

MDRs have good service; Everyone is so nice and incredibly attentive but the staff is just clearly overworked and spread thin. At one point we were seated but not taken care of for 45+ mins in the Coral Dining Room. That being said we were walk ins and they were packed. 

STAFF:
‚Ä¢With so many expenses being ‚Äúincluded‚Äù as in a part of a larger package, it kind of creates an uncomfortable dynamic between staff and patron. People start treating the service as ‚Äúcomplimentary‚Äù as well. Guests feel entitled to certain things because ‚Äúthey paid for it‚Äù but the burden often falls on the staff themselves 

‚Ä¢We talked to a server from Bulgaria who says everyone in her country gets jobs with Princess bc the pay is significantly better than most local options. 

‚Ä¢Someone in my group was told the masseuses only get paid with the tips. If that‚Äôs true I think it‚Äôs crazy considering how expensive the rates are. This would also explain why my massage felt a little halfass towards the end lol 

‚Ä¢EVERYTHING is an upcharge with Princess and they are allllways trying to sell you something. No amount of money is ever going to be enough, they‚Äôll always try for more, it‚Äôs clearly how the employees are trained. Even if you‚Äôre already spending $600 for example, they‚Äôre going to give you a speech on some specific treatment they think will fix whatever they feel is wrong with you. A masseuse tried selling my sister on acupuncture for her sweaty hands lol. 

‚Ä¢What‚Äôs interesting too is that Princess owns most of the jewelry stores off of the ports. The workers are clearly trained to compliment something you‚Äôre already wearing, ask where you got it, and then show you something similar. They also have this ‚Äúfree gift‚Äù thing, where they give you a cheap little charm if you go inside and let them work their predatory magic. I ended up buying two $75 rings bc my sister was so motivated to collect as many ‚Äúfree gifts‚Äù as possible lmao. 

‚Ä¢Pretty sure most of the cruise lines (Princess, Carnival, etc.) are under the same conglomerate which I think is interesting. The illusion of choice in capitalism working its dark magic. 


PRINCESS WILDERNESS LODGE DENALI 
They go third party with excursions so when things go awry they can evade any real responsibility or control. 

Eg: We had ATVing reservations for a group of 10 (purchased months in advance) where the bookings temporarily disappeared. When they were readded, we realized my sister and I had been separated from the group and put on an entirely different day. When we tried to fix it, they told us it wasn‚Äôt possible. Everything was booked and they could only have so many riders per tour guide. 

We just had to take the L on this. They offered no discount or any way to fix it. The nice lady at Guest Services called the manager and tried multiple different things for us. They can really only do so much and getting upset with them isn‚Äôt worth it in my opinion. 

-ALSO our key cards stopped working randomly and we couldn‚Äôt get back into our rooms right before we had to leave for the scheduled ATV excursion. My sister wasn‚Äôt able to get some items she wanted to take with her. 

IN FACT: Before the bus left for the ATV tour, we told the front desk the problem and they gave us new key cards. We RAN back to the room only to discover these cards didn‚Äôt work either. We ended up leaving for the tour without having gotten into our rooms. Luckily it was fixed when we got back. 

The food in the restaurants at the Princess Wilderness Lodge is incredibly overpriced. It‚Äôs good though and portions are big. But I‚Äôm talking $8/slice of pizza kind of expensive. $25 salads. I kind of wished we explored the adjacent resorts for more options. Also they only serve breakfast at Fanny Q‚Äôs until 9:30am which is crazy to me but I‚Äôm not a morning person. 

Okay that‚Äôs it! Thanks for reading and have a good cruise!

The apartment is a four bedroom unit with the Drummond floor plan, and the available space is Bedroom A. Two of the other rooms, Bedrooms C and D, are already occupied by wonderful roommates.

The Standard is one of Eugene‚Äôs newest luxury apartment communities and offers an incredible variety of amenities. Residents have access to a rooftop pool and jacuzzi with a large jumbotron overlooking the city, a fully equipped fitness center, sauna, and indoor rock climbing wall. There is also a golf simulator, dedicated study lounges, and beautifully designed resident common spaces. The building is secure, modern, and designed for student living.

The location is also highly convenient, it‚Äôs a short walk, drive or bike ride to campus, with close access to restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping. When I first signed my lease, this unit was one of the last of its kind available, as the Drummond floor plan is particularly popular. I had been very excited to live here, and while I am disappointed not to be returning, I would love to pass the opportunity on to someone who will enjoy it.

1mzebk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1mzebk4/everyone_will_forget_you_its_just_a_short_phase/,Everyone will forget you : it's just a short phase that passes.," I'm 17 years old, and I'm here to share a small experience that changed how I see people. One time, I was scrolling through Instagram, watching videos of people doing extremely embarrassing and silly things in public. I kept asking myself, ""Why would they do such stupid stuff? For views and followers, maybe?"" That's all I could think about until I saw an Instagram reel by an Egyptian content creator who does ""Rejection Therapy."" His idea was to try 100 new experiences and get rejected. He'd try asking to make his own coffee at a cafe, asking firefighters if he could explore their trucks, etc. As I watched his videos, one after another, I discovered that most of his requests were actually accepted, not rejected. Not only that, but they also brought a smile to the person asking because they tried something new, and to the person being asked because they felt appreciated for their work and effort. I also realized that even if you get rejected once, twice, or three times, eventually you'll be accepted because people are different, and everyone has a unique personality in this vast world. Additionally, rejection will make you stronger, more determined, and more confident in other social situations, whether at work, a wedding, or any other social event. You'll remember that even if you look silly or misunderstood at some point, others will quickly forget. That moment will be buried as if it never happened because everyone has bigger things to deal with than your little moments. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è.

TL;DR :I've learned that the fear of what people think is the biggest obstacle, and most embarrassing moments are forgotten super fast. The most important thing is to dare to try new things without worrying about rejection, because that's what gives you confidence and freedom in your social life.

*  when we go out, he insists on paying for things,  like he literally races me getting our cards ready
* he comes over in the morning before work to have coffee with me
*  ive caught him staring at me for no reason a few times
*  has told me he's been really enjoying getting to know me better and seeing more of my personality 

Now, the reason I cant spend the night at his, is because he has kids, they don't know about me (which is 100% okay in my book) just for context to that. Sometimes he doesn't text me as much for a few days, we still most definitely text every single day though. But it makes me question if he's actually interested or not, even though I know he's very busy (very important day job which he is also on call for after hours, has kids, got a new puppy, is also a volunteer first responder). Is it worth trying to push for some openly agreed upon exclusivity? Or to put a label on us? I feel like my anxiety is playing tricks on my mind and I'm in a game of tug of war with myself over whether he likes me or not

Life has a curious way of teaching us lessons when we least expect them. One of the most profound realizations we can have is understanding that some of our greatest achievements come not from pushing harder, but from knowing when to ease up and let things happen naturally.

## The Paradox of Effort üéØ

Think about the last time you desperately wanted something to work out. Maybe it was a job interview, a relationship, or even trying to remember something on the tip of your tongue. The harder you pushed, the more elusive it became. This isn't coincidence ‚Äì it's a fundamental principle of how effectiveness works in the real world.

When we apply excessive force to delicate situations, we often create the opposite of what we want. It's like trying to thread a needle with shaking hands or attempting to fall asleep by commanding yourself to sleep. The very act of forcing creates tension that works against our goals.

## Learning from Natural Patterns üèπ

Consider how skilled athletes perform at their peak. A basketball player doesn't overthink every shot during a crucial game moment. A pianist doesn't consciously direct every finger movement during a complex piece. They've practiced so much that their body and mind work in harmony, allowing the action to flow naturally when the moment demands it.

This same principle applies to countless areas of our daily lives:

**In Communication** üí¨
- The most meaningful conversations happen when we listen genuinely rather than planning our next response
- Persuasion works better through understanding than through aggressive argumentation
- Difficult topics are best approached with patience rather than urgency

**In Creative Work** üé®
- Breakthrough ideas often emerge during relaxed moments, not during forced brainstorming
- Writers know that forcing words onto paper usually produces inferior content
- Problem-solving frequently happens when we step away from the problem

**In Relationships** ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Trust develops gradually through consistent actions, not through desperate attempts to prove worthiness
- Deep connections form naturally when both people feel comfortable being authentic
- Conflicts resolve more effectively when emotions are allowed to settle first

## The Foundation of Natural Excellence üå±

So what creates this effortless effectiveness? It's built on three key elements:

**Preparation Without Obsession**
Excellence requires dedicated practice and skill development. However, this preparation happens during quiet moments when stakes are low. Musicians practice scales in private. Athletes train when no one's watching. Professionals develop expertise through consistent daily effort over months and years.

**Adaptive Learning**
Progress rarely follows a straight line. Every expert has experienced countless failures, adjustments, and refinements. The key is viewing these setbacks as information rather than defeat. Each attempt provides data about what works and what doesn't, gradually building intuitive understanding.

**Present-Moment Awareness**
When the important moment arrives, all that preparation allows us to respond to current conditions rather than being trapped by predetermined plans. This flexibility enables us to recognize opportunities and adapt to unexpected circumstances.

## Practical Applications for Daily Life üåü

**Professional Situations**
Instead of desperately networking at every opportunity, focus on genuinely connecting with colleagues during regular interactions. Build competence steadily through daily work rather than cramming before big presentations. Let your expertise speak for itself during meetings rather than forcing your ideas into every conversation.

**Personal Growth**
Develop new habits gradually rather than attempting dramatic lifestyle overhauls. Allow yourself to be curious about challenges rather than demanding immediate mastery. Practice skills consistently during low-pressure situations so they're available when needed.

**Decision Making**
Gather information thoroughly, then allow yourself space to process before major choices. Trust the wisdom that emerges from this reflection rather than rushing toward the first acceptable option. Some decisions improve when given time to develop naturally.

## Recognizing the Right Moment ‚ö°

How do we know when to act versus when to wait? This judgment develops through experience, but there are some reliable indicators:

**Green Lights for Action:**
- You feel calm confidence rather than desperate urgency
- Multiple factors seem to align naturally
- The path forward feels clear even if challenging
- You're responding to opportunity rather than creating pressure

**Red Lights for Patience:**
- Anxiety or desperation drives your urgency
- You're fighting against multiple obstacles simultaneously
- The situation feels forced or unnatural
- Others seem resistant or uncomfortable with the pace

## The Compound Effect of Natural Timing üìà

When we align our actions with natural rhythms, the results often exceed what forced effort could achieve. Like a river that gradually carves through rock, consistent gentle pressure over time creates more dramatic change than violent but brief force.

This approach also preserves our energy for situations that truly require intense effort. Some circumstances do demand immediate action and maximum exertion. By not exhausting ourselves forcing inappropriate situations, we maintain capacity for genuine emergencies and opportunities.

## Building Your Natural Timing Skills üéØ

**Daily Observation Practice**
Pay attention to your natural energy patterns throughout the day. Notice when you feel most creative, most analytical, most social. Schedule important activities during your peak periods for those specific types of work.

**Emotional Awareness**
Develop sensitivity to the difference between productive tension and counterproductive strain. Productive tension feels energizing and focused. Counterproductive strain feels desperate and scattered.

**Environmental Sensitivity**
Learn to read social and professional environments. Some moments call for leadership and initiative. Others benefit from patience and listening. Timing often depends more on external conditions than internal desires.

**Long-term Perspective**
Most worthwhile achievements unfold over months or years rather than days or weeks. Build comfort with gradual progress rather than demanding constant dramatic advancement.

## When Patience Isn't Passive üöÄ

Waiting for the right moment doesn't mean sitting idle. It means preparing thoroughly while remaining alert to opportunities. Like a surfer who paddles constantly while waiting for the perfect wave, we can stay active and ready while avoiding premature action.

This active patience involves:
- Continuous skill development
- Relationship building
- Information gathering
- System optimization
- Mental and physical preparation

## The Ripple Effects üåä

People notice when someone operates from natural timing rather than forced urgency. It creates an impression of competence and trustworthiness. Others feel more comfortable collaborating with someone who doesn't create artificial pressure or drama.

This reputation for steady reliability opens doors that aggressive self-promotion cannot. Opportunities often come through referrals from people who appreciate working with someone who makes processes feel easier rather than harder.

## Your Next Steps Forward ‚û°Ô∏è

Starting today, experiment with this approach in low-stakes situations. Notice what happens when you allow conversations to develop naturally rather than pushing toward predetermined outcomes. Observe how your creative work flows when you create space for ideas to emerge rather than forcing them.

Pay attention to your body's signals. Tension often indicates we're pushing against natural timing. Ease and flow suggest we're aligned with optimal conditions.

Remember that mastering natural timing is itself a skill that develops gradually. Be patient with yourself as you learn to recognize and work with these subtle patterns.

The goal isn't to become passive or avoid necessary effort. It's to become more effective by applying energy in harmony with natural patterns rather than against them. This creates better results with less stress and more sustainable long-term success.

I lucked out, I totally get that, but I want to do whatever it is to make sure not only that I keep the job, but am there for more than just a paycheck. Ideally I want to advance at some point. 

Who is in charge of the reviews, is it the supervisor? Because he seemed pretty cool on the phone when we talked. Younger than me for sure, but seemed very relatable which is probably a good thing if he's the one to impress. 

Typically I do not get involved in any office politics. I also do not care about things like people trying to haze me at new jobs, I either laugh at their jokes or ignore them, I never get mad or upset. The reason being as a person the only people who's opinion of me matters to me is me, and the people in my immediate family like my wife.

But I defer to the wisdom of this sub for anything else I can do, and anything else I should not do. And should I brush up on any topics ahead of time, or wait till orientation on the 8th to see what is required? Like Excel or Google Sheets its been a while should I be practicing that?

FOR orientation it says business casual, I know shoes or boots, but how about pants, are jeans okay for orientation or would slacks be better? Sweatshirt or sweater? I hear it can be cold in those rooms. And for anyone that IS a VMF clerk, can I bring coffee to work?

The outpost was burning.

Smoke curled through the shattered domes of Kirell Station, lit by the flicker of plasma fire and the screams of dying servitors. The warlord‚Äôs forces had breached the perimeter, and the last evac shuttle had already dusted off.

Captain Jace Ransom didn‚Äôt care.

He was elbow-deep in rubble, dragging a half-conscious Orion princess out from under a collapsed bulkhead. Her ceremonial gown was torn, her crown cracked, and her attitude still intact.

‚ÄúYou smell like engine grease,‚Äù she muttered.

‚ÄúYou smell like entitlement,‚Äù he shot back, hoisting her upright.

She winced. ‚ÄúMy leg‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, your leg‚Äôs about to get carried.‚Äù

He threw her over his shoulder like a sack of royal potatoes, ignoring her protests. Plasma bolts sizzled past as he sprinted through the wreckage, boots pounding metal and ash.

‚ÄúPut me down!‚Äù she shouted, fists pounding his back.

‚ÄúNot a chance, sweetheart,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúYou want down, you can crawl.‚Äù

They reached the outer corridor‚Äîhalf-collapsed, lit by emergency strobes. Jace kicked open a locker, grabbed a sidearm, and slapped it into her hand.

‚ÄúCover me,‚Äù he barked. ‚ÄúPoint and shoot. Don‚Äôt think.‚Äù

She blinked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never fired‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThen learn fast.‚Äù

He swatted her ass‚Äîhard enough to make her yelp‚Äîand ducked through the breach, firing blind and laughing like a man who‚Äôd finally snapped.

‚ÄúY‚Äôall want a princess?‚Äù he shouted at the incoming hostiles. ‚ÄúCome take her from me!‚Äù

She fired. Missed. Fired again. Hit.

Jace whooped. ‚ÄúAtta girl!‚Äù

They tore through the station like a myth in motion‚Äîone grizzled spacer, one furious princess, and a whole lot of royal bullshit left behind in the flames.

# CHAPTER TWO ‚Äì Eagle‚Äôs Nest

The ship was a relic. A freighter named *Eagle‚Äôs Nest*, older than most moons and twice as stubborn. She had twin thrusters, a belly full of smuggler mods, and a cockpit that smelled like burnt coffee and bad decisions.

Jace dropped Virellia onto the med cot with a grunt. ‚ÄúYou break anything important?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust my dignity.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. That was weighing you down.‚Äù

She glared. ‚ÄúYou slapped me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saved your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou slapped me.‚Äù

He tossed her a ration bar. ‚ÄúEat. You‚Äôre gonna need energy to keep yelling.‚Äù

She threw it at his head.

# CHAPTER THREE ‚Äì Thirty Days of Hell

They ran. Hid. Fought. Slept in shifts. Ate ration paste. Argued about everything.

She hated the ship. He hated her attitude. She complained about the shower. He complained about her perfume. She slept in his bed when the heat failed. He slept on the floor and threw his back out.

He stitched her wounds. She saw his scars. He caught her staring. She caught him staring back.

They didn‚Äôt talk about it.

They just kept flying.

üß≠ *Eagle‚Äôs Nest Dual Logs ‚Äì 30 Days to Orion Prime*

# üìÖ Day 1

**JACE**: She took my bed. I took the floor. She snores like a smug little war trophy. I hate her perfume. I hate her attitude. I hate that I noticed her voice is kinda nice. **VIRELLIA**: The captain is uncouth. His ship is a relic. I claimed his bed. He sulked. I slept. I shall endure this month with grace and minimal eye contact.

# üìÖ Day 2

**JACE**: Shower incident. She walked out naked. I walked in. We locked eyes. She screamed. I dropped a towel. Installing a curtain. And a cold rinse system. **VIRELLIA**: He barged into the hygiene chamber. I was unclothed. He stared. I screamed. He muttered something about bruises. I am compiling a list of grievances.

# üìÖ Day 3

**JACE**: She ate the last caramel bar. Said it was medicinal. I threw a protein cube at the wall. She laughed. I think I‚Äôd burn for that laugh. **VIRELLIA**: I consumed the final caramel ration. He reacted as though I‚Äôd stolen his soul. His tantrum was oddly endearing. I must be sleep-deprived.

# üìÖ Day 4

**JACE**: Taught her to clean her blaster. She asked why I slapped her ass. I said it was tactical. She hit the target. I called it a win. **VIRELLIA**: He insists physical provocation improves combat. He slapped me. I retaliated with precision shooting. He smirked. I glared. Madness has merit.

# üìÖ Day 5

**JACE**: Tried to reclaim my bunk. She threatened to bite. Slept in the cockpit. Woke up with her jacket on me. Smelled like lavender and war crimes. **VIRELLIA**: He attempted to reclaim his quarters. I defended my position. Left my jacket for him. He looked peaceful. I must remain vigilant.

# üìÖ Day 6

**JACE**: She said the ship smells like regret. I said she smells like entitlement. She threw a wrench. I ducked. She missed. Barely. **VIRELLIA**: He insulted my scent. I retaliated with a wrench. He dodged. I missed. I regret nothing.

# üìÖ Day 7

**JACE**: Her leg‚Äôs healing. I scanned it. She didn‚Äôt flinch. I saw the scar. She saw me see it. We didn‚Äôt speak for an hour. **VIRELLIA**: He examined my wound. His hands were rough. His silence was softer. I did not mind it.

# üìÖ Day 8

**JACE**: Blanket war. She hogged it. I tugged. She mumbled ‚Äúwarmth.‚Äù I froze. Didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt breathe. **VIRELLIA**: He tried to steal the blanket. I mumbled. He stopped moving. I think he listened.

# üìÖ Day 9

**JACE**: She cooked. Burned the stew. Blamed the stove. I sneezed spice for ten minutes. She laughed until she cried. **VIRELLIA**: I attempted cuisine. He mocked me. I retaliated with spice. He sneezed. I laughed. It felt... good.

# üìÖ Day 10

**JACE**: Staring contest. She called me creepy. I called her magnetic. She blinked. I didn‚Äôt. She threw a pillow. I caught it. **VIRELLIA**: He stared. I challenged. He won. I threw a pillow. He caught it. I smiled. I am doomed.

# üìÖ Day 11

**JACE**: She asked about my scars. I told her one was from a plasma wrench. She asked if I cried. I said I bled sarcasm. **VIRELLIA**: He spoke of pain with humor. I listened. I did not interrupt. I think he noticed.

**JACE**: She fixed the comms. I didn‚Äôt ask her to. She said she was bored. I said she was useful. She smiled. **VIRELLIA**: I repaired the communications array. He complimented me. I smiled. It felt earned.

# üìÖ Day 13

**JACE**: She sang in the shower. I didn‚Äôt walk in. I listened. It was haunting. **VIRELLIA**: I sang. He didn‚Äôt interrupt. I think he heard. I didn‚Äôt mind.

# üìÖ Day 14

**JACE**: She asked if I ever loved someone. I said I loved my ship. She said that didn‚Äôt count. I said it counts to me. **VIRELLIA**: He spoke of solitude. I spoke of duty. We did not argue.

# üìÖ Day 15

**JACE**: She fell asleep in the cockpit. I covered her with a blanket. She didn‚Äôt wake. I watched her breathe. **VIRELLIA**: I slept. He covered me. I felt safe. I did not say it.

# üìÖ Day 16

**JACE**: She called me ‚ÄúCaptain Crusty.‚Äù I called her ‚ÄúPrincess Pouty.‚Äù We laughed. **VIRELLIA**: He insulted me. I insulted him back. We laughed. It felt like flying.

# üìÖ Day 17

**JACE**: She asked me to teach her evasive maneuvers. I did. She‚Äôs a fast learner. **VIRELLIA**: He taught me to fly. I did not crash. He looked proud.

# üìÖ Day 18

**JACE**: She asked about my family. I said they‚Äôre stars now. She didn‚Äôt speak. Just sat beside me. **VIRELLIA**: He lost everything. I did not offer pity. I offered presence.

# üìÖ Day 19

**JACE**: She made coffee. It was terrible. I drank it anyway. **VIRELLIA**: I brewed coffee. He drank it. I think he lied. I think he cared.

# üìÖ Day 20

**JACE**: She danced in the engine room. Said it helped her think. I watched. I didn‚Äôt interrupt. **VIRELLIA**: I danced. He watched. I let him.

# üìÖ Day 21

**JACE**: She asked if I‚Äôd miss her. I said I‚Äôd miss the noise. She punched my arm. **VIRELLIA**: I asked if he‚Äôd miss me. He deflected. I punched him. He smiled.

# üìÖ Day 22

**JACE**: She fixed the nav system. I said she‚Äôs becoming a mechanic. She said she‚Äôs becoming a warrior. **VIRELLIA**: I repaired the navigation. He called me a mechanic. I called myself a warrior. He agreed.

# üìÖ Day 23

**JACE**: She slept in my bunk. I didn‚Äôt mind. I slept beside her. **VIRELLIA**: I shared his bed. He did not protest. I did not regret.

# üìÖ Day 24

**JACE**: She kissed my cheek. Said it was gratitude. I said it was dangerous. **VIRELLIA**: I kissed him. He looked shaken. I felt steady.

# üìÖ Day 25

**JACE**: She asked if I‚Äôd ever settle down. I said I already did‚Äîon this ship. **VIRELLIA**: He said the ship is home. I think I understand.

# üìÖ Day 26

**JACE**: She cried. I didn‚Äôt ask why. I just held her. **VIRELLIA**: I cried. He didn‚Äôt ask. He held me. I didn‚Äôt want him to let go.

# üìÖ Day 27

**JACE**: She called me ‚ÄúJace.‚Äù Not ‚ÄúCaptain.‚Äù Not ‚Äúroughneck.‚Äù Just Jace. **VIRELLIA**: I called him by name. It felt right.

# üìÖ Day 28

**JACE**: She said she‚Äôs scared to go home. I said I‚Äôm scared to lose her. **VIRELLIA**: He said he‚Äôs scared. I said I am too.

# üìÖ Day 29

**JACE**: She kissed me. I kissed her back. **VIRELLIA**: I kissed him. He didn‚Äôt hesitate.

# üìÖ Day 30

**JACE**: We walked into the court.

# CHAPTER THIRTY ‚Äì The Court of Catastrophe

The Grand Hall of Orion Prime was a cathedral of crystal and judgment. Spires of starlight arched overhead, refracting twin suns into a kaleidoscope of pomp. Nobles lined the balconies in robes that shimmered with bioluminescent arrogance. The air reeked of incense, expectation, and centuries of unspoken superiority.

And then the doors exploded open.

Captain Jace Ransom strode in like a man who‚Äôd just wrestled a warlord, kissed a princess, and still hadn‚Äôt had his morning coffee. His flight jacket was scorched. His boots were muddy. His hair was a mess of plasma-static and defiance.

Behind him limped Princess Virellia‚Äîred-haired, green-skinned, radiant, and absolutely furious. She wore a torn flight suit, a ceremonial sash she‚Äôd found in the cargo bay, and an expression that could melt titanium.

The nobles gasped.

The High Matron clutched her pearls.

The Oracle dropped his scroll.

Jace didn‚Äôt bow.

Didn‚Äôt kneel.

Didn‚Äôt wait.

He marched straight to the dais, looked the High Matron dead in her triocular gaze, and said:

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had *zero time* for your royal bullshit since the day your daughter got shot saving my ass.‚Äù

Silence.

The Oracle blinked.

The High Matron whispered, ‚ÄúBy the stars‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI dragged her home through fire, sabotage, and ration paste. I stitched her leg with duct tape. I gave her my bed. I slapped her ass to get her to shoot straight. I threw her over my shoulder and threw my back out lifting a beam off her. And I did it all without a single thank-you or a decent cup of coffee.‚Äù

Gasps. One noble fainted. Another vomited into a jeweled goblet.

Virellia stepped forward, eyes blazing.

""You Slapped my ass""

""Made you shoot right didn't it?""

""I had to sleep in your bed""

""I WAS ON THE FLOOR""

""you healed me""

""you were hurt""

""YOU SAW ME NUDE"" 

""Yeah when you are hurt i need to see what i'm fixing""

""NOT  THEN THE SHOWER YOU SAY ME NUDE AND STARED""

""YOU FUCKING POSED""

""YOU ARE A LOWBROW ROUGHNECK""

""YOUR DAMN RIGHT I AM, AND THE LOWBROW ROUGHNECK SAVED YOUR POMPOUS, BITCHY, ENTILTLED, SEXUALY REPRESSED ROYAL ASS""

The Binding Scroll lit up.

The ancient runes flared.

The court gasped again.

The Oracle stepped forward, voice trembling. ‚ÄúThey have completed the Rite.‚Äù

Jace frowned. ‚ÄúWhat rite?‚Äù

Virellia‚Äôs voice dropped. ‚ÄúThe Honorbonding.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a real thing?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúRescue under fire. Shared quarters. Healing of wounds. Public declaration. Emotional clash. You did every step.‚Äù

Jace turned to the nobles. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre married now?‚Äù

The Oracle nodded. ‚ÄúBy ancient law. By accident. By fire.‚Äù

Jace turned to Virellia. ‚ÄúYou still think I‚Äôm a roughneck?‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúYou still think I‚Äôm sexually repressed?‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúOnly when you‚Äôre not shooting.‚Äù

She stepped closer. ‚ÄúYou gonna slap my ass again?‚Äù

He leaned in. ‚ÄúOnly if you hesitate.‚Äù

The Binding Scroll burst into flame.

The nobles screamed.

The stars blinked.

We had an argument and I am now afraid to exist in my own apartment because she threatened to fight me physically.,"I (24f) have lived in the same 4 bedroom apartment for almost 6 years now. I‚Äôve had a lot of different roommates and the vast majority of them have all been pretty chill, the worst I had to deal with was a roommate who would leave dishes in the sink for weeks  (unless I did them) and steal my and other people‚Äôs food. I thought that was as bad as it could get but fuck was I wrong. I currently feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells in my own home. 

I‚Äôve been here 6 years. Roommate A, 3.5 years. Roommate B, 2 years. Roommate C, 8-ish months. We were all cool with each other, we‚Äôd go out to clubs, parties, dinners, hell, we‚Äôd even all go to the laundromat or grocery shop together. We shared food, cooked for each other, shared clothes, celebrated holidays, birthdays, job promotions- we were very close. 

A couple of months ago roommate C has to move out for a job opportunity, and we needed someone to fill his room ASAP. Roommate A said he had a friend who was in need of a room, and I decided to roll with it. Fast forward a few weeks. A texts the group that his friend (we‚Äôll call her D for continuity purposes) was going to move a few things in since she had to leave her previous spot before she was able to move into the room in my apartment. Fine, I thought. 

About 3 days before C moved out, I left my room one morning to find the living room packed with boxes, bags, furniture, and other assorted things. ‚ÄúHow the hell is she going to fit all that in one room?‚Äù I remember thinking. 

C moves out and D starts ‚Äúofficially‚Äù moving in. 

And then the cleanliness rules hit. 

-No dishes are ever to be left in the sink, not for an hour, not for half a day, certainly not overnight. 

If we left so much as a small plate in the sink, we‚Äôd wake up to a paragraph text from D telling us to do our dishes because she doesn‚Äôt like the ‚Äúbad energy that dirty dishes bring‚Äù

-nobody can touch her groceries

Somehow she noticed that I used a scoop of her coffee one morning and again, sent us a paragraph about not touching her groceries. This has always been a sharing household unless otherwise specified. Eggs, coffee, milk, bread, rice, etc all get shared and when we‚Äôre running low? Someone replaces it. 

Every time we leave a little water on the bathroom counter, paragraph. Leave a spoon in the sink? Paragraph. Don‚Äôt take the trash out right away? Paragraph. 

Now for the real problem. My mom is about to be visiting, so I need the living room clear so I can set up the air mattress for her. The roommate has been here for about 2 months now, and has still not unpacked all her things, my living room is full of boxes and piles of her things. I‚Äôve been asking for a whole month for her to put her things in her room, none of us can use the living room because of all of her things. She constantly makes excuses. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have money for a storage unit.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have room to put in in my room right now‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have money to buy storage for my room to put it away.‚Äù MEANWHILE

i left a bag of my vintage/sentimental clothes I intended to sell/ put in my room, in the living room. It was one big tote bag, I tucked it away in the corner, and due to me not being able to get to it due to the stacks of her stuff in the way, it was there for about a few weeks. I finally decided I wanted one of the items out of the bag, and so I went in the living room to get it. Fucking behold, it‚Äôs gone. I started sobbing. She comes out, I ask her where my bag went, she says she got rid of it. I ask why, and she says ‚Äúwell if you didn‚Äôt want it gone, you should have put it in your room. You can cry about it all you want but it‚Äôs gone now.‚Äù And then she shuts down and won‚Äôt even look at me. I ran off to my room crying. MEANWHILE SHE HAS HAD OUR LIVING ROOM FULL OF HER BOXES FOR TWO MONTHS. 

Fast forward, it‚Äôs now last Friday. I remind everyone that my mom is coming and I need the living room cleared. 

Nothing moves. 

Fast forward again to this afternoon. 

Nothing has moved. 

Mind you this whole time she has been making these weird cleaning demands to make her comfortable because ‚ÄúI was just raised that way, it‚Äôs just respectful‚Äù

I see her in the kitchen and ask if everything is gonna be out of the living room like I requested. She says ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll try but I don‚Äôt have room so I‚Äôll probably just stack it all in the corner. 

IM sorry‚Ä¶ WHAT? No???? So I tell her that no it all needs to be in her room. She says ‚Äúwell okay, but also this air mattress thing? Yeah no this is a public space, so your mom is gonna have to put it away every morning so I can sit in the living room because I need sunlight, my room doesn‚Äôt get very much.‚Äù I said, well, you can still sit on the couch, not like it‚Äôs that different than you having all your boxes all over the living room. Then we got into a screaming match because she completely invalidated my position. Then she made fun of me for crying. Got my other roommate involved. Made him try to take her side. Made me feel so crazy that I started crying, and then said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt talk to anyone who cries like this, I‚Äôm not going to acknowledge you even exist anymore, I can‚Äôt deal with you.‚Äù

I stormed off to my room, slammed my door, kept sobbing, and then a few seconds later, she‚Äôs on the phone ranting about me to her fucking friend about how insane and disrespectful I am. And she wonders why she hardly has any friends and can‚Äôt keep a job. I started yelling at her thru my door because she was entirely misrepresenting the situation. She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never speak to anyone who raises their voice at me. Fuck her. She‚Äôs crazy. She hasn‚Äôt changed since 5 years ago (that‚Äôs in reference to a fight we had, a long story‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She then threatened to physically fight me, and so I ran out of the apartment and didn‚Äôt come home for 2 hours as I just wandered around the city crying. 

My other roommate says he‚Äôll evict her (she‚Äôs subletting, not on the lease like him and I are) but he says he‚Äôll tell her she has until sept 15. So now I just have to live in discomfort and fear for the next few weeks. Shes also a self proclaimed ‚Äúwitch‚Äù but says I‚Äôm not even worth her energy to curse, that I‚Äôll face the wrath of her ancestors and I‚Äôll get what‚Äôs coming to me‚Ä¶ as if I believe in any of that‚Ä¶

My mom gets here tomorrow and I don‚Äôt even know what to do. All her shit is still in the living room, so I can‚Äôt set up the air mattress. She left the apartment at some point when I was gone and hasn‚Äôt been back since, she‚Äôs probably staying at a friend‚Äôs place. No nothing will move from the living room. She‚Äôs about to make my life a living hell I just know it. I‚Äôm scared to even leave my room. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",1,1756087076.0,badroommates,5,0.67,False
1mze4f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1mze4f6/lightheaded_and_dizzy_while_hiking/,Lightheaded and dizzy while hiking,"My husband and I took a short hike on Saturday, leaving before breakfast to ensure a parking spot at the trailhead. Beforehand, I had my coffee (with coconut milk and sugar) and water with electrolytes. We took water along on the hike, but since it was less than two miles (500' elevation gain), I didn't bother to pack snacks. On the way back, I totally hit a wall. I'm not in great shape, so I'm used to getting out of breath on hills, but this was next level. I was lightheaded, seeing spots in my vision, and having to stop every dozen steps or so. I don't \*think\* it was dehydration, since I was sipping water the whole time. Maybe it was low blood sugar from not eating breakfast beforehand? It was such a short hike, I hadn't been worried about it. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I know I goofed by not eating my high-protein breakfast ahead of time. But is it protein I need for energy, or is it carbs? My athletic husband tells me that the digestive system shuts down during exercise, so protein should come after. What are your thoughts? 

We're going to be doing more hiking in a couple of weeks, and now I'm nervous. Other than being sure to eat and hydrate, is there anything else I should keep in mind?

I mean I‚Äôm not a small gal by any means, so the weight loss isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúscary‚Äù thing. I just really don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve changed my diet/lifestyle THAT much. I don‚Äôt eat much, maybe one to two meals a day, I might not be eating as much during those meals as I used to, but I drink a lot of my calories(soda, juice, coffee, etc), and still do!! (die hard Dr. Pepper lover here) I have noticed I am a lot more active, but not like ‚Äúworking out‚Äù active mainly just cleaning, maintaining yard work more than before, and crafting/decorating. Like I said, I‚Äôm not a small gal, and my weight is something I‚Äôve always sort of struggled with.

So Ive learned to accept my size and just take it for what it is. I‚Äôm not complaining, just curious, does the weight loss slow down?? Is it something I might need to keep an eye on down the road?? Is Vyvanse really just a magic pill that makes me feel good, and lose weight without feeling like I‚Äôm sacrificing my young adulthood to do so???

I stumbled across this super cute little Indonesian coffee shop on Lombard Street called Kopiko Caf√© Coffee, and wow I think I found one of the city‚Äôs hidden gems.

I ordered a Kopi Pandan (first time ever) and honestly, I‚Äôve never had anything like it before. It‚Äôs kind of hard to describe the flavor. It‚Äôs smooth, rich, slightly sweet but not in the way you‚Äôd expect. It‚Äôs really unique compared to the usual lattes/cappuccinos around town.

The spot itself has a cozy, tucked-away vibe that makes it feel like a secret you want to keep but also want everyone to know about. Definitely recommend checking it out if you‚Äôre into trying new coffee experiences.

Ten thousand hours. 

With a release date of 21 August 2012, I've been playing for 4761 days, or 418 days if you convert my game time into 24 hour blocks. That's over 4000 days that my brain has been consumed by one activity. Thinking about. Breathing about. Living about. Standing in the kitchen making a cup of coffee, and hearing the match accept sound. Quickly rushing to your desk only to realise the computer isn't even turned on. 

Ten thousand ü•≥

This is excluding the 2000+ hours on alt accounts.   
Or the fact in 2019 having racked up thousands of hours on GTA.

Ten, thousand hours. On a single task. 

The countless nights falling asleep, dreaming of competitions won at local events. Waking up and immediately jumping into queue. The friends I've met along the way, even if we don't talk anymore, those moments will always be remembered. The sheer joy of staying up later than you were because you finally met a group at 2am that were lively and happy to have you apart of their night. 

I've long forgotten why, or how. 

Yet I still play. 

Probably for a long time still. 

I have to ask, though. What have YOU done that's consumed so much time? 

The knowledge of intricacies, the ins and outs, the history, the lore, the experiences. 

One of my favorite, repeated comments from team mates will always be ""why are you stairing through walls???"" this would be due to listening for sound queues and tracking movement. I just find it funny whenever someone asks. 

Another one would be ""you seem to really know this game, majority of people i watch just diddle around, but you seem to actually understand the game""

Can't forget this one either ""where are your skins, you have no skins!!!!""

And lastly, but not least ""you have 10k hours and youre still a bot, LMAO"" ",0,1756086792.0,counterstrike2,4,0.33,False

Can I grab random people out of my societies?  
Can I just message them out of the blue, or do I have to build up to it first?  
How often can I ask without appearing weird/creepy/rude/pushy?  
How do I ask my female friends without accidentally looking like I‚Äôm asking them out?  
How do I get a bigger group going?  
How do I set up for big events, like all those house parties I see everyone else holding?

Not sure what kind of tale yet but one can only dream these days.
   Recently lost love and this one took a pice of me. Moving and starting a new life is rough but what can you do. Almost settled in but its hard  when you've been with someone for so long you forget how to life without them. Even somthing as simple as leaving the house for coffee usually a daily thing that brought me joy, feels like pushing a boulder.
   Starting from scratch this time for better or worse. New place, new circle of friends, new me.
Lucky enough to meet a few peers nearby unknowingly keeping me from being completely reclusive. Schedules are rough nowadays with the u.s. falling apart and all. Like me üêà‚Äç‚¨õÔ∏è. 
Living alone again does take getting used to. Luckily im not completely alone. I do have a doggo.
   When I am not working im trying to unpack everything. All this space to myself seemed like a dream but it brings me great sorrow. I miss the date nights, the cute laughs behind smiles that made the world worth living in. Falling asleep on movies together. And the dreams...

   Aaand reality, not much to unpack now though hard when each box contains fractions of memory's to priceless to throw away. I bought some new furniture and decor. It is nice decorating with complete freedom but it still seems, not... home.
   Family is mostly out of the picture but some check in once In a while. Work schedule sucks with everything going on but once I am settled in I will have more time to meet new people.
   I love being alone as much as the next shut in however this time being alone is hard. With some down time I've picked up a few old hobbies but still hard pushing through.

I really love anime and can geek out about for hours, my favorite is AOT followed by Naruto (one piece enjoyers are not welcome lol), i like fantasy stuff as well so Game of thrones, House of dragons or Vikings are also another thing i love. For video games i am kinda of in slump especially trying to balance work, gym and family, but i mainly play league of legends, mainly play support but will try to learn a new role soon, hit me if you even just want to play! I love deep talks especially about life and i am very open minded and can always try to and will probably relate to your situation. I do come with some emotional baggage not from relationships but just life in general and i am working on it in therapy. Ideally you would be Minnesota or somewhere close by cause i would love to meet someday for coffee, walk or maybe even a cute date if we get that far lol. If any of this resonated with you feel free to message me! I am located near zumbrota. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

I chuckled, uneasy. ‚ÄúDo you ever get that feeling,‚Äù I glanced over my shoulder, ‚Äúlike someone‚Äôs following you?‚Äù

The neighborhood was quiet‚Äî making every sound sharper around us.

‚ÄúNot really?‚Äù He laughed.

But I swore I heard something‚Äîan extra step, out of rhythm with our own. My laugh came out nervous. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. I heard something.‚Äù

He bumped my shoulder. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll protect you. Big scary Chris will wrestle *any* creep.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I laughed, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be the first one running.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. I‚Äôd tackle him. Kick him in the shins. You‚Äôd be impressed.‚Äù He smiled.

Another flickering streetlight stretched our shadows. I laughed but hugged my jacket tighter.

‚ÄúThanks for walking me home,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúIt just feels *safer* with someone, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. What kind of friend would I be letting you walk alone?‚Äù

A branch cracked behind us. I jerked, nerves crawling. ‚ÄúOh relax, Maya,‚Äù he said after a weird pause. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs here but us.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhy the pause?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly because I was picturing it. You, *clinging* to me, whispering, ‚ÄòSave me, Chris,‚Äô‚Äù he imitated my voice.

I laughed, rolling my eyes. The road seemed endless ahead, every block dragging on. ‚ÄúWhy does it feel longer tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you keep thinking about it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFear stretches things out. But you‚Äôre fine with me, Maya.‚Äù

We fell into silence. Our footsteps echoed in the emptiness. ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs weird?‚Äù I started, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even remember when we started hanging out like this. I mean‚Ä¶ We haven‚Äôt really hung out before have we?‚Äù

He smiled. ‚ÄúSure, we have.‚Äù

I looked at him. 

‚ÄúRemember last month?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWe hung out at the coffee shop, well kind of‚Äîyou couldn‚Äôt get your umbrella to close. I helped.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWell, yeah‚Ä¶ but‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúAnd after class that one day, you broke your calculator. I was there with a new one‚Ä¶ *remember*?‚Äù

I nodded slowly. But the more he spoke, the stranger it felt. Because when I pictured those moments, he wasn‚Äôt with me exactly‚Äîjust kinda there. At the coffee shop. At my school.

I turned back toward the sidewalk‚Äîa quiet realization slowly chilling me: I‚Äôd only asked him to walk me home *because* he‚Äôd always been there. Helping me. Warm‚Ä¶ But truthfully‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt really know him at *all*. I stopped walking. 

‚ÄúChris,‚Äù I whispered.

The streetlight hummed. His face slipped into shadow. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt *ruin* it,‚Äù he said softly.

My skin crawled. ‚ÄúRuin what?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen Maya,‚Äù his tone was calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been around‚Äîhelping you, watching you. Getting to *know* you. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm glad you finally trusted me tonight. I can‚Äôt wait to see where you live.‚Äù

I stumbled back, throat dry. ‚ÄúWait‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShhh.‚Äù His voice was almost tender. ‚ÄúJust keep walking‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes gleamed in the light. ‚ÄúBesides‚Ä¶You said it yourself‚Äîyou feel safer with someone around. And I‚Äôve *always* been around‚Ä¶ You just didn‚Äôt realize it.‚Äù He hissed a smile, ‚ÄúNow *walk.*‚Äù

So, some back story for this is needed so let's get to it. In my opinion I'm the black sheep of the family. My family is my older sister, my mom(f44), and my nephew (unimportant to the story). it's not a big family most of my other family doesn't live with us or is serving our country. Well with how I am constantly being treated I don't feel like they love or care about me. for example, my mom took me to the doctor about a month or two ago due to some lady issues. the doctor told me I NEEDED to get an ultra sound due to him thinking I either have a cyst in my ovaries, or something that's common in my family, endometriosis (basically ruins your ovaries , looks webby, makes you infertile, and can cause really bad problems throughout the rest of your body) well, I still haven't gone and I can't go alone because I've dealt with something in hospitals that have lowkey traumatized me, my mom just refuses to take me because ""there's sick people"" . and it's not just that, I'm constantly being ignored, constantly be little'd (called names and told I'm never going to make it in the world and made fun of for mental diagnoses and eating disorders), and the one that has to do with today, I'm constantly being forgotten. they go on family outings together, they'll go shopping together, they'll go to my mom's boyfriend's pool together. but me, oh I'm left home. now I will admit I do sleep a lot, it has to do with a depression episode I'm going through. But they don't even wake me up. they say they do but never can but I'm a fairly easy person to wake up, literally if someone opens a door, I jump awake. so, I know for a fact they don't even take a step in my room to try. well today I woke up around 12pm, a normal time for me to wake up and I realized they were gone. well, its 99 degrees today which is hot as hell for where I am, so I automatically assumed they were at the pool, I didn't care much. when they got home, I noticed they had drinks. it's from a coffee place around here and I kind of got a little upset. I got upset because yesterday I had practically begged my mom for some caffeine since we were all out of all forms of caffeine at that moment. I practically had to beg and beg and beg and she still said no. Well, I asked my sister where she got it, and she told me that coffee place because my mom had suggested it. So, this is where I got even more upset. I don't have a job I can't pay for things so when I ask it's a no but when my sister, a 23-year-old with 2 jobs (one is for fun the other is a property manager, she makes decent money) ask it's a yes?  well, I got upset and went to go upstairs to take some time to myself and my sister started going off on me about how I was being stupid and dumb and how I should just go up to my room since she didn't want me around her and she didn't want to see my face. like girl...what? wasn't I literally already doing that? well now I'm in my room and I do admit I feel a little silly for a drink being the thing that makes me crash out but it's not just that, I guess I just feel hurt for being always forgotten and ignored and it just hurts really like why have a kid if you're not going to treat her like ""her first baby"" like my mom likes to call my sister. I'm really just hurt is all it comes down to. But AIO for getting mad about a drink my sister and mom had?

I wonder if my SIL listens to your show - if so, hey girl let‚Äôs keep this between us and try to laugh it off ü§£ Sorry in advance this is on the longer side. 

My (29F) husband (35M) and I live far away from my MIL. He is a mama‚Äôs boy & loves her dearly - I do too - but they don‚Äôt have a relationship where they‚Äôre necessarily very close or talk often, or about serious stuff. She is a lovely person, but can be a little aloof and set in her ways. Up until now I‚Äôve never had an issue with her and have always enjoyed our visits. 

Important context: my husband and I are starting the IVF process. I‚Äôve always known I would need to use science or explore alternative options for family planning since I have many health conditions to factor in. My husband has always wanted to be a dad and we discussed a long time ago that we may never have biological kids. However we now have access to some fertility funding through my employer but only guaranteed access to that $ for the next few on the, so I figured let‚Äôs given it a shot. In doing so, we found out we‚Äôre also both carriers for a devastating genetic disease. So we‚Äôve decided to test our embryos for said disease. We asked all living parents to please get a genetic test for us, as that‚Äôs what our clinic‚Äôs lab required. We did offer to reimburse for the bill if it was expensive. 

We haven‚Äôt seen my MIL in a while and planned a vacation where we‚Äôd stay with her. It was a balance of doing our own thing, catching up with friends, and spending time with her. Let‚Äôs call my MIL Cathy. 

The second we get to her house, Cathy tells us she was just speculating with her daughter on the phone (my SIL, let‚Äôs call her Sarah) that we came in town to finally tell her the good news!! My husband, a darling, jumps in and says to please keep waiting because it‚Äôll be a while and we have our own timeline and journey. She notices I‚Äôm not really engaging in the conversation and takes that as me trying to not ‚Äúspoil the surprise‚Äù before dinner the following night with Sarah. She starts jumping up and down and says, OMG you‚Äôre already pregnant aren‚Äôt you omg omg!! 
Mind you, her son JUST said ‚Äúkeep waiting it‚Äôll be a while‚Äù and I‚Äôm drinking a cocktail that she offered to make me. Weird. 
Very flatly I said, no I am not. 
Then, she reminds us, SPEAKING OF: she has the medical bill from her blood test that she needs us to pay. My husband tries to shut her down so we can move on and said ‚Äúyes we will take care of it but we are trying to relax and enjoy our vacation‚Äù. 

The next morning. As we are trying to enjoy breakfast and coffee together, she takes out of her purse an envelope: what is clearly an opened piece of mail. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs that bill. They texted me today to remind me it‚Äôs overdue.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit I wasn‚Äôt very graceful and snatched it out of her hand, took out my husband‚Äôs FSA card from his wallet and made a point to say this can be the last bill we pay with the card for the calendar year because we‚Äôre expecting a $1,200 charge from our clinic next month which will max out the FSA funds for now. My husband dug his nails into my leg under the table as if to say: please keep it cool and keep the peace. I know that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd prefer. His mom can be stubborn and we see her so infrequently. I let it slide. 
Again, the issue wasn‚Äôt that she asked us to pay the bill at all. We offered and we meant it. But we had do it at breakfast? She had it in her purse ready to go? She couldn‚Äôt have pulled her son aside later that day and asked in private if she was so stressed about it? But also keep in mind - while Cathy is not rich, Cathy is certainly not poor. 

The following day. We decide to go to the local botanic gardens as I wanted to enjoy our time in her city. She insists on wearing a ‚Äúbest grandma‚Äù shirt - the shirt one of her older children gave her to announce their pregnancy (oh yea - also keep in mind this woman already has a grandchild and ANOTHER ON THE WAY). I don‚Äôt say anything to her, but this pisses me off - it‚Äôs so tone deaf! Clearly, pregnancy is a very sensitive topic for me and I don‚Äôt want to discuss it! But it‚Äôs just a t-shirt. Right? Well long story short the whole trip the only photos we got with her, she‚Äôs wearing that stupid grandma shirt. And I just know if this photo ends up on FB the extended family will assume - until corrected - that it‚Äôs an announcement photo. 
I tried to tell my husband how I felt and he told me I was being overly sensitive about the shirt but did ultimately agree the way the bloodwork bill was out of line. 

Anyway it was mostly just a lot of small comments here and there during the trip. My husband tried to shut her down but never by directly saying something like ‚Äúhey mom - stop asking about grandkids.‚Äù Always beating around the bush. Because that‚Äôs just like everyone from that city - so freaking passive aggressive. And I know it‚Äôs hard to fight with a parent or confront them. 

On our last day, Cathy even made a snide remark about how a ‚Äúgrand baby on her chest would just be the best feeling right now‚Äù. I literally had to bite my tongue. 

Husband and I agreed next time we go out to see Cathy, he needs to set the tone & ground rules with her beforehand. It‚Äôs all water under the bridge and we survived. 

Well I go on FB today and this is what Cathy said to a family member who was asking about Sarah and her partner. (Censored screenshot attached)
Cathy is just shameless. Freaking boomers, man. 

That‚Äôs it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è rant over.

1mzdl8p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzdl8p,Reasons why I believe that Fuwa san is not the true antagonist,"Reason 1
The Irony of the ""Accidental Cupid""
From a narrative perspective, this act is the ultimate character irony. Fuwa-san believed the money would give him a way to stay connected to Sachiko. By financing the ""Family Cafe"" after Hayato's grandfather's death, he likely thought he was buying a place in her life, or at least a part of Sachiko's dream. He saw this loan as an act of control, a way to bind her to him and demonstrate his superiority over his deceased rival, who had failed to provide him with such financial security.

However, rather than gaining affection or dominance, this act makes him the unwitting architect of his own downfall. Without that money, the caf√© wouldn't have existed, and without it, Hayato and Ami wouldn't have had a common ground, nor a legacy to uphold together. Fuwa-san, in his attempt to possess Sachiko's dream, became the catalyst that united the next generation in a bond of love and community‚Äîthe very values ‚Äã‚Äãhe couldn't obtain. It is the ultimate example of his failure to understand the true richness of human bonds, believing that everything can be acquired or manipulated with money.

An Analysis of Personal Tragedy
From a social and personal perspective, this loan is at the heart of Fuwa-san's tragedy. It demonstrates that, despite having everything, he lived his entire life obsessed with the one thing that was denied him. His resentment is so deep that it compels him to act in contradictory ways: he performs an act of apparent kindness, but with a selfish and possessive intention.

This action condemns him to being a ""poor king"" because his generosity is, in reality, an act of self-deception. He is incapable of giving selflessly, and his gift becomes the chain that binds him to a past he cannot break. In his mind, the coffee and Sachiko's legacy are a debt Hayato must repay. In reality, his ""gift"" becomes the symbol of his defeat, the constant proof that the love he sought could not be bought, only inherited through a genuine connection.

Reason 2

Fuwa-san's grandson's attack on the mayor, unaware of his position or his alliance with Hayato, is the ultimate proof that the ""Poor King's"" tragedy is not just a matter of spirit, but that his real empire is crumbling.

This reckless action reveals that Fuwa-san's obsession with his past rival has come at a massive cost to his own legacy. While he is blinded by resentment, the next generation of his family has lost touch with the world of elite power figures. They lack the cunning and strategic knowledge required to maintain their position.

Fuwa-san's family is fighting a war on a battlefield they don't understand. Their lack of knowledge about the alliance between the mayor and Hayato demonstrates that their information networks are outdated and their strategic intelligence nonexistent.

In essence, this last point solidifies the conclusion that Fuwa-san is not an invincible monster. He is a tragic figure, so consumed by his personal battle of 50 years ago that he has allowed his own kingdom to fall into ignorance and irrelevance, making his defeat not only inevitable, but deserved.

And that also proves that Fuwa-san didn't know the mayor was related to Hayato. My question is, how does he find out if the mayor was important to Hayato and also his strongest ally, suggesting someone has been talking to Fuwa-san?

Reason 3

Analysis of Fuwa-san's Attacks
Fuwa-san's attacks are not those of a common profit-seeking businessman. They are acts of psychological warfare designed to humiliate and dominate. Rather than a direct and efficient business strategy, his methods are personal and motivated by resentment.

The Nature of the Offensive
The character's attacks focus on the individual, not the business itself. He mocks Hayato, criticizes his stance, and compares him unfavorably to his grandmother, directly attacking his pride and connection to his heritage. The offer to buy the property at an absurdly high price is not a good-faith negotiation, but rather a declaration of superiority. He sought to force Hayato to submit to his power, to humble himself, and to admit that his grandmother's inheritance was worthless compared to money. The use of third parties, such as a team of attackers, is a strategy to maintain distance and manifest his power through others, intimidating and undermining his opponents without having to confront them directly.

Purpose and Narrative Function
The goal of his attacks goes beyond the commercial; they are the manifestation of a 50-year wound and his desperate attempt to rewrite history. Through them, Fuwa-san desperately seeks to prove that his money and influence are the true source of power in the world. His aggressive methods are an attempt to compensate for what he lacks: genuine affection and respect.

In conclusion, Fuwa-san's attacks are not the actions of a villain at the height of his power, but the blows of a desperate and resentful man who, in his futility, becomes the architect of the very victory he seeks to prevent.

And that rules out that he was the one responsible for burning the original cafe and besides defaming the mayor there is someone else in this who is playing harder about it.

reason 4

Fuwa-san's Founding Defeat and Humiliation
The event that marked Fuwa-san's life, giving him his motivation and shaping his tragic destiny, was not a financial or political defeat. It was a personal and existential humiliation: Hayato's grandfather beat him at the one thing his money couldn't buy.

The Origin of Resentment
The humiliation lay not in Hayato's grandfather being more powerful or richer, but in the fact that he was chosen by Sachiko despite lacking Fuwa-san's resources and social status. The grandfather's triumph demonstrated that genuine affection, a person's heart, and love have a value that cannot be measured or acquired with money. For Fuwa-san, a man who has built an empire based on power and acquisition, this was a devastating revelation. The defeat not only robbed him of the woman he loved, but also shattered his worldview.

Humiliation as the Center of Life
This defeat becomes the driving force of his entire life, consuming him with a resentment that he has never been able to heal. His current attacks on the caf√© and Hayato are nothing more than a desperate attempt to recapture that moment. He seeks to humiliate Hayato to show that his grandfather's legacy is worthless, trying to prove, finally, that money is the only thing that matters. However, his inability to understand the value of human connections condemns him to relive the same humiliation over and over again.

In the end, Fuwa-san's defeat by Hayato's grandfather is the wound that defines his existence. It is the moment he became a Poor King, a man who, despite having everything, lost the only thing that was truly worthwhile.

In summary

The fundamental reason that explains Fuwa-san's entire character and his actions is his inability to overcome the past. It's not money, power, or malice that motivates him, but a deep and persistent resentment that has consumed his life.

The character has been emotionally stuck in a single moment: his defeat by Hayato's grandfather. Every decision he's made since then has been a futile attempt to rewrite that history. The Original Sin of giving the loan to Sachiko was an act to keep his connection to her alive, a way to possess a part of the life that slipped away.

His attacks on Hayato aren't business moves, but rather blows aimed at a ghost. His obsession with Hayato's humiliation and ownership of the caf√© is a war against the legacy of the rival who defeated him, in a desperate attempt to prove that he was always the true winner. His tragedy is that while he's fighting a battle from 50 years ago, his own power and legacy are fading in the present, a point evidenced by his family's deteriorating social standing.

At its core, Fuwa-san is a figure condemned by his own memory. His reason for being is a defeat he refuses to accept, turning his vast wealth into a gilded prison and himself into the king of a kingdom that has lost its purpose.

In other words, Fuwa-san is merely the story's antagonist; the villain will appear in this story arc, and we'll also learn how she discovered the cafe. Let's recap the alternate versions, how she knew the details of the costumes and everything else, and how she obtained such personal information about the cafe.

1. Is the coffee you make using a fully automatic machine really that much worse than a semiautomatic one? Such as the delonghi eletta explore vs the sage barista express impress? Im torn between both because Im not sure If ill enjoy the process of making it everyday since i never actually tried a semi automatic before and its a costly investment.
2. Another machine that seems interesting is the ninja cafe luxe but the reviews ive seen praised it for versatility and ease of use but some had issues with dosing problems among other things. From what i understand it makes good coffee across the board but nothing stands out.
3. If the decision is between semi automatics, delonghi or sage? Or something else entirely??
I drink most milk based drinks and a cold brew functionality is a massive bonus for me. If you think automatic is the way to go then what do you think is a good one under ¬£1000 as thats the max budget i have.

Im looking to get the best tasting coffee out of the machine I get but at the same time from what i can tell online is through semi automatic machines. What would you rate the eletta explore vs a semi? In terms of pure coffee taste and getting the most out of the coffee beans!

BUY GAMER SUPPS!

IT'S BETTER THAN COFFEE!

ZERO SUGAR!

BUY IT!



Appearance: He's a metallic humanoid figure with a lean, athletic build. The Gamer Supps logo on his Chest breaks apart the Purple and silver surrounding his lower and upper half respectively. He has no visible facial features, he's less of a person and more of a walking embodiment of the Gamer Supps brand.



Abilities:

Superhuman Strength and Durability: Because He's Metallic, He's Got the Same Strength and Durability as Metal.

Regeneration: when he's Dented or broken, His Dented or Broken Parts start to bend back. but his Regeneration is linked to his blood, the lower his blood is, the slower the regeneration becomes.

Cannot Feel Pain, Which let's him keep going like a relentless animal.

Aggressive Brawler: Fights Aggressively.

Gamer Supps Generation: His Blood is Gamer Supps, and he can also shoot it out as fast as a hose would, he can even bleed Gamer Supps, and when he loses a lot of Gamer Supps, he has to refill by drinking More Gamer Supps.

Backstory: After the Popularity of Pepsi Man Skyrocketed, the Gamer Supps Company Decided to make their own mascot like Pepsi Man, but instead of commercials, he would be Real, which is why they blew half their money on hiring scientists and equipment, and they finally made a whole humanoid Mascot.... but turns out making a whole humanoid made of metal doesn't end well, and Gamer Supps Man went Rogue and Escaped, he's still out there, somewhere.



Other Stuff to Know:

when He sees something new to him or something he Doesn't understand, he gets closer to it and inspects it like an Animal would.

He can Only Eat and Drink Gamer Supps, and when he drinks Gamer Supps when low on blood, also changes his metal to a combination of Titanium and Tungsten and, in turn, Boosts His Stats as the same Material. the transformation is Temporary (for 30 Seconds).",1,1756085216.0,Superhero_Ideas,0,1.0,False

All of the YouTube videos about it, including Lance Hendrick's review, show the steam wand going down too far, making it awkward to use.

My machine came from Chris's Coffee and was a pre-order. Based on their emails, this batch landed in NYC earlier this month, cleared customs, made their way to their shop, and then went straight out to pre-order people.

The steam wand on mine doesn't go down as far, so fitting larger pitchers under it should be no problem.

This machine was technically a downgrade for me, as it's replacing a Quick Mill Andreja Premium. The Andreja is a heat exchanger machine, so it takes 15 minutes at a minimum to warm up. The Pop Up takes 5 minutes, if that. The Pop Up has a PID, so no cooling flushes (I think there's a PID version of the Andreja, but mine has a pressure-stat).

I rarely steam, so losing on-demand steam won't be a problem for me. If I want to steam something, I can handle the ~1 minute wait while it warms up into steam mode.

I'm very happy with my downgrade. I've only pulled one shot with it, but it turned out great. I'm looking forward to playing around with the flow control. I'm most excited about the quick warm up time, though.",4,1756085200.0,espresso,3,0.84,False

1mzdbg0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzdbg0,Help me make my coffee/liquor bar look more elevated,"** Don‚Äôt judge my limited liquor collection. My ex moved out & took most of the good / dark stuff. **

I‚Äôm trying to make this look as elevated as possible while combining liquor & espresso bar. I‚Äôm going to add more framed art so know that is yet to come. But as far as the way the liquor is set up, any recommendations? And what looks better the gold leaf or the checker mat? I could get two checker mats or put the two gold leaf‚Äôs up top. Also in the Venice box are 4 goblet glasses and I have other glassware (two coupe glasses, 2 champagne glasses, and rocks or wine glasses if there is room) and a shaker to add to the mix as well. Where should I put those? The two cubbies on the side are up for available space. The one is just housing that little rocker man and my Bluetooth speaker. They can be moved if need be. 

TLDR: help me style this damn bar please so it looks neat/tidy & an elevated yet eclectic aesthetic ",1,1756084735.0,interiordecorating,5,1.0,False
1mzdb1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mzdb1e/the_spare_room/,The Spare Room,"Four years ago, I was diagnosed with end-stage liver failure. When I was younger, I drank more alcohol than water. I learned that selfishness hurt me more than anyone else ever could. Over time, I slowed down, not because I wanted to, but because partying in your thirties with college kids, as Freddy put it, ‚Äújust isn't a good look‚Äù The yacht parties my dad kept throwing didn‚Äôt help either. Honestly, I wish I had a gambling addiction instead. At least then there was a chance of winning something. All I got was loss of time, health, and any humanity I thought I had left.

My liver was so damaged that there was no chance it could heal on its own. Apparently, my eyes were so yellow it looked like I ‚Äúused pee as eye drops,‚Äù as Freddy joked. I was losing weight rapidly too. I was immensely relieved when I found out my dad had signed me up for Hemacare‚Äôs *Life Vault* package when I was a toddler. All they needed was a blood sample. It‚Äôs supposedly far superior to other organ-printing hospitals, but also significantly more expensive. I guess second chances are only for those who can afford them.

My doctor explained that while traditional transplants always carry a risk of rejection, Hemacare‚Äôs printed organs supposedly have a 100% success rate. They also promise the healthiest possible version of each organ. I called in for a transplant and was scheduled immediately.

When I arrived, a few weeks later, the facility felt more like a luxury hotel than a hospital, aside from the ever-present sterile smell in the stagnate air. The waiting room was quiet and cozy. I waited only a few minutes before a young asian girl entered. She had short black hair and wore high-end designer clothing. She dropped into the chair like she was visiting a friend‚Äôs house. She kept rubbing her left eye, which was covered by a surgical eyepatch. I kept some distance between us in case whatever she had was contagious. Eventually a nurse approached me.

‚ÄúHello, welcome to Hemacare. May I have your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam Jones.‚Äù Of course, this is an alias. Given the nature of this event, sharing my real name would be‚Ä¶ unwise.

‚ÄúAll right, Mr. Jones. You‚Äôre on the *Life Vault* plan. Please follow me so we can get you changed into your hospital gown.‚Äù

The click of her heels echoed through the empty hall with each step, with the awkward silence I couldn't help but admire the polished dark wood floor and the walls painted a warm tan. The sterile scent only grew stronger as we walked. The nurse led me to a small changing room. I swapped my expensive, rumpled suit I'd slept in for a few days, for a surprisingly soft gown. The gown didn't come with slippers, leaving my bare feet to press against the cold floor, each step felt like walking on ice.

When I looked into the mirror it was hard to recognize myself. My eyes were piss yellow, my face and stomach thin. My hair that I‚Äôd kept clean and short was greasy and disheveled. I hardly had the energy to get out of bed most days, forget showering and shaving. I was hopeful that this surgery would give me the motivation I needed to get my life back.

‚ÄúWould you like us to have this cleaned for you?‚Äù, she held it out with both hands as if the suit was radioactive.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. I couldn't blame her. It was filthy, and I‚Äôd been too exhausted to change.

‚ÄúOf course. Please follow me to your room.‚Äù She sealed the suit in a clear garment bag and led the way.

Halfway down the hall, we were stopped at an intersection by two male nurses pulling a cart carrying a large red container about the size of a coffin. The shorter of the two men paused for a moment to look at his clipboard. As he scanned the page, a soft thud came from the container. He looked fearfully at the other nurse, who swiftly grabbed the handle of the cart and pulled it down the hallway, walking as fast as he could without running. The shorter nurse scrambled to follow him, throwing a nervous glance at me.¬†

I gazed down the hall they had come from and noticed a door labeled *Spare Room*. It was the only one with a badge scanner. I could see a red light glowing from under the door. Curiosity tugged at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in there?‚Äù I asked.¬†

The nurse looked briefly toward the door, clearly shaken by what just transpired. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she laughed nervously, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the spare room. We store emergency equipment and replacement supplies there. Now, please follow me, we've almost reached your room.‚Äù¬†

As we walked, I couldn't stop thinking about that room. I glanced back, the red light was gone, but my interest wasn't.

When we reached my room, I noticed it had the same ID scanner as the spare room door from earlier. The nurse swiped the card hanging from her neck, and the door clicked open. When I entered the room, I was genuinely surprised. I‚Äôve stayed in hotel rooms far less luxurious than this. The bed was all white, the room dimly lit and stylishly modern. Gray leather couches, a dark marble coffee table, a door to my own restroom, a huge flat-screen TV, and even a sleek mini-fridge humming quietly in the corner.

‚ÄúThis is where you‚Äôll stay while you‚Äôre being treated. The duration depends on how your body responds. You‚Äôre free to leave the building, but we *strongly* recommend you don‚Äôt, especially before and after the surgery. Please make yourself at home. I‚Äôll go call your surgeon.‚Äù

Naturally, I checked the fridge first. It was stocked with soft foods; applesauce, pudding, protein shakes, and an assortment of jelly. I took a cherry jelly cup and a plastic spoon, sat on the couch, and took my first bite of real food in days. You know you're at rock bottom when jelly is the most nutritious thing you've eaten in a week.

The translucent jelly glowed an unnatural red under the warmth of the overhead light . It brought back the memory of the light seeping from beneath the spare room door. I decided to go take a look around the hospital but when I made my way over to the door and turned the handle, it didn't budge, it was locked.

A short while later, a man in a white coat knocked and entered, leaving the door open.

‚ÄúGood evening, Mr. Jones. I'm Dr. Mathew Ross, and I‚Äôll be performing your surgery. But first I need to explain your situation. Your body shows clear signs of Decompensated cirrhosis, but luckily there‚Äôs still plenty of time to prepare. Your new liver will be ready soon. Until then, please do not eat anything for the next eight hours to avoid complications. Your surgery is scheduled for 10:00 PM. Also, please don‚Äôt leave the room. We‚Äôll need to be able to reach you in case of an emergency. Do you have any questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Why is my door locked?‚Äù

Dr. Ross pulled a keycard from his coat pocket. ‚ÄúThis is my access card, it gives staff access to any door within their clearance level. We keep certain doors locked to prevent patients from wandering while undergoing treatment. Surgery can be stressful, and sometimes patients get disoriented and start walking around. Our building is huge, full of winding halls and identical rooms. If someone has a medical emergency and they're not in the right room, we might not be able to reach them in time. Of course, you‚Äôre free to use the restroom that is attached to your room, and you can leave the facility at any time. Just let us know so someone can escort you safely. Any other questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that makes sense. Actually, I do have another one‚Ä¶ Where exactly does the liver come from? And why is it supposed to be better than the organs from other hospitals?‚Äù I didn't actually care for the answers, I just needed a distraction.

‚ÄúThe liver is actually grown from your own blood. When you were a child, your parents enrolled you in our plan. Unlike most hospitals that freeze blood and grow organs only when needed in a womb-like environment, we grow all vital organs immediately after receiving the sample. Maintaining them is extremely expensive, but there are benefits: your body accepts the organ as if it‚Äôs always been there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by accepting? Does the body try to refuse organs?‚Äô I asked while slowly walking over to the empty jelly cup.

The doctor paused, ‚ÄúYes, traditional organ transplant rejections are fairly common. The immune system doesn't recognize the organ and attacks it. Ours don‚Äôt have that risk, which is what sets us apart from other organ printing companies.

‚ÄúBut if they can freeze blood why don't you guys just freeze organs too? That way you can thaw them when needed‚Äù, I took the jelly cup‚Äôs aluminum seal off the table.

The surgeon smiled and said, ‚ÄúThat is a great idea, blood cells frozen for many years could lead to DNA damage, so other companies run that risk. To reduce this risk, they split the blood into multiple vials since it doesn't take much blood to start the organ growing process. However, organs are much larger, and a lot more complex. Freezing and thawing will almost always result in the organ being damaged severely. Preserving it in a false body apparatus keeps the organ growing and healthy without the need of freezing.‚Äù

I was still a bit confused but I think I got the gist ‚ÄúYeah, Yeah I guess that makes sense, one last thing if you don't mind, while i was in the bathroom the faucet wasn't working, could you please take a look at it‚Äù

The doctor hesitated. ‚ÄúUh, sure‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not exactly handy. If there‚Äôs a problem, I‚Äôll call for assistance.‚Äù He set his clipboard on the table and walked into the restroom. The moment he left my view, I moved quickly and quietly to the door, stuffing the aluminum cover into the slot where the door lock would go into. ‚ÄúIt seems to be working fine‚Äù I quickly went back to where I was standing, Dr Ross's voice becoming louder as he left the bathroom ‚Äúif you have any more issues with the faucet, just press on the remote near your bedside and a nurse will be with you right away‚Äù



‚ÄúThank you so much, I really appreciate your help Dr Ross‚Äù I tried for a polite smile but it came off as condescending. His own smile faltered a bit ‚ÄúYou're very welcome, I‚Äôm glad I could help. I‚Äôll get everything ready for the procedure. Please, enjoy your stay.‚Äù

He left, and I was alone again.

Bored of endless scrolling through streaming services, I sat in silence, waiting for the coast to clear. Eventually, I decided it was safe to leave. I had to know what the source of that red light was, and what made that noise from inside the container.¬†

I got up and turned the door handle slowly, careful to not make noise. The hallways were just as empty as before, but without the nurse's rhythmic steps. I wandered through the repeating hallways, the only indication that I wasn't going in circles were the room number signs. While I was walking around trying to find the red room, a nurse walking backwards with an empty cart bumped into me. They were the nurses from before, I instantly noticed his ID card clipped onto his pants pocket, I could barely make out the name ‚ÄòReginald‚Äô.

¬†‚ÄúOh! I‚Äôm so sorry...‚Äù He paused, his eyes fixed on my face, like he couldn‚Äôt quite understand what he was seeing.

It felt like he was scanning every inch of me. The taller nurse gave him a sharp nudge with the cart and let out a cough. The short nurse blinked in succession, then forced a smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, sir. Please return to your room and wait for your treatment.‚Äù

I know I‚Äôm not much to look at. I'm stricken with jaundice, skinny and sick, but you‚Äôd think a nurse would be used to it. The short nurse whispered something to the tall one, who nodded and took the cart while the other walked off in the direction they‚Äôd come from.

Curious, I followed him, keeping my distance. He kept glancing over his shoulder, failing at being inconspicuous. He picked up his pace. After a final turn, he reached the *Spare Room*, pulled out a keycard, scanned it, then entered a code into the keypad. He slipped inside.

Going in with him would be risky, so I thought if I hid and waited I could try to steal his badge discreetly. So I hid behind a corner watching the door and waiting. Only a few moments later the red light returned and immediately after the nurse walked out, sighing a breath of relief, but quickly looked up. A jolt of panic hit me‚Äîhad he seen me? I desperately looked for a hiding place so I crouched behind a large plant in an alcove. I was surprised that I was small enough to fit.¬†

His footsteps were quick, they drew closer, growing louder until they suddenly slowed. I held my breath, praying he didn't notice me. His footsteps stopped entirely, but after a¬† few moments he muttered ‚Äòget it together, man‚Äô. Then his footsteps continued, completely unaware that I was there. I knew that if I was¬† found, they'd tighten up security. Then I'd have no chance of knowing what was in that room. And I'd be mortified that I'd been found crouching half naked behind a plant like a lunatic.¬†

After a minute of silence, I sprinted to the door. Miraculously, the nurse left his card in the scanner, I looked over my shoulder to make sure no one was around, and reached for the door handle, but the closer my hand got to the metal handle, the colder the air around my fingers became, I hesitated for a moment, doubts crawling down my body like spiders, but curiosity pushed through, and I gently open the door.¬†

The room was very dark and freezing, each breath let out visible fog. It was mostly empty except for a blue-lit screen glowing softly on a podium in the center. Above me, rows upon rows of large glass chambers hung like meat hooks in a butcher shop.

I approached the screen. It asked for a patient's name or ID. I entered my name.

**Result found.**

I selected my profile. **Name:** Adam Jones **Age:** 35 **Sex:** Male

more data such as blood type, medical history, etc were listed. On the right side of the screen was a large green button: **SPARE**. I immediately pressed it.

A second profile appeared: **Spare ‚Äì 7370617265** **Age:** 33 **Organs Available:** All green-listed, except one: **Liver ‚Äì Unavailable**.

I felt something churn deep inside

Then I saw another button: **Retrieve**\-in bright yellow.

And I, of course, pressed it.

The glass chambers overhead started moving on tracks, clanking and shifting until one hovered above the center platform. Beneath it, a circular platform lit up white the chamber slowly descended, like a claw-machine lowering a fragile prize.

When the glass chambers stopped, I looked closely into it. A pair of white eyes stared back at me.

I froze. Terror became a dark oozing liquid, clinging to me. The figure had long brown hair, and wore a breathing mask with a tube covering most of his face. Wires coiled around his muscular frame suspended in fluid, curled in a fetal position.

Its gaze followed me no matter where I moved. Not alert, just instinctive. Infantile.

Whoever this was, I had to help him.

I pounded on the glass. Nothing. It was stronger than I expected. There had to be a way to open it.

‚ÄúHey, can you understand me?‚Äù I asked the man desperately, but he stayed silent. I stared at him hoping that he would show some sort of awareness, but the longer I looked the more familiar he became.

The hair color, the eyes, the face shape. I noticed two small moles on the man's curled hands. I quickly turned my wrist to look for my own two moles. For a moment I could not even fathom it. It was me.

I jerked my head back to the terminal. The yellow button was now red: **Drain and Extract**.

Before I could press it, I heard voices approaching. I ducked into a shadowed corner.

The two nurses stormed in, wheeling in the cart along with them, with the large red container from before.

‚ÄúYou idiot! How do you forget to pull your ID from the scanner?‚Äù the tall one hissed.

‚ÄúI know, I know! But it was that guy‚Äôs fault‚Ä¶ he got into my head, when I left the room I swear I thought I saw him again at the end of the hallway so quickly I ran to catch him but no one was there-‚Äù

The two froze when their eyes locked onto the tank.

‚ÄúYou forgot to PUT BACK THE SPARE?‚Äù

‚ÄúI *did*! I swear! Th-there must‚Äôve been ah-a glitch or something!‚Äù I couldn't tell if he was stuttering from the cold or from anxiety.

The tall nurse crossed his arms and took a deep breath, ‚ÄúYou forgot your keycard and blamed it on a hallucination, then you didn't return the spare, and you expect me to believe there was a glitch?‚Äù, he finished, nearly shouting.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶¬† I know how this looks, but please don‚Äôt tell K-Karla. She‚Äôll kill me. I swear this won‚Äôt happen again!‚Äù, he said pleadingly.

The tall one's anger dissipated, melting into sympathy. ‚ÄúFine. The system automatically tells her when spares are retrieved but not by whom, I‚Äôll say I retrieved the spare three times, I'll make up a dumb reason. But *you* tell her about bumping into the patient and the keycard.‚Äù

The short nurse nodded rapidly, eyes full of tears. The tall man pressed a button, returning the man in the chamber to its place.

The tall man sighed ‚Äúalright, which one is next‚Äù, he said, his breath turning to fog in the freezing room.

The shorter nurse wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and pulled out a clipboard from the cart

The short nurse cleared his throat ‚Äúuhh, Tammy Warren, ID number is 6579650d0a, female, 24, severe eye damage‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother one? There have been so many eye replacements recently, is there disease or something to worry about?‚Äù the tall man spoke as he typed on the screen, ‚ÄúIt looks like one eye is already unavailable, is the patient sick?‚Äù

The capsules moved again, ‚ÄúNo, I looked into it, almost 90% of the eyes we remove from patients have the same strange residue on them. It's caused by this new hallucinogenic on the market, ‚Äòeye candy‚Äô. Apparently, because new organs are more accessible than ever, people have started experimenting with it. It causes extremely vivid hallucinations but almost always destroys the eyes. The worst part is, the people who get a transplant after wrecking their vision almost always relapse. But unlike necessary organs, eyes don't need to be put into the spares to acclimate.""¬†

He finished speaking when a new capsule lowered. It contained a young asian girl, her hair black and shiny, swirling around her like a cocoon. The taller man shook his head, ‚ÄúThose damn junkies, you'd think having a second chance would stop them from self destruction, what if something happened to the meat fridges, has the thought never crossed their minds? They're taking their organs for granted.‚Äù he spat.

After a few moments of silent scribbling on the clipboard the taller nurse spoke again, ‚ÄúAlright get the cart ready, I'll drain and extract.‚Äù He tapped on the screen again, this time the whole room lit up deep red, like a photographer's dark room.

My stomach dropped. *They'll see me.*

The chamber drained of liquid, the girl descended slowly until her frail naked body met the floor. She laid there, motionless, as the chamber glass slid to the side, granting access to their ‚Äòmeat fridge‚Äô. The short nurse gave a button at the side of the cart a long press, lowering it until the top reached his ankle.

¬†‚ÄúAright,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike usual, I'll get the hands and you get the legs,‚Äù the taller man ordered. The shorter man stretched his back and bent down to pick up the girl‚Äôs legs and dropped them, ‚ÄúDamn.. sorry, She's slippery.‚Äù The taller man took a deep, steadying breath and patiently held onto her arms, used to his partner's incompetence. The shorter nurse grabbed a towel from the cart and wiped her legs dry. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù, he muttered again. The two men slowly picked her up and placed her gently into the red container.

There wasn‚Äôt even the faintest trace of resistance in the girl, she was more corpse than human. Just looking at her turned my stomach. I had to get out of there, and fast.¬†

The tall man walked back over to the computer and pressed the screen again. ""Alright, which room?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoom 411‚Äù, the short nurse said, as the empty chamber ascended back into the rafters. The two nurses left, pulling the cart behind them.

The silence in the room was palpable. I rushed over to the screen and pulled up my clone‚Äôs profile one last time. My index finger quickly moved to the right side, but I hovered there, shaking, above the **Retrieve** button.

¬†They‚Äôd know it was retrieved a 4th time. Why risk it? What if I needed another organ like Tammy?

Yeah, I know how bad that sounds. I mean, I could get another organ grown, but what if it's my heart and they couldn't grow it fast enough, or what if my body rejects it?

I slowly looked up at the capsules, listening for even the slightest murmur for help, but the room was a silent graveyard. I could see faint eyes watching me from all around. A few had one eye. Even fewer had both.

These weren‚Äôt real people, I told myself. They were *storage*. If I opened the capsules, they‚Äôd probably just collapse helplessly too.

I held my hand reluctantly over the ‚Äòx‚Äô icon and closed my eyes‚Ä¶ and pressed down.

Maybe someone else will help them. Walking out of that room, I‚Äôd convinced myself I couldn‚Äôt, that I wouldn't even know how. Now, 4 years later, I know that that was bullshit. I even knew it then, but I still walked away. I‚Äôm hoping that by writing this, and telling the world, that someone will see this and do what I couldn't. I couldn't help then, and I can‚Äôt help now. I can‚Äôt go back. I can‚Äôt face those lifeless eyes that I left behind. I still remember those eyes as I reach for another bottle.

1mzd9gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictoChill/comments/1mzd9gh/a_jampacked_birthday/,A Jam-Packed Birthday!,"I'm a little late to make this post, but I had a lot going on, so it's better late than never!

Last Thursday(August 21st) was my 19th birthday! I was going to a Coffee House in my hometown that wasn't the one from my old school, but that didn't happen because my irl friend was sick and my sister didn't feel like dropping me off there on my own. However, my f/os made up for it with a fun birthday! First, I had a birthday breakfast with my fictional friends from Meta Runner. The others finished up, and then it was just me and Masa. That was when Masa's love confession happened. I was so full of joy that I wrapped my arms around him almost immediately. He also mentioned that there were more surprises to come later. I didn't know what he meant, but I didn't really care at the moment. The others did think that it was about time me and Masa became a thing. Sometime later, he revealed that the next surprise was on Pasio. When I teleported over there, that surprise came in the form of Lysandre(from Pokemon). Right before I left, Sofia(from Meta Runner) had me switch into a new outfit. It was similar to Serena's Sygna Suit with Zygarde, but with some alterations. The white was swapped out with purple, the green was swapped out with red, and I still had my tennis shoes. When Lysandre and I finally met up on Pasio, he asked if I liked my birthday gift from him. I sure did! We had our lunch together at a cafe. Later, as we were out in the mountain area of the island, I told him about how college classes are coming up and how I'm worried that if I'm not around as much, we might lose touch. However, he reassured me that it's kinda like me traveling across the different Pokemon regions, and in a way, he's kinda right. In recent years, traveling to a new region or a new fictional dimension is both exciting and kinda nerve-racking because...you never know what's going to happen. However, when you meet the right people, it makes it all worth it. Lysandre added on that not only will we continue to be partners through Pokemon, but partners in life. That's when the kiss finally happened. A few hours later, everyone surprised me with an awesome birthday bash! During that, I stepped outside towards the balcony to get some fresh air and admire the beautiful night sky. Masa and Lysandre soon joined me, along with who they explained was the third surprise: Sebastian from Stardew Valley. I was confused, but was flustered again when I essentially got hit with his love confession. Honestly, I was going to tell him, but he beat me to it, and I have nothing wrong with it! I asked why they all decided to confess on the same day, and they explained that they, alongside the rest of my romantic f/os, wanted to be with me as I ease into college. It really warmed my heart. 

I think that's enough for this post because I've been at this for hours. To end things off, I wanted to thank you all for sticking with us through everything. I don't want to leave what we have, and I hope we can continue together in the future. I will try to continue Part 4 of my current story and add a teaser for a potential new one. That's all for now!

Last Thursday(August 21st) was my 19th birthday! I was going to a Coffee House in my hometown that wasn't the one from my old school, but that didn't happen because my irl friend was sick and my sister didn't feel like dropping me off there on my own. However, my f/os made up for it with a fun birthday! First, I had a birthday breakfast with my fictional friends from Meta Runner. The others finished up, and then it was just me and Masa. That was when Masa's love confession happened. I was so full of joy that I wrapped my arms around him almost immediately. He also mentioned that there were more surprises to come later. I didn't know what he meant, but I didn't really care at the moment. The others did think that it was about time me and Masa became a thing. Sometime later, he revealed that the next surprise was on Pasio. When I teleported over there, that surprise came in the form of Lysandre(from Pokemon). Right before I left, Sofia(from Meta Runner) had me switch into a new outfit. It was similar to Serena's Sygna Suit with Zygarde, but with some alterations. The white was swapped out with purple, the green was swapped out with red, and I still had my tennis shoes. When Lysandre and I finally met up on Pasio, he asked if I liked my birthday gift from him. I sure did! We had our lunch together at a cafe. Later, as we were out in the mountain area of the island, I told him about how college classes are coming up and how I'm worried that if I'm not around as much, we might lose touch. However, he reassured me that it's kinda like me traveling across the different Pokemon regions, and in a way, he's kinda right. In recent years, traveling to a new region or a new fictional dimension is both exciting and kinda nerve-racking because...you never know what's going to happen. However, when you meet the right people, it makes it all worth it. Lysandre added on that not only will we continue to be partners through Pokemon, but partners in life. That's when the kiss finally happened. A few hours later, everyone surprised me with an awesome birthday bash! During that, I stepped outside towards the balcony to get some fresh air and admire the beautiful night sky. Masa and Lysandre soon joined me, along with who they explained was the third surprise: Sebastian from Stardew Valley.

Fast-forward to today, and our latest build feels like an actual *memory-recovering caf√©* you‚Äôd want to hang out in!

We put together a quick shorts video comparing:

* **Prototype Version:** rough, blocky, and ‚Äúcoffee is suspiciously pixel soup‚Äù
* **Current Dev Build:** cozy interior, detailed customers, and the vibe finally

It‚Äôs been a wild ride, and honestly, seeing the before/after makes us laugh every time. Hope you enjoy the glow-up as much as we do!

Game: *HIPS N‚Äô NOSES* ‚Äì a caf√© management √ó action roguelike where you restore lost memories by day and fight nightmares by night.  
Still in development, but we love sharing these progress peeks!",1,1756084384.0,indiegames,2,1.0,False

Just last week I went for a coffee at my local mall only to see my ex‚Äôs car in the parking lot. My body went into fight or flight mode and I could feel the adrenaline rush through my body. An overwhelming wave of memories came to me after seeing her car about all the adventures we shared. I couldn‚Äôt turn back so I attempted to ""shop"" before getting my coffee which was less shop and more trying to regulate my heart rate. When I finally calmed down enough I could see her sitting down on her laptop and I felt like my gut was punched by Hercules or Thor. My hands were quivering as I held my phone so I had to put it away and cross my arms to keep myself collected. My back was mostly turned to her and I was trying my very best to be calm but if she were to see me, my neck would betray me bc I could literally feel and see my heart pulse in my neck. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since. I still love her but I know that our dynamic isn‚Äôt ideal and that I will always struggle trusting her. ",3,1756084315.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
