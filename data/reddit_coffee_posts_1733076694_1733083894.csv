Long story short, I got played by a group of girls who pretended to be my friends for 10 years or less. All in all they tried to isolate me from the community by telling me lies about everyone but they also didn’t want to be my friends. Here are a few examples of what they did: 
Tharshika would tell me that half the high school and university we went to was using marijuana at a time when it was illegal. In high school the story was that all these guys were in gangs and doing drugs and getting chased by the police. Even some of the girls had started experimenting with marijuana. When we got to uni it was worse. She knew the story of everyone and she made sure to fill me in.  I did beg for her and the others to stop shit talking but they would not stop. I asked them to use nicknames instead of the real names because no one deserves to hear ppl talk shit about them. And I couldn’t stop them from doing it. 

Once when her boyfriend was driving her and I home, he parked the car at a food spot and I asked tharshika what he was doing and she said « he’s doing a drug deal ». So I was like why is he doing that us in the car. She never answered. 
That was a reoccurring thing. When I asked a question no one would really answer or they would give me a stupid answer. 
They would ask for my notes and make me watch their stuff and hold tables for them. That’s what I was needed for. 
In grade 7 thomena would always turn to me and ask me for my notes as I was writing them down during the teachers lesson. I’d always finish taking notes and give them to her and let her copy them. Same thing happened before our Chem exam in high school. She borrowed my binder of notes. Fast forward to uni, I had missed a note on the slide and I turned to her to ask her if she could give me that note and she covered her page with her hand and said « you should have paid attention »
They would borrow keerthana’s and my buss pass to get home. One day they lost it. They didn’t even offer to pay for it. 
This would happen all the time when I let tharshika borrow my jewelry or anything else. She’d bring it back damaged and I was expected to replace it. 
Thomena would ask me to pick up her lunch from her house and bring it to her if I was making my way to campus later in the morning. Sometimes i’d forget. One time her lunch wasn’t ready and I had to wait for her mom to finish making lunch so i could take it to her. I ended up skipping class that day because I waited for her lunch to be made. 
Thomena, tharshika, and I we’re all in the same program. Eventually they had switched out of the classes we planned to take together. I thought it was a mistake. 
I was always the last person to know what was happening in the group. Thomena had told me many to times not to celebrate my birthday. I found that odd. I never questioned why she would say that. 
Thomena invited me to her house to apply for university and when I had gone over, we were in the middle of applying and thomena and tharshika picked up their laptops and moved away from me. Keerthana was asking me to come sit beside her so we could apply together. I rmbr not understanding what was going on. I don’t understand why someone would sound so caring to invite me over to their house but then leave me stranded. This was a reoccurring thing. We joined a dance competition and tharshika had been the one to ask me if I wanted to tryout with them. We all got chosen to join the dance group and we went to practice together. On performance day, we were all in our costumes and they had asked me to take pictures of them. Once I had finished taking their pics, they got their phone back and walked out the room. I didn’t get to take pics in my costumes not with them and they didn’t care. When we went to the mall to shop, I found a pair of jeans that I really wanted to try on and as I was about to tell them I wanted to try it on they both walked out the store. I was In a hurry to catch up with them so I accidentally took the pair of jeans out the store and the alarm went off.  so I quickly ran back and threw the jeans in the store and caught up with them. I just don’t understand if they were friends why they would keep calling me to join them. I mean I guess I know now I was the victim they enjoyed bullying.
As a group we would pitch in to buy the birthday girl a present and this time the birthday girl was thomena. So me and tharshika thought we’d go shopping together to grab her a present and the whole time we were there she was on the phone with her boyfriend. Not once did she say hey I’m doing something with my friend for another friend so I will get back to you when I can. Both of them would keep showing up to the doorway of my classroom in high school and they would wave and try mouthing something to me. In particular when tharshika forgot her running shoes, she and thomena would show up to my classroom in high school and ask the teacher if they could speak to me. I would step out and tharshika would ask me to trade my shoes for her flats. I would do it. Later, if I asked to borrow her hair tie she would say no and no was her final answer. Thomena tharshika and keerthana would all share my lunch when they didn’t bring there’s and keerthana would eat my pizza but continue to say it doesn’t taste good. When I worked at Tim Hortons, they  would always ask for iced coffee and then once I gave it to them free of charge, they would say it never tasted good at the location I worked at. But they would still ask for more. Tharshika had told me her boyfriend was autistic and how he was hitting on her and she would say it in a way that sounded like a complaint and she would say that she didn’t  like him cuz he’s autistic. Later he would become her boyfriend and I found out that the guy hitting on her wasn’t autistic but he had a autistic brother. There were so many double standards with them. Everything I did was judged and I was painted to be the bad guy but I gave them nothing but respect and support. Keerthana and thomena started talking shit about tharshika’s boyfriend and I was the only one that said « hey it’s her choice and if anything goes wrong we will support her. » keerthana had become my best friend eventually when thomena and tharshika had decided to go off on their own. We’d pass by them in the gym as they were heading out and we were coming in, they would laugh like they didn’t even know us. Keerthana had asked me for my password to the student locker account. I said many times I didn’t want to give it to her and she kept asking. So I caved and I gave her my password. Eventually keerthana had ghosted me and started hanging out with the everyone else as if I didn’t know those ppl either. And when I found out someone had hacked my fb I blamed it on keerthana and dhanuja and shanoo cuz all of a sudden they became besties and started hanging out and I found that weird cuz we all knew each other. However, keerthana pretended as if I didn’t know them and they pretended as if we weren’t a part of the same social circle. And keerthana had one of my passwords which meant she had all of my passwords cuz all my passwords were the same. Thomena had asked me for my password. And so did tharshika. But I had told them if I give it to you and some thing goes wrong the blame is gonna fall on you because I don’t share my password with anyone . At that time you couldn’t even delete fb accounts. As I said I blamed shanoo, dhanuja and keerthana. Before I did that tho, I told all of them together (in person) that someone had hacked my fb. And no one cared enough to help me figure it out or ask if I was ok. Thomena and tharshika had invited me to go to soki’s house for her birthday and she told me not to tell keerthana about it. And I still had my fb issue on my mind. Again I tried opening up about it and no one seemed to care. The three of them were giving each other piggy back rides.  I had a panick attack twice around thomena and tharshika. Once the day before the exam and one on the day of the exam. On the day of the exam, I told them I couldn’t breathe and my heart was racing really fast. Thatshika had turned around and said do you need help. I felt bad cuz they had a exam so I said it’s fine you study for your exam. And then we wrote the exam and I came out. We were all sitting on a bench. They were discussing the exam questions and the panic attack got worse. I kept asking them for help. But they wouldn’t turn around. I got desperate for help and I thought if I talk to them about the exam questions I could get their attention and they still wouldn’t turn around. They got up  and left to walk towards the bus and I tried so hard to keep up cuz there was nooen else around and I couldn’t breathe. Eventually the whole group had cut me off, gaslighted the fuck out of me, and said things like we are protecting our feelings and mental health or we don’t want to engage with this topic anymore. Even when I was working, if a coworker had spoke to me. As soon as the conversation was over, I would turn back to face them and thomena would say « if you talk to her watch what happens ». But she was allowed to make friends at her workplace and introduce them to our group of friends.
 This is the same person that tried to slap me because I said hey to her. It’s funny tho because the same person they didn’t want anything to do with, soki and keerthana went to go meet up with during the time that my mental health had severely depleted. But they could never make an effort to check up on the person ( me ) who was there all these years for them. They didn’t even bother celebrating my birthday after my 21st. No one showed up to my house , in fact they thought it was okay to argue with me at my lowest point. I started calling them out on their behaviour. I even gave them a chance to speak about anything I have done to hurt them and none of them said anything. They all said they had nothing to say. I even told each of them the crap they said to me about each other. Apparently after they would meet up and talk things through. But again. I was left out of that discussion because I was deemed to be the problem.  Dhanuja  and shanoo would ignore my messages when I wished them for their birthdays and invited them to go out. The rest of the group just stopped inviting me to things. And tharshika would say sorry but she wouldn’t do anything to change her character to make me feel more comfortable. It was more like I’m sorry but this friendship is over.  Or a way of saying something to shit me up. What I found the most disturbing was that this was a group of Tamil girls hating on a Tamil girl. Unfortunately there are no good laws protecting victims of this kind of bullying. In the end, toxic people like them get away with this crap so I’m leaving this here to help others identify red flags in their relstionships.

1h4c53z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h4c53z,July 2024 Tuscany Wedding,"We hosted 56 people (including ourselves) in Tuscany over three days. Our wedding venue fees included exclusive use of the property for 7 days. 

I don't consider myself a big budget bride. The vibe for our event was more casual countryside wedding than luxury. However, I did rely on this sub so much while I was planning. I am so grateful to everyone here for their support and encouragement! The Italian vendors were very affordable, at times shockingly so. We got so much more for our money in Tuscany than we ever could have in NYC, New England, or the Hudson Valley where we began our search for a venue.

We paid for guest transportation, accommodations, food and drink, and entertainment for the three days. Given our guests had to travel at significant expense, it was important for us to really take care of them upon arrival. We hosted a welcome wine tour, a welcome pizza party, a wedding day brunch, the wedding ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and dance party, a post-wedding day brunch, a post-wedding day 1960's style-pool party BBQ, and a coffee and pastry send off on the last day. We also stocked our guests' accommodations with simple groceries and beverages in case they needed anything between formal events. 

The budget below does not include attire, rings, flights, gifts, and ancillary travel / events before and after the wedding. I included vendors we used in the budget. I really loved and highly recommend our wedding planner Lovely Tuscany (Laura), our caterer Il Sorriso, our florist I Fiori di Nadia, The Alpinos, Miss 500 / Brace Divina, and all of our musicians. We haven't received our wedding video, yet, but MB Heart Films was a joy to work with. We had some hiccups with Magnolia Photography and Thistle Paper Co., so I recommend them with a small caveat, though their finished products were mostly great.

Looking for a water bottle that keeps your drinks at the perfect temperature while also standing up to the rigors of daily life? Enter the **Stanley Thermal Cup**, a product that’s taken both Amazon and Reddit by storm. Here’s my in-depth, personal take on why this cup has earned its spot as a trending must-have in 2024.

# Why I Needed a Stanley Thermal Cup

As someone constantly on the go—balancing work, fitness, and weekend outdoor trips—I needed something better than the cheap plastic water bottles that couldn’t keep my coffee hot or my iced tea cold. After seeing endless Reddit threads and TikTok videos raving about the Stanley cup, I caved in. Spoiler alert: I haven’t looked back since!

# A Closer Look at the Stanley Thermal Cup

# 1. Unmatched Insulation

Stanley boasts *double-wall vacuum insulation*, and they’re not kidding. My morning coffee stays hot for 12+ hours, while my iced water remains refreshingly cold for over 24 hours. It’s ideal whether I’m braving cold hikes or enduring long work meetings.

>

# 2. Built for Life

This cup is made from **stainless steel** with a rugged design. I’ve dropped it more times than I’d like to admit, but it shows zero dents or leaks. Whether you’re an adventurer or just a clumsy commuter, the Stanley cup will keep up with you.

# 3. Sustainability Wins

With the world moving toward **eco-friendly alternatives**, Stanley cups are a great choice for ditching single-use plastic bottles. Plus, the durable build means you’re buying something that’ll last years—not weeks.

# 4. Stylish & Functional Design

The classic design isn’t just functional but also Instagram-worthy. The ergonomic handle and spill-proof lid are practical for daily use, but the modern color options make it a fashion statement.

# My Experience After Months of Use

# Everyday Use

I take my Stanley cup everywhere—work, the gym, long road trips, and even camping. The lid is spill-proof, so it’s stress-free even when tossed into my backpack.

# Performance

Even on a blazing hot day, my iced lemonade stayed frosty from morning until evening. For coffee lovers, this cup preserves flavor without the metallic aftertaste some cheaper alternatives have.

# Durability Test

After a few accidental drops on concrete, I can confidently say this thing is *tough*. No dents, no leaks—just good as new.

# Why It’s a Reddit Favorite

Browsing through Reddit threads like r/BuyItForLife and r/Frugal, it’s clear why the Stanley Thermal Cup is a community favorite:

* **Durability**: Long-lasting products that save money in the long run.
* **Eco-Friendliness**: Aligns with the growing sustainability trend.
* **Aesthetic Appeal**: Stylish and functional for everyday use.
* **Hype-Validated**: It lives up to its social media reputation.

# Honest Pros & Cons

# What I Love

* Exceptional temperature retention (hot and cold).
* Eco-friendly alternative to plastic bottles.
* Built to last—zero dents or cracks after months of rough use.
* Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.
* Stylish design options for every personality.

# Room for Improvement

* **Bulky**: Doesn’t fit standard car cup holders.
* **Premium Pricing**: Around $40–$50 may feel steep, but the quality makes it worth the splurge.

# Who Should Buy the Stanley Thermal Cup?

* **Commuters**: Keep your coffee hot for your entire commute.
* **Outdoor Enthusiasts**: Perfect for camping, hiking, or road trips.
* **Eco-Conscious Shoppers**: Reduce single-use waste with this sustainable option.
* **Anyone Who Values Durability**: This cup can handle drops, bumps, and the chaos of everyday life.

# Stanley vs. Competitors

Compared to other insulated bottles like Yeti or Hydro Flask, Stanley offers **better durability at a similar price point**. While Yeti leans toward premium branding, Stanley provides rugged utility with an equally stylish edge.

# Final Verdict

If you’re tired of settling for lukewarm coffee or watered-down iced drinks, the **Stanley Thermal Cup** is a worthy upgrade. Its durability, temperature retention, and eco-friendly design make it a standout choice for anyone, from coffee addicts to outdoor enthusiasts.

Trust me—you won’t regret adding this powerhouse to your daily routine.

1h4c3jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1h4c3jh/first_time_recovering_from_a_super_intense_split/,First time recovering from a super intense split,"My husband and I are open and practicing an ENM lifestyle, something that I often feel directly conflicts with my BPD diagnosis. We have an amazing relationship and I love it and him so much, but it comes with SO many pitfalls. The amount of energy I have put into myself and the work we've done on our relationship to make it work has been extreme, but very rewarding.

He had started texting with a new girl and they were vibing well he'd told me, and instead of the usual sense of compersion I normally get I was immediately flooded with seething white hot rage. Jealousy and insecurity completely overwhelmed my safeguards, probably because I was on my period and otherwise just mentally fatigued so being able to combat the intrusive thoughts was overwhelmingly impossible. I wanted her dead, I wanted to see her smeared across asphalt by a semi so badly I could practically feel her blood on my hands. It was so completely over the top.

I eventually calmed down after a hysterical choke-sobbing cold shower in the fetal position, meeting with my therapist, talking to my husband, eating some chocolate, and doing a bit of digging by checking the facts, self-reflecting and working through some emotional regulation sheets to identify the source of the emotions and the issues I had with her. My husband had told me he'd stop corresponding with her, but I didn't want that for him. He was genuinely enjoying her company, and she his, and I wasn't going to take that away because I can't keep my emotions in check.

I pushed him to set up a meeting, between the three of us, so he did. I just got back from our lil coffee date and it went so well! She's great, really great, and we all got along so well we're talking about doing another longer date again soon. This is the most surreal feeling, I have never ever been able to recover someone from my ""black box"" after I've put them there during a splitting episode. Younger me would have pretended I was fine with meeting her only to get her and I in the same place only for me to completely lose my shit on her, probably have the police get involved and shit. Wasn't a cute look for me. 

I am so glad for this evidence of growth, and I truly hope this is the start of a new way of coping with one of the worst and most annoying BPD symptoms I have struggled with.",1,1733083475.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Long story short, I got played by a group of girls who pretended to be my friends for 10 years or less. All in all they tried to isolate me from the community by telling me lies about everyone but they also didn’t want to be my friends. Here are a few examples of what they did: 
Tharshika would tell me that half the high school and university we went to was using marijuana at a time when it was illegal. In high school the story was that all these guys were in gangs and doing drugs and getting chased by the police. Even some of the girls had started experimenting with marijuana. When we got to uni it was worse. She knew the story of everyone and she made sure to fill me in.  I did beg for her and the others to stop shit talking but they would not stop. I asked them to use nicknames instead of the real names because no one deserves to hear ppl talk shit about them. And I couldn’t stop them from doing it. 

Once when her boyfriend was driving her and I home, he parked the car at a food spot and I asked tharshika what he was doing and she said « he’s doing a drug deal ». So I was like why is he doing that us in the car. She never answered. 
That was a reoccurring thing. When I asked a question no one would really answer or they would give me a stupid answer. 
They would ask for my notes and make me watch their stuff and hold tables for them. That’s what I was needed for. 
In grade 7 thomena would always turn to me and ask me for my notes as I was writing them down during the teachers lesson. I’d always finish taking notes and give them to her and let her copy them. Same thing happened before our Chem exam in high school. She borrowed my binder of notes. Fast forward to uni, I had missed a note on the slide and I turned to her to ask her if she could give me that note and she covered her page with her hand and said « you should have paid attention »
They would borrow keerthana’s and my buss pass to get home. One day they lost it. They didn’t even offer to pay for it. 
This would happen all the time when I let tharshika borrow my jewelry or anything else. She’d bring it back damaged and I was expected to replace it. 
Thomena would ask me to pick up her lunch from her house and bring it to her if I was making my way to campus later in the morning. Sometimes i’d forget. One time her lunch wasn’t ready and I had to wait for her mom to finish making lunch so i could take it to her. I ended up skipping class that day because I waited for her lunch to be made.

Thomena invited me to her house to apply for university and when I had gone over, we were in the middle of applying and thomena and tharshika picked up their laptops and moved away from me. Keerthana was asking me to come sit beside her so we could apply together. I rmbr not understanding what was going on. I don’t understand why someone would sound so caring to invite me over to their house but then leave me stranded. This was a reoccurring thing. We joined a dance competition and tharshika had been the one to ask me if I wanted to tryout with them. We all got chosen to join the dance group and we went to practice together. On performance day, we were all in our costumes and they had asked me to take pictures of them. Once I had finished taking their pics, they got their phone back and walked out the room. I didn’t get to take pics in my costumes not with them and they didn’t care.

I just don’t understand if they were friends why they would keep calling me to join them. I mean I guess I know now I was the victim they enjoyed bullying.
As a group we would pitch in to buy the birthday girl a present and this time the birthday girl was thomena. So me and tharshika thought we’d go shopping together to grab her a present and the whole time we were there she was on the phone with her boyfriend. Not once did she say hey I’m doing something with my friend for another friend so I will get back to you when I can. Both of them would keep showing up to the doorway of my classroom in high school and they would wave and try mouthing something to me. In particular when tharshika forgot her running shoes, she and thomena would show up to my classroom in high school and ask the teacher if they could speak to me. I would step out and tharshika would ask me to trade my shoes for her flats. I would do it. Later, if I asked to borrow her hair tie she would say no and no was her final answer. Thomena tharshika and keerthana would all share my lunch when they didn’t bring there’s and keerthana would eat my pizza but continue to say it doesn’t taste good. When I worked at Tim Hortons, they  would always ask for iced coffee and then once I gave it to them free of charge, they would say it never tasted good at the location I worked at. But they would still ask for more. Tharshika had told me her boyfriend was autistic and how he was hitting on her and she would say it in a way that sounded like a complaint and she would say that she didn’t  like him cuz he’s autistic. Later he would become her boyfriend and I found out that the guy hitting on her wasn’t autistic but he had a autistic brother. There were so many double standards with them.

We’d pass by them in the gym as they were heading out and we were coming in, they would laugh like they didn’t even know us. Keerthana had asked me for my password to the student locker account. I said many times I didn’t want to give it to her and she kept asking. So I caved and I gave her my password. Eventually keerthana had ghosted me and started hanging out with the everyone else as if I didn’t know those ppl either. And when I found out someone had hacked my fb I blamed it on keerthana and dhanuja and shanoo cuz all of a sudden they became besties and started hanging out and I found that weird cuz we all knew each other. However, keerthana pretended as if I didn’t know them and they pretended as if we weren’t a part of the same social circle. And keerthana had one of my passwords which meant she had all of my passwords cuz all my passwords were the same. Thomena had asked me for my password. And so did tharshika. But I had told them if I give it to you and some thing goes wrong the blame is gonna fall on you because I don’t share my password with anyone . At that time you couldn’t even delete fb accounts. As I said I blamed shanoo, dhanuja and keerthana. Before I did that tho, I told all of them together (in person) that someone had hacked my fb. And no one cared enough to help me figure it out or ask if I was ok. Thomena and tharshika had invited me to go to soki’s house for her birthday and she told me not to tell keerthana about it. And I still had my fb issue on my mind. Again I tried opening up about it and no one seemed to care. The three of them were giving each other piggy back rides.  I had a panick attack twice around thomena and tharshika. Once the day before the exam and one on the day of the exam. On the day of the exam, I told them I couldn’t breathe and my heart was racing really fast. Thatshika had turned around and said do you need help. I felt bad cuz they had a exam so I said it’s fine you study for your exam. And then we wrote the exam and I came out. We were all sitting on a bench. They were discussing the exam questions and the panic attack got worse. I kept asking them for help. But they wouldn’t turn around. I got desperate for help and I thought if I talk to them about the exam questions I could get their attention and they still wouldn’t turn around. They got up  and left to walk towards the bus and I tried so hard to keep up cuz there was nooen else around and I couldn’t breathe. Eventually the whole group had cut me off, gaslighted the fuck out of me, and said things like we are protecting our feelings and mental health or we don’t want to engage with this topic anymore. Even when I was working, if a coworker had spoke to me. As soon as the conversation was over, I would turn back to face them and thomena would say « if you talk to her watch what happens ». But she was allowed to make friends at her workplace and introduce them to our group of friends.
 This is the same person that tried to slap me because I said hey to her. It’s funny tho because the same person they didn’t want anything to do with, soki and keerthana went to go meet up with during the time that my mental health had severely depleted. But they could never make an effort to check up on the person ( me ) who was there all these years for them. They didn’t even bother celebrating my birthday after my 21st. No one showed up to my house , in fact they thought it was okay to argue with me at my lowest point. I started calling them out on their behaviour. I even gave them a chance to speak about anything I have done to hurt them and none of them said anything. They all said they had nothing to say. I even told each of them the crap they said to me about each other. Apparently after they would meet up and talk things through. But again. I was left out of that discussion because I was deemed to be the problem.  Dhanuja  and shanoo would ignore my messages when I wished them for their birthdays and invited them to go out. The rest of the group just stopped inviting me to things. And tharshika would say sorry but she wouldn’t do anything to change her character to make me feel more comfortable. It was more like I’m sorry but this friendship is over.  Or a way of saying something to shut me up. What I found the most disturbing was that this was a group of Tamil girls hating on a Tamil girl. Unfortunately there are no good laws protecting victims of this kind of bullying. In the end, toxic people like them get away with this crap so I’m leaving this here to help others identify red flags in their relationships.",1,1733083388.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False
1h4c214,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1h4c214/fallout_w_my_best_friend_of_10_years/,Fallout w/ my best friend of 10+ years,"A bit of context if I may - last year, I (27F) went through a major breakup from an abusive partner whom I was with for about 8 years. I was an absolute mess afterwards, both from the breakup and processing all the abuse that happened during the relationship. Additionally, my ex began to stalk and harass me a few weeks after our split, which lead to hefty attorney costs and stomach turning court proceedings. I won’t get into details since this isn’t what the post is about, but it was very scary and an incredibly stressful time in my life. My best friend was there for me throughout all of that and really helped me get back on my feet afterwards. 

Some time later, after some reflecting/soul searching/therapy, I felt ready to date again. To the apps I went 🫡 I went on a few dates, and although I wasn’t expecting anything serious, I was actively seeking genuine connection. I eventually met a GREAT guy who is now my treasured partner. At first it was a slow burn, we got along very well and were just having some lighthearted fun together. Well, lighthearted fun turned into meeting the families and I love you’s, fast forward to today and I’m feeling so lucky that I found my person. His love is so healing, I’m able to share every dark bit of my past and he meets it with genuine consideration and support every time. He treats me the way everyone deserves to be treated, a way that I thought would not be possible to find so soon after starting to date again. He is a sweet genuine person, and legit makes everyone else’s boyfriend look bad (jokes) - he opens the car door for me like a classic gentleman, surprises me with gifts that are truly *me* on random occasions, and consistently does acts of service like running errands for me, doing car maintenance on my car (HOT🥵😂), making my favorite cup of coffee every morning, etc. On top of all that, his family is truly amazing and they have welcomed me as one of their own, I love them all so much. There is really no other way to say it, his love heals a part of me I didn’t know needed healing every day. 

I introduced him to my best friend and our friend group while we were newly dating, before we were “official,” and it seemed to go well. We had a handful of dinners together, went out to shows and movies, etc. and a couple months later my best friend and her husband found out she was pregnant with their first child, we were all so excited and happy for them to be starting their family. I began to feel some distance between my best friend and I, and I didn’t take it personal - I thought it made sense that we weren’t talking or hanging out as frequently, since she and her husband were preparing their life and their home for their very first baby. We still hung out occasionally, and I was delighted to shower her with many gifts for her new baby throughout her pregnancy. 

About 3 weeks before she gave birth, we went out together to have a spa day. I was confiding in her about my sweet grandma, who passed away the day before (long battle with dementia), and I shared that I was feeling very emotionally raw and felt a lot of grief for losing her, and also sympathy and sadness for the rest of the family. I was really feeling heartbroken that day and I thought about rescheduling, but I felt like it would be nice to have a day to unwind at the spa after a very stressful and emotionally exhausting week. After our appointment, we started talking about how her pregnancy was going, if she felt ready for the baby to come, etc. and she eventually asked how my boyfriend and I had been doing. I shared how happy and secure I felt, how much fun we had been having on some summer trips we had gone on, and that we had been discussing shared goals for our future, like buying a house. 

Now let’s get to the point of the post already 😅 - Out of what seemed to be absolutely nowhere, she blurted that she wasn’t my boyfriend’s “biggest fan,” and that she thought I could do better. I don’t think I would have gotten upset on a normal day, but I was immediately fighting back tears since I was feeling so raw from losing my grandma. She proceeds to tell me that she hasn’t been inviting me/us to things lately because everyone in the friend group feels the same. Once she made it clear her and the group had been talking about it for an entire year, I couldn’t keep the tears from flowing. I didn’t want to say anything to make her upset since she was very pregnant, but I felt very hurt by what she was telling me. She referenced how I told her that I wasn’t in love with my boyfriend at the beginning of our relationship, and wanted a truly “great love” for me instead of my relationship which just seemed “easy” and “convenient” to her. I tried to explain (through sobs) that our relationship had grown since then and that I love him. I asked her what she didn’t like about him, and also what she meant by me doing better. She could not answer either of those questions- she said it really wasn’t anything specifically about him, just that his calm personality/demeanor didn’t mesh well with the friend group since they are all “very type A,” by her classification. She then started to backpedal, said that she and the group just needed to give him a chance because they really never did, and that they were being “cliquey assholes” about all of this. She vowed to talk to the rest of the group and that she would make plans for all of us so that the group could give my boyfriend “another chance.” 

I tried to accept what she had told me, but I was so upset I couldn’t even sleep that night and I could not stop crying. What specifically hurt is the realization that while I was giving her the benefit of the doubt for creating distance, she was intentionally avoiding me and talking about my relationship in a negative way with her friend group. For an entire year. It didn’t feel right to bring my boyfriend around them like nothing had happened. Even myself for that matter - how could I have genuine interactions with them, knowing what I know now, and not think about what they would say about me/us when we’re not around? The next morning, I texted her to share how I was feeling and expressed that I was only telling her because I didn’t want resentment to build and make the situation worse between us. She thanked me for telling her, but basically reverted to her original position, saying she didn’t believe my boyfriend would make me happy forever and that she wasn’t sorry for talking about it behind my back, since all she did was answered honestly when someone asked about her opinion of my boyfriend. Every message we exchanged that day broke my heart a little more. It ended with her saying that she will always want the best for me and that she was sorry it wasn’t her right now. 

We went silent on each other until about a week after she gave birth - she messaged me a picture of her baby, thanked me for the changing pad I had gotten for her, and said she hoped everything was going well. I congratulated her and expressed I was genuinely happy for her and her family. We had another discussion about the situation and it again went nowhere. At this point I feel that we can’t be friends until she takes accountability, and I know that likely will not happen. I’m really just confused about all of this and it’s hard to accept. Thoughts/advice on how I should move forward? TIA❤️",2,1733083368.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

Humans are what make it loud.

I’m sure you’ve been to at least one funeral in your life, whether you barely remember it or it just happened yesterday. If the latter is the case, my condolences to you.

Loss is a universal experience. Almost everyone has been in a graveyard before. I remember picking at the grass as they buried my grandfather, the sun beating down on my pigtail braids and making me sweat through the sundress my mother put me in. Little black bahiagrass seeds clung to my fingers as they lowered him into the ground. 

Graveyards are mostly silent. Besides the hushed whispers and sobs of people, and the faint sound of birdsong and wind through the dry trees, nothing stirs. It all rolls beneath the heavy silence like water under a fish trawler. When you’re alone, paying your respects to people you don’t remember or people whose loss makes you forget how to live, it’s even quieter— like the world around you has died too.

Rot isn’t like that. Decay is loud, hot, gross, and putrid. It’s like bad sex. It makes your skin crawl off your spine and melt away as your organs turn to soup. It turns your bones into yellow twigs and sends the maggots and worms and god knows what else to feast on what’s left, like whipped butter spread onto toast. Rot howls and shakes until the wooden box or shallow hole that holds it collapses and leaves pockmarks in the thirsty dirt. 

In our case, rot slammed its cracked hooves against the table as it bellowed out a war cry in my kitchen. 

I was only able to shield Dawson for a moment, crying for him to look out, before he shoved me to the side. The Rot lunged from the table and connected its front hooves to his collarbone, sending him crashing into the wall. His head snapped to the side at an odd angle as the wood splintered, and he twitched for a moment before letting out a loud groan and slumping to the floor. He wasn’t dead, but blood ran down the side of his head like streaks of melting ice cream. 

I threw myself without hesitation into its back, pummeling my fists into its spine, making dry snaps and cracks. It wrapped its lower half, suddenly longer, against my waist and slingshotted me into the kitchen door. The wood held, but the glass shattered all over me, landing in my hair like a shitty crown. 

Dawson had disappeared, and I sincerely hoped he had gone somewhere safe. As the Rot scrambled toward me, its jaw unhinged and a long, pale tongue fell out of its mouth and dragged along the floor. I staggered to my feet, and it froze. I stared it down with all the fury and bravery I had left, which was a lot. Maybe it actually was thinking about going away. Maybe it knew I wasn’t scared.

I watched in horror as the Rot rose up toward the ceiling, slimy and decomposed skin folding out like a waterlogged accordion as its bones rearranged underneath. When it was done, it looked down at me from a full seven feet high with two extra legs. Its fly-infested ears brushed my ceiling. My legs began to move on their own, walking me around the towering monstrosity as its cow lips pulled back over its dark teeth. 

*Woooooorm foooooooooood. Rotted intooooo the sooooooil, Newport*

I wanted to puke when it said my name, but my body desperately held onto what little food it had been given recently. The Rot clacked its teeth together and shambled forward with unsteady weight, like a deflating tube man. My back hit the table, and when it leaned in, it ran its cold, fat, and dripping tongue over my face like an affectionate dog. I couldn’t stop myself; I screamed, and that’s when I heard the pounding footsteps coming downstairs.

“NEWPORT! DUCK!”

I was definitely at the edge of going into shock, but Dawson’s voice brought me out of it just enough to drop to the floor. I watched as he leaped over the table and grand slammed the stock of Alice right into the side of the Rot. The splitting sound it made as chunks of wood flew in every direction was euphoric but not nearly as much as the Rot’s distorted moos of agony. Dawson hit it again, this time in the head, and it sprawled over and into the wall, exploding like overripe fruit into hundreds of tiny patches of mold. They crept down the walls and into the baseboards, slowly disappearing. 

The adrenaline flooded out of me, and I collapsed to the floor in a heap. Dawson ran over, dropping Alice and pulling me up enough to sit in one of the chairs. Blood was drying all the way down from his hairline to the collar of his shirt, the side of his face was covered with cuts and scratches, and he was limping a little. I checked his eyes and asked him all the obligatory questions about my fingers, the date, and the President. Besides the visible injuries, his impromptu trip into the wall hadn’t seemed to do any lasting damage. 

I grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him as hard as I dared, given what had happened to him.

“Stop! Saving! My! Life!”

He pulled a look that was a little indignant but mostly amused. He chuckled, and I grimaced.

“You can’t tell me to stop caring about you! Stop almost dying, and I’ll stop saving your life! Until then, get used to it, buddy!”

I stared at him for a second, and he stared right back. Then I jumped up and wrapped my arms around him. I couldn’t come close to his python hug, but I tried my hardest. Dawson grunted in surprise, but then he went, “Oh,” like someone had just handed him a tiny, unwashed, adorable kitten. I rolled my eyes as they filled with tears.

“It doesn’t stop. It never fucking stops. It’s going to be back. It’s always going to be back, and I can’t get through this without you. I just can’t. He was right. Without you, it’ll never end.”

Dawson rubbed my back and held me close in his arms. He smelled like salt and stewed apples and pine. A feeling of utter safety washed over me as he pressed my head into his shoulder. 

“I told you, Newport. I’m not leaving you. I’ll never leave you. I promise. We’re going to figure out how to end it together. Night of the Living Burger doesn’t stand a chance as long as we have each other.”

Both of us jumped at a noise from outside. It was a small clatter, like a stone hitting a wall. I grabbed what was left of Alice and shoved Dawson behind me. He tried to switch us around again, but I didn’t let him this time. I ran through the front door and found one of the last things I wanted to see right then. 

The protection talisman lay on the porch, the rope unwound to nothing, and the crystal split into a hundred tiny pieces. We weren’t safe anymore. No wonder it had jumpscared me in my own kitchen. 

“Fuck. *Fuck.*”

Dawson picked up what remained of the gem he could and it crumbled to dust. He looked out at the road and then back at me with a heavy air of nausea.

“I… I think I’m going to have to go back to my parents. We don’t have anything here to protect us both. I’ll give you my necklace until I get back.”

I’d been reluctant the first time he did it, but it just wasn’t happening a second time. Not when that thing was out there— while it crawled around on six legs like an insect and recited my name perfectly. 

“No. Absolutely not. Frosty the Snowman is selling popsicles in Hell before that’s happening. Besides, I… I think I might have something that can help us. I don’t know how well it will protect us from whatever this is, but it’s worth a shot.”

Dawson seemed unsure, but he agreed to go up there with me. We climbed up to the bathroom and made a detour to clean up Dawson’s ‘horror movie makeup’; then I grabbed the attic hatch, Dawson following on my heels like a puppy. 

“You know, I’ve never been up here. I always wondered what that hatch was. Kinda weird to have one in the bathroom.”

I went to answer, but Dawson held up a hand.

“No, don’t tell me. This is the actual entrance to Overall Land, isn’t it?”

I pulled the hatch down, and a cloud of dust floated down, sprinkling into my hair along with what glass I couldn’t shake out. Even if I came up here every day, it would still be just as dusty. There was something about the attic that was perpetually forgotten.

“Oh no, I should’ve told you about this before, Dawson. Shame on me. It’s actually an express passageway to your mother’s bedroom.”

Dawson scoffed and began climbing the rickety ladder. Maybe it wasn’t the best time for jokes, but they were our bad coping skills, and we were going to use them however the hell we wanted.

“As if you could bag my mom.”

I went up right behind him, the wood trembling underneath our weight. The smell of motheaten clothes and milky mildew filled my nose, nostalgic and sad at the same time.

“Who said I was after your mom, Dawson?”

I watched the gears turn in his head in the manmade darkness. Then he let out a bark of a laugh. 

“Oh, you’re WEIRD for that one, Newport. So weird.”

We shuffled through the clutter, purpose momentarily forgotten.

“Awh, you don’t have to be mad that I’m madly in love with your—“

“Hey, what’s this?”

Dawson held out a framed photograph. A gold band ran around the outside, and inside, I sat among the parts of a soon-to-be-built chicken coop. That summer, our old one had been destroyed by a tornado. I’d been so devastated by the loss that my dad had taken me out and let me pick out a new chick for the coop. Bluebells poked up from the ground in small clumps around the picture’s edges.

“Is that who I think it is?”

I looked close, not that I had to, and nodded.

“Yep. That’s good ol Beelzebub.”

I took the photo and ran my fingers along the outer edge. It was unnaturally cold, like it had been pulled out of the grave.

“Mini Beez is adorable, but that’s not what I meant. Is that you?”

It was a question we both knew the answer to, so I wasn’t really sure why he asked it. The little girl that was and wasn’t me wore a too-large sunhat and a pair of dirty pink overalls, her horse shirt stained with lemonade and Salty Dog. My grandmother made ice cream herself sometimes. Salty Dog was a French cream base with a bit of peanut butter, chocolate chunks, pretzels, and salt. 

My childish grin was frozen in time, missing two front teeth and framed by long waves of black hair. The conviction behind it faded not long after my father took that picture.

Dawson looked at it for a long time, then at me. I trusted him more than I’d ever trusted someone else in a long time, but that intrusive fear still remained in the back of my mind. I braced for the words despite myself, but he caught me off guard.

“Are you happy, Newport? I mean, I know that, obviously, you’re not *totally* happy right now, given the circumstances. But I mean… you know. With your identity.”

It had been longer than I could remember since someone had asked me that. I touched the bruises below my ribcage lightly and smiled. The answer snuck up on me.

“Yeah. I am. ‘Specially with you around.”

“Good. And for the record, I never thought a thing about it. Not even for a second.” 

His smile matched mine, and I sat the photo down gently in an open box. Most of them were open. After my dad was gone, my mom spent a lot of days up here, touching and crying over her pieces of the past. 

The red mold had begun to grow mushrooms, thick ones with neon green caps that added to the ruddy hues in an unseasonably merry marriage. The light glimmered on the various odds and ends in the attic: a miniature, retro gas pump, a tattered minnow net with mismatched weights, a busted radio headset, and… wait, was that half a kidney? No, no, just ignore Newport. It’s not either of yours, and one man’s organ is another man’s hors d’oeurves.   

“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, what’s this?”

Dawson showed me a cowbell missing its hammer, rusted with age, with two tiny F’s etched carefully on the lip. 

“Oh, that belonged to my old steer, French Fry. He’s been dead for a while now. My dad left us, and a few days later, he just dropped like a stone out in the pasture. That cow loved my dad like he was his own father. Guess he couldn’t take the loss.” 

Dawson gave the bell a few pitiful shakes, but it gave off little more than flakes of rust. 

“That’s… so sad.”

He paused.

“Hey, uh, if it’s personal, you can tell me to shut up, but… what happened with your dad?”

The truth was I didn’t really know. Even when he’d sent me the lighter, there were apologies, there was a check, but there were no explanations. 

“It’s not too personal, but I don’t think I can give you a satisfying answer like ‘Oh, he cheated, and my mom told him to hit the bricks’ or ‘he ran off to join the circus.’ I don’t know why he left. I only know that it wasn’t mine or my mother’s fault because that’s what he told me when I heard from him last. There was a letter, but my mom never let me read it, and I don’t know where it is now. I don’t know where he is now.”

“Oh. That’s… wow.”

I wished I could cry about it, but the tears didn’t come. I just stared at the cowbell, feeling over the notches and grooves when Dawson offered it to me. Telling him lifted a weight off my shoulders, but the sadness never diminished.

“Usually, if a cow or pig died like that, we’d use the meat. But my mom insisted we bury him. She dug his grave herself. It’s out in the pasture.”

Dawson looked past me, clutching the bell tighter in his calloused hands. Instead of apologies I didn’t need or more questions I didn’t want to answer, he gave me a small and sorrowful smile. 

“Hey. When this is all over, we should take his bell to him. I think he’d like to have it back.”

I nodded, and he stuffed it into my front overall pocket. I brushed my fingers over the indent and felt better than any other consoling he could’ve given me.

After wading through to the deepest reaches of the attic, like something had hidden it from us, I found the witch bells. My mom wasn’t a witch, but several of my distant ancestors had been, casting spells and dancing around a bonfire late into the night while their farmer husbands slept. The bells were an heirloom; I could remember them jingling on our front door when I was a lot smaller. I held the wreath at the end, silver and copper bells tinkling against each other and the smell of dried herbs filling my nose.

“These have been in my family for generations. They’re supposed to keep evil spirits away. I probably should’ve remembered them by now, but I try not to think about my mother that often if I’m being honest.”

I knew he wanted to know but didn’t want to ask. He respected me too much. But I told him anyway. 

“She loved my dad. I know she did. She loved him so much. I think when he left, she got this crack in her. And it just kept getting wider and wider until it split open completely. One night, when I was 14, I think it was August, I watched from my window as she walked out onto the porch, stripped down to nothing, and ran off down our dirt road. I waited and waited, but she never came back. Eventually, I stopped waiting. I never saw her again.”

Dawson grimaced. I took a deep breath, happy to have it all off my chest. So glad to say it all out loud to someone, even if that made the years-old ache feel fresh. 

“You really have lost everyone, haven’t you?”

The regret showed on his face the second he said it, but I wasn’t upset. I’d long since accepted it as fact, even if it still stung occasionally. 

“Yeah. It’s been hard here alone, but until now, I’ve managed. Just know that’s the risk you’re taking being around me. I’m probably cursed or something.”

He shook his head and did his best to turn the grimace into a smile. 

“Well, that’s a risk I’m willing to take. But as far as the other stuff, I want you to know that I get it. Well, I get it a little. I’d say I wish I got it more, but I think that’s fucked up to say. My sister died.”

Dawson let the explosion from that bomb settle into the dust before he spoke again. 

“That sounds worse than it is. My big sister died before I was born. My mom had a lot of issues having a kid before me, and she was the first baby to make it to term. When she finally came out, she lived for nine and a half minutes.”

“No, Dawson, that sounds exactly as bad as it is. You didn’t even get a chance to know her. I can’t imagine how that was for your mom. I’m sure you’ve heard it before, but I’m sorry.” 

Dawson winced and nodded.

“It’s alright. And yeah, okay, it was definitely bad. My mom doesn’t really talk about that time in her life. She just reminds me that I’m her rainbow baby every other day. I don’t mind it; it feels nice to be someone’s hope. Other than that, my uncle disappeared, but that happened before my parents even met. Sorry I didn’t bring it up before, but I don’t like to think about it much, that sibling I missed.”

His words struck something in my brain, like blue neon running through coils of tempered glass. *That sibling I missed.* If I squinted hard enough, I was sure I’d be able to see it: the basket for fruit, withered with age and denial. I couldn’t eat blackberries anymore. They tasted like blood. 

There was something more I wanted to tell Dawson. Something that hid in the back corner of my mind, just like that basket. But the words wouldn’t come, and then the moment was lost. 

That wasn’t the fault of any awkwardness, though. It was because I screamed. Herbivore teeth dug into the meat of my leg, struck against rocks and gnawed against bones to sharpen their linear edges. It had followed us up here. 

My blood dribbled down the white jawbone, its patchy neck winding away into the darkness like a sun-scorched garden hose. I felt something pull painfully under my skin as the Rot began to tug. Dawson’s face went quickly from confusion to rage, and he grabbed the nearest thing to use as a weapon.

The Rot wasn’t very pleased when Dawson threw the book at it. But it didn’t react with hissing and screeching like your average demon would when hit with a bible explicitly made for “God’s Little Princesses’ as the cover proclaimed. Its jaw clamped harder on my ankle, and I cried out again. 

Dawson turned for only a second, making a desperate grab for the baseball bat only just out of reach, and that was all it took. It yanked my feet out from underneath me with all the power of a semi-truck, and my nails dug fruitlessly into old wood as it dragged me toward the attic hatch.

“NEWPORT! HOLD ON, I’M COMING!”

The last thing I saw before I was pulled from the attic was Dawson tripping over a loose coil of cow neck and crashing into a tower of boxes like a meat-filled bowling ball. Whether he wanted to or not, I knew there would be no saving my life this time unless I did it myself. 

As it pulled me into the hallway, its disgusting body snapped into place and slithered right along after it. I gripped tight onto anything I could, but all I got for my trouble was bloody fingers and split nails. The hold it had on my ankle went down to the bone, and I was lucky it hadn’t split in two. I thought briefly of the man who cut his own arm off to free himself from under a boulder— of coyotes chewing their legs off to escape traps. Even if I could’ve managed that, there just wasn’t any time. 

Backward down the stairs I went, the cowbell clunking hollowly against them. My teeth rattled and cut into my lip as I tried to flip onto my back and failed. 

“WHY WON’T YOU JUST LEAVE US ALONE?! WE NEVER DID ANYTHING TO YOU!”

It hissed at me through tight teeth.

*The roooooottttt coooooomes for yooooooou aaaaaaall in the eeeeeeeeend*

When we reached the bottom, I clung to the banister, holding on with everything I had left in me. The Rot groaned in irritation, blasting pain up my leg with each impatient tug, like I was making it late for monster church or something.

Then there was a sound I don’t think I or the beast had been expecting to hear. The laughter of a small child, a baby, filled the kitchen. I kept my hold on the banister but looked up to see Aunt Jean standing by the doorway. Her mouth had returned to its empty voidstate, but more than that, twin blood trails ran out of her dilated eyes. When I say dilated, I mean *dilated*. If there wasn’t the thinnest sliver of white at the edges, I would’ve thought her entire sclera had turned black. 

She was the one laughing, tittering to herself in the voice of an infant. The Rot, only momentarily puzzled by this display, began trying to get me out the door again. That’s when it all changed.

Something moved underneath the yellow dress Aunt Jean wore, alive and writhing. I could hear the creaks and snaps as old lady joints shifted and broke. The Rot responded in kind, returning to the centipede state I’d seen in the forest cornfield. If Aunt Jean had spoken then, I would’ve imagined her saying something like, “Close your eyes, chickadee. I’d hate for you to see me in such a state.” So that’s what I did. For good measure, I heard the lightbulb above us burst, and the kitchen was plunged into the near darkness of twilight. 

The next few moments were blurry and dark, carried only by the few times my eyes slipped open. I was thrown around in the iron grip of the Rot as I listened to tearing flesh and the echoing warcry of a thousand different voices. I caught glances of a ribcage, open and fanned out like the wings of an avenging angel, and of a hanging mouth full of angler-sharp teeth. I couldn’t discern which warring party they belonged to, but I hoped Aunt Jean was winning. 

Eventually, all the frantic motion stopped. I opened my eyes and saw what I had been dreading. There was a new crack in my wall, plaster and drywall rising up from the middle like desert dirt, and beneath it was Aunt Jean. Her dress was in tatters, and she was as soaked in blood as the ground the day I met her, a thin layer of dust powdered across her curled-in body. She was breathing, if only just.

I screamed again, this time in rage. The Rot’s skull was now wholly stripped of meat save for its remaining eye, long slashes running down its neck where fur and necrotic skin had been ripped away by the claws of a protective and inhuman aunt. 

“YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS! YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS! YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS!”

It was all I could say, a broken record with no end. I bashed at it with the hollow cowbell, my only weapon. Its body became rigid again, kicking open the front door with hooves as strong as a piledriver. I screamed and kicked as we left the porch, determined that I, at the very least, wasn’t going to make an easy meal. 

The last rays of the sun had drowned in the darkness, and the only light left was the ember of the porch light, quickly growing distant. That, and the eyeshine off the Pigman, standing in the field. Well, standing wasn’t the right word. He was rocking back and forth on his heels, making all sorts of noises. I wouldn’t have been surprised if the fucker was enjoying watching me get cow-napped. I could hear Dawson crying out my name from the house, and the pulling got faster. He wasn’t going to make it in time. He’d race out here only to find my husk of a corpse, if he even found me. 

The cornrows we passed were dry and dying, a bitter reminder of my failure at the worst possible time. I dug my bare, unbitten foot into the dirt, but it did nothing to stop it. Somehow, I suddenly knew that it was dragging me to the last field, where my property ended, and that’s where I would die. I’d never been more sure of anything in my life. I wouldn’t even get a final cigarette. 

At the thought of a cigarette, an idea bloomed in my head, like a forest fire devouring a match factory. I remembered how the shadows had shied away from the porch light. I remember stories told to me when I was no taller than a half-stalk of corn, about beasts that turned to stone when the sun came up and red-eyed, withered giants that feared the wave of a torch.

Maybe the Rot didn’t fear the light, but all creatures of the dark yield to fire.

I felt around in my pocket as my chin was scraped bloody against the hard, brown dirt. My fingers closed around the blocky case of the lighter, and I pulled it out, praying that I’d been a diligent son and refilled it with lighter fluid before I went into my porch fugue. I tore a dry stalk free and held it close as it gave a few pitiful sparks. Once the lighter caught, the corn went up in a roar of flame and a mini cloud of dark smoke. 

“Why won’t you DIE?! DIE! JUST DIE ALREADY!”

I swung the stalk at the Rot, and it cawed out in surprise and rage— an actual and very angry call of a crow. I struck a second time with all the fervor of a major league mercenary and this time it connected. Flames licked at the bone, and the hair remaining on its neck went up in stinking flames. It finally released my ankle, which made the pain ten times worse. With one more hit, missed by an inch, it fled into the field, disappearing into a blotch of mold, then nothing at all. 

“COME BACK HERE! COME BACK, YOU FUCKING COWARD!”

I stood there, screeching into the night, until the adrenaline wore off, and I collapsed from my injured ankle. The only other sound was the shush of ghostly wind in the trees, Dawson’s heavy footsteps as he ran toward me, and the crackle of the burning stalk still in my hand. 

When Dawson reached me, he stomped out the blackened cob and picked me up like always, running back for the house as fast as he could with a limp that I now matched. 

“Fuck, I thought you were done for. I hate to say it, but I really thought that it would drag you away, and I’d never see you again.”

“Gee, thanks. Shows how much faith you have in me.” 

I was halfway just giving him shit, but he shook his head adamantly.

“No, no, I didn’t mean it like that. I was just scared for you, is all. So crazy, pants-pissingly scared. But look, you did it. You saved your own life all by yourself!”

A monolithic realization crashed down on me at once, and the tears threatening to spill finally made it past my eyelids. My chest shook, and I shivered as I held out my lighter. 

I knew the kind of friend Dawson was. I knew he’d found my lighter where I’d left it on my nightstand and shoved it into the pocket of the clothes I’d put on, figuring I’d probably want a smoke sooner rather than later. Dawson thought about even the smallest things. And by extension, I would’ve lost the lighter itself long ago if he hadn’t brought it to me that one fateful afternoon. 

Dawson had saved my life yet again, without even trying. He seemed to realize it at the same time I did. 

“Oh. Silly me. I guess I—“

“Thank you.”

By the look on his face, he’d expected me to admonish him like I’d done before. But I couldn’t bring myself to, and I didn’t want to anyway. 

“You didn’t have to bring me back this lighter. You didn’t have to do any of the things you’ve done. You could’ve jumped off this crazy trainwreck as soon as the Rot got serious, but you stayed. I can’t thank you enough. I know I act like you annoy me, and I probably still will a little, but the truth is, if you left right now, I think I’d die. And not just because of the killer munch I’ve got on my ankle.”

Dawson let me down, staring at me for a long second. His lower lip trembled, and then he pulled me into another hug. It wasn’t like others before it, weak-armed and trembling as he sniffled into my hair. Whether we stood there for minutes or for centuries, it all felt the same.

We both jumped like spooked rabbits when we heard a long *creeeeeaaaakkkk* oh the stairs. I think we both expected another assault from the Rot, but instead, we saw a much friendlier face. 

Aunt Jean slowly descended the stairs, not as broken as she had been, but with slight mottles of bruises and the light stain of blood across her pale skin. She wore little more than a night slip and a pair of socks. God, she was *okay.*

“Aunt Jean! I thought you were a goner!”

I rushed over to her as fast as I could given the state of my leg, and for the first time, I threw my arms around her small frame. The hug was long overdue and just as motherly as I expected, and I closed my sore eyes as she smoothed my hair back with a wrinkled hand. In a voice that sounded like a thousand buzzing cicadas and the crack of dry wood— her true voice, if she had one —she spoke a single word to me: “Chickadee.”

I held onto her and cried some more as if I hadn’t cried enough that night. My leg was really starting to hurt— a burning sting that made goosebumps creep up my arms and had me craving to dig my hands into my stomach and physically force away the nausea. 

“Promise me you won’t get yourself hurt like that again.”

I knew it was a promise she wouldn’t be able to keep, but I wanted her to tell me so anyway. She nodded, gently guiding me to the table where Dawson was opening a first aid kit. The second I sat down, he lifted my leg and examined the bite wound.

He looked it over for a long time, saying nothing. When he did speak, his voice was quiet.

“This bite is nasty, Newport. I think it’s already starting to get infected. I’m taking you to the hospital tomorrow.”

I tried to object, but the pain shut me up. Dawson gave me the same treatment I’d given him: cleaning and bandaging the wound. He packed the gauze in extra tight, making sure not even a trickle of free-running blood was left. 

By the time he was done, the moon hung fat and yellow just out the window. My coffee machine grumbled to life as Aunt Jean fiddled with it. 

“It’s not done with us. All of this, and it’s still not fucking done with us.”

I pulled my arms around myself and shivered. It was that time of year when the nights rarely got below 70°, but a chill was quickly invading my body. 

“I know. I realize that. But you’re more important. Right now, we need to rest and regroup. Aunt Jean, I sincerely hope that’s decaf.”

She smiled a knowing smile, and I raised an eyebrow.

“You must’ve pulled that out of a coffee pocket dimension because this house has never seen a single bean of decaf since I’ve been living here.” 

Dawson brought the mugs over once they were full. I wrapped my hands around the mug and hovered my face over the steamy warmth of it. It felt like someone stuck my feet into an icebox.

“Maybe we should cut our losses and go live in the coffee pocket dimension.” 

“As tempting as that sounds, I doubt it would be animal-friendly.”

I took a long sip as Dawson lit one of the emergency candles I kept in the junk drawer. The kitchen filled with flickering orange light, casting funhouse shadows across the walls. 

Fever chills ran up and down my arms and legs, no matter how much coffee I drank. I unconsciously moved closer to the candle flame, soaking up the faint shimmer of heat it left across my face. Somewhere in the distance, I heard the tinkling of bells. I tried to think of witches— pale women dancing naked in the light of roaring flames and roasting alive in that same blaze. I tried to think of how this coffee tasted like dirt water. I tried to think of how the candlelight lashed across Dawson’s dark skin and glowed in his swampy eyes.

But I couldn’t think about any of it. Because I was goddamn freezing.

“I’m going to build a bonfire.”

Dawson and Aunt Jean turned from where they were looking out the window, eyes now fixed on me and filled with worry. It pissed me off. Hadn’t they ever been cold before? It wasn’t like I was dying. 

I wasn’t dying. 

“Are you sure that’s a good idea? The ground is kinda dry, and I wouldn’t want us to start a—“

“Yes, I’m sure, I’m colder than a witch’s tit in a brass bra, and that thing is scared of fire. We’ll gather all the animals up, and if we stay near it, maybe we can last the night. We just need to make it to daylight. We’ve got to make it to daylight.” 

My teeth chattered as I talked, and when I was done, I had to grit my teeth hard to stop them. 

“Newport, I don’t know…”

I grabbed the candle by the end as wax began dripping onto my fingers. It burned a little, but I didn’t care. It felt good.

“Are you gonna help me or not?”

The two of them exchanged a glance before Dawson nodded.

“Of course I’ll help you, Newport. As long as you promise to sit down and get some rest after.”

I threw open the front door and looked out into the yard. I knew the perfect spot.

“Dawson, if I can get warm, I’ll dance an Irish jig for you if you want. Bad ankle and all.” 

I walked around to the coop as Dawson grabbed Alice. My feathery sentinel stood right at the door for me if she’d been expecting me. She was the only chicken awake.

Beelzebub stayed perched on my shoulder as Dawson grabbed wood from the stacks I kept just outside the forest. 

Dark shapes swayed and contorted just beyond the edge of it, in and out of the tree rows, just subtle enough to feel like it was all in your head. The moon hadn’t made far enough into the sky, making the pines look as though they stretched upward forever. Out there in the dark, there was a lone whistle. 

Something about that two-mile stretch of woods wasn’t right. Not evil, just… not right. 

I turned away from them and how they made me feel, gathering a meager load of wood in my weak arms. I stumbled, and Dawson made me lean against him.

We dumped the wood on the spot where, seven years ago, my mom had hesitated a moment before leaving me forever. Dawson poured the gas, and when I struck the match, it felt like burning away the memory of her thin, sickly body.

“Newport, when we make it out of this, I’m going to make you the best breakfast you’ve ever had.”

I appreciated his use of ‘when’ and not ‘if,’ even if I wasn’t that confident in it. As the gas-soaked wood caught with a whoosh and the flames climbed high into the sky, I swore I could smell meat. Not rotten meat, or meat raw with blood, but the warm aroma of bacon. It did little to rid me of the invasive chill, but it was nice anyway. 

I wanted to say something stupid. I wanted to tell him to be careful not to get into the updog or that I wanted a steak omelet and the Rot’s stuffed head on my desk by five o’clock this evening. I wanted to say anything that didn’t make it feel as final as it did. 

Instead, I looked up at him from where I’d laid on the ground. The deep green of his eyes shone in the bonfire. 

“It’ll be a great one,” I whispered, and he smiled even though the worry didn’t leave his face. 

Then I closed my eyes and let the world turn orange.",1,1733083345.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

First of all I don't have a pic but 2 days ago I had roughly 8 shots of vadka 40% on a empty stomach
Yesterday I woke up and felt fine at first then a couple hours later I felt ill and puked a little bit and it looked like coffee ground vomit [not alot] but not a tiny bit either. But that morning I drank alot of Gatorade that is a very dark purple so I wasn't sure if it that is what it was.
I only puked twice yesterday and didn't puke much and half of the time it was dry heaving. 
Today I feel fine but I've been scaring myself over it cuz of having high anxiety. I haven't puked anymore, i have no pain in my stomach or really anything. I looked it up and what it seems to most likely be is I had irritation in my stomach lining and bled a little bit but Idk.

will I be ok at this point and I'm not having vadka like that again and I'm no alcoholic but it scared me. 

I feel like seeing a doctor now would be pointless cuz I don't have anymore symptoms but its in the back of my mine.

I have a doctors appointment in a month and a half and I'll mention it to them.

Has anyone had this temporary experience after a hard night of drinking? Or is this something that I need to go to the er for even if I'm completely fine right now.

My roommate has been a friend of mine for 12 years, and I moved in with her last September. I'm stuck in this lease with her until June 2025. For context, I have a partner that I've been together with since March, and she does not like him for no specified reason. I have him over a lot, because I choose for him to be, and she has not liked this at all. Over the past 5 or 6 months she has gotten progressively more controlling and vindictive against us.   
When he is here he minds his business, he isn't loud, we stay in my room the entire time unless we are making food or using the bathroom. He always cleans up after himself, and even does my dishes for me and helps take out the trash, and clean out the fridge. He has never touched her things, bothered her when she's here, and doesn't even talk to her or interact with her when she is home.  
She goes to school and works 2 part time jobs, and most of her free time is spend in a different town at her partners place. She is here maybe 20% of the week.   
Me and her were splitting rent equally, but I started paying an extra $50 through my landlord for my partner to be considered and ""part-time living resident"" in our apartment because he stays over 3 nights a week.   
He has his own home, but he lives in a different town, and works really close to my home. So for us it makes sense that he is here more often than he is there.   
Despite me paying rent, and an extra $50 dollars for him to be in MY room, and him being extremely respectful of the common spaces, she has been extremely controlling and harsh towards the both of us, but mainly me. We had come up with an agreement that he can only be here 3 nights a week, and that he cannot be inside the apartment when I am not here.   
My main issue with this agreement is that I am paying extra for him to be here, and it is also freezing cold outside. He doesn't have a car at the moment, and because he lives in a different town it is hard for him to make up rides all of the time. I think it's extremely unreasonable to have to force him to be outside or loiter the apartment building for warmth while I am not home for a few hours while I'm at work. When all he would be doing while I'm not here, is sleeping in my bedroom.   
I had talked to her that I was considering paying the landlord extra to have him considered a ""full-time resident"" so that he can be here under those terms. She told me flat out that it I shouldn't because of her feelings on the matter.   
Anytime that I have ever voiced an opinion about the apartment or how I feel about her and her friends, she has always made it out that her opinion matters more, and she has never once attempted to compromise on something with me.   
All of her furniture is free to be where ever, but I have to have my furniture in the common space be under her preference. I couldn't even buy a coffee table for us because she didn't like the color.  
She get's uncomfortable and calls me a narcissist when I show interest and have conversations with her friends when they are over.   
Last week she had a friend over when she wasn't here, despite her feelings on me doing the same exact thing with my partner.  
She complains about my toilet paper use, how much trash I accumulate (even though I take it out and clean up my messes) how I make dished quicker than her. (I'm here 100% of my time unless I am at work, unlike her)  
I can't think of a single time she hasn't complained about something I'm doing, and request that it get's changed, despite her doing those things herself.   
It's very hypocritical and upsetting for me.  
Ever since we moved in here together I have tried my hardest to appease her and keep peace, comply to all of her complaints, and push down my own wants and needs just to keep her quiet. It's completely ruined my mental health.   
All the while, the things that I am doing with my own life truly don't impact her in any way. I don't worry about her life style the way she does mine. I would not care if things were flipped around.  
I'm a people pleaser at heart, and I can admit that I have let her walk all over me since living together.  
I don't know how to respectfully go about things anymore, and we are constantly stepping on each others toes.  
Neither of us can speak or ask a question without getting immediately defensive and accusatory.  
My plan is that once me and my partners checks start coming through from our new jobs, that we can start saving up a lot of money and caring less about these rules she's put in place. That I can start paying my landlord extra for him to be considered a full time resident, and not worry about what she has to think.   
But in the same realm, my anxiety is through the roof, and I'm terrified that she will try to make my life miserable the next few months if I pay for him to be here.

“Do you like pirates?”

“Sure”

“Star Wars?”

“Yea”

“What about Vikings or cars”

“Yes”

SARA: (Muttering) These awards are such a joke. Do they even know who I am?

JANHVI: (Sighing) Nepotism’s not the flex it used to be, Sara.

SHARMIN: (Whining) But I’m prettier than all of them! Why aren’t I winning?

Meanwhile, Abhay Verma and Sparsh Srivastava are called up for Best Supporting Actor awards.

ABHAY: (Grinning) From side characters to award winners. Feels surreal, doesn’t it?

SPARSH: (Laughs) Surreal? It feels earned. Unlike some people, we actually worked for this.

The camera catches Sara furiously scrolling on her phone while Sharmin pouts into the distance. The applause for Kriti and Abhay grows louder as the scene fades out.

1h4budu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Folliculitis/comments/1h4budu/scalp_infection_advice/,Scalp infection advice?,"I wrote their before and it turned into a bloody novel so I'm gonna change it. I (15f) have had a scalp infection for the last few months and I would like it to go now. I'm unable to buy any products now or I would have gotten a antibacterial shampoo by now. I do have ideas for what I can do but I though I would run it by the rest community before I did them.

But of backstory I use to have bacterial infection on my scalp (I know there's a name but I can't remember) often but they were so long ago that I don't remember getting them, I got the one I have now in August during the summer holiday and I don't go out much (really at all unless I need to go somewhere or to my family which I do go twice a week) so I hate to say it but I didn't have the best if hygiene then and wouldn't wash my hair as much as I shouldn't. Now that school is back in I'll wash my hair maybe 3 or 4 times a week oppose to 2 I think a week. I have been told many times in the last that I have really thin hair and I use to think that's a good thing so I said I loved it, I don't now, it's a pain in the ass. It might be thin, or the other world that I can't think of... FINE the word if fine! It's one of those to, I've googled it and I can't get a clear answer on which one is which. My hair also gets oily within 3 days of not washing it. By that (because it just confused me) say I wash it on Sunday, I'll need to wash it again Tuesday, I won't look bad Tuesday but it will wednesday and I don't have tjme in the morning to wash it then.

Now onto what I think would work but I'm not sure and I'm not googling them because I'm not gonna get a clear answer, I've tried and I only get recommended oils and shampoos. 

Staying hydrated: drinking plenty of water has to help, right. It would make a lot of sense for it to help because it's so important to be hydrated. The problem is I'm not often hydrated, at home or school. At home I just don't drink water, coffee yes, apple juice yes, I do have a bottle of water next to me when I go to bed to I'll drink that before I sleep, normally 150ish mils before bed. Also at school I don't drink much because my school I can only use the bathroom every 2 hours, before school, at break, at lunch, and hometime (I will be starting to finish at 4 not 3 10 so then it will be a 3 hour gap) I'm British so I understand this rule, it's annoying but normal. 

Food and drink: does certain things you ingest help it. I mean food goes into your body and your body heals things. I like fruit, I only really eat apples (rarely) grapes and bananas(a few a week) but I can only eat them when I mum buyes them in. I also eat most my vegetables (I  discovered recently I love coloflower, still don't like tomato, I try but my tounge hates them)

Hair brush: I think I know the answer but having a clean hair brush would make A LOT of sense when it comes to scalp infections. I have two brushes I'll use which ever one is closer, they're both dirty rn, I would clean them more but I have the type which is a pain in the ass to clean so I only do it a few times a year. I know, it's disgusting, I hate my self everyday because of it. 

Sleep: I'm not sure why I'm putting this here but j am. Getting enough sleep a night has to help because it gives your body energy and a few other things that I dont know because I hate biology. I do get sleep at night. A lot more than some of my friends. I'm averaging 7 hours a night, maybe more. 100% 8 hours when I don't have to go anywhere in the morning. 

Those are the main things I though of but if anyone has anything else please let me know and I'll edit it if there are any changes. 

Long post short, scalp bacterial infection i would like to get rid of but I can't send any money rn.
I'll also take advise for how to stay hydrated during the day. ",1,1733082838.0,Folliculitis,0,1.0,False
1h4btl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinalStenosis/comments/1h4btl1/my_story_of_how_i_was_diagnosed_with_cervical/,My story of how i was diagnosed with Cervical stenosis... Long read.,"So the reason I am sharing this story is because I feel like something else is wrong. After reading a month worth of r/spinalstenosis and just the overall way I feel. At least I am slowly getting better but plateauing at the same time. Prior to this I was in good health(except for weird pressure feeling in the back of my head that i had for a month) and no medications. I am a 39 year old white male.

  
So the morning of  August 18th 2024 I was just doing my regular routine. I wake up get dressed walk the dog when I come back I make some coffee with 2-3 oreos and watch a little TV while enjoying said coffee. However this time while watching TV all of a sudden my vision changed for a few seconds. Everything went sideways(room tilt illusion, I googled this term later on) Oh boy that was weird i thought to myself so I go to my room to lay down. 

Upon entering my room this huge wave of anxiety over comes me along with feeling like I am on a boat. I walked down the hallway swaying. Knowing something is not right at all I walk to a bedroom where my mother is working and tell her somethings off and i need emergency. While telling her this both my arms start tingling like crazy and my whole body just feels off. 

My mother rushes me to one of the closer hospitals. She tells them she thinks I'm having a stroke. I am rushed back into a room. This part is a little hazy for me because I think from everything happening I was also having a panic attack so they administered some anxiety medication. They check my vitals/stabilize me and were about to release me. 

However when they told me to stand up i moved my head and a huge wave of dizzyness and nausea appeared. I told the nurse the sudden movement made me feel nauseous and that I'm about to vomit. She was about to hand me a bag but it wasnt fast enough and I spewed everywhere. (sorry nurses i tried my best to hold it) I dont know for how many hours but i had to hold my head in one certain position otherwise the nausea would come back. Even when leaving my head in the sweet spot i still felt ill.

They no longer wanted to release me. They did a CT Scan where they saw i had cervical stenosis but also wanted a MRI. They had a MRI on location however they wanted to do it at their other hospital where it wouldnt be available till the next day. So while im at the hospital all that saline solution made me have to want to use the bathroom.  I felt less dizzy when moving my head so I attempted it. I got up... What the heck my right side of my body is not working properly. No pain but i could only move my right foot a tiny bit. my arm felt find except for tingling in the pink and ring finger that travel down into my hand.

Ok I can do this there is a railing. Im a grown man im walking myself. Made it to the bathroom everything was fine. A nurse checks on me hours later. I asked for food since I havent eaten all day and its probably like 6pm now. They told me I couldnt eat just incase they have to do surgery right away. Im thinking to myself this is crazy I go from watching tv to not being able to use the right side of my body and a surgery.

The next day comes, an ambulance takes me to the other hospital. I get an MRI and it is only mild cervical stenosis, the doctors do some random test on my arms and legs. They keep me till the 20th with no other news or symptoms except vertigo for the dizziness. 

Now I am home. First day was the worst. I was putting dirty dishes with my clean stuff. putting refrigerated food in the cabinets... a bunch of weird stuff like that(I still do it but not nearly as often but probably at least once a day when before it was maybe once a month). My anxiety level was a 10, which was causing my blood pressure to sky rocket.  Time to setup all my follow up appointments. One to a Ear/Nose/Throat doctor for the vertigo. One for physical therapy, one for my PCP and one for a followup neurosurgeon. Night time rolls around I cant sleep and feel/think that I am dying. 

To sum up the following couple months. I didnt notice alot of effects of what happened until I was trying to live life. My comprehension skills at first were so bad. I took 45-60 minutes to fill out that sheet you get when you go to the doctors office that normally takes 15 minutes or less. I would reread it multiple times in order to understand what it was asking of me. My comprehension skills are a lot better now but still not anywhere near where I used to be.

Physical therapy was a godsend. I went from not being able to walk my dog to at least walk him a 3 block radius. I sometimes push myself further but I get weird sensations in my head and chest so I turn around. Also my right leg gets extremely tired and always feels heavy. Some nerves came back and with that I now experience some pain in my leg. Prior to this incident I could walk for miles no problem. And im talking about 8+ miles and not feel tired at all. As i loved walking my dog to different parks. Now i have to really push myself to get to the closest park 1 mile away. I used to be able to do 45 pushes to being able to do 4 very shaky ones. I cant over exhurt myself because my vision gets weird and I get dizzy when my heart rises. (Went to heart specialist everything was fine)

When I went to the ENT doctor for the vertigo... what a waste of time. She looked me over and told me I did not have vertigo. Which I knew already but... doctors know best right. The followup with the neurosurgeon was also frustrating. I had to wait months to see him. For him to recheck my charts, ask a few questions then refer me to a neurologist which I wont be able to see till march of 2025. 

One thing that really scares me though that I never had before this incident is the thing with my vision. Out of nowhere my eyes will go out of focus(best way i can describe what it looks like for me is when you go for an eye exam and they put it on a blurry lens) for a brief second followed by a wave of anxiety. How much anxiety it is always different. When this happens sometimes my mobility reverts back. Like 2 weeks ago it happened I had zero balance for a day, couldnt walk the way i currently walk for a week because I couldnt feel the bottom of my foot.  Another thing that really bothered me was I used to love gardening. Now for example... fall clean up something that would of been done in one day all at once, now takes several days with working on it for 15-30 min at a time after that I have to take a break because I'll feel off. shakey, some times dizzy, vision goes dark.



I know I wanted to write more and be more detailed however I forgot. If you have any questions please ask, even if its more specifics that i can pull from mychart such as the information about my spine c3-c6 . As long as I remember about this post ill read every reply. Also have you guys had any of these symptoms with your cervical stenosis? Not sure if I listed everything as so many things changed after that day and I'm slowly being accustom to it. I still have this weird feeling though of not being me if that makes sense. Also one thing that I absolutely hate is on my symptoms they only put dizziness and shortness of breath when it all started with my vision going bonkers and i told them about it numerous times and they ignored me. I feel like it is such an important detail

1h4bsyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1h4bsyg/daily_intake/,Daily intake ,"Heyy I am recovering from a restrictive ed and have posted before so won’t go into everything again but my whole mindset has changed since being on the verge of hospitalisation. Honestly I don’t even know how but I now just want to get better. Gaining weight is uncomfortable and I have bad days but I know it needs to happen. I have definitely been struggling with bloating recently and it’s only getting worse. I would say overall my diet is pretty balanced but if course I have tried to prioritise getting in those higher calorie foods to get me better quicker. Some days I eat healthier than others but today for example I will give you a rundown 
Breakfast- Avo toast on seeded bread (half an avocado across 2 slices, strawberries and 300ml of milk as an iced coffee 
Morning snack- protein vanilla yog with a dried fruit and nut mix 
Lunch- chicken, salsa and salad wrap with grapes and around 250 ml milk 
Snack-strawberry milk 
Dinner- Sunday roast (potatoes, broccoli, carrots, asparagus,turkey,stuffing and gravy) 
Pudding- large chocolate brownie from the bakery I work at and I’m not joking these brownies are pretty weighty.

I don’t track obsessively but I like to know I’ve had enough and just for context I had done a 5.5 hour shift in a cafe job this day but it was a pretty quiet day overall. Would you say this is adequate. I am 5”10 and currently 55.5kg after gaining around 6kg however need to be around 65 kg to get to where they want me. Like I say my intake does vary in terms of food but I do have a good balance of protein,fats,carbs as well as sweet treats but I would say I probably wouldn’t have the strawberry milk everyday and would usually opt for normal however it was what I fancied at the time. 
To give a little context I haven’t had a period for 2.5 years due to over exercising and undereating but have been trying hard to get it back and have been in recovery since the very end of September. I am loosing hope but know I can’t back down now. Do you think eating like this will be enough to bring my period back or am I doing something wrong ?

1h4brc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_msalexarose/comments/1h4brc9/home/,Home,"Home used to be 760, 1741, 92054. It used to be that easy to miss exit off the 5, a few blocks from the beach, with a coffee shop I could walk to. Home used to be in between the elementary school I went to as a kid and the fire station. Home was the sound of the parrots flying over in the day time, the train horn at night and occasionally the fire engine sirens. Home was filled with palm trees and always had an ocean view close by. Home had places that were mine. My favorite breakfast spot, a park I grew up in, bars that changed me and neighbors I knew and spied on. 

Home used to feel familiar. Safe even. My refuge after long weekends in Fullerton or San Diego with my friends. My calm. 

Home was the place I always came to back to. After school. After Europe. After work. After college. And After a rough breakup. Home was always there with a big garden full of flowers, a warm dinner, even if it was take out and a cat who loved me more than anything. Home was where my people were, where I could find my parents both sitting in their respective corners of the couch on any given day. Where I could run away to my brother’s house in Vistq or make the short drive to La Jolla to see my best friend. 

But after 176 days, home doesn’t feel like home anymore. 

Home feels foreign now. Like something is out of place and that something is me. Home seems older. The drawers are squeaky, the stairs creek and the light switches stick. Home feels chaotic, stressful and weirdly boring. Home is loud. Too loud. 

Home doesn’t feel comforting anymore. Home has storylines that are unfinished and cat who wants nothing to do with me. Home has a nephew who knows my name but doesn’t really seem to know I’m his only aunt. Home has parents who knew who I was, not who I am but who are desperate to connect, yet seem to knowing about me. 

Home feels exhausting. 

Being home feels sad in part because life continued. Construction finished on those new condos and people moved in. Businesses closed and new ones opened. My parents got older and are getting more forgetful. My nephew said “obachan!” at Thanksgiving and it was my mom who was grandma this time, not my grandma who passed years back. Life went on without me there to watch and it’s not that I’m mad that world didn’t stop but it feels so heavy that it didn’t. So much has changed in a few months. My nephew got older and talks now. My old bedroom is filled with things that aren’t mine. My bathroom got new tile floor. Everyone’s hair got a little more grey and the cat got fatter. 

Home feels like a past life. Like a version of me that no longer fits. Home is filled with great food and even better memories but home feels like a sweater that’s too small. Home has places I can get to without needing directions yet being here, I feel lost. Home has my family but they feel more like strangers than the people who raised me. At home, I know all the good spots but they don’t feel like mine anymore. 

I feel like a tourist at home now. I find myself wanting to do the things that tourists did that I never understood. Like buy a kitschy mug in the harbor gift shop or go in the ocean even though I know it’s too cold.  

Home feels hard to leave again yet I changed my flight to go back early because it doesn’t feel like I should stay. Home feels a little less sad to leave this time, even though I’ll cry softly to “I hate airplanes” by Alexandra Kay while my plane takes off due east. 

What used to be my home, is now a place I pack a suitcase to visit. A 3 hour plane ride, 1741 miles away from my apartment in Nashville. My quiet, clean, organized, little apartment with a bright orange couch, a cat who depends on me, plates that match and decorations that are mine. And even though this is my home according to the US postal service, my drivers license and the weather app, I’m not sure this feels like home either. It’s just where my things are right now. It’s where life took me, to grow up a little. To challenge me. To change me. It’s where I can leave the house without anyone asking where I’m going or when I’m coming back. It’s where the grocery stores and gas stations have different names but still do the same job. It’s where my story is right now. 

I’ve refused to change my home address on maps and when I see “home 1741…” I feel conflicted because no where really feels like home right now. Maybe someday it will or maybe home will feel like home again but right now both places don’t necessarily feel like mine. Rather one feels like it’s slipping through my fingertips and the other feels hard to hold onto.  ",1,1733082623.0,u_msalexarose,0,1.0,False

Hey, I hope it's ok to vent about this here. I'm having a bit of a rough time. 

So, I basically had to cut contact with my mom and stepdad. It was a huge, drawn-out thing that started because of an argument we had 2 years ago. This caused me to move out. They were saying some racist stuff and didn't like that I called them out on it. And then they gave me the silent treatment for a week, were extremely rude to a friend of mine who came to visit me, and then they said I had to apologize for their behavior. 

At the time, I did mostly just to keep the peace. But it was the emptiest apology I've ever given. I basically quit my job, went back to school, and got my current job. And then I was able to move out. During this time, they pretended like everything was fine. But I don't think I can explain the betrayal I felt. I felt like they stabbed me in the back, and it was like I was seeing them for who they really are: incredibly emotionally immature.

Anyway, they helped me with moving and setting up my new place, painting and putting lights up. But I just kept feeling so uncomfortable that they were helping me because we weren't addressing the root issue. So in March, I told them I needed some space, and they freaked out. I asked her not to contact me unless it was an emergency.

My mom sent me a spreadsheet saying I owed her money for all the stuff they did. That just absolutely broke my heart, but I gave her money for the first one. 

Fast forward to May, my grandma died. She was my dad's mom, and we were not close. I messaged my mom saying she passed. My mom didn't come to the funeral, but instead asked me if she should. She and my grandma didn't get along. So it really felt like she was putting me in the middle of their beef, and I was really annoyed. 

In July, she sent me another spreadsheet saying I owed her for the kitchen table and guest bed they said I could use. And she said I had to give her the coffee table back. This was hurtful for me because she gave it to me, and it was made by my great-grandpa. It meant a lot that she gave it to me since he died when I was 10, and it was an honor that she trusted me with a gift. So, the fact that she basically held it over my head like that was so upsetting. I started getting worried they would just come over and demand I give them all my things. Where would they draw the line? I told her I wouldn't pay her. But I did give her the table back. And I hoped she would leave me alone.

But a couple of weeks ago, she messaged me saying my grandpa (her dad) was in the hospital. He fell and broke his spine. And then the next day, he had a stroke. I didn't reply right away, and she asked, ""Was this not emergency-worthy?"" So I said, ""I hope he's ok. Sad to hear this news."" But I was upset by her tone. So I poked the bear, and I regret it. I asked her what sort of response she was looking for because I did not have any sort of connection with my grandpa. He lives out of state, and we barely saw him at all growing up. And she had mentioned that she was going to fly out to see him, so I was confused about whether I was supposed to do that too, which didn't make sense to me. It's not that I don't care about him or wish him I'll. There's just no relationship to speqk of. He is going to be ok, BTW. He is going to do physical therapy. 

She said I was self-centered, that she offered words of comfort when my grandma died (which she didn't actually). And she said I should think about how to be kinder towards the family who were there for me when I didn't reciprocate. 

And I couldn't let it go. I said, ""Maybe you should take your own advice and ask yourself how you can be kinder towards your own child.""

Because she still didn't answer my question. I can't provide any sort of emotional support or grief counseling. I'm her kid. Not her parent.

I told her I would never forgive her for the spreadsheets. That pushed me over the edge. And I said that she's not right. Literally, every single person I have talked to about this whole mess has been like, ""What the hell? That's so f'd up."" And it is.
Toxic behavior all around. But I expected better from them. I haven't actually talked to my stepdad since March, but she also tried to manipulate me with that, too. ""Oh, he thinks of you as his own daughter,"" even though I am also trans (that's a whole other story). 

It's like they have this image of me and refuse to grow with me. They refuse to understand or hear what I'm saying. They can't see that they have hurt me, and it truly is all their fault. So I deleted her number and all the texts so I don't have to look at them anymore. I didn't go to the family gathering. And good riddance. 

But it still really sucks to have to deal with this. I oscillate between feeling so proud of myself and feeling really sad and guilty. Because I don't think anyone wants to do this. But there was no other choice. Anyway, thank you for reading this. I'm hoping someone can relate. ",2,1733082340.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

so first, I only have a Switch and I don't have a way of playing on other platforms.

I recently got Sea of Stars, and I enjoy the story but even on the easiest setting I just can't handle the combat, my anxiety doesn't do well with that. I'm currently on Moonlighter and that's borderline too hard. I need something embarrassingly easy _if_ there is combat.

I also don't enjoy anything that involves farming/farming like mechanics like SDV, the My Time series, or Spirittea which I wanted to love but I got tired of the time/stamina mechanic.

I enjoy story driven games, I'm happy with puzzles but nothing that requires precise timing like jump n run games.

Recent games I enjoyed are the Coffee Talk, Dredge in passive mode, A Space for the Unbound, Carto, Alba, Minute Island, Tinykin, Beacon Pines, The Gardens Between, or Death and Taxes, but also games like Natsu Mon, which involves a lot of completing collections. I've played the 'classics' like ACNH, A Short Hike, the Zeldas (but just for the exploring and collecting), Oxenfree I & II, etc.

I'm looking at Eastward but I'm not sure if the combat involved would be suitable someone like me. If you have any other game recs you think I might enjoy, maybe some less well known games that I wouldn't find on the top hit lists, I would be very grateful!

1h4bh71,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1h4bh71/detailed_review_of_first_family_cruise_oasis/,Detailed Review of First Family Cruise (Oasis),"My father passed away in February.  I decided to use some of the money I got from the sale of his house on a family vacation.

I thought it would be fun for our entire family to take a cruise over Thanksgiving week. (Our three kids are all in college and I'm a teacher, so that was the best way to coordinate everyone's schedules. If you have older kids, you know it's almost impossible to get the entire family in one room at the same time, let alone for several days. Plus neither my husband nor I have any living parents anymore, so in a weird way it felt appropriate to *not* be home for Thanksgiving.)

Honestly, the kids were not too keen on the idea. They thought it would be boring. Two of them said they'd rather go to Yellowstone. But Yellowstone appeared to be closed in late November, and I didn't think we could afford for five people to fly out there anyway.

Also, one of the reasons I thought a cruise would make a good family vacation was that we could be  together, yet independent. There wouldn't be five people arguing about where to have dinner, or people getting frustrated because So-and-So slept late and now we're running behind schedule, etc etc.

**Itinerary**

6 day cruise with stops in CocoCay, Falmouth (Jamaica) and Labadee (Haiti)

**Food/Drink**

I was curious what we'd think of the food, since after we booked the trip I saw so many posts saying that the food was awful.

We liked the food quite a bit. **My son said that dinner in the MDR was one of his favorite parts of the trip**. A few of us got two appetizers and two desserts at every meal. We enjoyed getting the Cheese Plate dessert as an appetizer a few times.

One of my daughters really liked WJ and chose to eat there instead two evenings. (One of those nights she still joined us at MDR and knitted a sweater.)

I had a salad almost every day for lunch at **Park Cafe** and also really liked their bagel sandwiches and muesli/overnight oats for breakfast.

I only went to WJ once. Generally speaking, I don't really like buffets. I went at 11:15am, thinking everyone probably finished breakfast by then and the place would have cleared out. WRONG!! I was lucky I could find a seat.

We had zero desire to try the speciality restaurants. There was no need to; there was plenty of good food without having to pay extra.

**We did not get the drinking package**, partly because we're not big drinkers (I'm definitely not!) and partly because one of my children is a recovering addict and it would have triggered her if we were drinking constantly during the trip.

**Rude Adults/Annoying Kids**

This is something else that I saw a lot of posts about. Thankfully, this wasn't an issue except for once. When we sailing out of CocoCay, there was a boy who was maybe 8 or 9 in the balcony next to ours. He was screaming goodbye to the ship really loudly (in an obnoxious way, not just being excited) and spitting repeatedly over the railing really loudly, and screaming that he was spitting really loudly. I kept waiting for a parent to tell him to not scream like that, but that never happened.

Fortunately that was the only time we had to deal with him. And I didn't notice anyone else being rude or annoying.

**I do wish we'd brought more ducks**. It was fun to see kids running around trying to find them.

One thing that did surprise me was that people weren't very ... friendly? I guess I'd heard before of people making friends on a cruise. Very few people even made eye contact, let alone struck up a conversation at any point.

Not a big deal, but it did surprise me. I've been to Disney World, and when I go there, I'm always chatting with families in line, giving traders pins to kids, etc. I thought a cruise would have a similar vibe, and it definitely didn't.

We thought the service from the crew members was excellent.

**Clothes/Packing**

I thought I did a pretty good packing, if I do say so myself. :)

I brought three summer jumpsuits and two sundresses. That's what I wore to dinner every night (I didn't follow the themes), and also most of the time when I wasn't in gym clothes or a bathing suit. I also packed a pair of denim shorts and a nice-ish shirt (meaning not a t-shirt). Regular sandals, pool sandals, and water shoes for the excursion. The (not expensive) jewelry I wore onboard.

We bought metal hooks and were glad that we had them. I also bought Thanksgiving magnets for the doors. It was fun, but now I wish I could give them to someone else, because I doubt we'll ever take a Thanksgiving cruise again any time soon.

**Excursions/Ports**

I was smart enough to go to CocoCay at 9am, leave just before noon, and then go back at around 2pm. That way we missed the crowds.

I ate a chicken sandwich and mozzarella sticks at the Snack Shack at South Beach and immediately regretted it. The buffet at Chill Grill looked decent, though.

There was a nice nature trail and a remote part of the beach just past South Beach. My husband liked that a lot.

**By far our favorite part of the entire vacation was Dunn River Falls in Falmouth**. We booked it through Peat Taylor Tours and were very pleased. We also went to Blue Hole, which was not quite as fun (I think by then some of us were a little tired of the water), but I did enjoy jumping off the cliffs into the water there.

Labadee was pretty much a waste, I'm sorry to say. One of my daughters and I hung out at the beach for a little while, walked around, split a cocktail, took the tram to another beach where we told we couldn't be there because it cost extra, then went back to the ship. My other family members didn't even do that much.

We briefly considered doing the zipline or coaster, but it didn't seem worth it for the price.

**Ship Activities**

Like I said earlier, my kids didn't love the idea of taking a cruise from the beginning, saying that it would be boring.

I thought, ""No, there's so much to do, they'll be pleasantly surprised!""

Well ...

They were bored.

One of my daughters and I went to the pool briefly and rode a water slide on the first day, and that' the only time any of us went to the pool. I was disappointed by how small and crowded the pools were, and the noise was just too much for me.

Both my daughters went to **trivia** with me a few times. It was fun. Not amazing, but fun. Again, it was very crowded. We had to sit on the floor each time.

My son and husband enjoyed playing **ping-pong**.

We went to the **Aqua Show**, but unfortunately it was cut short due to ""technical difficulties."" I would have gone to see Cats if anyone else was interested (and if we could've gotten in), but they weren't.

We paid to do the **Apollo 18 Escape Room**. Personally, I didn't like it at all. First of all, I think I think I'm just too dumb for Escape Rooms. But I've been to other Escape Rooms that I liked better than this one.

This was one was very math-heavy. We had to analyze of bunch of graphed curves in one part, and had to solve a bunch of equations in another. Not really my idea of fun. At the end, the guy told us that only about half the groups are able to solve it. I would have enjoyed something more solve-able.

I went to a **Morning Stretch Class** in the gym a few times, and really enjoyed it. On the last day, my daughter and I planned to go to an afternoon Yoga Class. But when we got there, we were told it was just for people who paid extra. That kind of put me off. My daughter also went to the gym and did weights a few times by herself.

**Favorite Hangouts**

Honestly, my favorite thing to do on the ship was just to hang out, often by myself. I read two entire (albeit short) books on the trip. (Yay Kindle!) I also spent a fair amount of time crocheting.

**My favorite spots were Central Park (where I also enjoyed the live music) and the back of the boat on Deck 5 where the jogging track is.** One night I sat out there for an hour and watched the sunset, which was very nice.

We got **two rooms with a balcony** (mostly because my husband gets motion sick easily) and were glad we did. My husband enjoyed having his coffee out there in the morning. One evening I sat out there after dark and read for about an hour. It also made the whole room feel more open and peaceful than if we were just surrounded by walls.

**Our Mistakes**

For the most part, I felt like we made choices (thanks to this sub).

However, there are two main mistakes we made:

**1) Not booking everything earlier.**

I had heard somewhere that you should book excursions and shows and things before you got on the boat. I thought to myself, ""Oh, I'll book them extra early -- like a month before!""

Buy by then almost everything was already sold out. I didn't expect that at all.

**2) Not having enough cash.**

Since we wouldn't be drinking, I didn't think we would need much cash. We had one excursion, and it didn't occur to me until we were on the ship that we'd have to tip our guide.

Well, I didn't realize that we would have ***three*** guides -- a driver, one guide at Dunn River Falls, and another guide at Blue Hole.

So we ran out of cash before we could tip the driver, which led us to having to go to the ATM, having problems with our code, being frantic that we were going to miss the boat ... it was stressful.

Fortunately, we finally ended up getting cash at one of the markets, and we did ***not*** get left behind in Jamaica. But I would not recommend doing it that way.

**Overall Thoughts**

In retrospect, a part of me wishes we'd booked a shorter cruise. My kids really didn't like the fact that the cruise (including driving to and from the port) took up their entire Thanksgiving break.

But for me, it was just the right length.

***We won't be cruising again as a family any time soon, that's for sure.***

Some of my kids' objections to cruising were: It's too ""fake""; they'd rather stay in a country for longer than a few hours; it's annoying how so many things cost extra.

My son made an interesting comment: ***""It feels the whole idea of a cruise is people are paying a lot of money just so they can feel rich.""***

I could picture my husband and I ***possibly*** taking a cruise again sometime, just the two of us.

But if we did, I think I'd prefer to go somewhere like Europe, where I could actually experience some different countries and culture. I enjoyed CocoCay, but it was basically just an extension of the ship, and like I said earlier, Labadee wasn't very interesting at all.

Well, I think I covered just about everything. If you have any questions for me, I'd be happy to answer them!",1,1733081918.0,royalcaribbean,0,0.67,False

I'm Jim and I'm a pranic practitioner from Manchester, a medium and a geek. I'm brilliant with energy work and can turn my prana up and down at the drop of a hat, and am good with training people (I've done this online, results every time but from the perspective of safety, easy settling and making sure people can go about their day).

I'm very respectful, and have a lot to do with spirits, have had some incredible experiences, and have developed chi practice with healing and technology, in very easy ways. I'm looking to develop this, for fun and to share what I've learnt, and have combined things with a very simple magic practice - I love pranic healing because of what it says on one page in Miracles Through Pranic healing, a rare 'permitted to use intention' -

I can heal all of these within minutes or seconds myself, and am aware of some results being better with scant attention over time -

Broken capillaries, wrinkles, crows feet, drooping eyelids  
Trapped nerves, mild burns (without a trace), eyesight  
Aches, sprains and torn tendons  
Teeth

I use the pranic healing/hands of light method and my own chi, and those with spirits if they're around. I can change prana forms to gas, a stream and a gel, which I can lay onto things and, as I've read the pranic healing book, I'm aware of the subtlety and beauty of intention. I can sense energy too and help you to, but it's the sweeping cleansing of pranic healing that's most intriguing, because of how it can make us aware of fields - I can lift and intention them at will with remarkable results. Get the light right and I can make it so you can see the gas like that in the air coming from my palms, and little tunnel-sausages of chi like denser air, and I'm well aware of what it is... space-time, and of course it can make little light streaks and little cones of light and or dark that pop - never pour energy into a chakra for this reason, it's a space-time bubble that pops -

That, a bit of taijai knowledge knowledge, spiritual respect and an awareness of how to grey a line, with being able to control fields has led to me working with my PC... I can tap a word at the screen, the displays hum and a cleansing and healing comes from the screen - and it works :)

On a home PC... a bit of work and we can make real holograms, and with the right kind of video I can show you spatial distortions on the screens, that move where you look. It's to do with fields and energy and energising :)  


There's loads we can do with this, and I'd love to have coffees, host them and have nice people come around to share info and see what I've got. I need nice people because I work with spirits and some of them are children, and my space is developed so that I can still smoke and relax without harming them, so I've worked really hard - but my experience with being a medium has led to me meeting my own spirit Buddy-self in the bathroom mirror, where the mirror bulged and the ripple spread off the glass - I can make things do that with my hands :)



It's not just space, it's time and my spirits have taught me what it's about, how it was and is made, and I can do it and feel it, and make it visible. Listening to Agnes is like nothing you've experienced in this room here... Make the air like silk and butter to music, or draw in a field so we smile and say 'that smells like Reiki' and know what it means :)

Once, we had a get-together party and went to a restaurant. While eating, we talked about the food, and everyone agreed that it wasn’t good. The next day, during a coffee break, I brought up the topic again and joked about how bad the food was. I also made fun of the girl who had chosen the restaurant. At the time, I believed she wasn’t taking it seriously.

However, when we were leaving, another friend scolded me for bringing up the topic again and for making fun of her.

Can someone tell me if what I did was wrong? If it was, Igive some advice on how to talk to girls. Is this kind of joking okay, or should I change the way I speak?",1,1733081405.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now.

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with.

For years my GF and I laughed at ourselves for giving every little critter we meet a name and a back story and got invested in their little lives. And often joked how if only people we knew could see us 😂

Then I found this group and discovered we’re thankfully one of many who took joy from seeing our 8 legged little friends.

It’s a sign of a good person when they have love for all creatures great and small so any one reading this give yourselves a nod of self appreciation YOU ARE GREAT! 🙌🏻

Anyway as for the little guy in the picture.

I was working away from home and getting some fresh air and a coffee outside the hotel, when I this guy came trundling over. 

He literally made a bee line for me from metres away and stopped short by a foot. I said hello, then stepped out of the way incase he was on urgent business and I was blocking his path. But when I stepped to the side he just turned to face me again, this happened 3 times before I thought to get a pic, which he gladly posed for. 

Felt like he may have been trying to tell me something, but he was chill so I like to think it was an emergency. I waiting a little while but had to go so bid him a pleasant evening and farewell.

1h4b8mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1h4b8mi/thanksgiving_was_5_months_seperated/,Thanksgiving was 5 months seperated,"Thanksgiving marked 5 months since I got our toddler & I away from Q. Before we left Q was starting cessation therapy for severe AUD. Q was verbally abusive for far too long & they got physical with me & I had to get us out. We are a few hrs away & have visited 4 times as recent as right now for our 'turkey day'. Q claims 3 months & change maybe 4 months by now sober. I did the dishes today & it was the first time I smelled coffee in the travel mug & not fruity malt liquor. 

Q claims she cannot forgive me for leaving, not owning up to abuse, lots of anger & shit communication. Q wants me to move back and stay in separate room until i can find my own place. my support system is a few hrs away & I have grown sour of our high cost of living area. Honestly, it sounds like a terrible existence moving back in & having to find employment around Q's busy schedule. Sounds like im setting myself up to be evicted by landlord like Q has used in past on ex. 

We have been together for 5-6 years, never hitched and child is 4 give take 6 months. Alcohol has been there the whole time. I have not been perfect; I want us to be a unit. I do not want to be a unit with abusive ppl.

Q will not agree to be decent around child nor advocate for me in front of Q's family. I have not heard her spit evil, but Q is away with child now. I came because i don't want them to miss out on holiday memories & also don't want to pull the pin on a custody battle. 

The grannies at my meeting tell me to wait a year before making a big decision. I would love for Q to get adjusted to the meds & realize the error of her ways, but i realize that may never happen. Any tips for taking a bite out of this shit sandwich situation?

SERVICE & TRANSITIONS -- 👎 poor  
Pleasant check-in: swift, professional, & thorough-- Tap pay also supported (great for those resorts fees)!  
The personalities felt ""put on"" & insincere. Interacting w/daytime employees was fantastically painful undesirable & ineffective.  
Operations suffered significantly when it came to communication, whether requesting service or basic information. Employees did not take feedback gracefully.  
Spiteful housekeeping staff; categorically denied service for 5 days.... sick & twisted behavior.  
The walk to our room was scenic but also exhausting after a long drive due to the flight of stairs for an upper unit. ⚠️ no bell service for heavy items.  
Signage could use a facelift, especially for check-in's after sundown.  
MVP employees: Nathan  

ROOM \[[Oversized Garden View Suite](https://youtu.be/8ealtxLL62o), [Grand Marina Suite](https://youtu.be/DKHVVW3PT6M)\] -- 👍 ok  
A modern Hawaii-inspired big-island-timeshare vibe. Clean & calming. Website photos weren't flattering or informing but their descriptions were true to form; dimensions felt definitively OVERSIZED. This level of spaciousness was exceptionally refreshing. Indoor lighting was somehow a lot and a little... notably dim & gloomy during overcast. The balcony offered no reprieve as ""garden view"" equated to ""obstructed by palm trees & bird poop"". Bummer. The lack of bird spikes/deterrents + the irregular cleaning intervals  exemplified a tier of low-effort.  
The oversized Marina suite was uninspired & not worth the upsell. It's identical to the Oversized Queen, but features more empty common area space.  
⚠️  Housekeeping will not service rooms occupied by guests; a daft & quite inconvenient policy. At worst it's disingenuous considering the safe (14"" x 1.5"" x 16"") is just large enough for a single unopened laptop. Turnover is also performed with doors wide-open, on multiple rooms at once. Ripe conditions for something to ""go missing"".  

BED \[Queen\] -- 👍 good  
A supportive Serta hospitality mattress that provided quality sleep.  
There's still much to be desired from this setup due to the inconsistent pillow fill, undersized bedding, & makeshift duvet situation. Sheet quality was just ""ok"", but everything was clean, so good enough.  
The bed-side utility was a standout: multiple outlets + USB ports galore & reading lights in some configurations.  
Queen-sized sofa sleeper included in suites.  

BATH -- 👍 ok  
A medium-sized bathroom, lukewarm on design & function.  
Toilet height was uncomfortable (low) & other installations had odd quirks. Not to mention the chipped tub...  
Despite cosmetic woes, the shower experience was fine. Water pressure & towel quality were satisfactory but those Nectar bath products stole the show -- so aromatic & moisturizing with a great lather, dispensed from hassle-free squeeze bottles. Amazing ❤️.  
⚠️ Aside from the bath products, no toiletries were present in any configuration so pack mindfully.  
They're inconsistent on stocking rooms w/bathrobes but it's worth procuring; airy & lightweight w/a 60-40 blend perfect for the microclimate.  

TV SOLUTION/ACTIVITIES -- 👎 ok  
2x 55"" UHD LG Hospitality TV's -- a gorgeous display for 4k content.   
Ports were easily accessible & there were multiple streaming integrations incl. Netflix, Amazon Prime, & Showtime.  Combined with the Local programming + on-demand DirectTV, it was a formidable entertainment center. It wasn't as optimized for quality/UX: constant buffering, sluggish UI navigation, & ads galore 😵‍💫💫🐤.  
A large pool & jacuzzi were steps away from our door; pros & cons (noise) to this but overall the easy access is satisfying for patio units. Hours were also generous hours (6-11).  
‼️ there's wayyy too much chlorine used in the jacuzzi. ‼️  
The fitness center is more of a 'personal gym' due to the size. Readily felt cramped with just 3 guests & was always occupied.  

WI-FI & CELL RECEPTION -- 👍 ok  
AT&T speed was frustratingly slow & the reception was weak. Verizon service was slightly more performant though. Dead zones in various spots within the room.  
Free Unencrypted WiFi was serviceable albeit mediocre for streaming. Not recommend for the over-employed.  
\--Performance--  
Video streaming - average  
Online gaming - average  
Video chatting - average  
\--Nerd Stats--  
15-19 Mbps download  
14-20 Mbps upload  
0% packet loss  
11 ms latency  
12 ms jitter

FOOD & DRINK -- 👎 ok  
DoorDash friendly.  
Beverages & junk food were available for purchase in the lobby (wine, instant noodles, energy drinks, etc).  
The restaurant was too much of a hassle to deal with. Their Thanksgiving buffet was a thoughtful offering with a robust menu. Sadly, the coordination & management was severely lacking. They're insufficiently equipped to converse on dietary restrictions or intents, & it's impossible to obtain nutrition info. The out-of-date webpages, lack of allergen information, & counterintuitive use of QR codes (latest menu on OpenTable FYI) was so frustrating.  
The kitchenette, thankfully, was fantastic -- clean & fully equipped, with an inviting design. Great for hosting guests or cooking for a big family.  
in-room:  
✅ microwave (mini)  
✅ fridge (full)  
✅ coffee/tea  
❌ wet-bar  
❌ mini-bar

NOISE -- 👎 bad  
Awful acoustics...  Amenities are open late (11pm) & there are quiet hours (9pm) posted. Nevertheless, the murders (🐦‍⬛) , squabbling squadrons, & kid-screams, made it difficult to relax.  
Noise from adjacent units wasn't a problem, but be prepared to eavesdrop/overhear awkward conversations from patios below.

LOCATION -- 👍 great  
A safe, scenic, and serene property.  
We were surrounded by lush green growth & beautiful bodies of water. There's a multitude of wild life visible throughout the property, everything from Koi & turtles to ducks and macaws.  
Gated parking (no EV charging) was available on-site + plenty of surveillance for added peace of mind.

RECOMMENDATION  
Final Price: $266.58/night  
Was it worth it? no  
Best part: location  
Accommodations were memorable for their huge dimensions & the property was beautiful-- Terrific eye-candy!  
Yet, it all but falls apart under any scrutiny: this stay was MUCH noisier than we could've anticipated (quiet hours aren't enforced), food staff were poorly trained, & it was impossible to obtain accurate info for important things, like food allergies or for mundane services (i.e. housekeeping).  
For whatever reason it continues to be a popular destination for families & older guests.  Personally, I can't see myself returning nor would I recommend this business.

I see the Nespresso machines at European car dealers and various European themed shopping spots.  I also see Nespresso a lot in Europe, I am assuming due to Nescafe being so dominant over there.

Keurig seems to dominate Starbucks and various retailers in the USA.  Dolce Gusto used to seem like the best option to me for premium ""pod"" coffee but today, seems to be poorly supported in general.  Nespresso capsules seem to be rather marked up so, I question the business ethics with that option but, with self-fill capsules that avoid the proprietary aspects of the newer machines might be a supporting option.

So:

* Keruig
* Nespresso
* Dolce Gusto

**Which would you get or recommend and why?**

  
For background, my Mom was a dedicated Keruig user which various cheap machines over time.  Coffee at her house was Okay but, not spectacular.  I used to run an awesome Espresso machine at home with Lilly coffee but, it was lost in a household move ... 😢).  Pour over, French press, and Aeropress are something I have occasionally at home today.  I do Cowboy coffee camping using a cheap hand grinder to put grinds in a cup with some hot water which is actually pretty good on a cold morning away from civilization.",1,1733081087.0,coffeestations,1,1.0,False

For our anniversary I've sent him like 14 items in a box (muesli, handmade beanie, coffee etc etc etc) and he will open it tomorrow, so that'll cheer him up. But abhi philhaal kya Karu? First wave chala Gaya hai placements ka and he hasn't gotten placed. He's very worried par dikha nahi Raha.

Described by trumpeter and Count Basie Orchestra director Scotty Barnhart as “in the top 1% of bassists worldwide,” the acclaimed bassist and former SFJAZZ High School All-Stars member Mikailo Kasha honors bass legend Ray Brown and his 2001 Telarc trio album Live at Starbucks.A pioneering musician who was foundational to the development of bebop, Ray Brown is best known for his work with Oscar Peterson’s iconic trio and with Ella Fitzgerald in addition to his later career as a bandleader over his six decades in music.He had lengthy associations with Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter, Barney Kessel, and the L.A. Four, and released dozens of albums under his own name.In the late 1980s, Brown began a fruitful relationship with Telarc Records that saw the release of 21 albums over 24 years including his 2001 live trio date Live at Starbucks, recorded over two days in September of 1999 at a famous location of the coffee chain at 23rd and Jackson Streets in Seattle. oined by pianist Geoffrey Keezer and drummer Karriem Riggins, Brown brings a bone-deep command and youthful energy to the Duke Ellington compositions “Mainstem,” “Love You Madly,” and “Caravan,” in addition to material by Lester Young, Tad Dameron, Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello, and three originals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I went to ask them if they'd like to order any coffees or sweets, and after I took their order I informed them that we would be closing in about 30 minutes, as i didnt want to bring them their coffees and then tell them as it would give them less time to finish their coffees, pay at the till, etc. We try to inform customers about 30 minutes before closing as the closing process is quite lengthy and we can't actually start until there's no more customers in the building. We also stop getting paid 15 mins after closing time but obviously im not going to tell customers that lol. This was how the conversation went:

Me: ""No problem, I'll get those started now, also just letting you know we will be closing in about 30 minutes""

Customer: ""Oh do you want us to come and pay you now? We don't have to get coffees if you're closing soon""

Me: ""No no, you're fine, just pay at the till whenever you're all finished. I just thought i'd let you know sooner than later. It takes a while to close you see so we try to let customers know so we can all get out a decent time""

Customer: ""No, you know what we'll go somewhere else. We don't be somewhere where the staff don't want us""

Then they cancelled the order, the guys wife paid up and they all left. Mind you they had already been sitting there for nearly 2 and a half hours, it was 3:30pm on a Sunday, and there's literally no where else open in my town at that time which I did tell them when he said he wanted to go somewhere else but the guy didn't want a bar of it - he was also the only one that really seemed to have a problem with it as the others were sort of telling him it's fine.

What I want to know is - am I a dick for that? Could have I worded it differently? Was I being too honest? The customer service in me leaves my body the closer we get to closing time.",30,1733080820.0,TalesFromYourServer,21,0.94,False

I moved the existing end tables to flank the entertainment center (my husband hand built all of them) but the current matching coffee table is a huge rectangle and I don’t like it in this space. 

Would love to hear some recommendations - the alternate plan is to swap this for the couch I did order (same sectional in a different configuration that would sit parallel to the TV in a more traditional L shape).

I have a kidney condition so I drink lots of water, and I also just grew up in a household that drank water. We would have sodas with meals or whatever, but usually people drank water or iced tea.

I have never seen my girlfriend take a sip of water. When we first started dating, I didn't really think about it, because we're having dinner or at the movies or whatever. She would comment on me always having water as if she found it strange, but again I didn't really think about it. 

Now, we're living together, and I find her hydration habits a little alarming. As I said, she refuses to drink any water whatsoever. She drinks dark sodas mostly, some energy drinks, sugary coffee drinks, and cocktails. The whole reason I thought to make this post is because she has COVID right now, and she practically screamed at me when I tried to push her to drink water and hydrate. I don't even bring it up with her, I don't watershame or try to get her to change, but in this case her health is at risk so I gave a little pushback. I finally got her to drink some Gatorade, but she had two Diet Cokes right after.

She is otherwise a very reasonable, intelligent girl. Outwardly healthy, though who knows what all that junk and dehydration is doing to her insides. It feels like such a stupid thing to even talk about, but am I crazy for finding it very unappealing? Who hates water? It's literally tasteless.

---------------------

“Rook?”

I had entered the dinner room without thinking, Lucanis stood in our made-up kitchenette. I had not thought it would be his turn to cook or to already do so. However, I barely keep up with the time nowadays, too much on my mind. He looked damn cute with the apron tied around his hips. His sleeves rolled up till his elbows. It was… distracting. He was distracting. I should not react, like Viago taught me. The only thing I did was look up, and I said nothing. My heart made a jump. 

Wow. That was the first word that I said when I found Lucanis Dellamorte in Ossuary. I had heard his name as a fellow Crow. But I never met the grandson of the first talon. He was very handsome and a very bad idea. But I needed people against Elgar’nan and Ghilan’nain, so naturally, I was not going to complain. This man only became a much worse idea when he went to buy gifts for the others. Good god, could he be handsome and a great personality both at the same time? My heart would never win. Fresh herbs for Lace her place. Fruit for Neve. Fish for Bellara. My Crow heart found a dagger and bought it for him. How I accidentally found him the perfect gift when we only recently met? Don’t ask me. He bought me coffee, told me it was like a kiss goodbye and all I thought was: I want a welcome kiss. Welcome home in Treviso, in the lighthouse, everywhere as long as he would be the one to give it to me. This was getting ridiculous. 

To say that after coffee at Cafe Pietra, I would keep my distance. That was a lie. I was drawn to this man. He was a master assassin. He loved the same city as I did. He could cook. He was funny and just… a whole list of other things. 

“Rook?”

Right. Kitchen. “L-Lucanis?” Get your head back out of the clouds. Why was I in the kitchen again? Where were the others? I should probably go. Maybe I stared too long at him, I could see he was getting uncomfortable. I don’t think it was Spite, so it must be me. “I already started preparing dinner. I, eh, made a pie. You eh, you think that ehm, Neve likes gooseberry pie?” 

Neve. Neve Gallus. Perfect Neve Gallus. Of course. Of bloody freaking course. It was always Neve. She disappeared when Minrathous needed her and returned. She was everywhere. Always the one with ideas, suggestions, or a word that commented on my ideas or stuff. I was not made for this, I needed Varric to tell me that I could do this. But she was obviously meant for this. She always knew what to say, where the problems lay, and so on. Everyone liked her. And this man! This bloody gorgeous man liked her too much. 

While my mind went on about Neve Gallus, my body turned around. I don’t even remember which way the door went. Did I need to push or pull? Maybe it was the fade, and it simply swung open the way you needed it to be. I tried not to run, I really did. I tried to make it look like I was done in that room and on my way to Lace. Only to dart right past her bridge and run up the stairs and hide behind the statue of Mythal or who it had to represent. No crying was allowed. I simply needed a breather. Assassins, Crows, would not show this weakness. Would not let their emotions take them over. If I did my contract as it should; Viago would scowl at me for this. But then again, I would point out Teia to him, and he would scoff and just say nothing. 

“Rook?” 

I felt my shoulders move up as I got the jumpscare of my life. How was a dwarf on wooden shoes so quiet!? 

“Lace?”
“Are you alright?”
“Sure.”
“Then why are you hiding?”
“I am not. I am eh, you know, trying to find a place to relax.” 

She looked at me rather skeptically, and who was I kidding. “You want to talk about it?” Is what she asked, but I shook my head. She knew, ""I bet she did, Lace Harding was not only a scout of the environment but also about people's feelings."" 

“He made Neve pie.” 

The smaller woman dropped down next to me on the ground. “Oh.” Yea, there were no words for the situation. He was easy for her to decipher. Lucanis was always near the kitchen. Lived in the damn pantry after all. And making a pie for one person, well. Was it not enough to torture myself about it again and again? How many times have I repeated his voice in my head saying the words I made Neve gooseberry pie. He did not say that, but it was what he meant. 

As if being busted by Lace was not enough, Bellara showed up and hugged me. Did the whole Lighthouse know what happened? Did the Fade write it on everyone's door like it was the morning paper? It only got worse when I heard Neve her footsteps. 

“Rook?”

I made a scoffing sound as a reply. Maybe I hung out too much with Viago before. “I can explain.” I did not need her explanation on how they fell in love over the disaster that happened to both Minrathous and Treviso. I did not need for her to hear that they both loved coffee, even if she boiled her coffee beans! Or how they kept meeting in the middle of the night. Bellara gave me a nudge, and Lace helped me up. I don’t know if they knew exactly what happened, but I just stood there, and Neve took my hand and guided me away from the other girls. I did not want to come, but too heartbroken. I just let everyone carry me. What a Crow I was. In front of the kitchen building, she stopped and turned to me with her hands on her hips. 

“I gave him some tips on flirting as apparently not all Crows had that lesson. He made pie as a thank you.” 

Neve stopped talking and looked at me. “Maybe you should let him tell you something more.” 
I wanted to refuse, I did not need any more words. But she stopped here to push me inside. The fade door swinging the other way open now. The traitor! Lucanis stood there as if mere seconds had only passed. As if I have not left him there. The only difference was that he was looking at the tiles instead of me. Until I entered the room further. 

“Rook, let me try again. I made dinner preparations. But I made you hazelnut torte, Emmrich told me that it fits perfectly with your favourite coffee blend.”

1h4anen,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h4anen/basket_size_ecm_puristika/,Basket Size - ECM Puristika,"Hello everyone,

Not too long ago, I purchased an ECM Puristika as my first machine, which I've managed to figure out and make some decent coffee with. After some research here, I also invested in a kingrinder k4 which has been going great.

It's unclear to me what the basket sizes are that come with the machine.. I know grams are not a perfect guide, as it depends on the beans, but I'd find it helpful to have an approximate figure.

The internet didn't help me, nor re-re-re-re-reading the manual, so I come here to ask the pros. The manual just says use the smaller basket for single, and the bigger basket for doubles (the portafilter has a double spout).

When I make a single espresso, 7g doesn't seem anywhere enough. I've been using 12g, which comes out good, and seems to be about the right amount, but I could probably pack a bit more in there if I wanted.

For the double basket, I have been putting 18g, which seems to be about the right amount, comes out good, but I could probably put a bit less if I wanted.

My question is, shouldn't they have some relation to eachother? Or am I missing some kind of standard here?

If single = 12g, shouldn't double be 24g?

But if 24g is too much, and so I make a double with 18g, shouldn't I make a single with 9g? Which isn't enough... 

As an aside question, the single basket has curved sides and always seems to have coffee stuck to it after I remove the puck, no matter what I do - is this to be expected with this type of basket? The double basket has straight edges and if I make a good extraction, the puck comes out solid and leaves the basket practically clean.

Budget is flexible but not sure if there's a point in spending more.

1h4ai7u,https://i.redd.it/9kfbxep0ba4e1.jpeg,Finally drove one,"I’ve been on this Reddit page for a couple months now, as I research my next car purchase. I’m basically looking for a 3rd car that will be my toy for occasional driving in the Rocky Mountains and going to car meets like Cars and Coffee.  I still have a list of vehicles that I’m considering but I finally drove the GR86 yesterday.  First off, this blue is gorgeous! If I buy an 86, this or the Hakone Edition’s green are my top two choices.  The only downside to this specific car was that it doesn’t have the performance package. However, this one was a manual. I call it a Gen X special 🤪

I haven’t owned a manual since my ‘99 new Beetle but I found that this cars clutch is very forgiving. I’m making my wife take driving lessons to learn how to drive a manual and I think she would have an easy time with the 86.  I really found it to be very enjoyable.  

We headed up into the foothills of the Rockies and one big difference between this car and the Miata is the power band. IMO that power band not only helps make gear selection more forgiving, but it also lets the 86 charge up steep grades. I’ve found that the Miata can have some sluggishness in that regard. Of course, we got to carve up some mountain curves as well amd here again, to no one’s surprise, the 86 just shines. I haven’t drifted a car in over a decade, and I didn’t do it this time either, but boy it was tempting. Also, very surprisingly to me, the ride was pretty dang good for a sports car with as little sidewall as this one had.  I don’t think my wife or I would mind a long road trip in this.

Some other things of note. 
I’m 6’2” / 195lbs and easily fit into the drivers seat. I pulled the seat up, maybe an inch and lowered it as far as it could go. I had maybe 3” of headroom to spare. I did have to raise the steering wheel all the way up in order to insure my knees did hit it when doing any clutch work, but things worked out quite well.  The interior is tight, but not claustrophobic. Again, it was a comfortable place to be.  The only downside, IMO, are the ridiculous cup holders in the center console. I really want an option to remove them so I can use that storage space. The ciphers in the doors are acceptable. Also, I would love an option (or mod) to cleanly remove the back seat. It’s more pointless than those in a Porsche 911.  

So, end result is that the GR86 remains solidly in my shopping list while the legendary Miata is off.  The biggest reason for me taking the MX5 off my list is due to the cabin size for my body type. I can fit into it, but with the GR, I can fit and be comfortable. 

Next up, I need to drive the Nissan Z, a used Porsche 918 Cayman, a Supra 2.0/3.0, and a Mustang.

The 86 has a real advantage it being more affordable than most of these while still having a lot fun built into its package. That lower price also gives me more options for mods.  My wife insists I drive all of them before making a decisions (I know, like twist my arm) IMO, the Supra 3.0 is very desirable but its pricing is a bit ridiculous. This same dealer has a 2023 with 4k miles on it for $59K. I’m not sure I’ll care about the 2.0 version. The Z is very intriguing to me as prices for them have been on the decline. I’m now setting up to $6K off both the Sport and Performance trims in my area.  The Mustang GT, well you know the deal there. Power and responsibility to not drive yourself into a Cars abs Coffee crowd. I’ve owned one other Mustang, an 06 GT and it was one of my favorite cars. So there’s that. 

One last option is to save up and buy a C8 Vette. I may consider a C7 as well. 

Oh, one other thing. This dealer does have a Hakone edition inbound. No one has claimed it and they are promising that there will be no markups. I really want to see one in person before putting a deposit down, but I do love it from the photos and videos I’ve seen.  ",23,1733079468.0,GR86,5,1.0,False

- what window treatments do you recommend?
- does the couch need to come out a little more from the windows?

- The carpet will be gone eventually
- The paint will be a warm white / cream sometime in the next 6 months
- We want to access the door well for better indoor/outdoor flow. It has been underutilized in the past.
- The fireplace facade will go all matte black to diminish the gold. I’m too afraid to touch the brick right now although it’s definitely not my favorite color of brick.
- Art is a whole house project but this room is hard because of the intense sunlight. Hence the mirror, which replaced a very faded poster. Recommendations for high sunlight rooms welcome. Maybe we just go sculpture vs paintings/photos.

**Memory transcription subject:** **_Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: November 2, 2136_

_Stay calm, this is a peaceful meeting._

I repeated the fact inside my head as we entered the gargantuan hangar of the _Nemesis_. Despite it, everything about this vessel radiated menace. I had seen the pictures and videos, but it barely put into perspective just how massive this ship was: I could really only compare its size to the Sivkit's massive colony-ships, rather than anything conventional.

_And unlike those colony-ships, this was clearly a vessel built for war._

To put that all together in my head was rather unsettling in its own; to then add that the artificial intelligence in control had an inexplicable distrust and prejudice towards us? Coming here felt like a _fatal mistake._ But...we needed to get to the bottom of this. Elias Meier had promised that a brief would help clear things up with the AI, 'Red One', and possibly lead to better relations. I would have to set aside my anxieties if the Venlil were to live through the oncoming war we were now entangled in.

So, I steadied my heartbeat, and stilled my nervous tail. While Red One didn't pose the same kind of instinctual threat as a predator, she was an existential one. I would need to properly describe my intent, without any obscuration or deceit. Like how Noah had come to us on that fateful day a few months ago...I needed to trust that Red One would listen to reason. That she wasn't the monster I feared...

As if Noah could hear my internal thoughts, he turned to me. ""Tarva...I know you said you were resolute to do this earlier...but if you need to back out...or maybe let us speak for you-"" He gestured to General Kam and himself.

""No!"" I shouted, my paws balling up. ""I promised I'd do this. I...understand the threat, but I also understand the _stake_ our peoples are at in this endeavor. To back out would set a bad example for repairing whatever made the artificial intelligence angry at us to start."" I took a deep breath. ""I simply need to face the light, unflinching. I can do this...""

Noah's gaze softened at that, but Kam still kept his stoic exterior. ""...I knew you'd be strong enough, Tarva. Just...don't be afraid to lean on us if it's too much."" Noah remarked.

The pilot spoke out as the ship finally descended to the floor of the hangar with a _thump:_ ""Governor Tarva, we've landed. Atmosphere and temperature readings outside are good. I'm unlocking the hatch and extending the ramp now.""

With a rumble, the large metal hatch behind the shuttle opened, and the thin ramp extended out from its lip to the floor below. Immediately in front of me below was thankfully some faces I recognized: Elias Meier, and a few of his diplomats and advisors, like Erin Kuemper, or General Zhao. There were, however, some I didn't recognize.

_Probably Inner Cabinet members; despite being an ally of Humanity, and decently close with Meier, I didn't know everyone in the upper echelons of the UN. Our governments were structured differently, and I had no idea what exactly to expect._

As we paced down the ramp, I finally got a glimpse of the robots that the artificial intelligence aboard used. They were _massive_, the same size as an Arxur in height, if not in length due to lacking a tail. They stood with an uneasy stillness, watching from afar, but made no motion to aim, or even turn their head towards us. Noah whistled in awe, while General Kam scouted about as we finally left the ramp.

""Damn! I've seen the pictures...but they didn't quite do it justice. Even the hangar feels like I'm in a gigastadium..."" Noah muttered.

At that mention, a younger-looking Human woman walked towards us with a slightly hurried pace. She looked familiar..._ah!_ That one woman from the initial UN conference on _Nemesis!_

She introduced herself just as I realized. ""Hiya! Governor Tarva, General Kam, Ambassador Noah, welcome to the _UECNS Nemesis_. I am Hailey Whitmer, the special envoy assigned by the UN to Red One. A pleasure to meet you all."" She held out an arm for what I knew the Humans called a 'handshake'.

Noah smoothly accepted it first. ""A pleasure, Envoy Whitmer. Must be a dream having a ship this roomy."" He chuckled.

Hailey stifled a laugh at that. ""Pfft. You'd think that, until you realize the walking times. Half the travel assistance is currently in repair as we speak. But...at least we do not need to go too far, for the sake of guests at this brief.""

I interjected. ""Good to meet you as well, Envoy Whitmer. I...uh, assume Red One is waiting to speak with us there? Or are they also here?""

An oddly sultry and low feminine voice spoke from nowhere. _""Oh...I'm here....and there...and everywhere in between.""_

My head glanced in confusion at the sudden voice to my left, but all that faced that way was an empty wall. ""What? Where?-"" General Kam jumbled out for a split moment, before he too was interrupted.

_""This ship is my body, I occupy it in its entirety, despite its damaged state. I can see or hear anything within these walls.""_ From another direction stomped over one of the large robots I saw holding weapons earlier. It spoke in the very same tone. _""But...if you would prefer a physical figure to talk to, this is as close as you'll get.""_

From here, I had a far better glimpse of its features. It was a dark, slightly glossy silver, adorned with strips of red between kitbashed metal. Its bulk was heavily armored, interspersed with slight breaks to show what looked like synthetic, metallic musculature underneath. The head of the robot was oddly featureless and flat, bar a small array of sensors positioned at the spot where the eyes would be. They barely stood out from the rest of the robot, save for the mildest amount of light reflected back as single, small points of white.

_My head thought of the illustrations done of Shadestalkers, lurking deep in the Frozen Wastes. How the sparse, rocky terrain laid about the camps of Venlil were interspersed by distant sets of milky, white eyes, watching from the dark. The silhouettes of the predators stalking from the cold, tempted to close in by the thought of feeding their hunger, but dissuaded by the threat of fire. The robot's eyes...almost looked like those bright dots in the darkness._

_I knew Red One wasn't the same kind of threat; the AI was not the natural predator of Venlil like Shadestalkers were. But everything about the form of this robot felt unsettling in the way that it was formed. From the synthetic musculature coiled, ready to spring into violence, but restrained. The way the armor looked bulky, but ever-so sharp on certain edges, as if it was built to be brutally weaponized. How it towered over us...the way it carried itself..._

_No...this wasn't like the Humans, who were scary only initially, and in retrospect became less physically disturbing with each moment. No...this design was clearly built in every intention not just for intimidation…but for violence. It was built like a predator, despite being distant from any one thing in truth._

But...I couldn't let that stop me. The Humans had said that this briefing on the state of things would be cordial, despite the choice location and presence in question. I would trust that, despite the slight twinge of terror in my heart.

""I-I...um...you must be Red One, right?"" I tried to emulate a 'handshake' with my paw, despite how comically different the sizes were between us and the robot. It was as if a Dossur attempted to salute a Mazic.

Despite that, the robot took a few of its manipulator digits, and pinched my hand delicately in return, shaking my paw as a Human would. _""I am, yes.""_ It bluntly replied.

I continued, shakily, trying to get my initial statement out. ""I...as the head of Venlil Prime, and the Venlil Republic at large, am sorry for any grievances you have with us in our current state, a-and I hope we may repair our diplomatic relationship in this meeting.""

The robot's response was less receptive than I had hoped. _""We shall see. When the rest of the delegation arrives, this drone will lead you all to the lift.""_ It stepped off to the side, towards a set of open doors leading into a cargo elevator of some sort.

I decided to fill that time by approaching Meier. As I did, his face lit up in recognition. ""Tarva! Kam! Noah! So good to see you here!"" He flashed a light grin that Humans often made, but seeing Noah's so often, I had started to get used to it.

""Meier! I appreciate the invite...albeit, I'm concerned why it isn't being performed at a UN installation, rather than on-board this ship itself? Could Red One not just send a drone to a reception?"" I asked him.

Meier's face fell into a more serious look at that. ""Not quite...sadly. See, when I was agreeing to host a brief for the stare of the galaxy for Red One, she had clarified a distinct lack of capability to share her side of any strategic data onto our systems without violating our agreement to avoid overwriting government networks. Plus, there'd be a bandwidth and light delay bottleneck given she has no subspace communication properly ingrained, except through the audio-only transmitter we gave her. We, as a result, decided to host the brief on her instead, hoping to mitigate those issues. Hopefully, we'll clarify here that you - our allies - mean no harm, and aren't a threat to worry about.""

""She thinks we're a threat?!"" I bleated quietly. ""We'd be lucky to be a nuisance, in the scope of things compared to her capabilities. We're depending on her capabilities, with a war stacked this bad!""

General Kam sighed. ""I don't think she means a threat in a direct military sense, Tarva. It's more likely she sees us either as a domineering presence compared to Humanity's sovereignty, or a route of sabotage, based on what testimony Captain Odjev pulled from that one engineer."" He flicked his ears in annoyance. ""Needless to say, distinguishing we're not a threat militarily would be pointless, because sharing her technology with us would eventually make us one. And she's worried we'd be a species that takes advantage of that.""

I sputtered. ""But...that's absurd! We're allies to Humanity, and we'd not betray our herd so simply over a minor power imbalance! They've done much for us; hell, they've still held out the cattle trade to Isif, delayed as it is! I'd never authorize such hostility to a race willing to do so much for us...""

Meier sighed as well. ""And that is something we'll have to get through to her. I'm not certain the best route, sadly, but if you are just as honest as ever, it'll probably be our best bet."" General Kam's tail swept at that with some surprise, but he said nothing.

As we discussed what we knew with eachother, the final two ships docked with the Zurulian and Yotul ambassadors - Chausson and Laulo - respectively. As they and their assembled envoy groups left their ships, the walls spoke again.

_""Good. Everyone is here. Please make your way to the lift.""_ A light pulsed over the particular elevator Red One wanted us to enter.

General Kam spoke up to me. ""Let me take point, Governor Tarva. I would rather not have you step in first, just in case.""

I let him walk ahead of me at that, while Noah gripped my paw in support. ""Don't worry, Tarva. The UN would not have hosted the briefing here, were you at risk. Red One, as far as I can remember, still respects the peace, and won't disturb it without reason, despite her..._inclinations_."" He quietly whispered.

If the robot somewhat ahead could hear us, it made no attempt to speak in offense to that. It simply came to a stop within the lift, waiting for us to funnel in. As we did, the doors closed, and we began our ascent into the bulk of the _Nemesis._

It was long enough a ride that the silence between groups had grown from uncomfortable to tolerable. But finally, as the lift came to a stop, the doors opened to a rather large, but seemingly mostly empty area.

_""This...is what remains of my strategic operations.

The room lit up, and the central holo-tank hummed as a grid of points flashed for a few instants above it. The hologram then shifted into a loose picture of the galaxy.

It began to zoom in upon a particular spiral arm - our arm - into a section of space a few thousand lightyears wide, centered at Earth. A few dots in particular flashed.

_""I have access to some information about the galaxy at large, but the more distant it is from public Human knowledge, the less accurate it stands. If this war is to be won, I will require information from the lot of you, as I have been forbidden from connecting directly into Venlil Prime's Galnet.""_ A tablet was passed out to each ambassadorial group from the UN's faculty.

**Memory transcription subject: _Reslo, Refugee Aid Volunteer_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: November 2, 2136_

_Busy day so far, but at least nothing bad had happened yet._

I sat down at the table with Chesau, Connor, and Melinda during my lunch break as normal. The mess area was a loud, crowded place this time of day, both in the faculty and refugee areas, but it was a welcome change of pace to the constant work.

Melinda noticed. ""Is it just me, Reslo, or have you been getting a lot of messages lately?"" He put her elbow on the table, and leaned towards me. ""Been talking with any family back home? I tend to do it a lot.""

I put the 'lettuce wrap' down before I could take a bite of it. ""Hmm? Ohoho, no, there'd need to be a subspace connection between our two planets to manage talking to family on a communicator, and most attempts to get those running full steam on larger scales get destroyed by the Arxur. But, to answer your question, no, it's a Human who reached out to me recently, from the wild.""

Connor's eyes widened at that. ""Oh? Do tell."" He said between muffled bites.

""Well, you remember that unfortunate suicide case \[5 days\] back? Apparently...they had a partner in the military. He were...sadly lost in the Battle of Earth, but a surviving crew member had reached out from the ship he was on. Wanted to deeply apologize to Emmanuel for...potentially having made the mistake that got their ship taken out, and his partner killed...""

Melinda's breath hitched, and Connor's normal 'grin' fell to a downward shape. ""Wow, that's...really _heavy_ stuff...are they okay at least? The person who reached out?"" She asked.

My ears flicked in confirmation. _Wait, they wouldn't know what that means_...

""Yeah, they're _okay_, at least."" I hastily added. ""She told me she's still hurt, bedridden in the hospital while she heals up from her injuries, but she's not at risk of dying or anything. She took to trying to contact what families she could while she's kept in the hospital. It gave her 'something to do to try and make up', as she worded it.""

Connor spoke after. ""Wow...that's rather sad, I hope she recovers alright. Survivor's guilt is a painful thing, on top of whatever else she suffered. Who is she, did she give you her name?"" He set his utensil to the side as he and Melinda focused on me.

I began to open my mouth, before catching myself. _Wait...'Red One' is the name the visual translator gave me, but direct translations rarely correct with a name, when they're usually quite literal._

""I...actually, I have to think about that. I have her name visually translated from the messages, but visual translators are rather..._literal_. It's probably not like how a Human would say it. Wait...I might've been calling her that literal translation the entire time, oh no! Hold on just a moment!"" I pawed at my communicator quickly, hoping to quickly rectify the issue. Chesau muttered under her breath. ""Well...isn't _that_ on brand..."", before she sipped from her coffee again.

I swiped through the application quickly, finding 'Red One' in the contacts tab. I could see our prior messages talking about Leirn mostly; she was very curious about our race ever since she learned about us. I began to swiftly compose a question for her, thanks to the recently downloaded 'instant translation' overlay I had added:

\---

_To 'Red One'_

_Hey, just curious about something! I might've accidentally labeled you as directly what my visual translator did when you first composed a message to me. It's rather literal, you see, and it tends to get names wrong for whatever reason. I have you listed in a contact as 'Red One', since that's what came through in the first message. So...I'm curious as to whether your name is actually that, directly spelled out, or something else?_

\---

..._Aaaaand send! Thankfully, this new overlay makes doing that much faster. Don't have to convert with a Human website_...

Connor chuckled a moment at that, before he continued. ""I'm sure she'd understand the mistake. I didn't know the visual translators were finicky though, having never used one. What do you mean by it being too _literal?""_

I looked up from my communicator? ""Huh? Oh, um...it often translates words as their literal root-meaning, rather than remaining alien in form as a name context often does. I don't actually know what your names would come up as. I've only ever heard them spoken, not written."" My ears drooped.

Melinda frowned at that, before retrieving a paper and pen from her vest and writing something on it. ""Here...try translating that. It has my name on it.""

Curiously, I brought the personal communicators screen over the piece of paper, curious what it would return. ""Huh..."" I muttered. ""It apparently means 'sweet yaitan'. I dunno if the last bit translated for you, but there's a burrowing \[insect\] on our planet that produces-""

""Yeah, yeah, it translates. _Sweet honey_, huh? I technically never knew what my name stood for before, never looked it up..."" She said.

Connor quickly popped up, asking Melinda for a piece of paper and her pen as well. ""Ooh! Do mine, I've looked it up before, but I'm curious if it comes up differently on your end!""

I checked his slip of paper too, remarking on it in turn: ""Supposedly translates to 'lover of...hensa'? You have hensa on your planet!?"" I gasped.

Connor looked confused at that. ""I...uh...yeah, we have 'domesticated animals', but the translator isn't giving me details beyond that. What is a..._hen-sa?""_ He enunciated the word, trying to say it as I directly had.

I began to explain. ""They're a species we kept around to get rid of _scrit_ infestations on farms! We've had them since ancient times, but nowadays, what with the uplift...they'd been killed off a lot by exterminators for being 'dangerous predators'...""

Chesau was rocked out of her conversational apathy by that. ""Wait...you mean to tell me the Yotul keep domesticated predators in their homes and farms? Isn't that really dangerous?!""

I scoffed at her. ""Of course not! They're far too small to pose a threat to us - plus - they're really aggressive only to things smaller than themselves, the way Hensa are trained. But...the exterminators would 'suffer no home infested by predators'. Pushing the Federation off of Leirn's helping on getting rid of that, but..."" I trailed off, remembering my grandmother’s Hensa…

_Suddenly I heard an electronic ping, and felt the table slightly vibrate. A message!_

I quickly picked up the communicator, pulling up the message. It was from her! It read:

\---

_To Reslo._

_Sorry about the lack of response, I was talking to someone. No, my name isn't spelt 'Red One', your translator got that wrong, but I hadn't bothered to correct you since I knew you were using a translator, and I still understood the point._

_If you're curious, it's spelled like this:_

**_Scarlett Derniere_**

_Dunno if your translator will put that in properly, but if not, I can always write it out. Let me know._

\---

I quickly shot back a response to her, before changing her contact name to fit, and adjusting the translation software filter to fix the issue.

\---

_To Scarlett Derniere_

_No, that worked! Thanks, and sorry again for the mixup._

\---

I quickly input the letters into a speech program, trying to get a feel of how it's pronounced. When I did, I played it to the table, shouting: ""I got her name! No worries!""

Melinda smiled at that. ""_Scarlett Derniere_, huh? What a pretty name! Sounds very French, funny enough...wonder if she originates from around here?""

My tail hung in a bashful manner. ""Erm...not really sure, she hasn't told me much beyond her. We've mostly talked about me, and Leirn; she was really fascinated in my race and whatnot.""

Melinda spoke again. ""Well, that certainly sounds like a common thing. We're still kind of recovering from the idea that the galaxy is full of so many races, it boggles the mind! I bet it was tough for you guys when the Federation first came to your door. We're in a similar boat; it's only been a few months and _so much_ has happened, good and bad..."" She shifted in her seat. ""It's...good to know there's still some people out there curious of the stars beyond, that aren't scared stiff or angry by the Battle of Earth. There's been an overwhelming rise in that, recently...""

The conversation drifted off after that, given we had yet to touch our lunch much. But...it did give me an idea of something to ask later.

_I don't know much about Scarlett...I should ask a few questions about her life next!_

-----

**Memory transcription subject:** **_Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: November 2, 2136_

""That's absurd!"" I struck out at the robot verbally. Red One had hosted several separate conversations with different ambassador and envoy groups simultaneously over the span of these talks. But, at this point, ours had devolved into an open argument.

_""And yet, from what I can draw out from the internet, your stunts of 'sucking up' to Humanity are not widely held as popular. Sure, maybe in Dayside City, but population indexes elsewhere, especially in rural counties do not much like your policies. They see you at best woefully naive, and at worst as traitorous to the Federation.""_

I gasped. ""You cannot just cite herd statistics to me about the rural districts as an argument to how to treat the Venlil as a whole! You said-""

_""Why not? What I said is that your ideals don't stretch to the whole of the populace, and this proves it. That's not an artificial bump from your opponents either, even Veln, the main opposition runner to your re-election campaign a third of a year from now isn't directly causing that backlash, he's_ **_riding_** _it as support, and it's enough to make the polls a question.""_

_Ouuuughhh, she is_ **_frustrating!_**

""They'll see it eventually! They'll see that Humanity are worthwhile, stalwart allies, and that the Federation's labeling of your race as an equivalent to the Arxur is a lie!"" I angrily bleated at the AI.

_""Your own people can't even see it now, and you expect me to believe in you on grounds of idealism alone? You give me no staunch reason why you wouldn't turn yourselves right back to the Federation if they came knocking at your door. A good twenty percent of your population would even cheer for it!""_ Red One's voice spat from the automaton. _""No, you 'espouse' a way of peaceful co-existence with Humanity, away from the Federation, and yet you still follow its dogma in the details. You still recklessly follow needless ecological culling on baseless grounds, you categorize physiological and psychological defects on an overgeneralized diagnosis of 'predator disease', and you practice segregation of Human refugees from Venlil into shelters for safety! On what grounds do you_ **_practice what you preach!?""_** Its voice raised with frustration.

""Some of those just are...how things are done, though! I cannot change the past in an instant, and the Venlil people need time to adjust..."" I aimed back.

_""Then do not come to me with an argument of idealism, and expect me to capitulate any faster than your own race would, Governor Tarva. You want me to trust you? Then you'd best either give me collateral, or give me a truth your people would agree with_ **_now,_** _not later.""_

""Hold on!"" Zhao suddenly spoke up. ""How the hell do you know all of this? You're not allowed through the Galnet connection as per the agreement!""

The automaton turned to him. _""I do not need to be going through the connection myself if this is what Humanity is bringing back, General Zhao. You would be surprised how much the Internet scrapes off the Venlil Galnet to send back home. There's even whole forum archives ported over.""_

He interrogated further. ""You mean to tell me there's refugees porting over the election projections a third of a year from now? Bullshit...give me sources. Show me where you're pulling this from.""

A literal _wall_ of holographic articles, papers, and records appeared in front of us, some written in Standard, others in some Human language I couldn't parse. _""How many_ **_thousands_** _of sources would you like, General Zhao?""_ Red One spoke with a saccharine sarcasm.

They continued to rabble until I could see General Kam angrily stand up. ""Alright, I've had ENOUGH of this!"" He stuck a claw up demanding attention.

The robot assigned to our group whirled around at a comical speed, but made no move past that. General Kam continued forcefully. ""You want a reason we won't betray you? Fine, I'll _give_ you a reason! No...in fact, I'll give you _several!""_

""For one: Humanity is overseeing a cattle deal for untold _millions_ of our species captured by the Arxur! If you think we'd be dumb enough to stab Humanity in the back - before or after such an action goes through - you would be as stupid as they come! We’re not going to risk that many of our own!"" Kam yelled. Several envoys of other groups were staring at ours now.

I made a gesture at General Kam to quiet down, but he brushed it off. ""Another reason: if we were given a deal by the Federation to turn our backs on you, do you really think it would be to our _benefit!?_ In the Federation, we were seen as pathetic even amongst their 'benevolent herd'. So frail, so small, and weak, and flighty; we could barely stand on our own without the Gojidi to protect us! Do you really think that with all our cards down, and their ships orbiting over our worlds, that we'd be offered a deal better than yours? Better than self determination!?"" His voice carried more than ever.

I tried to stop him. ""General Kam, please! Lower your-""

But he didn't listen. ""And FINALLY: That's even assuming we'd be given a penitence deal! You saw how the species that voted for extinction treated Earth itself, trying to bombard the population to ash. You've likely heard the tripe that comes out from their systems about how the Venlil have been corrupted, even turned into monsters like you! 'Tainted by predators' as we are, they want nothing less that to likely subject us to the very same genocide they tried on you. An exterminator will kill those beyond help, and in their eyes, we're likely _far beyond saving,_ if we openly cooperated and protected you this long!""

He stepped up to the robot, a claw pointed directly up at it, and continued his rant. ""I don't even know if it was the wisest idea to help Humanity in the beginning. But Tarva got us stuck in that thorny bush; there's no way out now but to live with the burrs getting in our fur. We've got _everything_ to lose with our decisions, and the only way that we don't lose it all is by staying by Humanity's side...""

He huffed, his anger trailing off as he finally realized who he was standing up to. ""...Some Venlil might try to ignore that, but we're stuck in this _mess_ with Humans for good, and there's no way we don't get tossed with it should it get cleaned up on the Federation's terms. What choice do we have when extinction is on the line but to help you?! Is that good enough for _you!?""_

The room was silent for a moment, as General Kam's rant stopped. Not a single other group talked as the room fell into a quietude for many moments. Then, finally, the walls spoke.

_""...About time. I was wondering where the pragmatism and personal agenda was being stashed away, but it's finally revealed itself.""_

The bot stepped forward, and General Kam put his arm in front of me. _""It's not...ideal, sadly. The relationship between your people and Humanity has many kinks to work out. But...it gives me something to_ **_work_** _with more than empty, anecdotal promises.""_ The robot's head turned to me. _""Why you weren't forthright about them is exactly why I'm hesitant to dedicate my technology and knowledge your way...your head of government is not willing to share that, even pressed. How can I trust that?""_

Kam rebuked again. ""No. Not another word calling her out. A government specializes in hosting a broad spectrum of people within it; she's not lying in her genuine idealism. That's her _job_, that's what Governor Tarva is good at, and what she was initially elected for: a dream of a better tomorrow. If our government was all staffed by rough-paws like me, we'd never have gotten here in the first place. We'd have been too pessimistic, too tangled in our roots of 'realistic limitations' to ever risk helping Humanity, and we’d have shot the Odyssey out of the sky. That's why I and many millions more trust her idealism: because even if it's seemingly naive, she sees something we don't, and it's likely still better than anything I'd come up with alone, hard-headed as I am. My job is to make her hopeful dreams just a bit more grounded, but not to prevent them from soaring.""

He stared deep into those mildly glowing points the robot called eyes. ""You want the ugly truth? I'll tell you about it. I _live_ in it, I conduct it, as a General. But unless you want only an ugly relationship in turn, dealing with my kind, I suggest you give back just a smidgeon of trust that Governor Tarva has thrown her way towards Humanity. She helped save Humanity, despite the herds that disagree with her, despite the damage that did to her public image, because she thought it was _right.""_

His tail stood straight up, in defiance. ""She deserves more than your dismissal for guiding our types to that future. The Venlil deserve some respect for bleeding and dying for Humanity, for going as far as we have, despite everything in my skull screaming it's a bad idea. The least you can start with...is assuming us at least necessary allies, if not staunch ones.""

The AI was silent for a split second. _""You do understand what this entails, right? I will not treat you as nicely as the Humans do.""_

""No...you won't. But with the cards down, and extinction on the table...you'll still _treat_ us, won't you?"" General Kam's eye glimmered at that.

The robot shifted backwards some, the lean it had held to that point straightened out. With a flash, her specific list of demands came through the tablet we were given earlier...but it looked a lot shorter than it had, initially. Red One finally responded, in an oddly calm tone:

_""Perhaps...if Humanity hopes to survive...I will have to.""_

Hello,

UK based Aeropress user. Wanting to start with espresso. I only drink single origin coffee from my local roaster, so I am already getting great coffee. I just want to make a milk free espresso based drink in my home.

Budget for both grinder and machine £1000 but I can move a little on that if needed.

My friend owns my local roastery, he is a La Marzocco  dealer and swears by them. I have asked him and he gives great advice but he is very brand focused and always rotates back to La Marzocco. While I value his opinion and help greatly, I wanted to ask the wider community to other views.

In his defence he also recommended the Sage Dual boiler with grinder bundle, but I just hate the look and how appliance the machine is. I also have no need for milk, so dual boilers are not a priority.

I have looked at so many grinder and espresso machine combos, but it's overwhelming.

My main concern is buying too cheap and having to upgrade short term, or buying far too expensive and regretting it.

1h49tbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/1h49tbp/big_list_of_advice_for_those_about_to_start/,"Big list of advice for those about to start treatment or are in treatment now, from someone who just finished","Over the holidays my family kept asking me about all the tips and tricks that I have learned from others over the course of my treatment in order to pass along to someone else they knew going through this journey. After verbally relaying it to them, my family recommended I write it all down for those who could use some guidance; just as I needed guidance when I was first diagnosed. So here is my big list of tips and tricks I have learned from a combination of personal experience over the past year and advice from other Breast Cancer survivors. I'll break it down into categories to make it easier to peruse. 

**DIAGNOSIS**

1. Everyone on this subreddit says this is mentally the worst time and they are right, this will be the worst of it
2. There will be lots of waiting and tests and waiting for test results, it is scary and it is ok to be scared
3. Top priorities: 
   1. Work with the nurse navigator at your hospital/treatment center to assemble your treatment team
   2. Find an onco-psychologist (therapist who specializes in cancer patients) or other mental health professional and schedule an appointment. Getting mental health services, whether it be a therapist or a support group, should absolutely be a top priority because getting diagnosed with cancer is traumatizing and it will help you so much to process all the trauma upfront with a trained professional. 
4. There are free counseling resources available to you if you are like me and don't have access to mental health services through your health insurance/hospital/country's health services. I recommend the American Cancer Society, INOVA's Life With Cancer program, and the Young Survivor Coalition for starters. Breastcancer.org has good message boards. 
5. I found the best resources to read up on what this all is and what all the test results mean are BreastCancer.org, the National Breast Cancer Foundation (https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/), the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (https://www.bcrf.org), and  the Susan G Komen Foundation web site (https://www.komen.org/). Their stats are up to date, their medical info is up to date, and their writing style is easily accessible for those of us who do not have medical backgrounds. 
6. It's ok to not want to join online social media support groups right away, even if people recommend them. When I was first diagnosed I joined a few Facebook groups for young women with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and it freaked me out so much (there are a lot of tales of woe on there) that I had to leave them all until I was done with treatment.
7. I recommend requesting a HOPE Kit through the National Breast Cancer Foundation (https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/nbcf-programs/hope-kit/). I ordered mine right after my diagnosis and received it right after my double mastectomy and it really raised my spirits. I also used every single product they sent, it was super helpful.

**SURGERY**

1. Learn to accept help that is offered from others. You'll really need it during this time. Meal trains, blankets, help around the house, etc are all things that really make a difference during this time.
2. Usually lumpectomies don't have wound drains, but mastectomies do, so the rest of the advice below is geared more towards the mastectomy experience. 
3. Web sites like Pink Pepper Co have kits you can order if you don't know whether to start with what to have on hand: https://www.pinkpepperco.com/pages/the-four-main-mastectomy-products. 
4. I recommend having two mastectomy shirts, one mastectomy robe, a mastectomy pillow, and one shower lanyard for the wound drains. There are loads of options on Amazon and other web sites. I also personally had a pair of mastectomy pajamas which were my favorite because they had pockets to hold the wound drains and also buttons in the front plus waist ties so it was easy to get ready for bed and be comfy all night. All the mastectomy stuff was equally useful for chemo and radiation.
5. A wedge pillow/wedge mattress or a recliner that you can sleep on, it'll be necessary for the wound drains
6. A machine-washable incontinence pad for your bed. I had a few and they saved both my mattress and my wedge pillow when my wound drains had overflow incidents at the incision-site. They're also GREAT for absorbing night sweats due to the meds they make you take.
7. Laxative powder to mix into your drinks, because the meds they give you after surgery will probably block you up something fierce. I LOVED unflavored MiraLAX Mix-In Pax Single Dose Packets that I could mix into my coffee.
8. Have some disposable latex gloves ready in case you have to apply some ointments or creams. If you have a nipple-sparing mastectomy they may give you nitroglycerine ointment to put on your nipples to stimulate blood flow and in that scenario you NEED to wear gloves to apply it. 
9. Dry shampoo because you won't be able to shower or wash your hair for awhile
10. Make sure to stay on top of your physical therapy if any is prescribed, it'll pay dividends later

**CHEMOTHERAPY**

1. This is a bit more ""choose your own adventure"" because there are different types of chemo and infusions given for different versions of Breast Cancer. I can only speak from my personal experience getting 4 rounds of TC chemo.
2. See #1 from the ""surgery"" category above. Learn to accept help that is offered from others. You'll really need it during this time. Meal trains, blankets, help around the house, etc are all things that really make a difference during this time.
3. Prior to starting chemo, I very strongly recommend getting your eyebrows microbladed. Once you start chemo you will not be able to get this done because you will be too immunocompromised. I got something called 3D microblading done prior to starting chemotherapy and I am incredibly grateful I did because I lost all of my eyebrows and nobody ever noticed. 
4. I chose not to wear wigs when my hair fell out. Instead I opted for pre-tied headscarves from Etsy and some nice headcovers from Headcovers Unlimited (www.headcovers.com). If you go the headscarf route, I recommend getting something to wear underneath it to hold it in place. Amazon, Etsy, or Headcovers Ulimited have products that you can purchase to go under the scarves to hold them in place and prevent them from moving. 
5. Chemo was scary, but it was not as scary as I had imagined. I was able to work full time through nearly all of it, and I work an office job. I only took sick days on my ""bad"" days and otherwise was able to function. It wasn't a fun experience working through chemo but I was able to do it and I'm glad I did because it gave me something else to focus on.
6. Drink water like you are running an Iron Man. My family and friends make fun of me because once I was told I was going to need chemotherapy I bought a 64 oz water bottle from Amazon with a bunch of handles and straps attached to it and carried that thing around like a toddler with their favorite stuffie. Joke's on them, I drank through it once to twice a day like it was my job and came out of chemo with totally normal kidneys and a happy liver. My oncologist even gave me a gold star and told me I was a star patient! 
7. Swish your mouth every single morning and every single evening with 1 tsp baking soda mixed in an 8 oz glass of water. I got a big ol' container of baking soda off Amazon and that thing lasted me the entirety of chemo. It'll help prevent/lessen mouth sores.
8. I used an app on my phone called Medisafe to help me keep track of all the meds I needed to take and what times I needed to take them. Chemotherapy is a time when you will be taking an overwhelming amount of pills and injections and it's CRITICAL to keep up with it all and keep it all straight. Mobile apps can help with that. One family member of mine used an Excel spreadsheet instead of a mobile app. Just do whatever works for you, but make certain you stay on top of logging your meds and what time you took them. 
9. A cold cap, cold mitts, and cold socks are highly recommended. I got cold therapy mitts and socks from Suzzipad on Amazon. For the cooling cap I got a cold cap from Icekap on Amazon. Wear them during the first and last 15 minutes of each infusion to help stave off neuropathy. I carried them in a cooler to the infusion center to keep them cold. 
10. I recommend cutting your hair short or shaving your head prior to chemo if you are not cold-capping through your infusion center. It will make a big difference later on because your scalp gets really tender when the hair starts falling out and having buzzed hair makes it easier to manage. As my family liked to say, it's easier to manage ""sprinkles.""
11. Scalp oil for your head, I wore it during the day and at night
12. Lemon and/or ginger hard candies are fantastic, they will help with the bad chemo taste
13. Similar to the hard candies, I found queasy lozenges (otherwise known as queasy drops) helpful
14. I strongly recommend a machine-washable incontinence pad for your bed (see #6 from the ""surgery' category above). This is because chemo can cause righteous night sweats, and those pads are fantastic at absorbing all the sweat and saving your mattress. 
15. If you end up with constipation due to chemotherapy, my advice from #7 in the ""surgery"" category applies. I strongly recommend having laxative powder to mix into your drinks. I liked the powder more than the pills because it was easier on my stomach. I used unflavored MiraLAX Mix-In Pax Single Dose Packets that I could mix into my coffee and it fixed things right up.
16. Food cravings are a thing with chemo. You may find you crave carbs, apparently this is a known thing with chemo patients. I wanted bread, bread, bread all the time because I think my body was trying to get me to ingest things that would soak up the poison in my system. I became voracious for things like pita bread and naan because I could put strong-flavored sauces on them which were still easy on my tummy while being able to over-power the loss of taste/flavor profiles.
17. Walk or do yoga if possible. Just do something to move your body, no matter how crummy you feel. It doesn't have to be very much. On my worst days I would just walk one short 15-minute lap around my block. 
18. I had some small little activities to do to take my mind off how crummy I felt on my bad days. These activities were things like drawing outlines in a reverse coloring book (https://a.co/d/3W96u8R) and knitting. Sometimes all I could do was watch TV. A couple of times I was so sick all I could do was listen to podcasts or audio books with my eyes closed.
19. PUT CUTICLE OIL ON YOUR NAILS EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! Every. Single. Day. You can buy it anywhere, it doesn't need to be any special brand or anything. The key is to keep your cuticles moisturized. I got through my whole entire chemo regimen without any nail discoloration or nail issues at all because my oncologist made a big song and dance about how cuticle oil was important for nails. I will say I hated doing it, it's messy and takes forever to absorb and it had a bad habit of getting all over my stuff no matter what I tried to reduce the mess. In retrospect I think buying and wearing some cheap cotton gloves that you can buy at the local drug store would have solved the messiness issue. 
20. I really wish someone had warned me that you typically gain weight with chemo. I was shocked to learn this. The steroids they put you on will stimulate your appetite and cause swelling. It is important to eat during this time, the doctors will encourage you to either maintain or gain weight during this period as it helps with treatment. 
21. If you want to take supplements, PLEASE run them by your oncology team first. Everything interacts with everything so don't take anything unless it's blessed off but your doctors first.
22. During and after chemo I switched from shampoo to hair cleanser. Even when I was completely bald, I continued to wash my scalp with hair cleanser in order to keep it clean. Now that my hair is growing back, the hair cleanser keeps it clean and is also gentle on my ultra-fine post-chemo hair. I use a product called Unwash Anti-Residue Cleanser but you can use any hair cleanser to keep things clean.
23. MOISTURIZE!!! Chemo will dry your skin out like nuts. Make sure you have moisturizers on hand for your face and body and that these moisturizers are all scent free and made for sensitive skin.
24. You will probably end up with some weird side effects you never anticipated. For me, one of the weirdest ones was muscle hypersensitivity in the first week after each infusion. The first week of my second infusion is the only time in my life I ever threw out my back, and I my back went out from sitting weird in a hospital bed when I was being treated for Neutropenia. 
25. If you have questions related to sexual health during chemotherapy, I recommend asking your gynecologist (or urologist if you are male). I have learned through my experience that oncologists can get rather squirmy and uncomfortable when you ask them such questions while you are in treatment. 

**RADIATION**

1. My radiation center gave me Calendula cream to apply twice to three times a day to the treated area. Your center may give you something different, the only chief advice here that I received was that whatever cream you start with is the cream you should use consistently. Don't switch between products during this time. 
2. Radiation treatments made me queasy sometimes, which was unexpected. Those days I found sucking on the queasy drops helped. Eating protein helped too. 
3. Soft, loose-fitting shirts without irritating seams on the inside (especially by the armpit) are a must because your skin will eventually become very sensitive with the more rounds you do.

**MISCELLANY**

1. I recommend a book called ""The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer."" I listened to the audio book version of it when I was undergoing chemotherapy and it helped me such much to understand what I was going through and why. It helps open up the world of oncology and give a better understanding of what chemo and radiation both are as treatments and how they came to be. It also helped me to understand what cancer actually is.
2. I took classes through INOVA's Life With Cancer program (https://www.lifewithcancer.org/) on things like what to expect from breast surgery and nutrition during chemotherapy and found it all immensely helpful. I strongly recommend finding a class on nutrition run by a hospital or reputable health care organization, because there is *so much* junk science out there about nutrition and cancer and it can be hard sometimes to know what is real science and what is woo-woo nonsense. Programs that have licensed medical doctors running the content are critical. 
3. Social media (I'm sure there are a lot more than this but it's a good starting point):
   1. Instagram: A few reputable people I follow on Instagram are Dr Eleonora Teplinsky (@drteplinsky), breastcancerorg (@breastcancerorg), and u/DrHeatherRichardson's account (@bedfordbreastcenter)
   2. Facebook: Young Survival Coalition (there are dozens of other breast cancer groups on Facebook but YSC is my favorite)
   3. YouTube: Yerbba's channel (https://www.youtube.com/@yerbba) is outstanding for up-to-date breast cancer content that is delivered in easily-digestible videos that are also caring and compassionate. It's run by Dr. Jennifer Griggs, a licensed medical professional, and she films new content all the time. 

Ok that's all I can think of right now. I'm sure there's more that I am forgetting but that's all I can muster at the moment. I myself am transitioning over to maintenance so I'm about to go through more learning and growing as I figure out how to navigate my next phase of treatment with medications like Verzenio, Zometa, Zoladex, and others. I've been on Tamoxifen for six months now and thankfully haven't really had any side effects aside from some minor joint pain. I'd love to hear everyone else's advice and recommendations in the comments!",23,1733077698.0,breastcancer,0,0.96,False

1h49o77,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1h49o77/homemade_nail_polish_recipe/,Homemade Nail Polish Recipe,"So I've tried different nail polish recipes that have been put out there- most of which that were wax based and burned my fingernails while trying to apply. It took me a lot of research to come up with this recipe just simply due to not being able to find the right product as a base- but I finally came across shellac flakes! Normally used for wood varnishes, shellac flakes are naturally occurring and come from the lac bug. You take some dewaxed shellac flakes and you dissolve it in alcohol (everclear) and there's your nail polish base. Ive had a lot of trial and error trying to make it completely natural I started by using dragons blood resin for color and tried adding instant coffee to darken it up because it kept coming out a transparent orange color while the coffee did help it was still a little bit transparent and took forever to dry (up to an hour if two coats were applied) as the dragons blood resin increased drying time. I decided to try another pigment using some iron oxide for a stronger color and it worked very well- it works for micas too. These pigments can come from natural origin but a lot are synthetically produced but it's the best recipe I can offer as of now.

I dissolved a lot of shellac flakes into everclear until it became a maple syrup color and consistency. As I thought it the base would have to be as thick as nail polish this also took a long time to dry so I ended up going 1/2 shellac liquid and 1/2 everclear when making the nail polish. (I used this concentration for my original recipe with dragons blood and instant coffee as well but again it was too much resin so it still took too long to dry) Feel free to explore with your own concentration but this is the only recipe I have currently- it took about 6+ hours to test and create 😆



Shellac-
Fill 3/4 of small mason jar with shellac flakes and the rest with everclear- color and consistency should be like maple syrup you can add more as it dissolves until you achieve it (this can last around 6 months)

Nail Polish-
Fill about half a nail polish bottle with iron oxide or mica (1 1/2 tsp)
Add 1/2 tbsp of everclear 
Add 1/2 tbsp of shellac mixture 
This is for a big nail polish bottle- you'll need a metal ball for it too. Again you can play with how much shellac flakes you add into the alcohol originally then you wont need to do that. (Takes out the extra step)

Make sure to shake before each use as it will separate (comes off easily with a cotton ball and alcohol) dries a bit matte but I use oil on my hands anyways which gives it shine-  hope you all have fun!

Part 2,"Once they reached home everyone was preparing for bed. Brian pulled off his jacket as he walked Liam to bed. “Can I sit in?” Her soft voice came with a yes from Brian as she followed. Brian softly read to Liam as the sun disappeared. Amber sat listening on the floor.

“And just like that she was gone, like a starship she met the sky, thousands of stars said hello…” Amber just zoned out into the story with Liam as she fell in love with the voice telling it. And like that Liam was asleep and so was Amber on the floor. Brian thought she was so cute lying there like that. He just picked her up taking her to bed. As he moved into the hallway Sofia appeared.

“Oh look at that, I just want to give her a kiss goodnight.” Brian clicked his tongue at her words as he pulled Amber away from her. Brian laid her down in bed. Brian gently tried to wake her so they could go outside to the van but Amber just gripped his arm tight pulling him into bed with her. And like that they were asleep. 

Time seemed to disappear. Brian's eyes opened to the morning. He was alone. Brian rolled in bed as his hand hit paper. A note was on the bed.

I’m at the graveyard, I'll see you later Amber.

Brian dragged himself into the kitchen as coffee was pouring. Sofia was watching TV as she ate her muffin. Doge was drinking up her cream and sugar in the kitchen. Sofia didn't sit long as she got up to wake Liam. It was time to get ready for the day. Sofia and Brian got dressed for work before loading into the car.

“I didn't see Aunt Amber today.” Liam's voice filled the car with silence. Sofia waited for Brian's response. 

“Today is a very special day for her, so she is…..well she is……ok bud listen, she is thinking about an old friend today that is no longer with us, so she's feeling sad today.” The conversation stopped as Liam’s school came into view. Brian couldn’t help but think about where Amber was as he wished his son a good day at school. 

The grass was dead where feet took their walks. Flowers laid in front of lonely stones. A couple quiet voices were scattered around as Amber sat in front of a small grave. The stone just read Amber Beck. Amber crossed her legs as the morning air whipped by her. 

“I slept well, in a bed for once, it’s been hard but Brian makes it better.” Amber’s voice shot into the dirt as she pulled up yellowing grass. “I guess you could say I found a family, it’s nice being surrounded by them, but I still wish you were here.” Amber pulled out a shiny golden trumpet out of its case. “I cleaned it for you like I said I would.” Amber set the trumpet down in front of the grave before pulling herself up onto her feet. Amber just walked herself out of the graveyard as she texted Brian. 

Brian would never check his texts in the middle of a teaching lesson, but he saw the name. Brian told his class to open the book to page thirty four as he sat down in his chair. As the kids read silently Brian texted her back under his desk. And just like that the bell rang. Brian raced through halls of kids as he scooped up his lunch. Brian decided to forgo the table of teachers and eat in his classroom. Someone else had the same idea. Sofia followed him closely. She took up a child sized desk in front of his as the smell of pizza wrapped around their noses. 

“So what do you have planned after work today?” Brian took in her words as he thought about them. “Or are you just heading home?” Brian let her question take control as he pulled out his phone. 

“Amber is hitting an open mic, hold on, I have to make a couple calls.” Sofia watched curiously as he dialed. “Hey, are you busy tonight? I need a favor.” Sofia couldn’t wait to hear what he had planned. Time seemed to fly by as school work continued. Once the last bell rang Brian hurried out to the car. “Hurry up!” Brian honked the horn trying to get Sofia to move faster. Sofia struggled to keep up with his quick pace as she raced to the car. Brian had a bright smile on his face that didn't seem to want to fade. 

Amber's face wasn't so cheerful. She just sat in her van trying to relax. The constant noise of homeless struggles echoed outside the van as Amber sipped her energy drink. She moved into the driver seat as she happened upon a fight in front of the convenience store. She just averted her eyes as she pulled into the street. Traffic kept her from arriving on time but she was there nonetheless. Amber pulled her acoustic guitar from behind her seat as she jumped out of the van. She hurried into the familiar club with brick walls. Amber pulled herself on to the stage dodging a guitar on and stand and a drum set. As she sat down on a stool she looked up. Her eyes narrowed on the small crowd as she caught sight of him. Brian was sitting directly in the middle. He just smiled watching her. Amber lifted her guitar as she checked her tuning. Then she started to play. 

“There's a picture of us that looks so good it feels fake, a flash of that trip to the lake, I was so tired you didn't let me wake, sun said hello you just let me bake, sunburn so stern it was something I couldn't take and now I feel so tired and lame, but I still miss you.” Her words felt heavy falling into the crowd of the bar as her soft yet scratchy guitar playing kept the mood up. Her words pulled a story around everyone's heads even if they weren't putting it together themselves. And just like that her song was over. Brian's smile did not fade in fact it grew brighter. Amber thought he was acting creepy. As Amber pulled her hand off her guitar her elbow hit a keyboard stand. Amber observed the instruments surrounding her. Her eyes caught the red guitar next to her and before she could pull everything together figures joined her on stage. Kitty moved behind the drums as she picked up her sticks. Rudy appeared out of nowhere as she tapped Amber on the shoulder before getting behind her keyboard. And last Brian picked up his guitar. Before Amber could say anything Brian pulled the mic over to himself.

“Hello! I'm Bri and this is Ber and together we're the Ambers!” These words pulled Amber off her stool. She just looked up a Brian with stars in her eyes. 

“I didn't know you played,” Amber said, with a cheeky smile forming. Brian just adjusted his trap as he turned to her.

“I dabble.” And with that Kitty slammed her sticks together counting down. Amber pulled the mic back to herself.

“This song has a title we haven't thought of yet!” And like that the music poured out into the bar. 


“And you don't want to understand the way I feel, and we can't live without regrets the feelings real, it's real.” Amber sang each line in the song in harmony with herself. “Don't underestimate the way I feel if I cry, listen to the sound it makes me feel alive.” Amber's voice was loud and aggressive, but also a little soft and sweet. The soft and sweet voice was all Brian was fixated on but he was also fixated on the loud aggressive one because they were one in the same. Mesmerized with his head bobbing as he followed along as best he could to the music. Sofia shouted to him as she waved her drink. Brian’s mind pulled him back to when he would have been sitting next to her looking up at the stage. Brian pulled himself forward on his feet clapping as their song finished. Brian noticed he was the only one clapping and it was extremely awkward. Sofia couldn’t take her eyes off the happiness spilling out of Brian and neither could Amber as she kissed him. The pair just stood there ignoring everyone around them as they embraced each other.

“Oh God I love you.” Brian's words brought the same words out of her. It looks like they wanted to drop their instruments right there and take each other. That of course did not happen as Kitty's voice pulled them back.

“Next song! Let's go!” Brian just grabbed Amber's hand kissing it.

“What do you say? Wanna play another one with me?” Brian's words brought a vibrant reaction out of Amber. 

“Always.” And like that another song took the stage and filled the air.

Of course it was plugged up and most of the coffee landed in the waste bin.  After many YT disassembly videos, beer, whisky and much cursing I have a Pixie that makes delicious coffee.

I seem to have to fidget with the pods a lot to get it into proper position for brewing.  I crushed the first 3 pods I tried.  Now I remove the drip tray and bin and use fingers from above and below to work the pod into the brew tube as it closes. This works but can't be normal.  

I've never seen or used any other nespresso machines so I have nothing to compare it to.    If I just drop in a pod like seen in the ad videos I'd never get a successful cup of coffee.

what an unsettling FTC! i was disappointed in a few things, and i thought they'd get covered at the reunion but they didn't, so i wanna talk about it with fans.

1. what was everyone's problem with cassandra? especially alex - alex didn't seem like the type of person who would be a bitter jury member. i didn't hate him during the season up until that moment. why was he yelling at cassandra? why was he not letting her speak? i know the jury can go on rants but alex's towards cassandra seemed so unwarranted. he was never in an alliance with her, so she didn't betray him. if anything, he should be angrier with dreamz for betraying the four horseman. i felt so bad for cassandra in that moment because it felt like it came out of nowhere. she was such a quiet player and didn't give alex any reason for him to be so bitter (unless i'm forgetting any moments)
2. lisi...her attitude towards dreamz at FTC was absolutely insane. i'm so glad dreamz straight up asked 'do you think i'm dumb' because he deserved to fight back on that. and the water shoes with cassandra...she thought she ate but she didn't.
3. the good: michelle! i appreciate when jury members aren't bitter. although she can be seen as a little bit boring for tv, i needed her positivity in that tribal council. wish they showed her later as a recovery/break between all the bitter jury members!
4. the good: edguardo. i liked how he asked a very clear question on gameplay. he just wanted to know the truth, and i think FTC is a good time to ask anything you didn't know from the game.
5. not showing closing statements: i felt so bad for cassandra that i felt it was necessary to hear her closing statement. i just wanted her to get the chance to defend herself. especially because although she was a quiet player, she did get every single questionnaire answer correct in that one challenge and ultimately got to the final 3. she was boring for tv but there have been worse players in the past that didn't get the same heat as her. i guess we'll never know what she said, and it clearly didn't convince anyone to vote for her.

in general, i couldn't help but wonder if microaggression was going on in FTC and throughout the season. with lisi and stacey being so unnecessarily rude to dreamz (coffee scene was absurd) to alex getting so aggressive with cassandra at FTC to rocky's uncalled for bullying of anthony, i cannot think of actual reasons those bullies were given to act that way, unless any key moments weren't shown. i was so looking forward to the reunion to address some of this and the reunion ended up being the worst one i've watched lol :(

anyway i actually really enjoyed this season overall anyway! would love to know everyone else's thoughts :)",3,1733077232.0,survivor,3,1.0,False

I met a man in April through reddit, we spoke for a month before meeting. He was initially going to set me up with a friend of his, and I myself was finally happily single for for the first time in a long time and had zero expectations. We met for coffee and we absolutely hit it off. Within a couple of weeks we were in a relationship and there were very strong feelings there on both ends and we had told each other we loved each other within 3 weeks.

Things were fantastic for the first couple of months, he initiated and planned dates and he wanted to do stuff together. He was attentive, he made plans for the future, he made time to see me, he loved being around me i could see it in his eyes the way he looked at me. He told me I made him feel safe and loved and how happy I made him. We talked about getting married and going on holiday with his sister, and moving in together in the future, and what dog we would get (these talks were always initiated by him).

 I felt so loved and so secure in his feelings towards me. 2 weeks after meeting he took me on a beautiful birthday trip and then out to dinner and at dinner told me he was going to make me his wife.

Then two months in he stopped wanting to do stuff, he stopped making plans and taking me on dates (I don't need money spent but quality time together), he stopped wanting to spend as much time together, and he was happy to go two weeks at a time now without seeing me. It evolved in to me going to his house once a week on a Friday or a Saturday evening, we'd hang out for a few hours before we went to bed, and in the morning he'd drop me home so he could spend the day to himself to relax and play video games. Before he would have wanted to spend at least 1 day a week spending quality time together doing stuff, enjoying each other's company. I went from feeling securely attached to anxiously attached about how he felt about me. Worrying why he had pulled back and stopped wanting to spend time together and do stuff together. It felt like he got complacent and stopped making an effort..?

I should note at this point he started to go through a period of stress and depression due to his unstable work and trying to find a job he liked.

About a month before we broke up, he took me for the weekend to meet his mum and his grandad who was ill. He introduced and me as his wife to his grandad, and said to his mum in front of me ""I think I've found the woman i want to marry"". We had our first big argument after that weekend and things were never really the same again, ending up in a classic (what I now see no) avoidant anxious push pull dynamic, with me getting more and more anxious when he needed space and trying to balance his need for alone time with my need for intimacy.

We struggled on for another month, making it to 5 months together before he told me he could now only see me on a Friday night and some of Saturday day due to his new job (no compromise on the day, If I wasnt able to see him on the day of his choice I'd have to go without). 

TLDR; boyfriend was great for first 2 months, went through a period of stress and depression and stopped wanting to do stuff, stopped intiating plans and dates, stopped wanting to spend as much time together. Then pulled back after seeing his grandad unwell and then his new job.  ",1,1733077126.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

I’m (47M) planning a trip to Costa Rica with my parents (77M/77F), my sister (42F), her daughter/my niece (15F), and my girlfriend (42) from **April 12 - 19, 2025**. I visited Nosara about 12 years ago and loved the laid-back vibe, the food, and the beautiful combination of mountains and beach. I hope to create a similar experience for my family, focusing on relaxation, local food, stunning views, and easy access to a great beach. We also hope to visit a volcano and enjoy Costa Rica’s natural beauty.

Here’s what we’re looking for:

* A **stunning view** with privacy and safety (a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom secluded property would be ideal while meeting a budget of $350 or less nightly).
* Quick access to an **exceptional beach** for relaxed swimming and lounging.
* **Local food,** coffee, fruits, and juices that give us a real taste of Costa Rica (but not too commercialized).
* A **few low-key activities**, including a day-trip to a volcano (nothing too strenuous as my parents are in their upper 70s).
* We prefer a quieter, more authentic experience to avoid heavily touristy areas.

We plan to **fly into San José** but are open to flying into **Liberia** if it’s more convenient for the final destination (I haven’t checked flights yet to see if it’s cost-effective). I’m considering staying the first night in San José, renting a large vehicle, and heading to our final destination the following day. We’d like to return to **San José the night before we fly out** for a quick and easy return to the airport the next day.

Does anyone have suggestions for:

* A **beach area** that meets most of these criteria?
* A volcano we can visit on a **low-key day trip**?
* ***Any itinerary suggestions or other tips for getting the most out of our week in Costa Rica?***

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much in advance for your help!",1,1733076887.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,1.0,False

I (34F) have worked exclusively remote for the last 3 years. My husband used to work remote as well, but changed jobs last year to an on-site position.

Maybe we can help each other out. 

I do not have to work from my home, I can work from anywhere so meeting at a coffee shop is totally doable for me.
