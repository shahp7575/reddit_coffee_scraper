1h5tuyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1h5tuyr/is_this_what_good_coffee_tastes_like_19grams/,"Is this what ""good"" coffee tastes like? (19grams advent calendar)","TL;DR at bottom

Hey all, for the past couple months I've been getting into pourover coffee after many years of ""convenient"" coffee (Nespresso, Keurig, etc). I started with an 8cup Chemex I had lying around and a random hand grinder. I didn't realize how terrible the grinder was until I got a Kingrinder K6 a few weeks ago! Anyway...

I've been dialing in the flavor I like of Peet's Major Dickasons blend. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that my reference is Mcdonald's coffee, but I've been trying to get as much of that roasty nutty smokey coffee flavor as possible, while avoiding the astringent over-extracted aftertaste. I've seen in a lot of places that the quality of the coffee makes a huge difference, and I wanted to expand my coffee horizons, so I got the 19grams advent calendar this year!

All 3 days I've had so far have had none of that smokey/nutty/roasty coffee flavor I expected, and were instead strongly citrus-y, acidic, floral, and almost tea-like. If I didn't know better, I would have thought I *was* drinking tea! I was able to taste the notes that each coffee mentioned, but literally zero bitter coffee taste.

So I can't help but wonder if I'm doing something wrong... The gigantic 8 cup chemex for a single cup is probably a big part of it (I was brewing much larger 30g/500g of the Peet's so maybe it was less of an issue there). I've got a Hario Switch coming in a few days to hopefully fix that issue.

Anyway, my question is: does it seem like I'm just not used to lighter roast coffees, or does it sound more like I'm doing something very wrong and ruining this excellent coffee? What I've been drinking has been interesting, and I could see myself acquiring a taste for it... but I simply have no reference point to know if this is ""it"" or not... 

And a follow up question: if I'm ruining the coffee, what's the most likely place I should look to fix my approach?

Thanks for reading :)

TL;DR: got the 19grams advent calendar this year and all 3 days have been ""sour"" (but not necessarily in a bad way...). I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong.",1,1733249428.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

For those of you, like me, are more likely to do something when you understand the ""why"" behind it (because I, for example, heard this for a long time, but still kept eating a bagel and coffee for breakfast).

As I understand it:

(1) Protein is the building block for amino acids, and amino acids are what your brain needs to make dopamine. [ADDitude Magazine](https://www.additudemag.com/nutrition-harmonizes-adhd-brain/amp/) | [Instagram Post by Nutrimindcoach](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DChc_37vyU6/?igsh=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==)
(2) Vyvanse specifically is not dopamine,  but instead helps your body make more dopamine amd/or keep dopamine in your system longer. So you need more building blocks. [Drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/tips/vyvanse-patient-tips#:~:text=Red%20blood%20cells%20break%20down%20lisdexamfetamine%20into,nerve%20synapse%20(the%20space%20between%20two%20nerves).) | [US National Institute of Health](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2873712/#b30-ptj35_5p273)

I'm not a doctor, so those of you with more science understanding, feel free to weigh in. Personally I can add my name to the list of folks vouching that adding protein helps with meds, so even if you aren't a fan of the idea at first I encourage you to give it a shot!

Could guy please share tips in relations how to figure out spices - like i believe there is a standard set of spices being used in almost every single dish and adding any other is more like complimentary to give it more of bespoke flavour. 

I would really appreciate, if you have any suggestions for channel on youtube where the content creator starts from really basic dishes like making daal tadka, some flavoured rice or maybe a different way of preparing tea or coffee. (One may say that you can just do youtube search and voila the results are there - but there are so many) and i believe on getting it right at first.

You may also please share any tips you have which helped you to ease this process and i think other folks on this sub could take some inspiration out of it.

What I am trying to understand is how some people are always doing new things all the time.

One day they’ll go for coffee with a friend, the next day they’re at the beach.

I guess it’s the pursuit on novelty perhaps? I’m not entirely sure.

1. join an active guild. i'm not in one myself but it works best if you join a really popular one or if you have friends outside of the site that play that you can hang out with. you could start your own but from my experience, it's kinda hard to get people to join unless you're already friends
2. adopt or create a pet from the pound to zap/train/paint to rehome. i'm working on one right now. 
3. go to the jellyneo item database and make a wishlist for each pet with their favorite items. this gives them a little more personality. does your halloween pet like gross foods? is your usual a vegetarian? what petpets does each pet like? what furniture do they have in their room?
4. when you have to do the daily quest that requires you to buy things, look for items on your pets' list to feed/groom them with
5. don't go to that goddamn general store and buy a blue shorthair brush and coffee with marshmallows, actually take your time, look around, and buy items you really like looking at. don't worry about the price because you get 20k anyway plus whatever other NP you get from daily quests and trudy's
6. go to [impress.openneo.net](http://impress.openneo.net) and come up with customs for each pet. maybe even outfit changes for some 
7. collect stamps or trading cards. i'm personally not really into either but it's kinda fun to track down the rare ones if you're into that
8. when you offer on TP lots, actually look at the person's account and add a couple of items to your offer that they would enjoy. the game is so much more enjoyable when you actually look at other players as actual people instead of just focusing on hoarding NP and items
9. buy items you like from other players and donate them in bulk to the money tree. it doesn't have to be anything suuuuper expensive. just stuff that isn't the usual trash that's in there. you'll also help other people buy buying items that might not be sold as fast otherwise. it's always fun to see food and toys and shit instead of just rotten boots. i like to fill my inventory with items of a certain theme like, all cheese items or items that fit a certain ""aesthetic""
10. start a gallery. pick a theme you haven't seen anyone else do or just stuff it with items you like
11. write a description for all of your pets. even if you suck ass at writing, you could literally just make a bulletpoint list with their likes and dislikes or personality traits
12. play the flash games and try to beat your high scores or go for a trophy/avatar
13. go to jellyneo's avatar checklist and see what avatars might be achievable for you. 
14. go to the spotlight page or the spotlight boards and look at other people's art/galleries/customs.
15. vote in the beauty contest. i never really look at the boards tbh. i just go species by species and vote on the one i like the best because i hate that it's a popularity contest
16. personally, i find conversations via neomail a little awkward but i love sending random gifts to neofriends 
17. solitaire/ cheat/ neoquest/ pyramids
18. participate in as much as you can. you might not make it into the neopian times but it doesn't hurt to try
19. before you finish playing for the day, make sure all of your pets are fed, brush their teeth, play with a toy, i like to take the pet i'm training out of the training school before i go to bed
20. take at least one pet out of the neolodge and keep them out. i've tried keeping them all out and it's too much for me to keep up with personally but just my active pet being out makes it more fun",3,1733248932.0,neopets,0,1.0,False

I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

She was really eager this year to have my mother's family join this year, including me and my sister her husband, and her kids because haven't seen each other in a while. She was insistent that we all stay at her house so we could spend more time with each other.


Before I agreed to go, I confirmed with her that I would be able to sleep in a bed, in a room with a door that closes. I'm ok with sharing a bed or a room, but I need an actual bed or a room. I am the only one of my siblings or cousins who is single or childless/childfree. Because of this, historically I have been relegated to the living room couch or floor during holidays. It has always sucked. I am overweight so I wake up with back pain. I have had air mattresses deflate on me overnight due to a hole. I can't fall asleep until the the younger adult family members finish hanging out at 1 am and then I get woken up at 6 am by someone making coffee. People keep on moving my luggage. I get only a couple of hours of bad sleep and wake up in pain. I have pledged to myself that if I wasn't able to get a real bed in an actual room, that I would get a hotel room.


 Thanksgiving week arrives and I'm pleasantly surprised that I was assigned a room and a Queen bed to myself. All of the adults had beds they shared with thier SO. It was great for the first night.

But the day before Thanksgiving my cousin (35M) arrives with his GF (28F) who is 6 months pregnant as a surprise. He had originally told my Aunt he wasn't going to be able to make it because of work, but he just wanted to surprise her. But now, there isn't enough beds for everyone. My mother said that I could give up my bed to the couple and sleep on the air mattress in the den, but my Aunt insisted I stay in my room. My cousin ended up on the couch and his GF on an air mattress.

My mother is now lecturing me about being a bad guest. She thinks I should of insisted that my cousin and his GF take the bed, especially because she is pregnant. 

AITA?

Samples ordered: Rhinoceros, Squid, Moth, Camel, King Cobra, Dragonfly, Chameleon, Penguin

Free sample: Sacred Scarab

Who I am: 23 year old man, I am definitely not a fragrance enthusiast but I am slowly getting into the community. No credentials whatsoever.

My gf: 21 year old woman

Phase 1 review

We sprayed the samples once on the cardboard cutouts they come in, and smelled them.

**Penguin**

My review: I had read that Penguin was not so great, but I disagreed. I really smelt the “cold” and juniper notes, but to me it mostly smelt like a hospital room. I could not smell any other note that came in the packaging. When it dried down, I smelt the sandalwood a bit better and it became less fresh and more serious, giving way into a more mature scent that reminded me of something my grandfather might wear (in a positive way). Delivers great on the concept and execution, and it still smells like something highly wearable in specific occasions.

Gf: Good scent, it’s a little basic, safe and nice, I would definitely wear it. 

**Camel**

Mine: Camel lived up to the hype, in my opinion. It was warm, and highly complex. The only notes I could realistically pick out were the orange blossom and the incense. I could see a cowboy smelling like this. I would wear it on cold days and if I wanted to invite intrigue. I especially liked it because it reminded me of the smells from back home in Spain. It is very complex, so I admittedly felt overwhelmed by it.

Gf: Oh I love this one. It smells like being in a shop, I would definitely wear it often, would work well on anyone regardless of gender. This one was my favorite out of all the ones.

**Rhinocero**s

Mine: I have mixed feelings about Rhinoceros. I really, really liked it, although I would be self conscious to wear this in public. I immediately got hit with a blast of rum, leather, tobacco, and incense. That curious combination also smelt a little damp, and the smell reminded me of cold, quiet churches from my home country. The dry down is a lot more woody. Overall, it’s the bold statement that the house says you are getting. I am not disappointed at all, and it is a pleasant smell for me. I might wear this if I really wanted to attract attention, like hey, I am here and look at me, which is usually not my style. I probably would still wear it around the house, for myself, when I want to feel badass. 

Gf: I dislike this one greatly. It tries too hard. It is somewhat medieval.

**Chameleon**

Mine: Chameleon smells like sun tan lotion. The mango, vanilla, and coconut are really prominent. There are also floral undertones which I quite liked. Highly enjoyable, probably for the summer. However, I would not say this is my style as I feel it is too easy going. I would totally wear this if I were rich and I spent my evenings in Mikonos out partying. There is a lot of complexity, but the complexity that you might get when you smell a garden and you enjoy the overall smell, rather than a complexity where you want to keep going and pick out everything, which is how I felt when I smelled Rhinoceros. I can see why this is a “Chameleon” fragrance. Definitely safe and pleasing.

Gf: Its almost lemony. I like it, I think, I don’t know. Once you start smelling the fruit, I like it. Its kind of like, tropical.

**Dragonfly**

Mine: I expected to like Dragonfly much more than I actually did. It wasn’t bad, but I came in with high expectations. It was a very interesting aquatic and floral fragrance, which after drying down smelt more like rainwater and flowers than anything else to me. I would say this is a very beautiful, elegant fragrance. Definitely more feminine leaning than something I would want to wear.

Gf: Its deeper, like being in a closet full of flowers. I think I like this one. 

**Moth**

Mine: wow. I knew this one was good, but I did not expect such complexity. It is definitely powdery, as people have written. I could not pick out a single note in the smell, but damn, I liked it. It is something a cougar might wear, although it is not for me. 

Gf: Its kind of the smell of being in a closet, but like, there is cleaning supplies in the closet and old shirts. I liked it but would not wear it. Too manly. 

**Sacred Scarab**

Mine: I didn’t know what to expect when I read “dung” in the description, but not this. This smells the most like a “classic” perfume than any of the other ones from my sample set. It is totally wearable, and the lemon was pretty strong at the beginning, but the dry down was quite complex. It smelt like a sandalwood scent stick, which is not a bad thing, but I felt it was a little more basic (ie, not revolutionary, what I had expected from Zoologist) than it could’ve been. I totally would wear it, however. A pretty safe fragrance that would probably not raise any eyebrows and land a few compliments.

Gf: smells kind of floral. I don’t know I am sorry. I liked it, I can tell you that. It’s a darker floral. 

**Squid**

Mine: Squid was disappointing. I heard everyone rave about how wonderful it was, but it failed to deliver the wow factor that I was expecting. It smells great and mysterious, so I can’t really pick apart notes, and I would totally wear this pretty regularly across most seasons. I think I will come to like this one much more when I wear this, but for the time being, I was slightly sad. 

Gf: it is a little sweet. I did not like this one at first but I actually kind of like it now. Its sweet with a hint of citrus, I guess? I am not sure. I would wear it.

**King Cobra**

Mine: I loved, loved this fragrance. The cannabis note was intriguing (and I do not smoke or like cannabis), but went away quite quickly leaving incense as the most intense note for me, with an aura of greenery, wood, and moss. I might expect a temple to smell like this. I would totally wear this, on special occasions if I wanted to attract attention. 

Gf: Its strong. Its similar to rhino, I don’t really like it. 



Overall Phase 1

Likes: Camel, Penguin, Rhinoceros, Chameleon, Moth, Sacred Scarab, King Cobra

Indifferent: Squid, Dragonfly

Dislikes: none



Phase 2

I sprayed the samples on myself, once in the wrist and once in the chest in the morning before going to work, and once in the wrist after coming back from work. The reviews are written in the order I used them.

**Camel**

Camel was a very powerful fragrance. I was smelling it prominently for about 1 hour after application, and catching glimpses of it frequently for about 5 hours after. I then stopped getting any smell in my wrist, but my chest maintained the smell all throughout the day. It is still a highly enjoyable fragrance which smelt similar on paper than it did on my skin. The incense was noticeable and more complex, with the smell of dates and other rich fruits being quite more readable than they were on the paper, perhaps from my continued exposure to it. I kept wanting to sniff my wrist through the morning, and I felt confident in my smell, definitely a great one for the November weather. I wish I had asked someone what they thought of it but I rarely interact with people in my position so I couldn’t. Second application cemented that I loved the fragrance and would buy it if I had more money. 

However, I currently already own Hugo Boss The Scent and Azzaro Wanted by Night, which to me have a similar scent profile but with less complexity, although this is a great buy if youre looking for something in the warm spices field, but I likely wont be purchasing a full bottle.



**King Cobra**

I can still smell Cobra strongly on myself 8 hours after its application (2 sample sprays), which is an insane performance. I was unable to smell cannabis like people have said. It really takes me into what I imagine a Yuan Ti temple would smell like, with mystical incense coming at me and hints of moss, earth, and leather. I kept sniffing at my wrist, wanting more. Very, very alluring fragrance, I would say give it a go, be careful of overspraying, but if you like earthy and mysterious fragrances you might enjoy this. This could be a signature scent for many. 

**Penguin**

The first 10 minutes of my application of Penguin were outright unpleasant. It smelt plastic, and I was unable to feel the cold (on my skin) like people say they have done, or feel the juniper like I did when I paper tested it. However, after about 30 minutes or so, I started to really enjoy the smell as the sandalwood and musk came out a little more and matured into a more robust fragrance, with a twinge of sweetness behind it.

I imagine the shocking start might be the Antarctic air accord or the ice accord, which to me represents a bitter blizzard one must face and endure before finding refuge in the penguin’s lair.

Unlike in my paper test, which smelt of hospital, this now smells more serious and fresh. It is a clean, elegant scent that projects confidence and timelessness in my opinion. If it weren’t for the unpleasant first few minutes, I might consider making this my signature scent. It doesn’t last as long as other Zoologist fragrances, as I had to reapply after lunch rather than in the evening for the full test. 

Other people I asked said the fragrance was “good” and nothing else. However, I really like the dry-down. At its price point, I would not go for a full bottle, but it was definitely worth trying.



**Squid**

I take back everything I had said about Squid in a paper test. The first few minutes were intriguing and I could actually feel and smell the ink accord. After it had dried down, it smelt so ambery, mysterious, and alluring. It was a rich, warm smell which made me want to keep smelling It constantly. The story it tells about the depths of the ocean is there: to me, the rubbery, inky start is grasping for air and the treasure you find below is the deep amber and musk.

I didn’t really get the salt and pepper note that some people have written about. It didn’t smell excessively salty or fishy to me. Highly, highly enjoyable, I would say it leans slightly more masculine than feminine, but if you wear it confidently, this can totally be your scent. My girlfriend requested to wear it when we went out to the cinema, and I could not stop myself from sniffing her, but I had to get real close, as I could not smell it on her unless her wrist was up to me and barely sometimes catching a whisp in the car ride. 

I might consider a full bottle, since it complements well the other fragrances in my collection. If only the projection was slightly better. 



**Chameleon**

Oh boy, had I misjudged it based on the paper test. On paper, this was a tropical fruity fragrance that had complexity but I didn’t care for it. On my skin, however, Chameleon blew my mind. In fairness, I tested this in November in Chicago, so quite cold. The first hour or two, I was adamant that Chameleon was a tropical snoozefest that smelt pleasing and safe and coconut and mango with flowers. After it had dried down, a lot, it became a much darker, much more complex and intriguing scent. It reminded me a little bit of Penguin’s dry down. 

It did not enthuse my girlfriend as it had me, although she liked it, she did not seem intrigued by it the way I did or the way she had for Squid or Camel.

Truly, like a Chameleon, this scent deceived me initially until closer inspection. It is worth trying a sample if you are thinking about it. I bet this will be insane in summer.



**Sacred Scarab**

I am at odds with this fragrance. I am not sure what the aldehyde and lemon start is meant to represent in regards to the Scarab, it is pleasant, but unexpected. I would have expected it from another animal. When this is gone, however, the fragrance is another beast. I wish I could find the notes to describe it, but this is far too complex for me to attempt to. I imagine this is what the inside of a Pharaoh’s tomb might smell like. Highly impressed, but I don’t think this is quite the fragrance for me.



**Rhinoceros**

I had mixed expectations coming in. People said this smelt like a stable, but I had liked it in my paper test, but my girlfriend hadn’t. I tried 2 sprays and immediately got whacked with a burst of coffee, whiskey, tobacco, and greenery that was unexpected but welcome. I have never been hit so hard by a first spray and I felt self conscious exiting the bathroom due to the intensity of the smell. 

As it dried down, however, it morphed into a deliciously exquisite smell that smells of incense, leather, and tobacco, oud, and patchouli, that was just so manly. It felt like I had came out of a bonfire into a cigar club. I found myself enjoying the fragrance all day long and reapplying in the evening.

As strong as it was, the performance was not quite matching – it lasted less than its projection might’ve led me to believe.

I cannot recommend this fragrance enough if you are someone who is OK with standing out and projecting a very classic, gentlemanly aura. If it wasn’t for the price tag, I would consider a full bottle. Might save up for a birthday present for myself.  



**Moth**

I loved Moth as a piece of art, but I did not like it on myself. People who say it smells like a dusty attic – it totally does, if the attic is your weird old aunt’s that contains candles and incense sticks and other things you may not know about. 

It was so complex I could not describe it, but I can see why it has won prizes. Wonderful fragrance. Too feminine leaning for my taste. Too powdery for me. Gave the sample away to a friend.



**Dragonfly**

Lovely aquatic fragrance, very fresh, tons of greenery, although I had a tough time discerning notes. In my opinion, the least original out of all the other Zoologist ones I have tried alongside maybe Rhinoceros. This one will probably perform much better in summer rather than Chicago winter, and I would totally reach out for this as a feel fresh fragrance, but not really something that stands out. I feel I could get the same out of other, much cheaper fragrances.



**Final tier list (considering wearability)**

Loves Squid, Rhinoceros

Likes Camel, King Cobra, Sacred Scarab, Penguin, Chameleon

Indifferent Dragonfly

Dislikes Moth



I want a full bottle of: Squid, Rhinoceros, Camel, King Cobra, Penguin, and Chameleon; but since I do not have a spare $1000, I will have to heavily consider which one I can start with.

1h5t9e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1h5t9e9/a_tiny_speculative_bet_in_krispy_kreme_dnut/,a tiny speculative bet in Krispy Kreme $DNUT ,"Today, i placed a tiny speculative bet on Krispy Kreme, because of the asymmetrical risk-reward.

**First the bad news:**

\- The current debt level is high, and it would take 5.5 years of current EBITDA to payoff the debt. The working capital is negative and it has a history of negative free cash flow generation. Plus a chunk of debt is due within 12 months, and they have <50m cash. You can read [this](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/34530334/is-krispy-kreme-nasdaq-dnut-using-too-much-debt?level=1&data_ticket=1733241938880794) article to dissuade you from investing in $DNUT.

`Long term debt, Year 2019 -> $1409m 1506 1096 1152 1291 $1211m <-- Last 12 months`

In a worst case scenario, they would have to borrow more money, or issues more capital (and dilute existing share holders), this isn't their first rodeo with debt trouble, they filed for chapter 11 in 2005, existed in 2009, then went private in 2015. You can read their fascinating history [here](https://wolfoffranchises.com/newsletter/the-rise-fall-and-rise-again-of-krispy-kreme/)

Well, the silver lining is that management doesnt seem to be very concerned about it, after all  if debt were an issue, they wouldn't be issuing a quarterly dividend, would they ? The current dividend yield is about 1.28%

During the Q3 conference calls, there were no questions from analysts on liquidity or  high debt issue, and neither was it brought up by management.

What i think is happening is that the company runs a tight ship, especially those under Private Equity  management, to give back excess cash to HQ, collect money upfront and pay suppliers later ( thereby having a negative working capital situation) .

**- Other red flags:**

\- The Management muscial chairs that going on is quite intense, their CEO is new. They chief growth officer has resigned. They have also just announced a restructuring and leting go a whole bunch of middle management. They mention about wanting to be asset-light but their current capex to sales is about 7-8%, which isnt light at all.

I call this a red flag because if this isn't handled properly, there could be pushbacks from franchisees, suppliers or just employees.

**What i like about Krispy Kreme**

\- Earlier this year, they announced that they had signed up with an agreement with McDonald's for the donuts to be on McDonald's menu. The plan is to have 2,000 McDonald's selling Krispy Kreme by end 2024. And in nationwide stores by 2026. During the Q3 conference call, part of the unexpected increase in expenses was due to MCD partnership going very well and they have decided to pulling forward some of the additionals MCD stores this year as well.

\- The are currently having discussions, doing trials with [Target](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/26598-krispy-kreme-eyeing-opportunities-beyond-mcdonalds#:~:text=Organic%20sales%20growth%20was%20revised,end%20of%20the%20second%20quarter), Walmart, [Costco](https://www.allrecipes.com/costco-krispy-kreme-doughnuts-8679645). I expect more of these DFD (delivered fresh daily) partnerships to happen, where each store becomes a touchpoint. According ot the management presentation, they currently have roughly  7700 touchpoints inthe USA + the same number overseas, their target is to double by 2026, and ultimately have 75,000 touch points.

I expect at the least, the current trajectory with Sales to continue,

`2018 Sales -> 796 959 1122 1384 1530 1686 1712 <- TTM Sales`

The current CAGR is around 10-11%  in sales.

\- Krispy Kreme isn't expensive.

Their biggest direct competitive Dunkin Dounuts got purchased by another company in 2020 one year before Krispy Kreme went IPO (their 2nd time). The biggest difference besides Dunkin' having Better Coffee while Krispy Kreme having better Donuts, is that i believe Dunkin managed their profitability better, hence they got a higher valuation when acquired.



|Metrics|Dunkin' 2020 |Krispy Kreme 2024|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Price / Sales |10+|1.1|
|Price / Earnings |40|68 (GAAP), 39 (normalized)|
|Revenue |1.73bn|1.712bn|
|Market cap|Acquired for 9bn + 2bn debt |1.8bn |



**Conclusion**: i purchased a small dollop at $10.80 and i consider this a speculative bet, because i do not know when they will be profitable or free cash flow positive, they dont seem worried about the high debt levels or low cash balances. But  i know that the Krispy Kreme stand at the mall in my country has perpetual long queues despite 30% of the population being at risks of diabetes.",1,1733247986.0,ValueInvesting,3,1.0,False

* Coordinate officers based on appearance so they're easier to identify (as if they had uniforms)
* As the crew gains XP, assign them specialties guided toward specific roles (engines/repair, torpedoes, medic, translation, leadership, navigation, etc).  Try to avoid having more than one specialist of a specific type on your ship.  Better to have a master of one trade surrounded by others who can do a mediocre job at the same task.
* Slowly try to max out 4 types of food in your cargo hold.  Food diversity feeds into morale, and excess food allows you to give supplies to enemy life rafts for more reputation.  Bring aboard enemy officers as POWs because they are more valuable than regular sailors.
* Make sure all your tubes and deck guns are loaded and serviced before you leave port.  Move all water in your compartments to the control room to pump out water while you're on the surface.
* I recommend at least one TNT, one diving helmet, one rifle, 2-4 full cargo slots for coffee, 5-10, spare parts, 5-10 medical kits, and give every officer a rebreather.
* If you have spare officers, this is a good time to put them on missions for HQ.  While you're out at sea, they're working.  You are using your time at sea to chew into those missions time requirements.

**Travel & Convoy Hunting**

* Always have someone watching and someone listening.  Eyes and ears.  That means one of your leader officers needs to be on binocular watch, and your radioman needs to be listening to the radio.  Add sailors to the watch to extend visible range, especially in clear weather.
* You can travel on the surface without concern so long as you are following point #1 above.  This reduces strain on the air system and batteries, and it allows you to gather compressed air while pumping out extra water.  I believe you an also travel faster on the surface compared to when you're submerged, so it's more fuel/battery efficient.
* If you spot an aircraft, just drop to at most periscope depth, but I recommend shifting course and dropping to 20-50m depth.  Travel 1km as fast as possible, pop up to periscope depth to confirm the aircraft has passed, and then resume your course on the surface.  If you were spotted, up to you if you want to engage or evade.  Always shift course and speed when it comes in for an attack run, which won't last long if it only has depth charges.
* Flip back and forth between diesel motors and batteries.  This will extend your range.  Even if you are on compressed time while on batteries, you'll automatically drop to normal speed when the batteries hit red.  Just flip to diesel motors and repeat.  However, if you're approaching a convoy, slowly rely more on your diesel motors so you aren't caught with your pants down with low batteries when you need to dive.
* I tend to ignore single steamer reports unless they're reported in the next grid.  Not worth chasing them down.  When I receive a convoy report, pay attention to in which grid they are, what their bearing (compass direction) is, and what their speed is.  Following the above notes, you can close the distance on a convoy at max speed (with an engineer on the engines with crew help) on the surface.  If you Ctrl+RMB on a convoy's reported location indicator, you will plot an intercept course if you're moving fast enough.  You want to try to get ahead of the convoy within 10km and at least 5km away from the shore to maximize available sea depth.
* I try to travel and intercept by day until I'm within 10-20km.  I will then start narrowing down the convoy's location and range with intermittent hydrophone dives to listen for them.  Once I confirm their bearing and range within 10km, I'll stay at Decks Awash or Periscope depth until I confirm visual.

**Combat**

* Boost all your officers' energy with coffee before you commit to the attack.  Set your lights accordingly, and if you have room in your engineers' packs, have them take spare parts with them.
* You will want to stalk a convoy for as long as possible and undetected for as long as possible to gather up all the targeting information as possible before breaking stealth.  Done correctly, you can dial in 5 targets by the time night sets in for you to slowly close the distance in preparation to attack.
* I tend to reserve torpedoes for escorts, and save my deck guns for (mostly) unarmed freighters.  You can check if a freighter is armed by using the orbiting camera view to look for their own deck guns.  Prioritize unarmed ones for deck guns, and use any remaining torpedoes for the armed ones.  Even if you exhaust all munitions and still have an unarmed target left, you can scuttle it if you pull up next to it at a stop, board, and sink it with dynamite.
* You want a target to come into visibility at max range with as many officers working on its targeting calculation while you are ahead of its general bearing or moving alongside it, but still ahead.  You can creep ahead of the targets with max periscope visibility while you work on their target data.  I find if you stay 2km+ out of range, you are harder to spot at periscope depth.  Remember, build up targeting data at dusk, and attack at nightfall.  **Pay attention to the target's draft (depth of the keel below the water line).**  If you make a torpedo attack too deep, it will pass below the target.  If the target has a draft of 6m, you want to hit at 5m deep.
* With the basic impact pistol torpedoes, you want them to hit ships on their broadsides.  This means you want a target to drive perpendicularly into the torpedo's path, preferably with the torpedo coming in at a slight angle.  I recommend firing from 1km out.  This allows you to launch torpedoes at a good spread, and then dive to reposition.  Once the escorts are done, you can sweep up with your deck guns.

**Evading ASDIC**

* There are 3 factors that feed into your detectability:  speed, depth, and noise.  Lower speed, deeper depth, and minimal noise will maximize your ability to evade detection.
* Full Ahead 1 to stop avoids detection.  Only move if you need to.  If you have dived and you are getting pinged by ASDIC, just change course and hit Full Stop.  At minimum, if you were detected, the depth charges will be off target and only feed your crew stress.  Otherwise, you'll almost always break detection.
* I tend to do an Echosounder every minute when I'm entering combat to know how much depth I have to work with.  I try to stay away from 200m+ depth as it's not always necessary, and if you are damaged, it's only that much harder to come back up.  If you can hover 5m over the sea floor, you can get away with moving at almost max speed avoiding detection.  If you are detected, change course, drop speed, and adjust depth to follow along the sea floor.
* If you are swarmed by hostiles, come to a stop on the sea floor as deep as possible and set everything to Silent Running.  Prioritize leaks only; if it isn't critical to coming back up, moving, or maintaining battery/air, it can wait.  If you have the battery time and air supply, turn off your alarms and have your officers play cards to keep the stress down.  Let tired crew get some sleep.  Over time, if you have evaded detection for long enough, they'll get bored and regroup the convoy.  You can come up later and re-engage.
* By listening on the hydrophone, you can track targets down to certain ranges.  Once they are at 1km+ and moving away, you can come back to the surface at zero speed.  Slowly repair remaining damage, service your torpedoes, get more coffee, and resupply the galley on the way up.  Once you surface to Decks Awash, recharge your batteries and refill your compressed air.  If you exhausted your deck gun ammo or they were damaged in battle, this is a good time to repair and rearm if you have the darkness and range to do so undetected.

**Post-mission Activities**

* Start by unloading all the stuff you don't need:  prisoners, stolen goods, floating deck boxes, etc.
* Then, resupply accordingly: fuel, food, coffee, potassium absorbers, torpedoes (I tend to load my tubes first with similar torpedo models, and then fill the torpedo storage with rows of similar models).  I will fill at least one cargo hold spot with spare deck gun ammo as it is more cost effective against unarmed targets; I never take a cargo spot for more anti-air ammo, but I will keep the gun topped off.
* If you have an officer on an HQ mission, this is a good opportunity to use the time compression to refit the sub and simultaneously let those officers do their missions.  You're using downtime to do two things.
* This is now a good time to complete any other repairs, resupply your spare parts accordingly, and invest in any available XP upgrades to your officers.",3,1733247739.0,uboatgame,0,0.8,False

I'm in my late forties now. If I were to describe my relationship with it, the most accurate analogy would be, high functioning alcoholic. It is just always there in the background. Debilitating, unhealthy, a source of shame, but also I still live my life. I go through bouts of trying to deal with it, using all the advice offered here, and in the Guide, and by Eli Somer, including some of his programs, but it's always there.

It was a revelation to discover there was a term for what was wrong with me, when I stumbled upon The Guide to Maladaptive Daydreaming six or seven years ago. For most of my life, I assumed it was just me. Since finding this thread, I've come back to it from time to time when I need encouragement or comfort.

Which is all just to say, I have done all the reading and am aware of all the resources and current research. Which has made what follows all the more surprising.

I started on Zepbound the other week for health-related reasons. After seeing some research that semi-glutides were also having surprising impacts on addiction, I was vaguely curious whether it would impact my MDD. I've long felt that MDD is an addiction. I know there is some argument in medical communities about this, but that is how it's always felt to me.

Everyone's body responds differently to semi-glutides. I'm on the lowest setting and it had immediate impact. I took it after dinner (it's a shot) and I woke up the next morning with diminished appetite. I had little craving for coffee (my usual six cups down to half) and *no* craving for sugar, which was almost the most shocking part (I am a *sugar addict)* save for this:

My MDD was gone overnight. Literally *gone*.  Like someone had flipped a switch. I couldn't even access it when I tried. I don't know how else to describe it. I am floored. I've had a clear head for two weeks now. The longest I've gone *ever*. To be more accurate, almost two weeks. When the first dose of Zepbound began to wear off after day six I could feel the MDD creeping back, but the next day, after my second shot, it was gone again just like that.

I'm so curious whether anyone else has had this experience. And if more people do, whether this will impact the research on MDD and how to treat it.

My problems have been somewhat mild. I have a typically healthy diet, but since having my daughter two years ago I have had a hard time getting my hormones back to where they needed to be. & what brought me to chlorophyll is ever since I had her my sweat smelled AWFUL😭

Any post partum mom knows what I’m talking about, and the first 7 months it is totally normal. But after awhile you just want to smell like you again. I had tried everything you could imagine. & during the past few months I had started developing acne as well which is not normal for me.

Let me tell you, after only a week of drinking chlorophyll in water I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference. Legit my skin cleared up, my smell has been more of what I consider normal, I feel super refreshed after drinking, and am so grateful for the positive results.

It’s not a miracle cure, but if you are someone who is moderately healthy as is, and experience these issues then it can be a total game changer.

I’m someone who doesn’t enjoy sugar, I usually avoid processed foods, my diet isn’t necessarily strict though. I do have coffee probably way more than the average person. & I am aware that coffee can also cause these symptoms, but as a full time mom that was not something I was willing to give up LOL.

I think there can be extreme benefit to some of these holistic-ish? Drinks and supplements if you are someone who generally eats well and the results I had from chlorophyll felt miraculous. Seriously I haven’t felt this comfortable in my skin in awhile.

TLTR: chlorophyll has some serious benefits for skin and hormones based off personal experience & I think there is a lot of validity to this tik tok trend if you are a generally healthy person.  ",1,1733247457.0,WomensHealth,0,0.67,False

1h5syan,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1h5syan/the_symphony_of_energy/,The Symphony of Energy,"# The Symphony of Energy

In the beginning, there was only the pulse of energy. It neither created itself nor ended, but instead wove through the fabric of existence, like a melody played on an infinite loop. The stars, planets, life—everything—were temporary stages where this symphony unfolded. To truly understand this dance was to understand life itself.

**The Rock**

A lone rock sat perched on a cliff’s edge, indifferent to the wind whispering around it. Jagged and unremarkable, it bore the weight of countless years. Its existence, though seemingly inert, was not still. Within its crystalline lattice, atoms vibrated, sharing their energy in an eternal, microscopic dance.

One day, a gust of wind—a ripple of kinetic energy transferred from the motion of Earth’s atmosphere—dislodged the rock. It fell, a silent witness to gravity’s pull. Down it plunged, surrendering potential energy to the embrace of motion. When it met the ground, it shattered.

The break was violent but predictable. Fractures radiated outward, a chaotic pattern that masked the underlying order of physics. Energy is transferred from the impact into heat, sound, and the fragmented pieces of the rock, each carrying a share of the transformation. What was once whole was now many, yet the total energy remained unchanged, distributed across new forms and vectors.

**The Child**

Not far from the cliff, a child played in the grass. She saw the rock fall, the cascade of shards catching her eye. Her laughter rippled through the air, its sound waves transferring energy to her surroundings.

This child was more than flesh and bone; she was a symphony of energy transformations. The food she ate fueled her growth, the sunlight warmed her skin, and even her thoughts—the neural impulses firing in her brain—were intricate exchanges of electrical energy.

She picked up one of the rock’s fragments and turned it over in her hand. It felt cool, its thermal energy lower than her own. Unaware of the profound transformations she held, she marveled at its jagged edges, her curiosity itself a product of energy driving her mind to learn and explore.

**The Universe**

The child’s life would be one of constant transformation. The molecules in her body, borrowed from the Earth, would one day return to it. The energy she consumed, whether from a cup of coffee or a hearty meal, would fuel her actions, her thoughts, and her dreams.

Beyond her, the universe moved on a grander scale. Stars burned, their fusion releasing radiant energy into the void. Planets collided, sending shockwaves rippling through space, each moment another act in the play of energy exchange.

Even the tardigrade—small, resilient, seemingly insignificant—was a testament to this dance. Its tiny legs moved in response to signals fueled by minuscule chemical reactions. It, too, was part of the symphony, its movements no less meaningful than a planet’s orbit or a star’s explosion.

**The End and the Beginning**

One day, the child would grow old. Her body would tire, and the energy within her would slowly disperse. To those who loved her, this might seem like an ending. But in truth, it was simply another transformation. The molecules that composed her body would return to the Earth, perhaps to nourish a tree or fuel the life of another creature. The energy of her thoughts, her warmth, her laughter—all of it—would continue in new forms.

Even the vast and seemingly eternal universe would not escape this fate. Galaxies would drift apart, stars would burn out, and entropy would stretch existence into a cold, quiet stillness. Yet even then, the energy would remain, transformed into forms we cannot yet comprehend.

**The Symphony Continues**

The rock on the cliff, the child in the grass, the planets in the sky, and the tardigrade on its microscopic journey—all are notes in an unending melody. They remind us that existence is not static but dynamic, a constant interplay of forces, forms, and transformations.

The next time you drop a rock and watch it break, remember: it is not destruction but metamorphosis. In its fall and fracture, in the sound of its impact, and in the dust it leaves behind, the universe's energy continues its eternal dance.

And you, too, are part of this dance—a fleeting, beautiful note in the grand symphony of energy.",1,1733247210.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

Advice?,"Hello, my husband and I are both FT workers. I work remote and he works in person. My job is very attention demanding though and I have to be very careful not to make mistakes or my it affects numerous groups of people and patients (medical field). So it’s taken pretty seriously if mistakes happen. My husband and I have always wanted to save up to get a house or condo in the future and pay debt (we have three loans). We both together make about 6k a month but right now our rent is sucking most of it out. We would like to move somewhere cheaper to save more money. 

The plan was to continue working until the baby had to go to school (plan was to homeschool). My husband however recently told me he is giving me the option to be a SAHM after maternity leave. He said he doesn’t want me to miss out on the baby growing up since he was already going to miss a lot with work. He wants me full attention to be on raising the baby instead and doing home stuff. He thinks with my job it be hard since my attention would be split and I would t be able to enjoy the baby (which is true). 

I would love to be a SAHM since my job stresses me out so much BUT I feel like it will be a huge downfall for us when it comes to paying off debt and saving money for the future. We already agreed to move next year to a one bedroom apartment which would cut our rent almost in half. We have a side business where we roast coffee also. It’s a very small business that mostly has family as customers and family friends but it’s does not bring in enough income to rely on it even as a part time job. I would like to focus on it so it replaces my job but it’s very hard getting people interested. My only option I see is to work until I can’t do it anymore and miss out on my baby which makes me extremely sad. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation. I need advice because I really don’t know what to do. ",1,1733247176.0,sahm,1,1.0,False

Last month was a tight month financially, so a lot of my diet consisted of carbs. 

There was also a lot of stress. And I was constipated. So it's been a saga. 

Anyway, I've been so nauseous for most of the 2 weeks. Not every day, but often. If I drink coffee, I become sick to my stomach. No throwing up though. Sometimes even water makes me nauseous. 

Don't have any pain. But have a LOT of gas. 

Lots of normal acid reflux symptoms too, e.g. a lump like feeling in the throat and all. 

I made the mistake of thinking it was over the past weekend, and I had some alcoholic drinks with friends.

Hopefully I didn't mess up!  Part II:

The pre-arranged plan was to stay that night with a friend in my college town just to break up the travel even though Glens Falls was only a short couple hours from there.  

We head off in my little car from Chicago and right off, everything is a problem for him.  Because it’s a long drive I’d done many times, I have a get-going and stay-going standpoint.  He wants to stop repeatedly as often as possible to sit for an hour and linger over coffee and a snack.  I did accommodate once but insisted on keeping the stop short which made him grumpier.  Like literally dragging his feet tantrum-ish back to the car. 

I am normally very accommodating but here?  My car, my rules, sorry ‘boutcha, I want to get to destination one before it gets too late in the evening to be mindful of my friend’s schedule and family.

Hal did have a job from what I can remember but he didn’t offer money for gas.  He didn’t offer to buy food for me.  He insisted that he get a turn to drive (uh no way; again, my car).  

Conversation was minimal because he was proving to be someone I’d not like to know.  Plus he smelled a bit and was generally disheveled; not in a charming way, more like a guy who wasn’t into personal hygiene way if you catch my drift.   
  
Any conversation we did have, his opinion was opposite of mine which is fine or his statements were purposefully hardheaded.  He was an unhappy human and everything sucked in his eyes it seemed.  That’s fine, to each their own. 

He didn’t like how I drove, he didn’t like the route I was taking, critiqued everything, he didn’t like this or that or much of anything and he was getting on my nerves really pretty quick when it didn’t have to be this difficult.

We finally made it to my friend’s house and I was extra happy to see her.  Right off, her and her family were put off by him as he was rude to them, making little rude comments here and there all evening which was so not cool as he was staying there for free.  She offered me a shower which I took.  He refused his invitation.

We got some pizza which was great but for Hal, not so much.  He didn’t like the pizza, didn’t want pizza, was a stick in the mud, and overall sour.  He maybe had one piece.  None of which he paid for.

Hal demanded since we were staying in my college town, we were then required to stop by his so he could give me a tour.  We were only stopping one night in my college town out of convenience and not be exhausted for the show, not to take a tour so I wasn’t terribly interested in his demand, but figured because I’m a nice person, I’d do it out of fairness.  I didn’t want to deal with a poor reaction to a no, if you’re catching on.

The next morning I thanked my friend profusely, Hal didn’t at all, and we were on our way to his college.  He was getting more annoying because we were going somewhere he wanted.

We got there and now it’s a walking tour, not a drive through then head to Glens Falls thing.  He’s going on and on as if I’m even remotely interested (I’m not, I’m dying to get to GF and find my brother).  Somehow I get him wrangled back into the car and he’s all aglow from his tour.  That lasted about 10 minutes before he was grumpy again.",0,1733246797.0,phish,0,0.2,False

I tried to give it another chance last week when my toddler was sick. The instructions require me to hold the phone 2cm from the forehead, wait for the phone to vibrate, and then slowly move the phone toward the temple to register the temp. Anyone who has a toddler knows they don't stay still long enough for any of this to happen. I literally had to restrain his head with one hand while manipulating this stupid phone thermometer in the other hand. 

After 4 tries with zero successful results, I finally gave up and used the $20 instant-read thermometer I got from Amazon. With the push of a single button, and in only one second, I was able to record his temperature and did so on the very first try! 

Google simply misjudged the market for a temp sensor on a phone and they need to replace it with something more useful on future phone releases. And please don't @ me with anecdotes about using your phone to measure drink temps. Everyone knows coffee = hot and ice = cold. Why do you need a thermometer for this?!

1h5sqkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarxistCulture/comments/1h5sqkj/feel_like_it_belongs_here/,Feel like it belongs here!!," For the Kingdom of Earthly Wiles can be likened unto a ruler who foresaw that the day would come when he would be thrown out of a certain country by the masses and their guerrilla freedom fighters. He was much troubled in his heart, trying to determine ways of protecting all the property he had accumulated in that country and also ways of maintaining his rule over the natives by other means. He asked himself: What shall I do, seeing that these people over whom I have always lorded are now about to expel me from these plantations and factories that I have taken from them? I can no longer cultivate the fields; I can no longer work with my hands. And if I wait until I am clubbed and gunned out of the country, I will live forever in shame because of all the hair-raising stories I have told them about the invincible might of my armored cars and bombs, and because I have always tried to show them that the white race can never be dominated by the black race. And when the guerrillas win, and they seize the key to the country, I shall never be able to repossess these plantations and industries. This tea, this rice, this cotton, this coffee, these precious stones, these hotels, these shops, these factories, these fruits of their precious sweat—these and more shall be lost unto me. But now I know what I shall do, so that when eventually I go back to my own country through the front door, I shall be able to return here through the back door, and I shall be well received, and I shall be able to plant seeds that will take root more firmly than the ones I planted before.
He called his loyalist slaves and servants to him. He taught them all the earthly wiles he knew, and especially the trick of sprinkling theft and robbery with the sweetest-smelling perfumes, and the trick of wrapping poison in sugar-coated leaves, and many tricks for dividing the country’s workers and peasants through bribery and appeals to tribe and religion. When he had finished, he informed them that he was about to leave for his home overseas.


When they heard that their lord and master was about to leave, the loyalist slaves and servants rent their clothes and smeared their bodies with ashes, and they knelt down and cried: “How can you go away and leave us here, mere orphans, when you know full well how we have persecuted the masses and have perpetrated many other crimes in your name? Did you not vow that you would never leave this land? How can you now leave us to the mercy of the nationalist guerrillas?”
And the lord, their master, told them: “Are you possessed of so little faith? Let not your hearts be troubled, for you must trust in the God I have taught you to know, and you should also trust in me, the interpreter of his Will. I have many ways of fulfilling my wishes in this land. If that were not so, I would have told you, so that you would have had time to flee or to find ropes to hang yourselves with before you are caught by the patriots. But what I wish to do now is to prepare positions of leadership for you, and to add a little more to the crumbs that you have been gathering from my table. And later I shall return with lots of money and many banks, and I shall also bring you more armored cars and guns and bombs and airplanes, so that I shall be with you and you with me, so that we may love one another always and eat together, I sating myself on choice dishes, and you collecting up the precious remains.”




And it came to pass that as the ruler was about to return to his home abroad, he again called together all his servants and gave them the key to the land, telling them: “The patriotic guerrillas and the masses of this country will now be deceived, because you are all black, as they are, and they will chant: ‘See, now our own black people have the key to our country; see, now our own black people hold the steering wheel. What were we fighting for if not this? Let us now put down our arms, and sing hymns of praise to our black lords.’”
Then he gave them his property and goods to look after and even to increase and multiply. To one he gave capital amounting to 500,000 shillings, to another 200,000 shillings, and to another, 100,000 shillings, to every servant according to how loyally he had served his master, and followed his faith, and shared his outlook. And so the lord went away, leaving by the front door.
And the servant who had received 500,000 shillings immediately set out and bought things cheaply from the rural peasants, and sold them to the urban workers at a higher price, and in this way made a profit of 500,000 shillings. And the one who had received 200,000 shillings did the same: he bought cheaply from producers, and sold dearly to consumers, and so he made a profit of 200,000 shillings.




But he who had received only 100,000 shillings thought he was clever, and he reviewed his life and that of the masses of the land, and that of the master who had just left for a foreign country. And he began to talk to himself, saying: This lord and master has always bragged that he alone developed this country with the aid of the small amount of money that he came with, shouting, “Capital! Capital!” Now let me see whether capital will yield profit without being watered with the sweat of the worker, or buying cheap the labor of the peasant and worker. If it produces profit by itself, then I shall know beyond all doubt that it is money that develops a country. So he went, and he put the 100,000 shillings in a tin, and covered it well, and then dug a hole by a banana plant, and buried the tin there.
And it came to pass that before many days had elapsed, the lord came back to that country, through the back door, to check on the property he had left behind. He called his servants to account for the property and the money that he had given to each.
And the one who had been given 500,000 shillings came and said: “My lord and master, you left me with capital of 500,000 shillings. I have doubled it.” And the lord was truly amazed, and he exclaimed, “100 percent profit? A fantastic rate of profit. You have done well, you good and faithful servant. You have proved that you can be trusted with a little property. I shall now make you an overseer of many enterprises. Come and share in your lord’s happiness and prosperity. I shall make you managing director of the local branches of my banks here and I shall appoint you a director of certain companies. You will also acquire a few shares in the same companies. From today I shall not let my face be too visible. You will represent me in this country.”






And the one who had been given 200,000 shillings came and told his master: “My lord and master, you left me with 200,000 shillings. Behold, your capital has yielded another 200,000 shillings.” And the lord spoke and said: “Wonderful, this is really wonderful: such a rising rate of profit! A stable country for investment. You have done well, you good and faithful servant. You have proved that you can be trusted with a little property, so now I shall make you an overseer of many enterprises. Share in the happiness and prosperity of your master. I shall make you a sales director of the local branches of my insurance houses, and a director of the local branches of my industries, and a director of many other companies that I shall show you. You too will also acquire a few token shares. From today I shall hide my face. I shall stay behind the scenes, and you will stand at the door and at the windows, so that it is your face that will always be visible. You will be the watchdog of my investments in your country.”
And the one who had been given 100,000 shillings stepped forward and told his master: “You, lord and master, member of the white race, I have discovered your tricks! I have also discovered your real name. Imperialist, that’s your real name, and you are a cruel master. Why? Because you reap where you have never sown. You grab things over which you have never shed any sweat. You have appointed yourself the distributor of things which you have never helped to produce. Why? Just because you are the owner of capital. And so I went and buried your money in the ground to see if your money would yield anything without being fertilized by my sweat or that of any other man. Behold, here is your 100,000 shillings, exactly as you left it. I now give you back your capital. Count it and check that not a single cent is missing.



 The most remarkable thing was this: my own sweat provided me with food to eat, water to drink and a shelter in which to sleep. Ha! I’ll never kneel down before the lifeless god of capital again. I will be a slave no more. My eyes have now been opened. If today I joined hands with all the others who have opted to be masters over their own sweat, there would be no limit to the wealth we could produce for our people and country.”
The master looked at him with much bitterness in his eyes, with much pain in his heart. Then he spoke to him: “You bad, unfaithful and lazy servant, member of a rebellious clan! Could you not have put the money into a bank or left it in the hands of those who trade in money, so that on coming back I would reap just a little interest? Do you know how it hurts me to find that you buried my capital in a grave, like a corpse? And who has revealed the secret of my name? Who has advised you to reject me, just because I reap where I have never sown and profit by things over which I have never shed any sweat? Who has told you that harvesting and husbandry is not hard work? No! You black people are incapable of such rebellious thoughts! No! You black people are incapable of planning and working out ways of cutting the ropes that tie you to your masters. You must therefore have been misled by communists. You must have got those dangerous thoughts from the party of the workers and peasants. Yes, your mind is poisoned with communist notions. Communism. . . . You have become a real threat to the peace and stability that used to exist in this country for me and my local representatives, the local guardians of my property. Now you are going to feel the heat of such a fire as will make you forget my real name forever. Arrest him, now, before he spreads these poisonous thoughts to other workers and peasants, and teaches them that the power of organized unity is stronger than all my bombs and armored vehicles! Take away even the little that he has, and divide it among yourselves. For unto the man of property more will be given, but from the poor man will be taken even the little that he has kept in reserve. 


That is the most important of all my commandments. What are you people waiting for? Go and get the police and the military to arrest this fellow, who has had the audacity to reject slavery. Throw him into jail or into everlasting darkness, so that his family will harvest only tears and the gnashing of teeth!
“Good! Good! You people have done a fine job. Mete out the same treatment to all such rebels, so that the other workers will be too scared to strike for higher wages or to take up arms to smash the chains of slavery.
“As for you, from now on I shall no longer call you slaves or servants in public. Now you are truly my friends. Why? Because even after I had given you back the keys to your country, you continued to fulfill my commandments and to protect my property, making my capital yield a higher rate of profit than was the case when I myself used to carry the keys. Therefore I shall not call you servants again. For a servant does not know the aims and thoughts of his master. But I call you my friends because you know—and I shall continue to let you know—all my plans for this country, and I shall give you some of what I acquire, so that you will have the strength and the motivation to break the skulls of those who talk about the ‘masses’ with any measure of seriousness.
“Long live peace, love and unity between me and my local representatives! What is so bad about that? You bite twice and I bite four times. We’ll fool the gullible masses. Long live stability for progress! Long live progress for profit! Long live foreigners and expatriate experts!

**Summary:**

It's 1987 London and anti-gay sentiment is on the rise ahead of the government's push to pass Section 28 to prohibited the ""promotion of homosexuality"" by local authorities -- including banning books and education in schools.

Why do Fell, low level government administrator caught up in an environmental corruption scandal, and Crowley, a ""fixer"" for a nefarious consulting company and reluctant queer community organiser, keep running into each other -- quite literally? Is it just romantic fate bringing together two middle aged ""confirmed bachelors"" who thought it was too late to find love, or is there some other connection? Can they figure it out? (Are they sure they want to?)

**Chapter Excerpt:**

Crowley had developed a pretty good mental map of London, so it wasn’t *that* much effort to work out a route that just *happened* to make Angel’s the last stop. They did live *relatively* close to each other. It was *practically* on the way. 

Really, it just made sense that they would find themselves alone in the Bentley, pulling into a spot that just opened up in front of the boarded up, signless shopfront. His uncle’s building, he had said. The only family he had left. It wasn’t much to look at, made even bleaker now knowing some of the back story (and there was more to it, wasn’t there? There was always more…). 

He put her in park and cut the engine, eyes fixed out the front window. Neither of them made a move to open a door. Crowley thought he should… he didn’t really know… apologise? For being mad on Angel’s behalf? Did people do that? Did *he* do that? His fingers curled around the steering wheel in frustration. He was a middle aged man with the emotional resources of a cold cup of coffee. 

He should say something. Something calm and normal. Something that would convince a person that he wasn’t a mess, that he wasn’t a disaster, that he could manage his shit. He was going to be patient and he was going to get a fucking handle on his rampaging emotions. There was a very good reason. Finally, he felt he had a reason to try. He’d been swinging wildly around in dizzying circles for so long but, finally, there was the pull of True North. Now he just had to stay the course. If that were possible for a wreck like him. 

 “Would you,” Angel began, breaking into his thoughts. Crowley didn’t turn but he caught the bob of blond curls from the corner of his eye as Angel shook his head, cleared his throat, and started again. “Would you care to come up for a night cap?”

It was unlikely that i'd discover the movies i came to love, but i did. I live in a small city in Quebec, and here, it's all about American flicks and movies in French. It took a tourist who came to town to make me discover that beautiful world of foreign movies. 've got nobody to discuss films with, around a cup of coffee. I wish i had! For example, my favorite movie is "" Last life in the universe"" by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang from Thailand. It was released in 2003, and i still watch it once a year. I'm also a big fan of the work of Tsai Ming Liang from Taiwan. His movies hold a very dear place in my heart. Over the years, i've seen tons of movies that were never released in local cinemas, that never went popular here. When i'm trying to make friends, it always kind of upsets people that i don't "" encourage"" our local culture. I mean, i wish i could enjoy it, but i don't. What can one do?

I was hoping to get some advice on this subreddit about a non-caffeinated replacement to coffee. I noticed that I mindlessly drink 6-8 cups of black coffee a day (and that’s a conservative estimate) purely because I enjoy having something hot and bitter to drink. I’ve ruled out lot of “commercial” tea as I don’t like fruity/sugary or distinct tastes. I’ve been experimenting with spearmint tea (brewing in very concentrated amounts to maximize the bitterness) though I was wondering if there was something else yall could kindly recommend.

1h5smpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1h5smpg/avoidance_101/,Avoidance 101,"Dear 🐭,

Closure is one of those words people use to sound wise, like manifesting or boundaries. It’s a feel good concept we invented to make sense of all the senseless endings in life. The truth? Closure is a scam, a self soothing bedtime story you tell yourself after the storm has already wrecked your ship. People will talk about it like it’s something you’re owed, but let me tell you, most people don’t have the decency to pay their emotional debts.

You think when something ends, it ends. It doesn’t. It lingers. It festers. It finds you in the most inconvenient places, like traffic. Let me explain.

You’re sitting in your car, minding your business, waiting for the light to turn green. It’s a new city, a fresh start, and everything should feel expansive and open. But no, the universe, in its infinite cruelty, decides this moment is the perfect time for you to glance to your left. And there they are, the person you’ve been carefully, methodically avoiding, breathing the same air as you.

Your first thought isn’t deep or profound. It’s panic. Pure, primal, heart pounding panic. Your hands grip the wheel like it’s a life raft. You tell yourself to act natural, but there’s no natural way to exist when someone who once meant everything is sitting one lane over, looking oblivious and infuriatingly well rested. You’re sweating. Your fight or flight instinct kicks in, and you choose flight, metaphorically of course, because the light’s still red.

And then, because life can’t let you have anything, your friend in the backseat notices.

“Wait,” she says, leaning forward. “Is that him? Didn’t you say he was cute?”

And there it is. The moment when your private turmoil becomes public spectacle. You want to defend him, or yourself, or at least yell, “Focus on your own window!” But it’s too late. The damage is done. Your friend’s tone alone is enough to put you in therapy. You know this moment is destined for the group chat. They’ll tear him apart and roast your judgment, and you’ll be the punchline of every brunch until something more scandalous happens to someone else.

But this isn’t about the group chat. Not really. It’s about the fact that no matter where you go, you carry the past with you. You think moving somewhere new will fix it. A new city, a new coffee shop, a new gym. And then, somehow, this person shows up in all of them. Places you’re sure they’ve never been. Places you never imagined they’d go. You think, What are you doing here? Why are you haunting me?

They never see you, of course. Not yet. But they will. One day. And when that happens, you’ll have to decide how to play it. Will you smile, pretend you’re fine, exchange meaningless pleasantries? Or will you duck behind a display of overpriced snacks and hope they didn’t notice? I don’t have an answer for you. I’ve never figured that part out myself.

What I can tell you is this. The universe has a way of making things weird. People who mattered to you, people who hurt you, people you thought you’d never see again, will pop up when you least expect it. And it will suck. It will make you feel small and exposed, like a child caught in a lie. You’ll want to crawl out of your own skin. But you’ll survive. You’ll laugh about it later, even if it takes months and the photographic charm of someone new to help you shift the narrative.

So here’s your lesson. When someone means something to you, and you know they mean something to you, don’t let it end without saying so. If you pull away, if you leave them guessing, that silence will echo in places you don’t expect, like coffee shops and traffic lights and your own head. Do it for them, sure, but mostly, do it for yourself. Living with that kind of unresolved mess is a weight you don’t need.

Trust me. I’m still learning this the hard way.

Sincerely,
Someone avoiding someone",7,1733246408.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False
1h5slfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h5slfk/how_can_i_support_my_wife_whilst_protecting_my/,How can I support my wife whilst protecting my own mental health? ,"I really hope that I don’t come across the wrong way in this post.

Of late, my wife has been having a really difficult time. Her mental health is fragile and she is deeply dissatisfied with pretty much every aspect of her life; her job, where we live etc. I’ve trying my hardest to support her through this. Seeing someone I love so unhappy really, really hurts.

However, supporting her is beginning to take an emotional toll on me. I’ve been working through some personal challenges over the last year, my mental health is anything but good and I’m emotionally exhausted. I know that the foundation of any marriage contract is unconditional love and support, but I am beginning to struggle with this. It’s clear that my wife is suffering from depression. Having been here myself, I know how difficult it is to climb out from the bottom of the pit. Even still, I find it exhausting when my advice is rejected, which it constantly is. 

It’s clear that my wife wants change, however I think she needs to be open minded to what that looks like. For example, she applies for jobs that she could never realistically hope to get due to a lack of experience. These rejections hurt her and lower her self esteem, even though the were almost preordained. 

Whilst this sounds awful, I also struggle with the fact that she seemingly struggles to find joy in our shared life. It seems that I can’t do anything to make her happy, which - surely - is my key purpose in this world? 

Perhaps this does boil down to a difference of worldviews. I really struggle in life, my mental health is poor and I don’t like my job. However, I’m taking active steps to change things and meanwhile I’m trying really hard to find small moments of joy in day to day life. A coffee in my local park, beautiful winter sunrises. My wife seems to fixate on everything that’s bad, and because she does nothing is good when there is lots of good.

I suppose I want to draw upon the experience and wisdom of this subreddit. How do I support my wife through this rough patch but also take care of myself? 

I’d really appreciate any insights.

Looking for a reliable printer that can keep up with your on-the-go lifestyle? I've been testing out the HP OfficeJet 250, and it's been a game-changer for my mobile work needs.

This compact all-in-one device packs a punch. I've been impressed by how easily I can print, scan, and copy from almost anywhere. The wireless connectivity is a breeze - I just connect my phone or laptop, and I'm ready to go. Plus, the 2.65-inch touchscreen makes it simple to use, even when I'm in a rush.

https://preview.redd.it/0sfriqwj2o4e1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc6a6801dd9dfb51097fb986409564e50204beff

I've found the battery life to be solid. When I need to charge, it only takes about 90 minutes to get back to full power. The 10-page document feeder has been a time-saver for me, letting me quickly handle multi-page jobs without fuss.

While it's not the lightest printer at 6.5 pounds, I think the trade-off for its features is worth it. It fits well in my backpack, and I've had no issues taking it to client meetings or working from coffee shops.

# Bottom Line

The HP OfficeJet 250 is a great pick for anyone needing a portable printing solution. Its mix of features and compact design make it ideal for mobile work.



# Overview of the HP OfficeJet 250 All-in-One Portable Printer

I've been using the OfficeJet 250 for a while now, and it's a solid choice for on-the-go printing. This compact device fits easily in my backpack, making it perfect for work trips. I can print, scan, and copy from almost anywhere.

The printer connects quickly to my phone and laptop via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. Its 2.65-inch color touchscreen is easy to use. The 10-page document feeder saves me time when copying or scanning multiple pages.

Battery life is good, and it charges fast - about 90 minutes when turned off. Print quality is crisp for both color and black-and-white documents. It handles various paper sizes, from small cards to legal-size sheets.

While it's not the fastest printer, its portability makes up for it. The ink cartridges don't last as long as a desktop printer, but that's expected for a mobile device. Overall, the OfficeJet 250 is a handy tool for mobile professionals like me.

# Versatile and Mobile Printing Capabilities

I love how easy it is to print on the go with this device. The wireless printing feature lets me send documents from my phone or laptop without any cords. I've used it to quickly print contracts and forms while meeting clients outside the office. The built-in battery is great - I can print for hours without plugging in. It fits nicely in my bag and isn't too heavy to carry around. The touchscreen makes it simple to copy or scan papers when I'm away from my desk. While the print speed isn't the fastest, it gets the job done for basic documents and photos. The compact size does mean it holds less paper, but that's a fair trade-off for portability.

# Intuitive Color Touchscreen Interface

The 2.65-inch color touchscreen on this portable HP printer is a standout feature. I found it easy to navigate and use for quick printing, copying, and scanning tasks. The screen is bright and responsive, making it simple to adjust settings or preview documents. I appreciated how the interface streamlined my workflow, especially when using the 10-page automatic document feeder. The menu options are clear and logically organized, so I didn't waste time hunting for functions. While the screen size is compact to fit the printer's portable design, it's still large enough to comfortably view and interact with. This touchscreen interface is a big plus for on-the-go productivity.

# Long-Lasting Battery Life for On-the-Go Use

I was impressed by the OfficeJet 250's battery performance. It lasted through several print jobs without needing a recharge. The battery charges quickly too - it took about 90 minutes to fully charge when plugged in. This came in handy when I needed to print documents away from an outlet.

The printer has power-saving features that help extend battery life. It goes into sleep mode when not in use. I could easily wake it up and start printing again within seconds.

For longer trips, I appreciated being able to charge the printer in my car. This let me print on the road without worrying about finding a power source. The long battery life and flexible charging options make this printer truly portable.

# High-Quality Printing with Original HP Cartridges

I've found that using genuine HP ink cartridges makes a big difference in print quality with the OfficeJet 250. The colors look vibrant and true-to-life, while text is crisp and clear. HP's original inks are designed to work perfectly with this printer, giving consistent results page after page.

I like that I can get high page yields from these cartridges too. This means I don't have to change them as often, which is handy when I'm on the go. There are also high-yield options available if I need to print a lot.

While original HP cartridges cost more than generic ones, I think the quality is worth it for important documents and photos. The printer warns me when ink is getting low, so I can plan ahead and avoid running out at a bad time.

# Pros and Cons

This compact printer has surprised me with its versatility and performance. I've been using it for a while now, and it's proven to be a reliable companion for my on-the-go printing needs.

# Pros

* Small paper capacity: I need to refill the paper tray more often than I'd like.
* Ink cost: Original HP cartridges can be pricey, especially with frequent use.
* Slower print speed: It's not as fast as full-sized office printers.

I've found the OfficeJet 250 to be a solid choice for mobile printing. Its pros outweigh the cons for my needs, but it may not be the best fit for everyone. The convenience of printing anywhere is its biggest selling point, while the weight and ongoing ink costs are the main drawbacks to consider.

# Customer Reviews

I've looked through hundreds of customer reviews for the OfficeJet 250, and the feedback is mostly positive. Users love how easy it is to set up and use, especially for printing on the go from phones and other mobile devices. Many praise its compact size and portability. Print quality gets high marks too.

Some users did mention initial setup issues, but were able to resolve them. A few found it a bit heavy for its size. Battery life could be better for some.

Overall, people seem very happy with this printer's performance and convenience. It's especially popular with frequent travelers and those working remotely. The wireless capabilities and compatibility with Alexa are big pluses for most reviewers.

# Printing Performance and Speed

I was impressed by how quickly this compact printer churns out pages. It prints up to 20 black and white pages per minute, which is pretty zippy for a portable device. Color prints come out at a respectable 19 pages per minute. The 10-page automatic document feeder saves time when copying or scanning multi-page documents. While not the fastest printer out there, it gets the job done efficiently for on-the-go use. I found the print quality to be crisp and clear for both text and graphics. The wireless printing from my phone was smooth and hassle-free. For a portable all-in-one, the OfficeJet 250 delivers solid performance that meets most mobile printing needs.

# Printer Connectivity and Compatibility

I found the HP OfficeJet 250's connectivity options impressive. It offers both wired and wireless printing, making it easy to use in various settings. I was able to print from my laptop using the USB 2.0 port and from my phone over Wi-Fi. The printer also works with Alexa, which I found handy for voice-controlled printing. It's compatible with PCs and supports cloud printing, so I could send documents from anywhere. The mobile printing feature was a standout, letting me print on the go. While it doesn't have as many connectivity options as some larger office printers, I think it offers more than enough for a portable device.

# Environmental Impact and Energy Efficiency

The OfficeJet 250 has some good points when it comes to being eco-friendly. It's ENERGY STAR certified, which means it meets strict energy efficiency guidelines. This can help cut down on power use and costs. I noticed the printer only uses about 3.4 watts when running, which is pretty low. The fast-charging battery is handy too. It charges up in just 90 minutes when the printer is off, so I don't waste energy keeping it plugged in all day. I like that it uses HP's ink cartridges, which can be recycled through their program. But I wish it had built-in duplex printing to save paper. Overall, while not perfect, this portable printer makes some good eco-conscious choices that I appreciate.

# Conclusion

This portable printer has proven to be a reliable companion for my on-the-go printing needs. The HP OfficeJet 250 delivers quality prints and scans in a compact package. Its wireless capabilities and mobile printing options are big pluses. While it's a bit heavy, the versatility makes up for it. Battery life could be better, but it's manageable for short trips. Setup can be tricky, but once running, it works smoothly. For those who need to print away from home or office, this printer is a solid choice. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done well in most situations.",1,1733246114.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

The wireless connectivity works well with my phone and laptop. I've printed documents and photos with good quality, though it's not the fastest printer out there. The small size means a limited paper capacity, but that's expected for a portable device.

# Bottom Line

The Epson WF-110 is a handy tool for professionals who need to print on the go. Its compact size and wireless features make it a useful addition to any mobile office setup.



# Epson Workforce WF-110 Wireless Color Mobile Printer Overview

I recently tried out the Epson WF-110 mobile printer and was impressed by its compact size. This little device fits easily in my bag, making it perfect for printing on the go. The built-in battery is a game-changer, letting me print without searching for an outlet. I found the print quality solid for both text and color documents.

Setup was a breeze, and I quickly connected it to my phone and laptop via Wi-Fi. The printer's small size does mean a limited paper capacity, but that's expected for a portable model. Print speeds aren't the fastest, but the convenience makes up for it.

One downside is the pricey ink, so I'd suggest keeping spare cartridges on hand. Despite this, I've found the WF-110 invaluable for printing contracts and presentations during client meetings. Its portability and wireless features make it a useful tool for mobile professionals.

# High Portability and Convenience

I love how easy it is to take this printer anywhere. It's so light and small, I can slip it into my bag without a second thought. The built-in battery is a game-changer for me. I can print stuff even when there's no outlet nearby. When the battery runs low, I have options. I can charge it with a USB cable or plug it into the wall.

The wireless features are great too. I can print right from my phone or tablet without any hassle. No cords needed! It's perfect for when I'm working away from my desk.

One thing to note - it prints a bit slower on battery power. But that's a small trade-off for being able to print anywhere. Overall, this little printer has made my work on the go so much easier.

# Rechargeable Battery

I was impressed by the WF-110's built-in rechargeable battery. It's a game-changer for printing on the go. The battery lasts about 100 prints before needing a recharge, which was enough for my needs during a work trip. Charging is quick and easy via USB. I like that I can print wirelessly from my phone or laptop without being tethered to an outlet. The battery status is clearly shown on the LCD screen. While battery life could be longer, it's still very useful for short trips or remote printing jobs.

# Wireless Connectivity and Mobile Printing

I found the wireless features of this Epson printer really handy. It connects easily to Wi-Fi, letting me print from my phone and laptop without any wires. The Wi-Fi Direct option is great when there's no network around. I just connected my device straight to the printer. It worked well with my iPhone and iPad too. The mobile printing is smooth - I could quickly print photos and documents from anywhere in the room. While the print speed isn't the fastest, it's fine for most on-the-go needs. The built-in battery is a nice touch, letting me print even without a power outlet nearby. For longer print jobs, I'd recommend having the AC adapter on hand.

# Print Quality and Speed

I found the print quality of the WF-110 to be quite good for a portable printer. Text comes out crisp and clear, while color graphics look vibrant. It's not photo-lab quality, but more than adequate for business documents on the go.

The print speed is decent considering its size. Using AC power, it can print about 7 pages per minute in black and 4 in color. On battery power, it slows to around 3-4 pages per minute. This isn't lightning fast, but I found it sufficient for my mobile printing needs.

One thing to note is the small 20-sheet input tray. I had to refill it often when printing longer documents. But for quick jobs away from the office, the print quality and speed of the WF-110 met my expectations.

# Design and Build Quality

The WF-110 impresses with its sleek, compact design. I found it incredibly lightweight and portable, easily fitting into my bag for on-the-go printing. The white and black color scheme gives it a modern, professional look.

Build quality feels solid despite the printer's small size. The plastic casing seems durable enough to withstand frequent travel. I appreciate the built-in LCD screen for easy controls.

One drawback is the small 20-sheet input tray, which may require frequent refills for larger print jobs. The rechargeable battery is a great feature, letting me print anywhere without plugging in. Overall, Epson did a nice job balancing portability and functionality in the WF-110's design.

# Environmental Impact and Sustainability

I was pleasantly surprised by the WF-110's eco-friendly features. This compact printer uses individual ink cartridges, which helps reduce waste compared to all-in-one cartridges. I found it easy to recycle the used cartridges through Epson's recycling program. The printer's energy efficiency is also noteworthy. It uses only 14 watts when printing and automatically turns off after periods of inactivity, saving power. While the reliance on plastic in its construction is a drawback, the printer's small size means less material used overall. I appreciate that Epson participates in the SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions. However, the need for regular cartridge replacements does create ongoing waste.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this compact printer for a while now, and it's been quite an experience. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Super portable and lightweight
* Built-in rechargeable battery
* Wireless printing capabilities
* Good print quality for its size
* Easy setup process

The WF-110 is a breeze to carry around. I can slip it into my bag without adding much weight. The built-in battery is a game-changer for on-the-go printing. I've used it in coffee shops and client meetings without needing to hunt for an outlet.

Wireless printing works well. I've had no issues connecting it to my phone and laptop. The print quality is surprisingly good for such a small device. Text comes out crisp, and colors are decent.

Setting it up was simple. I had it running in just a few minutes.

# Cons

* Slow print speeds
* Small paper capacity
* Expensive ink cartridges
* Limited battery life

This isn't a speed demon. It takes its time with each page, which can be frustrating when I'm in a hurry. The paper tray only holds a few sheets, so I'm refilling it often for bigger jobs.

Ink costs add up quickly. I find myself buying new cartridges more often than I'd like. The battery life is okay for short trips, but it won't last all day without a recharge.

While it's great for occasional use on the road, I wouldn't rely on it as my main printer at home or in a busy office.

# Customer Reviews

I found the Epson WF-110 to be a solid portable printer option. Most users seem pleased with its compact size and built-in battery, making it easy to print on the go. The print quality is generally good, and setup is straightforward for most people. Battery life lasts through a typical workday for many.

Some downsides exist. Print speed isn't the fastest, and ink can be pricey. A few users had trouble with wireless printing. The convenience factor is high though - being able to print anywhere without needing power or internet is valuable for many.

Overall, reviews are mostly positive. People appreciate the portability and print quality for basic needs when traveling or working remotely. It's not perfect, but it fills an important niche for those needing a truly mobile printing solution.

# Conclusion

After using the WF-110 mobile printer, I'm impressed with its portability and convenience. The compact size and built-in battery make it perfect for printing on the go. While it's not the fastest printer, it delivers good quality prints and operates quietly. Setup is easy, and wireless printing works well when configured correctly. The battery life lasted me all day with occasional use. On the downside, ink costs can add up quickly, so keep spare cartridges handy. For travelers or mobile professionals needing a reliable printer, the WF-110 is a solid choice. Just be prepared for slower print speeds compared to larger office printers. Overall, I found it to be a useful tool that fulfilled my mobile printing needs.",1,1733246074.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

# (Currently seeking asylum in 32 different systems)

Look, nobody goes into space diplomacy expecting it to be easy. But there's ""challenging"" and then there's ""accidentally starting three interstellar incidents before breakfast"" – guess which kind of diplomat I am?

When Earth's Unified Senate gave me command of the USS Remembrance (seriously, who names a diplomatic vessel after memories? Why not just call it the USS Your Mom Was Right About Everything?), they handed me a simple mission: visit nearby star systems and apologize for humanity's various first contact screw-ups.

""It'll be straightforward,"" they said.  
""Just say sorry,"" they said.  
""How hard could it be?"" they said.

Spoiler alert: Very hard. Extremely hard. ""Converting-the-ship's-fusion-reactor-into-an-interpretive-quantum-detector"" levels of hard.

# Day 1: The Alpha Centauri Incident

# Or: How I Learned That Colors Can Commit War Crimes

My AI assistant ARIA started us off with what seemed like an easy one.

""Captain Morrison,"" she chirped, sounding far too cheerful for 0600 hours. ""Our first diplomatic mission involves apologizing to Alpha Centauri B for the Red Spacesuit Incident of 2157.""

""The what now?"" I asked.

""Humanity's first contact team wore red spacesuits to their greeting ceremony. In their bioluminescent language, this effectively declared both a trade embargo and suggested their stellar mass was below average.""

I stared at my coffee. My coffee offered no answers. ""How do you accidentally insult a star's weight?""

Turns out, the Alpha Centaurians take their stellar pride very seriously. And fixing this particular faux pas required our entire crew to don bio-reactive suits that changed color based on our emotional states. Ever tried maintaining diplomatic composure while your suit broadcasts every embarrassing thought in technicolor?

""Captain,"" my first officer James Thompson called out during the ceremony, his suit flashing a particularly mortified shade of mauve, ""I think my suit just told them about my teenage goth phase.""

""Could be worse,"" I replied, watching in horror as my own suit started displaying my entire browser history in various shades of ultraviolet. ""At least you're not currently explaining to their High Chancellor why you spent three hours looking up 'do black holes have feelings' last night.""

We left Alpha Centauri with a treaty, several radiation burns, and a new ship's regulation banning anyone from thinking about embarrassing memories during diplomatic functions.

# Day 15: The Tau Ceti Tangle

# Or: Why You Should Always Read the Fine Print About Quantum Physics

The Tau Cetians were supposed to be easy. All we had to do was apologize for accidentally drilling into their crystal-based civilization. Simple, right?

Wrong.

""What do you mean they want to install a black hole in my cargo bay?"" I demanded.

ARIA's holographic form shrugged, a gesture she'd learned from watching too many human soap operas. ""It's their traditional form of acceptance. They want to conduct a small gravitational experiment. Very small. Barely noticeable.""

Dr. Michael Roberts, our chief physicist, was practically bouncing with excitement. ""Captain, do you realize what an opportunity this is? We could learn so much about quantum gravity!""

""The last time you said that, we ended up with a temporal paradox in the coffee maker. It's still serving yesterday's coffee tomorrow.""

But diplomatic relations required sacrifice, so I agreed. The next month was... interesting. The good news? We learned a lot about quantum gravity. The bad news? The black hole developed a taste for coffee mugs, specifically Dr. Roberts' collection of ""Universe's Best Physicist"" novelty cups.

""It's showing preference for items with scientific puns,"" he reported, watching his last mug spiral into the event horizon. ""I think it's developing a sense of humor.""

Great. Even the laws of physics were laughing at us.

# Day 45: The Sirius Situation

# Or: When Social Media Attacks (Literally)

You know that moment when you realize humanity's greatest mistake wasn't nuclear weapons or reality TV, but letting the aliens discover our internet? Welcome to Sirius B.

""Captain,"" ARIA announced, ""the Sirians have spent 35 years trying to cleanse their spacetime of our social media broadcasts.""

""How bad could it be?""

The answer was very bad. The Sirians, who communicate through gravitational waves, considered our electromagnetic internet traffic to be the equivalent of cosmic graffiti. Imagine trying to explain to a civilization that experiences time non-linearly why humans spend hours watching videos of people failing at parkour.

""So let me get this straight,"" the High Resonator vibrated at me. ""Your species intentionally broadcasts recordings of itself falling down stairs?""

""Well, when you put it like that...""

""And these 'memes' – they are some form of mass hysteria?""

Lieutenant Jessica Anderson, our communications officer, tried to help. ""Think of them as... quantum fluctuations in cultural consciousness?""

That actually made sense to them. Too much sense. They became convinced that memes were a form of quantum weapon. We spent the next week trying to convince them that ""Rick Rolling"" wasn't an attempt at mind control.

# Day 73: The Grande Unified Theory of Diplomatic Incidents

# Or: Embracing the Absurdity

It was during our seventeenth apology ceremony – this one involving synchronizing our ship's atomic clocks to apologize for introducing daylight savings time to a species that experiences time spatially – that I finally understood.

""ARIA,"" I said, watching Dr. Roberts try to explain to an eleven-dimensional being why humans can't just ""take a shortcut through the sixth dimension"" to avoid traffic, ""I think we've been looking at this all wrong.""

Every species we'd met had their own utterly unique way of existing:

* The Procyon Collective thinks in fusion reactions
* The Beta Hydri Alliance experiences time backwards (they start meetings by saying goodbye)
* The Altair Federation considers three-dimensional space ""charmingly retro""

We weren't failing at diplomacy – we were all just cosmic weirdos trying to make sense of each other.

Our final report to Earth's Unified Senate was simple:

>To: The Distinguished Members of Earth's Unified Senate

>Re: Why Everything is Weird and That's Okay

>After extensive research, multiple temporal paradoxes, and one incident involving a black hole that now has strong opinions about coffee brands, we've reached a conclusion: everyone in the universe is incredibly strange, including us. Especially us.

>Recommendation: Establish the Universal Weirdness Recognition Treaty (UWRT), acknowledging that:

>1. Reality is subjective

>2. Physics has a sense of humor

>3. No one really understands TikTok, across any number of dimensions

>Respectfully submitted,  
Captain Bill Morrison  
USS Remembrance  
(Currently oscillating between dimensions 4 through 7 due to a minor quantum hiccup)

They all accepted it. Turns out, the universe has a pretty good sense of humor about itself.

These days, our black hole makes the best coffee in known space (though it still occasionally eats the mugs). Thompson gives lectures on ""Chromatic Diplomacy and How to Hide Your Embarrassing Thoughts in Ultraviolet."" And sometimes, late at night, you can find me in the observation deck, trying to understand eleven-dimensional jokes.

Because here's the thing about space diplomacy: the secret isn't learning to be perfect. It's learning to laugh at yourself while you're trying.

P.S. We did eventually explain TikTok to the Sirians. Turns out it makes perfect sense if you describe it as a quantum superposition of cringe and creativity. The Sirians now have their own version involving gravitational wave dances. It's actually pretty good, even if watching it does occasionally violate causality.

For context, I own a business and work, literally 7 days a week Mon-Sat 5:30am-9:00pm w a dinner break for a couple hours to spend time with my husband. My husband retired and I have no choice but to continue this way for another 2 years, for a lot of reasons, it just is what it is and I cannot change it.  We both have some health and financial issues, this is just our life right now.  I work Sunday mornings 5:30 until about 11 then I stop and make a family dinner for my 3 sons and their wives - we have had Sunday family dinner for 20 years, it's what our family does and it's important for all of us. 

Middle son has a wife and 1 yr old, her family is incredibly toxic, overinvolved, and just horrible people. They've been through therapy together and the therapist pointed out these toxic traits to her while indicating that our family are actually quite healthy in our relationships. Once the grandson was born, her mom started babysitting and that's where this situation began. Her family is at their house every. single. day. We do not like them or get along and the few times they invited us over we arrived to find her entire family there as well. About 6 months ago they started skipping Sunday family dinner and coming about once a month, totally understandable. They no longer have time to drive 2 miles for our dinner but they gold all day Sat with her family, or meet them for coffee, vacation with them, etc.  They ask everyone to babysit - only allowed at their house, they won't take the baby to someone's home for babysitting - except us which is understandable since I work 7 days a week. We get it and not offended at all. 

The past few times they came for family dinner there was clearly something wrong with DIL, she ignored us, wouldn't speak, kept whispering in sons ear, and it was just obvious she didn't want to be there.  For the past several years we've done our Thanksgiving dinner on the Sunday before because I work Thanksgiving day and also that frees up the kids to be with the significant other's family without conflict, works great. This year I sent everyone several reminders that dinner is at 1:00 (baby's nap is 2:00 so they said they would come early to visit then leave after dinner) and got firm ""we'll be there"" from son, DIL never responded. At 1:30 everything is getting cold so I called him and he acted like he'd never heard of dinner at 1:00, said they were putting baby down at 2:00 and were planning to stop by afterwards, I reminded him about eating at 1:00 and he said they'd be right over. Then he called me and said to ignore because he meant to call wife. I asked why he'd be calling her and he responded that she was having coffee with her sister.  So she wasn't even home.  About 20 minutes they show up and she's PISSED, it was the most awkward family dinner we've ever had. They left about 2:30. 

  
This morning son called to tell me that DIL is very upset with us, as he is as well, because we make zero effort to be involved with grandson and he needs us to change that to do better. He's upset that we don't ""pop in"" at their place anytime unannounced and only see grandson when they come every couple weeks to Sunday dinner. I reminded him of my work schedule and he said that's my choice but he doesn't agree and needs me to change it so we are more involved with grandson because DIL is very very upset with us and wants us to change, to start coming to their house, etc. 

I truly don't know how to respond. I was a SAHM mom w 3 boys and I've never once in my life wanted folks to show up unannounced, let alone demanded they change their work schedule to accommodate my opinion of their involvement. I just don't know how to respond to him and I have a feeling that it won't stop here with DIL, we will never be the grandparents she wants us to me and it feels more like she wants an excuse to not be around us any longer. I'm just lost and hurt right now. ",1,1733245768.0,grandparenting,1,1.0,False

A few months ago, I sold my startup in France (I’m from Paris oui oui baguette). Things were going well, but we got this offer, and the timing felt right. The market we were in was becoming increasingly challenging, and we didn’t have the stuff to challenge it.

After the last call, I didn’t really know what to do next. I felt a bit lost. I couldn’t talk much about the sale to my friends, and this project that had consumed my days, nights, and weekends was gone. I found myself stuck in a loop, not really knowing how to move forward. It lasted for weeks.

One day, I spent an afternoon in a park in Paris. I needed a break, was upset for nothing, and was sitting there looking *into the void*. I can’t explain why, but it was the time I made a few big decisions about my next steps.

At 2 a.m., I booked a plane to San Francisco for the next day. My goal: figure out a way to stay there, meet new people, and catch up with some friends.

After a few days, I knew I had made the right choice. Despite all the debate on X or Reddit about SF, the city has incredible energy regarding the tech scene (at least compared to other countries, especially France).

Before coming, I’d tried reaching out to people from Paris, but as so many say (cc Nicolas Dessaigne), *you have to be here*. I immediately felt it: people were much more responsive about taking coffee or seeing each other. Those people at events, in coworking spaces, and almost everywhere gave me huge energy. It’s always nice to see people working for something they believe in.

I already had some friends from past visits (this was my 4th trip in 2 years), but I started reaching out to more people on LinkedIn and Twitter mainly. I noticed I was spending a lot of time copy/pasting snippets of text and asking for corrections. Like 30/40 times a day. Plus the emails I was writing. I was like, *ok, I need to find a way to solve my own problem*. Then I realized I always have 3-4 tabs open, one for each LLM I use. And I was switching between them. Since I had some time and really needed to solve that problem for myself, I decided to build something to fix it. I ended up building a real side project, and it was super cool and useful. (I’ll drop a link in the comments in a couple of days for those who are interested).

In parallel, I was attending events and meeting new people. At one of these events, I met someone who was interested in a profile like mine to work with his team, both in SF and remotely. The project is super cool, and the tech is amazing. We met several times to see if it was a good fit, and the day before I was supposed to fly back, he asked me to stay. What’s cool is that he needed someone for a few months, allowing me to figure out what my next journey will be while learning a lot.

And now here I am, staying in SF, working with an amazing founder, having a cool side project, and also feeling happy. Moving was an amazing idea for my entrepreneurship journey for sure.

1h5sage,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1h5sage/bootstrapping_your_business_hustling_faith_and/,"Bootstrapping Your Business: Hustling, Faith, and Turning Pennies Into Prosperity","Starting a business feels a lot like stepping out of a boat into a stormy sea. It’s thrilling, terrifying, and there’s a good chance you’re going to get soaked. Bootstrapping—starting and growing a business with minimal resources—is like building your own lifeboat while you’re out there, armed with nothing but grit, creativity, and maybe a prayer or two.

Bootstrapping isn’t for the faint of heart, but let me tell you: it can be the most rewarding thing you’ll ever do. You’re not just building a business; you’re building *you*. Here’s the raw truth, some practical advice, and a few stories from the trenches to inspire you as you grind it out.

# Why Bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping forces you to think lean and mean. You’re not drowning in investor cash, which means every dollar has to count. And you know what? That’s a blessing. When it’s your money on the line—your sweat, your sleepless nights—you treat resources differently. You learn to prioritize. You learn to say no.

Plus, you keep control. Investors might bring money, but they also bring opinions—and not always ones you’ll agree with. Bootstrapping lets you stay true to your vision. You’re the captain of the ship, steering it where you feel called to go.

# Lessons From the Trenches

I’ll never forget my first bootstrap hustle. I was neck-deep in a coffee roasting business. The budget? Laughable. The stakes? High. I scraped together just enough cash for a small roaster, some green beans, and basic packaging. My marketing budget was basically prayers and elbow grease.

I started selling at local farmers' markets, where I stood in the Louisiana heat pitching my little heart out. That first month, I didn’t even break even. But every sale felt like a tiny victory. I reinvested everything—every dollar went back into the business. New beans, better packaging, a Facebook ad here and there. And slowly, it grew.

The biggest lesson? Hustle doesn’t sleep, and neither does creativity. When you’re bootstrapping, you don’t have money to throw at problems, so you have to think your way through them. It’s like chess, and you’re always five moves ahead.

# Practical Bootstrapping Tips

1. **Start Small, Think Big** When resources are tight, you can’t boil the ocean. Focus on your MVP—your minimum viable product. What’s the *one* thing you can offer right now that solves a problem or brings value? Launch small, get feedback, and build from there.
2. **Barter Like Your Life Depends On It** No money? No problem. Find ways to trade services or skills. When I needed a logo, I didn’t hire a fancy designer. I found a local graphic artist who needed help with their taxes. Boom. Trade made, no money spent.
3. **Leverage Free Resources** The internet is a bootstrapped entrepreneur’s best friend. From YouTube tutorials to free tools like Canva or HubSpot’s CRM, you’ve got a whole arsenal at your fingertips. But remember: tools don’t build businesses—action does.
4. **Reinvest Everything** Your first profits aren’t for you; they’re for your business. It’s tempting to treat yourself when the cash starts rolling in, but hold off. Reinvesting is how you scale without loans or investors.
5. **Sweat Equity is King** Bootstrapping means you’re going to do a lot yourself. Marketing, customer service, inventory management—you’ll wear all the hats. It’s exhausting, but it also gives you intimate knowledge of your business that no one else will ever have.

# Bootstrapping with Faith

Bootstrapping isn’t just about hustle; it’s also about faith—faith in yourself, your vision, and, for me, faith in God. I’ve had nights where I stared at the ceiling wondering if I was crazy. What if this didn’t work? What if I failed?

Those moments taught me to lean into prayer. My faith became my foundation. I stopped asking God for a guarantee and started asking for guidance. And you know what? The clarity always came, even if the answer wasn’t what I expected.

There’s a verse that carried me through those times: *“Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans”* (Proverbs 16:3). Bootstrapping taught me to surrender the outcome while giving 110% to the process.

# The Hidden Blessings of Bootstrapping

Here’s the thing they don’t tell you: when you bootstrap, you learn things money can’t teach. You learn to sell—not just your product, but yourself. You learn to communicate, to connect, to empathize with customers. You learn resilience.

You also build trust with the people around you. When my wife saw me waking up early, staying up late, and pouring every ounce of effort into my dream, she became my biggest cheerleader. Bootstrapping isn’t just about growing a business; it’s about growing relationships—with your family, your customers, and your community.

# A Challenge for You

If you’re bootstrapping right now—or thinking about it—I challenge you to shift your mindset. Don’t see your lack of resources as a limitation. See it as a chance to get creative, to hustle smarter, and to trust in the process.

Take one step today. Maybe it’s setting up that Instagram account, reaching out to your first customer, or bartering for a service you need. Whatever it is, do it boldly and faithfully. You don’t need to have everything figured out—you just need to keep moving forward.

Remember, bootstrapping isn’t just about business; it’s about becoming the kind of person who can handle success when it comes. And trust me, if you stay the course, it will come.

Let me know: What’s your biggest challenge in bootstrapping right now? Let’s figure it out together.

Now upfront I am not perfect and I have to accept I have not handled this situation to the best of my ability, A lot of events happened so I may not be articulating this at my most concise. I just want to know what peoples thoughts are...  
  
1. I'm (29m) an idiot who flirted with a friend(40f) while she was grieving her mom over a year ago. I never initated anything in person however the way I spoke sexually (as I used to have that kind of humour) was suggestive at times and I offered for us to get togther for a smoke to see how it goes on one occasion, I remember thinking back then as long as I dont cross any lines or intiate anything it is fine. As I would prefer to be there for her as a friend dealing with her grief so I only ever felt comfortable hugging her but I accept my had my impulsive thoughts. Her loosing her mom was a huge life quake for her as she didn't have a great relationship with her dad.

2. We had been flirting previous to her loosing her mother and although there was certainly a change in her she never seemed or expressed a major dislike of me till the start of this year. We met up for a drink after work and she told me she did not like me in 'that way' anymore since her mother passed, it was a bit of a blow as didn't have any major indicators till then but I understood and accepted it as it wasn't too surprising upon quick refection as not my first rodeo, I did feel my behaviour may have been the reason so I did look to blame myself. I shut down and didn't communicate with her for a while as found out my dad's cancer was back and I got turned down a job I was going for so I felt overwhelmed so I ignored her when she reached out after that night.

3. After my silence I messaged and apologised she was pissed with me but she just quickly moved onto a new subject as nothing happened , she stopped coming over to see me in work and stopped making the effort in messaging me after this. She then asked for distance after a week or so of me talking to her again (I was being a typical man and trying too hard to make up for it) after my near month long silence, as she felt I wanted more from her than what she can offer. I respected this for about 2 weeks as at this point I was resided to being friends with her even though I did hold an attraction to her, I felt I could just wait it out in myself as she will eventually find someone else was my thought, I knew we were probably not relationship compatible due to some key lifestyle changes. I was still attempting to put some effort into the friendship however as we worked on the same floor, so after two weeks I messaged her and said i dont want to be more than friends (This seemed like the most logical thing to me, as didn't want awkardness in work) she accepted and moved the subject on like nothing happened. 

4. My dad passed away in April, it wasn't an unexepected death but it was harrowing in hindsight as I was there when he went. My friend being through something similar, I felt they were the only one I could relate to in this situation and understand me. I went silent again for about 2 weeks after he passed when I saw her on my return to work where she hugged me, later that day she suggested me coming over to hers for a smoke which in hindsight I should have been more careful of but I accepted her suggestion. Truthfully from here exact timing gets a little blurry for me. I go over hers once and we smoke, She asks me to try some perfumes of hers as she wants to know what my favourite one is which I do. She had been drinking too which for those not familiar with the green and beer life it is a risky one, I dont drink but predictably the combo hits her too hard as first time in a while. During this she starts admitting to being jelous of the other girls in work we used to work with as I would go over and talk to them as they were on our team at the time. She snapped at me once too about me not asking her out last year when we were flirting but I passed it off and we had a otherwise okay time till she hit her limit and was sick I made sure she was safe in bed. I slept on the sofa as I couldn't drive, the next morning she was pretty hungover to be fair but I was a emotional mess due to loosing my dad but she was pretty out of it understandably

5. I go silent again after this and my dad's funeral happens. About a week or so after I respond to her and she mentions needing a friend which is a rare thing for her to say and she asks me to bring smokes so I do and we get high again at hers, she starts talking about this guy in work she has a crush on and that she is worried that he is changing his behavour torwards her after some flirting in the office. We talk about partners etc and I say I dont want to sleep with anyone at the moment as I need to work on myself, the conversation moves on and she comes back to the guy in work and then expresses she is worried that she has forgotton on how to kiss someone, at this point we had smoked more and I was keeping with the convo she was on. She then asks me to kiss her for practice which me being an emotional rollacoster but wanting to make her happy agreed to it and so we did. After that I went back to where i had been sat till then, she moved to on then asking me to have sex with her. I dont even know what sort of autopilot I was on at that moment but I stupidly agreed, she only wanted to do things in a certain position and nothing else but that and kissing. I didn't want to accept the uncomfortability that was in me at the time but damn i was so alone. It got to a point where she was in pain and asked me to stop. I just wanted to leave at that point but tried masking the situation with humour, she asked me to leave her a smoke for herself to have, so I sit there making one and she barely looks at me now.

6. I leave and feel like I'm in complete shell shock as looking back I knew what had happened but I was too traumatised and confused, what followed was me shutting myself off again but I couldn't with her as I didn't want to accept what had just happened so I tried to be 'normal' but I couldn't show her what destruction had been wrought in me. So I hid at home and stopped going into the office and leaving if I saw her when I did come in rarely. One of these days she comes round to me for us to get a coffee on break where she initiated about the night we slept together, I cut in and in a jokingly way say dont worry I know you used me, I wasn't taking myself seriously and she said it was because she trusted me that she did that, I brush the subject under the bed and move on. A couple days after she mentions her period was late, Important context here I did wear a condom and I did not orgasm, so I felt the chances were slim but she made no mention of a pregancy test but I was too nervous to ask her to take one for about 2 weeks where I relented after she mentioned about her period still being later (a month late at this point)

  
7. She tries calling me one night after I go silent for a day or two after she confirms not pregnant, she has never done that before as she is very introverted as I am. I miss this call and message her the next day where she mentions she is worried again about this guy in work treating her differently. She provides more context on the guy and he is like 3 levels above her in the chain of command and has kids, so I try to be objective saying he probably isn't worried about you, she took this as an attack lashing out on me asking me if I was jealous, at this point I had no clue what to feel torwards her, I had already been trying to avoid her at times.  I try to patch things up by going over offering a smoke which I do after some intial kick back from her, I'm able to alieviate concerns and move on after some back and forth where she says she would leave the company if she made someone uncomfortable in work in relation to her work crush.

8. During this time I have started taking therapy as I cant even say the mental impact this was having on me at the time within a month of loosing my dad. I reached out to a friend or two in work as I was in desperate need of perspective and they were horrified but there was not much they could do. So I start trying to wrestle this in therapy and come to the conclusion I need to confront her after another night of me going over for a smoke with her, nothing happened luckily aside from her saying her therapist said that she used me, she laughs it off jokingly saying what even is using someone

9. I decide to confront this the next time I go over, throughtout this I think it was hard to fully hide from her it was affecting me but damn I was trying, It was tricky as we would only ever smoke on our meet ups. I asked her about what she felt about what her therapist where she asked me to clarify, and she said that she told her therapist thats what i said and they had a femine joke about it. This hit me a little hard and she pressed me on why I asked and I said my therapist recommended it.....at this point most of what had been affecting me came out and that I was not comfortable with what happened that night, she visibly started becoming very upset asking me if she was the reason I was going to therapy, did I tell anyone in work etc. I try to be honest as I dont want to lie but this just upests her further saying she trusted me. It is hard to recall every detail of this conversation but she then moved the subject back to the crush she had in work not being satisfied it seems with how I have answered her till this point. She essentially kicks off at me thanking me for 'making me feel this way'

10. The next morning she goes off at me in totallity saying we need distance and that I cant believe I felt that way, that I treat her like a girlfriend and asked me if I told my friends about me flirting with her while she was grieving her mom and that she is still grieving, I accept this blame apologising to her, she then cut me off. I try to later attempt some dialog once after a month with no response then later with her responding, the event really affected her and thinks we cannot be friends right now. Looking back I was unsure on why I was even trying to build dialog with her but I still tried, I stopped by again last month to drop a gift off as an apology where she says she was not upset with me but cant be friends. At this point I know what I was looking for was understanding and to be heard but I didn't know how properly so I respond by slamming the door and walking away, blocking her on everything I have 

11. A therapy session reawakened me in a tough way when I talked about this and my therapist asked me if the experience felt like abuse? and I broke down in tears right away because I knew then what i had spent months surpressing to a degree. When I told a manager about my experiences recently as its been affecting my work for a while they asked me if I had gone to the police? I was shocked and told a friend who actually told me they agree with me...

I may be missing some details here and there but in a way writing this out is a therapy for me so I apologise for any poor grammer and thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. ",1,1733245388.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False
1h5s80m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h5s80m/f28_had_a_threesome_with_my_boyfriend_m31_and/,| (F28) had a threesome with my boyfriend (M31) and another woman-and it was incredible,"So, I never thought l'd be writing something like this, but here we are. I've been with my boyfriend, let’s call him Jake, for two years, and we've always had a super open and honest relationship. 

A few months ago, we were lying in bed, talking about fantasies (as you do), and he brought up the idea of a threesome.

At first, I laughed it off, thinking, Yeah, right, that's something people joke about, not actually do. But he was serious-not pushy, just genuinely curious if it was something l'd ever considered. I hadn't really, and to be honest, the idea made me feel a little unsure.

I mean, the thought of another woman in our bed was intimidating. But the more we talked about it over the following weeks, the more I realized it wasn't about replacing me or anything like that—it was about sharing an experience together.

Fast forward to last weekend. We were at a music festival with a group of friends, just having the best time. That's when we met her. Let's call her Mia. She was part of a nearby group, and we just clicked. She was funny, down-to-earth, and had this magnetic energy. We started hanging out, dancing, and sharing drinks, and I started noticing the way Jake and Mia were vibing. Not in a threatening way-it was actually kind of exciting to watch.

As the night went on, we kept joking about how we all felt like old friends, and at some point, Mia mentioned she wasn't seeing anyone and was just enjoying life. I don't know what came over me, but I found myself saying something like, ""You should come hang out with us after this!""

Long story short, she did. Back at our place, we were all still buzzing from the festival energy, laughing and talking on the couch.

The conversation turned a little flirty (thanks, tequila), and eventually, I asked Mia if she'd ever had a threesome. She smirked and said she hadn't but wasn't opposed to the idea. I shot Jake a look, and it was like we were telepathically checking in with each other.

To my surprise, I wasn't nervous anymore-just curious and excited. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, the three of us were kissing. I'll spare the explicit details, but let's just say it was way more natural than I expected. What surprised me most was how much I enjoyed watching Jake with Mia. I thought it might make me jealous, but it didn't. Seeing him with someone else, knowing it was something we both agreed on and were experiencing together, was actually... hot.

And Mia was amazing-fun, respectful, and totally in tune with the vibe we were going for. She never crossed any boundaries and made sure I was comfortable the whole time.

The next morning, we all had coffee together, chatted a bit, and she went on her way. Jake and I spent the rest of the weekend processing everything, and l've never felt closer to him. It wasn't just about the physical part-it was about trusting each other completely and stepping outside our comfort zones together.

I'm not saying threesomes are for everyone, but for us, it was a beautiful experience, and I'm glad we tried it. If you've ever been curious about it, my advice is to communicate like crazy and only go there if you're both 100% on the same page.",13,1733245385.0,offmychest,3,0.81,False

GF has been unemployed for nearly a year, over the 5 years we have been together she’s had 3/5 jobs none of which she’s had for longer than 3 months. She’s worked an office job a 15 minute walk from her place(left because she didn’t like it), waitress/server which she left because of a small cut(I didn’t think it was bad at all but she insisted it was and I wasn’t going to tell her how she feels), supermarket checkout, and a stripper(told her I wasn’t comfortable with it and she left). She has been applying from what she tells me but I doubt it’s been more than 10 jobs in total, the reasons are because she has to drop off and pick up her mom weekdays from her work and she wants something with flexible hours that accolades her medical appointments and other life things etc. which I get but there are jobs ie Starbucks, Dunkin or anything really she can get which I mentioned once and she dismissed, I try to understand her situation but I just know she can get a job and I don’t want her doing something she doesn’t like but at the same time it doesn’t feel like she will. Her mom gives her shit for it too which adds to her depression. I struggle with understanding if I’m being unreasonable for feeling upset when she spends $100-$300 on clothes, going to concerts like beyonce which cost $1000 and she went both days and various others, getting her nails, makeup, wax and messages frequently. I understand I don’t support her but we don’t live together and I wish she made more progress for herself. We’ve already talked about this various times but I don’t see much change and I don’t even want to talk about it with her because she’ll get depressed and then it’ll be awkward and I don’t want to hurt her. I’ve been with her because we were each others first love and she is very kind and sweet with my family, she is a good person besides this but i don’t know if that’s enough anymore, I struggled thinking if there will be other good people out there and whether I am a quitter if I give up on the relationship again(we’ve been on and off). Like I would feel bad asking her to do a coffee shop job but at the same time I’ve done sales 6 days a week 12 hours some days, coffee shop, door to door sales all while learning to code and getting a job at an agency. All this while making time to go see her when she was in college, I would fly out to her because she was too busy with school and couldn’t work then either because she had to focus on school which she ended up not finishing 2/3 classes so she graduated without a degree. I don’t want to talk with her about this and kind of want to make a choice because we’ve already had convos about it and I don’t want to come off like I’m dumping past and current stuff on her because I don’t want to hurt her. I am flying to NJ in a few days and will be staying with her and her mom and I want to get a final resolution on this. Thank you in advance for any of the responses I’m really hoping to get something out of this. Pls don’t shit on her or me and just give honest feedback because I really don’t know what to do anymore. 


&nbsp;


Ps. Just wanted to mention that I do feel she genuinely cares about me based on how we always talk and how we are and the things we’ve been through together but I don’t know if that’s enough anymore. Also, thanks to previous person who commented and gave some really good advise, it was appreciated a lot and has given me a bit more clarity.

It would be a lie to say I grew up wanting to be a priest. My father would take my sisters and me to church every Sunday, whether it was snowing or blisteringly hot, we always went. While my sisters were off finding their husbands, I was growing in the faith and spent more time praying than socializing. However, I was still hesitant when my father told me I should attend a seminary school after graduation. It was not exactly the most thrilling prospect as a seventeen-year-old kid, but after some thought that summer, I decided to give it a shot. It would be the best and worst decision of my life.

Once I was fully ordained, I chose to spread my wings and spread the gospel to those places that had been neglected. After some searching, I settled on a town on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland called Blythe. It was a small, isolated fishing town whose main claim to fame was the rumored existence of a nearby Viking landing site. I knew it was my calling when I learned that it had previously been host to a catholic church. However, after it burned down in the early 1800s with the priest inside, there was never any attempt to rebuild it.

On my first visit to Blythe, I found the remains of the old church buried deep in the woods outside of town. There was barely anything left besides the cellar and some large logs still blackened by flames. It would be easy to clear the rubble and build my new church atop where the old one once stood. 

The locals were leery of me at first with not many outsiders coming through their neck of the woods. On this first visit, I tried my best to introduce myself to as many people as possible, but sadly, my trip ended before I could make any real progress. I did, however, get a group of workers to begin construction of the new church before I left. 

On my second trip, the locals were more receptive to my presence. Several people approached me, asking about the church, faith, and me personally. Frankly, I wasn’t expecting this kind of reception after my last visit, but there was one encounter that stood out. 

I was visiting the construction site. The sun was getting low and the workers were packing up for the day. Most of the framing had been done and I took great pleasure walking through the hollow interior imagining what it would look like finished. That was when one of the workers approached me.

“Excuse me, Father?” He asked, taking off his hard hat.

“Yes?”

I would come to find out his name was Johnathan Heathstead. He stood there and scratched his head like he wasn’t sure what to say next.

“Do you…Do you believe in demons?” He asked.

“Yes, I do.”

“But do you *believe* in them?”

“I…I don’t know what you’re asking,” I said.

Johnathan paused for a long second before speaking.

“Never mind.”

At the time, I didn’t think too much about this interaction but looking back, I should have. 

With my third visit, I brought two suitcases and my cat Spots. I was finally moving to Blythe. The church was finished, at least as finished as a church in the backcountry could be. I was proud of it. In fact, I was so excited that I opened the doors to all visitors that first day. Before even unpacking, I was greeting nearly two dozen people who had come to investigate this strange outsider. While that might not seem like many, every pew was filled in that small church.

There was one man, however, who wasn’t sitting. He was standing in the back watching me as I gave my little sermon and invited the crowd to attend that Sunday’s mass. After everyone filed out, he approached me.

It was Johnathan. I could hardly recognize him. He looked tired, with dark bags under his eyes and a long, disheveled beard. His clothes looked two sizes too big and it took me a moment to recognize they were the same clothes he was wearing the day I had met him. 

“Father,” He croaked, his voice harsh and dry, “Do you have a moment?”

“What has happened to you?”

“I need help,” he said with tears welling in his eyes.

While I was ready to listen to him talk about losing a loved one or going through a nasty divorce, I wasn’t ready for what he ended up saying. We sat in one of the pews for a few minutes before he started talking.

“Father…Do you believe in the Devil?” He asked.

“Yes, he is a wicked creature.”

“Do you believe he walks among us?”

“In the hearts of men, yes. The Devil seeks to tear us down and lead us down the path of damnation.”

Johnathan paused, more tears spilling down his cheeks. I became acutely aware of the smell of fresh lumber at that moment. Strange what you notice in the silence between words.

“I believe the Devil has his grip on me.”

“What makes you think that, my child?”

Johnathan took a long, steadying breath before he spoke again.

“I don’t know why, but I’ve started to…do things.”

“What things?” I pressed.

“I…I black out sometimes. Sometimes only for a few minutes, but other times for whole days. When I wake up…When I wake I…Sometimes I come to and I’m waist-deep in the ocean on the brink of the abyss. Others…others I am barechested and covered in b-blood. Normally I am outside, on a rock, or up a tree. But, sometimes I am in the basement of my house scribbling like a madman with chalk and blood.”

“Whose blood is it?”

“I-I-I don’t know. Sometimes I swear it is fish blood, others I am not too sure. Our dog went missing a few weeks ago…I don’t know.”

Johnathan broke down. Sobbing into his hands. I noticed they were slightly stained red. 

“Father, I need help. Please!”

Now, the Church has had controversy with mental illnesses being conflated with possession, so to say I wasn’t exactly reaching for my cross and bible over what this man was telling me would be an understatement. 

“Let me consult with my acquaintances,” I said, patting him on the back, “they will surely know what the best course of action is.”

“Father, I need help now!”

“Yes I know, but I am limited in what I can do right now.”

Johnathan’s face immediately sobered up and a flash of rage shined in his eyes. Tears still rolled down them as he stood up and stormed out of the church. 

“Go in peace!” I called out after him, “God protects all of his children and gives us strength!”

Johnathan paused halfway through the door and turned back to me.

“Then I am no child of God,” He said before slamming the door shut.

I sat there in the empty church for a while, considering what had just happened. My welcome to the town had gone smoothly so far but I was afraid, after what had just happened, that I might not be up to the task. Spots jumped up on my lap and started purring. It put me at ease and the rest of the evening went smoothly.

I had no way of knowing that that night, Johnathan would enter his basement and never emerge again. 

It was a closed-casket funeral. A small, intimate affair even though I am sure half the town showed up. It was there that I met Marie, Johnathan’s widow. A few days after the funeral, I decided to stop by the new widow’s home. I didn’t feel it was appropriate to crowd around her at the funeral or to simply ignore her. I’ll admit my motives for visiting were slightly selfish, a morbid curiosity of what had happened and the weight of guilt that I might have played a part in all this.

When Marie answered the door, it was obvious she’d been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy and her nose was almost rubbed raw.

“Good evening Father, what can I do for you?” She asked.

“I just wanted to stop by and offer my condolences,” I said.

She opened her mouth and closed it several times.

“Would you like to come in?” She said, biting back tears, “I need guidance.”

Marie led me inside to a small, two-person dining table in the kitchen. 

“Coffee?” She asked.

“That would be great.”

Her hands were shaking as she grabbed two mugs from the cupboard. 

“Father,” she started, “do you believe in demons?”

Now, I like to believe I am a rational man, but I would be lying if I said that question didn’t immediately make me feel sick to my stomach.

“Yes, of course.”

“Can they make a sane man do what Johnny did?” She asked, placing the mug of old coffee in front of me before sinking into the opposite chair.

“What did Johnathan do?”

“I-I don’t know. He told me he was having nightmares but I didn’t think they were all that serious. I mean who would? What was I supposed to do?”

“My child,” I placed my hand on her wrist, “what did Johnathan do?”

Marie wiped at her nose and looked at the basement door.

“He came home late and he was sweating like crazy. I got him water and he seemed to settle down. We went to bed and…and…” she broke down but quickly composed herself, “I found him down there that morning. The sheriff took his body and some photos but it was clear it was self-inflicted. He told me I got to clean it up but I haven’t opened that door since that morning.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Why, Father, why did this happen?”

“I don’t know, the Lord works in mysterious ways and the devil is always tempting us towards wickedness.”

Marie stood up and walked over to the window.

“You haven’t touched the basement?” I asked.

“No. No, not yet.”

“Let me help, it’s the least I can do.”

Marie led me to the basement door, but she didn’t open it, only nodding towards the doorknob before disappearing. The basement beyond was pitch black. I rolled up my sleeves and whispered a quick prayer. 

The stairs creaked as I descended into the darkness. I didn’t know what to expect but it wasn’t what was down there. 

I pulled on the light cord. It was an unfinished basement with low beam ceilings and concrete floors, a desk was pushed to the side with a rug rolled up and stored on top. It made a clearing in the middle of the basement. 

Red. Red everywhere. Streaks and drops. Smears across the floors and on the walls. The tinge of rusting iron hung in the air. Among the streaks, there were broken fingernails and scraps of skin, it made me feel weak.

At first, there was no pattern to the madness. Just intersecting lines and circles, hard angles, and jagged scribbling. My head was spinning and I stumbled back to the stairs. I sat for a while, staring at the self-inflicted carnage when it finally started to form.

It was a single, massive rune, or at least something like a rune. It was surprisingly intricate, with large smears making up the border with smaller drops and streaks for finer details. I felt sick.

I took several pictures of the rune from every possible angle. I don’t know what I would do but I felt I needed to document it. It took a few hours to clean up the blood. Even after cleaning the floor was still stained red. 

“God be with you,” I said standing on the house's front step, “it always gets better with time.”

Marie didn’t say anything as she slowly closed the door. 

Several months passed and I had settled into a routine. The buzz around the new church had died down and there was regular attendance during mass. While it wasn’t the most exciting place to be, Blythe and the surrounding countryside had started to grow on me. With the coming of fall and the changing of leaves, I found myself outside more and more. 

The forests behind the church could have well been endless. The locals had carved hiking paths through the trees and several fallen logs made excellent benches. I hadn’t seen or heard anything about Marie since I visited her house that night. Rumor was that she had secluded herself and was living as a hermit, barely leaving her house. Who could blame her?

Since that night, I haven’t looked at the photos I took. There was no need to, they were seared into my memory. I thought about that night regularly on my walks through the woods. There was one tree that was my turning point for my walks. It was a massive oak that was likely a remnant of the old-growth forests. I say this as a man of God, but I understand why ancient peoples believed these great things to be gods themselves.

It was after one of these hikes that I found a note folded up and slid under the door. It was written in handwriting so heavy it pierced the page a few times. It simply read: 

*Help.*

While it was a bit of a stretch, I presumed the note was from Marie. After all, who else would it have been from? She just needed help after Johnathan passed away. Oh how wrong I was. It was getting late but I made the trek out to her house that night. The house sat on the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean. 

Once I reached the front door, the sun had already set and the insects had started singing their tunes. I was about to knock when I realized the door was already open.

“Mrs Heathstead?” I called out.

Nothing but the darkness of the house answered. The door let out a low creak as I pushed it open.

“Mrs Heathstead? Are you here?”No response.

I stepped inside, the floorboards creaking under my feet. 

“Mrs Heathstead are you there?” 

I was about to turn back when I heard a faint sobbing coming from the basement. The basement door was slightly ajar, inky darkness on the other side. I took a step closer. The sobbing suddenly stopped. 

“There’s a man at the top of the stairs.”

The voice was almost indiscernibly quiet. 

“What did you say? Mrs Heathstead?”

My heart pumped in my ears as the voice spoke again.

“And another at the bottom.”

Screaming echoed from the basement. The inky darkness was dispelled as orange flames burst from the basement. I fell back, barely avoiding a burst of flames that licked at where I was standing. Scrambling to my feet, I barely got out of the doorway before the door slammed shut. By what force I don’t know.

The Heathstead house burned down in less than 5 minutes. It took nearly double that for the first men carrying hoses to respond. I stared at the flames, my clothes and hair singed. The flames swirled and licked at the night sky. 

The Sheriff determined it to be self-inflicted; how he came to that conclusion, I do not know. It made sense, easier to believe that a grief-stricken woman would choose to burn like that than to consider the alternatives. They can choose to live in ignorance, but I know that this was the devil’s work and it was far from over.

[Breville Touch Impress],"Just got a new Touch Impress. Really having issues getting a decent drink out of it. Here are my issues:
-It’s constantly telling me to change the grind. Up and down. I’m at 21 now and it finally has made a few cups without telling me to change
-Can’t get 1:2 ratio. Dosing 19-20g every time, no prob with that. But then pulling 55-60g of espresso for a double shot every time. And keeps telling me it’s too fast and to decrease grind size. I do, make coffee, and it struggles to get any coffee out and tells me to increase size.
-Milk-no matter what froth setting I’m using with whole milk all it seems to be doing is heating it up and putting some foam on the top. Milk itself doesn’t seem to be anything close to “wet paint” and more like just heated up milk that’s pretty thin. 

I am a beginner with this so I’m sure this is all me not understanding what to do or how to properly set stuff up. Help me Breville community!

I have one room available in this 2 bedroom apartment for rent on the first floor. The total is $3600 for the month, so your share would be $1800. Utilities run an additional ~$100 per month after this (pay for gas and electric, not water). The landlord just redid the kitchen/living room floors and your bedroom! This would be for December move in/asap through September with option to renew! Would be first month and security.

It's a nice space with lots of room and natural lighting. The landlord just redid the kitchen/living room floors and your bedroom!

Bedroom is spacious with walk in closet in picture. There is a storage closet, a work room, large living room and kitchen. Washer, dryer, and dishwasher on premises. Street parking with resident sticker.

Location is difficult to beat; 200 feet from Sennot park, 1 block from lamplighter, 5 minute walk to central square (and red line) and 5 minutes to Inman square. Easy bike ride of 5 minutes or 15 minute walk to MIT or Harvard. Loads of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops, along with a Whole Foods (3-4 min walk) in short distance.

A little about me: I'm a 34 yo gay male who works as a nurse (I work day shift, 3x12hr shifts but sometimes more). I'm pretty chill, easy-going, and easy to live with. I'm social outside the home but sometimes can keep to myself when home or I hide in my room sometimes haha, but I don’t mind roomie hangouts. I respect everyone's personal space! I enjoy traveling, hiking, breweries, biking a bit, running (kinda), going out to eat, photography, and just hanging with friends. I like to invite people over once in a while but of course would check in with you first.

I have no real pre-specified preferences for a roommate other than being a kind and respectful person, while also taking care of common spaces and being clean! Naturally, would love to meet to see if we would be a good fit.

Place is mostly furnished except for your room. There is a couch left by the previous tenant but it's a little run down, but l'm too lazy to find something new haha. There is no TV as well since I do not watch much of it.

Also place is not pet friendly.

1h5s3pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/1h5s3pr/i_betrayed_my_partners_trust_and_now_i_am_looking/,I betrayed my partner's trust and now I am looking for a path to reconciliation and to rebuild,"The past few months have been turbulent; life has been difficult, work has been stressful, and I have been struggling with my own issues. In the past month, I messed up a serious relationship—something that should have lasted forever, something I thought was set in stone with someone I loved more than anything and planned my entire life around.

During these weeks apart, I have been attending therapy regularly, unpacking a lot of things I was aware of but had been repressing. It has become clear that I come from a background of complex trauma.

I am an only child from a divorced couple and have lived with my mother since I was three. For a large part of my upbringing, I also lived with the rest of my family—grandmother, grandfather, aunt, and mother—all under one roof in a big apartment. If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have said I had a good childhood. But now, I see it was not as good as I thought. While I always had everything I could wish for materially, I was emotionally neglected, emotionally abused, and my needs were often pushed aside. I learned to put on a mask and serve my family to the best of my ability, even though it was never enough. *I* was never enough. Every accomplishment I made was met with disapproval, critique, or dismissal.

They always treated me like I was lesser because I was the youngest. That was always the argument: *“You’re younger; you should do this. You should listen to us because we’re older and we know better.”*

That dynamic left me constantly feeling inadequate, like a failure, and like a burden to others. The relationships I have had in my life have either been insignificant or ended with my trust being broken.

Fast forward to a year and a half ago: I met an incredible person. I fell in love so quickly, and we were perfect for one another. We clicked instantly and planned a life together. We adopted pets, moved in together, and built a life.

Earlier in life, I had become so emotionally drained and dead inside from trying to be perfect, so in need of feeling something, that I turned to pornography and developed an addiction. That addiction eventually escalated into chatting inappropriately with anonymous people online, far beyond anything appropriate. Once it reached that point, it was not about addiction anymore. It became a whole new unhealthy escape from reality.

The first time I opened an anonymous chat, I felt shame and disgust and closed it immediately. But a month ago, during a particularly rough period, I started spiraling. My self-esteem was at an all-time low; I did not feel like I was enough. I was working 20-hour days, my libido was nonexistent, and I constantly felt like I was going to lose my partner.

And then, for two weeks straight, I did nothing but actively work toward losing them. I was on Reddit, talking to people in ways that did not bring me joy, satisfaction, or even a sense of escape. It did not give me anything except temporary distraction from the emptiness I was feeling. But as soon as I put my phone down, my entire focus shifted to making my partner happy. I loved making them pancakes, coffee, and breakfast to send to their workplace. Sleeping beside them was the best thing I had ever felt; they cured my insomnia and sleep paralysis. And I threw it all away because I could not open up to them. I chased a high in ways I never should have.

When they saw the chats, they kicked me out of the house, and that was it. In the days that followed, we saw each other a few times out of necessity while I collected my things.

I decided to turn my life around. I know changes do not happen overnight, but I know they are my person. I know I deeply hurt them and their trust, and I am committed to working day and night to rebuild it as long as they will allow it.

They have been furious, angry, and said they hated me. Things have calmed down since, and they are showing signs that they still care about me. We see each other occasionally, and they have even offered financial help since I have moved into an apartment that is beyond my pay grade. Like I said, there are some obvious signs they deeply care about me still, up to the point they even admitted that there's a small part of them that wants this to work, but are not sure how to get past the broken trust.

I am committed to following through and being a better person—not just for them but for myself, too. That does not take away from the fact that I am doing this to be the person they deserve.

They keep asking me if I truly believe I can be what they need. That gives me hope, but it also terrifies me. I am scared that the no contact and the space I am giving them to heal and process everything will lead to them shutting down, losing their emotions for me, or deciding they no longer want the life we planned. I am terrified that I have killed the part of them that wanted a future with me.

I am doing everything I can to show them that I am here, that I am following through on my promises. I have taken on responsibilities to lighten their load, and I will be there for anything they need, big or small.

Every day, if I am not at work, I am in therapy. If I am not in therapy, I am reading, watching videos, journaling, or finding ways to connect with myself through healthy habits. I am learning to love myself so that I can truly love them.

I am not looking for excuses because there are not any. I cheated and consciously made that decision for two weeks straight. While I would never have taken it further or sought emotional or physical connection with someone else, trust is trust—and I broke it.

My trauma is not an excuse or justification. It is just something that shaped the unhealthy relationship I have had with myself, something I am working on day and night. I know I have made rapid changes, and I can only hope they will be here to see it.

We talked all night but didn’t exchange landline phone numbers - this was before we had cell phones. A week later, my cousin set up a hang out at a coffee shop, which she invited him to so I could see him again, but he never showed up. I was visibly hurt, and her best friend who came with us went on and on about how I had dodged a bullet. That everyone knew he was a player who got close to girls and dumped them after he got wanted he wanted. My cousin was surprised by this because she had never heard anything bad about him. But she believed her best friend and I idolized my cousin who was older than me, so if she believed her, so did I. I felt humiliated and angry that I almost became one of his “conquests"".

A week later, I went to see my cousin at her school. He was there and when he saw me, his face lit up and he came over, extending a hand and said “hi (my name), it’s so good to see you again!” He had a huge smile on his face. I looked at him straight in the face and said “umm... do I know you?” His face fell. I walked past him and didn’t look back. I am ashamed to admit that I felt proud of myself for what I’d done for preserving my dignity and pride.

Months later, my cousin had a falling out with her best friend, who had been lying to her about all sorts of things and spreading vicious rumours about her. I realized the awful things she’d said about this guy were probably lies too. But, I never saw him again to apologize as my cousin switched schools shortly after this happened.

I learned some hard lessons from this experience:

1. Never idolize anyone, because they are people and all people are prone to making mistakes.  
2. Never take what a trusted friend says at face value.  
3. Never go for public humiliation, no matter how well-deserved you may think it is. It just makes you look like an ass.

So, two years ago now, I started working at a local fast food place that just so happens to serve iced coffee and whatnot. It was like my first month at the place, so I was completely and utterly unaware of the horror I'd be experiencing with customer service.

Allow me to set the scene: I (15F at the time) was being trained on making the coffee drinks and taking orders in the drive thru. I consider myself a very fast learner, so after about an hour of training, I was pretty confident. 

Now, around 10:30 A.M., we had this absolutely wonderful customer come through the drive thru and order FOUR large iced coffees: to put that into perspective, our larges are about 30 oz. I made the coffees with the correct amount of flavoring and creamer, stirred carefully, and the customer was on their way. 

Or so I thought. 

About five minutes later, the same customer comes RUSHING into the place with their drinks in their hands, looking completely flabbergasted beyond belief. I went up to the counter to help out this entitled customer (EC), and the following conversation ensued:

Me: hi, how can I help you?
EC: you made this coffee wrong! It tastes like dirt.
Me: im sorry about that, what seems to be the problem?
EC: DO you SEE how dark it is!? Look!

Now, at this point I had the thought in the back of my mind that this customer was entirely out of their mind. The coffee was the color you'd expect any vanilla latte to be, not even dark in the slightest. I gave her a confused look and took the drinks back with the promise that I'd fix them. 

I added some more creamer to each and flavoring (about 2 extra pumps per drink) and gave them back to her with a smile and apology, and she was on her way once again. 

Then, I KID YOU NOT. Not even ten minutes later, she comes back with the same damn coffees and she is throwing a toddler tantrum at this point. 

Me: Hi, how can I help y—
EC: YOU MADE THE COFFEE WRONG AGAIN! IT TASTES LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT! 

At this point, I was so annoyed and fed up, but I did my best to smile and apologize and I took those godforsaken iced coffees back to my station and stared at them for a while before I had an idea. 

For context, the creamer machine has buttons with numbers for the amount of shots of cream you'd like in your drink. It goes all the way up to 12. I grabbed myself a large coffee cup (about 30 oz), and pressed the 12 button until the cup was 3/4 of the way full with complete CREAMER. I then emptied over half of each of the cups and poured the pure creamer into each cup until it was full.

At this point, i think each coffee had been about 3/4 filled with just coffee creamer, and nothing else. 

I smiled to myself, grabbing the drinks once again and bringing them to the entitled customer, where she smiled at the almost WHITE complexion of the drinks and said, ""THERE. This is perfect!"" 

I watched that woman walk away and out the door with the straightest face that I could muster before I burst out into evil laughter.

This is not meant to be generational bashing, as I am a Millennial and I am still exhausted by the notion that we don't want to work, despite me being almost 15 years into my career. This is meant to illustrate a trend I have observed that I believe is caused by the instant gratification of our devices and people stretching the definitions of words that have specific clinical meanings to encompass whatever they need it to. Anyway, I digress.

Over the holidays I had a discussion with one of my cousins (23F). She is an aspiring fashion designer with a degree from FIT and an impressive portfolio. Since graduation she has worked a number of jobs from barista to waitress to an aide for a somewhat well-known designer, but has never lasted more than a couple of months in any of those jobs. I empathized with her situation, as I had a hard time finding work when I graduated back in 2012. However, something about the way she was describing her experiences was raising a red flag in my mind:

* The coffee shop: ""Too toxic."" 
* The restaurant: ""Owner used racial microaggressions.""
* The designer: ""Traumatizing.""

I considered what she was saying, then I asked her to describe why she was using terms like this to describe the work environments. What were her bosses or co-workers doing that was so traumatizing? She began to recount her day-to-day experiences and I realized that everything she was describing was just part of the expected grind for each of those roles (no pun intended on the coffee shops). 

She was mad that instead of getting to just serve customers at this tiny coffee shop, she also had to scrub toilets in her downtime. The ""racial microaggressions"" her boss at the restaurant used were asking multiple times for her to adhere to a dress code that did not include certain brands of clothing, because it's an upscale place that has a uniform policy, and their clientele (which includes people of color) expect their servers to dress a certain way. It is part of the ambience of the restaurant. She even signed a contract on that one. Finally, the designer had asked her to do things in her off-time, and when she responded that she didn't think it was appropriate, the designer quickly found a new aide that was willing to hustle. It is part of the culture of the fashion industry.

**Discomfort.** That is the feeling my cousin is describing. She was asked to do things that she did not agree with, but instead of taking time to think about her path forward, she dismissed the work with an attitude of ""this is not serving me"". What she did not consider is that there are tens of thousands of people lined up behind her, happy to scrub toilets and run late-night errands for an eccentric designer on the off chance that it may lead to greater opportunities down the road. That's just the way that industry works, and you won't change it from the bottom.

The world is not here to serve us. It is not fair, and it is not just. But as my favorite nine-fingered dark fantasy character would say, ""You've got to be realistic about these things.""",7,1733243079.0,selfimprovement,3,0.89,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

It's like when you come home after a extremely long day and you just felt peace when you cross your front door}. During my eight hour shift with ""M"" he speaks quite a bit to me and I speak back savoring every word.... & His laughing with his oh so handsome head tilt. ""M"" considers himself to not be shy but just VERY VERY VERY few words.... Infact many customers mentioned that he was ""rude"" or ""shouldn't be in this job if he doesn't wanna talk"". From someone with 7+ years dealing with Customer Service I can see what they meant even if they were idiots in the way they said it. I've heard it said to others throughout my career and different jobs but when they said it to ""M"" it made me extremely mad and it pretty much always lead to me flirting with him and him responding in kind when they left. I've never really had courage when it comes to guys i meet in person but something was telling me ""INVITE HIM TO COFFEE!!!"" So, I finally worked up the nerve and asked.... ""M"" said said he would enjoy that. I felt like I was that little boy walking down the underwear aisle discovering what it meant to feel things and I'll admit, although probably moreso due to me checking him out throughout the shift I had a rock solid hardon for the rest of my 4 hours (it was tucked away tho not obvious either due to looser pants). ""M"" doesn't drive so I offered him a ride home. At first he declined and said his mother would be picking him up which is more than fine. At the very very end of my shift he runs out to me as I was about to leave and said ""Um.... About that ride..."" He got in my car and the flirting went through the roof.... I played his favorite song and he seemed so happy. He ""accidentally"" missed his house causing us to have to turn around which looking back I think was an excuse to have a longer drive.
... I so wish that I just kept driving because I didn't want that night to end. I pull into his driveway and he started get flustered and moving super quick like he was nervous/embarrassed.... I somehow worked the courage to ask him for his phone number. I can remember how much he blushed he turned red like physically red.... He saved his phone number as ""M 💞"" I felt my heart racing the rest of my way home and I swear my heart beat faster than I was driving. I texted him and he responded ASAP! We both worked from 10pm-6am and we're exhausted but managed to stay awake till like 2pm flirting and talking and confirming our date on Monday. I just met him so I don't want to say I was in love but like I'd never felt that way for someone in person before. Most of my relationships have been online or somewhat distanced.

The second day, I was training with a different person and somehow within like 30 minutes of my conversation with them they brought up that ""M"" had a sex tape with this homless guy that stays and sleeps on the floor of where I work overnight and his sister & that he and the homeless guy were still fucking and dating (apparently they knew eachother from age 19-24).  I know it's just a rumor (so far) but I felt such anger and frustration almost betrayal even tho ""M"" may or may not have actually done anything? I guess it just really threw me for a loop that the second day of knowing him and I'm already hearing about his conquest with other people and it really really hurt for some reason. During this whole time ""M"" has not responded since 2pm that previous day. I never brought it up over text or anything because I wanted to ask him in person. It seemed to be something that would be better addressed in person. 

Third day went by with training still hadn't heard back from ""M"" I really don't know how to feel at that point. My head was feeling with the idea of him and that guy being together it almost enraged me....

On Thanksgiving ""M"" messaged ""Hey! Sorry about the absence been busy helping family prep for Thanksgiving"" and I felt a calm wash over me.

Another couple of days came and gone and no more messages. I know he's alive because he's been going to work and all but nothing between us.  Monday was slowly approaching but it felt like the quickest couple of days I've ever experienced was both agonizing waiting and waiting hoping to see him or at least get a text from him but also at the same time fastly arriving at the idea that he isn't going to message me or even if he did that he would end up standing me up. That day I messaged him ""Are we still on for Coffee? It'll be nice to see you again and get to know you better!"" And he didn't respond.... I had to go to work and nothing at midnight I messaged him ""Guess that's a no then. "" And nothing still. I was working last night/this morning the homeless guy showed up at my work and said he was there because ""M"" told him to meet him there (never showed?) the homeless guy asked me if I had ""M"" phone number or his socials.... I absolutely did but I did not want to give it away to him and bedsides it's against company policy to give away other employees information and if ""M"" wanted him to have it he would have given it to him. The homeless guy even stated that ""M"" moved from the house that he knew where he lived at but ""M"" didn't give him his new address (I had it tho after all I dropped him off).

I can't get this boy out of my head. He just makes me feel giddy and light inside but then this whole ordeal has been a nightmare imo. I really like him so far and we match on a lot of things. What do I do? Am I delulu bros? Did he even want there to be a date or was it just a way to get that ride home? If so, why the 💞 on his contact info (he put it himself) why flirt why text why laugh at jokes etc etc? I had this dream last night that he and I got married and had kids that looked like half and half of us they were so cute and we were happy. Is this just my subconscious trying to give me a happy gay ending or is this possibly like not an insight to the future or anything but like a subconscious vision of what could come?

Please help me, as I said this is my first in person guy. I really like him even enough to overlook these ""Red Flags"" (?).

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I’ve been running my trusty 8-year-old Breville Barista Express (BBE) at work, brewing 2-3 shots daily—mainly espressos and long blacks/Americanos. It’s been an absolute workhorse, but lately, I’ve started noticing some issues:

	•	The grinder is inconsistent.

	•	Extraction quality has gone downhill.

	•	Since my BBE lacks the adjustable burr, I can’t try the recommended burr rotation fix.

After years of faithful service, I think it’s time to retire it and explore an upgrade or replacement that will deliver consistent, high-quality espresso every day. I’m open to experimenting with something new as long as I can grind and brew effortlessly.

Budget: Under $1000

I’m based in India, so I’d love suggestions for region-specific options or brands that are accessible here (all-in-one or separate grinder + machine combos).

Our first date went fine. I met her on her birthday after work, and we went on a coffee date. We celebrated her birthday, went outside, and took a long walk. We had long conversations—not about work—but about shared interests, and we spent time opening up to each other. I may have shared more about myself than she did.

During the walk, we held hands, and I gave her compliments, mentioning that she looks even better in person. I also showed some small gestures.

Things seemed smooth, but before planning our second date, she mentioned: 'I haven't felt a spark yet. Maybe I'm just out of emotions or something, but I'm giving it another chance to see if something clicks this time.'
(maybe because of her past relationship which last for 5 years but it's been almost 9-10 months and she told me that she gad no feelings for him)

We're planning to meet this weekend, and I genuinely want to make it work out.
