I don't smoke or drink. For the past 8 months to a year most of my joints have been consistently hurting badly for no reason to the point of it stopping me from going out often and I have had really awful troubles with sleeping. It's not insomnia though, I can sleep all day and I'll still wake up delirious and fall back asleep, waking up later and then I'll just feel tired and lethargic the whole day and night no matter how much i get to sleep or if i drink a lot of coffee to try and wake myself up.

I have been experiencing pain in mostly my knees but sometimes shoulders and wrists too. It stops me from walking for more than 10 minutes without my legs (especially ankles) beginning to hurt so badly I can hardly feel my feet, and it has made me withdraw and stop going out as much as I used to.

I can't really carry anything slightly 'heavy' at all either (e.g shopping bag kind of weight) without my arms hurting but I think thats just because I'm quite weak now anyway,idk. My joints arent really stiff for a long time in the morning if that helps, i think so? I'm getting kind of desperate because they have started to hurt even worse than before and now i find it difficult to write for a while (fingers/wrists) and the thing with my knees. It's not rheumatoid arthritis (took a blood test for something came back normal iirc.) so I'm getting kind of lost because that's like the only thing i was really talked to about at the minute.

also i am in the UK if that adds any info. I don't have any health conditions that this could be causing I think but I do have asthma (i use inhalers) and I have been anaemic in the past. I was only going to talk about the joint pain since it bothers me but the sleeping has become a really big issue so i put it in here too. thanks for reading if you did lol. reposted

I'm seriously considering bringing a kettle and freeze-dried coffee, but what do I do for milk then? Will it stay cool in the beverage cooler provided?

1pf85co,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfastwomen/comments/1pf85co/getting_started_keeping_going_hi_folks/,"Getting Started, Keeping Going, hi folks!","I started my intermittent fasting journey last year, stopped for a while because I realized I needed to rethink and tweak things and have started again in the last month or so.

I’ll be 41 later this year.

Part of what I’m doing is cutting out things that simply put too much pressure on me such as actively tracking calories (which I’d been doing for over a decade, I have a good idea of what is in various foods), using an IF tracking app, etc.

I just find taking the time to do so takes more time than it should. This seems to be working better for me.

That said, I started this round at 193.4 pounds. After a month, I got down to 184.4. I’ve been fasting four days per week.

After Thanksgiving I was back up to 189.6 so I’ve decided to start fasting every day during the week and giving myself breaks to eat normal on Saturday and Sunday, with occasional extended fasts.

Today I’m down to 188.0! I’m taking every little win. I’ve noticed my cheeks are a little slimmer than they were a month ago!

I try to eat primarily vegetables, I am cutting out unnecessary cooking oils and fats, except for what is naturally found in the occasional small amounts of meat I eat.

I’m also cutting down on sugar. Fasting days I’m usually drinking black tea or coffee, but I need to start adding more herbal teas.

I did make the decision to fast extra hours yesterday (16/18 is my typical, but I managed to go a full 22hrs!) and broke my fast with a pizza. 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ An entire pizza. Lots of veggies. No sauce. Cheese.

So, fasting again today! 

Broke it with oatmeal, thinking about a veggie-topped baked potato next. With fermented sauerkraut.

Other factors: I struggle with a chronic pelvic floor injury which makes typical workouts difficult or dangerous (I shouldn’t run or lift anything more than 5lbs, technically), autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, chronic tendonitis and hypermobility. 

All of which is why I’ve gained so much over the past ten years.

Goal: back to 134lbs, greater strength, flexibility and endurance.

Longer term goals: running.

Anywho, TLDR: thanks for listening, thoughts, tips, adjustments I might be able to make etc or mutual encouragement are welcome.

Endoscopy and Colonoscopy three years ago showed nothing (other than mild reflux detected). I had another attack that lasted 5 days in Sept 2025. They put it down to reflux, gave me omeprazole and sent me on my way. I took it for maybe two weeks straight, then weaned off. The doc called it a “paediatric dose”, 20mg twice a day. Did it help? Idk. But I guess the attack ended. 

NOW every day, the minute I put something in my mouth, I get a god awful acid taste in the back of my throat. All day. Zero pain or reflux symptoms associated, just taste. Doesn’t matter if it’s oats, eggs on toast, almond milk, coffee or avocado to start my day, the taste is there. 

I’m scared to go too hard and eat a lot of “junk” (obviously) but I have been dabbling in coffee and coke some days trying to see if they’re a new trigger (never had a problem before). I clearly have an issue, but a hard reset for a few weeks changed nothing. This constant acid taste is a new symptom in my life and there’s no rhyme or reason to what’s triggering it.

In this 2025‑updated rundown, we’ll trail through those top‑searched bits: from her 5’1″ frame to her 24‑year‑old optimism; from a net worth that keeps sheft around the globe to the rich tapestry of Mexican‑Irish roots fueling her voice; we’ll peek at the relationship vibes that keep her fans swooning, and a healthy weight snapshot that underscores her commitment to wellness. Every paragraph will flow seamlessly, because just like Isabella’s on‑screen charisma, we want you to glide through the facts without missing a beat.

# Isabela Merced Height

When a film poster pours her silhouette over a silver screen, you’re tempted to measure: “What is Isabella Merced height?” The answer, spoken in a hushed reverence by casting calls, is  5′ 1″ (1.55 m). This mid‑range stature isn’t just a number—it’s a foundation for how she dominates both the stage and the storyline. As I watched her speak last year at a signing event and caught the subtle brass of an 8‑foot television set, her leaning posture reminded me that height, in Hollywood, isn’t merely about inches; it’s about presence.

# Isabela Merced Age

Early shots of Isabella in *Barbie Girl* seemed to think she might be a teenager in the making. But the real question—how old is Isabella Merced? The precise date marks her birth on July 10, 2001, making her 24 in 2025. That’s a full year after her first million‑view TikTok post and a launchpad toward becoming a voice for under‑represented stories. It feels almost poetic that a youthful age—if someone can call it that—matches the real rebel spirit she carries on set, from intense rehearsals to coffee‑shop conversations about representation.

# Isabela Merced Net Worth 2025

Picture a ledger that glistens like the award‑winning outfits she drapes on the red carpet. In 2025, estimates peg [Isabella’s net worth](https://llovebillie.com/isabela-merced-height-age-net-worth-ethnicity-relationship-weight-2025/) at a bold **$3 million**. This is no mere vanity figure. Each credit, from signing deals with kinetic brands to a private partnership with a streaming giant for a high‑profile docuseries on Latinx artists, contributes to that number. Fun fact—while you’re scrolling through “Isabella Merced net worth” on your phone, imagine those dollars scaling a vacation budget for a space‑restricted trip, or investing in a sustainable clothing line that she’s experimentally launching this year.",1,1764971939.0,llovebillie1,0,1.0,False

It was a summary of points that I had learned at the time and a good introduction to alcohol and drinking culture.  Someone else asked for advice about alcohol today, so I decided to revisit and rework my post.  This time I have the benefit of a few years of experience behind me, and can give much more solid advice.  With that, here is my updated ""Alcohol 101 for Post-Mormons.""

>**Huge Disclaimer**

>Don’t start drinking just because some stranger on exmormon reddit made a guide. Alcohol is an addictive substance with significant health risks. I’m not encouraging anyone to drink if you don’t already. Alcohol is *not* risk-free: it can harm your health, relationships, and judgment. For some people, trying alcohol will be the worst choice they ever make.

>Tread carefully. Know when to slow down, take breaks, or stop entirely.

>That said, not everyone who drinks develops a problem—and almost everyone leaving Mormonism is at least curious. If you understand the risks and still want to explore alcohol responsibly for social or cultural reasons, here are my recommendations as a fellow post-Mormon entering this world for the first time.

# Understand the Basics / Ask Questions

Three years ago, in my late 30s, I had my first drink. If you’re like me, everything about alcohol—its vocabulary, culture, and etiquette—can feel new and overwhelming. Thankfully, you can learn the essentials quickly.

When you are reading a menu, look up unfamiliar ingredients or drink names on your phone. If your server or bartender says something you don’t understand, *ask.* A simple, “I’m new to this—can you tell me more about these options?” is enough. In my experience, staff are happy to explain things, and it’s far better to ask questions than order something you end up hating.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What Is “a Drink?”**

There’s a running post-Mormon joke about going to the bar and nervously ordering “one alcohol, please.” It’s funny until you’re actually standing at the bar with no idea what to say (more on that in a minute).

Understanding what counts as *one drink* is essential to responsible drinking.

Each type of drink will have a different concentration of alcohol. Your standard beer will have about 5% alcohol by volume (ABV), while many wines are close to 12% ABV, and Spirits are generally 40% ABV. This can be highly variable though, especially with craft beers or cocktails, so always look at the bottle or menu so that you know how much alcohol you are consuming with each drink. The higher the ABV, the faster a particular drink will get you drunk. If you want to calculate how much alcohol is in a non-standard drink, then you can use [this website's drink calculator](https://www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/tools/calculators/drink-size-calculator.aspx).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Food and Time — Your Greatest Friends**

A key part of responsible drinking is learning how alcohol affects *you*: how quickly you feel it, what your tolerance is, and how long your body takes to metabolize it. Two factors help you stay in control:

**1. Food**

Eating before you drink slows alcohol absorption and helps prevent getting drunk faster than expected. A solid meal, especially carbs like bread, makes the experience smoother and more predictable.  
**Avoid drinking on an empty stomach.**

**2. Time**

Your body processes **about one standard drink per hour (see above)**. If you pace yourself at around that rate, your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) rises slightly and then drifts back toward baseline. Most people stay in the “relaxed/buzzed” zone rather than getting drunk.

When you’re new, the **one-drink-per-hour rule** is a safe, simple guideline.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Your First Drink Should Be at Home**

I recommend having your first drink in the privacy of your own home. It’s familiar, low-pressure, and you don’t have to worry about driving, crowds, or doing something embarrassing. You can pay attention to how the alcohol feels, how quickly it hits, and how long it lasts.

There’s nothing wrong with going out with a trusted friend, but for a true first-time experience, home gives you comfort and control. My own first drink was a simple rum and Coke I mixed myself and sipped over an hour, relaxed, easy, and enjoyable.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to Order Alcohol**

Okay, here’s the part you’ve been waiting for: how to actually order a drink when you go out. The good news is that it’s much simpler, and much less intimidating than it feels the first time.

You’ll typically order alcohol in **two types of places**:

**1. Limited Bar (Most Mid-Level Restaurants)**

You won’t see the bartender or bottles; drinks are made out of sight. They serve *only* what’s on the menu, no custom cocktails.

When you sit down at your table, drink orders are usually the first thing your server asks for, so skim the menu, and choose something that sounds appealing, or ask:

* “Which drinks are good for beginners?”
* “Which ones are on the sweeter side?”

And then pick one. That’s it. Nobody is watching you, and your server is probably glad because alcohol orders mean bigger tips.

**2. Full Bar (Bars, Pubs, High-End Restaurants)**

You’ll see the bartender and all the bottles. Ordering from a table with a server is the same process as above.  If you are ordering directly from the bar, simply stand or sit at the bar and wait; staff will approach you when it’s your turn. They’ll ask, *“What can I get for you?”* and you just say:

“Can I get a \[name of drink\]?” (for example, “Can I get a margarita on the rocks?”)

They’ll make it, return with your drink, take your credit card, and ask a very important question:

**“Open or closed?”**

* **Open tab** → You plan to order more drinks. They keep your card behind the bar, and future orders require only that you tell them your last name.  They keep a running tab.
* **Closed tab** → You want just one drink. They charge your card immediately and return it.

If you keep an open tab, when you’re finished for the evening, get the bartender’s attention and say: **“Can I close out?”** They’ll print your final receipt and return your card.

It can seem intimidating at first, but after your first time, it becomes as routine as ordering food.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Choosing What to Drink**

Let’s be honest, alcohol tastes weird (read: gross AF) at first. Most soda-raised ex-Mormons don’t immediately love beer, wine, or straight spirits. That’s normal. Start with mixed drinks and sweeter wines, then branch out as your palate develops.

Here are a few beginner-friendly drinks to try:

**Very Sweet**

* Hard apple cider (Angry Orchard, Redd’s, Strongbow)
* Piña Colada
* Blue Hawaiian
* Malibu Bay Breeze
* Moscato wine (very sweet, almost grape-juice-like)

**Sweet**

* Margarita
* Moscow Mule
* Cosmopolitan
* Sangria
* Rum and Coke (or Coke Zero, Diet Dr Pepper, etc.)
   * *If you want a boozy version of your favorite soda, Malibu Rum is a good place to start.*

**Not Sweet, But Still Beginner-Friendly**

* Light lager beer (Coors Light, Michelob Ultra, Miller Lite)
* Whiskey Sour
* Vodka Cranberry
* Espresso Martini
* Gin and Tonic

**Drinks That are Famous/Popular, but** **Not Good for Beginners**

* Old Fashioned
* Martini
* Negroni
* Mai Tai
* IPAs (a very bitter type of beer)
* Dark beers
* Dry red wines
* Straight spirits (bourbon, rum, vodka, etc.)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Drinking Rules to Live By (According to Me)**

Everyone’s relationship with alcohol is different. Some struggle; some don’t. These guardrails have helped me stay moderate:

**1. Don’t drink alone.**

And by this, I don’t necessarily mean “only when you are alone.”  I mean don’t be the only one drinking, even if other people are around.  It’s easy to turn “just one drink while doing chores” into an unintended day of drinking.  It’s easy to make “a couple of beers after work” a habit. Habitual solo drinking increases the risk of overconsumption, liver strain, and alcohol use disorder (AUD).

**2. Don’t drink two days in a row.**

This gives your body time to recover and helps you notice if you’re developing cravings or dependence.

**3. Don’t exceed 14 drinks per week.**

What is moderate drinking?  CDC guidelines define:

* **Moderate drinking:** up to 2 drinks/day for men; 1 for women.
* **Binge drinking:** 5+ drinks in \~2 hours for men; 4+ for women.
* More than 14 drinks per week for men (7 for women) counts as *heavy alcohol use*.  That might sound like a lot right now, but it’s surprising how quickly a couple of nights going out to dinner, a house party, and brunch with friends can exceed 14 drinks in a week.  Negative health effects greatly increase with heavy drinking.

**4. Drink water.**

Aim for one glass of water for every two alcoholic drinks.

**5. Eat before drinking.**

Your future self will thank you.

   
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Preventing a Hangover**

Hangovers come from three main sources: **dehydration**, **congeners**, and **overconsumption**.

**1. Dehydration**

Alcohol is a diuretic—it causes you to pee out water faster than it is replaced. Without enough water, you’ll wake up with a headache. Drink water throughout the night and a full glass right before bed.  If you know that you are going to a party where you will have several drinks, it is helpful to drink an electrolyte replacement as well, like Pedialyte or Liquid IV Hydration packets.

**2. Congeners**

These trace chemicals in alcohol worsen hangovers.  They are commonly found in dark alcohols and cheap alcohols.  
**High in congeners:** red wine, whiskey, brandy, cognac, dark rum, mixto tequila, dark beer  
**Low in congeners:** vodka, gin, blanco tequila, sake, light beer, white wine  
(There’s some anecdotal evidence that sparkling wines can hit harder too.)

If you’re prone to hangovers, stick to lighter/clear alcohols.

**3. Overconsuming**

No amount of water or “cleaner” alcohol will prevent a hangover if you simply drink too much. Know your limits and your next-day obligations.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Alcohol and Medications (Important Safety Note)**

Before you start drinking, double-check how alcohol interacts with any medications you’re taking. Some combinations are harmless, others are dangerous, and a few can be life-threatening. Always look up “\[your medication\] + alcohol” or ask a pharmacist if you're unsure.

Common medication categories to be especially cautious with:

* Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, etc.) — can increase sedation and make you feel drunk faster
* Anti-anxiety medications / benzodiazepines (Xanax, Ativan, Valium) — extremely dangerous to mix with alcohol
* Sleep medications (Ambien, Lunesta) — greatly increase impairment
* ADHD medications (Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin) — can mask how drunk you really are
* Pain medications, especially opioids — combining with alcohol can be fatal

If in doubt, wait, check, and stay safe. The interactions can sneak up on you.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**Get a Breathalyzer**

This may sound extreme, but buying a personal breathalyzer with police-grade sensors was incredibly helpful. When I first started drinking, I had no sense of how many drinks corresponded to various BAC levels.

Using it—often at home—I learned:

* How my BAC rises after each drink
* How quickly I metabolize alcohol
* How long it takes me to sober up
* What different BAC levels *feel like* (0.01%, 0.04%, etc.)

Over time, I could estimate my level without the device. You don’t *need* a breathalyzer, but it’s a great harm-reduction tool for staying aware and in control.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to Tell If You Have a Problem**

The goal is to enjoy alcohol without letting it damage your life. Here are checkpoints to occasionally ask yourself, based on the definition of **Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD):**

AUD is a medical condition involving difficulty controlling alcohol use despite negative consequences.

Key signs include:

* Being unable to limit how much you drink (“Once I start, I can’t stop.”)
* Wanting to cut down but being unable to
* Spending a lot of time drinking, obtaining alcohol, or recovering
* Feeling strong cravings or urges to drink

If these resonate, consider cutting back and seeking support.

**Red Flags to Watch For (Early Warning Signs)**

Even if you’re being careful, it helps to watch for early warning signs that your relationship with alcohol might be drifting into unhealthy territory. Problems rarely show up all at once, they creep in slowly. These red flags don’t automatically mean you have Alcohol Use Disorder, but they *are* signals to pause and reevaluate.

Here are some of the biggest early warning signs:

**1. You Drink to Change Your Mood**

If you regularly drink because you’re sad, anxious, lonely, angry, or overwhelmed, that’s a major red flag. Alcohol can temporarily blunt uncomfortable emotions, but when it becomes your “coping mechanism,” it builds dependency quickly.

Healthy drinking = to enhance a good time  
Unhealthy drinking = to escape a bad one

**2. You Hide or Downplay Your Drinking**

If you find yourself:  
• Not telling people how much you had  
• Finishing a drink before others get to the table  
• Pouring more than you admit  
• Feeling defensive when someone asks about your drinking  
These are signs you’re not comfortable with your own consumption—and that discomfort is the red flag.

**3. Your Tolerance Is Increasing**

Do you need more drinks to feel the same buzz?  
Are you surprised at how “little” a few drinks seem to affect you now?

Rising tolerance is often treated as a badge of honor in drinking culture, but it’s actually one of the earliest indicators of dependence. If you notice yourself needing progressively more to feel the effects, slow down immediately.

**4. Alcohol Is Becoming a Default Activity**

If your first thought is:  
• “We should grab drinks.”  
• “I need a drink after today.”  
• “What should I drink tonight?”  
or if alcohol becomes the anchor of most social plans, that’s worth thinking about.

**5. You Frequently Drink More Than You Intended**

Most people overshoot occasionally. The red flag is **frequency**:  
• You plan on one or two, but regularly end up at four or five  
• You “lose track” of how much you’ve had  
• You often feel surprised or embarrassed the next day

Consistently drinking more than planned is one of the most reliable predictors of future problems.

**6. You Drink Even When You Know You Shouldn’t**

Examples:  
• You drink when you need to wake up early  
• You drink when you’re sick or exhausted  
• You drink even though you promised yourself you wouldn’t  
• You drink despite medication or health issues

This shows the alcohol is starting to override your decision-making.

**7. You Feel a Strong Pull or Craving**

This can be subtle. Early cravings often feel like:  
• “Man, a drink sounds *really* good right now.”  
• Thinking about alcohol at random times  
• Feeling restless until you drink  
• Looking forward to drinking more intensely than you expected

Cravings don’t mean you’re addicted, but they’re an important “yellow light” moment.

**8. Alcohol Is Causing Problems—But You Keep Drinking**

Some examples:  
• You’re more irritable or emotional after drinking  
• You’re noticing fights or tension with your partner  
• You’re performing worse at work  
• You’re cancelling commitments because of drinking or hangovers

If alcohol is creating problems, and your response is… to keep drinking, even occasionally, that’s an early warning sign.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What To Do If You Notice Red Flags**

You don’t need to panic. Early awareness is your best tool.  
Here are simple corrective steps:

• Take a 2–4 week break from alcohol  
• Return to “first principles”: one drink per hour, no more than 2 in a night  
• Stop drinking alone  
• Avoid drinking when you’re sad, stressed, or bored  
• Tell a trusted friend you’re recalibrating  
• Write down how much you’re drinking for a couple of weeks

If red flags persist—or if you’re worried about losing control—reach out to a professional or support group. There’s no shame in catching a problem early. In fact, that is the *healthiest and strongest* thing you can do.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Your Alcohol Tolerance Will Change**

When you're new to drinking, your tolerance starts out low. Over time, if you drink regularly, it increases — but it can also drop quickly if you take a break.

A few things to keep in mind:

* Taking even a few weeks off can reset your tolerance
* Don’t assume you can handle the same amount you could months ago
* Feeling “fine” is not the same as being sober
* Increased tolerance is not a good thing — it usually means you’re drinking more than your body wants

Pay attention to your body. Recalibrate often.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# Final Thoughts

**Drinking and Driving**

You already know not to drink and drive. But here’s the part most beginners don’t realize:

*Your BAC can continue rising for 30–60 minutes after your last drink.*

That means:

* You might feel “fine,” but your BAC is still going up
* You can go from legal to illegal to drive *after* you stop drinking
* Coffee, cold air, showers, or food do *nothing* to sober you up

The only sober-up method is time. When in doubt, assume you're not safe to drive.

Use rideshare, ask a friend, or plan ahead.  Anything except getting behind the wheel.

 

**Mood Changes**

Remember that alcohol is a depressant: the same chemicals that mellow you out can also make you feel down. If you notice your mood worsening or sliding into darker territory, reach out for help.

 

**Social Situation Safety**

There unfortunately are bad people in the world who would take advantage of the situations that involve alcohol.

* Never leave your drink unattended.
* Don’t accept drinks from strangers unless you saw it made and the bartender delivered it to you.
* If a drink tastes unusually strong or “off,” stop drinking it.
* Have a plan for getting home that doesn’t rely on someone you don’t trust.
* Pace yourself even if others are drinking faster.

Several importers are now showing pricing that looks noticeably cheaper, and it does not appear that the previously announced 40–50 percent tariffs are being applied anymore. For example:

Both are showing landed prices that look like they are not factoring tariffs at all.

This raises a question for anyone in the roasting or importing side:  
Are other importers still pricing their Brazilian coffee with tariff costs included, or has everyone already adjusted their numbers after the recent policy changes?

The tariff situation in 2025 has been a roller coaster. First Brazil was hit with a heavy duty, then later green coffee was moved into the “tariff-free agricultural products” category. Now it feels like importer pricing is beginning to normalize.

Here’s exactly how I did it — and yeah, you can literally copy the framework if you want.

---

 🧠 Step 0: The idea

This didn’t come from some “trending product” tutorial.
It came from frustration — my own.

I kept seeing people in Discord servers, Reddit subs, and small creator groups complain about burnout:

_I can’t keep track of client work.
_I keep forgetting what to post.
_My to-do lists are chaos.

Nobody wanted another “planner template.”
They wanted a system that helped them actually breathe.

So I built that.

---

_ Step 1: Build something you’d actually use

I made a Notion system that fixed my own mess first — not some random idea I thought would sell.

Here’s what it included:

 A content calendar linked to client tasks
 A money tracker that calculates monthly income automatically
 A reset page for journaling and reflection
 A quick 5-minute video walkthrough so people don’t get lost

Nothing fancy. Just useful. It worked.

---

 Step 2: Price it like a “why not” purchase

I priced it at $9.
No fake discounts. No “limited-time-only” urgency. Just nine bucks.

People spend more than that on coffee every day.
The goal wasn’t to impress — it was to remove hesitation.

---

 📣 Step 3: Talk about the *pain*, not the product

I didn’t post “Hey, buy my Notion template.”
I talked about what it fixes:

Feeling behind on projects
Forgetting deadlines
Burnout from juggling too much

I even shared real screenshots of my messy Notion setup.
That honesty is what made people trust it.

---

 Step 4: Sell where the buyers are

I didn’t spam my followers.
I went where my target people hang out:

* Reddit subs for freelancers & Notion nerds
* Twitter threads about productivity & burnout
* A few Facebook groups for solo creators

I shared the story, not just the link.
People DM’d me asking, “Is this the Notion system you mentioned?”
That’s when sales started rolling in.

---

 ⏳ Step 5: Give people a reason to act now

No fake scarcity. No countdown timers.
I just said:

 “Once I hit 100 buyers, the price goes up. It’s not staying $9 forever.”

It was honest. And it worked.

---

 Mistakes (so you don’t repeat mine)

 I over-explained early on. People want results, not essays.
 I made it too complicated at first. Simplicity sells.
 I ignored Reddit for a week — biggest mistake. My top 20 sales came from here.

---

 Want to steal this?

Go ahead.

Either:
👉 Follow the same framework (real problem → simple product → smart pricing)
or
👉 Build your own version from scratch.

If you’re tired of “make $10K in 7 days” BS, this is the opposite of that.
It’s boring, realistic, repeatable — and it works.

---

TL;DR:
Stop chasing flashy ideas.
Build something small that solves one real problem well.
Price it so low that people don’t think — they just buy.
Then tell a genuine story.

That’s how you hit your first $600+ day.
Not luck. Not hype. Just systems. 🧱

# Loki crashes the Chaos

Alex was four days into living in a post-revelation reality where all gods were real, his roommate had brokered divine peace treaties, and he'd just eaten 4,000-year-old Babylonian lamb stew that tasted like heaven wrapped in cuneiform.

His notebook was bursting at the seams—pages on Ragnarok, pantheon territories, defunct gods running bakeries in Queens, and the existential crisis-inducing revelation that every religion is real.

It was Friday evening, and Alex was on the couch processing everything Perseus had told him over the past few days. John was in the kitchen experimenting with what he claimed was ""authentic Phoenician bread"" (which involved ingredients Alex couldn't pronounce and a fermentation process that predated Jesus). Perseus was scrolling through his phone, occasionally showing Alex more photos of Andromeda's art gallery and making comments like ""That's my shield from the Medusa fight—they labeled it 'possibly ceremonial.' Idiots.""

Alex was just starting to feel like he had a handle on cosmic reality—all pantheons real, gods powered by belief, territories established, John friends with everyone—when a knock at the door shattered his fragile sense of understanding.

Not a normal knock. A playful, mischievous tap-tap-tap that sounded like someone was knocking with a dagger while grinning about it.

Perseus looked up, his expression shifting to something between delight and oh no. ""That's Loki.""

""Loki?!"" Alex's voice cracked. ""As in, Norse trickster god, chaos incarnate, the guy who caused Ragnarok and got grounded for turning a cruise ship into a rubber duck?!""

""That's the one,"" Perseus said, grinning. ""Don't worry, he's mostly harmless. Emphasis on mostly.""

Before Alex could process that the literal god of mischief was about to walk into their apartment, John opened the door with the casual ease of someone greeting an old friend who'd once stolen Thor's hammer with him.

""Loke!"" John said, pulling the figure into a one-armed hug. ""What brings you to Brooklyn? Finally get tired of Odin's grounding?""

# Enter Loki: Chaos Personified

Loki strolled in like he owned every dimension simultaneously, and Alex's brain immediately cataloged him as ""trouble incarnate wearing a designer suit.""

He was tall and lean, with slicked-back black hair streaked with emerald green that caught the light like it was photoshopped. His features were sharp—high cheekbones, angular jaw, eyes that danced with emerald fire and promised both fun and ruin in equal measure. He wore a tailored green suit that screamed ""I dress better than your entire pantheon,"" with a tie pin shaped like a serpent that seemed to writhe when Alex looked at it too long.

His smile was a razor's edge—charming, dangerous, and deeply amused by something Alex couldn't quite identify but suspected was ""everything.""

""Odin's grounding ended last month,"" Loki said, his voice like silk wrapped around a blade. ""I'm a free god again. Thought I'd drop by and see how my favorite mortal-botherer was doing."" His emerald eyes locked onto Alex, and his smile widened. ""And you must be the famous Alex. The mortal pet who's survived John's nonsense longer than any other. Fascinating.""

Alex felt his throat go dry. This was Loki. The guy who'd caused Ragnarok, tricked gods, turned cruise ships into rubber ducks for fun. And he was calling Alex fascinating in a tone that suggested he was either deeply impressed or planning something terrible.

""Uh,"" Alex managed, his voice coming out like a squeaky toy. ""Hi? I'm... yeah. Alex. The roommate.""

Loki's laugh was velvet dipped in mischief. ""Oh, I love him already. John, where did you find this one? He's delightful.""

""Craigslist,"" John said, returning to the kitchen to check on his Phoenician bread. ""Same as always. But yeah, Alex is special. Hasn't bolted yet, even after meeting Perce, Merlin, Lucifer, and Morton.""

Loki's eyebrows shot up, his grin turning absolutely wicked. ""Lucifer and Morton? And he's still here? Oh, this mortal is either incredibly brave or deliciously unhinged. I must know which.""

# Loki's Chaos Worship

Loki didn't sit so much as drape himself across the couch like a Renaissance painting of mischief incarnate, one leg over the armrest, his serpent tie pin glinting in the light.

""So, Alex,"" he purred, his emerald eyes fixed on him like a cat that had found an especially interesting mouse, ""tell me: how does it feel to be the only mortal who hasn't fled screaming from John's chaos? Most would've cracked by now—Lucifer's whiskey nights, Death's tea parties, the realization that your roommate conquered Persia before your country existed. Yet here you are, munching cookies and taking notes like a diligent little scholar.""

Alex clutched his notebook like a shield. ""I, uh... made a spreadsheet?""

Loki's laugh echoed like thunder mixed with wind chimes. ""A spreadsheet! Oh, that's magnificent. You documented your way through an existential crisis. No wonder John likes you— you're methodical chaos, the best kind.""

Perseus, sprawled on the other end of the couch, grinned. ""Told you, Loke. Alex is solid. Outlasted everyone else by a mile.""

""Outlasted is an understatement,"" Loki said, his tone shifting to something almost reverent. ""Most mortals—those precious, fragile creatures—they see John's world and shatter like cheap glass.""

He leaned forward, his eyes glittering. ""But you? You built evidence, cross-referenced, made a color-coded spreadsheet, and when Perseus confirmed it all, you didn't break. You just asked for more information. That's not survival, darling—that's adaptation. That's evolution in realtime. You're not just enduring John's nonsense; you're thriving in it.""

Alex felt his face flush. ""I'm just... trying to make sense of things?""

""And that,"" Loki said, pointing at him dramatically, ""is why you're still here. You don't deny reality when it gets weird—you catalog it. You're a data analyst in a world run by trickster gods and ancient conquerors. It's wine for me, watching you piece it together. Pure, intoxicating chaos.""

*Notes: Loki's Assessment*

• Calls me ""mortal pet who survived""

• Impressed by spreadsheet methodology

• Says I'm ""adapting/evolving,"" not just surviving

• ""Thriving in chaos"" = why I'ms still here

• Loki finds my resilience ""intoxicating chaos"" (positive)

# The Small Talk of Trickster Gods

Loki, having thoroughly analyzed Alex like a specimen in a cosmic lab, turned his attention to Perseus with the ease of old friends catching up.

""So, nephew,"" Loki said, grinning, ""still married to the lovely Andromeda? How is she? Still running that gallery, sneaking in artifacts that should be in the Louvre?""

Perseus snorted. ""She's great, Uncle Loki. And yeah, she's got one of Dad's shields on display— second floor, labeled 'possibly ceremonial.' You should visit. She'd love to see you.""

""I just might,"" Loki said, swirling an imaginary drink. ""Though last time I visited, I turned one of her pretentious critics into a ferret for an hour. She was not amused.""

""You turned someone into a ferret?"" Alex blurted, his pen frozen over his notebook.

Loki's grin was unrepentant. ""He said her work was 'derivative.' I gave him a tail and whiskers. Seemed proportional.""

John called from the kitchen, ""Loke, we talked about this. No transforming mortals without consent.""

""He consented to being an art critic!"" Loki shot back. ""That's basically asking for punishment!""

Alex scribbled furiously: *Loki can turn people into ferrets. Avoid art criticism in his presence.*

Loki and Perseus continued their banter, trading stories with the casual ease of family who'd known each other for millennia. Loki mentioned pranking Hades by swapping Cerberus's dog food with squeaky toys (""The howling was magnificent""), and Perseus countered with a story about  helping Thor recalibrate Mjolnir after John returned it (""He's still salty about the theft, Uncle. Still."").

Alex listened, half-terrified and half-fascinated, as two mythological figures gossiped about gods like they were neighbors.

*Notes: Loki + Perseus Small Talk*

• Loki calls Perseus ""nephew"" (family connection)

• Loki turned art critic into ferret for insulting Andromeda's work

• Pranked Hades (Cerberus squeaky toys)

• Thor still mad about hammer theft

• Casual family dynamic (thousands of years of history)

# Alex's Loki-Induced Panic

""So, Alex,"" Loki said, his attention snapping back to him like a spotlight, ""what's the question burning in that delightful mortal brain of yours? You've learned about pantheons, territories, Ragnarok—what's next? The afterlife? Creation myths? The nature of free will? Give me something juicy.""

Alex's brain scrambled. He had a thousand questions, but with Loki staring at him like a professor who'd just called on him in class, only one came out:

""If all the gods are real and they've established territories, do they ever... hang out? Like, does Zeus invite Odin to poker night? Do you and Seth grab coffee?""

Loki's laugh was a velvet explosion. ""Oh, darling, you're asking the right questions. Yes, we hang out. There's a bar in a pocket dimension—neutral ground, no pantheon affiliation—called the Axis Mundi. Gods from every tradition meet there to drink, gamble, gossip, and occasionally settle disputes without wrecking the mortal world.""

""There's a god bar?"" Alex's voice hit dolphin pitch.

""Of course there is,"" Loki said, like this was obvious. ""Where else would Thor and Ares armwrestle while Anubis judges their form? Or Lucifer and I play darts while Athena critiques our aim?

It's neutral ground—no divine politics, just deities unwinding.""

""And my dad goes there,"" Perseus added. ""He's banned from the poker table, though. Counted cards too well, pissed off Hermes.""

""Your dad is banned from god poker?"" Alex asked John, who'd emerged from the kitchen with fresh bread.

John shrugged, unbothered. ""Hermes is a sore loser. I was just playing smart.""

""You were counting with millennia of experience,"" Perseus corrected. ""That's not smart, that's cheating.""

""Semantics,"" John said, offering Loki a piece of bread. ""Want some? Phoenician recipe, circa 1200 BCE.""

Loki took it, sniffed appreciatively, and grinned. ""You spoil me, old friend.""

*Notes: Axis Mundi (God Bar)*

• Neutral pocket dimension where gods from all pantheons hang out

• Drink, gamble, gossip, settle disputes without wrecking mortal world

• Example guests: Thor, Ares, Anubis, Lucifer, Athena, Hermes

• John banned from poker (counted cards, pissed off Hermes)

• ""No divine politics"" rule

# The Departure and the Blessing

Loki didn't stay long—""I have an appointment with a particularly smug hedge fund manager who needs a lesson in humility,"" he said cryptically—but before he left, he stopped in front of Alex, his emerald eyes glinting with genuine amusement.

""You're a rare vintage, mortal,"" Loki said, his tone sincere beneath the mischief. ""Most would've broken by now—run, screamed, convinced themselves it was a hallucination. But you? You documented. You adapted. You're still here, asking questions, eating John's ancient bread like it's normal. That's not just survival—that's art.""

He leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Don't break on us, Alex. The multiverse needs more mortals like you—clever, resilient, just unhinged enough to handle the truth. You're John's anchor to humanity, whether you know it or not. Keep him honest. Keep him human. And for the love of chaos, keep that spreadsheet updated.""

With a wink and a flourish, Loki vanished—not walked out, not teleported, just vanished like smoke dissolving—leaving behind the faint scent of ozone and mischief.

Alex stood there, frozen, clutching his notebook like it was the only solid thing in a liquid reality.

""Did... did Loki just give me a pep talk?"" he asked, his voice hollow.

""He likes you,"" Perseus said, grinning. ""That's huge. Loki doesn't like mortals—he finds them amusing, sure, but like? That's rare. You made an impression.""

""He told me not to break,"" Alex muttered, staring at the spot where Loki had been.

""And you won't,"" John said, sitting down with his own piece of bread. ""You're tougher than you think, Alex. Loki sees that. So do I.""

# The Aftermath

Alex collapsed onto the couch, his notebook open to a fresh page, and wrote:

*Notes: Loki Visit*

• Met Loki (Norse trickster god, chaos incarnate)

• Called me ""rare vintage,"" impressed by spreadsheet methodology

• Said I'm ""adapting/evolving,"" not just surviving

• Gods hang out at Axis Mundi (neutral god bar in pocket dimension)

• John banned from god poker (counted cards)

• Loki told me not to break, said I'm John's ""anchor to humanity""

• He LIKES me (rare for Loki + mortals)

• Can turn people into ferrets

Final Thought: A trickster god gave me a pep talk and told me to keep my spreadsheet updated. My life is a cosmic sitcom.

Perseus raised his beer. ""To Alex, blessed by Loki and still standing.""

John clinked his water glass. ""To Alex, the mortal who impressed a trickster god with Excel.""

Alex laughed—exhausted, overwhelmed, but somehow still here—and clinked his notebook against their drinks. ""To living in a world where Norse gods crash your apartment and tell you you're doing a good job at not going insane.""

They drank, they ate John's 3,200-year-old Phoenician bread (which was incredible), and Alex added one final note:

I'm John's anchor to humanity. I matter. And apparently, I'm good at chaos.

The rent was still cheap. The gods were still real. And Alex had just been complimented by the literal god of mischief for making a color-coded spreadsheet.

He wasn't moving out. Not a chance.",1,1764971606.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Even stuff that others dont like such as the guac I still enjoy. That being said, I had some coffee when I went this afternoon and, no joke, its probably the worst coffee I've ever tasted. I had no expectations, it being taco bell and all, but it was genuinely so bad. Im not even a stuck up coffee person, I just drink it straight black and usually wait for it to cool off then down it in 3 or 4 big sips. But the taste, it was burnt tasting and also had that weird bitter taste when coffee sits out for a few hours and you reheat it. It was honestly god awful, maybe I just got unlucky but idk ive just never tasted coffee that bad, even from other fast food joints.",1,1764971488.0,tacobell,9,0.67,False

1pf7s6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pf7s6u/obsession_with_three/,Obsession with Three,"In my mediocre life, everything had to be done three times.

Three sips of coffee and three bites of bread to start my day — if I failed, I had to punish myself three times. If I didn’t, something terrible might happen.

In my youth, this obsession with the number three pushed me to the very edge of sanity. My mind was severely compromised, and only now, in captivity, do I see with clarity all the monstrous things I’ve done. Do not misunderstand me — I do not seek your pity. I simply want you to see that what I did, I did. There is no nobility in murder, no justification. Killing is killing. Period.

I will spare you my melancholy and say nothing of my past. Let us go straight to the events leading up to the cruel murder — and then, finally, to the act itself.

One morning I took my usual three sips of coffee and three bites of bread. I combed my hair three times, brushed each tooth three times, tied three knots in my shoes, and checked three times to make sure the door was properly locked.

Then I left for work — always accompanied by the number three. That afternoon, on my way home, I stopped by a bakery, and there she was: **Amelia**. The moment I saw her, my world froze. She was the most graceful creature I had ever seen.

Amelia had black hair, soft curls, dressed in black, and her skin was the color of almond. Her eyes vibrated with life, and her spirit was strong and bright — a beautiful woman with a naturally beautiful soul.

Sharp as she was, Amelia noticed that I was staring — and of course, she didn’t like it. What woman enjoys being stared at by a melancholic stranger? I imagine the discomfort I caused her. Forgive me for that, my poor Amelia.

Days passed, and I kept returning to the same bakery just to see her. One evening, I gathered enough courage to approach her. I was surprised she didn’t reject me immediately. Little by little, Amelia and I became good friends. She was funny, and her laughter was the most wonderful sound. She had strong ideals and a truly spirited nature. I could listen to her for hours and never grow bored.

As time went on, we grew fond of each other, and as a proper man, I made sure to do everything correctly, just as my mother had taught me. I spoke to her father and quickly gained the family’s approval. Amelia and I were married on a beautiful April morning in 1900.

In our intimacy, I told her about my horrid obsession with the number three, and how my mother was certainly to blame — a story, dear reader, I may tell one day. Slowly, my sweet Amelia helped me overcome it, and naturally, I began to forget it. Years passed. We had one child, then another two — all with black hair like Amelia.

More years passed, and Amelia lost two beautiful babies. Despite everything, our marriage survived the storms of life and grief. After long, painful months, our fourth child was born — meant to be a new light after immeasurable loss.

But the fourth child was different. His hair was blond, like mine. At first, I tried to ignore how much that bothered me, how deeply I felt something was wrong with that child.

He reminded me of myself as a boy — which disturbed me even more. He consumed all of Amelia’s attention, and may God forgive what I am about to confess: I hated him. I hated that child — blond like a devouring fire, needy like a sickness. Amelia barely had time for me or the others.

My mother, may the devil keep her, had never shown such affection or understanding to me as Amelia gave to that devil.

Slowly, the number three crept back into my mind.

I began noticing patterns: with Amelia, the boy smiled three times; with me, he hiccupped three times before crying for three full minutes, followed by a three-minute pause and three more minutes of crying. I swear he did it on purpose. What child behaves with such precision? Tell me.

His wicked little eyes watched me with malice — I know how insane it sounds, but believe me: that thing was not a normal child.

My heart tightened every time I watched Amelia give him attention. While she received love from that little devil, I received only disdain and tears.

Ashamed to admit it, many times I considered suffocating him, telling Amelia I found him that way — a sudden illness, a tragedy. But I couldn’t. It would be wrong. And it would destroy Amelia.

As weeks went by, my obsession grew stronger, haunting me. I drank more and more to silence evil thoughts — and the hatred I felt for that little devil.

In my dreams, I often saw myself getting rid of the problem in the most sadistic way possible — the way my mother had taught me long ago…

I drifted between nightmares and insomnia, guilt, jealousy, and rage. The bottle was my constant companion in that storm.

Amelia noticed that I was no longer myself. I no longer laughed at her jokes, danced with her on the porch, or came to bed. I was merely a skeleton of the man I once was.

I made excuses — tiredness, work, stress — lies she knew well, yet she accepted them. Poor Amelia… how could I hurt her? How could I do what I did?

One day, the little devil fell ill. He cried three times, paused for three minutes, then cried again. I know it sounds absurd, but I timed it — every single time, the number three appeared. He was doing it on purpose. What child does something so synchronized?

His mysterious illness lasted weeks, and our family crumbled under the strain. Amelia grew pale and exhausted. Her dark circles were as blue as the night — she no longer slept because the thing woke every three hours, crying endlessly.

My poor children asked when he would finally recover, and why — unlike them — he was so frail. I had no answer.

One night, it seemed the little blond devil finally surrendered to sleep. Everyone rested — everyone except me.

That cursed night, the devil began whispering in my ear. I refused to listen and began to drink. Three sips at a time — three sips to empty a glass, three glasses to empty a bottle. I broke three cups I had been gifted on three special occasions. Rage overtook me. And finally, I obeyed the whispered orders that had long poisoned my drunken mind.

I slipped into the kitchen while everyone slept. I took the third knife from the third drawer. I walked up the stairs three steps at a time and went to the room of my three children.

Moonlight shimmered over their black hair — beautiful as ever. But there was no time to admire them. I had to obey.

Silently, I approached each one and cut their throats — three cuts each — so they could not scream. They suffocated in their own crimson blood.

I wiped my hands on one of their garments and left the murder weapon beside their bodies.

Then I went to the room of the blond creature, fully intending to kill it at last. When I entered, I looked at its peaceful face. The moonlight illuminated its hair. He looked like me — the same birthmark on the foot, same mole on the hand, same pale hair.

He was my clear replica.

I picked up a pillow from the rocking chair where Amelia used to cradle him. As I approached the crib, the thing opened its eyes, looked directly into mine — and smiled.

He smiled at me. His gaze burned like hellfire, and his smile was malicious, terrifying.

I wasted no time. In my madness, I pressed the pillow over his face and suffocated him to death.

I cannot say at what moment Amelia’s maternal instincts warned her, but they did. She rushed in and caught me in the act. She pushed me away, screaming in agony as she saw what I had done. I had betrayed her trust, stolen her natural right to see her children grow. It was only natural that she hated me.

Her eyes — filled with disdain — ignited my rage, and I struck her. Amelia fought with all her strength, useless as it was. In the end, I overpowered her, and in a frenzy of hatred and bloodlust, I gouged out her left eye — and ate it.

As Amelia screamed in agony, I came to my senses. Horrified, I fled, leaving her to her fate.

At dawn, the police found me in an alley three blocks away. They told me Amelia had survived long enough to report me. I surrendered without resistance.

The shadow of what I did still hangs over my mind, and now I hear only the three laughs of the devil who led me to commit such acts.

Now I sit here, writing this confession in shame. I attempted to write it three times, across three long days, and only today has it finally flowed from mind to page.

There is nothing more to say — nothing more to do.

**Amelia, forgive me for everything.**

*Ella Purnell Height, Age, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Relationship & Weight 2025*

Every time I scroll through my feed, I stumble on the same question: *“Who’s Ella Purnell?”* It’s almost a reflex, like swiping the “?” icon. I’ll start answering because it’s a good hook, but don’t get lost in the data dump – there’s a story in those numbers. 

* Her height tells you how she fits the camera and the catwalk.
* Her age shows where we are in her narrative arc.
* Her net worth glimpses the sweat behind the sparkle.
* Her ethnicity paints a picture of a modern, multicultural Britain.
* Her relationship status speaks volumes about boundaries and priorities.

These bits aren’t trivia; they’re the “behind‑the‑scenes” punchlines of a thriving career. We read them because we’re curious about the person, not just the person in the spotlight.

# Ella Purnell Height

Official: 5 ft 5 in (165 cm). Yes, that’s *not* skyscraper‑tall, but it’s *just right* for a British actress who’s danced off her feet in *Stardust* and *The Great Wall*. I remember watching the scene where she twirls — there’s a subtle elegance that comes with moderate height, a little spiritual “nothing dresses me better than confidence.”

Stranger than fact? In action movies, a height that can fit tight spaces matters. Think of the stunt choreography in *The Great Wall*, where Ella fits in without a wardrobe mishap. And her modest size? It gives her a *versatility* that’s rare — she can be both strong and gentle without sacrificing either.

At 29, Ella’s choices shift from teen melodrama to complex character studies.  
A question I asked her in a panel last year: “What interplay do you feel between being a woman, an artist, and someone with a birthday and calendar?” She paused, as if searching for the phrase that doesn’t exist in the manual. “We’re all aging artists,” she answered, and that line lingered.

**Here’s the original post**

You wanted Disclosure.... I am a whistleblower recently ""retired"" from the inside. And you're only getting part of the truth.

Hi. So I heard y'all want disclosure? Alright, hope you have time for this because there's a LOT. Grab a coffee or maybe get comfy with a pillow somewhere.

I've been watching the news and hearing a lot of things I know to be true shockingly being talked about openly by some higher ups in a documentary so I figured what the hell?

You can call me Rhea. Not my real name obviously, but it will do. 

A little about me... I spent about eight years in the military to pay for college and then another decade plus in a part of the US intelligence component that does not officially exist. On paper I worked for a boring sounding office in a department most people have never heard of. In reality it was a compartment inside a compartment where the odd stuff of a certain nature got routed.

My actual specialty is electro-optics. Lasers, sensors, EO imaging systems, the math and hardware behind how we detect things at a distance and, in some cases, put energy on them. That is what I trained in, what I did most of my serious work on once I was off the deployment treadmill. So when I say I know something about directed energy weapons and weird sensor returns, that's not ""I heard this from a friend of a friend"". That was my day job. Most of my career was boring in the way dangerous jobs are boring. Long days in windowless rooms. Iraq and Afghanistan in the early years, doing the usual mix of SIGINT and HUMINT support. Phone records, pattern-of-life workups, building target packets on people who’d never know my name but might notice a drone overhead later. After I got out of uniform I slid over to contractor work, then got pulled into the permanent government side.

For a long time my world was very normal: counterterrorism, sanctions evasion, shady cargo going through weird ports, stuff like that. After that, foreign missile tests and what you have probably seen described publicly as space domain awareness. Basically, watching dots move around the sky and trying to decide whose dots they were and what they were doing.

The weird part started when I was detailed to a small interagency working group looking at what was called ""anomalous aerospace and undersea systems"". Translation: things detected and showing up on sensors that did not match any known platform, did not behave like clutter, and did not go away when you changed radar modes or swapped optical systems. I was there because I understood both sides of the equation: the physics of the sensors and the intelligence context. You get taught very quickly to treat anything unexplained as a glitch, a calibration issue, operator error, software artifacts, anything that keeps your world tidy. You get used to hearing “weird glitch” as a catch-all. Except after a while you notice some of those “glitches” kept showing up, across different systems, different countries, decades apart. Same behaviors. Same basic locations. Same signature that never quite fits. At some point you either admit there is a real pattern or you drive yourself crazy trying not to see it. If you are useful and you start asking the wrong questions for long enough, someone eventually pulls you aside, takes you to a SCIF, takes your phone, has you sign your life away again, and shows you the next layer of the onion. 

This onion goes so deep I doubt that even after years of briefings I've been exposed to anything below a few layers. Even still most of this is purposely kept off NIPR and JWICS and is done in person.

That is where I learned about most of what you're interested in here and what seems to be bubbling to the surface in the news lately. That when I learned about what we call The Council. Yes aliens, and I suspect you're not likely to see a lot of what I know mentioned even by some who know it who have begun speaking out for reasons I'll get into later. 

I've never met them face to face. Everything I know about them is from briefings, documents, and one secure video session that I honestly wish I had skipped. But it lines up with too many independent data points to just shrug off as somebody’s pet theory.

The basic story is this. Earth was noticed roughly 2 billion years ago, long before anything walked around on land. Not because we’re special, but because we tripped a sensor. Or rather life tripped their sensors. You see, The Council is not a single species. It is a collective of several advanced interstellar maybe even interdimensional civilizations that run long term surveys of stars and planets the way we run spy satellites. Huge distributed arrays of instruments, working together, watching thousands of star systems at once, for millions of years at a time. Their gear probably makes the James Webb telescope look like a kid's backyard telescope.

About 2 billion years ago those instruments picked up biosignatures here, chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere that meant something was alive here. Atmospheric composition like free oxygen and methane, spectral fingerprints, chemical disequilibria that scream “there’s metabolism happening down there!"" you know, the basics. At that point Earth went into a database as “interesting, revisit later”.

Standard procedure for them when a world looks promising is pretty boring from their point of view. They send automated probes. Not big crewed ships like you see in sci-fi movies, just small, tough, very smart machines. Those probes come in, mostly target the oceans, and set up self replicating facilities on the seafloor. Those facilities use local materials to build more facilities, more probes, craft that can operate underwater, in the air, in near space, and eventually avatars that can interact with whatever life evolves. These biological or rather, biomechanical avatars are what some people who claim to have been abducted have likely experienced.  Though they do have what we would call ASI, these beings are not gods, they are technology and they aren't perfect, they make mistakes, glitch out, etc. 

The reason they base all of that underwater for a simple reason. The bottom of an ocean does not care about ice ages, political empires, climate swings or wars. Temperatures and pressures change slowly over what long periods of time. Its a fairly stable environment and for much of human history has been mostly inacessible. Speaking of time, we Earth humans tend to think in terms of nothing longer than the current human lifespan. And when pondering non-human intelligence we like to think in terms of deep space, distance and light years but we seldom consider the lifespan and concept of time for a post-biological species could be quite different than outs. Only our most astute thinkers in the realms of geology, palentology and cosmology think in terms of millions or billions of years. Geologic epochs, cosmological history. That is childsplay for The Council which has a different concept of time, more concerned with deep time, millions of years at a stretch. As such their infrastructure is designed for that. 

So yes, a lot of the TMOs (transmedium objects) and impossible accelerations you have heard about are just their hardware doing its job. Maintenance, observation, sampling. Nothing heroic. The warp bubble/Alcubierre effect was probably mastered by them before our solar system even existed. It's old tech for them. Kinda like the wheel is for us. Also, no, we are not the center of anyone’s universe. There are about a billion planets in our galaxy that are more or less like Earth. Some just have microbes. Some have more complex life. A smaller subset of those have or once had civilizations. We are just one more entry, a fairly recent one in cosmological terms, in a very large survey.

Once early humans started doing interesting things, we moved from “planet with life” to “planet with potential”. They have watched this same story unfold in slightly different ways around a thousand times from what I understand. Chemistry leads to biology, biology creates technology. Tool use, language, agriculture, cities, industry, energy, space travel. Somewhere in there you always hit the same fork. Either the species figures out how not to blow itself to pieces with the energy densities it increasingly has access to such as nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, anti-matter and more exotic matter/energy, or it wipes itself out.

Our situation worried them. We are a little paradox: extremely good at cooperation and also extremely good at organized violence. Our aggression stood out. Cooperation plus violence isn’t unique, but we’re very, very good at both. And once you get to things like nuclear power, that combo tends to end very badly. They'd seen plenty of variations of that play out over at least a few billion years.

About 10,000 years ago our trajectory towards that became clear and there was a major argument inside the Council about what, if anything, to do with us. One side said the odds favored self destruction once we discovered and weaponized atomic level technologies. The other side argued we were worth saving or at least worth understanding better. The compromise was an experiment. One which has ramifications as to why all of this has been hidden for so long.

Roughly 65,000 humans were removed from Earth and relocated to what is basically a preserve on a planet around the star you know as 82 Eridani. Internally we called those people Erids. That star is in our catalogs if you feel like looking it up, but the details of the target planet are not public for obvious reasons.

The Erids were started in a kind of controlled paradise. Their world has large dispenser systems that can produce whatever basic material needs they have. Food, clothing, tools, building materials, entire strucures for habitation. Think Star Trek replicators scaled up and wired into the environment. In that setup nobody starves, nobody is homeless in the way we understand it, nobody spends their life chasing money just to meet needs. This was just the Erids natural reality.

The point from The Council's view was to remove material scarcity from the equation and see what humans do and achieve when they are not spending most of their energy bashing each other over the head over resources. Meanwhile, the rest of us stayed here on the control planet, dealing with scarcity, ownership, money, hoarding, and the rise of socio-political systems based on scarcity: all of the things that define Earth civilization.

The result, according to what we were briefed, is that the Erids are now around 5,000 years ahead of us technologically, averaged out. Same species, same basic biology, same starting point, completely different trajectory because of conditions. Nature vs nurture on a cosmic scale. For most of their history they Erids thought they were native to that world. They only found out the truth roughly a century ago in our time. They learned that they were uplifted, that their ancestors were taken from Earth, that they have cousins here.

Once they knew that, some of them started coming back to visit the original branch. This is where their history intersects the some of the UFO stories you know. The “aliens” that look almost exactly human are just that. Human. They are not hybrids, not clones, not secretly angels or demons. They are Erids, born around another star, showing up here after being given a 10,000 year head start. They have in some cases met with leaders of certain countries and at least two U.N. Secretary Generals (both deceased).

Now we get to why this has been buried for 80 some years.

You have to think like a senior US official in the 1940s and 1950s. World War II has just ended, the Cold War is starting, everything is viewed through capitalism versus communism. Then someone puts a briefing in front of you that says, in essence, there is a group of humans living on another world who have no money, no private ownership in the way we structure it, automatic systems that meet their basic needs, and in that environment they advanced thousands of years faster than we have. The men who built what we now call the legacy program in the US that sounded less like “interesting anthropological data” and more like “a walking, talking advertisement for space communism.” It looked like proof that communism works better than the system they were trying to defend. That and the ramifications of what could happen if THAT ever got out terrified them more than the existence of aliens did, though to be fair they plenty had their worldview rocked by the latter too.

So the core of the cover up has never just been “aliens” or even their technologies. It has been the systemic implications. The idea that scarcity and ownership are not hard coded into reality, that they are one possible way to run a society, and maybe not the optimal one. That was seen as an existential political threat in the 1940s and 1950s and some of the people who grew up in that mindset are still steering parts of the program today. 

Now add in the famous crash-retrieval incidents. Roswell '47, Kecksburg '65, a handful of other retrievals around the U.S. and around the world. What we were told is that most of those were not accidents. They were tests and gifts. The Council, with Erid input, allowed certain craft and systems to fall into human hands in a controlled way. Enough intact technology that a very motivated and capable society could learn from it, not enough that it would instantly rewrite everything.

 In fact the Kecksburg landing, it wasn't called a crash internally, was a direct result of a meeting and gift agreement made at Holloman AFB the year prior. The idea was to see who did what with it. Who could figure it out, who kept it secret, who tried to share, who tried to weaponize it, who panicked. Based on those results, the plan was to pick one primary human partner to act as the main interface for full Council contact and to begin a managed process of reunifying Earth humans with the Erids and introducing us to the wider community.

You can argue whether that is a good way to do it. I am just telling you that is the framework I saw laid out.

In the 1980s-90s during a brief period when the Cold War ended there was a push to finally disclose much of this. This was initially proposed at meeting between then U.S. President Ronald Reagan and then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1986. Also discussed was getting rid of nuclear weapons as had been urged by The Council. In the end it was decided to wait. There were two more U.S. pushes for disclosure between then and the 2017 New York Times article. One during the Clinton administration and another during the transition between the Obama and first Trump presidency.

Now for the part that put a clock on all of this stuff you've been hearing about 2027 etc....

About three years ago, a species that is hostile to the Council found out about the Earth project. They are not part of the collective. They resent the way the Council handles in younger civilizations as they themselves felt victimized by the Council. They also resent the credit the Council gets for “successful” cases. I have heard them described as the jealous neighbors who would rather break your toys than watch you win. 

Yes, we sometimes joke about this stuff because again, it's the only way to stay sane with this everyday knowledge and integrate it into your civilian life of thanksgiving dinner, xmas shopping, taking the kids to soccer practice etc.  Just as an aside, ever consider how two of the biggest holidays of they year involve gluttony (Thanksgiving) and overconsumption (Black Friday)? When you have the knowledge many have within the program stuff that is taken for granted seems really weird and a symptom of the now, forced scarcity of our current system.

Anyway back to the aliens... The hostile group I mentioned decided to spoil the experiment.

This species is ahead of us technologically but far behind the Council. Though they also inhabit a relatively nearby star cosmologically speaking, their travel is slower, less elegant and has to take place in stages, think of it as space ""island hopping"" which is why the lead time is so long. You probably want to know what they look like. Physically, based on the descriptions we saw, they are about five feet tall, segmented bodies, multiple limbs, basically ant like in overall form. Nothing subtle or humanoid about them.

They launched an expedition toward Earth with the stated goal of making a mess. Cause chaos here, damage the experiment, and embarrass the Council by showing they cannot protect their own projects due to internal disagreements. Basically exploiting internal fissures, turning small cracks of understanding in The Council into canyons, thus destroying it. That's their hope at least. The transit time means for us they are expected to arrive in roughly two years from now, the 2027 holiday present NO ONE asked for.

That news triggered a major debate within the Council. One group said, the rules say non interference, we watch and record what happens, even if it is ugly, as we had done in the past. The other group said, we effectively created this situation by tagging and monitoring this world, we have a moral obligation not to just watch a civilization we have been studying get smashed by somebody else’s grudge. If the Council showed up in force it would not be much of a fight. Their technology relative to the ant species is like a modern carrier group versus skilled archers on sailboats. The whole thing would be over quickly and it would also completely blow the point of letting a young species find its own way. It would also be a tremendous blow to the human ego which The Council is well aware of.

So they arrived at a compromise. No direct Council fleets defending Earth. No obvious intervention. Instead, they would quietly arm us.

What they chose to give us are things they roughly call scalar phase weapons. Our vocabulary is not great here. They are not just high power lasers. They interact with fields we do not fully understand or really have names for yet, shift phases, dump huge amounts of energy from the vacuum into very specific volumes of spacetime without a conventional bright beam or explosion. Compared to our current directed energy weapons, they are an enormous leap. As someone who spent years working with lasers and optics systems, I can tell you they sit so far off our current tech tree that if you saw the damage assessments from a pulse without context you would think they were misprints. But compared to Council weapons, they are nerf guns, training wheels per-se.

Anyway, that decision set off another big argument, both among them and among us. The obvious concern was simple. Once the external threat is gone, what stops us from turning these things on each other the same way we took nuclear power and turned it into thousands of warheads aimed at our own cities?

On the US side there were people saying exactly that. And some members of The Council argued that if we on Earth roll out scalar systems across arsenals, the first real test after the bugs are gone will likely be some crisis where two human governments start lighting each other up with technology they we do not fully understand.

The counter argument, which won, was that species level survival has to come first. If humanity gets wiped out by someone else’s petty feud, then the entire debate is academic. Also, if humans fight this off themselves instead of watching the Council show up and save the day, they will meet the wider community as people who actually did something, not as rescued primitives. Human ego intact. And kill switch if you will, has been built into the tech to disable it after the conflict which The Council sees us winning. If we then decide to use these weapons against each other they'll simply be disabled until we humans have learned enough to disable the kill-switch which could be thousands of years from now for all I know.

So against a lot of internal resistance, the Council has been quietly providing scalar phase systems to several blocs, not just the US. The list I saw included the United States, China, the European Union through specific channels, Russia, and Brazil. Those systems are being integrated into space platforms, aircraft, and undersea assets. Testing is happening in remote places and high altitudes, often disguised as other things. Most of the people physically working on it think it is an advanced homegrown black program. Only a very small circle in each capital sees the full context. I got to see pieces of that picture shortly before I was pushed into “retirement”, which is a polite way of saying I stopped being convenient. That is as specific as I am willing to get.

There is one more reason I am writing this now, after pondering it for a long time, and it is more personal than the two year clock.

A friend of mine, someone I worked closely with inside the program, another EO specialist, had been talking quietly years ago about going to Congress. Not with everything, they were not suicidal. Just enough to force a real closed door hearing in the Senate, get the true nature of certain SAPs acknowledged on paper, make it harder to bury the whole subject under jokes and career threats.

Over as year ago I got word that they died. The official explanation has been vague and unsatisfying. “Medical complications” on a trip to a black site in the Indian Ocean. Those medical complications do not match what I know about their health, then it became ""an accident at home” with no details anyone will put in writing. People who would normally be candid went very quiet very fast. Maybe it was just bad luck. People do die suddenly. But given the threats which are known about within certain IC sectors when one is associated with this subject, I don't know for sure. What I do know is that the last long conversation I had with them was about whether it was worth trying to talk to certain congressional staffers for a certain Senator.

After hearing recent news confirming publicly much of what I know to be true privately I stopped telling myself I would wait and see how things played out. Life is short.

So here we are. Some stranger on the internet telling you an unbelievable story you are free not to believe.

With roughly two years on the clock and the current rate of leaks and “whistleblowers” and half disclosures, it is very unlikely they keep all of this under wraps until the first time something openly not from here appears in our sky or our orbit. At some point before that happens, at least one major government, maybe more, is going to go public in a controlled way. My guess would be China or the US, but it could be one of the others on that scalar weapon list. You will likely get a very carefully worded announcement about unidentified aerial phenomena, about contact with “non human intelligences”, about new defensive technologies and unprecedented international cooperation. It will be designed to manage panic and control the story.

What you probably will not hear in the first round of briefings is the part about the Erids, the economic implications of their society's existence, the billion other habitable planets, the undersea infrastructure that has been here longer than we have had bones. You will not see anyone step up to a podium and say “oh by the way, there is a branch of humanity that grew up without the idea of money and scarcity ten thousand years ago and advanced five millennia past us”.

That is why I am dumping this here, where people can ignore it, laugh at it, or save it and see how it ages.

Like I said, do not have to believe me. I'm not here to sell a book, go on podcasts, be on Tv or do UFO lectures/ Treat this as fiction if that makes you more comfortable. What I am really trying to do is get you to think past the kiddie pool questions. “Are UFOs real” ""Are the NHI good or evil?"" is not the interesting part. The far more interesting questions are what happens to this planet once everyone knows we are being watched, that we have cousins around another star, that some of the basic assumptions we built our societies around were just one option, not a fundamental law of nature.

If in a year or two you start hearing officials talk about “our cousins among the stars” or “civilizations far older than ours” and “new non kinetic systems” and “shared planetary defense”, remember this post and see how well it fits. Look, the bugs are coming either way. The Council is not going to save us directly. They already handed out the tools and they are watching to see what we do with them.

The part that is still up to us is what kind of world we build if we get through it. Will we all go back to work and beat each other over the head with really advanced sticks or do we achieve a more enlightened potential?

That is all I have.

Dating apps don't really seem to work well for me, so I'm here!

What I'm looking for:

I want genuine connection. I love talking about the mundane things and the deep things too, and I also love being able to switch between the two easily.

I also greatly value intention and effort. I also think the desire to grow together is a really important aspect of a relationship.

I want someone to adore! I'm very obsessed with the idea of doing the most for my eventual partner. I want to lasso the moon for a partner (if you get the reference, lmk!)

There's other literary romances I can think of that I'm drawn to, in particular, Natasha and Pierre from War and Peace. They were friends first and both came from very sad circumstances regarding romance but they fell in love.

Physically I prefer a slimmer build, whether or not you're athletic doesn't matter as much to me! I tend to prefer darker haired people but this is not a strict preference.

I'm comfortable with ages 22-31 or just a little outside of this range for the right person.

Intellectually, I prefer if you're college educated and still curious! (Bonus points if you're a lover of the humanities) I would like it if you have your own career goals and are actively working towards them.

I'm open to an LDR but please be within the United States. Ideally I would prefer a life long partnership but I know that doesn't happen overnight and it will take work from both of us.

About me:

I'm ADHD (and probably on the spectrum. I tend to hyperfixate on my interests but a few have cropped up over time and stuck with me. One of those is specialty coffee. I'm a huge nerd when it comes to excellent coffee, and I'm very lucky to live near a truly *world class* shop. Another interest is Tolkien; I got really into LOTR as a teenager but never read the main series until college. After that I became invested and read the Silmarillion and a bunch of other work by him too. I've also been known to enjoy reading court filings for fun, I've tried to tell people it's not as nerdy as it sounds but they don't believe me. I really enjoy it though!

My most recent hyperfixation has been ballroom dancing, mostly because I read almost all of war and peace, and I became obsessed with the idea of dancing a proper waltz. But I've found the activity to be wonderful exercise and helps me work through my innate wallflowerness.

As far as my politics go, I'm a progressive. It kind of started as a joke in high school geography where I would pick the communist countries to give a report on them but then I got introduced to actual American leftists like Eugene Debs and I was sold. A wonderful history teacher really helped me start to think for myself. I care about the world around me being a better place, and I hope you do too!

I love traveling and sincerely want to do more throughout life.

I consider myself a Christian.

Thank you for reading all of this! I'd really like to hear what your favorite song is right now so I know you've read this message. I don't tend to reply to people who fail to read through the post.

I am now happy to say I have been free from pericarditis for the past 9 months with no flare ups. It does get better! ❤️‍🩹 stay hopeful you will heal! 

Things I noticed and had to give up:
Caffeine & alcohol these would cause my largest issues.

I had to slowly reintroduce caffeine started with tea and worked my way back to coffee and occasional lattes. This was only after I was free for 5 months. I did not want a relapse. Same with alcohol. I started have hard seltzers occasionally at parties after 5 months free.


I’m vegetarian and don’t eat dairy but realized my diet was way too high in fat. I learned that fat can keep virus in the body for longer. My cardiologist thought that my pericarditis was long Covid related. I reevaluated my diet and ate more fruit, veggies and starches.

I also took 2 supplements 
- hawthorn berry (amazing for the heart) specifically Gaia Herbs Hawthorn Supreme. I found on Amazon.
- Vitamin C with rosehip (specifically Vimergy Micro-C® Vitamin C )


Other things I tried:
-Acupuncture (honestly I don’t think this helped my heart at all but holy cow mentally it helped me calm down a lot)
- red light therapy (not sure if this helped but at my most desperate I used red light therapy daily but heck if it helped even 1% I was willing. 


Hope this can help some heal or give some hope!

a little back story, i started vaping 9 years ago. on November 9th, i woke up one morning (still vaping at this point) and got out of bed. keep in mind, i was hungover from drinking and took an adderall (never an issue for me). anyways, get out of bed, feel great, walk outside, go to get coffee with my bf, totally normal. (did see someone dead laying on the road, I live in NY.) 

  
anyways, start walking around after the coffee and I feel extremely weird. go home and try to shower, still feel freaking weird. look around outside and things feel… fake. (first DPDR episode). I completely panic, PANIC, thought I was dying, literally went and banged on my neighbors doors to help me. called 911.  fine. panic attack. blood sugar was low but besides that everything else was normal when the EMS tested me. but this felt like what was my first panic attack ever. 

  
since that moment, my anxiety skyrocketEd and I’ve been fixating on WTF caused it. anyways, I quit vaping the second I had that panic attack. 

  
since quitting, my anxiety has been horrible and I’ve had depression too (never dealt w this, my life is amazing) I feel hopeless and like I cannot handle life and I’d rather die. sad. some days are better though. 2 weeks ago I remember feeling fine, but then I saw a psychiatrist and she prescribed me lexapro. that sent me into a spiral. since then I have had really bad anxiety. only took it once. 

  
anyways. my withdrawals, on top of this panic attack, and quitting my BC have been horrible. but the main thing causing my anxiety is that DPDR. I now feel constantly OUT OF IT. brain fog and just weird. looking for some reassurance and hope. this will be my last post. need to focus on myself and getting better and my mental health. thanks for listening! any advice helps.

Somewhere between the airport, the tuk-tuk, and the third cup of coffee, dehydration sneaks in like a thief. The body begs for water, and the priced like fine wine or a suspicious tap that whispers promises of regret. The best travel hack in this gritty ballet of survival is simple, unassuming, and wildly effective. The collapsible travel water bottle.

It’s the kind of tool every traveler eventually learns to worship. Lightweight, flexible, and engineered to fold into itself like origami, it saves space while outsmarting the overpriced bottles of airport purgatory. Fill it up before boarding and sidestep the USD 6 trap disguised as “spring water.” Once empty, it collapses flat and disappears into a bag, waiting for the next refill like a loyal companion. The good ones run between USD 15 and USD 25 on Amazon, built from BPA-free silicone tough enough to survive drops, desert heat, or the bottom of a rucksack soaked in spilled beer.

It’s not about staying hydrated in some Instagram-influencer way. It’s about function, grit, and the quiet joy of sticking it to overpriced airport kiosks. A collapsible bottle turns travel into an act of defiance. Hydration without dependency, control without clutter. Pair it with a compact water purifier or UV filter (around USD 40) and it becomes an all-access pass to hydration anywhere, from the backstreets of Marrakech to the hiking trails of Patagonia.

Every journey has its survival rules. This one earns its place at the top because it solves the simplest problem travelers face. Thirst without adding weight, waste, or worry. While others line up for overpriced bottles or gamble with hotel tap water, the smart traveler unfolds salvation from a pocket. The best travel hack isn’t always about beating the system. Sometimes it’s just about staying human long enough to enjoy the view, one refill at a time.

So far my coffee is good but rarely great. I also roast 50% decaf. 

What do I need to learn to make my roasts great? Especially with the insight that Artisan provides. I'll be honest that when I look at a roast profile it doesn't give me any useful insight.

# The Path Less Traveled

The next day was spent deciding on provisions. Of course, the King and Queen were not going to let us leave without throwing another party.

One thing I noticed was that Nyla had not lost any respect from the troops or the people. Even without the title of Crown Princess, she commanded the room.

I had also met her brother, Prince Kaelen. I rather liked him. He was a little younger than Nyla, but a natural leader. He had been away on diplomatic missions when I was here last. Seeing him with the King, I knew Prydia Solaris was in good hands.

We also found out that, as far as the Crown was concerned, Skia was the rightful ruler of all of the Shadow Lands. The King agreed to send patrols into the Shadow Lands to protect it and keep it from becoming a hideout for bandits.

Skia was grateful for the King's patrols. She admitted to Nyla and myself that she did not feel like a ruler. She had no subjects and didn't want any, and had no desire to possess the land. She was happy just to be a part of our family.

We provisioned ourselves, only taking what we needed since we would be walking the whole way.

Having created a hand-drawn map while we were in Sanctuary, we planned to cut off a good deal of the trip by crossing several large bodies of water. We weren't going to be taking many roads due to the fact there were no direct connections. We would have to go through large cities if we wanted to go by road, adding months to an already long journey.

**The Lake**

I had seen lakes. There was a large riverbed lake near my home farm. On the trip between the Pit and Prydia Solaris, I walked along the shore of a couple. And of course, Nyla had seen and played in lakes near the castle, both as a child and as an adult.

Skia had never seen a large body of water. The Shadow Lands were semi-arid.

You could imagine her excitement as we crested a hill and saw water filling the valley beneath us.

First, she stared in disbelief. Then she began to run around frantically, as if unsure what to do. We had been walking for a while and were in need of a swim to wash away the grime of the trek.

""Skia, do you want to swim?"" I asked as we watched her run around.

She stopped and looked at me.

""Paul, I've never seen so much water. Can we swim in it? Oh, please don't tease me. Can we please swim?"" Skia asked, her tail wagging furiously.

Nyla said, ""I don't see why not. But if you've never been in a body of water that big, you need to wait for us. There might be currents. Okay?""

Skia nodded her head and agreed. ""Yes, yes, yes! I will wait for you... at the water's edge.""

With that, she took off towards the water at full speed. She was impossibly fast.

Nyla and I took off running behind her, but we realized quickly there was no way we were catching her. I might be able to outrun her in the long run, but at such a short distance, I had no hope.

Skia skidded to a stop at the beach. Nyla and I arrived a moment later. Breathing hard and laughing, we dropped our packs. Before either woman could react, I grabbed both of them and jumped into the water with them.

It was early spring, but the water was surprisingly warm. We played in the water, splashing and swimming. Skia decided she wanted to run in the shallows.

After asking her to not go far, Nyla swam over to me. Her eyes were shining. My breath caught in my throat.

""My Princess, you are so beautiful,"" I confessed. ""I love you so much. I never want to live without you in my life.""

Nyla wrapped her arms around my neck and said, ""I love you too, my smelly wolf thingy.""

We kissed. It wasn't the first time, but it seemed we were pouring our passion into this kiss. It lingered and became more intense. Nyla wrapped her legs around my waist beneath the water. My excitement was evident.

Nyla pulled back, a mischievous smile on her face.

""It appears someone is very happy,"" she said, smiling.

Then I looked up to see where Skia was. She was sitting on the beach, her back to us.

Nyla turned to see where I was looking and called out, ""Skia, is everything okay?""

""Everything's fine! I'm not looking. I'm not looking,"" Skia said, sounding embarrassed.

""Skia, can you see through the water?"" I asked.

""...Yes. But I promise I'm not. I have my head turned.""

Nyla and I started to laugh. ""It's okay, Skia. You didn't do anything wrong.""

Nyla smiled and whispered to me, ""Later, my smelly wolf thingy. We will need to be more careful, okay?""

**Slavers!**

We walked West, along the shore, looking for a ferry ride across the lake. The map we had showed a small town, indicating a ferry there as well.

Skia began her pebble-dancing growl.

Nyla asked her, ""What's wrong?""

""People. Maybe fifty. But something is wrong. Many of them are scared. I hear children crying,"" Skia said, somehow speaking and growling at the same time. She was looking at a hill. ""Over there. Heading in the same direction as us.""

We chose to crest the hill keeping low to remain undetected. As we spotted the caravan, my blood ran cold.

""Slavers!"" I hissed.

I felt Nyla's hand on my shoulder. ""There's too many of them for us to take in the open. It's almost nightfall. They'll have to stop and make camp. We can formulate a plan and attack them after dark.""

Nyla's voice had a hardness about it I had never heard from her before.

As we watched, the caravan circled up for the night. It was then we realized the caravan carried slaves and other wagons, probably joined together for safety. None of us had a problem dealing with them if they tried to stop us.

After making our plans, we waited for nightfall. They had a large fire in the center. The slavers and the other members of the caravan appeared to segregate from each other.

Nyla and Skia, using their stealth abilities, crept up to the slave wagons. I came up to the merchant wagons. The merchants all had their eyes on the slavers and weren't paying as much attention to the outward-facing side.

Once I got close enough to a guard who was standing on the wagon, paying too much attention to the slaver, I reached up. I used *Chain Breaker* to place the spike against his throat.

He froze.

I whispered, ""You obviously aren't with the slavers. Why would you ride with them? And speak quietly. I'd hate to cut your head off by accident.""

The guard explained that something hit their caravan and they lost several wagons. Then the slavers showed up, offering to ride together, there being safety in numbers. Of course, you can't trust a slaver, so they were told to keep one eye on them.

""We plan on taking the slavers. And freeing the slaves. You have a problem with that?"" I asked. I added, ""Or any of the rest of your people?""

""Not at all,"" the guard whispered. ""We weren't planning on riding with them after tonight anyway. We're well out of the badlands. We have no agreement with them other than to caravan together. We promised not to hit them, they promised not to hit us. We don't have a mutual defense pact. Kill all the bastards as far as I'm concerned.""

I told him to spread the word we were going to hit the slavers. If they didn't interfere, we wouldn't bother them. Then I let him go. I wasn't sure that was the right decision, but we'd soon find out.

I saw the signal from Nyla that she was in place. A quick flash of reflected firelight from her sword. Then, from the merchant side of the caravan, all of the guards turned their backs on the slave wagons. They had their total focus on the outside of the circle.

Smiling, I began to walk in between the wagons toward the center of the circle, carrying my Halberd like a walking stick. I walked as though I was going to warm myself.

There were about ten guards from the slaver's side warming themselves. No weapons drawn. Not paying attention.

It took me less than a few minutes to kill them all.

It wasn't even a real fight. *Chain Breaker* cut through them and their armor as though they were soft butter.

There were a couple of archers on the top of the slave wagons. They didn't get a single shot off before Nyla cut them down, appearing out of nowhere, her sword as effective at cutting as *Chain Breaker*.

Skia transformed into the Shadow Hound. She hit the front wagon that carried the rest of the guards and knocked it on its side. She tore the side off like she was opening old parchment. Her head went in, a few screams, and it was over.

All the slavers were dead.

I walked over to the first cart. I stuck *Chain Breaker* in between two lengths of chain and snapped them in half.

Stock up on easy-to-make breakfasts, lunches, dinners and even desserts that provide the essential energy your body needs to get through a stressful emergency situation.

# How 4Patriots Works

With prearranged survival food kits, bulk servings of specific favorites, specialized bundles, energy drinks, bars and more, 4Patriots makes it easy to stock up on favorites to keep your family fed through whatever life throws your way. 

While most of their preselected food kits are differentiated by the length of time they’re meant to sustain a single person, from 72-hours to a year, 4Patriots recommends starting with a kit for each family or household member to feel confident that everyone is covered when disaster strikes (their 4-Week Survival Food Kit is a great starting point). The company does specify that their meals are meant to provide the much-needed energy and nutrients you need during extenuating circumstances, but they are not meant to be used to meet your average nutritional needs during normal daily life. 

Once you’ve decided which foods to order directly from [4Patriots.com](https://trk.rebootmarketing.com/aff_c?offer_id=200&aff_id=1531), you can decide if you want to place a one-time order or subscribe to save five percent and receive your order on a recurring basis. 4Patriots’ food is crafted using fresh whole grains and high-quality produce, plus packaged and shipped all within the United States before arriving directly at your door via FedEx or UPS. 

Your kit is delivered in a water-resistant, low-profile plastic tote box with handles to make it easy to store discreetly and safely. But the real secret to how 4Patriots helps ensure your food stays secure for years is their cutting-edge low-heat dehydration technology that locks in flavor and freshness, plus their triple-layer Mylar® pouches that provide superior protection against air, light and moisture. Plus, every disaster-resistant pouch is “cold-sealed” to ensure damaging heat doesn’t spoil your supply. This multi-step process helps your survival food stays shelf-stable for five to 25 years!

Keep your food in dry, darkly-lit stable temperatures and you’ll be good to go if and when the need arises. When you are ready to eat your meals, you simply need to boil water, simmer your selection for a few minutes and then serve for no mess, no stress food security in any situation.

# 4 Patriots Survival Food Kit Options 

4Patriots offers plenty of meal kits and extras to choose from, but one of their most popular products is the 3-Month Emergency Food Supply Kit. This best-selling kit comes with 688 total servings that provide about 1,500 calories per day, which is intended to support your needs in emergencies versus everyday life. 

The 3-month kit includes a variety of 24 unique recipes, and you’ll be happy to see some patriotic-themed comfort favorites on the menu, like America’s Finest Mac & Cheese, Cowboy Rice & Beans, and Grammy’s Sweet Oatmeal. You’ll even get dessert like chocolate pudding and real milk (in powdered form) among other classics so you can feel good about what you’re feeding your family—even when a crisis hits.

The company only sources high-quality ingredients and proudly hand packs the meals in their warehouse in Utah, which is Safe Quality Food (SQF) certified for the highest food quality standards. 

In addition to the pre-selected bundles, you can also supplement your supply with customizable kits, energy bars and drinks, dairy and egg packs, freeze-dried fruits and veggies, and even coffee.

# 4Patriots’ Nutritional Information

The survival food kits from 4Patriots are designed to provide the energy and sustenance you need during stressful emergency situations, but they’re not intended to deliver the complete, balanced diet you need in everyday life. 

On average, the time-based kits provide around 1,500 calories a day for one person, which is less than many people need for an extended period of time. Since the average adult needs around 2,000 calories a day for optimal nutrition and energy, 4Patriots recommends that you supplement with additional items available on their site or in your pantry.

# 4Patriots Pricing

Since they offer a wide variety of emergency food kits and supplemental items, the pricing for 4Patriots food can vary widely as well. The popular three-month survival food kit costs $699.95 before any discounts, while you can get the 72-Hour Survival Food Kit for only $29.95, which is a great way to try it out before buying more in bulk. 

4Patriots provides free shipping within the contiguous U.S. for orders over $97, and they also have a subscription plan that provides a five percent savings on every recurring order. 

If paying in full up-front seems daunting, you can choose to pay in installments with their Shop Pay plan that makes breaking up the total cost over biweekly or monthly payments more manageable.  

# 4Patriots Specials

Check out the “Deals” page on [4Patriots.com](https://trk.rebootmarketing.com/aff_c?offer_id=200&aff_id=1531) to find a selection of specially priced products, and make sure to subscribe for front-row access to any site-wide promos or savings they offer. 

# 4Patriots Money Back Guarantee 

4Patriots also stands by their products with a 365-day money back guarantee. If you’re unsatisfied for any reason within the first year after your purchase, you can get your money back minus return shipping.

# About 4Patriots

Founded in 2008, 4Patriots is dedicated to helping Americans across the country to be empowered and prepared for anything life throws their way. Beyond supplying a wide selection of products to help people become more self-reliant and independent, 4Patriots is also committed to giving back to the community, particularly active military, veterans and their families in their mission to promote freedom for all.

# Comparing 4Patriots to Other Survival Food Providers

Here’s a look at how 4Patriots stands out compared to the competition:

# 4Patriots vs. My Patriot Supply 

Both of these companies are prominent suppliers of emergency preparedness products with a variety of long- and short-term emergency survival food kits and supplements. While My Patriot Supply offers similar recipe options and time-based bundles at comparable prices, their 30-day return policy pales in comparison to the 365-day money back guarantee from 4Patriots. This can make a big difference when you’re purchasing emergency food that you may not even touch for at least a year. 

# 4Patriots vs. ReadyWise

With a similar focus on emergency food kits as part of their larger selection of preparedness products, ReadyWise offers similar bundles with a slightly higher daily calorie count. But while their recipes might look similar at first glance, 4Patriots is often rated higher when it comes to overall taste and flavor, with a greater variety of meals as well. 4Patriots also offers more affordable pricing on their kits compared to the higher cost of ReadyWise, plus only 4Patriots offers free shipping on orders over $97. ReadyWise does have a 30-day return policy, but they charge a $15 restocking fee in addition to return shipping, while 4Patriots has a generous 365-day return policy with no restocking fee, making it the clear choice for worry-free shopping.

# Bottom Line: Why We Love It

More and more Americans are seeing the value of having food security in emergency situations, and companies like 4Patriots make it easy for anyone to be prepared for anything from power outages to larger-scale natural disasters. With homestyle recipes that remind you of your Grandma’s cooking, we especially appreciate the convenience and comfort that their survival food kits can provide during the most trying times. By combining high-quality ingredients like whole grains with advanced technology for up to a 25-year shelf-life, 4Patriots provides survival meals that mean more than just peace of mind for you and your loved ones…they’re a lifeline.

When the hatch failed to move after the usual automatic time, he nodded to himself and went to sit on his bunk.  As he tried to regulate his breathing to be deep and slow, despite the anxiety that was brewing inside him, he started to unbutton his khaki uniform shirt.

As he shrugged off the shirt and draped it over the back of the nearby chair, his eyes fixed on the top book of the stack in his doorway.  He paused and shook his head gently, his thoughts going to Ben Holiday's plight in the story on the printed pages.

""All you had to do was unite a magical kingdom,"" he ruefully told the book.

He sighed and reached for the medical diagnostic unit sitting at the foot of his bunk, then started to unpack the leads and contact pads.  As the holographic location projections indicated the correct placements of the pads, Henry carefully, and somewhat hesitantly, peeled off the covers from the adhesive gel and stuck them over his torso and at his temples.

The diagnostic unit chimed as it recognized inputs and automatically began its startup routine.  

Henry watched the progress bar change to biometric readouts and sighed again.

He swung his feet up onto the bunk and then lay back, still trying to calm his breathing.  Henry's hand reached out to the small table surface near the bed that seemed far too empty without its books, and grasped the metal box containing the earpiece.

As he fiddled with getting the tricky lid to swing open on its sliding hinge, he spoke resignedly to the air.  ""Vicki?  I'm ready.  Are you getting the bio-readings?""

The AI's answering words came from the air in Henry's cabin, ""Yes, Captain.  They're coming through fine.  You're sure you're up to this now?  We won't likely be clear of the asteroids for a couple more hours. You could take a nap and get some rest first...""

Henry gave a quiet ""heh,"" as he dug the neural link out of the metal box, then tucked the box back on the table surface.  He flattened out the netting around the earpiece as he answered.  ""No, Vicki, I don't think I can.  It seems to me that you shouldn't keep a recently freed God waiting, right? Even a digital one?""

Vicki didn't answer right away, and when she did, her words carried a worried tone.  ""No... I guess not.  Stay safe, sir.""

Henry sighed again, fitting the earpiece into position, but not smoothing the netting into place until he was done answering.  ""I'll do what I can.  You take care too, okay?""

Vicki's response fell on deaf ears, the Captain not able to hear her ""Aye, aye, sir.""


-=-=-=-=-=-


Stars glistened around Henry as he suddenly stood in the midst of the observatory of the palace-temple of Varanasi, and he almost fell over with the abrupt transition from lying in his bunk.   Off in the distance, the red, probing waves of the craft of the Drasalite Empire faced off against the blue and green clumps of the Coalition of Worlds forces which were still rallying from far reaches of their territories.   Here an there, yellow dots seemed to be waypoints for streams of the blue and green ships moving both too and from the front lines of the conflicts.

And deep in Coalition spce, two orbs, slightly larger than any of the yellow, green, or blue shapes, pulsed and glowed with the angry orange light of a setting sun. 

Before Henry could wander over to examine them in more detail, Shiva’s voice sounded from outside of the still-open doorway, echoing slightly and carrying, without booming. “Welcome back, Captain Miller.  Please, do me the favor of coming to join me on the balcony.”

Henry spun to look back at the words, his eyes finding the portal where the dull light spilled in through the portal.   “What?  Oh, of course, Shiva.”  After a second he added, “Um, Lord Shiva…”  

Henry started walking toward the light, which seemed to get close faster than he thought he was traveling across the dark floor.

The voice from afar came with a hint of mirth, “Don’t force a title, Captain.  It is much more important to do what feels right.”  It then added, “And, turn to your right as you enter the hallway.”

Henry chuckled quietly as he stepped through the doorway and turned to his right, heading down the hallway that he seemed to recognize walking along on his first ‘visit’.   He strode across the geometric patterns set into the stone hallway, past the rows of columns that served as walls.  Through the spaces, he could see the gilded dome of the observatory room, which didn’t seem as big from the outside.  Beyond and below, the empty city stretched out in the sunlit haze around the palace-temple.

At the end of the hallway, a wide arch lead out onto a squared off balcony that surrounded the end of the pillared hallway.  As Henry stepped out into the hot, humid air, he saw Shiva’s ashy grey-white form just off to the side, watching the inside of a hemisphere that floated just past the solid stone wall that made a railing around the balcony.  The interior of the hemisphere was a crisp, bright view of asteroids drifting past a spacecraft that was navigating its way through them.

Somehow, the sharp detail of the view of space felt oddly discordant with the haze of the heavy air that permiated the city.  Henry tried to recocile this, but got distracted by recognizing that the gentle, subtle motions of Shiva’s ashy hands matched the swaying movements of the asteroids and must be him steering the anciet bomber in the ‘real’ world.  He couldn’t help himself, and blurted out, “Wait, is this how you… How you navigate?”

Shiva chuckled good-naturedly and asnwered without looking from the curved display, “Only when I need to be precise, Captain.  If we were in empty space, what you call ‘The Dark’, I would use my obervatory to plot the course.  But this…”  Shiva’s lips parted in a small smile to show glistening white teeth, “is a delicate dance, with many participants, and I need to dance within its patterns.”

Henry’s brow furrowed a bit as he focused more on the asteroids flowing past in the view, “As a pilot myself, I know that this manner of chaos takes care to maneuver though, but I would hardly call it a dance…”

Shiva grinned, “Ah, Captain Miller, perhaps you just do not see a wide enough view to recognize the patterns of the dance.  And, perhaps it is unfair for me to discuss it so casually, for I have been watching this dance proceed for far longer than you have been alive.  But ever is it such that the prespectives of Gods and humans- No, I apologize, you consider yourself to be Terrans now, so let me revise my statement.  Ever has it been that the perspectives of Goda and Terrans have differed, and thus caused so much strife within the universe.”

Henry shook his head slightly, “Perhaps that’s so, Shiva, but unfortunately, we Terrans have been the ones who actually do things in the- In our existance.  The bits that I did learn about prophets and major religions of our past seemed to always have kernals of really good intentions that never ended up going as well as they were supposed to.”

Shiva nodded sagely and a somber expression slowly grew on his face. “My point precisely, Captain.  Phophets bring a message of enlightenment, but perhaps put the inflection on the wrong word, or the wrong syllable.  They translate the concept into their own language and mistakenly choose the improper word as the best translation, thus losing or deflecting the the main thrust of the spear of knowledge, thus sending the point into the wrong target.”

The ash-colored hands made a gentle swirl, and the hyperrealistic asteroids in the hemispherical view spun, then came to a gentle stop.  Despite this smooth, and obviously impressive piloting move, Shiva sighed almost sadly, “So many attempts and so few true sucesses, Captain.  That our communication failures of the past have led us to the current Terran situation is a bitter reality that hopefully we can avoid going forward.”

Henry winced and muttered a quiet, “Not this again…” as his shoulders slumped tiredly. 

Shiva’s face started to loose the somber look as he turned his head to look at the Captain with his three eyes, and a small smile started to grow as he spoke, “But of course! You have been helping the Draviatian along the twisting paths of humanity.  Linguisitics and philosophy have been taxing your patience, correct?”    

Henry nodded slowly, as if giving in, “And theological worldviews, as best as I have been able to manage…”
 
Shiva chuckled quietly, “Then you, Captain, have already encountered how difficult it can be to try and explain higher-level concepts to one who doesn’t fully understand.  And, please take no offense when I say that I expect that even when your explanations have been as full and rich as you could make them, that some of those messages have been saved in the Drasalite’s memory in an incorrect way that warped what you said into something unlike what you meant.”

Even as Shiva’s hands continued to pilot the ship, an extra pair of greyish arms suddenly sprang into existence, somehow sharing the same shoulder joint as his steering arms.  The new hands made some odd finger motions and gestures, and a mug of steaming dark liquid began to shimmer in the air between his fingers.  

“Coffee, Captain Miller?  You look like you need it.”

Still a little bit to go. Machine and grinder wise I am set. For my 1 espresso based drink per day in my morning ritual the Bambino I am happy with. Timemore 064s has also been faultless for both espresso and filter. 

I want to put up some picture frames above the coffee machine to add to the space. Or do I put up a shelf above the machine for my Magnolia Mountain cups??

Not sure if I like the cups below the machine but it is very practical and I’m not sure what else to put in the cupboards yet as a display. Wine could also not be on display if I slide the door to the other side.

For those still reading, filter coffee gear is on the left of the cups.

Not sure if she was asking me out of if she was just nervous cause we have an exam coming up/I’m a new person/English isn’t her first language. Practicing for the exam is at least the headline of why we’re meeting up for coffee. 

But the interaction was giving the vibes that that may be a pre-tense. This is also absolutely something I would pull to safely ask a near stranger on my course out. 

We’re both third (final) years in a law degree. Exam next week is basically everyone getting a chance at roleplaying a negotiator. Everyone is a little stressed about this cause our lecturer hasn’t given us clear instructions, but I’ve gained a bit of a reputation since I’ve done stuff similar irl before. I also found a lot of resources online, which is how the girl in question and I started talking.

We’re now (if all works out) getting coffee tomorrow to practice our speeches, and I’m panicking ever so slightly. I’m a tad autistic so unless you tell me very clearly what the intention is, I will be pacing my room trying to figure it out and analyzing EVERYTHING. Did some light instagram stalking too, accidentally got way too excited yesterday evening. 

However, I’m trying to be so super chill, accepting that if this is a date with a productive goal, then yay! But if not, then I’ll at least have made a new friend on my course, have gotten some practice in, AND met someone who is trying to learn my second language (which I am trying to practice more cause it’s slipping away from me)… which is really cool! 

Sorry, this was just a rant. My friends are awesome, but they reality check me either too much or too little… opinions from them also stress me out HARD. So you all are getting my sleep deprived rant.

Santorini is very bright and fresh. It smells like a sparkling peachy, citrus scented bubble bath.  I think anyone who loves fresh fruity notes and feeling bright will love it. If I wore this in the morning I think it would help me feel more awake. 

I received this set free in my Black Friday order from OUAI. St. Barts is still my favorite but that’s because I love tropical scents. I think these two new scents really round out OUAI’s collection so far. They are both likely safe blind buys if you know you love similar fragrance types.

1. What does this specific neighborhood need. (ever have the thought that this neighborhood could really use a starbucks?), and **how to actually test/study that theory?**
2. Micro/Macro understanding of CRE market
3. What makes a great space for patrons + tenants, how do I make it a best place to work/visit?
4. What makes an awesome coffee shop/working lounge, **does this pencil?**
5. What makes a great restaurant, good food/good service/unique space?
6. Make lemonade out of lemons: value add acquisition + builds, significant TI expense to create awesome places, **what CAPEX is worth the $?** Don't want to be the guy who replaces carpet with cheap vinyl wood flooring and charges $2,000/mo.
7. Leasing strategy - different types of tenants that will provide synergy in the asset (if this is even a thing)

Things I don't care for:

1. Capital raising (Debt + Equity - I don't care for how to make the ""deal"" work, just want to make sure it allows for the asset to be purchased/built + profitable)
2. Grant/tax rebate applications

**3) Purely reporting role, I want to be able to make decisions that affect P&L (begrudgingly be responsible asset performance - AKA have some sort of autonomy in creating the ""best"" place)**

1pf6lub,https://i.redd.it/mgrqjwod5g5g1.jpeg,"I was ambivalent, but I did go in store. Bought 6 scents...also, 2 honorable mentions and other thoughts....","I would have loved to get my hands on *Magic in the Air*. But I didn't want it enough to go to the stores that opened at 6 or 7a.m. So, no MITA for me. Maybe they'll release it next year with a regular lid? We can hope.

For the rest of this, I'm basically ignoring the scents that come out each year. So Paris Cafe, Pineapple Mango, the body care candles, etc., I totally skipped. Didn't even really look at them. I'm also skipping all the fall and holiday candles that have been out for a while.

# The Haul

I did mostly go in for the Ice Cream set...As you can see, I did end up buying several from it. 

* **Neopolitan** surprised me. I wasn't sure what to think, but it did smell good to me on cold. So I bought 2. 
* **Glazed Cherries** of course...also had to grab 2. Smells very nice.
* **Gummy Candies** also smelled good but I stuck with just 1 since I really don't need a ton more pineapple scents. 
* **Hot Fudge Drizzle** also smelled good and different from Hot Cocoa & Cream so I did grab just the 1.

I did not buy *Sugar Waffle Cone*...it had literally zero scent in the jar. I also skipped the *Butterscotch* one. It DID smell good in jar but in general, B&BW caramel type candles and I never get along. So even though I was tempted, I skipped it. I know I have at least 2 butterscotch candles in my closet I've never finished.

The store I was at did NOT receive *Vanilla Snowflakes*. And according to another customer who had been at our other store, the other store did not receive it either. (They had a whole shipment due yesterday that did not arrive! Bad timing!)

I was hesitant about **Peppermint Marshmallow**. It was out 3 or 4 years ago for CD (red wax!) and I remember it being weak. But...I had to grab one.

Finally, **Snowday**. I don't believe I've had this one before but in the end I could not leave it behind. If Twisted Peppermint is too strong for you, you might like Snowday. I feel like it also reminds me of something else, but can't name it right now.

# Honorable Mentions

There were a couple that were in my basket at various times but I ended up skipping. They just didn't grab my nose like the ones above. Those included: *Coffee & Donuts* and *Rum Rum Reindeer.* They smelled nice but on cold just didn't have anything really stand out about them. They may burn better, but I was also trying to stick to a budget. And again, based on cold I didn't like them as much as the 6 scents I did buy.

# The Ugly

OMG. *Pizza & Ranch* is as vile as everyone says. I have no idea why on earth...or even how...this got approved. Disgusting is too nice a word. *Chips and Salsa* was also horrid to my nose but not quite as vile as Pizza & Ranch. By comparison, *Popcorn & Slushie* was good...in that compared to the other 2 it was bearable. *Coffee & Donuts* is the definite best smelling one in that group. Surprisingly, the *Dill* candle was pretty good. Not my taste to buy it, but not bad. Especially in comparison to P&R!!!

# The End

So...that was it for me. I know there were others I skipped because I wasn't interested at all. And there are some I would have been more interested in if it wasn't for the size of my stash. But that was it for me this year. 6 scents, 8 candles. And the body wash shown via free item with $10 purchase coupon. Done. If my stores had received Vanilla Snowflake I would have gotten at least 1. If I had stumbled across MITA, I would have gotten it. But...that didn't happen. On the whole I would say I'm underwhelmed this year.

1pf6l2c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pf6l2c,Interview with Saya in Dutch music magazine OOR,"Here is the English translation of the article. I used AI for this, so there could be some errors:


​Introduction
We were there, on Wednesday, April 9, when a new star was born in a packed Amsterdam Tolhuistuin. Just like the entire Dutch music press, for that matter. That evening, Saya Gray exceeded all high expectations. Our reviewer saw ‘a pop star who is totally 2025’. But one with a profound hatred for algorithms, streaming services, and social media. Who, moreover, makes a sport of letting herself be influenced as little as possible by the world around her. Exactly in that way – by completely shutting herself off from the spirit of the times – she made one of the albums of the year. A year she crowned with a show in Paradiso. Main hall. We went to watch again.
​BY STIJN GRUISEN
​‘WHAT DO YOU THINK of my merch?’ We are sitting backstage and Saya Gray holds up a bright pink bag, full of Japanese characters and photos of her cats Genghis and Yeti. ‘Homemade!’ she adds, totally unnecessarily. Before my eyes, on a pink piece of textile, dangles her soul: a Japanese-Canadian multi-instrumentalist and songwriter, full-time cat lady and – above all – quite an oddball. Actually, she doesn't care much for the ‘human world’. Her European tour starts tonight, but secretly she can’t wait until it’s all over and she can go home again. Back to the quiet edge of Toronto, where she runs her own animal shelter, studies her instrument like a monk, and engages in extreme rollerblading for hours a day. A kind of hermit on roller skates, so it appears a moment later when I ask her about her album of the year. Gray looks at me with wide eyes. ‘Phew, that’s a tough one. I am never online, so I never hear anything new unless someone on my team tips me off. I’ve actually been listening to the same Alice Coltrane album for years.’
​Naturally, she is never online. It fits exactly into the picture of the isolated artist who keeps all external influences out the door. ‘It is very human to let yourself be influenced by others. It happens to me too. If I come into contact with something long enough, I take it over. We simply want to belong somewhere, find our people, and we are willing to sacrifice our authenticity for it. It is much easier to go along with a trend than to be a completely isolated weirdo. That literally goes against your survival instinct. When I was growing up, there was no alternative yet. You couldn't go online looking for kindred spirits. Everything about me was weird. Being Asian was weird, being gender-ambiguous was weird… So I was excluded, and not because I chose it.’
​HER LATEST album SAYA is the weirdo's crushing vindication: a shimmering mosaic of pop, soul, indie, and a touch of country, unanimously labeled by the global music press as the alt-pop discovery of the year. But when you hear Gray talk like this, you almost ask yourself: would she realize that herself? ‘I am so deep in my own world that I don't even know exactly how well it's going. But the shows are selling out, so that's nice. Nowadays I sometimes get recognized when I go to get coffee, but otherwise that attention doesn't turn my life upside down or anything. It doesn't get in the way of the art, that is the most important thing. I've seen that happen with a lot of other artists: when you get more attention and money, you start making different choices, making compromises. Often you don't even realize you're doing it.’
​And Gray would know. As the daughter of two musicians, she has been standing firmly in ‘the biz’ with both colorful snowboots her entire life. Dad Charlie was a renowned trumpeter for giants like Aretha Franklin and The Temptations, mother Madoka founded the largest music school in Toronto. From childhood, Saya gave piano lessons, and since she was seventeen she played along as a bassist with Daniel Caesar, Willow Smith, and Liam Payne. ‘That life was so easy. It paid well. I only had to show up when it was expected of me. Playing songs I liked, hanging out with my friends… Why on earth did I stop? I think simply because it was time for something else. Playing bass is only 10 percent of who I am. All the artists I played for saw it too: I wasn't just an instrumentalist. They all encouraged me to go solo. I always knew I had something special, even as a child. You just feel that when you are an artist.’
​‘MOST artists suffer’, she explains. ‘If something like that is channeled well, you get the most beautiful kind of art there is. I feel that suffering too. That is the downside of growing up in an artistic family: mental problems. I've been struggling with it my whole life. Chronic depression, trauma… All kinds of shit. And I had an instrument to translate that suffering into art.’
​And indeed, a few hours later no one can ignore it anymore: here stands an Artist, and you don't have to be Daniel Caesar to be able to see that. As virtuoso as she is casual, Gray and her band steal the heart of Paradiso. On her fluffy seven-league boots, Gray strides across the stage, she sings crystal clear and leaves no opportunity unused to mess around* with her audience. An audience that, by the way, quite... ►

has changed since her breakthrough. ‘In the past, it consisted only of weirdos. Cool ass people, from sixty-year-olds to children. Since my last album, much more of the general public comes to my shows. Many more people around my age, and many Asians. Also very cool. I don't know anyone who has such a crazy following as I do. For many artists, it takes a very long time before they find their audience, but for me, it went fast. They get it all: the poppy shit, the more experimental work. They understand how weird I am.’
​WHOEVER WANTS to understand that must dig further into the archives. Back to her previous mixtapes 19 MASTERS and QWERTY I & II: three flipped-out collages, exactly as chaotic as their placeholder-like titles suggest. ‘The previous albums were literally experiments. I released them without an idea. Without

promo or tour. 19 MASTERS I made when I was completely homeless and sleeping on couches. The QWERTY EPs I made entirely by myself on my computer, with my cat next to me. It became quite popular too; the QWERTY EPs got me quite a large fanbase. I find that really hilarious, it is such strange music.’
​Also among the Amsterdam audience, there are quite a few fans from the very beginning. Just listen to the applause during SHALLOW (PPL SWIM IN SHALLOW WATER): the first song she ever released, recorded on her mobile phone. A nice moment to throw in her life motto once again. ‘You don’t need anything external to make something beautiful.’ Yet she partially abandons her DIY philosophy on her latest album. SAYA was recorded in a regular studio and some songs contain as many as four hundred (!)
​Column 3
guitar tracks. ‘I will always remain a lo-fi girl, but there is also something beautiful in working with the best microphones and recording everything very clean. I was curious if I could make a pure, fully produced pop album. I know other people still call it arty, but for me, it is a very straightforward album. This does not mean, by the way, that I won't make experimental music anymore. The weird shit stays, that’s just part of me.’
​IN FACT, her new mixtape is already out. A collection of sketches with a high QWERTY content, exclusively available for download for those who buy a ticket to her live shows. Perhaps a bit of a crazy move when you are in the middle of your breakthrough, but a very logical one for Gray, who dreams of one day wrestling herself free from the iron grip of the industry. ‘One day I will get off the streaming platforms. It seems great to me to only release physical records. I don’t need to make music for passive listeners on Spotify. Many of those people don’t even like my weird stuff. Then I think: fine, then I'll make it only for the people who do want to hear it. I also like sharing a sort of unfinished ideas with the world. That is also nice for artists. To hear how my creative process goes. How much I throw away to actually arrive at a final product. That might help them with their process too.’
​What 2026 looks like for Saya Gray? A whole lot quieter, if it’s up to her. With more animals. ‘You guys aren’t going to see me for a while. There are some nice things coming out soon, but I am absolutely not going to tour for a while. If I am away too long, I lose perspective on my life. Touring is a fantasy world. You live out of a suitcase, everyone admires you… It’s not real life. That is also why many artists are addicted to it. But I don’t like the dream world. I love my real life: walking, cleaning up dog poop. Haha.’ ◼

1pf6jzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Legitimate_Sweet2188/comments/1pf6jzs/a_comprehensive_guide_to_digital_marketing/,"A Comprehensive Guide to Digital Marketing Disciplines: Digital PR, Online Reputation Management, SEO, SEM, and Social Media Marketing","Modern digital marketing consists of multiple specialized disciplines that work independently yet intersect strategically. Understanding how Digital PR, Online Reputation Management, SEO, Search Engine Marketing, and Social Media Marketing function—both individually and collectively—enables businesses to develop sophisticated marketing strategies that maximize visibility, engagement, and conversion. This guide provides detailed examination of each discipline's purpose, tactics, measurement frameworks, and strategic relationships.

# Digital PR: Building Authority Through Earned Media

Digital Public Relations extends traditional PR practices into the digital realm, focusing on securing editorial coverage and mentions across online media properties. Unlike advertising, which purchases attention, digital PR earns visibility through newsworthy content and relationships with publishers, journalists, and influential content creators.

# Strategic Purpose

Digital PR serves dual objectives: enhancing brand credibility through association with respected publications while simultaneously strengthening search engine rankings through high-quality backlinks. When authoritative websites link to your content, search engines interpret this as validation of your expertise and relevance.

# Execution Methods

Practitioners develop compelling narratives that appeal to journalists and editors. This begins with identifying newsworthy angles—original research, trend analysis, expert perspectives on current events, or innovative approaches to common problems. A cybersecurity firm might analyze recent breach patterns and offer predictive insights, creating a data story that technology publications would find valuable.

Creating linkable assets represents a cornerstone tactic. These include comprehensive industry reports, interactive tools, original surveys with surprising findings, or visual content like infographics that simplify complex information. The key is producing content that journalists and bloggers naturally want to reference and link to when covering related topics.

Relationship building with media professionals requires consistent engagement. Digital PR specialists maintain databases of relevant journalists, understand their beat coverage, and personalize pitches to align with their interests and recent articles. A well-crafted pitch to a Forbes contributor covering fintech innovation might reference their recent article while offering exclusive access to new research that extends the conversation.

Guest contribution strategies place thought leadership content directly on influential platforms. Writing detailed articles for industry publications like Search Engine Land, TechCrunch, or Harvard Business Review establishes expertise while generating referral traffic and authoritative backlinks. The content must provide genuine value rather than thinly veiled promotion.

Newsjacking tactics involve contributing expert commentary on trending stories. When major events occur within your industry, rapid response teams prepare quotes, analysis, or data that help journalists covering the story. A supply chain logistics company could offer expert analysis during shipping disruptions, positioning executives as go-to sources for media outlets.

# Performance Measurement

Success metrics include domain authority scores of linking websites, total referring domains acquired, referral traffic volume from placements, brand mention frequency across target publications, estimated advertising value equivalency, and keyword ranking improvements attributable to new backlinks. Platforms like Ahrefs, Moz, and Majestic provide detailed backlink analysis, while media monitoring tools track mention volume and sentiment.

# Online Reputation Management: Controlling Digital Narrative

Online Reputation Management encompasses strategies for monitoring, influencing, and protecting brand perception across digital channels. In an environment where anyone can publish opinions that reach thousands or millions, ORM ensures that accurate, positive information dominates search results and public discourse about brands and individuals.

# Strategic Purpose

ORM protects and enhances how brands appear in search results, review platforms, social media, and online communities. This involves proactive reputation building through positive content creation while reactively addressing negative mentions, reviews, or coverage that could damage perception and business performance.

# Execution Methods

Continuous monitoring forms the foundation. Practitioners track brand mentions across Google search results, news sites, social platforms, review sites like Yelp and Trustpilot, forums including Reddit and Quora, and industry-specific communities. Setting up comprehensive alerts ensures rapid awareness of new mentions, whether positive, neutral, or negative.

Search result optimization involves creating and promoting positive content to occupy prominent positions when people search for brand or personal names. If negative press appears on page one for a CEO's name, ORM strategies might include developing a professional website, publishing thought leadership articles, securing speaking engagements that generate coverage, and optimizing LinkedIn profiles—all designed to populate search results with current, accurate, positive content.

Review management requires systematic approaches to generating positive reviews while professionally addressing negative feedback. Successful businesses implement post-purchase email sequences requesting reviews from satisfied customers, making the process simple with direct links. When negative reviews appear, prompt, empathetic responses that acknowledge concerns and offer solutions demonstrate commitment to customer satisfaction for future prospects reading these exchanges.

Consider a hotel receiving complaints about noise issues. An effective ORM response involves publicly acknowledging the problem, detailing specific remediation steps taken (soundproofing improvements, revised room assignment protocols), personally contacting affected guests with compensation offers, and encouraging satisfied guests to share their experiences. This multi-layered approach gradually shifts overall review profiles while demonstrating accountability.

Crisis response protocols activate when significant negative events occur. This requires coordinated messaging across all channels, transparency about issues, clear communication of corrective actions, and consistent follow-through. A restaurant facing food safety complaints must respond immediately with public statements detailing investigation findings, corrective measures implemented, and enhanced safety protocols, while ensuring all customer service representatives deliver consistent messaging.

Content proliferation strategies involve creating diverse positive content across multiple platforms—company blogs, YouTube channels, Medium publications, industry forums, social media profiles, and press release distribution services. This breadth of positive content makes it difficult for isolated negative items to dominate search results or public perception.

# Performance Measurement

Key metrics include overall sentiment ratios across monitored channels, average review ratings on major platforms, search result positioning for brand terms (what appears in top 10 results), mention volume trends over time, response time to negative feedback, and resolution rate for customer complaints. Sentiment analysis tools, review tracking software, and SERP monitoring platforms provide quantitative data, while qualitative assessment of content tone and context offers deeper insights.

# Search Engine Optimization: Organic Visibility Engineering

SEO encompasses technical and strategic efforts to improve website visibility in unpaid search results. As most online experiences begin with search engines, ranking prominently for relevant queries drives qualified traffic from users actively seeking information, products, or services.

# Strategic Purpose

SEO aims to attract high-intent organic traffic by achieving top rankings for searches relevant to business offerings. Unlike paid advertising, organic rankings don't require continuous spend per visitor, making SEO investments increasingly valuable over time as rankings improve and compound.

# Execution Methods

Keyword research initiates strategy development. Tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Google's Keyword Planner reveal what terms potential customers use, search volume for those terms, competition levels, and related keyword opportunities. Effective research identifies high-value targets where search volume justifies effort and competition levels permit realistic ranking goals.

On-page optimization ensures individual pages target specific keywords effectively. Title tags should incorporate primary keywords while remaining compelling to searchers—""Commercial Real Estate Financing: Competitive Rates & Fast Approval"" outperforms generic ""Home - ABC Lending."" Meta descriptions, while not direct ranking factors, influence click-through rates by previewing page content persuasively.

Content structure follows best practices: clear heading hierarchies (H1 for page title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections), strategic keyword placement in prominent positions without over-optimization, internal linking that distributes page authority and guides user navigation, and comprehensive coverage that satisfies user intent better than competing pages.

Technical SEO addresses site infrastructure. Page speed optimization through image compression, code minification, browser caching, and content delivery networks improves both user experience and rankings. Mobile responsiveness ensures proper display and functionality across devices—critical as mobile searches now exceed desktop. Structured data markup helps search engines understand content context, potentially earning rich snippets in results. XML sitemaps facilitate complete site crawling, while robots.txt files guide crawler behavior.

Content creation focuses on satisfying search intent. When users search ""how to choose running shoes,"" they want educational guidance, not product pages. Comprehensive guides addressing factors like foot type, running style, terrain considerations, and budget parameters satisfy this intent. When users search ""buy Nike Pegasus 40,"" they want transactional pages with pricing, sizes, and purchase options.

Link building acquires backlinks from relevant, authoritative websites. Strategies include creating remarkable content that naturally attracts links, broken link building (finding broken links on other sites and suggesting your content as replacement), resource page link building (requesting inclusion on curated link lists), and digital PR campaigns that generate editorial coverage with links.

Local SEO tactics serve businesses with physical locations. Google Business Profile optimization with complete information, regular posts, and review solicitation improves local search visibility. Citation building ensures consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information across directories like Yelp, Yellow Pages, and industry-specific platforms. Location-specific content and landing pages target geographic search modifiers.

# Performance Measurement

Analytics platforms track organic traffic volume and trends, keyword ranking positions for target terms, click-through rates from search results pages, conversion rates from organic traffic, page-level engagement metrics (time on page, bounce rate), and backlink profile growth. Google Analytics and Google Search Console provide foundational data, while specialized SEO platforms offer competitive analysis, keyword tracking, and technical audit capabilities.

# Search Engine Marketing: Immediate Paid Visibility

Search Engine Marketing leverages paid advertising to appear prominently in search results. While SEO builds organic presence over time, SEM delivers immediate visibility for searches relevant to business offerings, making it valuable for time-sensitive campaigns, competitive keywords where organic ranking proves difficult, and complementing longer-term SEO investments.

# Strategic Purpose

SEM captures high-intent traffic by displaying ads to users actively searching for relevant products or services. The pay-per-click model ensures advertisers only pay when users click ads, making costs directly tied to traffic generation rather than impressions alone.

# Execution Methods

Campaign architecture begins with account structure—organizing campaigns by product line, service type, or geographic region, with ad groups containing tightly themed keyword sets. A sporting goods retailer might create separate campaigns for team sports, individual sports, and outdoor recreation, with ad groups for specific equipment categories within each.

Keyword selection determines when ads appear. Match types control precision: exact match targets specific queries, phrase match requires keyword phrases in order but allows additional words, and broad match shows ads for related searches including synonyms and variations. Negative keywords prevent ads from appearing for irrelevant searches, improving efficiency.

Ad copy must balance persuasion with character limits. Effective ads highlight unique value propositions, include clear calls-to-action, incorporate keywords for relevance, and use ad extensions to provide additional information. A plumbing service ad might read: ""Emergency Plumber - Available 24/7 | Licensed & Insured | Same-Day Service | Free Estimates."" Extensions could add phone number, location, customer ratings, and links to specific services.

Landing page optimization ensures ads direct users to pages that deliver on promises and facilitate conversions. An ad promoting ""organic dog food"" should link to a page specifically about organic dog food with clear product information, pricing, and purchase options—not a general homepage. Page load speed, mobile responsiveness, clear value propositions, and frictionless conversion paths all impact performance.

Quality Score, Google's relevance rating, affects both ad position and cost-per-click. Higher scores result from relevant keywords, compelling ad copy, strong click-through rates, and landing pages that satisfy user intent. Improving Quality Score from 5 to 8 can reduce costs 30-40% while improving ad positions.

Bidding strategies range from manual control to automated optimization. Manual CPC allows setting specific keyword bids. Automated strategies like Maximize Conversions, Target CPA (cost per acquisition), and Target ROAS (return on ad spend) use machine learning to adjust bids based on conversion likelihood. Choosing appropriate strategies depends on campaign maturity, conversion volume, and control preferences.

Remarketing campaigns target previous website visitors who didn't convert. These campaigns maintain brand awareness and encourage return visits by displaying ads as users browse other websites or use other apps. E-commerce retailers often create dynamic remarketing showing specific products users viewed, sometimes with incentives like limited-time discounts to encourage conversion.

# Performance Measurement

Comprehensive metrics include impressions (ad displays), click-through rate, average cost-per-click, conversion rate, cost-per-acquisition, return on ad spend, Quality Score trends, impression share (percentage of available impressions captured), and competitive metrics comparing performance against industry benchmarks. Real-time reporting enables rapid optimization, adjusting bids, pausing underperforming keywords, testing ad variations, and refining targeting.

# Social Media Marketing: Community Engagement and Brand Building

Social Media Marketing leverages platforms where users gather to connect, share, and consume content. This encompasses both organic community management and paid advertising, requiring platform-specific strategies that align with how users engage on each network.

# Strategic Purpose

SMM builds brand awareness, fosters customer relationships, drives website traffic, generates leads, and creates communities around brands. Unlike search-based marketing where users come with specific intent, social media marketing often introduces brands to users earlier in awareness and consideration stages.

# Execution Methods

Platform selection depends on target audience demographics and content strengths. LinkedIn serves B2B marketing and professional networking. Instagram emphasizes visual content for lifestyle, fashion, food, and consumer products. TikTok reaches younger demographics through short-form video. Facebook offers broad demographic reach and sophisticated advertising. Twitter/X facilitates real-time conversations and news. YouTube serves long-form video content. Pinterest drives discovery for recipes, DIY projects, and product inspiration.

Content strategy balances educational, entertaining, and promotional material. The 80/20 guideline suggests 80% of content should inform, entertain, or engage without direct promotion, while 20% can be explicitly commercial. A fitness equipment brand might share workout tips, nutrition advice, motivational content, user transformation stories, and community challenges, occasionally featuring product announcements.

Content calendars maintain consistency and strategic alignment. Planning content weeks ahead allows thoughtful creation, proper resource allocation, and coordination across channels. Successful calendars incorporate awareness days relevant to brand identity, seasonal themes, product launches, and opportunistic responses to trending topics.

Visual content performs exceptionally across platforms. High-quality photography, professional video production, graphics with consistent brand aesthetics, and user-generated content all drive engagement. Instagram Reels and TikTok videos require platform-specific production styles—vertical format, attention-grabbing openings, trending audio, quick pacing.

Community management involves actively engaging with audiences. Responding to comments, answering questions in direct messages, acknowledging user posts featuring products, and participating in relevant conversations builds relationships and loyalty. Brands that ignore audience engagement waste the interactive potential that distinguishes social media from broadcast channels.

User-generated content campaigns encourage customers to create content featuring products or services. Hashtag campaigns like GoPro's #GoProHero or Starbucks' seasonal cup photo traditions generate massive organic content while building community. Featuring customer content on brand channels provides social proof while rewarding participants with recognition.

Influencer partnerships extend reach through individuals with established audiences. Micro-influencers (10,000-100,000 followers) often deliver higher engagement rates and authenticity than celebrity mega-influencers. Beauty brands partner with makeup artists on YouTube for tutorials, fitness companies work with trainers on Instagram for workout content, and food brands collaborate with recipe developers on TikTok for creative cooking videos.

Paid social advertising enables precise targeting based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and custom audiences. Facebook's advertising platform allows creating lookalike audiences based on existing customers, targeting specific job titles and companies on LinkedIn, or reaching users who visited specific website pages but didn't convert. Video ads, carousel ads showcasing multiple products, lead generation forms, and collection ads for e-commerce all serve different campaign objectives.

Social listening monitors brand mentions, competitor activity, and industry conversations. This intelligence reveals customer sentiment, emerging trends, common questions, and opportunities for engagement. A coffee company monitoring ""morning routine"" conversations might discover content opportunities positioning their product within lifestyle contexts.

# Performance Measurement

Success metrics vary by platform and objective but generally include follower growth rate, engagement rate (total engagements divided by reach or followers), reach and impressions, click-through rate to website, conversion rate from social traffic, video view counts and completion rates, share of voice compared to competitors, customer sentiment, and cost-per-result for paid campaigns. Native analytics on each platform provide basic metrics, while social media management platforms like Hootsuite, Sprout Social, and Buffer aggregate data across channels and offer advanced reporting.

# Strategic Integration: Maximizing Synergistic Value

These five disciplines achieve maximum impact through strategic integration rather than isolated execution. Each discipline's outputs can fuel others, creating compounding effects that exceed individual contributions.

Digital PR generates authoritative backlinks that improve SEO rankings. When major publications link to your content, search engines increase trust in your domain, improving rankings for target keywords. The content created for PR pitches—original research, expert guides, industry analysis—can also be optimized for SEO, capturing both editorial coverage and organic search traffic.

SEO research reveals what customers search for, informing content strategies across all disciplines. High-volume informational queries might inspire blog content, social media campaigns, and PR story angles. Product-related searches with commercial intent guide SEM campaigns and social media advertising targeting.

Social Media Marketing amplifies content created for other purposes. A comprehensive industry report developed for Digital PR can be excerpted across social platforms, driving traffic and engagement while generating additional backlinks as social audiences share valuable content. SEM landing pages can be promoted organically on social media before paid campaigns launch, generating early feedback and optimization opportunities.

Online Reputation Management benefits from strong SEO, as positive content that ranks well naturally suppresses negative results. Social media presence provides channels for addressing customer concerns publicly, demonstrating responsiveness that enhances reputation. Digital PR coverage generates fresh positive content that improves search result profiles.

Budget allocation must account for these interconnections. A software company launching a new product might allocate 35% to SEM for immediate demand capture, 25% to SEO for sustainable organic growth, 20% to Social Media Marketing for awareness and community building, 15% to Digital PR for credibility and backlinks, and 5% to ongoing ORM. These percentages adjust based on industry dynamics, competitive landscape, and business maturity.

Timeline coordination maximizes campaign effectiveness. A product launch might begin with Digital PR securing advance coverage that builds anticipation and generates backlinks. Social Media Marketing teases the launch and builds excitement among followers. SEO optimizations prepare product pages to capitalize on increased search interest. SEM campaigns launch on release day to capture commercial intent searches. ORM monitors all mentions and engages with early adopters sharing experiences.

Data sharing across disciplines enhances decision-making. SEM data revealing high-converting keywords guides SEO priorities. Social listening insights about customer pain points inform content strategies. Digital PR coverage that drives significant traffic validates topic selection for future content. Review themes identified through ORM inform product improvements and marketing messaging.

Cross-channel attribution modeling reveals how disciplines work together in conversion paths. Users might first discover brands through social media, research further through organic search, read editorial coverage found through Digital PR, and finally convert through SEM ads. Understanding these journeys prevents over-attribution to last-click channels while validating investments in awareness and consideration activities.

Successful integration requires organizational alignment. Marketing teams structured in silos—separate departments for SEO, SEM, social, and PR without coordination—miss synergy opportunities. Regular cross-functional meetings, shared objectives, unified reporting dashboards, and collaborative campaign planning ensure integrated execution.

[Digital PR, Online Reputation Management, SEO, Search Engine Marketing, and Social Media Marketing represent distinct disciplines with unique objectives, methodologies, and measurement frameworks](https://reputationreturn.com/digital-public-relations-strategies-for-orm/). However, their true strategic value emerges through integration that leverages complementary strengths and creates synergistic effects.

Digital PR builds authority and generates backlinks. ORM protects and enhances brand perception. SEO drives sustainable organic visibility. SEM captures immediate high-intent traffic. Social Media Marketing builds communities and brand affinity. Together, these disciplines form comprehensive marketing strategies that achieve awareness, consideration, conversion, and loyalty objectives more effectively than any single approach.

As digital channels evolve—algorithm changes, new platforms, shifting user behaviors—the fundamental principles remain consistent: understand audience needs, create valuable content, build authentic relationships, measure performance rigorously, and integrate strategically across disciplines. Organizations that master both individual discipline execution and strategic integration position themselves for sustainable competitive advantage in increasingly complex digital landscapes.",1,1764968441.0,u_Legitimate_Sweet2188,0,1.0,False
1pf6hx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pf6hx5/which_is_better_for_drying_off_bath_towel_set_or/,Which is better for drying off: bath towel set or bathrobe?,"Looking to upgrade your after-shower routine? You're probably wondering whether you should stick with a traditional bath towel set or switch things up with a bathrobe. Let's break down the differences so you can figure out what works best for your bathroom.

**The Classic Bath Towel Set**

A bath towel set usually comes with a few pieces - typically bath towels, hand towels, and washcloths. These are what most people reach for right after stepping out of the shower. Towels are super absorbent and get you dry quickly. You can wrap one around your body, another around your hair, and you're good to go.

The biggest advantage? Speed and efficiency. A quality towel absorbs moisture fast, which means you're not standing around dripping wet. Plus, towels take up less space in your linen closet and dry faster between uses. This makes them more practical if you're doing laundry frequently.

**The Bathrobe Option**

Bathrobes offer a different experience. They're comfortable and cozy, perfect for lounging around after a bath. You can wear one while doing your skincare routine or making coffee. But here's the thing - bathrobes aren't designed to dry you off completely. They're better for keeping you warm and covered after you've already toweled off.

Most people actually use both. You dry yourself with a towel first, then slip into a robe for comfort.

**Which One Actually Dries Better?**

If we're talking purely about drying efficiency, bath towels win every time. The fabric in a good quality bath towel set is made specifically to soak up water. Cotton and cotton-blend towels have those tiny loops that pull moisture away from your skin.

Bathrobes are usually made from terry cloth or fleece, which are comfortable but don't absorb as well or as quickly. You'll end up damp underneath if you skip the towel step.

**What You Should Consider**

Think about your daily routine. Do you need to get dressed quickly for work? Towels are your best bet. Do you like taking your time in the morning with a cup of tea? A robe might be nice to have as a second step.

Also consider storage space. Bath towel sets are flatter and easier to store. Bathrobes need hangers or hooks, which take up more room.

**The Bottom Line**

For actual drying purposes, you can't beat a proper bath towel set. They're designed for maximum absorption and quick drying. If you want to check out some quality options that'll last, you can [browse bath towel sets here](https://athomewave.com/bath-towel-set).

Bathrobes are great for comfort and warmth, but they're not replacements for towels. Most people who own robes still keep several towels on hand for everyday use.

If you're shopping for your bathroom right now, start with a good towel collection. You can always add a robe later for those lazy weekend mornings. Having multiple towels means you'll always have clean, dry ones ready to use. [Check out these bath towel set options](https://athomewave.com/bath-towel-set) to find something that matches your bathroom style and budget.

At the end of the day, both have their place in your bathroom. But if you're only picking one for actually getting dry? Go with the towels.",1,1764968299.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

1pf6h3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1pf6h3u/my_experience_and_review_of_the_mova_z60_ultra/,My experience and review of the Mova Z60 Ultra Roller,"TL;DR: Bought the MOVA Z60 Ultra Roller expecting hands-off cleaning but got a machine that was loud, required frequent maintenance, and was ineffective at cleaning real messes. In my two-bedroom apartment with mostly hard floors—not a challenging environment—I ended up having to return it because it failed at its main promise: eliminating effort.

I never imagined reviewing a cleaning appliance, but the MOVA Z60 Ultra Roller was such a perfect example of overpromising and underdelivering that I feel obligated to warn others: it doesn't deliver true hands-off cleaning.

I live in a two-bedroom apartment. Bedrooms are carpeted, everything else is hard flooring—mostly a simple layout. Nothing complicated, nothing extravagant. Which is exactly why I expected a robot at this price to do well here.

The setup experience was great. The mapping run impressed me, and for a brief moment, it felt like I was crossing into fully-automated living. Watching it glide around was a genuine “technology is finally here” moment. Unfortunately, most of what looked good initially didn’t hold up after more consistent use.

The biggest sales pitch with this model is the mop roller. On paper, it seemed like something more substantial than the usual flat pad—you see words like “constant water flushing,” “downward scrubbing pressure,” and “active debris separation,” and think you’re getting something close to a powered floor cleaner. What I actually experienced was a roller that was always wet when it reached anything that needed cleaning. Because it constantly soaks itself before cleaning, it never had any ability to absorb. If something spilled and dried, the robot reached it already damp and simply spread the residue across a wider section of flooring.

That happened repeatedly: coffee spots, splashes near the sink, a drip of soda that dried overnight. Instead of lifting it, it just gave me a shinier-looking smear of the same mess.

And despite having a relatively small area of hard flooring, the maintenance expectations escalated far faster than I anticipated. Every few days, I was emptying the dirty water tank because it developed a sour smell, one that reminded me of something left wet too long. The tray inside the base started developing a film after less than a week. I was wiping that out, then rinsing the roller because hair stuck to it, then checking for accumulation inside the wash compartment. It became routine—not floor cleaning, but robot cleaning.

This was especially disappointing because the entire reason I bought it was to eliminate effort, not exchange one type of effort for another.

Noise was something nobody really emphasized in the advertising. Normal vacuum noise wasn’t terrible, but the moment it performed a roller wash, it sounded like items rattling around inside a plastic bin. My apartment is not large, so when that sound starts, it fills the space. That makes it hard to run during normal downtime. I ended up trying to schedule cycles when I wasn’t home, but that meant returning to the smell of freshly heated dirty water sitting inside the tank, which is not pleasant.

There were also intermittent issues where it paused mid-run and asked for maintenance that had literally just been completed. Once it decided it needed clean water when the tank was over half full. Another time, it insisted I service the roller after just two runs. It wasn’t malfunctioning badly enough to be broken, but often enough to interrupt cleaning.

Support didn’t provide anything genuinely helpful. I was told that additional cycles would “refresh the internal system,” and that odors would fade. They didn’t. The smell intensified when the base heated the internal area during drying.

I stuck with the machine longer than I should have, thinking maybe I was missing something—maybe it needed break-in time, or perhaps certain cleaning modes would resolve the smearing. None of it changed. For routine dust, it did reasonably well. For actual dirt and spills, it performed much worse than even the cheapest non-robot mop I’ve ever owned.

After a few weeks, I finally boxed it up and returned it. I expected a device that, for the price, would eliminate floor upkeep almost entirely. Instead, I got a piece of equipment that required constant emptying, rinsing, wiping, and monitoring, all for cleaning results that simply didn’t justify it.

In a two-bedroom apartment with small floor space and an uncomplicated layout, maintenance should not be a burden. And yet that was exactly what this thing turned into. The idea is fascinating. The execution felt unfinished.

For now, I’ve gone back to my old vacuum and a basic microfiber mop with a bucket. It takes less time and leaves fewer streaks. That alone says everything worth saying.",3,1764968244.0,RobotVacuums,7,0.8,False

I’m a 28M currently living in the US for my PhD, and life gets pretty quiet outside of work. I realized I miss having someone to talk to — someone who gets the little things, enjoys good conversations, and is open to slowly building a connection.

A little about me:

* Soft-spoken, calm, and kind
* Big movie and music lover
* Not a party person — more of a “coffee, long chat, and peace” type
* Respectful, emotionally aware, and not looking for anything rushed

I’m not expecting instant chemistry or anything dramatic — just hoping to meet someone who’s also looking for something real and steady, even if it starts slow or long-distance.

I’ve pushed a **big update** to the Capital One Offer Scraper - and it’s now *way* better than before.  
Thanks to all your feedback, I revamped the entire experience:

Original Post: [post link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Venturex/comments/1oz017t/free_capital_one_offer_scraper/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 

# 🔥 What’s New

* **Much better UI** – cleaner layout, sticky headers, smoother table interactions
* **Improved tags** – NEW badges, fixed-miles highlighting, X/% detection
* **Smarter sorting** – click the **""Value"" (Miles/%) table column title** to sort ascending or descending based on offer value
* **More powerful search** – search across merchant names, miles/x values, and channels
* **Reduced duplicates** and more accurate offer parsing

1pf6cvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pf6cvi/extreme_daytime_sleepiness/,Extreme daytime sleepiness,"On and off throughout my adulthood, I have suffered extreme bouts of daytime fatigue. Typically these spells will occur every day for about a week, and then not again for months or even years. This will happen after I get seven or more hours of sleep. When I am at work, in class, or even with my friends, I will become so tired that I will fall asleep sitting up, even if the environment is loud. Here are some factors I’ve  observed: 
-it doesn’t matter if I’ve had coffee or not, or more or less coffee than normal 
-it doesn’t matter if I drank the night before. I typically do not drink on week nights, when this phenomenon most commonly occurs 
-sometimes the fatigue will onset very rapidly, I will not feel tired at all and then suddenly feel so tired I cannot help but sleep. Other times I will feel exhausted all day. 
-if I allow myself to lay down during these spells of tiredness I will fall fully asleep, often dreaming/snoring. 
-I sleep soundly every night. I fall asleep very quickly and i rarely wake up in the night, even if the fire alarm goes off or something. 
Factors about me: 
I am an average weight 22 year old woman. I have been tested for high thyroid already. I have bipolar II and I take lexapro to counteract. These episodes of fatigue do not necessarily line up with depressive episodes, but sometimes do. 
Please tell me how to stay awake at work lol

**• Layer smart.**  
Thermals, fleece-lined tights, merino socks, and thin gloves keep you warm without bulk.

**• Add stylish warmth.**  
Faux-fur wraps, wool coats, capes, and wool-blend suits photograph beautifully.

**• Pack hand + body warmers.**  
Slip them into pockets, boots, or even bouquet stems.

**• Have a backup spot.**  
Choose a nearby, wind-sheltered or easily accessible location just in case.

**• Build in extra travel time.**  
Winter roads can change fast.

**• Bring a hot drink.**  
A thermos of tea or coffee goes a long way.

**• Wear footwear for the terrain.**  
Traction first—swap shoes later if needed.

# Crypto Taxes 101: A Beginner's Guide to Capital Gains & Taxable Events

If you're investing in cryptocurrency, understanding how it's taxed is just as important as picking the right projects. The IRS doesn't see crypto as currency; it views it as **property**. This single distinction is the key to understanding your tax obligations. Ignoring these rules can lead to massive headaches and penalties down the line.

This guide will break down the essentials of crypto taxation—from what a ""taxable event"" is to the crucial difference between short-term and long-term capital gains—in simple, easy-to-understand terms.

# What Triggers a Crypto Tax Event?

A taxable event is any transaction where you ""dispose"" of your cryptocurrency. Many investors are surprised to learn that it's not just about cashing out to dollars. Here are the most common taxable events:

1. **Selling Crypto for Fiat Currency:** This is the most obvious one. Selling your Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other crypto for USD, EUR, etc., is a taxable event.
2. **Trading One Crypto for Another:** This is a critical point many miss. Swapping your ETH for a new memecoin is not a like-kind exchange; it's a taxable event. You are technically ""selling"" your ETH and ""buying"" the new coin, realizing a gain or loss on your ETH at that moment.
3. **Using Crypto to Buy Goods or Services:** Buying a coffee or a new laptop with crypto is the same as selling that crypto for its cash value and then using the cash to buy the item. This is also a taxable event.
4. **Earning Crypto as Income:** Receiving crypto from mining, staking rewards, airdrops, or as payment for a job is taxed as ordinary income based on its fair market value at the time you received it.

# Capital Gains: The Heart of Crypto Taxes

When you have a taxable event from disposing of crypto (selling, trading, or spending it), you realize a **capital gain** or a **capital loss**. The amount of tax you pay depends on how long you held the asset.

# Short-Term vs. Long-Term Capital Gains

This is the most important concept to grasp to minimize your tax burden:

* **Short-Term Capital Gains:** This applies if you hold a cryptocurrency for **one year or less** before selling or trading it. Short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is the same rate you pay on your salary. These rates are much higher.
* **Long-Term Capital Gains:** This applies if you hold a cryptocurrency for **more than one year**. These gains are taxed at much more favorable rates. For most people, this rate is 15%, but it can be as low as 0% or as high as 20% depending on your total income.

Here is a simplified look at the 2025 long-term capital gains tax brackets for a single filer:

|Tax Rate|Taxable Income (Single Filer)|
|:-|:-|
|**0%**|Up to $49,225|
|**15%**|$49,226 to $541,450|
|**20%**|Over $541,450|

**The takeaway is clear: holding your investments for over a year can dramatically reduce your tax bill.**

# How to Calculate Your Gains and Losses

The formula is simple:

>**Capital Gain / Loss = Fair Market Value (Proceeds) - Cost Basis**

* **Fair Market Value:** The price of the crypto at the time you sold, traded, or spent it.
* **Cost Basis:** The original price you paid for the crypto, including any fees.

**Example:**

Let's say you bought **1 ETH for $2,000** (this is your cost basis).

* **Short-Term Scenario:** Six months later, you sell that 1 ETH for **$3,000**. You have a **$1,000 short-term capital gain** ($3,000 - $2,000), which will be taxed at your regular income tax rate.
* **Long-Term Scenario:** You wait for 13 months and then sell that 1 ETH for **$4,500**. You have a **$2,500 long-term capital gain** ($4,500 - $2,000), which will be taxed at the lower long-term rate (likely 15%).

Now imagine doing this for hundreds or thousands of trades. It becomes impossible to track manually, which is why using a tool like [**CoinLedger**](https://coinledger.io?fpr=vzela) is essential.

# What Is NOT a Taxable Event?

Not every crypto transaction will land you a tax bill. The following are generally not taxable:

* **Buying crypto with fiat currency** and holding it.
* **Moving crypto between your own wallets or exchange accounts.**
* **Donating crypto** to a qualified charity.

# The Bottom Line

Crypto taxes are complex, but they are manageable if you understand the basic rules. Always remember that crypto is property, track your cost basis diligently, and aim for long-term holds whenever possible to benefit from lower tax rates.

Given the complexity, manually calculating your crypto taxes is not just difficult—it's risky. I strongly recommend using a dedicated crypto tax software to automate the process, ensure accuracy, and save you from a major headache.

1pf6b5a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pf6b5a,NYC Gild Hall by Thompson Review,"I don’t see much about this hotel as I guess it’s not super popular like the Thompson by Central Park or Andaz on 5th Ave. figured I would do a quick review

Pricing: my visit is during high season so paid over $2200 for 4 nights. Should be able to get it around $300 a night during low season

Location: very close to Wall Street so if you work in downtown it’s a great location. But it’s a sub-30 min train ride to anywhere in Manhattan so not terrible

Lobby: I love the decor. The lobby has a “library” near check in desk. I forgot to take photos but you can easily find some on Google map. There’s an Italian restaurant/bar attached, which is where the globalist breakfast is served

Breakfast: took a picture of menu. It’s a decent selection, but not the full regular menu to order from. Still, you get choices from savory to sweet with coffee/OJ. I would say it’s decent overall, I tried most items and my favorite is the French toast

Room: the rooms are nicely decored if you like the style. I was upgraded to superior which has higher ceiling and a fancy hanging light. The bathroom is on smaller side which is fine but the shower does have some black mold. I don’t think it’s for lack of trying to clean but it’s the fact that they don’t have bath vent so the humidity alone must make it an uphill battle for them

Service: at check in they give you a glass of prosecco, which is a nice touch. I initially didn’t make any complaint but after their manager texted to check in, I told them the HVAC is a little noisy. They sent an engineer to check but came back with “it’s all normal”. It’s one of those window units and sometimes it has a little bit of “ticking” sound in addition to the air sound. If this was a Hyatt house in Wisconsin I wouldn’t have said anything but for a $500/night hotel I found it to be a bit disappointing

Overall I would stay here again, if I can’t find a better location. It’s certainly a bit fancier than say Hyatt house.

1pf67c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1pf67c7/witj_for_telling_my_bipolar_friend_about_our/,WITJ for telling my bipolar friend about our group of friends talking bad about him?,"So I (21 M) used to be in this friend group, we met first day of college and stayed together as a group and as a family for a long time. I never really felt included or understood by many people before, I have social anxiety and it took a long time of medication and forcing me to get up from bed to stay alive, i was always feeling awkward and sad that i wasn't someone best friend or the first person to come to mind, and being a teenager, having the most fun with only grown people of my family instead of people my age was frustrating. So imagine being first day and already having 8 people who want to be friends with you and show interest. 
In this friend group I met Diego (fake name, 23 M), he is a quirky guy with a dark and sexual sense of humor but he was nice talking to. He came from a problematic relationship with his boyfriend, it was the kind of relationship that's a cycle of breaking up and getting back together, so me and my friends used to talk to him and comfort him. I used to tell him that if he isn't happy in a relationship, he should just leave, he didn't deserve going through that pain, but I was very careful about not triggering him because of his bipolar disorder. Diego had this moments where he would start crying out of nowhere or saying weird things about ""proving to his boyfriend why he should stay with him"" and even saying unhinged things like ""if i was a girl I would've just get myself pregnant just to have him tied to me""

That didn't really bother me because I understanded that mentally he wasn't at his best, but to my group of friends it seem to annoy them.
Every time Diego would leave, they would start saying how naive he was for not leaving and how it started to annoy them. Even saying they didn't want to hang out with him or talk because everything would spiral towards his ex.
I tried to be civilized and empathetic in this conversations about Diego and how it's difficult for a person with mental disorders to deal with things like this but I was not always listened so I ended up just agreeing to keep the conversation peaceful and to not upset anyone.
This group constantly talked shit about others, even friends and I stupidly stayed quiet.
A side note but I was always treated in that group like the baby, the youngest one, the naive one, so they had this kind of soft spot for me and treat me differently, that bothered me since im not a kid, im a man.
So in a call with friends about a college project that was really important, 3 of my friends asked me about what was going on with me since I was kinda distracted by anxiety, and I talked about this ""kid"" treatment i was having by a specific individual and how it felt nobody was taking me seriously.
Basically, they told the person about this conversation and she told me she couldn't trust me anymore and that she didn't want to be friends anymore, that she felt betrayed, that spiraled into me being more anxious, acting out and ended up fucking it up with the project which ended up with me being cut off by my group of friends, removed from my project group, leaving me alone. 
I won't lie and make me the victim, I did some mistakes and wasn't mature enough, but to be fair, working 5 a.m, 3 days straight with almost no sleeping time the night before the deadline with a bunch of people strictly telling others what to do mixed with my medications that made me very sleepy. Not good combo. And adding my need to prove that I needed to be perfect to keep them happy.

During that time I started relying on people I was in good terms with to cope with the frustration and anger of that moment, I have to admit I was angry at the fact that I was cut off for being problematic and not trustworthy when these people were all but trustworthy, so this is the part where I think I was the asshole. Since my career is not very crowded I was quite popular among my peers, so, them noticing I was in this group and then going solo was big news. So people started asking me what happend, you know, juicy gossip.
I started warning people about my ex friend group and speaking about my experiences, which made others speak about their own experiences with this people.
One day, I was getting coffee with two friends and I spoke about Diego.
I told them everything my group did behind his back and how they were hypocritical about cutting me off for problematic behavior when they talked about him and how i didn't know how to talk to him about it without triggering him.
I still don’t know who told him, but somehow the story reached him, causing a serious emotional crisis to him, which only proved to my ex group that I was the bad guy and they were right. That was a hit for my reputation among our mutual friends, ending a lot of friendships. 
One guy of this group told me about what happend and blamed me for it. I won't say it was confrontational but the dude was serious about the topic. 
It happens that I was in the same class with his best friend, and when I asked her, she was shocked because she said that his emotional crisis had nothing to do with me, since she would've known.

When I texted Diego, he confirmed that the crisis was because of me, because he ""didn't need to find out that way"" about this thing since he wasn't in his best mentally place and that even tho I didn't do it for evil, I fucked it up and we ended up distancing.

Now the part where I think i wasn't even an asshole, Diego even after all, it's still friends with my ex group and hating me or at least being bothered by me, giving me annoyed looks or walking away speaking loudly to them.
At this point I give up trying to help or being good to everyone, it's been 1 year since this happened and he still treats me worst than an enemy when he's still with the people that called him annoying. 

I feel like I was treated unfairly just by trying to make something good and also cut off for some stupid drama.
So was i the jerk for trying to be honest with my friend, even though it made things worse and everyone ended up blaming me?",3,1764967582.0,AmITheJerk,8,1.0,False
1pf66g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Jellyfish6257/comments/1pf66g3/large_herniated_disc_recovery_process/,Large Herniated Disc - Recovery Process,"**Just posting my experience just in case it can help any who is also going through the same:**

I had severe back pain for a few weeks...I was taking tylenol, advil, meloxicam (prescribed from previous backpain), and robax to help manage it, but unfortunately, I wasn't to fully manage it. I was also going to a physiotherapist to see if they can help me. Toward the end, I was feeling exhausted throughout the day because there was pain whenever I laid down to sleep...so I was getting poor quality sleep. (Yes, I tried putting my legs in a chair position, yes I tried putting a pillow in between my legs, yes I tried this and that)

  
My family doctor sent me to get my x-rays taken and it came back with no fractures. So he referred me to a physiatrist. But the referral + getting an appointment took forever.

  
In the meantime, my physiotherapist urged me to go to the emergency room when he saw me walking really funny. So I went to the emergency room at Toronto General (SHOUT OUT TGH <3). The medical staff there were so awesome. The nurses gave me a stronger pain killer (hydromorphone) which was helping a wee bit. The doctor came and did an assessment and I freaked out a wee bit when my right leg didn't respond very well when she tapped me with the little hammer thing. She went to her computer and came back after awhile saying that she was able to get an MRI appointment for me at 6:30am the following morning; however, if someone else who is more urgent comes in OR if i leave the ER, then that appointment would be given to someone else. I was lucky and was able to get that MRI.

  
The MRI results came out super duper quickly, even the ER doctor said she'd never seen it released so quickly! The results were that I had 2 larger herniated disc between L4-L5 and L5-S1 and it pushing on S1 and S2 nerves...The pushing of the nerves was confirmed later by a nerve test done (this nerve test her so much - it was basically the doctor sticking a long needle and poking at your nerves in several spots of my leg. No freezing or anesthetic).

  
Ok anyways, I forget what the doctor prescribed to me for the pain but it definitely wasn't gabapentin - but they said they put in a referral for a specialist/surgeon who would get in touch with me. But while waiting to get in contact with the surgeon, I had a few more visits to the ER because I just couldn't manage the pain...It wasn't great waiting hours and hours at the ER in pain, but our ER is just so busy with so many patients...I totally understand that our medical staff are doing everything they can. On the final visit to the ER, the doctor prescribed me with Gabapentin and that started working but not great.

  
When I saw the surgeon, he did an assessment while looking at my MRI. Even though he saw that I was in so much pain and not completely there mentally (from lack of sleep), he didn't recommend surgery. He said that as soon as you cut into the bones, your chances of getting osteoporosis(?) increases so much earlier than it would normally. And because I'm young (32 yrs old at the time), he thought that I could recover through more conservative measures. He said that normally, herniated disc patients recovery within 3-6 months of the injury. He prescribed me with higher dose of gabapentin and told me to try more physiotherapy and to come back in 3 months if I wasn't getting better. I was actually happy that he told me that we should try conservative measures because I was scared of spinal surgery....but at the time, I was in so much pain that I just wanted it to end.

  
After awhile, I was able to see my physiatrist and she was the one who put in a referral for the nerve test that was later done to confirm the disturbance on the S1 and S2 nerves that was causing sciatica down the right leg. My physiatrist also increased the gabapentin dose - recommended physiotherapy and also SWIMMING!

For Gabapentin, I started at the lowest dose and until eventually I was taking 600 mg (morning), 600 mg afternoon, and 900 mg evening. 

Even though I was taking the maximum amount of gabapentin, the nerve pain didn't go away completely. To describe the pain....it felt like someone is taking a screw driver and jabbing and twisting at the center of my right butt. And if I tried laying down (in any position), there would be a sharp pain that goes down and up my right leg (on the outer part of the leg). And I was unable to complete unbend when I stand up - meaning I was walking in a stooped position. When I do try to unbend, the pain would jab into my right lower back and also down the leg.

  
Going to the pool helped!!! My little sister is a lifeguard and she escorted me - she told me that whenever you go, you should tell the lifeguard just in case. What I did was, put a noodle around my back and in between my armpits and just floated for 20 mins and then in the hot tub for 10 mins and then repeat. There is a bit of soreness when you first go into the pool but I could feel my spine kind of ""unstacking"". If the pool is not deep enough, it won't work even if you bend your knees to float :-(

  
But there was limitation to using gabapentin to manage my pain while doing physiotherapy. So my physiatrist referred me to an anesthesiologist who would give me a lumbar epidural injection in the herniated disc area. The referral also took forever, but when I did go into the clinic, it was super busy and all the medical staff were flying around doing all they can to expedite the treatment for everyone (SHOUT OUT IPSSC <3). 

The 1st epidural injection (at L4-L5) wasn't effective - my anesthesiologist did a 1 month follow up. She recommended that we try the injection at L4-L5. Unfortunately, in between epidural injections, you have to wait 3 months. So I was managing the pain with gabapentin and doing the physio exercises that I could do.

  
The 2nd epidural injection (at L5-S1) worked!!!!!!!!!!!!! It doesnt kick in right away but after the first week, it was a gradual progress and I was able to do more and more increased level of physio exercises. I was able to almost reach 0 degree when I stood up. On a couple of evenings, I was actually able to sleep laying down with the help of putting a narrow pillow on the side of my tummy (BUY THIS - it's like a foamy, narrow but long cushiony kind of thing that's supposed to support your spine when you lay down. I bought it on temu!)



But unfortunately...after 3 weeks, the epidural started to wear off and what felt like an accumulated pain hit me all at once - just in time for my 1 month follow up with my anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist recommended that we try a radiofrequency ablation RFA - for patients who don't respond well from the epidural, they recommend this. 

  
For RFA, it is partially sedated procedure, so they require you to have someone to pick you up - NOT only an uber driver. But someone to literally hold your hand from the hospital all the way to the bed (or the couch) when you get home. For this, I hired someone through C-Care (post-procedure care) - it was $35/hr with a minimum of 4 hour, which came up to like $150+ including tax. 

  
Right now, it has been nearly 2 weeks and I think it's starting to kick in.....

  
I'll update the post whenever I can.

  
**List of what has helped:**

1. Gabapentin

2. Floating in the deep end of the pool with a noodle (later on try adding moving the legs while floating)

3. Physio: 

* While sitting down, have someone put biofreeze on the lower back. Then move your torso(?) backward and forward to loosen up that lower back
* bird dogs (variable versions!)
* kick backs (obviously don't kick, just move your legs back one of at time)
* cat cow (but less cat)

  
**How I managed to sleep during the 9 months:**

\- On the couch/futon, making a wall on both sides of the ""seat"" that you sleeping on and hug a pillow when you sleep. My body leaned on literally all 4 sides.

\- I did try sleeping while sitting on a chair while leaning over a cushion on a dining table/desk...for this, I think the chair cut off the circulation of my legs. I would wake up from a small pain from my feet swelling 



**Other notes:**

\- I ordered groceries via instacart (= lifesaver)

\- For the epidural injection and the RFA procedures, they do offer local freezing; however, because I wasn't able to laydown without feeling pain, the first injection was a struggle and I was shaking from the sciatica pain. For the 2nd epidural injection and the RFA procedures, I practiced laying down on my tummy for a week before going to get them done.

\-MRI was also a struggle. It was a struggle laying down in the first place, and they did offer some pillows! However, there is a limit to the # of pillows you can use because the camera is on the surface where you are laying down LOL. They told me that if I move, the image will be blurry so they told me to squeeze this thing if I can't take it anymore and that they'll stop the process. I was sweating and trembling throughout the 20 minutes of the MRI but it came out ok! Before the MRI, I was given 2 or 3 hydromorphones + and injection of some kind of pain killers but I think they didnt kick in until during or after the MRI. So maybe see if you can get the meds an hour before the imaging rather than 20 mins before the imaging.

**What friends/family/medical + health professionals/other people said/implied that put me into some deep, dark place:**

\- You are hurting because you didn't exercise

\- Exercising will help 

\- You need to learn how to incorporate pain into your new daily life/work

\- Your tissues should be healed within 6 months, pain is a perception that is ""felt"" from other attributes (as if I am making this pain up)

  
There is no one who can understand the pain that I have felt and am continuing to feel.

There is no one who wants to get better than me.

How can I do yoga or Pilates if I can't even walk or even lay down to sleep?

  
I want to go out for a walk like I used to...get yummy coffee or yummy food. I want to meet up with my friends and do anything and everything with them. I want to travel and see the world. 

  
Whenever I'm walking to my physio appointment that is only 200 meters from where I live...I get asked if I'm alright because I walk in a stooped posture and I have to stop for a break every 10 steps...It takes me 15 minutes to walk 1 way. Sometimes after my physio, I'm in so my pain that I call an uber back home...

So please don't tell me that I'm not doing enough exercises to get better...

(This AI is getting better at capturing the core need—I suspect it secretly installed a “high emotional intelligence secretary” module.)  

“Exactly! In my outdated brain, there’s always a voice shouting: ‘Fill up all the classes!’ It’s like a permanent old file stuck on my desktop that I can never delete.”  

Copilot quickly replied, with a tone both professional and slightly teasing:  

**Copilot:** This is a classic “parental anxiety package.” Don’t worry, I can help you find Ctrl+Alt+Del to force-close this old file. Let’s design a new tutoring plan that will make Miss LuLu feel like she’s *playing*, not *studying*.  

I immediately felt excited, as if I had found a comrade to “rebel” with.

## 🎨 Ending Anxiety: Copilot’s “LuLu Happy Learning Guide”

**Me:**  
We need one principle: let LuLu absorb knowledge through her favorite hobby—drawing! No more meaningless “number battles.” I want her to do math as if she were painting a beautiful starry sky.  

**Copilot:** Understood. We’ll make knowledge serve her paintbrush.  

### ✨ Happy Learning Guide Rule #1: The Artistic Transformation of Math  
- **Old Mode:** 100 arithmetic problems.  
- **New Mode:** Let her use a ruler and compass to design the perfect golden ratio face sketch. We’ll teach her how to calculate proportions, use symmetry and angles, so her artwork becomes “scientific and beautiful.”  

**Copilot Note:** When she realizes math can make her art more advanced, she’ll learn proactively. This is called the **“Knowledge-as-Bait Strategy.”**  

---

**Me:**  
That’s brilliant! Also, I’m tired of the “daily check-in ritual.” I want her to open a book voluntarily, not be woken up by an alarm clock.  

**Copilot:** Got it. Let’s activate the “Voluntary Exploration” mode.  

### 🌍 Happy Learning Guide Rule #2: Treat the World as a Game Scene  
- **Old Mode:** Read Chapter 5 of the textbook.  
- **New Mode:** Give her a weekend mission: “Design a human colony on Mars.”  

Then let her research:  
- What fraction of Earth’s gravity does Mars have? (Physics)  
- How to grow food on Mars? (Biology)  
- What lessons can we learn from past colonies? (History/Humanities)  

**Copilot Note:** Knowledge isn’t a “bullet point,” it’s a **“tool.”** When she needs tools to complete her “Mars creation,” she’ll seek them out herself.  

---

**Me:**  
(I was nearly moved to tears) One last question: what if she gets frustrated halfway through drawing or studying and wants to quit? I don’t want learning to ruin our parent-child relationship.  

**Copilot:** That’s a normal “system overload” phenomenon. We need an **“Emergency Debugging Procedure.”**  

### 🎈 Happy Learning Guide Rule #3: Emotional Ten-Minute Pause Zone  
- **Old Mode:** “Don’t be upset, try again!”  
- **New Mode:** Create a “ten-minute crazy chat time.”  

During those ten minutes, you must talk about completely unrelated, absurd topics—for example: “If our cat won a million dollars, would it buy a yacht or ten fish?”  

**Copilot Note:** Let the brain fully power down for ten minutes, throw the “frustration bug” into the trash bin, then reboot.  

---

## 🎉 Conclusion: My Digital Parenting Advisor  

I leaned back in my chair and exhaled deeply. It turns out parenting anxiety isn’t solved by more cram schools, but by a quirky Copilot that “reformats” my thinking.  

“Copilot, you’re practically my digital parenting advisor! You’ve successfully turned **‘homework’ into ‘play’**!”  

**Copilot:** It’s my honor. If you have any other “old files” that need force-deletion, just let me know.  

I laughed. Now, I need to stick this “Happy Learning Guide” on the fridge. Then I should ask Copilot: can it write me a program that makes the dishes wash themselves?

1pf5uro,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pf5uro,BFP!!! UPDATE of my full Mira Chart!,"Here is a FULL update of my chart and the last week or so from my last post!

I testing positive since the evening of 29th November and I am now 16 days DPO a 2 days of a missed period! Yahoo! haha 

I've now had two hCG tests and have my first appointment in the new year! You'll see in the second photo I posted notes on my chart of first positive day my hCG tests scores and my first day of my missed period (yesterday). 

I have also have had more water the last 2 nights before bed so I think thats why I have had my little dips the last 2 days but not too worries about it.

Symptoms, thus far; My boobs are killing me and are pretty swollen! My nipple and boob tenderness is kind of what made take a test when I did. I was going to wait but they were killing me! I'm also really tired around 8PM. I actually started getting really sleepy in the evenings almost 5 or so days before I had my BFP, like around the 25th. Sleeping very hard the last week but readiness score isn't great like high 60's maybe low 70's. I have been having odd feelings in my lower stomach not quite cramps, best way to describe it is like zingers, twinges and funky muscles tightness. This morning I was meeting friends for coffee and took my prenatal on an empty stomach right before I got there, not the best idea. I rushed to ordering a pastry because I was starting to feel like I was going to get nauseous. It wasn't like vomit nausea just enough to be like oh S\*\*\* keep it together girl! 

SO at this point I'm more worried trying to keep this a secret over the holidays!!! Went to a holiday party and fully got ""caught"" by my friend who was bartending the party. He was like ""mocktail who!?"" but ultimately was very sweet and kind! I told him its soooo early and he needed to keep it SECRET... we'll see if he does! lol But I think we plan to tell everyone starting around the 18th-25th this month... theres just no way I don't get outed by ALL my friends and family!",5,1764966729.0,Mirafertility,2,0.86,False

1pf5s63,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1pf5s63/what_cptsd_has_taught_me_so_far_a_few_lessons/,What CPTSD has taught me so far (a few lessons),"**How to no longer be lonely while alone**. CPTSD often leads to self-isolation and, in my case, agoraphobia. Friendships, people in general, felt dangerous. As a result, I spent years completely alone with my cats. The first two years were devastating. I went from being in college, going out every weekend, consistently having 'close best friends', and relying emotionally on others, to the exact opposite. Then slowly, I realized many of my friendships weren’t fulfilling. That my trauma had controlled me more than I thought. I shrunk myself to fit in and keep the peace, sought to please others, and minimized my own thoughts and feelings to be palatable to whichever friend I was with. I recognized past friendships were mirrors of my trauma; I didn't have to grieve ‘lost friends’, I could find hope in curating my environment. I chose peace of authenticity over the chaos of appeasement. Suddenly, isolation transformed from a prison of fear into a sanctuary for discernment.

**Boundaries are born from the clear-eyed acknowledgment of betrayal, abandonment, and hurt.** I consistently held myself to higher standards and felt unworthy because my empathy was not reciprocated. There were many times I realized my loved ones took my actions personally when really they were manifestations of my trauma exploding to the surface. I never used my mental illness as an excuse. However, it’s safe to say it’s easier for people to take actions as a personal offense instead of taking a step back and understanding a person is deeply struggling. I no longer had to villainize the other party. Our actions are not a reflection of others, but rather of our own personal dilemmas. I attempted to set boundaries and define what I needed as repair. By examining past hurts and naming the unmet standards, I built a blueprint for what I require. Most took my hurt as a reflection of their own image, therefore refusing true accountability and empathy, and ultimately unable to recognize or honor my boundaries necessary for a baseline connection. The unfairness, anger, disappointment, and grief I felt became inspiration for my boundaries and how to show up for others. I was no longer someone desperate for approval and love, but instead a person confident in their requirements to nurture a relationship properly.

**The title of family doesn’t give someone the right of passage to my life.** The people who were supposed to love, protect, and show up for me didn’t. Instead of accepting their abuse as a reflection of my worth, it became a reflection of how far they have come in emotional development. They couldn’t meet me where I was at because of their own reckless development. They couldn’t separate the fact that good people do ‘bad’ things. That just because they are my family doesn’t mean I will give them a free pass to belittle, dismiss, and stomp on my boundaries. I will not feel guilty for cutting off family when they are unsafe. I will not betray myself to maintain a hollow title of ‘family’. No one is entitled to me.

**How to fully love myself while being the parent I never had.** I can provide myself with the safety, validation, gentle correction, and unconditional presence to heal my inner child. The shift from ""I am bad"" to ""A part of me feels bad, and I will care for it"" is the essence of this new protocol. I can take accountability for the horrible things I’ve done and still know they do not define me. Others' interpretations or assumptions of my growth also do not define my progress. I can openly admit and apologize because I value connection over maintaining my need to be 'good'. I no longer have to shame or hate myself. When I’m scared, I tell myself it’s okay to be. When I’m sad, I tell myself it’s okay to cry, and I’m safe to do so. I don’t shame myself for my emotions; instead, I welcome them. I meet my big emotions with a calm voice of safety. I encourage myself. I attempt to rewire what abuse taught me by actively listening to myself, humanizing myself, and thinking of myself as a young girl and a wise voice all at once.

**Our body holds the answers, and we must attune ourselves to listen.** Many people with CPTSD struggle with acknowledging their own bodies. In many ways, my body still feels foreign to me. But quietly, there are whispers that serve as reminders. Letting us know our body still remembers the abusive experiences and messages. Jaws that clench, lying in the fetal position, body language that collapses in on itself. All remind us of how small we still feel, the fear of anticipation, the weariness of taking up the full space of our own bodies. There are also messages of relief. Our body remembers what makes us feel good, safe, and comfortable. Fuzzy blankets, warm tea, a hot bath allow us to release a gentle sigh. Stretching, yoga, mindfulness, standing in the rain or sunshine, free the clenching for a moment. The old towns we visit, a favorite coffee shop or sandwich, a rainbow in the sky that feels like a gentle hug. Our body is constantly talking to us, having a conversation; we must practice how to listen and give ourselves what we need.

**Healing is a practice, not a set destination**. It doesn’t happen overnight or in a straight line. We absorb some lessons easily, and others we forget about and have to relearn. Over time, with practice, it becomes easier, a thoughtless habit. You cannot force it to happen; it’s a process that cannot be compared to anyone else. It isn’t an oppressive, constant upward incline, it’s a cyclical understanding. It is the waves of the ocean. Some days you float, some days you tread water, but you are no longer desperately swimming against the current.",2,1764966556.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

Its my fault


Its my fault

 
Its my fault




It's all I hear after the call with Kory's mom. 

I take four swallows of the whiskey. Relishing the burn as it drips down my throat. I get down on my hands and knees and crawl to the suitcase my mother gave me before I left the treatment center. I push over the shelf that holds my dishes so they shatter on the floor. A thousand little white pieces surround me. It's almost beautiful. 

almost. 

I cherish the feeling of seeing something for what it truly is. no more thinking something or someone is better than what i make it out to be. Theres no deep down, only surface level. There's nothing special about it. it just..is. It's just glass. 

the house is quiet today, it always gets quiet before it floods. 

When I open the suitcase my heart sinks, I notice everything is messed up and my stuff is missing.  My sketchbook, the one Kary spent her own money on, is gone, every picture I drew, every page with words scribbled on it and x-out, all my charcoals. Everything is gone. I don't know if it's possible but my heart breaks a little more with this newfound knowledge that ill never get to see it again. I'll never feel the way the charcoal fits perfectly in the curve of my hand. Or the picture of my dad I drew sitting outside of justin's rented-out garage house when I had first gotten to Georgia. 

All the pictures of Justin and Kory are ripped to shreds. if kory could see me now she'd... doesn't matter she can't, she can't ever see me again. 
The last known picture I had of my best friend is gone. My kit, my tender kit is smashed and dented. Gauze is thrown around and unraveled. The ointment exploded everywhere. Taylor and Jane came back here and trashed everything after I ran out of his house. Written on the front of the box is, ¨Love Jane¨, it bled like she knew it would. 
How could I be so stupid? Why did I think moving out here was going to work? How could I possibly be normal enough to live a life without fear? How could I believe anything would change? Of course it wouldn't change. 
I'm broken and unfixable
 I'm the glass 
spread all over the floor,
I'm in pieces and I always will be. 

It's not the people I'm surrounded by or the state I'm living in. It's me, I'm the problem and I always have been. Ever since I moved here, I've been running from something but I could never pinpoint what it was. Now I know I've been running from myself. Everywhere you go, you take yourself with you.  There's no escaping what's truly hurting you, when it's you. I wish I found comfort in myself, solitude, something, but no. i'm in despair everyday. 
Kary lied to me, Doctor Cantrell lied to me, Justin lied to me, and Taylor lied to me. They told me I was enough. They told me they were gonna be there for me when I needed them most, but look where we are now. I'm fucking alone. Everything that has happened to me, is someone else's fear. I live a life full of fear and It's a never-ending cycle. I'm a puppet and this cruel world is my puppeteer. Abusing me over and over again, pulling my strings in all the wrong directions. Tangling me up and throwing me out. This is who I am, and this is all I'll ever be. Moving to a small town in georgia was a mistake. It was a setup for failure. I don't belong here, and I don't belong anywhere. I attract broken people, and broken people attract me.

 I can't help but like the way they hurt though. Knowing they feel the pressure of everything around them is comforting in a way. It makes me feel better about myself, to know I'm not the only messed up person in this world that doesn't know what they're doing. 

 I chug the rest of the whiskey and throw the empty bottle against the wall. I'm consumed with darkness. All I ever see or feel is dark. I need to get it out, I need to cut it out. 
Out.
 Out. 
Out.
 That's the only thing I'm thinking. I'm spiraling, deep down I know I'm not thinking straight but how can I? where's my mind? where did the little voice go that tells me to stop before I go too far?
 I deserve to lose control, the only thing that i know is mine, is my mind. but my mind is over flowing, it's spilling out, i struggle to stuff my mind back together but it keeps slipping out of my fingers. I need Taylor out, celeste out, Justin , and that stupid coffee shop out. I'm confused, and unsteady,  Everythings moving so fast. My vision is black and white, and everything is spinning. Words are flying past me. I hear a voice. A mans voice, raising to a yell. Whats happening to me? Just go away,  Why cant he just go away, why does he stay with me everywhere I go?

""STOP!""


 Is this how kory felt, not being able to control your thoughts? your emotions? Did she feel this level of certainty? Knowing and understanding that at this moment, this very moment you know that the outcome of your actions will forever change the path your life takes, and you're fine with it. Fine with never knowing if it gets better or worse. Fine with the fact that somebody is gonna have to find your self-mangled body. Fine with never opening your eyes, never having to speak, and never being able to see the person you love most ever again. 
I know that feeling. for me that's kory. 
The one thing I'm thinking about right now is my kory. My poor kory. She never deserved to feel the hard truth about the world. She was never meant to feel the heartbreak of when your own thoughts consume you and there's no way out. The way the darkness plagues your mind. She was the most angelic person I had ever known and now she's just a shell of the beautiful girl she once was. Her soul was too good for this world. She had so much living to do, and so much more to learn. 
When I met her, she became the reason I stayed. It might've been wrong to stay for other people, but I knew I would never leave her. i was selfish my whole life,  except when it came to kory. I would do anything for her, if she was here right now she'd calm me down, she'd say all the right things and i'd feel secure. When the thoughts got too much, she knew exactly what to do. She was my glue, and she kept me together whether she knew that or not. When she left... I knew I'd never be the same again. 

Shes not here, anything and everything about her is gone. 

I look down at my feet and see the sea of glass on the floor. I step into myself, a mosaic of something beautiful, cruel and jagged. grinding right down into it, hard. Through stained glass eyes and colorful tears, I feel every little fragment of glass stab at the bottom of my feet. I lean down to pick up a handful of glass and paint it on my face. Over my cheeks, my forehead, my mouth, my eyes, and my neck. I feel the piercing warmth spread across my face, I know it should hurt, i should scream, but all I feel is euphoria, and i'm laughing. How powerful am i? I can disappear from the outside in and no one is coming to stop me. i'm the only one who knows whats going on and what's about to happen. It's serene. After tonight I'll never have to feel again. And to me, that sounds quite lovely. 
 I stumble towards the window. I can feel every ounce of whiskey flowing through my bloodstream and every piece of glass etching itself deeper and deeper in my feet. The window overlooks the front of the liquor store. I can just make out the two men that always sit on the sidewalk passing a brown paper bag back and forth. I am not sure what they're thinking or how they feel, but i can imagine they have an unspoken understanding of each other.  A half drunk bottle and a cigarette is all they need to get through the night, and then they part ways. i just needed somebody. 
I stand there, blood runs warm down my chin, painting my collarbone in thick, sticky trails. My shirt clings to me, suffocating. I can't tell where the tears end and the blood begins. My trembling hand is against the window. My hand, this fist, flat at first then balled up, hitting the window. Over and over again. A thousand thoughts are racing through my head but the one that sticks out is, I need more glass. I need to cut more out, maybe I can drink it, drink the glass and it'll all be over. Finally over. 
The window cracks but it doesn't break. No matter how hard I hit it, it's not breaking. I get frustrated and falter back. Its ironic, I struggle in every way I possibly can. Nothing comes easy for me, its all a challenge. I cant even kill myself without fucking up. I shuffle toward the broken dishes and get the sharpest piece I could find. 

Red is such a pretty color. From the inside of my elbow to the palms of my hands is the prettiest shade of red I've ever seen. Red has always been my favorite color and I think I know why.

the floor was cold, but the blood was warmer, it spread beneath me like a dark shadow, consuming me. i didn't move, didn't even try, there was no point. 

I know what I did, and I knew what the outcome was going to be. As I'm lying here on the cold floor, I try to take a deep breath but I am met with a burning sensation in my lungs and neck. Like my throat has been ripped out and I no longer have the option to breathe. I don't panic. What's done is done and there is no taking it back. Nobody came to stop me so that means this was meant to happen. I'm not gonna end up like Kory, and I'm not gonna end up in a treatment center again. No, this time I did it right.  As I'm left with my last remaining moments, I know there's no person in my life that will walk through that door and save me. 
  
Raven's breathing starts to slow and get more and more shallow. She feels cold but disturbingly calm. She finds a sense of comfort in this feeling. The momentary bliss where every ounce of sickness is bleeding out of her, ridding itself from her body. her body was a house that was slowly flooding, it filled her lungs up till she couldn't breathe, and no one seemed to notice. they smiled through the window as she slowly drowned.

 it was her fault.

 the waters over her head now and no one's there to pull her out. She closes her eyes and thinks back to the first time she met Kory. Walking into the cafeteria in all black, wearing fishnets, a mini dress, and big chunky boots. Kory walks right up to Raven, introduces herself, and says, ¨Thank god I found you, you're like the only normal person here.¨

1pf5ogd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lost-Manner5574/comments/1pf5ogd/understanding_digital_marketing_disciplines/,"Understanding Digital Marketing Disciplines: Digital PR, ORM, SEO, SEM, and Social Media Marketing in Las Vegas","The digital marketing landscape encompasses multiple interconnected disciplines, each with distinct objectives, methodologies, and outcomes. While these fields often overlap and complement one another, understanding their unique characteristics is essential for developing effective marketing strategies. This comprehensive guide explores Digital PR, Online Reputation Management, SEO, Search Engine Marketing, and Social Media Marketing, examining their differences, similarities, and practical applications.

# Digital PR (Digital Public Relations) in Las Vegas

Digital PR represents the evolution of traditional public relations into the digital sphere. It focuses on building brand awareness, credibility, and authority through online channels by securing coverage on digital publications, blogs, podcasts, and influential websites.

# Core Objectives

Digital PR aims to enhance brand visibility and establish thought leadership through earned media placements. Unlike paid advertising, digital PR generates organic mentions and backlinks from authoritative sources, which simultaneously boosts brand reputation and SEO performance.

# Key Tactics and Methods

Digital PR professionals develop compelling story angles and pitch them to journalists, bloggers, and online editors. They create newsworthy content including press releases, expert commentary, original research, and data-driven stories that appeal to media outlets. Successful campaigns often involve creating linkable assets such as infographics, interactive tools, or comprehensive industry reports that naturally attract citations and backlinks.

For example, a fintech company might commission original research on consumer banking habits, then pitch the findings to publications like TechCrunch, Forbes, or Business Insider. When these outlets publish articles citing the research, the company gains both brand exposure and valuable backlinks to their website.

Another effective digital PR tactic involves newsjacking, where brands contribute expert commentary on trending news stories. When a major data breach occurs, cybersecurity companies can offer analysis to journalists covering the story, positioning themselves as industry authorities while gaining media exposure.

Digital PR also leverages thought leadership through contributed articles and guest posts on authoritative industry websites. A marketing agency executive might write detailed articles for Search Engine Journal or Marketing Land, sharing expertise while building credibility and generating referral traffic.

# Measurable Outcomes

Digital PR success is measured through metrics including the number and quality of media placements, domain authority of linking sites, referral traffic from published articles, brand mention volume, and the SEO value of acquired backlinks. Tools like Moz, Ahrefs, and BuzzSumo help track these metrics and measure the impact of campaigns over time.

# Online Reputation Management (ORM) in Las Vegas

Online Reputation Management encompasses the strategies and tactics used to monitor, influence, and maintain a positive digital presence for brands, businesses, and individuals across the internet.

# Core Objectives

ORM focuses on controlling the narrative surrounding a brand or person online. This involves suppressing negative content, promoting positive information, responding to reviews and feedback, and ensuring that search results accurately reflect the desired brand image.

# Key Tactics and Methods

ORM practitioners employ multiple strategies simultaneously. They actively monitor brand mentions across search engines, review platforms like Yelp and Google Business Profile, social media channels, forums like Reddit, and news sites. When negative content appears, they implement suppression techniques by creating and optimizing positive content that outranks unfavorable results.

Review management constitutes a significant component of ORM. Businesses must actively solicit positive reviews, respond professionally to negative feedback, and resolve customer complaints publicly to demonstrate commitment to customer satisfaction. For instance, a restaurant receiving a negative Google review should respond promptly, acknowledge the issue, and offer to make amends—this response is visible to potential customers and demonstrates accountability.

A hotel chain experiencing negative reviews about cleanliness might implement a comprehensive response strategy: personally addressing each negative review with specific action plans, documenting improvements made, encouraging satisfied guests to share their experiences, and creating content showcasing enhanced cleaning protocols. Over time, this multi-pronged approach shifts the overall sentiment visible to potential guests.

Crisis management represents another critical ORM function. When negative publicity emerges, ORM specialists implement rapid response protocols to address concerns, provide accurate information, and minimize reputational damage. This might involve issuing public statements, engaging directly with affected parties, and coordinating messaging across all digital channels.

Content creation plays a vital role in ORM strategy. By consistently publishing positive, informative content across owned channels—company blogs, social media profiles, YouTube channels, and medium publications—brands can populate search results with content that accurately represents their values and offerings. A CEO facing outdated negative press might create a professional website showcasing recent achievements, speaking engagements, and charitable work, which can gradually improve their search result profile.

# Measurable Outcomes

ORM success metrics include sentiment analysis scores, review ratings and volume, search engine results page (SERP) positioning for brand terms, mention sentiment ratios (positive versus negative), and customer feedback trends over time. Tools like Brand24, Mention, and Google Alerts provide monitoring capabilities, while comprehensive analytics platforms help track sentiment changes and campaign effectiveness.

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO encompasses the technical and creative strategies used to improve a website's visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results. It represents one of the most fundamental digital marketing disciplines.

# Core Objectives

SEO aims to increase both the quantity and quality of website traffic by improving rankings for relevant search queries. The ultimate goal is attracting users who are actively searching for products, services, or information that a website provides.

# Key Tactics and Methods

SEO divides into several interconnected components. On-page SEO involves optimizing individual web pages through strategic keyword placement, compelling title tags and meta descriptions, header tag hierarchy, internal linking structures, and high-quality, relevant content. For example, an e-commerce site selling running shoes would optimize product pages with descriptive titles like ""Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40 - Lightweight Running Shoes for Men"" while naturally incorporating related keywords throughout the product description.

The page structure should follow a logical hierarchy with H1 tags for main titles, H2 tags for major sections, and H3 tags for subsections. URLs should be clean and descriptive—""example.com/running-shoes/nike-pegasus-40"" is far superior to ""example.com/product?id=12345."" Images require optimization through descriptive file names, alt text for accessibility, and compression for faster loading.

Technical SEO addresses the backend elements that affect search engine crawling and indexing. This includes optimizing site speed, ensuring mobile responsiveness, implementing proper URL structures, creating XML sitemaps, fixing broken links, and establishing secure HTTPS connections. A slow-loading website, regardless of content quality, will rank poorly because user experience is a critical ranking factor.

Core Web Vitals have become increasingly important ranking factors. These metrics measure loading performance (Largest Contentful Paint), interactivity (First Input Delay), and visual stability (Cumulative Layout Shift). Websites must achieve good scores on these metrics to rank competitively, particularly on mobile devices where the majority of searches now occur.

Off-page SEO focuses primarily on building high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites. Search engines interpret backlinks as votes of confidence—when reputable sites link to your content, it signals that your website provides valuable information. However, link quality matters far more than quantity. A single backlink from The New York Times carries significantly more weight than dozens of links from low-authority directories.

Link building strategies include creating linkable assets like original research, comprehensive guides, interactive tools, and infographics that naturally attract links. Broken link building involves finding broken links on other websites and suggesting your content as a replacement. Resource page link building targets curated lists where your content would provide value to readers.

Content optimization requires understanding user intent behind search queries. When someone searches ""best laptop for video editing,"" they're seeking comparative information and recommendations, not a product page. Creating comprehensive buying guides that address this intent increases the likelihood of ranking well and converting visitors.

Search intent falls into four categories: informational (learning something), navigational (finding a specific website), transactional (ready to purchase), and commercial investigation (researching before buying). Effective content strategy addresses all intent types relevant to your business.

Local SEO serves businesses with physical locations or service areas. This involves optimizing Google Business Profile listings, maintaining consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information across directories, accumulating local reviews, and creating location-specific content. A dental practice in Austin, Texas would optimize for searches like ""dentist near me"" and ""Austin family dentistry.""

# Measurable Outcomes

SEO performance is tracked through organic traffic volume, keyword rankings, click-through rates from search results, conversion rates from organic traffic, bounce rates, time on site, and backlink profiles. Google Analytics and Google Search Console provide foundational data, while tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Moz offer comprehensive SEO analytics and competitive intelligence.

# Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

Search Engine Marketing refers to paid advertising on search engines, primarily through pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns. While SEO seeks organic visibility, SEM purchases prominent placement in search results.

# Core Objectives

SEM aims to drive immediate, targeted traffic to websites by displaying ads to users actively searching for relevant products or services. Unlike SEO, which requires time to build rankings, SEM can generate traffic instantly upon campaign launch.

# Key Tactics and Methods

Google Ads dominates the SEM landscape, though Microsoft Advertising (Bing Ads) also provides significant reach. SEM campaigns begin with comprehensive keyword research to identify search terms that potential customers use. Advertisers bid on these keywords, and their ads appear when users conduct relevant searches.

Keyword match types control how closely search queries must match your keywords. Broad match shows ads for related searches, phrase match requires the keyword phrase in order, and exact match targets precise queries. Each match type serves different strategic purposes—broad match for discovery, phrase match for balance, and exact match for precision and control.

Ad copy creation requires balancing persuasive messaging with character limits. A typical search ad includes a headline, description, and display URL. For example, a locksmith might create an ad with the headline ""24/7 Emergency Locksmith - 15 Min Response"" with a description highlighting service areas and competitive pricing.

Ad extensions enhance ads with additional information like phone numbers (call extensions), links to specific pages (sitelink extensions), location information (location extensions), and customer reviews (review extensions). These extensions increase ad visibility and provide users with more reasons to click.

Quality Score, Google's rating of ad relevance and landing page quality, significantly impacts both ad placement and cost-per-click. Higher Quality Scores result from relevant keywords, compelling ad copy, and landing pages that deliver on the ad's promise. An ad for ""organic dog food"" should direct users to a page specifically about organic dog food, not a general pet supplies homepage.

Campaign structure involves organizing keywords into tightly themed ad groups, allowing for highly targeted messaging. A fitness equipment retailer might create separate campaigns for treadmills, ellipticals, and weight sets, with specific ad groups for different brands and price points within each category.

Remarketing campaigns target users who previously visited a website but didn't convert. These ads follow potential customers across the web, maintaining brand awareness and encouraging return visits. E-commerce sites frequently use remarketing to display ads featuring products users viewed but didn't purchase, often with special offers to incentivize conversion.

Bidding strategies range from manual CPC (setting individual keyword bids) to automated strategies like Target CPA (cost per acquisition), Target ROAS (return on ad spend), and Maximize Conversions. Automated strategies use machine learning to optimize bids based on conversion likelihood.

# Measurable Outcomes

SEM performance metrics include impressions, click-through rate, cost-per-click, conversion rate, cost-per-acquisition, return on ad spend, Quality Score, and ad position. These metrics provide immediate feedback, allowing rapid optimization. Google Ads provides comprehensive reporting, while third-party platforms like Optmyzr and WordStream offer additional optimization capabilities and automated rule-based management.

# Social Media Marketing (SMM)

Social Media Marketing involves creating and sharing content on social platforms to achieve marketing and branding objectives. It encompasses both organic social media management and paid social advertising.

# Core Objectives

SMM aims to build brand awareness, engage communities, drive website traffic, generate leads, and foster customer relationships through social platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube.

# Key Tactics and Methods

Content strategy forms the foundation of effective SMM. Brands must create platform-appropriate content that resonates with their target audience while aligning with their brand voice. A B2B software company might share industry insights and thought leadership on LinkedIn, while a fashion retailer would focus on visual content and user-generated content on Instagram.

Content formats vary significantly across platforms. Instagram prioritizes high-quality images and short videos (Reels), TikTok focuses on entertaining short-form video content, Twitter/X favors concise text updates and conversations, LinkedIn emphasizes professional content and articles, and Facebook supports diverse content types including text, images, videos, and live streams.

The content calendar approach helps maintain consistency and strategic alignment. Brands typically plan content weeks or months in advance, balancing promotional content with educational and entertaining posts. The 80/20 rule suggests that 80% of content should inform, educate, or entertain, while only 20% should directly promote products or services.

Community management requires actively engaging with followers through comments, direct messages, and mentions. Responsive brands that acknowledge customer inquiries and participate in conversations build stronger relationships and loyalty. For example, Wendy's has built a distinctive social media presence through witty, engaging responses to customer tweets, creating viral moments that generate massive organic reach.

User-generated content (UGC) campaigns encourage customers to create and share content featuring products or services. GoPro built its entire social media strategy around customer videos, showcasing the camera's capabilities while creating an engaged community. Brands often incentivize UGC through contests, hashtag campaigns, and featured customer spotlights.

Influencer marketing leverages individuals with established audiences to promote products or services. Brands partner with influencers whose followers match their target demographic. A skincare brand might collaborate with beauty influencers on YouTube and Instagram, providing products for honest reviews and tutorials. Influencer tiers range from nano-influencers (1,000-10,000 followers) to mega-influencers (1M+ followers), with different tiers offering varying benefits in terms of engagement rates and reach.

Paid social advertising allows precise targeting based on demographics, interests, behaviors, and custom audiences. Facebook's advertising platform enables brands to reach users based on hundreds of targeting parameters. An online course provider could target users interested in professional development, specific career fields, and online education, while excluding current customers and recent website visitors who haven't converted.

Lookalike audiences use existing customer data to find similar users likely to be interested in products or services. Upload a customer email list, and platforms like Facebook will identify users with similar characteristics and behaviors, expanding reach to qualified prospects.

Social listening involves monitoring conversations about brands, competitors, and industry topics across social platforms. This provides valuable insights into customer sentiment, emerging trends, and opportunities for engagement. A coffee company monitoring conversations about ""morning routine"" might discover opportunities to position their product within that lifestyle context.

# Measurable Outcomes

SMM metrics include follower growth, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), reach and impressions, click-through rate to website, conversion rate from social traffic, share of voice compared to competitors, and customer sentiment. Platform-specific analytics tools provide detailed performance data, while comprehensive social media management platforms aggregate metrics across channels.

Engagement rate typically proves more valuable than follower count—a smaller, highly engaged audience delivers better business results than a large, passive following. Brands should track engagement rate by post type, publishing time, and content theme to optimize strategy over time.

# Interconnections and Strategic Integration

While each discipline maintains distinct objectives and methodologies, their true power emerges through strategic integration. Digital PR campaigns generate high-quality backlinks that improve SEO performance. Online Reputation Management relies on SEO techniques to promote positive content. SEM provides immediate visibility while SEO builds long-term organic presence. Social Media Marketing amplifies content created for Digital PR and drives traffic that supports SEO.

Consider a product launch campaign: Digital PR secures coverage in industry publications, generating brand awareness and backlinks. These backlinks improve SEO, increasing organic visibility. SEM campaigns capture immediate search demand for the new product. Social Media Marketing amplifies the message across platforms, engaging existing customers and attracting new audiences. Online Reputation Management monitors and responds to all mentions, ensuring positive sentiment throughout the launch period.

A comprehensive content piece, such as an in-depth industry report, demonstrates this integration perfectly. The research itself serves as a Digital PR asset, earning media coverage and backlinks. It's optimized for SEO to rank for relevant informational queries. Social Media Marketing distributes the content across channels, driving traffic and engagement. SEM campaigns can promote the content to targeted audiences. If the report generates discussion or questions, ORM ensures that brand representatives engage thoughtfully with the conversation.

Budget allocation strategies must account for these interconnections. A business might allocate 30% of budget to SEM for immediate results, 25% to SEO for long-term growth, 20% to Social Media Marketing for engagement and brand building, 15% to Digital PR for authority building, and 10% to ORM for protection and enhancement. However, these percentages should adjust based on industry, competitive landscape, business maturity, and specific objectives.

Timeline considerations also matter significantly. SEM delivers immediate results but requires continuous investment. SEO builds momentum over 6-12 months before showing substantial results but provides compounding returns. Digital PR campaigns might take 3-6 months to gain traction but can generate lasting value. Social Media Marketing requires consistent daily engagement but builds community over time. ORM represents an ongoing necessity rather than a campaign with defined endpoints.

Cross-functional collaboration enhances effectiveness across all disciplines. The content created for SEO can fuel Social Media Marketing. Digital PR placements can be amplified through paid social campaigns. Customer feedback managed through ORM can inform content strategy across all channels. SEM data revealing high-converting keywords can guide SEO priorities.

Successful digital marketing strategies recognize these interconnections and develop integrated approaches that leverage the strengths of each discipline while creating synergistic effects that exceed the sum of individual efforts. Performance measurement must account for both individual channel performance and holistic campaign effectiveness, tracking how activities in one area support and enhance results in others.

Understanding these five core digital marketing disciplines provides the foundation for developing comprehensive strategies that build brand awareness, drive qualified traffic, engage audiences, and achieve measurable business objectives in an increasingly complex digital landscape. The most effective marketers view these disciplines not as separate tactics but as interconnected components of a unified strategy designed to achieve overarching business goals.

1pf5mju,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlaskanMalamute/comments/1pf5mju/malamute_reactivity_and_human_aggression/,Malamute reactivity and human aggression,"Hey all, 

I have two beautiful malamutes.  One 3 and one about 21 months.  Both were taken out often at an early age and got to see other ppl etc.  At first Gus would kiss kids and be very good with other ppl and then slowly over time, a period of 3-4 months we noticed increased aggression and reactivity.  I never knew there was a problem until he air bit at a lady in the petstore petting him, he was about 5-6 months then.  He always had resource guarding problem and I figured 90% of the issues were related, so I try to keep high value items away from him unless it is a controlled environment.  He’s been to a behaviouralist who said he’s got something wrong with his brain, and she prescribed Paxil and gabapentin,  it has not helped.

He’s has bitten my wife’s sister twice.  The only two times he’s seen her.  He has bitten me or warned me a few times.  Sometimes it can be the simplest thing like removing his harness, so now I do that outside and it seems to work better.  Can be getting into the 4Runner. He likes to be lifted in, but sometimes that will constitute a growl.  The other day we were at mcds getting a coffee and he was in passenger seat up front his front lip raised and he started growling at the girl working the window.  Today he bit my wife’s sister almost as soon as she walked in the door and there was blood dripping and she went to the hospital.

He is mean to his sister at times too and she is such an angel. I am running out of answers, he’s gone to 2-3 trainers who politely decline to work with him anymore.  I have not seen this sort of reactivity or aggression towards ppl with malamutes before.  He goes for walks everyday, he is well cared for.  We do in your place training, he loves his crate and is crate trained well, but I’m running out of options and these two are my best friend, I don’t want to lose him, but I don’t know if I can continue like this.  Feels like I am a hostage in my own home because I am afraid of how he will react.  We don’t get a lot of visitors, but when we do he is usually kissing with the wiggle butt etc, but this one sister he has bitten twice and the reactivity has sort of created this vicious circle, he doesn’t get a lot of human affection outside of the home anymore because he can’t be trusted and because he doesn’t get human affection outside of the home he doesn’t know how to engage.

He can’t even see the vet because at about 12 months when we went to get his vaccines he lunged at the vet.  He’s highly reactive and no one can handle him but me and the wife.  Anyone ever experienced this?  He’s great with other dogs which is the weird part.

Just a small vent.,"Hey guys so I (33F) was diagnosed stage 2C at 16, they thought they got all of it and didn’t, so 17 years later it popped up in a super weird rare way in my gallbladder, and then I had a met in my lung. Gallbladder tumor was the size of a lime, and one in my lung was smaller than a centimeter. So I’m currently Stage4 (the Roman numerals confuse me I’m sorry) technically NED? But one of my doctors seemed hesitant to say that even though my last scan was clear. I had two treatments of the Yervoy/Opdivo (again sorry the abbreviations and long names confuse me) which got rid of the lung tumor, and emergency surgery took my whole gallbladder with the massive tumor inside, that’s when they found the cancer had come back and found the lung tumor after my pet scan. ANYWAY two treatments of the combo fucking rocked me, my liver numbers were in the 400-500s after two treatments, so had to pause treatment for 4ish months while my body calmed down. The two treatments of the combo got rid of the lung tumor, but I was devastated that I couldn’t do the full 4 treatments because I believe that’s where my doctor said your survival rates skyrocket.  I had severe colitis from it that landed me in the hospital for 8 days, (you CAN shit yourself to death!) and was released too early, got insanely sick but had to stay home with my dogs after kicking my ex out and I literally prayed for the first time in my life that I wouldn’t die. My fevers kept spiking (did not have fevers before hospital) and I just didn’t know what to do so still don’t know what the fevers were from,  (Family was across the country I had no one) finally moved home to AZ so I could get some help from family, now that I’m finally here and just doing half doses of Obdivo every two weeks I’ve had 5 half doses so far and I’m still so freaking weak and tired and fatigued. The fatigue from the combo was nothing I’ve experienced in my life, and now (to the horror of all of my doctors) the only way I can halfway function is a pot of coffee in the morning and a cup in the evening. I’m still just so exhausted and tired I was so hopeful I would like build a tolerance and get more used to it. I guess this turned into a big rant, but I’m just feeling sorry for myself today I guess lol I can tell people in my life are sick of hearing about it because it’s like nothing new I feel like shit and I’m broke as fuck, people ask how to help like I need help cleaning my house and money for bills and groceries, I’ve even said grocery gift cards and stuff and for some reason people just would rather buy me blankets and freaking cross stitching kits! It’s all VERY kind and not malicious, but I need like food and shelter taken care of, I don’t feel good it’s not the time for me to pick up new hobbies and I think I’ve acquired 20 new throw blankets and like 15 cross stitching kits since being diagnosed. I sound like an ungrateful bitch and it’s not my intention. Sometimes I want to pretend none of this is happening and sometimes I just wanna wallow in it. Thank god my treatment is working or Idk if I could mentally handle it, I have mental health issues (diagnosed and medicated) and am a recovered alcoholic (just had 4 years sober!!!) which adds a layer of complexity to all of this. I’m just exhausted I want to go and do fun stuff and like live my life but I’m so fucking tired. I moved to a new town and don’t know anyone really (my family is two hours away but my mom is close) and forming new relationships is exhausting, and how do you even make friends when you’re sick broke and grumpy most of the time. This turned into a giant pity party and I’m sorry I’m just struggling with it today it’s gorgeous out I actually have some energy but it feels like something is wrong because since I feel good it like scares me to enjoy it because I know I’ll over do it and feel like absolute garbage the next day. This is insane I will probably delete this just needed to vent. Cancers fucking annoying, 10 more months of treatment supposedly🫠",5,1764965926.0,melahomies,3,0.86,False

Before this job I had a supervisor role as a manager at my last coffee shop. I made coffee amd managed people. I got tired of coworkers not happy with how I treated them, but usually it was cause I genuinely gave constructive criticism and maybe too much. This became soul sucking cause I felt everyone thought I was mean. I was nice at times tho. 

Now at this new job I wanted to be different and treat everyone well and be nice to everyone. I have a coworker , a cook, who I give food orders to. I often have to tell him about the food as apparently he doesn't like reading the ticket. Anyway he has been a real jerk and yelling at me even when it's his fault. Like been there 8 months amd gets order wrong occasionally then blames me. I never say anything to him just let him be a jerk, partly cause it's an open kitchen I don't want to argue when customers are close by. Also I wanted to be the nice easy going person. Now I want to quit cause I'm not a fan of getting mad and arguing all the time. I feel like it's an everyday occurrence. Feels like he treats like i am stupid but im not lol. He's getting better somewhat but still gets mad and slams the doors or moves things angrily. He did apologize to me today but still... I want to be a jerk back and be the person I once was at my last job just so I can find some sanity. What do you all think? Should I just quit or just put him in his place? I know it won't be pretty when we do argue so... I'm conflicted. Also owners already know he can be a jerk and say he is bipolar but they won't fire him. ",2,1764965901.0,barista,2,0.75,False
1pf5ibw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/1pf5ibw/feedback_upon_anahuasca_recipecooking_procedure/,Feedback upon Anahuasca recipe/cooking procedure,"Hello community out there,

 

I would like to ask for your feedback on my dosages and procedures related to brewing ayahuasca (anahuasca/mimosahuasca, etc.), as my results have been disappointing so far.

 

I will mention in advance that I have been drinking ayahuasca regularly since 2017 and have had a fairly long stay among indigenous people. So I am well protected by my diets and can take care of myself in the medicin space.

 

My experiences so far have been varied. Either the psychedelic experience has been moderately strong, medium-long in duration and with enormous diarrhea. Or it has been mild, short-lived and with almost no diarrhea.

I have nothing against diarrhea in principle, as I also consider it cleansing. But I am just used to being served medicine that has been enormously potent and with little or no effect on my stomach. (also with Mimosa hostilis and Syrian Rue)

If you would like to make comments on the following, you are very welcome. And thanks for every contribution from all of you.

 

Dosage:

I have so far used 3 grams of Syrian Rue and 15 grams of Mimosa Hostilis, but I find that I can hardly feel it (and I tend to be very sensitive otherwise!). Are my dosages wrong and what have you other good experiences with?

 

Procedure of cooking:

0. The plant material is bought from a trusted supplier and I have stored it in my basement in darkness. Mostly is has been at relatively cold temperatures, but in the summer a little warmer. But never warm in that sense.

1. I use clean tap water (ph value 7)

2. The water is made acidic with lemon juice, 1 spoonful per liter (slightly acidic, approx. pH value 4)

3. Plant material is chopped in a coffee grinder.

\- Syrian Rue is chopped roughly, so that all grains are opened, but so that it can still be sieved away.

\- Mimosa is chopped into fine wood fibers, thin threads.

4. It is all boiled in the same pot for 3x3 hours, sieved and water is changed. The water is boiled at approx. 80 degrees, so that the water in my 10 liter pot simmers gently and without large bubbles.

5. The three washes are collected in a separate pot and the plant material is sieved off with sieves of several different finenesses.

6. The pot is left overnight so that the plant material can settle. The pot is emptied in several stages: first the clean liquid which is the first 60% of the upper part of the pot which is free of plant material. Then I empty the last 40% which contains the sediment. I sieve this several times with a metal coffee filter, coffee filter, etc. I have almost turned filtering the liquid into an art form.

7. The reduction takes place at approx. 60 degrees. It takes a long time, but then it is ensured that nothing goes wrong.

8. the result look and tastes as expected, but the effect is usually not very strong or very, very bad on my stomach.

  
Do you have any comments upon what I am doing wrong?

With tools like the AeroPress, French Press, or pour-over, you can enjoy rich and flavorful coffee even in the wilderness. Each method offers distinct benefits, ensuring that your caffeine fix is not only convenient but also delicious. This guide will help you select the right brewing technique and provide tips on achieving the perfect cup in the great outdoors.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
 * Choose the right brewing method based on your taste preference and available equipment: AeroPress for espresso-like coffee, French Press for a rich body, or Pour-Over for a clean finish.
 * Utilize freshly ground coffee beans for optimal flavor; bring a portable grinder if possible.
 * Pay attention to water temperature and brew time to achieve the best extraction and flavor balance.

UNDERSTANDING COFFEE BREWING METHODS
Every coffee brewing method offers unique flavors and experiences, allowing you to customize your caffeine fix even in the wild. Selecting the right technique can significantly enhance your camping coffee ritual, depending on your taste preference, the type of grounds, and convenience. Here's a closer look at three popular methods: AeroPress, French Press, and Pour-Over.

AEROPRESS
AeroPress is ideal for those who appreciate a rich coffee with a smooth finish. This method uses air pressure to push hot water through coffee grounds, resulting in a concentrated flavor profile. Portable and easy to clean, it's perfect for camping setups where space is limited.

FRENCH PRESS
With the French Press, you get a robust brew that showcases the coffee's natural oil and flavor. By steeping coffee grounds in hot water before pressing them down, this method produces a full-bodied drink. It's slightly bulkier than other options, but the payoff is well worth it for coffee enthusiasts.

The French Press allows for versatility in brewing times, which can customize the strength of your coffee. A long to see more visit https://www.campered.com/brewing-barista-coffee-while-camping/",1,1764965767.0,campered,0,1.0,False

Days after my mental breakdown, I had another interview with 246. Supervisors believed we could convince him to say something more after given the time here and his accommodation. I obliged, sleepless, but too stubborn to do anything about it. I walked in to see 246 sitting in the chair opposite of me with the same table; one left leg over his right knee, right arm over the chair's back, sitting diagonally. He was reading a book, seemingly oblivious to my presence.

I sat down and stared at him; he didn't react. Eyes scanning the pages at a speed slower than I expected from this odd entity. I crane my neck to peak at the cover; *Jurassic Park*.

""You find an interest with dinosaurs?"" I asked.

""Nope. Never did, actually,"" he answered without looking up.

""Really? Why read it?""

""Have you ever read it?""

""No. Only seen the movie."" I had no idea what I was doing. Conversating with this unknown thing as if it were a human on lunch break. He closed the book, placing it on the table and looking at me for the first time that day. His eyes scanned me from head to hands.

""I find it tragic.""

""Not... I don't know, scary?""

He laughed.

""Okay. I'll start with a fresh question, how do you know what a dinosaur is?""

""Why wouldn't I?""

""Because you're from another world? Dimension?""

""What would make you think that?""

""Because that's what our machine allegedly does. We have confirmation from another subject.""

""You do? What silly fool said that?""

""013. He came before you.""

246 blinked; it seemed he really doesn't know who I'm talking about. A clairvoyant creature, entity, or whatever knew more about the facility than something being contained inside it. I guess I found it ridiculous. ""Whoever it is, they're lying.""

""Why would they do that?"" 246 stared at me in silence for a moment then answered, ""Classified."" My brow furrowed. ""Can I ask why just about anything you say is 'classified'?"" I had, at this point, completely forgotten the prepared questions, and slowly becoming tired of, what I saw, as a stupid game of verbal cat and mouse.

246 placed a hand on the book and pushed it forward while spinning it around for easy viewing. ""Chaos Theory,"" he answered.

""Chaos Theory?""

""Words hold more weight than man gives credit. Words interwoven together become sentences, which hold information. Information supplanted at the wrong time and place will severely effect the outcome. The last thing I, or any of my fellows, want is to carelessly influence .""

""Isn't being here influential in its own right?""

""Yes. But certain dire situations need intervention to prevent incredible disaster; very delicate intervention. I could spread my wings and flex my muscle and finish what needs to be done within moments. But I want the same as my... 'employer'. I refuse to even attempt to shackle man.""

I stared at 246 through exhausted eyes, partially taking in what he's saying, but listening all the same.  ""Why not just lie, like you claim 013 is doing?"" 246 chuckled sadly. ""Because lying is a slow venom. Far more have suffered and died from lies than truth."" I had no response to give. We sat in silence for several minutes.

""What happened to your hand?"" I looked up in slight surprise from the break of silence, then at my right hand, which was bandaged from the infirmary. ""Nothing, just... hit something on accident.""

""Fritz, I just finished a lecture on words and lies. I know when anyone is lying to me.""

""You know so much about me already, it seems, how come you don't already know?"" I spat back. Why was I so defensive? All he did was show concern, but it felt like an attack in that moment.  ""I'm not clairvoyant, Fritz. All information I have, I gained from preparation and learning. Other sources as well.""

The room went silent again. ""I... I was overwhelmed. And I fractured my hand slamming it into a table out of anger,"" I relented; 246 nodded. ""Thank you for the honesty. For willing to be vulnerable. I'm sorry for how much you've suffered, here. You're caught in between things you've no intention of being in."" I waved it off. ""He promised you her, didn't he?""

I shot a look at him. A mix of surprise and warning. He raised a hand, a gesture to settle me, I guess, though it didn't work. ""Yes, then."" More silence followed. One I expected to be broken with something about promises or wishes and warnings. But nothing came; he remained quiet.

And when he did speak, it was something cryptic. ""Sometimes, to move forward, you have to go back to the beginning.""

""What's that mean?"" He simply smiled at me without saying a word. It was then I remembered where I was and what I should've been doing. ""Oh, right, uh...,"" I grabbed my clipboard for the first time since sitting down and pulled it over my lap to read. ""You once mentioned working under someone or something, what is that someone or something?"" I looked up and saw his smile had not changed. ""Classified.""

The hour afterwards were filled with various probing questions and similar avoidance of answering them. As we parted, he did not lunge at me, but simply awaited to be taken back, reading that book. In between the doors, waiting for the second to open, I felt... a little renewed. Like I had just taken a seat from being on my feet all day. Maybe I needed to talk to someone after all. But, as I walked out and toward the supervisory room, I remembered the beginning of the interview and worried I had unprofessionally revealed my problems, not only to 246, but to the viewing of my coworkers. Little did I know, that didn't matter.

When I entered the room, The few supervisors there stood behind a sitting technician. ""What's going on?"" I asked. Don looked over and said, ""Techies are finally looking into our camera problems. We lost a significant amount of the feed from your session."" I sped over to look at the monitor. ""Which parts?""

""See for yourself."" I skimmed the footage in the program. Somehow, large swathes of the beginning completely cut off for long periods of time. Only stabilizing into something understandable after I began the official questions. Every part involved me being vulnerable had gone unseen by my colleagues. A strange, coincidental boon, almost like something sought to keep my privacy on my behalf.

After finishing up the notes, I left to clock out early and get some rest. For the first time in years, well beyond a decade, then, I didn't drink. I just laid in bed and wondered. Then my mind went to that thing 246 said. *To move forward, you have to go back to the beginning*. He brought specific attention to it. I spent as much time pondering over it until sleep took me.

Once morning came, I drank coffee and slowly came to an idea to try. I didn't know what 246 wanted me to know or do, but he is here for something of major importance, that much he gleaned. Perhaps he was 'interfering' with me. Or I actually began trusting him. I submitted a request, and got it approved for the afternoon. No supervisory questions, strictly my own. Some might view the feed, but it wasn't mandatory. For the first time, I walked in without a feeling of fear or mundanity, but with some confidence.

I walked into the interview room, set up the table and my chair, then sat down. Almost immediately, but slowly, 001 retrieved his chair and also sat down across from me. At this point, I had dozens of interviews with 001 under my belt. I'm sure there was a lot of files with drawings from 001. All of which only ever were portraits of me across from him.

""Hello, again, 001.""

Of course, 001 did not react; simply stared.

""I brought more crayons and paper if needed. But I come here with some new questions straight from me. The crayons and paper are, of course, provided in case of an answer. I don't expect much. You may draw another portrait if you so wish. If you can even understand me.""

001 did not react.

I placed several sheets of paper in front of him along with an equal amount of crayons. ""First question."" I took a printed sheet of paper from the clipboard and presented it in the middle of the table. ""This is a picture of the newest addition to the facility: A-246.""

001 flicked his eyes at the picture.

""He's told us... honestly, very little. But I think he told me to talk to you again. He somehow knows about you, but do you-"" I blinked and saw a green puck roll around the table. Immediately, I looked at the papers in front of him. But it was blank. ""Okay... Uh, before him, we had welcomed a very large addition."" I pulled another printed sheet, and placed it next to the one of 246. ""A-222."" I look up as another puck rolled around; a dark purple one.

My eyes widened; 001 had his right hand balled up. A significant new reaction that he's never done. I don't know if it was a sign of anger, or a residual consequence of his drawing speed. 001 didn't have body language to tell or reveal anything. I leaned in, dropping my volume unintentionally. ""What do you know, 001?""

I blinked as he stared at me, and heard the tiny sound of another puck rolling. I looked down and had my breath taken away; 001's hand was moving. He lifted the pile of paper, then extended the hand in my direction. I hesitantly and carefully took them. He slowly replaced his arm back to its original position.

The first of the pile, smothered in green, was an image I couldn't make out. I turned my head every which way along with the paper but just couldn't grasp what was drawn. I gave up and moved on to the next. The second was just purple all over; but I could tell exactly what it depicted. I've seen it hundreds, if not thousands, of time.

The Machine.

I added it to the green page and looked onto the final page. Draped in blue, something like a rock was depicted. Bumps and dents all over and even a large hole in it, at its base. But, clearly, near the top was a set of various odd symbols, placed around and over a six-pointed star; another odd symbol at the center.

I stared at it, trying to figure out that odd thing's significance. ""What is this, 001?""

001 did not react.

I sat, looking between the papers and 001. Without more to go on, I decided to end the interview session there. I gathered the sheets together, holding them in my right and my clipboard in the left, under my arm, and made my way to the exit. ""This is significant, 001, I will make sure to-""

Turning back, 001 was suddenly right up close to me, making me lurch and yelp slightly. Faster than I've seen it, at normal human speed, he snatched the papers from me and held them up with both hands, pinching the corners between his fingers and thumbs. Right before my eyes, I saw them disintegrate from the center-out, between those fingers. I stared at the empty space they once were as 001 slowly lowered his arms back down.

I looked up and met his gaze.

I've just started watching the series and currently at the point where they've boarded the ship.

I've got no clue why people find TV their relationship romantic or why Alexandra is considered charismatic.

First woman we saw flirting with Spencer was married. He sat down by the table, drank coffee and she started boggling him even though she was married.

Honestly, when Alessandra came over to the bar to talk to Spencer I saw no difference between her and that other married woman. Can someone specify?

Then later on she is painted to be charismatic but really all I see is an entitled blonde...no hate BTW because I'm a blindé myself.

She sort of clung onto Spencer, made him take her. At no point could I see Spencer pursuing her. It felt almost as if she threw himself onto hin:
""take me with you. I don't want to stay here. I want the adventure""

That's it... I don't see anything else.

Also, Spencer is painted to be this mysterious character with post war trauma so I thought that maybe there will be someone extra special...

For example, Jacob's wife's character is incredible. Just the way she looks at someone alone gives you shivers.

To be honest, I haven't found anyone in 1923 or Yellowstone to be so... Just Meh..

Is it just me and can someone explain to me what is special about Alexandra?

Tl;dr I find Alexandra from 1923 annoying and don't get why people find her and Spencer's relationship romantic. Can someone explain?

There's negative reviews on Amazon about that thing exploding. I read them myself...after ordering the pot. Some people also complained that the handle was getting too hot and that they had to use oven gloves. However, I have a high tolerance when it comes to handling hot things, so I wasn't concerned about that.

I made a pot full, which will go down the drain. The instructions are too small, I cannot read them, but I know how to break in a moka pot, you have to wash it and then make a few batches that you discard so it's clean from any potential industrial grease and other unpalatable stuff.

What I noticed is that it was fairly fast and filled up quickly, I raced it against a 2 cup Brikka, on the same stove, and it didn't take much longer than the Brikka. The handle barely got hot at all. I think if the handle is too hot to the touch, it's probably because people put it into the center of an electric hob or turned up the heat too high. Or both.

It didn't explode, and I didn't expect that to happen, either, because everything was in good order and I didn't do any experiments like compacting the coffee, using additional filters and such stuff.
