1jpvlpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jpvlpm/34f4m_western_canada_online_looking_for_an_online/,34[F4M] Western Canada / Online - looking for an online connection !,"

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jpvktd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alphaandbetausers/comments/1jpvktd/looking_for_testers_for_finsnap_a_budgeting_and/,Looking for testers for FinSnap - a budgeting and spending management tool with AI powered categorization and wealth simulation.,"Hey Testers!  
  
I just launched the MVP for FinSnap – a simple, privacy-friendly budgeting and forecasting tool with a few unique twists.

**Why I built it**

I’ve spent years in finance and kept running into the same pain points with personal budgeting tools: they’re either too rigid, too invasive (hello, bank linking), or just plain bossy (sorry YNAB!). And for myself personally, one of the biggest pains was going through my credit card transactions every couple of months and itemizing everything.

So I decided to build something lighter, faster, and a little smarter.

**What FinSnap does (so far)**

**AI-powered transaction categorization**

Paste in your CSV or copy-paste your transactions – FinSnap uses LLMs to auto-categorize spending in seconds. No need to link your bank account, so it's safer and more flexible. You can also just describe what you spent money on.

**AI-powered Budget Builds**

When making a budget, you can simply describe what you think the budget should contain. For example ""In 2025 I will spend $5.99 every weekday on coffee at Starbucks"". It will generate budget item for every weekday so you can compare on a daily, weekly, monthly basis how you're doing.

**Multi-currency support**

Supports USD, CAD, EUR, AUD, and JPY right out of the gate – great for travelers, expats, or side hustlers juggling accounts in different currencies.

**Wealth simulator**

Input your assets, income, and savings rate to get a sense of where you're headed. Uses randomized future paths to show a range of long-term outcomes (not just a single line).

**No data selling, easy signup**

Signup is easy, currently with the first month free and at $4.99/mo thereafter. Right now I'm looking for good feedback, so happy to extend free trials if you like where this is going.

**What’s next - Looking for feedback!**

If you're into personal finance, LLMs, or product feedback – I’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.

[https://www.finsnap.ai](https://www.finsnap.ai/)

I'm building this solo and would really appreciate thoughts on UX, pricing ideas, or anything you think could make this more useful to people.

I'm currently looking for a new group this tier (7.2). I have previously progged/cleared tiers on Tank, Phys Ranged, and Healer though I find every job in the game fun so if push came to shove I think I'd be fine going melee or caster. Right now I have full 740 sets on Dancer and Sage. Any other role I might need help with gear.

Why me? Well I'm a normal dude. I'm a social person, like to joke around, I work well in groups and I believe in picking others up instead of calling out people. Let's be for real I make mistakes too. This game is supposed to be fun after all. Outside of XIV I'm into sports, traveling, coffee, plants, and breweries. I'm available during the week Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 7ish-midnight. I do travel for work on occasion and may have to push back the time a bit (which is where the ""ish"" comes into play) BUT 90% of my jobs are on EST though. Every other night id be willing to prog more if I don't have anything going on.

What I'm looking for in a group - I'd prefer a group that's looking to go pretty hard at this. If it means raiding 3-4 nights a week for 3-4 hours I'm cool with that. I enjoy other games and doing other things and realistically just kindly dont want to still be progging 4-5 months from now. As much as I do love this game I do enjoy breaks from it to play other stuff or do other things. So yes, preferably a group that's looking to go hard at this and be done in a few months.

Feel free to check my logs. Character name is Amalia Rhul. The numbers last tier weren't great as I was playing DNC and our rDPS was a little less than good I'd say due to having new/still ascending players. In fact the group disbanded during M3S. If you take a look at some others I think you'll find I'm more than competent.

Find me on Discord at ryanaaron117. Dude in the red hoodie and black jacket/hat? You found me.

Later everyone! Happy Progging!

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder after so many years of needing it. It runs on both sides of my family but much moreso from my mother.

I had gotten mood stabilizers (lamictal) and have been so much better. (Got it too late though but that's another story...)

So, i came into work today and was immediately in a good mood. I did wake up early and managed to get myself coffee before coming in. But I am a morning person and don't actually need coffee, I just wanted the seasonal specials from Dunkin. (I'm also a workaholic so there's that)

Anyway, rarely do i come in and be in such a good mood i start singing to my music. I'm very bashful about my singing voice. But today, I didn't care.

I am easily irritated. I did get irate earlier but I had a reason. Some stuff wasn't getting done and I had to take it up in myself to do them. 

I'm still in a good mood. However I don't know if I'm experiencing mania or if I'm just genuinely in good spirits. 

Before my diagnosis, I was always paranoid about being in a good mood as something bad would happen to humble me almost all the time. I'm still like that now, but not nearly as bad or as much. So, my judgement on my emotions is clouded because of that trauma. 

I've always been wondering this. Any clarity would help, especially from fellow peeps with this diagnosis than Google.",1,1743617108.0,bipolar,0,1.0,False
1jpvc8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1jpvc8u/built_finsnap_an_aipowered_budgeting_tool_with/,Built FinSnap – an AI-powered budgeting tool with multi-currency support & a built-in wealth simulator,"Hey Indie Hackers 👋

I just launched the MVP for FinSnap – a simple, privacy-friendly budgeting and forecasting tool with a few unique twists.

**Why I built it**

I’ve spent years in finance and kept running into the same pain points with personal budgeting tools: they’re either too rigid, too invasive (hello, bank linking), or just plain bossy (sorry YNAB!). And for myself personally, one of the biggest pains was going through my credit card transactions every couple of months and itemizing everything.

So I decided to build something lighter, faster, and a little smarter.

**What FinSnap does (so far)**

**AI-powered transaction categorization**

Paste in your CSV or copy-paste your transactions – FinSnap uses LLMs to auto-categorize spending in seconds. No need to link your bank account, so it's safer and more flexible. You can also just describe what you spent money on.

**AI-powered Budget Builds**

When making a budget, you can simply describe what you think the budget should contain.  For example ""In 2025 I will spend $5.99 every weekday on coffee at Starbucks"".  It will generate budget item for every weekday so you can compare on a daily, weekly, monthly basis how you're doing.

**Multi-currency support**

Supports USD, CAD, EUR, AUD, and JPY right out of the gate – great for travelers, expats, or side hustlers juggling accounts in different currencies.

**Wealth simulator**

Input your assets, income, and savings rate to get a sense of where you're headed. Uses randomized future paths to show a range of long-term outcomes (not just a single line).

**No data selling, easy signup / no commitment or credit card needed**

Signup is easy, currently with the first month free and at $4.99/mo thereafter. Right now I'm looking for good feedback, so happy to extend free trials if you like where this is going.

**What’s next - Looking for feedback!**

If you're into personal finance, LLMs, or product feedback – I’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.

[https://www.finsnap.ai](https://www.finsnap.ai)

I'm building this solo and would really appreciate thoughts on UX, pricing ideas, or anything you think could make this more useful to people.

I realized I wanted to be home and wanted to try to make it work. I was miserable and having to work all the time because I was spending so much then I had to pay back what I borrowed and I needed money to spend… basically I was super unhappy. Fast forward to now I’m back with my husband, home and I’ve realized I wanted to be with him I was miserable and we were both terrible for each other then. I worked doubles and 6/7 days a week occasionally having 1 day off every other week or at least working 1 shift to give myself a break. I hate everything that happened but I don’t think I deserve to be tortured over it forever. My husband even admitted he purposely treated me badly when I was mad just to do it. He had a list of money I owed him and I had to pay him for every single thing. I needed coffee to function I wasn’t sleeping but maybe 3-5 hours a day(I was night shift) and shit just went south. It’s not an excuse for what happened but I quit my job, I’m a stay at home mom and I take care of my family now. It was stupid what happened and he admits he gets how it all happened but he’s still mad at me. He says he’s just sad over it but he takes it out on me and it makes me(an already depressed, bipolar person) want to die. I take meds to keep myself alive I guess(just not well) I want to be dead or think about it probably 85% of the time. The rest I’m content and I love my family… if it weren’t for my daughter I’d probably have killed myself a long time ago. It’s not that I don’t want to die because I literally will close my eyes at night and beg to not wake up. I always do though. I hate that. I always think that when I finally am doing good that’s when I’ll die and that’ll suck. I don’t know I guess I just needed to vent about everything. He got mad earlier and called me a bunch of names and said I don’t deserve my family… he’s not wrong. If he really hates me so much then why not just let me kill myself? If I’m dead then I’m completely out of the way. He doesn’t have to share the kid, he gets everything. I don’t see a down side to me being dead other than they have to burry me or cremate me and that’s a one time thing.

Now, I'm not typically one for conspiracy theories, nor am I claiming any concrete truths here, but consider this sequence of events:

* I settle down with my morning coffee, open TradingView, and see Tesla down around 6% pre-market. Just as the market opens, a sudden news alert appears: **""Musk to leave Tesla in one way or another.""** Almost instantly, Tesla starts rapidly closing the gap.
* After briefly stabilizing near yesterday's close, another perfectly-timed news alert flashes across my screen, igniting Tesla like a rocket and sending it soaring upward faster than Usain Bolt out of the blocks.
* I'm watching, amazed, as Tesla goes from -6% to +5%. Just when it looks ready for another bullish sprint—**PING**—another alert: **""Tesla's worst quarter ever; analysts say Tesla is beyond redemption.""**
* The stock instantly plunges, diving faster than a skydiver without a parachute. Just when things look dire—**PING**—another alert reiterates, **""Musk leaving Tesla.""** Magically, the price recovers.

The precision timing of these news alerts made it feel as if someone was deliberately trying to control the stock's movements—like using a kitchen faucet to regulate a dam.

Of course, this could be purely coincidental. Stocks react to news; we all know that. But today's perfectly timed news releases really made me pause.

Hot cup of coffee on one side, sleeping cat on the other. At this very moment, all is right in the world - in spite of any of the various shitstorms roiling around me. Personally, politically, or otherwise.  

This is one of the…uh…let’s just say “way too many” sets I purchased during AE’s recent anniversary sale. I have a crapload of other sets already here or en route, but I decided to begin building this particular one first because I’ve been coveting it ever since it was released. I am definitely not any sort of art historian, but I’ve perused some museums here and there, and I’ve taken a few courses as well. Van Gogh’s work always piqued my interest. And when I first saw Lego’s interpretation of Starry Night, it struck me as “holy shit, you can do THAT with plastic bricks?”  

To frame my reaction a little differently: I think it looks amazeballs.

And so a thought occurred to me over the course of the day, as I was diligently ignoring work and connecting brick to brick to brick: what are you other Flego/Lepin fans building right now? I mean, not necessarily at this very second, but what do you have in progress? And perhaps more importantly - *why*? Please share.",1,1743616414.0,lepin,7,0.6,False

The quest for the ultimate listening experience frequently enough boils down to a head-to-head battle between the titans of the headphone world. In this comprehensive comparison, we dissect the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the Apple AirPods Max, two premium over-ear headphones vying for the top spot in 2025. Both represent the pinnacle of audio technology, boasting advanced noise cancellation, exceptional sound quality, and a luxurious design. Choosing between them requires a deep dive into their features,performance,and suitability for different listening needs. So, let's settle the debate: Which is better, AirPods Max or Bose QuietComfort Ultra?

[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max)
## Diving Deep: Understanding the Contenders

Before we pit these audio behemoths against each other, let's establish the landscape. Both the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the Apple AirPods Max target discerning listeners who demand the best. They both are categorized as high end headphones, but cater to slightly different user bases. The AirPods Max, deeply integrated into the Apple ecosystem, appeal to loyal Apple users who prioritize seamless connectivity and intuitive controls. The Bose QuietComfort ultra, inheriting the legendary QuietComfort legacy, emphasizes unparalleled noise cancellation and a versatile listening experience across various devices.

This isn't just a battle of specifications; it's a clash of philosophies. Comparing Apple AirPods Max Bose QuietComfort Ultra means understanding what each brand prioritizes. Apple emphasizes user experience and ecosystem integration, while Bose focuses on performance, notably noise cancellation and balanced sound. Understanding these core differences is crucial for making an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max)
## Design and Comfort: A Matter of Personal Preference

The first point of contact with any headphone is its design and comfort. The AirPods Max feature a distinctive,minimalist aesthetic with a stainless steel headband and breathable knit mesh canopy. This design, while undeniably stylish, comes with a important weight factor. Some users find the weight fatiguing over extended listening sessions.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra adopts a more traditional headphone design, emphasizing comfort and portability. They feature plush earcups and a lightweight construction, making them ideally suited for long flights or all-day wear at the office. The QuietComfort Ultra's foldable design also allows for easy storage and transport, a valuable advantage for frequent travelers. The AirPods Max, while incredibly stylish, lack this inherent portability.

Thus, when considering AirPods Max vs Bose QuietComfort Ultra comfort, the Bose frequently enough wins out for longer listening periods and travel. Though, the AirPods Max's premium materials and striking design will appeal to those who value aesthetics above all else.

## Noise Cancellation: The Silent Revolution

Noise cancellation is a critical factor for many headphone buyers,especially professionals,travelers,and anyone seeking refuge from the cacophony of modern life. Both the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the Apple AirPods Max boast exceptional noise-canceling capabilities, but they achieve it through different approaches.

Bose has long been the gold standard in noise cancellation, and the QuietComfort Ultra doesn't disappoint. Its advanced digital noise cancellation technology effectively silences a wide range of ambient sounds, from the droning of an airplane engine to the chatter of a busy coffee shop. The result is an immersive listening experience, free from distractions.

The airpods Max also deliver impressive noise cancellation, utilizing a complex array of microphones to analyze and neutralize external sounds. While its noise cancellation performance is excellent, some critics argue that the Bose QuietComfort Ultra offers a slightly more effective and consistent overall noise reduction, especially in challenging environments.

Thus,in the arena of Bose QuietComfort Ultra vs AirPods Max noise cancelling,Bose likely edges out Apple for raw,unadulterated noise-canceling prowess.The Bose is simply built for superb noise isolation.

## Sound Quality: A Symphony of Nuance

Sound quality is the heart and soul of any great headphone, and both the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the Apple AirPods Max deliver exceptional audio performance, albeit with different sonic signatures.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra strives for a balanced and natural sound signature, presenting music with clarity, detail, and accurate frequency response. This makes them well-suited for a wide range of genres, from classical music to electronic dance music. The Bose emphasizes preserving the integrity of the original recording, offering a obvious and uncolored listening experience. For audiophile headphones, the QC Ultra represents a versatile and reliable choice for general listening.The AirPods Max, on the other hand, offer a slightly more sculpted and immersive sound signature. Apple emphasizes bass response and clarity and users appreciate the emphasis on highs and Lows. While the AirPods max delivers detail and excitement, some audiophiles find its sound signature slightly less neutral then the Bose QuietComfort ultra.

So, when pondering Bose QuietComfort Ultra vs AirPods Max sound quality, the choice depends on personal preference. The Bose excels in delivering a balanced and accurate sound, while the AirPods Max provide a more engaging and dynamic listening experience.[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max)
## Features and Functionality: Beyond the Basics

Beyond the core performance metrics, features and functionality play a crucial role in the overall user experience. The AirPods Max stand out for their seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. They offer features like automatic device switching, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and intuitive on-ear controls.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra doesn't offer the same level of ecosystem integration, but it boasts a robust set of features of its own. It includes customizable EQ settings, adjustable noise cancellation levels, and multipoint pairing, allowing you to connect to multiple devices simultaneously.

When you compare headphones feature wise,the AirPods Max shines with seamless integration within the Appleverse. However, the bose offer greater flexibility outside of the Apple ecosystem, and that is the major difference between AirPods Max and Bose QuietComfort Ultra.

[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs apple airpods max)
## Battery Life: Endurance Test

Battery life is a practical consideration for any wireless headphones. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra offers a commendable battery life, typically lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge with noise cancellation enabled. That allows for near-endless listening time. The AirPods Max, on the other hand, offer a slightly shorter battery life, typically lasting around 20 hours with noise cancellation enabled.

For frequent travelers and heavy users, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra's longer battery life will offer a significant advantage. However, both headphones offer fast charging capabilities, allowing you to quickly replenish the battery when needed.

## Price and Value: The Bottom Line

Price is always a key consideration when making a purchase decision. Both the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the Apple AirPods Max occupy the premium end of the headphone market. Generally speaking, the Apple AirPods Max price tends to be higher than the Bose QuietComfort Ultra price.

While both represent a significant investment, their value depends on your individual needs and priorities. Apple ecosystem users will find that the advantages of seamless integration justify the purchase of AirPods Max, while those seeking unparalleled noise cancellation and a more versatile listening experience may find the Bose to be a better value. Keep an eye out for AirPods Max deals and Bose QuietComfort Ultra deals to perhaps snag a discount.

1jpuypf,https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1jpuypf/how_to_care_for_your_fragile_delicate_afably/,"HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR FRAGILE, DELICATE, AFABLY, FRIGHTENED LITTLE DOOD BEFORE HE PERISHES IMMEDIATELY","Congratulations! You have acquired a Dood, a tiny, skittish creature that clings desperately to life despite his inherently pathetic nature. This is a monumental responsibility because, let me be clear:

##**HE CAN DIE AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON.**

With proper care, he may one day become a strong, confident poonchad, but until then, it is up to YOU to stop him from simply perishing.

Follow this guide carefully. One misstep, and he is gone.

***

###**HABITAT**

Your Dood requires an extremely specific environment to survive. Even the slightest miscalculation can cause instant expiration.

**DO provide:**

- A dimly lit cave-like space where he can hide when overwhelmed. A hoodie works in a pinch.
- A gentle, supportive ecosystem of friends who call him bro at regular intervals.
- A single mirror, but at an angle. If he catches his reflection head-on before he is ready, he will dissolve into an impotent afab rage.

**DO NOT:**

- Expose him to sudden bright light. His body will instantly enter fight-or-flight mode.
- Let him near a Hot Topic unattended. He will disappear for weeks.
- Allow him unrestricted internet access. You will find him dead in a puddle of blood and other body fluids.

***

###FEEDING

Your Dood does not know how to feed himself properly. Left alone, he will survive solely on energy drinks and the occasional beef stick.

**FEEDING TIPS:**

- Place food near him and walk away. He may be too shy to eat while you watch.
- Occasionally tap his water bottle to remind him it exists. If needed, add ice cubes to trick him into drinking.
- If he is refusing food, say, ""Hey bro, you need protein to get big.""
*This will activate his survival instincts.*

**WARNING: If he consumes nothing but black coffee for 24+ hours, he will enter a Feral State. Symptoms include:**

- Unprompted monologues about masculinity
- Shadowboxing
- Sudden urge to build a shelving unit

If this occurs, gently lure him back to reality with a warm meal and a gentle, ""You're doing great, little man.""

***

###HANDLING

Your Dood is incredibly delicate. If you handle him incorrectly, he will shatter like glass and you will be held legally and morally responsible.

**DO:**

- Allow him to approach you first. Sudden movements will cause him to retreat.
- Occasionally say, ""Hey man, your shoulders look real solid today."" This keeps him alive.
- Let him show you his stuffies collection. This is a sacred ritual.

**DO NOT:**

- Pick him up suddenly. He will kick his little legs wildly and may break his thin and fragile bones.
- Touch his facial piercings. They have not healed and will instantly become infected.
- Corner him with direct emotional questions. He will freeze up and pretend to be dead.

##COMMON HEALTH RISKS

***

Your Dood exists in a constant state of danger. Here""s how to prevent a tragic, avoidable fate:

OVERHEATING IN A BINDER
- If he is sweating but refusing to acknowledge it, he may be overheating.
- Say, ""Hey dude, let""s take a break,"" and gently lead him to a cool, safe environment.
- Offer him a sports drink and a loose hoodie as a peace offering.

DYSPHORIA-INDUCED HIBERNATION

If your Dood suddenly becomes still and unresponsive, he has entered a dysphoria nap. Try gentle encouragement:
- ""Hey bro, your jawline is looking sharp today.""
- ""Dude, you have the energy of a warrior.""
- ""Would you like to look at cats?""
- If he does not respond, place a flannel shirt near him and wait. He will emerge in 2-3 business days.

ESCAPE ATTEMPTS

If left unattended for too long, your Dood may attempt to leave his enclosure. He is small and quick and may become lost under furniture or in large crowds. To retrieve him, gently strum a ukulele and call out, ""Bro?"" in a concerned tone. He will hesitantly return.

***

##**WHAT TO DO IF YOUR DOOD DIES**

If your Dood collapses, do not panic. He may be playing dead to avoid stress. Follow these steps to confirm his status:

1. Check for signs of life. Call out, ""Hey dude, I like your haircut."" If his fingers twitch, he can still be saved.

2. Offer a protein bar. If he sniffs it but does not eat, gently place it into his mouth.

3. Whisper the Sacred Words of Revival:
    - ""Your arms look bigger today.""
    - ""I need your help lifting something heavy.""
    - ""Hey man, I saw this cool survival knife I think you'd like.""    If he slowly regains consciousness, place a hoodie over his shoulders and allow him to recharge in a dark, quiet place.",35,1743616194.0,4tran4,15,1.0,False
1jpuybu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1jpuybu/wanted_to_share_some_more_helpful_tips_for/,wanted to share some more helpful tips for digestion from my physical therapist,"Due to moving apartments I have had to find a new physical therapist for pelvic floor, so my first session with her we discussed lifestyle changes to aid digestion. She is familiar with SIBO, and I think a lot of us can benefit by implementing these strategies. Here are her recommendations:

- Have a morning routine. Implementing a morning routine can help your body learn when to have a bowel movement. For me it looks like this— wake up and take linzess, have a cup of coffee, go on a 10-15 minute walk. The light rhythmic motion in your abdomen from walking (NOT running, it’s too intense) stimulates digestion. Then do a colon massage, (making small circles with your fingers going up on the right, across, and then down the left). Then have breakfast. 

- Have structured meal times. You want your digestion and bowel movements to be on a schedule. Eat meals at the same time every day. And try to limit snacking. 

- Maximize the stimulation of eating. Focus on the smell of the food, how it looks, feels in the mouth, and how it tastes. Don’t be distracted doing other things while eating. You want to maximize the senses to signal to your brain to start digestion. Chew at least 15 times per bite. This is also a signal to start digestion. In between bites, take a deep breath (belly breathing, expanding your diaphragm). It’s another signal that your body should be in the rest and digest state, and route blood to your digestive tract.   This has been the most beneficial for me thus far, as I hear way more gurgling when I belly breathe while eating.

1jpuv9d,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/the-curse-of-cokelek-village-horror-story/,The Curse Of Çökelek Village,"The event I am about to recount concerns Osman Kağan, who lived in Çökelek village, bağlı to the Büyükorhan district of Bursa, made a living from animal husbandry, lost his mother and father at a young age, and lived alone. The names of the people mentioned in this event will not be changed. The event will be narrated from Osman Kağan’s perspective.

It was September 1983. The cold had slowly begun to show its effect, and the villagers had started preparations for winter. I woke up early in the morning and took the animals out of the barn. A few days earlier, the handle of the axe had broken while I was chopping wood. I was sitting in the barn repairing the axe handle. About 50 meters in front of my house, there is a cemetery that the villagers call the “desolate cemetery.” My late mother and late father also lie there. For the past week, I had been hearing strange sounds from that cemetery. While repairing the axe handle, I heard the same sounds. As always, I didn’t pay much attention and continued my work.

After about five minutes, I heard the same sounds more intensely. It was as if someone was asking for help. I hastily threw the axe handle somewhere and ran towards the cemetery. Since the cemetery was very old, the hornbeam, plane, and oak trees there had grown quite tall. Even during the daytime, the cemetery didn’t get much sun. The sound started to get louder. I could now clearly hear what was being said. I heard words like “We came to take,” “You shouldn’t have done it.” When I shouted, “Who’s there?” the sounds suddenly stopped. When I went a little further, I saw words similar to Arabic on the trunk of the hornbeam tree at the head of my mother’s and father’s grave.

Cemal, the son of Ali Ağa, one of the village elders, knew about these things. He is also my dearest friend. I ran, got Cemal from his house, and brought him to my parents’ grave. I told him about the strange sounds I had been hearing for about a week and the incident I experienced. He hesitated for a bit. “I don’t know what’s written, but I know someone. We’ll go soon and find out what it is,” he said. After talking for a while, I invited him to my house. While I was putting the animals in the barn, Cemal repaired the broken axe handle. I finished my work and went to him. The sun was slowly setting; evening had fallen. I saw Cemal off and came home. I lay down by the stove.

My mother and father came to my mind. They had died when I was five. I never fully learned the reason why. My uncle raised me. He passed away ten years ago. Whenever I asked, “Uncle, how did my mother and father die?” he either changed the subject or brushed me off. After a while, I got tired of it and didn’t ask anymore. But when I was twelve, I heard something from the village neighbors: My mother and father had hanged themselves at dawn while I was asleep. I haven’t been able to accept it since I heard it. They wouldn’t have hanged themselves for no reason.

While thinking about my parents, I was startled by a dog barking outside. Sleepiness had overcome me. I went out, closed the garden gate, and checked the barn door. I entered the house. As I lay by the stove thinking about today’s event, the door suddenly knocked. I got up and opened the door. As soon as I opened it, I felt the blood drain from my veins. My mother and father were looking at me, saying, “Melun!” (Cursed!). I felt a breath on the back of my neck and turned around. My uncle was looking at me with his pupils turned red. He started strangling me with his hands and whispering something in Arabic. When I looked at the door again, I saw my mother and father hanging by their necks inside the doorway. Suddenly, I jumped out of bed at the sound of the morning call to prayer. I was out of breath. I felt a pain in my arm, but on one hand, I was somewhat relieved that what I saw was a nightmare, and on the other hand, having this nightmare after today’s event scared me quite a bit.

I couldn’t sleep due to the effect of this event. I waited for the sun to rise. As soon as the sun rose, I opened the barn door and let the animals out. After having breakfast and filling my stomach, I headed to Ali Ağa’s house. Cemal was chopping wood in the garden. When he saw me, he dropped the axe in his hand. “Welcome, brother,” he said and invited me inside. We went inside and sat down. We chatted for a bit. I told Cemal about the dream I had at night and asked the meaning of the word “melun.” He said the Turkish meaning of “melun” is “lanetli” (cursed). For the dream, he said, “You must have been affected after seeing those writings yesterday. Nothing to worry about,” which relieved me somewhat.

While we were talking, Cemal’s mother, Saadet Teyze, entered. As long as I’ve known her, Saadet Teyze doesn’t speak. Not wanting to be rude, I never asked Cemal about it. Saadet Teyze is a bit stern. So far, apart from a few smiles, I haven’t seen even a slight grin on her face.

Cemal said, “Let’s take another look at that writing, brother.” I said, “Okay,” and we set off. On the way to the cemetery, I asked, “Who is this person you mentioned, Cemal? Who are they?” “I swore not to say anything about this man, Osman. You’ll see when he comes anyway,” Cemal said. Since he said that, I didn’t insist much. When we reached the graves, we saw that a branch of the tree had broken and covered my parents’ grave. We quickly lifted the branch, and Cemal suddenly started screaming. There was a black snake on my mother’s grave. I laughed and said, “Are you scared of this, brother?” and shooed the snake away from the grave with the tree branch. Cemal’s face had turned white as a sheet. Cemal and I have been friends for thirty years. One morning when he was very young, Cemal was bitten by a snake. He has been afraid of snakes ever since. This incident came to my mind later. “I’m sorry, brother,” I said. He nodded his head as if to say it didn’t matter.

After catching our breath for a bit, we went to my house. While Cemal was sitting in the courtyard, I went inside to make tea. While I was inside, Cemal suddenly shouted, “Melun!” I dropped what I was holding and ran outside. “What happened, brother?” I asked. Cemal looked at me blankly. “What are you talking about, brother?” he said. I told him he had just shouted “melun.” Cemal looked at my face in astonishment. “Sorry, brother, it must be the effect of the dream,” he said and went inside. But I was quite sure Cemal had shouted. When I brought the tea to him, Cemal was staring at me with his eyes wide open. He stood up and started shouting. At that moment, I suddenly startled. Cemal said, “I’ve been calling you for two hours, didn’t you hear?” I had been daydreaming while standing. It was the first time something like this had happened to me. I told Cemal how he had just stared at me with wide-open eyes and shouted. He did nothing but stare in astonishment.

The sun was slowly setting. Cemal said, “If you want, I can stay with you tonight, brother. You seem quite affected.” I replied, “Am I a child, brother? It’s just a dream,” and saw Cemal off. I put the animals in the barn and went into the house. I made myself Turkish coffee, sat on the cushion, and started thinking about the events of the past two days. The night prayer call was being recited. The coffee hadn’t kept me awake; on the contrary, it made me feel even sleepier. I got up from the cushion, washed the cup, and then lay down.

Suddenly, lightning flashed, illuminating the inside of the house. During that flash, I saw my mother and father in front of the door. Then lightning flashed again, and this time they appeared right in front of me. My mother had a black snake in her hand. She had no pupils. My mother shouted, “Melun!” and placed the black snake on me. Then, suddenly, they both disappeared. Lightning flashed once more, and I saw both of them hanging by their necks from the ceiling. The snake coiled around my neck and started squeezing. Suddenly, I startled awake at the sound of the morning call to prayer. I remembered yesterday’s dream. I had seen my mother and father hanging themselves again. This event was starting to anger me more than scare me. But this time, I had fallen asleep while waiting for the sun to rise.

I opened my eyes to the sound of roosters. I got up and washed my face. I opened the barn door. One of the animals was missing. I went inside and looked. One of them was lying on the ground. No matter how hard I tried to lift it, it wouldn’t get up. While I was having breakfast in the courtyard, it suddenly screamed and started running outside. When it screamed like that, I ran towards it. I entered the barn and looked where the animal was lying. The black snake we saw in the cemetery yesterday was inside the barn. I ran home to get the scythe to cut the snake’s head off. When I returned to the barn, the snake was gone. Even though I searched the barn thoroughly, I couldn’t find it. With that fatigue, I went to the courtyard to rest.

Just then, Cemal arrived and said the man we were waiting for would come today. “You said he would come in three days?” I said. “This man is unpredictable, Osman. He might say he’ll come in a month and show up a week later,” he replied. We went to Cemal’s house together and started waiting in the courtyard. Before long, a boy aged 15-16 came and told Cemal, “Brother, Kamuran Amca is waiting for you.” Cemal, the young man who came to call us, and I set off. The man lived in a dilapidated house among the beech trees, five kilometers beyond the village. I had seen this house many times while grazing the animals, but I had never gone to look. As we approached the house, the young man who came to call us said, “I can only come this far, brother. Continue alone from here,” and left. I looked at Cemal as if asking, “Why can’t this boy come?” Cemal paid little attention and continued. I followed him.

The walls of the house were built with stones, and the garden was entered through an iron gate. When we reached the iron gate, Cemal said, “You wait back,” and knocked hard on the gate once. A tall, well-built man with a black turban on his head came out from inside the house. This must be the Kamuran Amca the young man mentioned. The man staggered slightly towards the iron gate and looked into Cemal’s and my eyes, nodding his head as if welcoming us. I was a little scared of the man. There were Arabic words written on the door of his house. Seeing those writings scared me even more. The inside of the house smelled bad. There were small livestock feet and heads everywhere. On the wall of the house, there was a strange shape drawn with red paint. The man pointed to the brown cushions on the floor and said, “Please, sit.”

We sat down. Cemal explained the cemetery incident. I also recounted the dreams I had had in the last two days. After listening, the man looked into my eyes for a few seconds. Then he asked, “What are your mother’s and father’s names?” I said Nazik and Süleyman, respectively. The man wrote a few words in Arabic on papers, then asked my name and added another word at the bottom of the paper. He stood up, took the copper bowl from the large wooden table, and sat down. He dipped the copper bowl into the cloudy water in the large copper container in front of him and took some water. He dried his hand with an old white cloth and threw the paper with the Arabic word written on it into the water. After reading something in Arabic for about 15 minutes, he blew his breath into the copper bowl and, looking at me, said, “Drink this water.” I was afraid to drink the water, but since the man had spent a long time on it, I felt obligated to drink it, and I did. After drinking the water, Kamuran Amca said, “Look into my eyes.” When I looked into his eyes, I started yawning. I couldn’t understand what was happening. I continued yawning repeatedly. After the yawning stopped, he didn’t speak for a while. Looking into my eyes angrily, he said, “Let’s go check that grave.”

We all went outside and headed towards the cemetery. When we reached the village, the sun was about to set. Cemal turned to Kamuran Amca: “Be our guest tonight. We’ll go look tomorrow in daylight,” he said. Kamuran Amca was silent for a moment, then turned to me. “I hear you live alone. It would be more appropriate for me to be your guest at your house tonight,” he said. I didn’t want Kamuran Amca to be a guest at my house, but again, I felt a great sense of responsibility and nodded my head. Cemal went into his house. As Kamuran Amca and I walked towards my house, he suddenly turned to me and said, “There is a great danger upon you, son. God willing, we will save you from this danger,” and smiled. Because of this sentence, I warmed up to Kamuran Amca a little. We went home, and I prepared a place for Kamuran Amca to sleep and made tea. Since Kamuran Amca arrived at the house, he had been looking at the ceiling. I couldn’t ask because I felt shy. “Strange, very strange,” he said suddenly. I asked, “What’s strange, Kamuran Amca?” “It’s nothing important. Pour the tea so we can drink,” he said.

We drank tea and talked a bit. I told him about the events I experienced in more detail. He just nodded his head while listening to what I told him. He didn’t say anything reassuring about the situation. “I’m sleepy, is my place ready?” he asked. I didn’t like his tone, but without showing it, I said, “It’s ready, uncle, ready.” I showed him his place, and he lay down. After tidying up, I lay down in my own place.

Before long, a sound came from inside, from the room where Kamuran Amca was sleeping. I couldn’t understand exactly what he said. I quickly went to the room. Kamuran Amca was standing with his back turned. He suddenly turned to me and smiled. He started walking slowly towards me. The inside of the room suddenly darkened for some reason I didn’t know. Kamuran Amca wasn’t visible. I felt a pain in my left arm. When I lifted my arm, I saw a black snake squeezing my wrist. The room lit up for a few seconds. There was at most one step between Kamuran Amca and me. He had no pupils. “You’re dead, son,” he said, pointing upwards. Above, I saw my mother and father hanging by their necks. Their tongues were out, their faces were purple, and they were staring into my eyes with their eyes wide open. I suddenly jumped. The morning call to prayer was sounding again. I had gotten somewhat used to these kinds of dreams by now. With all my composure, I went to Kamuran Amca’s room, but he wasn’t there. Just then, a sound came from outside. I went out. Kamuran Amca was standing in front of the door, watching the garden. I called out. He turned to me and said, “You stay inside.” I didn’t understand what was happening. I went inside and waited for Kamuran Amca to come. Soon after, he came inside. He told me to recite Surah Nas 21 times and went to his room. I did as he said and then lay down.

I woke up to the sound of the door. Cemal had arrived. I got up and opened the door. At that moment, Kamuran Amca also came out of his room and greeted Cemal. We had breakfast together in the courtyard. I did my usual chores, and they chatted a bit in the courtyard. Kamuran Amca suddenly stood up. “The time has come, let’s go look at that cemetery,” he said. We all set off together. As we walked to the cemetery, I heard Kamuran Amca saying something in Arabic. When he saw the writing on the tree at the head of the graves, he started yawning again, just like yesterday. I couldn’t understand this yawning at all. I turned to Cemal and asked, “Why is this happening, brother?” Cemal put his index finger to his lips and said, “Shush.” Kamuran Amca’s yawning had passed. He turned to me and asked, “Why did your mother and father die?” I replied, “They died when I was very young. Fate came and took their souls, but I don’t really know.” Kamuran Amca was silent for a moment. Without waiting for him to speak, I asked, “What does it say on the tree, uncle?” Looking at the tree, he said it read “1951.” At first, I couldn’t make sense of this number, but then the date my parents died came to my mind: they died in 1951. I told this to Kamuran Amca. He continued looking at the tree for a while. He turned to me and said, “There is magic on this tree, son. Let’s go home, I have a few things to tell you.”

Without saying anything, I walked ahead towards the house in astonishment. Kamuran Amca and Cemal followed behind, talking. When we got home, we saw Cemal’s mother, Saadet Teyze, standing in front of the barn door, looking at the barn with her back turned. I called out, “Saadet Teyze!” but she continued looking at the barn without changing her posture. Cemal took his mother’s arm and brought her to the courtyard. He sat her on a chair and asked me to bring a glass of water. I brought the water. Saadet Teyze drank the water and suddenly stood up and walked towards her house. When I asked Cemal the reason for this, he said she had been acting like this for about three weeks. At this point, Kamuran Amca looked at Cemal and said, “Go to your mother.” Cemal, not understanding what was happening, headed home. Kamuran Amca entered the house angrily. I followed him. “What happened, uncle?” I asked. Kamuran Amca frowned. “That woman is not well, son. She is possessed by jinn, that woman is possessed!” he said. I’ve known Saadet Teyze for a long time; she has never harmed me, and I like her. After hearing what Kamuran Amca said, I was a bit surprised but didn’t pay much attention to his words.

Before long, Cemal came into the garden shouting. Kamuran Amca and I went outside. Cemal said, “Something happened to my mother, help!” Cemal and I ran to the house. Kamuran Amca came a bit behind due to trouble with his foot. Saadet Teyze was lying stretched out in the room, staring at the ceiling and trembling. Just then, Kamuran Amca entered the room and started reciting something in Arabic loudly. As Kamuran Amca recited, Saadet Teyze’s trembling increased slightly. Saadet Teyze suddenly sat up and looked into my eyes, saying “Melikun!” and fainted a few seconds later. I looked at Kamuran Amca and Cemal in astonishment and fear. Saadet Teyze was a woman who hadn’t spoken as long as I’d known her. How could she speak? More than her speaking, the word she said and it being the product of what I experienced scared and astonished me greatly. Kamuran Amca looked at Cemal and me and shouted, “Get out of the house!” Cemal and I went out into the courtyard without understanding what was happening. Kamuran Amca was reciting Surahs loudly inside. A few minutes later, screams were added to Kamuran Amca’s voice. These screams coming from inside belonged to Saadet Teyze. Cemal couldn’t bear it anymore and went inside. I was following him. The screams had stopped. Saadet Teyze was still lying on the floor. There was blood around where she lay. We looked at Kamuran Amca blankly. There was something bloody in Kamuran Amca’s palm. We went out into the courtyard without paying attention. Cemal took his mother to her room in shock. I followed Kamuran Amca out into the courtyard.

Kamuran Amca was washing his hand. He had placed the thing from his palm on the marble stone in the courtyard. As I looked at it, unable to understand, Kamuran Amca angrily said, “That cursed thing.” I asked what that thing was. Kamuran Amca sat on the chair in the courtyard without paying any attention. I asked again. He looked into my eyes and said, “That is a piece of a mercilessly made spell.” I looked in astonishment at the thing lying on the marble stone. It looked like flesh; one side was slightly whitened, and the other side was blackened. Just then, Cemal arrived. Kamuran Amca told Cemal the same things he had told me. About an hour later, we all entered the room where Saadet Teyze was lying. She was lying semi-conscious. She startled a bit when she saw me. Kamuran Amca recited something in Arabic. The things he recited visibly relieved Saadet Teyze. Saadet Teyze sat up a bit and said to Kamuran Amca, “May Allah be pleased with you.” I was astonished once again. The woman who hadn’t spoken for years suddenly spoke.

Kamuran Amca asked Saadet Teyze the reason for her silence. Saadet Teyze frowned and looked at me. I couldn’t understand her gaze. She started getting increasingly angry. “That man called İbrahim, his uncle, did this!” she said. Cemal looked at me and suddenly shouted, “What did you do to my mother?!” Kamuran Amca grabbed Cemal by the shoulder, pulled him closer. I had no information about what Saadet Teyze had gone through. I only remember my uncle bowing his head and being unable to look Saadet Teyze in the face whenever he saw her. I went out into the courtyard, sad and angry. Kamuran Amca followed me. “You go home, I’ll find out what happened and come,” he said. After what Cemal said, I didn’t really want to stay there much longer. I went home without objecting.

A few hours later, Kamuran Amca arrived. He looked at my face in astonishment. “Tell me a bit about your uncle. What did he do, what kind of person was he?” he asked. I said he was a bit stern and engaged in animal husbandry like me. Kamuran Amca was silent for a moment, examining the ceiling. He suddenly went outside, took the log I used for chopping wood, and placed it in the middle of the room. He climbed on it and looked at the ceiling. He got down and moved the log. I watched him without asking what he was doing. There was a small hole in the ceiling towards the door. He gently tapped the middle of the small hole with his hand. A round piece of wood pushed inwards, creating an opening in the ceiling large enough for a human hand. He reached his hand inside and found an amulet wrapped in black cloth. I continued watching him in astonishment. He got down from the log and sat on the cushion. He began to carefully open the amulet. After opening the amulet, he took a piece of meat from the inner pocket of his robe. As soon as he took out the meat, a foul smell filled the room. It was a piece of meat. He cut the piece of meat with a knife he also took from his robe’s pocket. Inside it, there was another small amulet. I was becoming increasingly astonished and scared.

As I watched what Kamuran Amca was doing, I was startled by the sound of the door. It was Cemal. He looked sad and angry, entered, and sat next to Kamuran Amca. I closed the door and sat down next to them. Nobody spoke. Kamuran Amca said, “We need to go to my house. There are things I need. The sooner we finish, the better.” We set off hastily. When we arrived at the house, it was dark. Kamuran Amca lit a few candles and placed them in the corners of the room. He took a gas lamp next to him and sat down. Cemal and I sat opposite him. He read the writings inside the amulet. He took a piece of string several spans long and tied knots. He threw the amulets into the cloudy water in the copper bowl. He handed the string to me and said, “Hold the string over the bowl. Repeat what I say. Untie one of the knots each time I bow my head.” I did as he said. He took the papers out of the water and told me to drink the water. I drank the water.

Kamuran Amca said, “We will stay here tonight.” Cemal said he needed to be with his mother. Kamuran Amca nodded his head and saw Cemal off. Cemal not even looking at my face as he left the house surprised and saddened me greatly. I was starting to get tired of not understanding the events I was experiencing. Kamuran Amca closed the door and sat back in his place. Time had passed. Kamuran Amca showed me where I would sleep and said, “Don’t be afraid, you will sleep comfortably tonight.” I lay down, thought about the day’s events, and fell asleep before long.

I startled awake to the sound of a scream. I sat up and rubbed my eyes. When I turned my head, I felt as if my soul was leaving my body out of fear. Kamuran Amca, Cemal, Saadet Teyze, my mother, my father, and my uncle were lined up side by side, sitting and laughing at me! I immediately got into bed and pulled the blanket over my head. A few seconds later, someone pressed on my shoulders and made me lie on my back. I couldn’t see anything through the blanket and couldn’t move. It was as if I was frozen solid.

I woke up to the sound of the call to prayer. I felt pain in my shoulder. What Kamuran Amca had said came to mind. He had said I would sleep comfortably tonight. So what was this dream I saw? I waited in bed for the sun to rise. Kamuran Amca wasn’t there. He came inside as the sun rose. I went to him and told him about the dream I saw. He looked at me and said, “This matter will be resolved today, don’t worry.” After having breakfast together, we set off. Cemal met us at the garden gate. He said Saadet Teyze wanted to talk to me. As I was heading inside the house, I saw Saadet Teyze coming out into the courtyard. I went up to her and looked at her face without saying anything. Pointing to a chair, she said, “Sit.” She sat on the chair opposite me and said, “Your uncle cast a spell on me too, son. Because of him, I couldn’t speak for years.” I looked at Saadet Teyze in astonishment. After being silent for a moment, I asked, “How did it happen, Saadet Teyze?”

Saadet Teyze recounted what had happened. Once upon a time, my father and uncle found a large treasure. My uncle was very jealous of my father. To extract the treasure, they found a hodja from a nearby village. The hodja said this treasure belonged to jinn and could only be extracted by making a pact. Although my father didn’t want to accept, my uncle forced him to, and they extracted the treasure. My mother and Saadet Teyze were very close back then. When my father told my mother about these events, my mother didn’t keep it secret and told Saadet Teyze. One day, Saadet Teyze saw my uncle on the road and told him she knew everything and that if he didn’t give her a share of the treasure, she would tell the whole village. Although she regretted saying it afterwards, it was too late. My uncle didn’t want to share the treasure with anyone. To possess the treasure alone, he had a spell cast on my mother and father. I was four years old at the time. One day, Saadet Teyze came to our house. When she entered the house, she saw my mother and father hanging from the ceiling. Just then, my uncle came home and witnessed Saadet Teyze seeing this event. Saadet Teyze ran home and didn’t tell anyone anything. Fearing that Saadet Teyze would tell someone about the events she saw, my uncle had a spell cast on her, and Saadet Teyze’s tongue was tied. My uncle hid the treasure gold in the barn. One day he went to get it but couldn’t find it and regretted what he had done. Although he went to Saadet Teyze to ask for forgiveness, Saadet Teyze never forgave him.

I was very surprised after hearing these things. Kamuran Amca said he wanted to look at the barn, and we all went towards the barn together. I took the animals out of the barn and started cleaning the mess there. I told Kamuran Amca where I saw the snake. He told me to bring a pickaxe and shovel from outside. I took the pickaxe and shovel and started digging where I saw the snake. As we dug, Kamuran Amca was saying something in Arabic. Suddenly, the ground shook, and Saadet Teyze started screaming. I threw the pickaxe I was holding to the ground and went to Saadet Teyze. Cemal and I held her arm together. Saadet Teyze shouted in a loud voice, “If you don’t give those golds, blood will be shed!” Kamuran Amca opened his hands and recited Arabic verses. As he recited, the shaking intensified, and blood started coming from Saadet Teyze’s mouth. Before long, the intensity of the shaking decreased, and Saadet Teyze came to her senses. Turning to Kamuran Amca, she said, “If you don’t hurry, they will come here!” and turning to me, she said they would take my life. I took the pickaxe and continued digging quickly. After digging for a while, the pickaxe hit something hard. A large pot emerged from the place we dug. Kamuran Amca told me to bring a large cloth from the house. I went home and brought the cloth. Kamuran Amca lifted the pot and slammed it hard on the ground, and blood flowed out of it! Cemal, Saadet Teyze, and I were astonished. Kamuran Amca calmly covered the spilled blood on the ground with the cloth and said we needed to go outside. After we went out, he continued reciting verses loudly.

About half an hour later, he called us inside and told us to lift the cloth. When we lifted the cloth, we saw that the blood had turned into gold! Kamuran Amca asked for a sack to fill the gold. After finding a sack and filling it with gold, Kamuran Amca asked Saadet Teyze where my father and uncle had extracted the gold from. Saadet Teyze said they found it in one of the nearby villages, which had been abandoned for years. Cemal, Kamuran Amca, and I took the gold and set off. When we reached the village, evening was about to fall. Kamuran Amca said that such treasures are usually under beech trees. There was only one beech tree in the village. Without wasting time, we started digging right next to the beech tree. Kamuran Amca was reciting jinn verses. We dug until we opened a pit large enough to fit the gold. When the pit reached that size, we put the gold in and buried it. The sun had completely set. After burying the gold, we set off.

On the way home, I asked Kamuran Amca what the “1951” writing on the tree at my parents’ grave meant. “Your uncle had a spell cast on your mother and father in 1951. They performed this spell in the same year. The jinn haunting your mother and father didn’t leave them alone even in their graves. They wrote these numbers on the tree at the head of their grave,” he said. I couldn’t fully understand, but since I was somewhat happy that we got rid of these things, I didn’t dwell on it much.

It was midnight when we arrived home. Kamuran Amca and I went to my house. Cemal went to his own house. As soon as we got home, I prepared Kamuran Amca’s place. I lay down in my own place. With the fatigue of the day, I fell asleep immediately. When I woke up in the morning, I noticed that Kamuran Amca hadn’t woken up yet. I got up, washed my face. I went outside, opened the barn door, and let the animals out. I went back into the house. Kamuran Amca still hadn’t woken up. Thinking, “He must be tired,” I didn’t want to wake him. I made tea and prepared breakfast. Just then, Cemal arrived. “How have you been since we last saw each other, brother?” he asked. I replied in astonishment, “We just saw each other yesterday, brother, what are you talking about?” Cemal looked at my face blankly. I thought he was acting this way due to the effects of the events and said, “Sit down, let’s have breakfast, brother. Kamuran Amca will wake up soon too.” Cemal looked at my face and asked, “Who is Kamuran Amca?” I thought he was joking and started laughing. When Cemal didn’t laugh, I became serious and went inside to check on Kamuran Amca. When I entered the room where Kamuran Amca stayed, I realized no one was there.

I returned to the courtyard, to Cemal’s side. “Cemal, are you okay, brother?” I asked. I looked at Cemal’s face without saying anything. A few seconds later, Cemal took a prayer bead from his pocket, handed it to me, and said, “I bought this for you from Istanbul, brother.” After hearing this sentence, I felt like boiling water was poured over my head. I told Cemal about the events we had experienced together over the last three days, but Cemal denied each one and said he didn’t even know Kamuran Amca. I wanted to show Cemal Kamuran Amca’s house. We set off together. We walked towards the house among the beech trees, but the house wasn’t there!

I must have fainted. I opened my eyes in Cemal’s house. Saadet Teyze had brought me water. I sat up and drank the water. I asked Saadet Teyze, “How are you, auntie?” Cemal was looking at me blankly. Saadet Teyze looked into my eyes sternly for a few seconds and then left. No one else knew about the events I had experienced in the last three days. I couldn’t get over the shock of the event for a while. The writing on the tree at my parents’ grave was also gone.

I didn’t want to stay in this village any longer. A year later, I sold the animals and moved to Istanbul. Whenever the event comes to my mind, I see my mother and father as in those nightmares. But I don’t want to let go of this event. There must be a reason for the three-day event I experienced.",1,1743615976.0,ParanormalHorror,0,1.0,False

She came over for a quick breakfast and chat. We sat at the counter together, and I removed my rings (my engagement ring and my wedding band) to keep them clean while eating. There was something odd happening outside, and I got up suddenly to go have a look. I had bumped her while doing so and made her spill her coffee. While cleaning it up, she said I knocked my ring off the counter as well and that she had picked it up. There was only the engagement ring on the counter. I began frantically searching for the wedding band when I realized that it was not near where the other one had fallen. We had a bit of a laugh that I reacted so crazily to what was happening outside, but kept looking. She helped look very briefly before saying she had to get going. I walked her to her car and returned back inside to continue searching for the next three hours. We turned the house upside down. It’s NOWHERE. She has not reached out to ask if I’ve found it. I did call her the next day, sad and begging her to check her pockets and shoes, and that we’ve looked everywhere, including the cat’s litter boxes. She laughed and said she would look, but that she had already checked her pockets when she was here. We hung up and she didn’t text back until the next day that she had looked and found nothing.


I don’t want it to be true, that she could have taken something with so much importance and sentimental value. We’ve been best friends for the last 13 years and I would be crushed. I haven’t confronted her yet because I don’t have any concrete evidence to accuse her and I am scared to risk the relationship. My husband has researched kleptomania and is convinced she took it but that it is not her fault if she did. She makes good money, so if it’s true I believe it’s more compulsion than a need for money.


There have been other incidences that I never considered her, but would make sense if this is true. A few years back, she spent the night and I could not find a pair of nicer yoga pants. I even asked if she may have grabbed them by accident but she flat out just said no. Another time, she joined me, my husband and his friends for a beach fire. As we were leaving, one of his friends realized his wallet had gone missing, that he had placed it on the log next to him and it was gone. We all combed the area but to no avail.

As I watched your latest MM in a VOD (I’m European) and was enjoying it, 
I wanted to provide an alternative point of view justification. 
Your claim is that if the ruling party A will ban the opposition party B, it will only make party B more popular. 
This is the statement I disagree with. 
Let me explain my point with example:

Let’s get back to France. 
If you let RN win as soon as they get popular, then they are in power for next 4 years.
Otherwise you try different tricks and stall their win, French people might start seeing how much Trump screws up the situation in the US and his local EU copies (RN, AfD, etc.) will get less and less popular, eventually giving some more chance for more moderate parties, ultimately saving democracy in France. Recently you made a statement that after Trumps inauguration Liberals in Canada got much more popular. So if we think about it, sometimes kicking a can down the road, does solve the problem or at least makes chances better. 

Even in the case of Trump, one might argue that he was elected to stabilise the economy and end world conflicts and by doing the opposite he cheats the democratic system of the United States. 
Many people voted for him not for invading Canada and Greenland or not for destruction of democracy (3rd term talks). Are the people who didn’t expect this naive, speaking lightly? 
Yes they are, but that’s beside the point. 
The world is much more complicated than we think. 
The way I see it, Macron sacrifices the reputation of his own party trying to time things right. 
At the end of the day, there still is a war happening in Europe and one of the major European powers electing a right-wing Russian puppet might make the situation much worse. 

Just some opinion of an unknown EU frog.
Otherwise, I thank you so much for your content. 
I literally watch it every day.

**Location & First Impressions:**  
Situated in the heart of Cancun’s Hotel Zone, this resort has one of the best beachfront spots I’ve ever seen — calm, crystal-clear waters and powdery white sand. Unlike other Cancun resorts with rough waves, Coral Beach is perfect for swimming, paddleboarding, or just floating in peace. The check-in experience was smooth, and I was greeted with a refreshing drink and a warm welcome that set the tone for the entire trip.

**Rooms & Views:**  
Every room at this resort is a suite — mine had a large oceanfront terrace that was perfect for morning coffee and evening stargazing. The decor felt upscale yet cozy, and the beds were ridiculously comfortable. It felt like a five-star experience with a strong sense of personal space and calm.

**Dining Experience:**  
One of the highlights was the food. If you’re looking for **Cancun all-inclusive resorts with gourmet dining**, this is the one. From the elegant Le Basilic (French-Mediterranean cuisine, think lobster ravioli and truffle oil everything) to the immersive dining show at The Table and authentic Mexican dishes at La Joya — every meal was memorable. Room service was prompt and top-notch too.

**Gem Spa & Relaxation:**  
The **Gem Spa** is easily one of the best resort spas in Cancun. I treated myself to the 10-step hydrotherapy ritual (included in some packages), and it was pure bliss. The aromatherapy steam room, contrast showers, and heated stone loungers melted every bit of tension away. If you’re booking a **Cancun spa vacation**, do not skip this.

**Family & Kid-Friendly:**  
Although I traveled solo, I noticed lots of happy families and couples. The **Coral Kidz Club** looked amazing — high-tech, creative spaces for kids to play while adults relax. Definitely a great pick for a **Cancun family resort with activities**.

**Final Verdict:**  
Having visited other high-end resorts in the Riviera Maya, I can honestly say **Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach Cancun** is in a league of its own. The location, food, staff, spa, and beach access were all next level. Whether you're planning a romantic **honeymoon in Cancun**, a luxury solo retreat, or a family getaway, this resort checks every box.

If you’re browsing Reddit and trying to decide between **Hyatt Ziva vs Grand Fiesta Americana**, or looking for **Cancun resorts with oceanfront suites and spa**, I’d say Coral Beach has the edge for elegance and personalized service.",1,1743615613.0,CancunAllInclusives,0,1.0,False

Have a goal to see decent results (not perfect results) in 3 months. Details below","Long read, to summarize I need help with a calestinc and running program that fits into a 70 hour a  work week, working nights, while also carting the kids around and doing house stuff with the goal to see decent results in 3 months. Also open to diet suggestions.


More details:

So I havent worked out in a while and Im in the worse shape Ive ever been in and need a sorta cut the bullshit kick in the ass routine. My weight gain sorta crept up on me since I work alot and my work clothes sorta conceal it.

I went from 32 to 34 waist in jeans, in suits Im not 100% sure. The suit pants I had when I was in better shape still sorta fit, I carry most of the gained weight on my stomach/belly. Im overweight, but not like huge overweight ya know. Im not sure exactly what I weight, probably 220 maybe a little more?. My neck sized increased from maybe a 16-16.5 to 17.5, and while I dont wear suits often I went from looking pretty good in them to sorta good as long as Im wearing a jacket and vest.

I need a jump start routine. I know there is no magic bullet. But my goal is to drop enough weight in 3 months to justify getting a nice suit that I will look good in (I fiqure setting up a timed goal will keep me motivated).  

Here are the obstacles that I need to work around:.

Time constraints:

I work alot, and I work nights. Most weeks Im working about 70 hours a week, either 7pm-7am or 10pm-6am.

During the day I take the kids to school and pick them up and take them to extra activities. My wife does this as well sometimes, but she works during the week (with maybe a.day or two off during the week) so typical mon-fri its on me. So my sleep schedule is sorta messed up. Since in addtion I have to cook and clean do around the house stuff. 

Im also doing an online 9 week program, not too intense but it does require watching videos while taking a lot of notes, weekly reading assignments and a weekly project.


Diet:

I intake a lot of caffine via energy drinks. I know that this is huge factor (Monsters). If anyone knows a good alternative (like powederd energy that I can mix with water) Im all ears--cant do coffee.

I know a calorie deficit will help, but I also want to regrow the muscle I used to have.

Sleep: 

my sleep schedule is F@cked, and honestly thats probably not gonna get better, so I think this is just a ""i gotta deal with being tired all the time"" thing.

Here are my thoughts, but you guys may (probably) have a better way:

Due to my work and kids schedule I fiqured Id do calestincs at first, at least that way I can create a habit and eliminate excuses (dont have time to go.to.the gym/get the weights out/whatever)
 to work out 4-6 times a week, then dropped down to 3-4 days after we had kids, but for the past 4 years probably I really havent done much except for the sporadic workout. Im not consistent at all. I used to love lifting weights, but due to my schedule it can be difficult to get to the gym. I have a set of adjustable weights...but I fiqured a calestinc workout (maybe 21s with pushups/body squats/crunches) with running would sorta get me back into a habit, and I thought it would be easier to fit into my hectic schedule?

Im open to all suggestions. I do need to incorporate running. I absolutely hate running but  I do need to incorporate it.

 I used to have to do 21s  pushups,body squats, and crunches (or trade crunches out hello dollies or laying leg raises sometimes for variety) work. 1 set of 21 each back to back, then rest 2 minutes, then 1 set of 20, rest 2 minutes, then keep going until Im all the way until 1 set of 1) do it? Maybe a every other day thing with the oppsite day being running?

Im open up to any suggestions. Im aiming for a 3 month goal to see decent results. I really dont care about weight, just looking better (two people can weight the same and look drastically different due do good weight vs bad weight.

My wife fucking *hates* the smell of it. I don't know much about coffee but I joined r/pourover because I was interested in learning more about it if this could potentially solve my problem. 

For years I’ve avoided getting an espresso machine or even a drip brewer because the aroma is just too much for her. Says the entire upstairs smells like nothing but coffee when my parents visit. So I’ve settled for drinking it solely at work or just going without. I’m working from home now, so I no longer have coffee in the morning unless I go out for it (which I don’t enjoy the experience of).

Recently, a buddy of mine from Colombia gifted me a bag of some higher-end coffee (never heard of the brand Cafe Gavi before, but that's not surprising since I haven't had coffee in my house in years). The beans smell really good, but to keep the peace, it’s currently living in the back of our freezer like contraband.

I’d hate to let it $80 of coffee go to waste, so I’m wondering: would pour over be more “aroma-friendly” if I grind by hand and keep everything as low-impact as possible in my office? I know there will always be *some* smell, and I’m okay with a little compromise, but if I can make a great cup without filling the whole house with the aroma of coffee, that might finally be the sweet spot or I may have to find a way to make it in my attic.

I don't know if anyone else been in this situation. Just wanna know how does pour over compare to drip or espresso in terms of how much the smell lingers? I imagine way less since its one cup at a time, but I'd appreciate any help. Thanks in advance. ",5,1743615319.0,pourover,20,0.86,False

It causes me extreme dehydration, anxiety, twitchiness, jaw tension, insomnia even if i drank it like 8 hours ago. Then once it wears off I just feel empty and dead inside like just a shell of a human and so dysphoric. 

(Just to clarify on the source of the coffee, it's any and all sources, starbucks, family members coffee makers in their kitchens, gas station canned coffees, etc.)

I am leaning towards thinking that it could be depleting something in me, some type of mineral or precursors that I am not getting enough of... but idk because I never hear of others with this problem so it could possibly be genetic?

I only have coffee less than once per month, because of these awful side effects and that sometimes I feel like these symptoms are worth the tradeoff if i have excruciating period cramps or if I just have to get something done by a deadline and get my dopamine going. Perhaps it could be that my dopamine building blocks are deficient. idk really anything about dompamine synthesis and all those biomechanisms relating to this stuff tbh so I'm just hoping anyone here knows alot more about this particular topic to point me in the right direction to figure out whats going on.

I guess other cases in the franchise are so amazing that they managed to make a already good case become less memorable. I had so much fun playing Turnabout Sisters, it was way more fun than The First Turnabout, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole trial part.

This case is the first appearance of Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe and Miles Edgeworth. Even though I've played this case before, the part where you learn that Maya Fey is all alone is so sad. She was just arrested and put into a detention center after discovering her sisters corpse, her father is dead and her mother is missing. Learning that about her in the detention center is so sad, I felt sorry for her, she's a way more sympathetic defendant than Larry who kinda just acted like a stupid petty cartoon character.

I know Gumshoe gets better as a character but it kinda annoyed me that he arrested Maya just because her name was written in blood, it's kinda stupid though I get that's the point, if this was my first time playing Ace Attorney, I'd probably dislike him. Edgeworth on the other hand is really smart and antagonistic, I really like his first appearance in the case, I like the updated autopsy report he pulls up and I love the smart arguments he makes during the part where you have to deal with April Mays testimony, I kinda wish we got to see Edgeworth be more antagonistic, like if there was more cases in the first game and we got to see him more times as a rival, he definitely feels like an antagonist in this case and I love the reveal that he told the Bellboy to withhold information about the other hotel guest who was staying in the room with April May just because he wants that guilty verdict and he can't get that if there is another suspect outside of the defendant.

April May is good to, exposing her in the courtroom that she wiretapped the victims phone and that's how she knew the statue was a clock is so much more satisfying than exposing Frank Sahwit as the culprit in the First Turnabout, she has way more personality than Frank and she is way more interesting, being this sexy pink haired girl with big boobs who flirts with every guy and acting all cutesy until she absolutely loses it in the courtroom and shows her true colours. I know Frank lost it too but with April it was just way more funnier and satisfying to me, I don't really know why. Also the Bellboy was definitely looking at her tit's when serving her the overly priced ice coffee but did he really need to bring in the whole tea set into court?

1jpugt6,https://i.redd.it/g4iq8lerigse1.jpeg,Squatch Originals Bundle Review,"I won’t mention lather as they all have the same great lather. Points all around. I like strong grit so I’ll acknowledge the bars that have it but most of these are zero grit.


From Worst to Best:


- Spearmint Basil 1/10

I’d rather use this than no soap but I’d use an odourless soap over this. When I opened the Bundle Package, this bar was the only one I could smell. The scent is ridiculously overpowering to where it gave me headaches in the shower. It’s like a very strong toothpaste smell. I couldn’t wait to be done with it. I’d love my breath to smell like this; not my body. 


- Grapefruit IPA 2/10 

I’m not the biggest grapefruit fan but I totally get it. It’s a sweet fruity smell with a heavy citrus scent. Again, another bar I couldn’t wait to be done with but I’m willing to accept I’m in the minority here. 


- Cold Brew Cleanse 2/10

Ridiculously disappointing. By far the weakest scent, could only smell the brown sugar bar to nose, it’s a generic, odourless smell otherwise. Not even a hint of coffee. Still does the job though, the grit level is amazing. It’s like my skin was being scrubbed with chia seeds lol. The scent is just way too weak. Was really looking forward to this one. 


- Alpine Sage 3/10 

One of the weaker scents, not too remarkable, but the smell is pleasant and calming. Just too boring and weak. 


- Cool Fresh Aloe 3/10

Slightly better than Alpine Sage, only because the smell of Aloe is iconic and nice, very ‘health’ reminiscent. The white and green pattern on the bar also looks cool. 


- Fresh Falls 4/10 

Probably the most over rated Squatch bar. I can’t exactly describe the smell, it’s a mostly nice but weak cologne type smell that also gets boring fast. I don’t see the hype. The blue bar looks nice but like many others mine started to turn into a weird pinkish grey on one side before I used it. It’s very average. 


- Birchwood Breeze 4/10 

This one is weird. It’s a nice nature-ish smell that’s also sweet. A bit too light though, definitely one of the weaker bars. The grit level was medium but slightly uncomfortable, it’s like tiny sand particles in the soap bar that scratched my skin, felt like thin sand paper. I like grit but this one was not it. The scent is at least pleasant though.


- Gold Moss 5/10 

Gold Moss smells like Attar or Arabic Perfumes like Oud. It’s one the better briccs that fills your bathroom with the scent, but it gets a bit tiring. The smell itself isn’t too strong but the nature of the scent, it’s just something I don’t want to use everyday, just occasionally. 


- Bay Rum 6/10 

I liked this Soap a lot at the beginning but as I went through it, the scent got really weak. When there was about 30% of the bar left it was demoted to hand wash. But the initial scent is great, slightly on the weaker side but the smell of spices works great with the Squatch base soap scent. A very nice smell. 


- Coconut Castaway 9/10 

My current bar. To be honest I wouldn’t buy any of the previous soaps again. The rest, like Castaway are just miles better. This soap smells like fresh, sweet coconut and just reminds you of a beach. The scent is amazing and the texture of the bar is unique, it doesn’t feel plastic like all the others, it feels more like hard clay. Hard to explain. I feel as though this is a common favourite. Can’t go wrong with it. It’s genuinely amazing. 

- Pine Tar 10/10 

This is my personal favourite. I think this bar isn’t as approved as much as Castaway but it’s still a fan favourite and for good reason. The scent is just so good. I’m not sure how an earthy, muddy scent could be made to be so nice but this is it. It smells like cloudy rain in a forest at 1pm. The grit is the best, the hard oat bits really dig in but not enough to hurt. 

There is a common down side people bring up with how it ‘stains’ the shower with its dark lather. For me, while it does leave it around my shower, like all other soap, I just grab my shower head afterwards and quickly rinse down the shower, and it’s clean in 10 seconds. I can see how it might be a problem with those with fixed shower heads. Still though, this is the best bar I’ve ever used. 

Currently only Coconut Castaway and Pine Tar are the ones I’d buy again. 

I also have Wood Barrel Bourbon that I’ll be using next and from the scent alone I think it’s going to be on par with the last two. ",2,1743615056.0,DrSquatch,0,1.0,False

I also enjoy doing my makeup and tweaking my skincare routine, and self care (does this count as a hobby lol?) I love going for walks with my music blasting, and hiking when I have the time, love me some cute coffee dates and I do game sometimes on my switch.

I’m a computer science grad currently trying to get into a masters programme. I love academia and doing research and want to get a PhD after my masters. I’ll probably be getting my masters in the UK where I did my undergrad, so I’d prefer you to be in Europe as well, as that makes meeting much easier.

My personality is very nerdy, and combined with my ADHD you can always find me researching something new, which means I’ll have a lot of stuff to talk about. My current obsession is deep sea animals, and I’m a bigfin squid fan. I have a silly and sometimes dark sense of humour and watching cringey stuff on YouTube is my guilty pleasure. 

My main interests are gaming, photography, astronomy, cooking, baking and coffee. I’ll happily send you pictures of things I bake or nice cups of espresso. Speaking of pictures, the title isn’t clickbait, my parents have a lot of cats so you’ll be receiving a lot of cat pictures.

1jpucus,https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1jpucus/selfhosted_aiostreams_timeout_issues_configuration/,Self-Hosted AIOStreams Timeout Issues & Configuration,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out for some help with my self-hosted Stremio setup. I've been following Viren's (u/viren\_7) excellent guides to set up self-hosted AIOStreams and related services, and I've learned a ton about Docker, networking, and server management in the process! Big thanks to Viren for those amazing resources, go buy them a coffee if the guides helped you too: [https://ko-fi.com/viren070](https://ko-fi.com/viren070)

My setup includes:

* A VPS on Oracle Cloud
* Docker Compose (using Viren's template)
* Cloudflare for DNS
* Real Debrid and MediaFlow Proxy for IP restriction bypass
* Warp for Cloudflare blocking
* A range of self-hosted services (see services below)

Here's the list of my services (from Dash):

* AIOStreams
* Dash
* Dozzle
* Honey
* Comet
* Jackett
* Jackettio
* MediaFlow
* MediaFusion
* OmgTV
* Stremio Server
*  StremThru
* TMDB
* Trakt

**Issue 1: Timeout Problems**

My main problem is that I'm consistently experiencing timeout issues, especially with Jackettio and MediaFusion. Comet too but I saw people said that usually slows things down, even after commenting out Comet in my `docker-compose.yml` file to rule it out as a resource hog, the timeouts persist.

* Refreshing the page *sometimes* loads the streams, but it's unreliable.
* Automatic playback of the next episode in a series frequently fails due to timeouts.
* Changing timeout settings just seems to make me wait longer for the eventual timeout.
* Cached streams play fine, so it's not a general streaming or proxy issue. The problem seems to be with the initial searching/catalog loading.

I've checked my AIOStreams configuration:

    AIOSTREAMS_COMET_URL=http://comet:2020/
    AIOSTREAMS_FORCE_COMET_HOSTNAME=<REDACTED>  // Removed hostname for privacy
    AIOSTREAMS_COMET_INDEXERS=[""1337x"", ""thepiratebay"", ""therarbg"", ""badasstorrents""]
    AIOSTREAMS_MEDIAFUSION_URL=http://mediafusion:8000/
    AIOSTREAMS_JACKETTIO_URL=http://jackettio:4000/
    AIOSTREAMS_JACKETT_INDEXERS=[""1337x"", ""thepiratebay"", ""therarbg"", ""badasstorrents""]
    AIOSTREAMS_JACKETT_API_KEY=${JACKETT_API_KEY:-}
    

Could my indexer settings be too aggressive? Is there some other configuration I'm missing? Most people say their self-hosted setups are incredibly smooth, but mine is consistently slow.

**Issue 2: Configuration Workflow Confusion**

My second area of confusion is the overall configuration workflow. Viren's guides are great for getting things self-hosted, but they don't cover the application-specific configuration *after* the services are running.

* I can access the web interfaces of all my services (AIOStreams, Comet, Mediafusion, etc.) through my Honey start page.
* Do I need to configure these services individually in their web interfaces *and then* add them to Stremio via manifest URLs?
* Or does the `.env` file configuration handle most of it, and I only need to configure AIOStreams?

For example, the RAVENN Trakt addon required me to go to its web interface to connect my Trakt account and configure the catalogs before adding it to Stremio. Do I need to do the same for MediaFusion and Jackettio? And if so, how does that interact with AIOStreams?

* When I add AIOStreams to Stremio, I only see search results from Cinemeta. How do I get search results from MediaFusion and Jackettio to show up? I would like to take advantage of some of the live options MediaFusion has but I can't if there is no way to search for them.\\
* I have an IPTV provider so I was going to add that to OMG TV once everything else was running correctly for my live sports, Formula 1 and UFC etc.

I'm feeling a bit lost in the configuration maze, and any guidance would be greatly appreciated! I'd rather not bother Viren directly since they already provided so much help. Thanks in advance!

He really liked it, but one day he randomly just stopped. About two weeks ago he confessed there was a barista there that he found attractive, describing her to me. He said he never talked to her more than a “hi how are you” because he always did pick up orders. But he emphasized that he felt like he HAD to stop going because he was too attracted to her. He’d notice when she was gone or I guess even be excited to see her.

Look, we live in a city. There are lots of hot 20-somethings walking around, men and women. I know it’s normal to find other people attractive, but I’ve never had to physically restrain myself from entering an establishment because someone working there was.. i guess that irresistible?

I’ve been sad about it ever since he told me. It’s like, I appreciate him removing himself from the situation. But I worry that that urge was too strong and not normal? Like, different than just seeing someone attractive outside. 

Anyways, he goes to a different shop now, and last night he made the joke, “you don’t have to worry about hot baristas anymore!” and I started crying my eyes out. It really hurt my feelings. I cried myself to sleep and I cried this morning getting ready for work.

I’ve become obsessed with it all over again and worse than before. I want to see who she is. I asked him, what’s so hot about her? Is she hotter than me? And instead of saying no, he was like “i want to be with you, it’s whatever!” so i think he finds her physically more attractive too.

I know there can always be someone hotter, but man this broke my heart. I don’t know what to do. Even if I see an attractive guy, I’m not foaming at the mouth over them excited to see them or sad if they’re gone. I don’t know. I’m just a wreck.

That is just not right. Tea doesn’t require you to add in a whole bunch of junk like milk, sugar, creamer, etc to make it taste good. Tea’s natural taste far outperforms coffee.

Tea is also much more versatile. All coffee pretty much tastes the same. Tea does not. Green and black tea taste different. Oolong and white tea taste different. There are more flavoring options to tea as well like jasmine, orange, peach, etc.

Tea is also able to grow in more places than coffee. The US for example has vast expanses of land that can grow tea and doesn’t because its foolish populace prefers coffee to tea even though tea is better.

Tea also has much more prestige to it than coffee. There are whole tea ceremonies and rituals in China and Japan for tea. Nowhere does that for coffee. But don’t bring up the British. Their tea is disgusting. Earl grey is nasty and they add in milk and sugar to their tea. It is just awful.

So today I decided to make the effort to go out on a day hike and stop off at a café halfway around. 

The first half of the walk was going great and I could already feel myself feeling a bit better. I hadn't run into too many people as most of the trails were pretty remote and quiet, especially at midday on a weekday, which is always a plus.

I arrived at the café to get a coffee and sandwich and read my book for a while and rest my legs. I ordered my food and while taking my order the lady behind the counter asked me ""Will you be eating inside or outside?"", to which I replied outside. This will be important later. I then waited to the side at the front counter so the people behind me could order. I stood there for a while, just scrolling on my phone when the woman at the counter hands me a little metal holder containing a wooden spoon with a number written on it and some cutlery and said the following: ""You can take this"" or something fairly vague along those lines. I took this to mean, in essence, ""You can take this to your table outside so we can see where you're sat and bring your order to you. Now please go away so I can serve the other customers"". So I took the spoon and wandered outside to get a seat, put the container with the spoon on the table and started reading my book while I waited.

A little while later the woman came over to my table and said ""Were you the one who ordered the [my drink order]?"". I told her yes and she then said ""Okay. Just in future, if you can wait to get your drink from the counter"". I was a little confused, since again she had given me the spoon container and made it seem as though she wanted me to go away and take it to my table. If she didn't want me to go yet, why tell me to take the spoon? Why not wait until my drink was ready and then tell me to take the spoon? Anyway, I apologised to her and she left and I went back to reading my book.

A little while later again a different woman came out holding my plate of food. A pair of other women who were sat across from me, who apparently knew the woman bringing my food, said hello to her, to which she responded something along the lines of: ""Sorry, I just have to bring this man who isn't listening his food"" before rudely dropping my plate onto the table without another word. I, somewhat stunned and very confused, simply said nothing while she walked off to talk with her friends. Presumably she had been shouting my order number inside the café and because I was sat outside I hadn't heard her.

What I don't understand is that the first lady had asked me whether I was eating inside or outside. Why would she bother to ask me that if they were just going to shout my order number inside anyway instead of bring it to the table? Furthermore, when the first woman brought out my drink then why did she not also say that I would need to come inside to get my food? The way she phrased it made it seem that I should have waited for my drink and then they would have brought out my food for me. But if that was the case, why was the second lady angry at me for not being inside to hear and collect my order? And if they were never intending to bring my food to my table, then what on earth was ever the point of the numbered spoon?

I feel like all of this could have been avoided if the first lady had just waited until my order was ready before telling me to take the spoon, or really to just do away with the spoon entirely. The utter illogicality of the entire thing and their audacity to get angry and rude with me for literally just doing what I was told with the information I was given left me in a bad mood for the rest of the walk. I just hate it when NTs expect people to just know how these situations work and what they're expected to do and get angry with them when they don't follow their illogical, unclear, and frankly stupid rules. 

Anyway, I just needed to rant about this whole situation. I know I shouldn't let it bug me as much as it is, but to me its part of a larger lack of empathy and understanding towards neurodiverse people.

E-bikes are dope—zooming past traffic, crushing hills without wheezing, and sticking it to Big Oil. But those $5K+ models? Yeah, I’m not selling my kidney for that. Good news: you can snag a solid e-bike without breaking the bank. I’ve scoured the web, read reviews from people who actually ride these things, and found the best budget e-bikes under $2,000. No fluff, just the good stuff. Let’s roll.

# How I Picked These (No BS)

I looked at motor power (gotta have some oomph), battery range (no one wants to push a dead bike home), build quality (cheap doesn’t mean falling apart), and what real riders say. Price cap: $2K. Bonus points for cool features or brands that don’t ghost you on warranties. Here’s the lineup.

# 1. Ride1Up 700 Series – The “Does Everything” King

* **Price:** $1,595
* **Vibe:** The overachiever you secretly admire.
* **Specs:** 750W motor, 48V battery (50-ish miles), 28 mph top speed
* **Who It’s For:** Commuters who hate cars, casual riders who hate sweat

This thing’s a beast. 750W motor? Check. 50-mile range? Check. Suspension and hydraulic brakes so you don’t eat pavement? Check. It’s got a rack for your groceries and a fancy LCD to flex your speed. For $1,595, it’s basically stealing from Ride1Up. Assembly’s a pain if you’re allergic to tools, but once it’s rolling, you’re golden.

**Pros:** Power, range, looks cool  
  
**Cons:** IKEA-level setup

# 2. Lectric XP 3.0 – The $999 Folding Legend

* **Price:** $999
* **Vibe:** The budget GOAT that folds like origami.
* **Specs:** 500W motor (1,000W peak), 48V battery (45 miles), 20 mph
* **Who It’s For:** Apartment peeps, van-lifers, anyone with no space

$999 gets you fat tires, a rack, fenders, and a headlight—stuff other brands charge extra for. The 500W motor (peaks at 1K) laughs at hills, and it folds in half when your landlord’s like “no bikes inside.” 45 miles of range is clutch, but at 64 lbs, it’s not winning any featherweight awards. Still, for a grand? Take my money.

**Pros:** Cheap af, loaded with extras, portable  
  
**Cons:** Heavy as hell

# 3. Aventon Pace 350 – The Chill Cruiser

* **Price:** $1,199
* **Vibe:** Your laid-back friend who’s secretly fit.
* **Specs:** 350W motor, 36V battery (40 miles), 20 mph
* **Who It’s For:** Sunday riders, short-trip warriors

This one’s for vibing, not grinding. 350W keeps it smooth up to 20 mph, and 40 miles is plenty for coffee runs or park laps. At 46 lbs, you can actually carry it upstairs without crying. Sleek design, five assist levels, and a little display—simple but effective. Don’t expect it to climb Everest, though.

**Pros:** Light, easy to ride, aesthetic  
  
**Cons:** Wimpy on steep stuff

# 4. Rad Power Bikes RadRunner 1 – The Errand Tank

* **Price:** $1,399
* **Vibe:** The pickup truck of e-bikes.
* **Specs:** 750W motor, 48V battery (45 miles), 20 mph
* **Who It’s For:** Costco haulers, gear junkies

Need to carry a week’s groceries or your dog? RadRunner’s got you. 750W motor, 300-lb payload, and fat tires that eat potholes for breakfast. It’s single-speed (lazy but low maintenance), and you can trick it out with racks or seats (extra $$, of course). 45 miles of range keeps it practical. Not a speed demon, but it’s a tank.

**Pros:** Hauls everything, tough as nails  
  
**Cons:** One gear, meh speed

# 5. Juiced Bikes CrossCurrent X – The Speed Freak

* **Price:** $1,999
* **Vibe:** The “budget” flex for adrenaline junkies.
* **Specs:** 750W motor, 52V battery (65 miles), 28 mph
* **Who It’s For:** Long-haul commuters, wannabe racers

$1,999 is stretching “budget,” but hear me out: 65 miles of range, 28 mph top speed, and a torque sensor that makes it feel pro. This thing’s a rocket with hydraulic brakes to save your ass. It’s 60 lbs, so don’t plan on lugging it far, but for long rides or flexing on your friends, it’s unreal.

**Pros:** Insane range, fast af, premium vibes  
  
**Cons:** Pricey, chunky

# TL;DR

E-bikes don’t have to cost your rent. These five—$999 to $1,999—get you solid motors, decent range, and no “I regret this” vibes. Ride1Up for all-rounders, Lectric for cheapskates, Aventon for chillers, Rad for haulers, Juiced for speed. Pick one, charge it, and tell cars to eat your dust. Thoughts?

So I bought a new keyboard a few weeks ago and the colour scheme I went for was a ""coffee"" look, if that makes any sense.  
Cream, dark and light brown, some gold ect.  
My old board consisted of vibrant colours so my mousepads matched that same look. 

  
All bright and vibrant, which wont really work with this new look.  
Every mousepad I've found so far has been god awful so I've come here to see if anybody would know of a pad that would match the aesthetic that I'm going for.

I honestly don't mind art and things of that nature but I just really prefer if the art is minimal. For reference, my favourite pad is the ""relaxed cat"" from inked gaming.

would appreciate if if anyone has something in mind :)

Chapter 1: Wolfless Luna

Thea's POV

My hands won't stop shaking as I stare at the divorce papers on my lap. I still can't believe this is happening. The Ashworth Pack mansion looms before me like a prison I'm finally escaping from. Seven years of memories, none of them particularly good, and now it's all coming down to this moment.

I grip the steering wheel harder, trying to steady myself. One signature. That's all it'll take to make me the first Luna in Pack history to be divorced and kicked out. How's that for a legacy? My throat tightens at the thought of facing Sebastian again. God, even after everything, just thinking his name still hurts.

The security system beeps as it recognizes my car - a bitter reminder that I technically still belong here. For now. The gardens I never managed to make my own stretch out before me as I walk the familiar path to the door. Every step feels heavy with the weight of failure. Seven years of trying to belong, of loving a man who saw me as nothing more than a convenient placeholder.

I reach for the door handle but freeze as voices drift out from the kitchen. I might not have supernatural hearing, but these mansion walls are thinner than they look.

""Daddy, why can't you live with me and mommy anymore?"" Leo's innocent question hits me like a punch to the gut.

I should walk away. Should just barge in and get this shit over with. But my feet won't move. My body betrays me, forcing me to stand here and listen to my son's heart break along with mine.

""Pack needs a real Luna, Leo."" Sebastian's deep voice still affects me, damn him. ""Your mom... she doesn't have a wolf. She can't understand what we need.""

Same old story. Different day. I press my hand against my chest, trying to push back the familiar ache. How many times have I heard this? That I'm not enough, will never be enough, all because I was born without a wolf? The universe's cosmic joke - a wolfless daughter in an alpha bloodline.

""But didn't you say wolves can choose their mates?"" My smart boy, always asking the hard questions. ""Doesn't your wolf like Mommy?""

The silence that follows is deafening. I can picture Sebastian's face - that cold, dismissive look I've gotten used to. The same expression he wore when he told me he couldn't mark me as his mate. Of course he couldn't - I've always known his heart belonged to someone else, just like I've always known I could never be his true mate. How could I be, when I don't even have a wolf to answer his?

""Your mother gave me you,"" he finally says, his voice distant. ""That's what matters.""

Right. Because that's all I'm good for, isn't it? A means to produce the next alpha heir. Never mind that I gave him everything - my love, my loyalty, my whole life. But of course it wasn't enough. Not when SHE's shadow has always loomed between us.

I take a deep breath and push open the door. The kitchen falls silent. Sebastian stands by the counter, and fuck me if he doesn't still look like every woman's dream in his pretty suit. Those green eyes turn to ice as they land on me, his jaw clenching in that way that means he's pissed.

""Mommy!"" Leo's face lights up, and my heart squeezes painfully. He looks so much like his father - same striking features, same captivating green eyes. My beautiful boy, the only pure thing to come from this mess of a marriage.

""Leo, go upstairs."" Sebastian's Alpha command fills the room.

""But Dad-""

""Now.""

I watch my son trudge away, feeling as insignificant as I did that first day I entered this house. The divorce papers crinkle in my tight grip as I try to find my voice.

""I brought the final papers,"" I manage, hating how weak I sound.

""You really want to do this?"" His voice could freeze hell over. ""To destroy our family?""

I rub my chest, trying to ease the constant ache there. ""Sebastian, please... we both know this marriage was never real. You never-"" I can't finish. Never loved me. Never wanted me. Never chose me.

""You could have sent these to my office,"" he snaps, anger rolling off him in waves. ""Instead of interrupting my time with Leo.""

""I thought..."" I stop, realizing how pathetic I sound. What did I think? That after seven years of rejection, something would magically change?

""You never think, do you?"" Each word is a precise cut. ""Every time you show up here, you bring chaos with you. From day one, all you've done is disrupt Pack harmony because you can't accept what you are - what you aren't."" He takes a deep breath, trying to control his anger. ""Just leave the papers. I'll have someone drop Leo off later.""

I set the papers down with trembling hands, feeling like I'm drowning in air. I want to defend myself, maybe apologize one last time for not being what he needed. But what's the point? Seven years of explaining myself, of begging him to see me as more than just a wolfless burden...

My phone's sudden ring cuts through my spiral of self-pity. My mother's name on the screen makes my blood run cold. In the Sterling family, no one contacts the wolfless disappointment unless something's gone terribly wrong.

My hands shake as I answer. ""Hello?""

""Thea!"" My mother's voice is thick with panic. ""Your father... he was attacked by Rogues! He's losing too much blood... Get to the hospital. Now!""

The phone slips from my numb fingers, clattering against the floor. The sound echoes through the suddenly silent kitchen.

""Thea?"" Sebastian's voice loses its edge. ""What's wrong?""

I look up at him, the world tilting sideways. 

""My father... Rogues attacked him. He's in the hospital.""

Chapter 2: The Outsider

Thea's POV

""I need to go,"" I said, the words tumbling out. ""Can you watch Leo?""

Sebastian said something, his words taking too long to reach my scattered thoughts. Everything felt distant, like I was underwater. Finally, his voice broke through: ""...want me to watch him now?""

""Please.""I couldn't meet his eyes, couldn't handle whatever judgment I might find there. ""Just... I can't take him to the hospital. Not for this.""

There was a pause, perhaps concern, confusion, or annoyance, but honestly, I didn't give a damn. My brain was already halfway to the hospital.

""I'll have my mother watch him,"" he said, his tone carrying an unfamiliar softness that any other day might have meant something.

""Thank you."" I turned to leave, then stopped. ""Tell him... tell him I love him? And that I'll be back soon?""

""Of course."" 

The drive to Moon Bay General felt endless. Streetlights blurred past as memories flooded my mind—growing up in the Sterling Pack, always the outsider, the family’s greatest mistake. The wolfless daughter who brought shame to our bloodline.

I remembered the last time I'd driven this route - the night Leo was born. The only time my father had ever looked at me with something close to pride.

""You can't come to the ceremony,"" Mom would say at every pack gathering, her voice perfectly polite. ""You understand, don't you dear? It wouldn't be... appropriate.""

Roman had tried, at first. My big brother, the future Alpha, sneaking me chocolate after particularly bad days. ""They'll come around,"" he'd say. ""Just give them time.""

But they never did. And eventually, even Roman's kindness faded to nothing more than awkward glances across dinner tables.

Then there was Aurora. Perfect, beautiful Aurora and her perfect fucking life. Every pack member's dream daughter, while I was the nightmare they tried to hide away. The ghost in the family photos, the name they never mentioned in public.

All of it hurt like hell, but I could’ve lived with it. I’d lived with it my whole life. Until seven years ago, when everything went to shit. Aurora swore she never wanted to see me again after what happened. My own sister, looking at me like I was worse than nothing. After that, even Sebastian and the Ashworth Pack rejected me. Only Leo - my lovely Leo - still looked at me like I mattered.

The hospital parking lot was nearly empty this late. I pulled into a spot, but couldn't make myself get out immediately. What was I even doing here? The man dying in that building had spent my entire life making it clear I wasn't really his daughter. Why should his crisis move me?

But I was here. Because despite everything, he was my father. Because some stupid, broken part of me still cared.

The emergency room reeked of antiseptic and fear. ""Derek Sterling,"" I told the receptionist. ""He was brought in with... with injuries from a Rogue attack.""

Her eyes widened slightly at the name. Of course - everyone knew the Sterling Pack Alpha. ""He's in emergency surgery. Family waiting room is down that hall.""

I found my mother and Roman in the waiting room. Mom's blouse was soaked with blood - Dad's blood - and her mascara had left black trails down her cheeks. Roman stood beside her, one hand on her shoulder, trying to project calm even though I could smell the anxiety rolling off him in waves.

""What happened?"" I asked, keeping my distance.

Roman looked up, his expression tightening when he saw me. ""Rogues ambushed him on his way home. Multiple attackers. They... they nearly tore him apart."" His voice cracked. ""The Alpha healing isn't working. They think there might have been poison.""

Mom let out a choked sob. I took an instinctive step toward her, then stopped myself. We both knew she didn't want comfort from me.

""He's in surgery now,"" Roman continued. ""They're doing everything they can.""

I nodded, throat tight. What could I say? Sorry the father who never wanted me might be dying? Sorry I came even though we all wish I hadn't?

The doors swung open and they wheeled Dad past us toward the operating room. Mom and Roman rushed to his side immediately. I hung back, watching. He looked small somehow, pale and broken on the gurney. This man who had always seemed larger than life, who had ruled our pack with absolute authority, now fighting for each breath.

""Alpha Sterling,"" Mom whispered, clutching his hand. ""My love, please fight.""

Roman's eyes glowed gold as his wolf pushed forward. ""Father, stay with us. The pack needs you.""

I stood silent, an outsider watching a family moment I had no part in. Dad's hand move slightly, passing something to Mom before they wheeled him away. The medical team rushed him through the operating room doors, leaving us in a heavy silence broken only by her quiet sobs.

The waiting was endless. I paced, unable to sit still, while memories crashed over me again like waves. Dad teaching Aurora to shift while I watched from my bedroom window. Mom braiding Aurora's hair before pack ceremonies while telling me to stay in my room so I wouldn't embarrass them. The day I turned sixteen and still hadn't a wolf, the shame in Dad's eyes when he announced to the pack that his youngest daughter was wolfless.

Roman made coffee runs. Mom prayed to the Moon Goddess. I walked circles in the waiting room and tried not to think about how fucking unfair it all was - that even now, even here, I still felt like I didn't belong.

Two and a half hours passed before the doctor emerged, his expression grave. ""Mrs. Sterling? I'm so sorry. We did everything we could, but your husband's heart stopped. We couldn't bring him back.""

Mom's howl of grief shook the walls. Roman caught her as her knees buckled, his own eyes bright with tears. The sound pierced through me, primal and raw - the cry of a wolf who'd lost her mate. A sound I would never be able to make.

I pressed my hand to my chest, trying to contain the strange hollow ache there. My father was dead. The man who had never accepted me, never loved me, was gone. I should feel something. Grief or relief or... anything. Instead, I felt numb.

Then a terrible thought hit me like a physical blow. Dad's death meant more than just a new Alpha for the Sterling Pack. 

It meant Aurora would have to come home.

Chapter 3: She's Back

Thea's POV

I sat rigid in the hard plastic chair, the scent of grief and antiseptic burning my nose. Mom's sobs had quieted to occasional whimpers, but her pain still filled the waiting room like a physical presence. My throat tightened. 

The image of Dad's mangled body haunted me. His throat had been torn open, dried blood caking the savage wounds that even his Alpha healing couldn't repair. The mighty Alpha Sterling, reduced to bloody scraps by those Rogue bastards. I'd never seen him look weak before - not once in my life. And now here he was, destroyed by the very creatures he'd spent his life fighting.

""Here.""

I jumped at Sebastian's voice. He had arrived about an hour ago after hearing the news, and now he was standing next to my chair, holding out a paper cup of coffee. Why was he being... nice?

""Thanks,"" I muttered, taking the cup. The warmth seeped into my cold fingers. Sebastian sat down beside me, his familiar scent - sandalwood and rain - - wrapping around me immeditely. Every time I caught his scent, it just reminded me of all the nights I'd lain awake wondering why I wasn't enough.

""Are you okay?"" he asked softly.

I almost laughed. Seven years of marriage, and now he asks? ""I'm fine.""

""Thea-""

""Don't."" I cut him off. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

He stiffened beside me, that familiar wall slamming back into place between us. Good. This, at least, was familiar territory.

""Mom already called Aurora."" Roman's voice cut through the tension. ""She's on her way.""

I watched Sebastian's reaction from the corner of my eye. His whole body tensed, jaw clenching as he sucked in a sharp breath. I bet his wolf stirred just beneath the surface. My chest ached. Seven years, and he still acted like a lovesick puppy at the mere mention of my sister.

""She doesn't know about Dad yet,"" Roman continued. ""Mom thought it would be better to tell her in person.""

Of course. Aurora deserved the gentle approach. Heaven forbid anyone upset the golden daughter.

""Thea."" Mom's voice was sharp. ""I expect you to be civil when your sister arrives.""

The coffee turned bitter in my mouth. ""Civil? Like you've all been to me?""

""This isn't about you."" Her eyes flashed. ""Your father is dead, and you're still being selfish. Just like seven years ago-""

""Don't."" My voice shook. ""Don't you dare bring that up now.""

""Why not? Nothing's changed. You're still the same selfish girl who-""

""I was protecting my family!"" The words burst out before I could stop them. ""But you never even asked my side, did you? None of you did. You just assumed the worst because I'm wolfless. Because I've never been good enough for this fucking family!""

""Thea,"" Sebastian growled, his Alpha authority seeping into his voice.

""No!"" I stood up, hands shaking. ""I'm not your Luna anymore, Sebastian. You don't get to command me."" I turned back to my mother. ""And you - did you ever stop to think that maybe I'm your daughter too? That maybe I'm grieving too?""

Mom's face hardened. ""A real daughter wouldn't-""

""A real mother would love her child regardless!"" The words echoed in the quiet waiting room. ""But I guess I stopped being your child the day I was born without a wolf, right?""

I couldn't breathe. Couldn't stand there and look at their faces - Sebastian's cold disapproval, Roman's discomfort, Mom's bitter disappointment. I turned and walked away, needing air, needing space, needing to be anywhere but here.

The hospital's back entrance opened onto a small garden. The night air was cool against my hot face. I leaned against the wall, trying to steady my breathing. Why had I come? What was I hoping to find here? Some magical last-minute reconciliation? My father's deathbed acceptance?

""Ms. Sterling?"" A nurse stood in the doorway. ""We need you to... to identify the body.""

My legs felt like lead as I followed her to the morgue. The body on the metal table was barely recognizable as my father. The sheet couldn't hide the extent of the damage - the unnatural angles where bones had been shattered, the bulk of bandages hiding the worst of the attack. 

The nurse pulled back the sheet and I saw his face.

He looked peaceful. More peaceful than he'd ever looked at me in life. I reached out, hesitated, then touched his cold hand.

""I'm sorry, Daddy,"" I whispered. ""I'm sorry I couldn't be what you wanted. I'm sorry I couldn't be her.""

The words stuck in my throat. What was I apologizing for? Being born? Surviving? Trying to protect my family, even when they'd never protected me?

""Goodbye,"" I said finally. Not just to him, but to all of it - the hope of acceptance, the dream of belonging. It was time to let go.

When I returned to the waiting room, Mom was rushing around making calls while Roman sat alone, looking lost. Sebastian had disappeared somewhere. Then the automatic doors slid open, and I saw her.

Aurora.

She swept in, her golden hair falling in perfect waves. Even at 3 AM, she looked like she'd just stepped off a magazine cover.

""'I came as soon as I could,"" Aurora's voice trembled perfectly and I saw tears glitter in her eyes. ""Where's Daddy?""

Sebastian materialized out of nowhere, appearing at her side so fast you'd think he'd teleported. I watched him embrace her immediately, and the truth hit me like a punch to the gut—

After all these years, Sebastian's love for Aurora had never disappeared. Not even a little bit.

 Let’s make random conversations and get to know each other. Maybe we can be a good match. Exchange thoughts bout our interests. Send cute, interesting and scenic photos to each other! 
we can also play online games like LoL or Valo habang nakatambay sa discord. 

Bout me:

 5’8 with a lean fit body, INTJ personality, musically inclined (i listened to a lot of genres based on my mood. I also love old songs), im into arts, non-smoker but drinks alcohol, i only drink coffee when driving long distances. Im into cooking, working out, watching movies and series, roadtrips, nature and beach trips.

If you’re still reading, i hope you are someone who is kind, smart, and driven. A pet lover. Someone who will appreciate my sense of humor and has a hearty laugh.  adventurous. If you read and watched the whole one piece series, that would be a plus. If youre willing
to watch it with me again, a bigger plus. Same taste in music would be nice, 21 years old and above. And lastly, same body type as me. Im not into meet ups for now.

He got me thinking, when they said you’re not supposed to eat cantaloupe, “Oh, this would be great for me! I’m allergic to cantaloupe!” But then I realized how stupid that is, because most people are not allergic to cantaloupe! 

What would your life-changing diet for everyone be?

Mine:

1. eat lots of blueberries (because “antioxidants” I guess)
2. Eat grass fed beef (because I am a farmer and have a lot of it, but I am going to make everyone eat it now)
3. Avoid avocados, cantaloupe, and bananas, because they will kill you. (I mean, they’re bad for me (Allergic), so if course they are bad for you, right?)
4. Drink lattes because, um, it stimulates the nervous system? (I like lattes)
5. Have an afternoon snack of toast to, like, “balance your humors”
6. Only cook food in the slow cooker… I haven’t thought of a health related reason for this. I’m sure I can make one up before publishing my book. 

I’m going to call it the “Midwest is Best” diet and I am going to try to get Oprah to endorse it!

1jptk59,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jptk59,Would you like to have a cup of church coffee in Chongqing?,"At the top of the Mountain City Walkway, there is a place called Ren'ai Hall, which I highly recommend you visit. In 1891, Chongqing was opened to foreign trade, and in 1900, the French began constructing Ren'ai Hall, which combined a church and a hospital. Ren'ai Hall resembles a medieval European castle, retaining the classical Latin cross layout and built with a brick-and-wood structure. Today, Ren'ai Hall is half in ruins and half preserved as a historical site. Its unique style and rich history attract many visitors, and it has even hosted various cultural and artistic activities, creating a unique romantic atmosphere in the mountain city. 

And guess what? Inside the chapel, there is a café ☕️ that is decorated in a retro and charming style!

The entire building has a very retro feel, and the interior decoration is full of character, giving off an old Hong Kong vibe. There's also a magical one-way glass inside: you can see outside, but people outside can't see in! They offer specialty coffee, including their own unique blend of beans, and they also sell craft beer.

I highly recommend taking a walk on the mountain city trails and then enjoying a coffee with a view of the cityscape from the mountaintop🌆

1jptgf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/eastvillage/comments/1jptgf6/787_coffee_are_bad_people/,787 coffee are bad people,"Making this post to tell you about a particularly unethical coffee chain that has numerous locations in new york. Mainly in the East Village but some in Brooklyn too. Maybe you've even bought an overpriced coquito latte or marzipan latte from them before. 787 coffee. On the outside they seem like they're friendly folks interested in helping communities. They have an aggressive customer facing policy meant to influence the opinions of consumers, painting themselves as an 'ethical'  'people first' sort of brand. They even have a slogan that's something to the effect of 'we're not a coffee company but a human company'. They would tell me to thank customers for supporting a small business. I didn't do that. But this company has like 15 locations or something in manhattan. The owner Brandon Ivan Peña has shit written up about him in Forbes. This will look more and more insane as you continue reading. 

I worked for this shop for a couple years. They quite literally did not care if I, or my coworkers lived or died. A coworker of mine was borderline sexually assaulted by a random guy who walked in, spat on, and one of the upper management people came in to check things out. My coworker was never even asked if she was alright. The focus was on the customers and the state of the shop. I personally had a heavy sidewalk hatch door fall on my back while hauling crates of milk up from basement storage. Why did this happen? Because it was missing a safety bar designed to prevent this from happening. Myself and others had been asking them to replace the part for months to no avail. Fortunately I was OK. They actively told me to stop asking customers to mask peak covid because they thought it was alienating to customers. I was lied to over and over about being exposed to covid. They had rats. No soap in the employee only bathroom. Horrible sanitation on the part of the management. 

Anyway, I found out they were stealing the digital tip money from myself and many other baristas. One guy had something like 50K stolen from him over the course of a couple years. Basically they were diverting funds from the digital tips on the POS system which are supposed to be distributed amongst tipped employees across the company.  Instead of doing this they were using this money to pay the base wages of farm workers in Puerto Rico, where they own and operate their own coffee bean farm. I'll add this is especially annoying because I was coached to tell customers that 'we contribute to the economy in Puerto Rico by paying our farm workers above minimum wage'. Turns out they weren't even paying them from their own pocket, but quite literally mine and others like me. There was a lawsuit. Google it.  Not only this but they opened a handful of new locations during the litigation while claiming financial instability as a way to get out of a settlement. Where do you think the capital for those new shops was coming from? Yeah. I could go on and on about other insane things these people have done, but I don't have three fucking days to type it all out. 

Anyway I'm tired of getting abused by entrepreneur types, billionaires, or in this case piss ant wannabe CEO dipshits. Fuck these people and the horrible way they treat their employees. I want rights and folks in NYC deserve more than their dumbass neon sign, wall of field turf, instagram overpriced bullshit.

1jptc5o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jptc5o,[1 Year UPDATE!] Roast my monthly expenses,"**TL;DR** \- I spent a year browsing personal finance subreddits, taken advice from folks, and adjusted my finances accordingly. I am now saving 40% of my income and aiming to purchase a house in a year and a half. You can compare the two charts and continue to roast my finance decisions in the comments!

Hey all! This is an update to the [post I made approximately one year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiddleClassFinance/comments/1bzspz4/roast_my_monthly_expenses/) in this subreddit. Last year, I came to this sub asking for advice on how to improve my monthly budget. A lot has changed since then but I wanted to share my progress and open the discussion again for folks to continue to roast my monthly expenses.

  
**Biggest changes since April 2024:**

1. My spouse and I got married! Our finances have not significantly changed, but we did receive a beefy discount on car insurance (that we pay for every six months, it gets taken out of the savings so it's not reflected here).
2. We funded our emergency fund in January of this year. We are now full-steam ahead on saving for a house.
   1. Last year, one of the topics I was seeking advice on was whether to contribute more to supplemental retirement accounts or to put money into an HYSA. We are wanting to buy a home in about 1.5 years, so we decided to put as much as we can into savings until we buy. After we buy, we'll reevaluate and start to put those contributions into a retirement account (controversial, I know)
3. We no longer have a car payment or any debt other than revolving credit utilization that gets paid for  from the Discretionary line item. 
4. I've made more realistic adjustments to the budget based on actual spending categories. Last year's Sankey was accurate but somewhat aspirational, and did not include things like household expenses, hobbies, etc. Some categories were added such as therapy, which probably looks like a lot, but we both go to therapy due to our work (we both work in mental health adjacent public sector jobs)
5. Some spending categories have seen a major reduction. Last year, a common criticism was that my food expenses were high for two people. I have reigned those expenses in somewhat, and I have added another food category for coffee, which we are now doing only 2-3 times a week instead of every day. We've also reduced our subscriptions, gas, and rent costs (we moved to a new place with a roommate). All of this has resulted in a nearly $1000 reduction in monthly expenses, which gets split into savings and discretionary funds. 

**Where are we going from here?** 

1. We are saving up for a down payment on a house and are on target to have the payment funded by late next year. 
   1. In the meantime, I am hoping to try to reduce our expenses further if possible. One difference you might see is that our discretionary spending item increased from 2024 to 2025. Our discretionary spending is not budgeted as strictly as our joint expenses, and I'm thinking there are some areas where we can cut costs to possibly increase our savings contributions to $3000 per month while we're saving for a house. I'm open to tips/advice on reducing expenses in the comments.
2. After we purchase a house, we will reevaluate our current savings and retirement contributions. My plan would be to get our retirement contributions to the 8% flat pension contribution and increase our 457b contribution to 16% of our gross income (about $1400/month)
3. I'm hoping both of us are able to make some career changes in the coming years for higher salaries and begin to plan for a family. ",4,1743612396.0,MiddleClassFinance,5,0.83,False

The bank hopes a more inviting space, dubbed “The Heist,” will encourage customers to physically go to the bank and not just use online options.

The building, located on 15 S. Fifth St., was “highly remodeled” after being leased to Flat Branch in early 2024 and was opened to the public March 17.

“We wanted to create an environment where people wanted to go to the bank,” said Erica Pefferman, Flat Branch Bank’s chief development officer.

The bank also plans to use The Heist coffee shop and martini bar to host private events and offer the space to clients for meetings.

This marks Flat Branch Bank’s second location, with the original located in Richmond, Missouri. The bank is an extension of Flat Branch Home Loans, which has a total of over 75 locations across the Midwest, including one at 101 S. Fifth St. in Columbia.

Flat Branch hopes the new location will serve as a blueprint for a further expansion across the Midwest.

I wanted to find out if anyone else had issues with leaking on this model or similar, and how good are the repairs? The customer service has been fine so far so this is not a rant. I just wanna know if repairs for leaks actually do get fixed because this is my first experience with a repair through the company.

For those who are curious, coffee-colored water comes rolling out of the bottom in the front at first, and then suddenly that turns into a lot of water towards the back over time.

Sitting in the backseat of my car enjoying the peace as we speak. No one is in the office but me today and tomorrow.

I work in a small insurance agency. The agent, my boss, is out of the country as well as one of my other coworkers. Then my *other* coworker called off today because her son hurt himself last night, and tomorrow she was already off on the account of family visiting. So it’s just me myself and I. 

Two main things I’m doing *my* way while everyone is out: My breaks and opening when we’re actually supposed to, not just because we’re physically in the office.

My two coworkers will turn our sign around to “open” when we get here at 8:30AM, even though we don’t actually open until 9AM and I HATE that! So that’s not happening when I’m the only one here. When I’m the one holding down the fort, it’s my rules. I don’t open until 9AM, as our publicly posted hours *clearly* state. Just because we’re here doesn’t mean we should service customers before we’re technically open. That 30 minutes is for US! To make coffee, get settled in, etc. not for customers. They have from 9am-5pm. That is plenty of damn time.

As for my breaks? My two coworkers, quite often, take  however long they want for their breaks, so it’s my turn. 

I’m also working at my own pace. If the phone rings 5 damn seconds after I hang up with a customer? I’m not picking that up. When everyone else is here they expect me to pick up every call, even if I can’t take a damn breath between them. Well not on my watch. I’m not working like a damn automatic assembly line.

You can copy-paste this directly into your post:

# New to Kratom – Is This Homemade Tea Safe? (+ Banana Peel Version?)

Hey everyone — I’m new to growing kratom and wanted to ask if this homemade nutrient tea is okay to use… and whether the banana peel version is a good idea too.

# 🌿 My Plant Situation:

* Recently received a few **rooted kratom plants**
* \~12–14 inches tall, in **3"" nursery pots**, definitely **rootbound**
* Likely **6–12 months old**
* They went through **travel shock** (wilted leaves, minor drop)
* Transplanted **1 week ago** into **3-gallon air pruning pots**

They’re indoors now (Zone 10), sitting next to a humidifier and a south-facing window.  
So far they’re bouncing back — new growth on 1 or 2 of them, nothing major yet.

# 🧪 Homemade Nutrient Tea (Already Made – Version 1)

**Per 1 liter of water:**

* 4–6 crushed, rinsed eggshells
* 1 tbsp used coffee grounds
* 1 tsp unsulfured molasses
* ¼ tsp Epsom salt (**Dr Teal’s brand**)

I cold-steeped this in a mason jar for 3–5 days, shaking daily. Planning to strain it today.

I also want to try boiling everything for 10 minutes and letting it sit overnight for a faster version.

# 🍌 Banana Peel Version (Haven’t Tried Yet)

Saw a variation online that adds **extra potassium & phosphorus** from banana peel:

**Per 1 liter of water:**

* 1 chopped banana peel
* 4 crushed eggshells
* 1 tbsp coffee grounds
* 1 tsp molasses
* ¼ tsp Epsom salt

→ Cold-steep for 3–5 days, strain before use

**Has anyone tried this version?** Not sure if it’s too strong for young/transplanted kratom.

# 🗓️ Feeding Plan:

* **Every 2 weeks**: one of these teas as a soil drench
* **Between feedings**: plain water or compost tea
* **Occasionally**: Epsom foliar spray (½ tsp per quart of water)

Just trying to keep it organic, simple, and not accidentally fry my plants. Any advice is appreciated — especially about that banana tea idea.

I've been feeding them mostly worm chow for the past few weeks. The bin was doing amazing! I had tons of baby red wigglers and cocoons all through. I went from feeding them a tablespoon every two days to 3 tablespoons every other day and they were housing it. I didn't re feed until gone.

I got worried that without veggies the bedding was going to get too dry. I added some apple cores and a few apple wedges, some coffee grinds, and a banana peel. I added a worm blanket a week ago to help keep the moisture in. I also got a spray bottle and lightly misted the chow when I added it.

5 days later I have issues. I was turning the bin last night and I noticed it was getting really warm. Not hot but noticeably warm on my hands when aerating. Maybe 70-75° I had a lot of condensation on the lid of the bin and tiny red mites racing along the side of the bin. They're the size of the period at the end of this sentence, but getting bigger.

So far I've added 1/4 calcium carbonate to reduce the ph in the bedding. I also doubled the volume of bedding adding shredded cardboard, and it was cold to the touch today matching ambient temps of about 65°.

I'm concerned about the mites though. where I seen one or two yesterday today i spotted maybe 5 in any quadrant if I  watched long enough. I assume if that's what I see they're like roaches and there are many more. I also know mites are part of the worm bin ecosystem and unavoidable, just controllable.

I'm so confused and frustrated right now. My house is 65° and its 38° outside. I have no idea how I got the mites into the bin and I feel like this is going to be a way bigger problem when it warms up. I've never had issues with mites in my gardens or home before. I feel like I'm putting my cannabis at risk just having them in the bin in the kitchen.

I started my worm bin to generate castings for my cannabis and vegetable gardens. If the bins and castings have spider mites in them how do I mitigate that so I'm not transferring them to my other gardens?

One last question, The urban worm bin blanket I got is a wool like material. I want to toss it to help the bin dry but there is probably 100 worms and a couple cocoons all tangled up in it. I don't feel like I can get rid of one without losing the other, so I'd be open to any suggestions on that as well.",1,1743611197.0,Vermiculture,0,1.0,False

- Pulled out all appliances, cleaned behind/

- Placed sticky traps - nothing ever showed up.

- No signs of droppings, casings, or live bugs since.

I haven’t done anything since Christmas except leave traps because it truly seemed like the issue was gone.

Then last weekend, I found these. I freaked out and started the whole process over:
- Sprayed WSG again, including backsplash, under cabinets, behind/under appliances, baseboards, trash can, and pipes.
- Also sprayed TEKKO for IGR support (I know some say it’s overkill but I had it).
- Cleaned out all cabinets, packed food into sealed bins.
I live above a coffee shop, and the tenants before me were not clean, so I know the odds were already stacked.

Now I’ve set reminders to spray every 2 weeks, and I’m just trying to stay ahead of it. Kitchen’s not spotless 24/7 (I have kids), but I keep it clean enough and take out the trash nightly.

Would love any feedback - does this seem like I caught something early again? Or am I missing something?

My credit union and my bank are screwing me and i don’t know how to stop it. I’m 19. I paid my credit card bill last month on the 16th, my bill was due yesterday, april first. In those 2 weeks between me paying and now, my credit union has taken my payment out of my account 3 times and each time they’ve told me they never received the payment and charged me fees out the wazoo  for it. 

i called them a week ago after i first noticed it and the guy literally said “it’s not our fault so it’s not our problem” and hung up on me. So i went to my bank and a wonderful banker raised hell to try and help me and actually got people to listen to her. She told me that she and some people higher up in the company would handle it for me and make sure i got my money back and that my credit union refunded me. The bank refunded me part of the money the credit union charged me which was more than generous in my opinion. 

I called my credit union two days ago to make sure they actually had received one of the payments at least and the woman i talked to said yes they had and she took the fees of my account. I thought that was the end of it. I went to use my credit card today to get coffee on my way to work and it was declined. So i looked and the payment had yet again been marked as “reversed” and id been charged yet another fee. 

Now my payment is late. I called them this morning and they told me they never received anything at all and that i need to call my bank. I’m completely fed up, i feel like i’m being walked all over. i’m not even 19 yet and it’s not like i make a lot of money for them to be doing this to me, im a self employed nanny and i make maybe $1000 per month. Any advice? my boyfriend wants to just give me his card and have me pay it in full witj that but i want to try and avoid that

1jpsmuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/taylorstitch/comments/1jpsmuu/caring_for_your_moto_jacket_and_giveaway/,Caring for your Moto Jacket (And Giveaway),"Hey Reddit, 

Michelle here. There have been some recent requests for a Moto Care Guide, which we do have on our site [here](https://www.taylorstitch.com/blogs/archive/care-guide-for-leather-jackets?srsltid=AfmBOorppDA_MF9l1yaK8VDTiNrfkypOGfKhYs-CoWZ9N7ia1QZPBym3). In addition to a care guide I wanted to provide a walk through to give folks a sense of what the care process looks like. So I took a damaged Moto Jacket from our inventory to talk through a bit of what to do (and not do including a fail on my part) in regards to caring for your jacket. And, we’ll even give you the opportunity to win this very jacket.

To be clear, I do want to say **do not attempt to do anything I’ve done on suede**. This walkthrough is only for top/full grain leather. Please refer to the guide linked above if you’re looking for suede guidance. 

This is going to be a long post, so grab a cup of coffee and here we go! 

Before working on a jacket, it's crucial to understand the nature of leather. 

1. Leather that is left wet will mold and rot. We don’t advocate using a leather jacket as a rain jacket but if it happens to get wet, make sure that it’s dry before storing it away. You can help it along by wiping your jacket down with a microfiber cloth, but make sure it’s fully dry before you put it in the closet—especially if you live in an area with high humidity. 
2. Leather is temperature sensitive. Unlike man-made materials, leather doesn’t do well with sudden shifts of temperature. If you have a wet jacket, don’t hang it on the radiator, put it in front of your heater, or take a blow dryer to it. Let leather air dry naturally. I don’t know why anyone would put a leather jacket in the freezer (don’t do it with your denim either!) in the opposite of the temperature direction but obviously, that’s also a no go. 
3. Leather, being a natural material, will crack and dry out with time and wear. You will need to condition your jacket regularly. How often it needs to be conditioned will be based a bit on point 1 and 2 and how often it’s worn. If you’ve been riding out in the sun, conditioning it is a good idea. If it’s gotten wet, also a good idea (once fully dry). If you’re unsure, feel the leather, if the texture has changed, it’s time to condition. 

Now this Moto came to me in pretty good shape. From a distance, I don’t think you could really see any problems. There were some surface scratches and the stain that you’ll hear about in more detail later. Here are some photos of how the jacket came to me:

[Note: This isn't the right hangar for this jacket, just a used for a quick photo! ](https://preview.redd.it/q38d2ys20gse1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6e877f509d0937ec7339c129605556da9f10520)

There is a line of light from a window, but it looks pretty good from a distance.

Looking closer: 

There is a dark spot that I had a hard time capturing and some scratches on the pocket. Along with some other scratches throughout, like on the arm. Note that the colors are going to vary as I worked on this jacket over several days and in different spots through my house with different lighting. 

https://preview.redd.it/px0vujw11gse1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1595ce2bf45db7d065ef999b7eb4a97748d7409

  
I noticed the leather felt overall ok but was dull and a little dry and could use a condition. Golden Bear recommends Cadillac Leather Lotion which I am familiar with and have used. But I also picked up the stain remover to address the dark spot. 

Following recommendations, before I did anything here, I patch-tested on the inside of the jacket to see what impact the [Cadillac Leather Lotion](https://cadillacleather.com/products/copy-of-premium-leather-lotion) and [Cadillac Leather Cleaner](https://cadillacleather.com/products/copy-of-premium-leather-cleaner) would have. I also tested with some water to get a sense of what impact that has.  



[Pink is water, Green is Leather Conditioner, Blue is Leather Cleaner](https://preview.redd.it/hnndko2v1gse1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af400d4da9eaeb333c8ae8acf9c32195590b4637)

  
There was no change where the Leather Conditioner was applied. And some slight color loss where the stain remover and the water was applied. 

https://preview.redd.it/1a963zp82gse1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44f879d09f5c74a481f553ded67842084f55e7a7

  
I busted out some new microfiber cloths since the ones I had were stained from previous projects. If you’re thinking of conditioning your jacket, do yourself a favor and use some new cloths, not that old rag in the garage covered in grease. 

When I condition leather, I work in sections, using the jacket itself as a guide from seam to seam. The Cadillac Leather Lotion is pretty easy to use, it’s a thin formula that easily works into the leather. But each leather conditioner is going to have a different viscosity.

I always put the conditioner on the cloth and then apply it to the jacket. You want control of how much you’re dispersing and not hitting one spot with a ton of conditioner by squeezing it directly on the jacket. I use circular motions and add more as needed. Some areas of the jacket may require a little more product and buffing, the best way to gauge how much to use is how much the jacket is soaking in. If it’s still taking the conditioner without feeling greasy or changing the hand feel, you can keep applying. 

Keep in mind, if you’re using a different product, the amount of conditioner needed may change and especially if you’re using a product that will change the color of the jacket, you want to be extra careful. Here is the result of conditioning one half of the jacket front. Left side freshly conditioned (not dry), right side untouched: 

https://preview.redd.it/oddkpcad2gse1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c315029bbd5ae7fb137ca9311c859e1d29dbb92e

  
I know it’s hard to see the power of conditioning, but here is the arm I showed in the second photo of the scratches post conditioning: 

https://preview.redd.it/s3dlt8wl2gse1.jpg?width=4220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=917ab7bdd12be5a68bf83e68cfcec4dce912ef22

And perhaps even better, here is the lower back panel before and after: 

[Before\/After](https://preview.redd.it/2l7tnts03gse1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e79c37bde63ab241a5409de7098f9362748437dc)

So much better! And here is a shot of the cloth post conditioning the entire jacket: 

https://preview.redd.it/tza2ksp33gse1.jpg?width=5517&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85f6c841f79f01360c8051c7ff7855ff18090275

And I’m happy to report that there was no color loss to the jacket overall nor was the jacket darkened. At this point, I’m winning. 

But things did go wrong. The stain! It is hard to paint an accurate picture of the stain because the photos didn’t capture it well, in person it was like a dark greasy smear. I was determined to get rid of it. 

Here is that not so great photo of said stain: 

https://preview.redd.it/75m3fbv73gse1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3b8fc8914377a5e296d1eea75ba7bce9348096d

  
I started with carefully spot cleaning the stain. Going slowly, letting the stain remover dry fully and assessing. First pass, minimal results. Second pass, same thing. The stain was lifting little by little and there was a lot of patience in applying, gently blotting, waiting and hoping. On my final pass, still trying to be as meticulous as possible, I blew through the finish on the leather. 

Behold my shame: 

https://preview.redd.it/6ups1vjc3gse1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=174f37a122c915a5db042ffc22a5aa8dc97a4afc

  
While small, the stain remains. Persistence was not in my favor and looking back, I should have stopped when I realized that I wasn’t making enough progress. FWIW, this isn’t my first time working on leather, I’m not an expert but I’m not a novice. Enough to act as a warning here. 

I was able to put a new finish on the spot, by using [Angelus 602 Matte Acrylic Finisher ](https://angelusdirect.com/products/matte-acrylic-finisher?srsltid=AfmBOop740aQTkENQa_I4ql6T4xNlLN_27CIRjBX6YYhs4Zv5ZNT8lib&variant=1050260288)(I had this on hand) and a tiny paintbrush (I really mean tiny!) I wanted to add a finish back where I broke through to protect the leather. I share my mishap here because in classic project fashion, nothing goes exactly as planned. And likewise, if you DIY you may make a similar mistake. But no fret, all problems are solvable.

  
Here is the jacket fully conditioned: 

https://preview.redd.it/4njncty84gse1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0855b890a15f280cdca45be6a0009d3cf0e1040e

At the end of the day I was pleased with how this turned out. Mistakes aside, it's a handsome jacket with a nice color. I was happy to give this new life. And it wasn’t too long a process either, all in all I’d guess this process should take 20-40 mins if it’s a standard recondition.

TLDR:

* Condition your jacket, especially if it gets wet (though let it dry), bakes out in the sun, or is feeling brittle 
* We recommend Cadillac Leather Lotion for moto jackets
* Test the conditioner in a hidden spot first to make sure you like the color change of conditioning. Apply conditioner with clean microfiber cloth, using panels of the jacket as a guide. Put the conditioner on the cloth, not your jacket and work in circular motions. Make sure to get all the areas like inside pockets, cuffs and placket too! 
* If you get to a point where what you’re doing isn’t getting the desired effect, time to call in the Pro’s

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please read this post in full before messaging me 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!
