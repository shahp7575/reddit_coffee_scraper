1gaxjji,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gaxjji/should_i_put_in_my_two_weeks_notice/,should I put in my two weeks‚Äô notice?,"Currently, I work at a small coffee shop, and I started around the beginning of September. When I first began, I wasn‚Äôt properly trained. I was basically taught to learn as I go, and even now, there are things I still haven‚Äôt been taught. Despite that, I used to get around sixteen hours a week, but for the past two weeks, my hours have been reduced to just four.

I messaged the owner‚Äôs daughter, who handles the scheduling, because I wanted to request more hours. She spoke to her mother (the owner), and they told me that my hours were reduced because they need someone who can work quickly while providing good service. They said that once I improve and can work without needing to ask for help, they would give me more hours. I haven‚Äôt replied yet, but I find this frustrating because if they had trained me properly from the beginning, I wouldn‚Äôt need to ask about things I haven‚Äôt been taught.

Also, I only ask questions when I truly don‚Äôt know something. I recently found out that a coworker complained to the owner that I‚Äôm slow, which I can‚Äôt really argue with because I know I‚Äôm not the fastest. I‚Äôm fairly certain I know who said it because I‚Äôve mainly worked with just one person. It‚Äôs disappointing because we were getting close, but instead of communicating with me directly, she went to the owner.

To add to that, there was an incident in the past where she got both of us in trouble, even though it was her fault. I lied to cover for her so she wouldn‚Äôt be blamed alone, but now I‚Äôm questioning if it was worth it.

Given everything, should I put in my two weeks‚Äô notice?

1gaxfpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/greatforkids/comments/1gaxfpk/is_a_floor_lamp_safe_for_a_toddlers_room/,Is a Floor Lamp Safe for a Toddler's Room?,"Lately, my toddler has embraced the art of exploration, transforming our living room into his personal adventure land. This significant milestone highlighted a glaring blind spot in our baby-proofing endeavors‚Äî[our floor lamps](https://greatforkids.org/kids-room/creative-floor-lamp-ideas-for-kids-room/). Up until this moment, our biggest concerns were covering light sockets and cushioning our chrome coffee table edges. However, after sharing a video of my little guy's escapades, the vulnerability of our floor lamps to curious, wobbly hands became alarmingly clear.

Our living room's lighting relies heavily on these lamps. The overhead light, while an alternative, casts a headache-inducing glare on the television, making it far from ideal. This context sets the stage for my quest: ensuring a safe, illuminated environment that blends seamlessly with toddler life. How much baby-proofing is actually necessary, and what can I do specifically about floor lamps to prevent accidents?

Throughout discussions with friends and my own observations, it's evident that the approach to baby-proofing is highly personal and varies greatly. Some advocate for wrapping nearly every surface in foam, others propose creating a ""baby jail""‚Äîa safe, enclosed play area with everything needed within reach, allowing parts of the house to maintain their original aesthetic and function with minimal adjustments.

Reflecting on these suggestions, I realize that a mix might serve us best. The idea of a play area resonates with me, providing peace of mind during those moments when direct supervision isn't feasible. Yet, for the times when our little one roams free, I recognize the need for a safety net that blends simplicity with effectiveness.

# My Solution

Given our reliance on floor lamps for lighting, removing them isn't an option. Instead, I decided to assess their design and placement through the lens of toddler safety. For starters, positioning lamps behind furniture can thwart direct access while still effectively illuminating the space. Additionally, selecting lamps with a sturdy base and shatter-resistant materials can mitigate the risks of tipping and breaking.

Incorporating these insights led me to explore floor lamps designed with child safety in mind‚Äîfixtures that are both durable and minimal in hazard potential. For added precaution, anchoring lamps to the wall, much like one would do with a bookshelf, further reduces the risk of them becoming a topple hazard.

While the journey to a toddler-proof living space continues to evolve, these initial steps toward securing our floor lamps have brought a sense of relief. Balancing safety with practicality doesn't have to mean a complete overhaul of one's living space aesthetics. It's about making thoughtful, informed adjustments that protect our little ones while preserving the essence of our home.

The endeavor to baby-proof, particularly with floor lamps, should not overshadow the joy of witnessing your toddler's first steps. With a strategic approach, it's entirely possible to create a living environment that supports their curiosity and mobility safely. After all, isn't adapting to their ever-changing needs what parenthood is all about?",1,1729756945.0,greatforkids,0,1.0,False

He is from NYC and I live in Canada. We shared a sweet connection that I can‚Äôt seem to forget. He continuously told me that he really liked me and felt a special connection with me. 

Throughout our time together in the Dominican, he was very respectful and sweet to me. He never pressured me to do anything with him that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing. On my last night there (he wasn‚Äôt leaving till a couple days after me), we went to his room where we made out for a while and things began to escalate so he asked if I wanted to have sex. I said yes and so we proceeded but he wasn‚Äôt getting hard. It made me feel self conscious because I thought that he wasn‚Äôt attracted to me and thought I was ugly. We then stopped and I told him that I should go as I have a flight early morning. He then walked me back to my friends. During the walk back he tried to hold my hand and wrap his arm around my waist but i just felt a bit crappy after what had happened so I kept pulling away from him. When we got to the place that my friends were at, he kissed me and wished me a safe flight back and I said to him that it was nice meeting him and that it‚Äôs crazy that we might never see each other again and to that he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say that, I hope to see you again one day‚Äù. 

The next morning before I boarded my flight, I sent him a message asking him for his instagram since we had not exchanged any socials, besides our phone numbers. I had a feeling he wouldn‚Äôt respond, and he didn‚Äôt.

Fast forward to a couple months later, my friend shared that she will be having her bachelorette party in nyc in a couple of months. We have booked our tickets for nyc.

I‚Äôm on 30mg vyvanse and have been for about 3 years and recently got a 5mg dex booster to take in the afternoon on days that I need it. I tried 40ng vyvanse first but it felt too high for me. 

Throughout these years on vyvanse my doctor has been concerned about my heart rate. At rest it‚Äôs always between 90 and 105. I‚Äôve done several EKG‚Äôs that all came back normal. My blood pressure is always normal, sometimes even slightly low. 

My heart rate even before medication has always been slightly higher than average, and when I measure it was n the morning before medication it‚Äôs usually like 75-85. So I don‚Äôt think the increase when I‚Äôm medicated is that big. I also don‚Äôt experience palpitations or shortness of breath. I usually have about one cup of coffee a day but that doesn‚Äôt seem to increase my heart rate. 

Is my heart rate really that much of a concern? I don‚Äôt want to start beta blockers because I feel they are unnecessary, my blood pressure is not high, and I‚Äôm worried about side effects like fatigue as I am not hyperactive and fatigue is one of my biggest adhd problems. 

If anyone has any insights so share or any experience with beta blockers I would be grateful!

Gotten a new grinder and it gave more clarity and sweetness but I want to try my own water again, ended up more hollow/weak cup and seems to bring out roasty bitter notes more. Whip out my C40 again and brewed with my own water and the cup was good again like it always had been (still new grinder + tap water is better).

My speculation from this phenomenon being that the simple mineral of the water recipe seems to be lacking to extract more from uniform grinds, but works well with grinder with more fines and taming the brew. 

At this point my conclusion is grinder more clarity isn't necessary a better choice, and a good water recipe is essential alongside with good coffee bean. Now I start to understand why even great coffee place like Koffee Mameya used tap water.

One morning I was making my usual coffee and a switch flipped and I just went wow fuck this I don‚Äôt want to weigh anything anymore and I genuinely couldn‚Äôt be fucked to weigh ANYTHING after months of weighing everything

- Restricting helps me stay productive and motivated to do life and see people and plotting and planning my calories to a psychotic extent makes me happy and euphoric almost so when that goes out the window I basically can‚Äôt function and just bed-rot and only derive happiness from food 

- For a month I was in the bed rot -> be miserable all day -> binge at night -> wake up miserable -> bed rot cycle (depressing ik) 

- I didn‚Äôt leave the house or see my friends bc I hated being puffy/bloated from my meal before and that just kept me in the cycle 

- I basically only ate Wingstop. Maybe like 5 days a week LOL. I literally just couldnt eat anything else and on days I forced myself to not order it a couple times a week I‚Äôd be so sad that I couldn‚Äôt have Wingstop again. I don‚Äôt know what they put in it, but even right now I would still eat Wingstop everyday for the rest of my life. I love it so much. 

- I spent way more money just staying home doing nothing then going out with my friends 

- I didn‚Äôt count calories but I‚Äôd say I averaged like >!500-1000!< over my TDEE a day 

- Still haven‚Äôt weighed myself but seen some visible changes esp on my face, chest, thighs, and stomach. Biggest difference on my face and stomach and upper thighs  

- didn‚Äôt look in the mirror for a month basically. biggest shock was how my eyebrows looked completely grown out and how hairy I can get lol 

- even though I technically should have more energy while eating well, I have so much more fatigue when I‚Äôm binging. So while restricting, I could work out, stretch, and had the stamina and interest to see people. While binging, I am so tired I can only stay in bed. I‚Äôm sleepy all the time and don‚Äôt have the energy to get on my yoga mat, even though I wanted to. 

- slowly coming out of it - had a few false starts in the last month where I thought I was over it but wasn‚Äôt.  Haven‚Äôt ordered food delivery in a handful of days, starting eating veggies again, and feeling a little more like myself. Fatigue is still here but I think that I will have to work on it more rather than wait for it to come back naturally.

I (23F) had sent out my baby shower invitations virtually Friday September 27 with the following message that was sent to everyone in the group chat:

Hey Family, here's the invite for Ensleys baby shower, I hope you all can make it, let me know if you need me to send you the link for the registry directly. It is a small venue with limited seating so I ask that you please do not extend the invitation to anyone, everyone in the family has been accounted for but if there's any questions feel free to reach out to me. God bless you guys, pray you all can make it.

Now like the message says this is a small venue with only 80 seats, only family was invited because of how small the place is. Majority of the family that's coming is my mother in law and father in law sides of the family other than my parents, my sisters and a few cousins I'm not able to invite all my family because we need to keep it small.

The day that I sent that message my husband's sister in law, Annette (36F) called my husband's parents crying because her parents and siblings were not invited to my baby shower and that the message I put in the group chat was signaling her out because she's the only one with ""extended family."" Annette had asked our mother in law Daphnie(53F) if she could create a new group chat and include her parents and siblings and resend the invite. Daphnie told her that she wouldn't be able to do that because of the limited seating and essentially she wasn't going to go over me and my guest list and invite her family without my permission. All of this I found out 3 days after sending the invite. I got the hint that she was upset with me because we had a church fellowship the following day, Saturday Sept. 28 where my husband (Christopher 31M), his brother (Charlie 35M Annettes Husband) and myself participate in praise and worship. She completely ignored me the whole event which was really awkward and obvious and thats what led me to ask Daphnie what was up with Annette and she then told me the phone call they had with her and how she was upset with me because I didn't invite her family to my baby shower.

After a couple days I reached out to Annette and sent her this message on October 5th: 

Hey Annette, I just wanted to reach out to you and check on you. I hope all is well. I spoke with Daphnie recently and I had asked her if you had mentioned any hurt you were feeling towards me or Chris after I noticed that you kind of ignored me Saturday and dodged my hug. I asked her with the intention of just wanting to see where you were at emotionally and if we had done anything to make you feel slighted in any type of way but most of all, not continue any environment of hostility between us if there was any. I love you and Charlie and the kids. The last thing I want is for there to be any unspoken offense between us. I just wanted to let you know that you can always come to me and talk to me. I feel like Christopher and I have always given you space to speak into us and our relationship so I felt like you could come to me for anything, but I know I have never explicitly said that so I just wanted to take some time today and let you know that I love you, I welcome you and invite you to share any feelings and thoughts you have with me. I promise to listen and consider your heart. I don't want their to be any rift in the family over something that we can smooth over between us. Please call or text, or even if you want to get together for some coffee or something I'd love to.

She still has not responded since then. We've been in the same place 3 times since I've reached out to her and sent this message and she continues to ignore me. According to my husband, his cousin (24F) and my mother in law, this is typical Annette behavior.

This whole situation infuriates me since I tried to reach out and squash the beef yet she continues to act like a child ignoring me because her family wasn't invited to my baby shower. Which first of all is due to limited seating and second, it's MY baby shower. The more I  think about it, the less I want someone so self centered and bitter at the party I'm throwing to welcome my daughter into the world. And if she hasn't bothered speaking to me now is she planning to show up and ignore me at my baby shower?  

Mind you I'm not even able to invite all of my family because again only 80 seats. And even though I don't have to, I would've patiently explained that to her. But instead she'd rather cry to our in laws and try to make me seem like some asshole for excluding her family and then try to go above me and have our mother in law send the invite to her family regardless. Also for context she sent the invitation for my sons birthday party to her family without my permission. It seems to me like she wants to have these events centered around her, I honestly don't want to entertain or enable her childish behavior so I want to uninvite her. I'm torn because I know how petty she is and will probably try and retaliate by not allowing us or my in laws to see her kids if we don't let her have her way (which she's done a handful of times before) and I don't want to put my in laws in that position but at the same time I'm tired of her shit.

So, how big do you think Ridu is? Can we tell from anything in game or in promo materials? I'm guessing it must encompass a pretty sizable area, perhaps equivalent to a smallish but self sufficient nation, maybe around the size of Honshu in Japan. My main lines of reasoning for this are:

-Chapter 4 explores the Outer Ring, mentioning trade routes, multiple towns, old ruins, and numerous gangs. It seems to be a pretty expansive area, and since it seems to take a decent amount of time to drive out there, there's gotta be some stuff in between. Which leads us to the main point...

-The prosperity of New Eridu. If you think about it, the noodle shop alone shows how good they have it in New Eridu. Blue collar workers can afford a bowl of noodles with real meat, seafood, and veggies for their lunch. No recycled, processed nutrient slop here! They can even have energy drinks and fresh ground coffee! Now, New Eridu isn't a small city - it's got a metro system, multiple quarters, skyscrapers, etc. That's a lot of people to feed, and the fact that they can get a variety of high quality foods must mean they've got plenty to go around. Unless they've managed to make an ultra-space efficient way to raise crops and livestock, this must mean they've got quite a lot of farmland, maybe even some large lakes or some coastline they can access.

I (23F) had sent out my baby shower invitations virtually Friday September 27 with the following message that was sent to everyone in the group chat:

Hey Family, here's the invite for Ensleys baby shower, I hope you all can make it, let me know if you need me to send you the link for the registry directly. It is a small venue with limited seating so I ask that you please do not extend the invitation to anyone, everyone in the family has been accounted for but if there's any questions feel free to reach out to me. God bless you guys, pray you all can make it.

Now like the message says this is a small venue with only 80 seats, only family was invited because of how small the place is. Majority of the family that's coming is my mother in law and father in law sides of the family other than my parents, my sisters and a few cousins I'm not able to invite all my family because we need to keep it small.

The day that I sent that message my husband's sister in law, Annette (36F) called my husband's parents crying because her parents and siblings were not invited to my baby shower and that the message I put in the group chat was signaling her out because she's the only one with ""extended family."" Annette had asked our mother in law Daphnie(53F) if she could create a new group chat and include her parents and siblings and resend the invite. Daphnie told her that she wouldn't be able to do that because of the limited seating and essentially she wasn't going to go over me and my guest list and invite her family without my permission. All of this I found out 3 days after sending the invite. I got the hint that she was upset with me because we had a church fellowship the following day, Saturday Sept. 28 where my husband (Christopher 31M), his brother (Charlie 35M Annettes Husband) and myself participate in praise and worship. She completely ignored me the whole event which was really awkward and obvious and thats what led me to ask Daphnie what was up with Annette and she then told me the phone call they had with her and how she was upset with me because I didn't invite her family to my baby shower.

After a couple days I reached out to Annette and sent her this message on October 5th: 

Hey Annette, I just wanted to reach out to you and check on you. I hope all is well. I spoke with Daphnie recently and I had asked her if you had mentioned any hurt you were feeling towards me or Chris after I noticed that you kind of ignored me Saturday and dodged my hug. I asked her with the intention of just wanting to see where you were at emotionally and if we had done anything to make you feel slighted in any type of way but most of all, not continue any environment of hostility between us if there was any.

So guys this is an alt account and looking for some serious advice. Creating a new account to avoid creep‚Äôs DM abt this issue. 

TLDR: my niece dating a creep and he is in my house all the time testing waters. How to put a stop without creating another issue.

My family is messed up to start with, we are all women in the house. My sister is working and has no time for family.  She is not separated but says cant live with her husband. She has had her share of affairs or still has and the kids knows abt it. I told my mother to ask her to stop but my mom was a mute spectator and now the kids following the mother‚Äôs path. 
My niece and her bf are school/college sweethearts and recently turned 18. The BF used to come to our house often but used to behave decent. But after turning 18, he is turning to be a creep. Gosh it was so embarrassing for me to be around this and i was in shock to say anything. 
So since, 2-3 weeks when am on work travel this guy finds excuse to stay back in our house and in the middle of the night both were upto something it seems and my mo ok m woke up to go to the bathroom and saw them together. She asked what they were doing and they just moved away. My mom says she saw a lot many things and she is also creeped out. 

She (my mom) has been telling me ask that guy not to come, but I thought he was harmless. Now my mom is saying they are always touching each other and just stops when my mom walks in. 

So the other day I went shopping and this guy and my niece joined me and we went to a coffee shop and they were sitting opposite me and suddenly he pulls her and started doing things under the table in front of me. I was so shocked. It was a public place, am an elder person and it was so disgusting. I didn‚Äôt react but i ignored to avoid creating a scene.

We are home and they still there I walk in the kitchen and they doing something near the sink they move a little away when they see me. 

So I don‚Äôt know how my sister is not seeing all this or she seeing it and ignoring. 

If i warn them, am afraid she might do something untoward. The girl is very arrogant. But if I don‚Äôt we might soon have a pregnant woman in the house. Do i talk to my sister? What should i say. Anyways am gonna be ending up in the wrong here coz she will not let her daughter down. ",1,1729753098.0,family,1,1.0,False

The tables are limited, and most students just leave their laptops or notebooks on the tables to keep them booked for hours and then mostly just come back to pick their stuff and leave because presumably their plans change. So I and most others have learned to just use the tables no matter what is kept over it. My coffee breaks take hardly 20 minutes and I mostly never even see the person who left their stuff.

My friend and I went in. I saw an empty table and then we ordered on the counter. When we went to sit at the table, there was a bottle kept there. There was another empty table with two laptops. We chose the bottle table to sit. Two minutes later a couple comes and claims we took their table. My friend immediately jumped to his feet and started apologising. I didn‚Äôt hear what the couple said to him, but I was annoyed that my friend was having to apologise for no reason. 

I too got up but complained that students leave their stuff around for hours. How are we supposed to know who will come back and when? I was still ready to move to the other table, till the guy from the couple started giving snarky responses. He said they just came in, and kept the bottle. Again, how was I supposed to know? Also he ordered right after us, so there‚Äôs a good chance that he saw an empty table and dropped his bottle so that we don‚Äôt take it.

I was still grabbing my bag and letting them sit, before he went ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a table man!‚Äù. So I said, if it‚Äôs just a table, why don‚Äôt you take any of the other free ones? His girlfriend was looking at me as if she couldn‚Äôt believe how absurd I‚Äôm being. I said usually people don‚Äôt behave so rudely to each other inside the university. Which is true. People are polite and accommodating. He said I don‚Äôt need to teach him how to behave. I said I clearly do. Someone cleared a table in the back while this was happening, so they went and sat there.

My friend was very upset that I caused a scene over such a small thing. I was upset that he left me alone and didn‚Äôt say one word in my support. He just doesn‚Äôt like confrontations and hated it when anyone argued around him. What do you all think, aita?",0,1729752842.0,AmItheAsshole,4,0.5,False

I approach a coffee by ignoring the tasting notes and using info like roast level, origin, process method etc to determine a base line recipe to begin with.

On the v60 it had a delicate body, lots of sweetness and pleasant acidity. I will generally make a personal rating on these and venture only so far as Berry, nuts, stone fruits etc. However this cup was so clear and notes so pleasant and pronounced I made two specific observations - fresh raspberrys with vanilla bean. Lo and behold! 2 out of the three notes the roaster has on their site. Not given to exaggeration, I will say this was one out of the two best cups of Indian coffee I have ever had! Hehe.

Nothing untoward or 'intimate' occurred over the course of the 4 dates we'd been on. I decided that although, romantically, she didn't really 'tickle my pickle', I quite enjoyed her company and conversation. She is kind, intelligent and very funny. I wanted to remain friends and keep the boundary as such.
Perhaps naively on my part, both on our own and in the company of our mutual friends, we had been for a few coffees and a catch up. I dropped her home after one of these coffee meets a few days ago and before she got out of my car she tried to kiss me. I turned my head away and felt extremely awkward.
Since then, I haven't responded to any of her messages as I felt pretty weird about the situation. It would have been cool to remain friends with her as she is a great person, I just couldn't see myself in a relationship with her.
Is it a d*ck move, to sever the friendship completely or should I have one more attempt at trying to set boundaries? Part of me feels as though I should be cruel to be kind.

However, I am completely clueless about the finer aspects of coffee. This is partly a result of my budgets, partly a result of my intellectual arrogance (I'm an older millenial (33M) and was one of those types who thought cheaping out and not splurging on oneself and loved ones was something to be proud of).

However as I have gotten older and more financial successful, I have realized that the deeper aspects of coffee are a conversation topic in themselves and having wide knowledge about this, adds to one's personality. Moreover in my social circles, almost everyone has some deeper knowledge in either coffee, or tea, or alcohol, or all of them. It is after all a sign of a refined personality.

And here I am, completely ignorant of all the aspects of coffee whether making, brewing, equipment, beans, roasts etc. If someone would put me into a coffee tasting event or in a good coffee shop I would be completely clueless. I have realized I want to be someone who can have some conversations on this topic.

So, where do I start reading/learning about this ? Is Wikipedia a good option and if yes, how do I start/structure my search ? Sny other websites ? Please understand my knowledge of coffee is limited to instant coffee (which I am quite fond of). ",2,1729752164.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

So guys this is an alt account and looking for some serious advice. Creating a new account to avoid creep‚Äôs DM abt this issue. 

TLDR: my niece dating a creep and he is in my house all the time testing waters. How to put a stop without creating another issue.

My family is messed up to start with, we are all women in the house. My sister is working and has no time for family.  She is not separated but says cant live with her husband. She has had her share of affairs or still has and the kids knows abt it. I told my mother to ask her to stop but my mom was a mute spectator and now the kids following the mother‚Äôs path. 
My niece and her bf are school/college sweethearts and recently turned 18. The BF used to come to our house often but used to behave decent. But after turning 18, he is turning to be a creep. Gosh it was so embarrassing for me to be around this and i was in shock to say anything. 
So since, 2-3 weeks when am on work travel this guy finds excuse to stay back in our house and in the middle of the night both were upto something it seems and my mo ok m woke up to go to the bathroom and saw them together. She asked what they were doing and they just moved away. My mom says she saw a lot many things and she is also creeped out. 

She (my mom) has been telling me ask that guy not to come, but I thought he was harmless. Now my mom is saying they are always touching each other and just stops when my mom walks in. 

So the other day I went shopping and this guy and my niece joined me and we went to a coffee shop and they were sitting opposite me and suddenly he pulls her and started doing things under the table in front of me. I was so shocked. It was a public place, am an elder person and it was so disgusting. I didn‚Äôt react but i ignored to avoid creating a scene.

We are home and they still there I walk in the kitchen and they doing something near the sink they move a little away when they see me. 

So I don‚Äôt know how my sister is not seeing all this or she seeing it and ignoring. 

If i warn them, am afraid she might do something untoward. The girl is very arrogant. But if I don‚Äôt we might soon have a pregnant woman in the house. Do i talk to my sister? What should i say. Anyways am gonna be ending up in the wrong here coz she will not let her daughter down. ",2,1729751789.0,Coconaad,2,0.75,False

Recently I started meeting a blonde woman in a car on the road who also delivers for Wolt, we always wave to each other to say hello when we meet.

Yesterday I was picking up an order at a restaurant, coincidentally I noticed a car parked outside the restaurant that reminded me of hers, so I figured she was probably already in the restaurant, so I walked in but she was nowhere to be found. After I took my order and went to my coke, she got out of the car and waved at me in a way that she flexed all her fingers at a time instead of waving her whole palm. 

Later that day, I ordered food through Wolt and she happened to arrive. Right after she got out of the car she asked me if she delivers food elsewhere, so I confirmed it and said that she sometimes delivers it to my parents' house. 

Then I told her that I'd seen her today. She thought for a moment and said she remembered seeing me on my bike. Then we said goodbye and she said she would remember me from then on.

I plan on asking her out for coffee the next time we meet. 

Am I reading her signals correctly, is she interested in me?

1gawald,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gawald/should_i_get_a_crown_to_address_sensitivity_from/,Should I get a crown to address sensitivity from the exposed root on the side of my molar?,"I've been having extreme sensitivity on the bottom right side of my mouth for the last month. Basically after any meal or brushing, it throbs for an hour or two. I can't sleep without taking naproxen because it aches when I lie down. I also can't chew anything remotely firm on that side.

At a dentist appointment a couple of weeks ago, we seemed to determine that there were a couple of things going on. My farthest back molar is sensitive to chewing pressure on the biting surface. This tooth had a crown put on last year (but no root canal). The next forward molar is sensitive on the exposed side of the root where the gum has receded. They took x-rays during the visit, but they didn't mention seeing any issues.

The dentist recommended a crown (and no root canal) for that tooth as a first step. There's a already a large filling that covers the whole biting surface, and he said a crown would address the side sensitivity as well, since the crown extends below the gum.

I've been using a prescription fluoride toothpaste for the last couple of weeks. It seems to have helped my general tooth sensitivity, but not the current acute issue. All of my teeth seem to have a similar level of maybe ""Class I"" recession, so I'm wondering why this one tooth is so much more sensitive than the other teeth.

Some of my questions to help decide what to do next: 

-Is a crown the best option for this exposed root sensitivity? Should I consider a gum graft for the one tooth instead? Is a graft something a dentist wouldn't recommend, because it's not what they do?

-Should I consider a root canal on the tooth that already has a crown and is extremely sensitive to pressure? Could the issue in that tooth be causing the root sensitivity in the neighboring tooth? Or vice versa?

-Should I address one of these teeth first? The rear molar feels like it has the more serious issue, since I can't chew with it at all. But the next forward molar causes the long term throbbing, which is the hardest to deal with.

I don't smoke or drink alcohol. I do drink coffee. Maybe 1 can of soda a week. I'm 40 years old and wear a nightguard religiously.

Boredom does things to you. After getting a *surprising* number of matches, I decided to go on a few dates. And let me tell you about my second date.

We both decided to take the WFH route and hang out at the same time (perks of remote work, right?). He even came to pick me up from my house‚Äî*green flag!* We headed to Starbucks, 'cause free WiFi *and* coffee? Two essentials for working, obviously. Things were going smoothly, conversation was flowing... until I noticed something. A hickey. Yep. A hickey.

Who shows up on a first date with a hickey?! Seriously, what was I expecting from a Bumble date?

But wait, it gets worse. When I casually (okay, not so casually) asked him about it, he goes, ""Oh, this? My friend's girlfriend gave it to me as a dare during a game."" *What?!* Is that supposed to make it better?

After that little *gem* of a conversation, we headed to ""Daily Sushi""‚Äîa Pan-Asian spot. Apparently, he was trying to impress me because, yes, I‚Äôm a K-drama fan (he was really trying). But after the hickey incident, he had already lost a *lot* of points.

We were both supposed to be working during this time, right? I got pulled into a few work calls, ended up working for about three hours. And what does he do? Takes a nap. Yep. Three hours. (I‚Äôm sure he must be tired after having a rough night with the¬†*hickey girl*¬†)

Oh, and get this‚Äîhe called me ""blind"" because I wear glasses. Now, I usually take jokes pretty well, but my eyes? That‚Äôs a sensitive topic for me.

At this point, I was ready to log off and leave. But he insisted we go to a library because he knows I love reading. So, we go, explore the shelves, and he even read some romantic lines from a book for me. Cute, right? Well, it was... until he hit me on the head with that same book.

By now, the whole vibe felt more ""friendly hangout"" than ""romantic first date."" Where were the butterflies? The excitement? The nervousness? I felt none of that.

Then he drops the bomb. He tells me he feels a special connection and wants to meet again. I straight-up told him, ""I can only see you as a friend, not more."" And his response? ""I‚Äôll make you fall in love with me."" Sir, we just met. Future talk already?

He dropped me home, and the date ended with a hug.

So, here's the question: *Do I give him another shot or stick with my gut and move on?* Also, would you go on a second date with someone who naps during a work date, brings hickeys from ""dare games,"" and throws around books (literally) ?",2,1729751468.0,dating,3,1.0,False
1gaw92y,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoymed/comments/1gaw92y/what_is_it_like_to_be_an_ent/,What is it like to be an ENT? ,"Hello and good day doctors! Im overwhelmingly happy to see a lot of new posts asking about ENT residency training. üòÖ So maybe i can shed some light on this matter:
1. Saan po ba maganda mag train? 
-PSOHNS website will give you a list of all accredited training institutions both within metro manila and provincial hospitals. In my opinion, walang ""best"" dyan. Meron lang sigurong difference sa approach in teaching the residents. Pwedeng more on theory or more on skill pero sa dami narin ng institutions na nagooffer ng training for ENT, it would be really difficult to find the ""perfect"" institution. üòÖ

2. Ilan po ba ang tinatanggap per year?
-depends on the institution's bed capacity and resident-to-patient ratio. But most institutions when newly accredited start out with 1 or 2 residents per batch, and would increase later on. Some hospitals with an 800 or 1000 bed capacity may have as much as 5 to 6 residents per batch.

3. Saturated na ba ang practice? 
-from what i can observe. Medyo saturated na sa manila. Im from luzon so i wouldnt know the situation in visayas lr mindanao, but in manila, medyo marami rami na din ang ENT dun. In my province (Rizal) i think there are less than 20 of us here for the entire province. Overall, there are i think less than 2,000 fellows of the society as of last year's induction. 

4. Is ENT a lucrative specialty?
-for me the ""lucrativeness"" of the practice can be very subjective. I started my practice last february and im already earning 2x or 3x or sometimes even 4x of what my salary was when i was a resident (i was MO IV on my 4th year of residency) . Is it excessive? No. Is it enough? Very much. I've only been in practice for 9 months and can see and feel my practice steadily growing. üëå

5. How is the work/life balance? 
-fantastic.üëå As so many people have mentioned, ENT covers both medical and surgical management of patients. So if you are someone who likes being in the OR but at the same time seeing patients in the clinics, this is one specialty you should really consider. Plus, a lot of office based procedures like endoscopy, ear cleaning, foreign body removal are charged on top of your consultation fee. So kahit wala ka masyadong for OR na patients, mabubuhay ka sa opd. And majority of our ORs Are elective. So very seldomly are we called for emergencies. My daily routine starts with clinics that start at 9 or 10am and ends as early as 1pm or as late as 4pm depending on the day. Im always home for dinner, and i wake up to slow mornings with coffee dates with my wife. üòä I also have dedicated off days during the week for my ORs so that they dont affect my clinic schedules. 

6. What to do after graduating from residency? 
-there are a lot of subspecialties available after passing the diplomate board exams. This is a must if you wish to join a training institution, but if you will be having a purely private practice. Di mo na kailangan mag subspec.üòâ For as long as capable and confident ka to do surgeries under those subspecs, you can. Because you are taught how to do them anyway during residency. üòä

7. Is it worth it? 
-YES. lahat naman ng residency training mahirap. Lahat may pros and cons, So you really have to want what you're training for. 

ENT may not be for everyone, so im hoping i've answered some of your questions and helped you to decide wether to go into ENT or not. üòÖ ",27,1729751464.0,pinoymed,2,0.94,False

I recently started my second job once again in a office where it so happened they needed a bilingual person to help them in a role of paralegal, my previous job was still in a law field but it was personal injury my current job does only immigration which I was very excited to learn about or so I thought. 
After starting to work I soon realized no one wanted or cared to give me proper explanation oh how things ( forms, mailing, filling) are done they only came with excuses like ‚Äúoh we have example look at this persons name on drive and you will see‚Äù 
I would look at example but since every case is different it didn‚Äôt make sense and i was still looking at Egyptian symbols. Soon the lady who would answer the phone called started going on a coffee break quite often leaving all the phone calls for me with me.. and it was not fun since most of the client are angry complains and asking me questions which I have no answer for and they demand you to get those answers not the person who is working on their case. 
4 weeks in and I started getting shoved cases, tasks which I have no idea how to do since there was no training nothing, and once it‚Äôs with you, you are the responsible person for it. No one is helping out when I am asking questions and I simply stoped asking for help or simple explanation since they give such vague answers they make you feel stupid and it‚Äôs just bunch of words without any context. 
I started to have sleeping problems because I am worried about those clients who think their cases are ready or already sent which are not. 
I tend to ignore important dead lines since I am getting no help from other coworkers and I just lie to mad clients that their cases are submitted to avoid it from me. 
After 4 months I started lacking at work when I used to finish all the tasks for the day within 4 hours now I just do 2 unimportant tasks and call it a day. 

I started loosing appetite.
I no longer communicate with my friends only on weekend and I am just exhausted and can‚Äôt even talk to them the way I used to.
I vanished from social media where I was once active.
I stopped going outside.
I started gaining weight. 
I can‚Äôt recognize the person in the mirror with dark circle eyes and no expression 
I am slowly going downhill with thoughts I‚Äôm having at buss rides when I‚Äôm going to work. 
I am just 25 and I feel exhausted from life. 
I tried looking for new job still am especially since I am in New York but be real.. indeed and LinkedIn are filled with shit. I‚Äôve been sending my resume endlessly and I get no answer it‚Äôs just bunch of fake hirings and if there is real one they require you to have all the knowledge in world. 

But after work I can‚Äôt help but feel the guilt that I am a horrible person making people wait and probably ruining their cases.
Even tough I just do forms.

That‚Äôs all I wanted to say, I don‚Äôt really talk about my problems since I have hard time opening up to someone from past trust issues and traumas I had but I needed to say it somewhere because it‚Äôs choking me and eating me alive. I don‚Äôt want this and I can‚Äôt continue this.
