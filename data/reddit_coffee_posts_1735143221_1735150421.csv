1hm5nqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1hm5nqo/the_mystery_bag/,The Mystery Bag,"A week or so earlier, I was running late for work. In my rush, I grabbed my lunch bag from the fridge and bolted out the door. It felt heavier than usual, but I didn’t think much of it.

On the train, I noticed a faint smell. Not a bad smell, just…odd. I figured it was someone else’s breakfast or maybe coffee. I ignored it.

At the office, I sat at my desk and finally opened my bag. Inside, instead of my neatly packed sandwich and apple, there was a soggy, leaking container of…curry?

That’s when I realized. I didn’t grab my lunch bag. I grabbed the leftovers from last night’s dinner. And not just any leftovers—the spicy curry my roommate made and forgot to label.

The smell was now much stronger, filling my corner of the office. My coworker walked by and raised an eyebrow. “Early lunch?” he asked.

I quickly zipped the bag shut, but the damage was done. Everyone nearby was sniffing the air, trying to figure out where the smell was coming from. I spent the rest of the day pretending I didn’t notice.

When lunchtime came, I tried to eat it anyway. But without a fork or napkins, it turned into a mess. By the end, I had curry on my shirt and a deep sense of regret.

Lesson learned: always double-check the bag before leaving home. And maybe stop sharing a fridge with a roommate who cooks stronger curries than me.",1,1735150048.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

The salary that I get for being homeless is not bad but in the end, I still must be homeless, because that is what I get paid for. It is by far the strangest job I have ever had and who knew someone could get paid for being on the streets no matter the weather. Oh, those naturists have no idea just how vicious nature can be when it is raining and the wind blowing it all at you with the full force of the cold air. I go through it all though and because I get paid to be homeless and I was raised to be responsible and to always do a good job because I get paid for it. All jobs are honourable no matter what the job requires but there are times I just want to run away and forget I have done such a job as being homeless.

My co-workers aren’t really co-worker but rather other homeless people who don’t really know that I am being paid to be like them. So how and why does someone get employed to be homeless and live outside where all of nature is looking down on you, I feel like an animal on a daily basis. I got this job through an agency, and they put through to some shady looking company and they asked me whether I believed in vampires. That’s right they actually used the term vampires, and I laughed my head off.

The person interviewing me wasn’t laughing at all and he was being dead on serious, and he was a logical fellow and so how could he believe in such phony creations. I was desperate for money, and I was willing to be homeless as it seemed like an easy job on the outside. I thought to myself instead of being stuck in some warehouse or some other office type job where I will be required to reach targets but instead, I get to just wander around outside where it seemed like a fun job. In the summer its ok but even then the heat can be excruciating and the stink that human beings can produce is abysmal.

I asked them which area I was going to be homeless at and it was a completely other city which I was no stranger to as I had been there before. When I asked who these vampires were the employer simply told me to ask the public “where the man who complains about no one robbing his house lives and where the other man is who tries to make people shop at small local businesses” and that’s all I had. When I had accepted the job they took me into another room and there were contracts and these were the type of contracts that were used to solidify someone owning a house or a mortgage.

There was a dying man in this room and when I signed the contract my employer looked down at me and said “from here onwards your home will be everything under the atmosphere of planet earth. The outside world will always be your home and you will never be allowed to go inside anywhere” and the dying man finally let out his last sigh of air. My employer said that the dying man had been an employed homeless man for many years and now it was my turn.

I was taken to this other city with some necessities and a bag and I wandered around this city just trying to find a place to sleep in. I followed other homeless people and I asked them about the man who complains about no one robbing him and about the second man who complains that people should only shop and buy from local and small businesses. It was my luck and these homeless men knew the area so well and I took their advice and I found the first man who always complains that no one ever robs him.

His house was in serious need of repair, and I could hear him shouting from his window that “no body ever robs my house and I try so hard to make it look so good but now one ever robs my house. It offends me that no one ever robs my house because that means my house isn’t good!” he shouted from the top of his lungs. Then two people walking past his house and they heard him so desperately wanting someone to rob his house as it will make him think that his house is a good fashionable house. The two people looked at each other and they were interested in robbing him and the front door opened wide on its own. I could feel in my bones that something was wrong here and it didn’t feel right to go into that house.

The two men who wanted to rob this guys house were also thinking about whether they should rob his house or not. They would take a few steps closer to his house and then they would take a few steps back but the man inside the house was getting more and more desperate. He started to say how he had rare collectable inside his house that could be sold for thousands of pounds and the two men began to perk up again. The man inside the house started showing off his rare antiques from the Victorian era and even older eras.
The two men went inside the house to rob him but all that happened was that I had heard a loud scream. I walked towards the house and through the windows I could see the man who wants to be robbed, sucking on the blood of both guys who went inside the house. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and my world view was completely skewed. It was predatory and full of hatred and both men just crawling on the floor not knowing what to do or what was going on.

The man who lived inside the house then spotted me and with blood soaked mouth and black eyes he walked up to the front door, but he couldn’t get out even though the door was open. Some invisible force was stopping him from stepping outside and all he said to me was “invite me into your house” and I was confused because I was outside. The vampire then shouted at me saying “invite me into your house” and then it all made sense. That contract I had signed which made all of outside under the atmosphere of earth my home and vampires need permission to enter any home.

So as the outside world was my home this vampire needed my permission to enter the outside world, this vampire is imprisoned by this house. We were just staring at each other and no scrap of humanity was left inside this vampire and I wondered how old this vampire was with all of the rare artefacts inside the house. The vampire then said to me “so where is the other homeless old man is he dead now?” and I honestly didn’t know what to say to him. I guess this job is passed on from person to person to keep this vampire imprisoned inside the house.

“how is it being homeless up to now? It will only get tough” the vampire told me

I walked away and the first week being homeless was tough and I was sleeping on park benches on pavements. I was being pushed away by people and the looks I got from the public were humiliating and even though I was the one keeping a vampire trapped inside his house, no one knew. It was tough being homeless and how these other homeless people did it was just beyond me. I needed to find this other person who always shouts at people for helping small local businesses. Again my fellow homeless people helped me where to find him and he lived in a different kind of place which was half a business and half a house.

You could hear him shouting from the windows to the public begging people to help small businesses to whoever walked passed and most just walked on you get those who like to help people. Those were the types of people this guy was relying on and I saw how quick this guy travelled from the upstairs window to the living room and he then opened the door claiming “everyone should help small businesses will you help mine?” and the person outside asked him what his business was. The guy living inside the house claimed that he offered funeral services to the dead and the guy was interested and offered to spread his leaflets. The person went inside the house and then the door slammed shut on its own. There was an eerie silence and one which I didn’t like and when I went up to the window, once again I saw a vampire sucking on a persons neck. You can see the hunger on the vampire and the desperation and it was disgusting. No mercy was shown to the victim and it was simple savagery and where did these creatures come from. My whole reality and everything I had ever believed in was now totally different and I couldn’t sleep and not because I was homeless but because I couldn’t get these images from out of my mind.

The second vampire saw me and instantly knew what I was and that I was the new owner of the outside world. He came to the door in such speed with his victim still shaking on the floor and the vampire nicely begged me “invite me into your house” meaning the outside world so he can do his thing onto others. I simply said no to him and the desperation in his eyes was clear because he was definitely sick of being stuck inside a house. He wanted to get out and be free to do what he wanted and he then said to me “being homeless is hard how long can you keep it up and you will eventually end up like the old man who had this job before you” and I tried to ignore him but the reality was setting in.

The reality of being homeless was now plaguing my mind so vividly and maybe regretting doing this job in the first place. I shouldn’t have been tempted by the money and its so cliché isn’t it how we all do things for money by putting out health and mind at risk for a payday. The money didn’t seem worth it anymore and as I walked away from the second vampire begging me to let him into my house, I was just thinking about myself now. I everyone knows how to leave a job but I didn’t know how to leave this one and whether I had to give a notice or if I could just walk away.

Being homeless was hard and dangerous especially during the weekend when drunks would fight with me and when other homeless people would steal my stuff. Violence was ripe and drugs was everywhere this was a horrible job and I didn’t know how my predecessor had done it for so long right into old age. I was forbidden from even staying in a place for more than an hour but there were places for me to shower and get clean. These place were only for me and I only had an hour that I could clean myself and eat some food and then I had to get out. Every 3 days I was allowed to go this place.

After being homeless even the most basic of places is just heaven and we all take for granted for having a roof over our heads. I wondered what would happen if I stayed in a place for over an hour and how would my employers even know? They didn’t even have cctv cameras to check up on me and I was getting sick of being homeless. I was getting sick of the treatment from the public and what I do for them to not being attacked by two vampires living in their area. Some of them I would have loved to lure them to either of the two vampires.

Majority of the public don’t deserve protecting and they deserve the worst and to be thrown into the pit with wolves. How horrid people are and how terrible they can be, but some are just lovely. These are the people who bring food and other necessities for the homeless and they listen to our stories and show us support even sit next to us when we aren’t even smelling right. Its these types of people who remind me who we are protecting and this gives me faith that humanity is not always so bad.

I went to the first vampires house where he was shouting out of his window about how he wants to be robbed. He was making stuff up how he tried to make his house so lovely and only by getting robbed can he fully know that his house actually lovely because burglars only rob lovely well fashioned houses. Just like clockwork two more thuggish looking men were interested in robbing the first vampires house and I tried to warn them but the vampire called me “get lost you homeless hobo” and when I tried to deter the two thuggish looking men they started to intimidate me and told me to get lost. My anger allowed them two to go and try to rob the first vampires house and I witnessed them both being dragged by the vampire. They shouted and screamed and the vampire had his thirst quenched by their blood. I then stood outside his house and the vampire smiled at me and said “how is being homeless is it getting to you yet, why don’t you just invite me to your house” and I said no to him.

He then started to question my morals and why I let the two men into his house and I tried to explain to the vampire that they didn’t want my help. The vampire then told me that I allowed them into his house and that I could have called the police or even tried fighting them a little bit. He even told me how my predecessor use to fight with people to stop them going into either of the vampires houses. It was clear I was weaker or of lesser morals and the first vampire said that I could just bring people to his house instead and he would never have the need to go outside.
I walked away in shame and I felt so bad for what I had done and it was horrid weather and I couldn’t stand being inside. I needed some kind of shelter and I was so desperate that I decided to let go inside a hotel for a bit. I sat in the waiting area and bought myself some coffee and nodded off and 3 hours went by and then I started getting a call and it was my employer. He shouted at me for staying inside a place for more than an hour and he explained to me that if I stay inside a place for more than an hour, the vampires will be able to go out further away from their house. I didn’t know this and I quickly went outside and visited the second vampires house.

The second vampire was now able to go outside into his front yard but no further and I couldn’t believe what I had done and he had killed a few passer byes. He looked at me and said “being homeless is getting hard right. It will take time to get use to it” and I felt so ashamed and then I saw the vampire being pushed back by an invisible force back into his home. The vampire kept on saying to me “please invite me into your home” and I told him a stern no.

I then visited the first vampire’s house and he was able to go outside into his front yard because I stayed inside a place for more than an hour. Its like if I stay inside a place for more than an hour its like whatever force is keeping them trapped inside their houses becomes weaker as the outside isn’t my home anymore. The first vampire was laughing his head off and he killed so many passer byes and my employer sorted out the dead bodies and clearing any evidence by employing a special cleaning team.

“I told you homelessness will get to you” the first vampire told me

The first vampire was now trapped inside his home and I was getting told off by my employer and I admitted to my employer that I was now having second thoughts about this job. I didn’t think that I had it in me to do it at all. My employer refused to listen to me at all and told me to just get on my job and I didn’t want to do it anymore. All I could do that night was find a bench to sleep in and I even got woken up by another homeless person who robbed my bag which had clothes and other necessities inside the bad and I just lost it. I screamed in anger as I couldn’t take it anymore and then a group of drunks came up to me and started shoving me. The shoved me to the ground laughing at me and calling me all sorts of name and humiliating me because I am homeless.

All I could do was get up and walk away but seething in anger and yes there are good people but not enough of them in my opinion. I decided to invite both vampires into my home and I went up to both of them to each of their homes and invited them back into the outside world. They both disappeared and a string of brutal killings followed. My employer and his company had all but disappeared. I do feel bad but at least I’m not homeless anymore.

I tried to tell my family and friends about where I was and what I had done and the things I had seen. Nobody believed and they all kept pulling me down for being useless and now they want my mental health checked. I am sick of everyone and I wanted to prove it. After trying to search for vampire during the night all on my one, I was even prepared to become one and even seeing the company that hired me coming back into the light.
I was prepared to do all of this to prove my friends and family that they were all wrong about me. Then I met brad during the middle of the night who promised to turn me into a vampire, but When am I supposed to turn into a vampire? I met Brad who is a vampire and he said that he will make me a vampire by biting me. Right now Brad has been biting me and I haven't turned into a vampire yet. I really want to be a vampire so that I could kill my friends and family, but Brad tells me that it could take a couple of bites before i turn into a vampire. I can't wait till I turn into a vampire and everything will be wonderful. I will roam the nights as I love nights and I can fly, shape shift and do as I please.

I am aware of the limitations that vampires have like sunlight and garlic but I will adapt. Brad is trying to bite me harder but all I get is more pain. I get really low when I still don't get to be like a vampire and I am trying so hard. Brad is doing his best to keep my hopes up and he told me that it took a couple of bites before he turned into a vampire. Every time I walk into the sun and I get so sad because this means that I am not a vampire. At the same time, I would love to scare those that have harmed me in the past, I plan on drinking animal blood and occasionally human, maybe someone on the death row.

Brad bit into me again but no vamperic changes again, and I am losing hope, and he tells me to be patient and I am losing the will to carry on. All these bite marks all over my body they don't look good at all, and especially on my neck. I think I might have gotten an infection from Brad from all the biting and this made me happy because it shows something is happening. I have so much trust in Brad but one day something happened which destroyed my dreams.

I spotted Brad biting someone else and after Brad bit him, that person went off running, I went up to that person and I assumed he too wanted to be a vampire. This person said he desired to be a zombie and that Brad was a zombie. I told him that Brad was a vampire and that he was trying to make me one, but after many bites, it's just not happening. Me and this guy had similar experiences and neither of us have turned into what we wanted to be after being bitten by brad, and we both decided to confront Brad. When we both confronted Brad, Brad just started laughing and admitted that he wasn't a vampire or a zombie, that he just likes biting people.
Then he bit the guy who wanted to be a zombie, and actually took a chunk of flesh out of his neck and blood started spraying out. I started running with Brad laughing manically. Brad is just crazy. I’m never going to prove my family wrong and that I was telling the truth.

I can more or less trace serious diarrhea back to a dairy product these days. But, this is leaving me more in the camp of constipation now.

I still exist in the never ending vicious cycle of diarrhea and constipation because of getting dairied. I try my best not to use Imodium to stop it because it just makes it worse later. I’ve been trying my best to avoid dairy and keep regular but this has always been a struggle for me.

Lately, I’ve been using Miralax on and off. I try to do it every other day because otherwise I get diarrhea. I teach and I am home for break right now. Every 2-3 days, I’ve been having these rather large bowel movements that are mostly complete (I do have pelvic floor issues) but they leave me feeling crampy and scraped out. A very sensitive, tender feeling internally. I feel like diarrhea is coming after but it doesn’t. This is an improvement to the past because diarrhea would follow it for the whole day.

The most aggressive ones are after I take Miralax with my coffee. But I don’t think it’s the coffee because I drink it during the day at work with no effects. What’s going on here?",1,1735149926.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1hm5ilr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/1hm5ilr/christmas_with_kids/,Christmas with kids,"Looking for help from parents with dspd. I’m a normie with a sleep schedule ideally from 10/11pm-7am. Husband has dspd and sleeps from 4/5am-1pm. I take his dspd seriously. It took ten years for him to get that diagnosis and we have made major changes in the last two years to accommodate his sleeping needs. He quit his decade long union job and I’m the main breadwinner. I force myself to stay up late to spend time with him (typically going to bed around 2am and I don’t plan things before noon if I can help it. But our son keeps daylight hours. It means I’m doing most of the parenting and household things during the day alone. I don’t love it but it’s life. Christmas tho is a challenge. Simply put, today sucked. 

Both husband and I went to bed around 2 since we knew it would be an early start. Son woke at 7am (which personally I think is really good on Christmas-I was waking my parents at 5am when I was little). I made our son SLOW down his morning and he waited until 7:30 when excitement took over and he just couldn’t wait anymore. I spent another half hour making him brush his teeth and getting coffee and tried to wake my husband as gently as possible. He wouldn’t wake. It was 8, and our son was beyond excited but husband wouldn’t get up. I finally got him up and we opened stockings. He fell asleep again during the 12 minutes it took to serve breakfast. We ate without him and I tried to entertain our son until 9ish when he was begging for presents. I ended up yelling at my husband until he woke enough to barely make it through presents before he fell asleep under the tree. So now it’s 1 and we’ve played with half the toys. Husband is still a decorative feature under our Christmas tree and I’m frustrated and exhausted. 

I am typically sympathetic to husband’s plight. I get it. It sucks to be off cycle from the world, but he’s still a parent. Santa comes in the morning, not the afternoon. It’s really unfair for him to have to wait hours and hours to touch his presents and husband would be heartbroken if we opened them without him. All other Christmas activities have been moved to afternoon/evening hours but I just don’t know how to move Christmas morning as it’s something we used to do when husband was attempting normie hours and now our son is excited and expectant on Christmas morning. 

He’s known about this all year-it’s not a surprise. He had the option to stay up all night. I offered to let him nap all day if he could just rally for a couple hours. I know it’s hard but I travel for work and sometimes I have to wake at 3/4am for a flight. I’ve nursed a baby at 2am or gotten up at 5am to take care of a sick kiddo. Kids force you to do things on their timeline. Am I wrong? Is this an issue I created unwittingly? I want all of us to be happy. I don’t want Christmas to have yelling. Once our son is out of the home, we can have Christmas at whatever time suits us but I don’t think it’s too much to ask for a few years of him accommodating our son’s schedule like we’ve accommodated his. But maybe I’m being needlessly difficult. So what do you dspd parents do? Do you suck it up and wake early for Santa like I’m clearly expecting or have you found another option that works better? 

TL;DR: husband has dspd and we have a young child at home and i can’t tell if im being unreasonable asking husband to wake early one day a year to accommodate Christmas spirit. ",1,1735149628.0,DSPD,0,1.0,False

My stbex husband and I have been married for a long time but we're going to get divorced soon. We've had our fair share of fights here and there, which is, normal for any couple, but he is the type of men who complains alot, make a ton of demands, and rarely does he acknowledge me or include me in big decisions.

Things have been bad between us already, but it got worse when he got his diagnosis (he's suffering from medical condition). While I sympathized with his condition, I knew this was gonna be the end of our marriage. I knew I could not handle this version of him with his condition and all.

So I was very honest with him, and told him that i wanted divorce. He was both open to it yet resentful towards me (but he's been for a while now, so, yeah). We agreed to tell the kids after Christmas and just be together as a family and enjoy the Holidays.
Well, he wanted to be petty and get back at me, but I didn't think he'd go to such length. In the morning when our kids (they're 13 & 15 btw) opened their Christmas presents, they were shocked to find out their dad and I are getting divorced. Their dad printed this on paper and put the papers in their gift boxes. It was horrible. Especially the way he worded it ""Merry Christmas, Your mom is divorcing me"". The house turned into a crying mess. He wasn't even there, he went to get coffee or whatever. He knew what was gonna happen (thus he left the house in the morning)...I didn't know what to do, I tried my best to get them to calm down then called mom. He came and I absolutely blew up at him and called him ""fucking psycho"" for doing this to the kids, on Christmas no less. He defended himself saying I ""was no better"" for ""deciding"" to end our marriage right after his diagnosis. I told him it was more because of his awful character then anything else. but he has tainted my image to the kids as they now think I'm leaving him for his condition, and refused to speak to me.

It got out and inlaws got involved. He told everyone I called him a psycho and yelled at him for telling the kids the truth. They all came at me, especially his mother who hated me all those years for no apparent reason. She called me a betch and said that if my relationship with the kids is ruined then it'd because of my own doing, and I have no one to blame but myself for being such an awful wife and mother. It escalated. He's moving out and the kids are with mom. I'm feeling utterly devastated right now but started to think that my outburst was unnecessary and calling him psycho and causing a scene instead of de-escalating the situation.",6,1735149232.0,AITAH,9,0.88,False

Two feverish dreams, pushing precariously close to release of the seeds. Free from all medications except a bit of sugar at Xmas dinner, a bit of carbs, and moderate caffeine this morn. My physical brain actually felt pain, despite no nerve endings in there, maybe a psychosomatic response to the stress of working to think my way out of allowing the dream to produce a physical reaction. This time of year is especially challenging with racing thoughts and shame based feelings of low self-worth and wasted time and talents.

Lewis reminded me that God does not work on the same time scale and fixes problems outside the realm of human reason and understanding. He often restores the ""gap years"" of missed opportunities and ""falling behind"" with miraculous redemptive restorations.  Sometimes I day dream, today I am ""dry dreaming"".

But this year, we wrapped the kids' presents all in the same wrapping paper and put them out after the kids went to bed last night. After waking me up and drag me downstairs at 6am so they can look at their stash, I'm sitting there drinking my coffee and the youngest says to me, ""Dad, did you get Santa's presents?""

Me, still not fully awake: ""What do you mean?""

7y/o: ""Our presents are wrapped in the same paper as Santa's presents. Did you get them?""

Me, on alert but still not functioning properly: ""Well, what do you think happened?""

7y/o: ""I think you got them. Is Santa real?""

Now at this point I know I'm screwed. While I don't mind fudging answers on occasion, or not answering completely, or leaving things out, I do believe that direct questions require direct answers.

Me: ""We got the presents, Santa isn't real.""

7y/o, with tears gathering in her big blue eyes, ""I can't believe you let me think Santa was real.""

Me, feeling the sting of her disappointment: ""Do you want a hug?""

7y/o: ""No, I need to be alone for a moment."" And she walks off, head hung down, and goes into another room and shuts the door. I can hear her weeping quietly as my heart hurts.

\--- The story itself



""You know, if you make that face so long it'll be stuck like that.""



Theo would force his face to be like this forever anyways. He was offended at what he was seeing.



""Mornin', I made some bacon and eggs..."" Theo told her passively, still scowling at the article he had read. 'Lux Machina' wasn't renewed for another season. But Bigmouth got a hundredth and fifth season! Whoever made this decision needed to be beheaded in the street yesterday.



The old woman with dyed red hair walked over to where he sat. A cushioned set of chairs around a table. Their dining room, somewhat connected to a kitchen.



""I can't eat that shit."" she said as she starred hungrily at the pile of bacon. Then plopped down across from him.



She was nearly 80, but modern medicine is a marvel. She moved with a spryness and sass of someone decades younger. Her skin, hair, all of it defied her age.



""If you took your pills you could."", she shook her head. ""Nah, They make my head all weird."" his grandmother pointed at her temples and made circles.



""You don't say..."" he barely looked up from his phone at her. 



But she slapped him on the shoulder and he to fumbled it. ""Careful! This is the latest model!"" Theo shielded his phone from the dangerous offender.



She scoffed at him- ""Every year they come out with one! I remember when I was your age, they were in the single digits!""



""This is the Iphone 'Odyssey'. Thank you very much."" he gestured to it grandly.



She laughed.



Which, after a moment- caused him to laugh. Sometimes he felt like the grandparent. 



Samantha Lemont, renowned photographer. Mostly retired.



They were in her apartment - if you could call it that. It was a building many people lived in, but each one was the size of a house. Grand.



He moved in when he lost his job a few months ago. Not that it was his fault. It was automated. Damned robots.



""Odyssey- they make it sound like an adventure! That marketing department I swear..."" she sprung forward energetically- ""Marketing!"" She framed hard hands in front of her as if she was pitching an idea.



""Marketing, never changes."" she said seriously.



""Is that some kind of reference or something?"" Theo asked.



""Your generation suuuucks."" she deflated into her cushioned seat. Head lulling back.



Theo just shook his head and sighed. Scrolling down the article, apparently the showrunners of 'Lux Machina' were holding out hope someone else would pick up the series for another season.



\*Ting-Tingaling\*



The padding of little feet come into the room.



A little Pomeranian puffball starred at the two, a tiny bell hanging from her neck.



""What?"" Theo asked. But she just starred at the two expectantly. ""Outside?"", she tilted her head. ""Foo-?"" The dog peed.



""Wha- No! Bad dog! No!"", Theo went to chastise her. 



His grandmother stopped him; ""Don't you tell at her!"", ""She's ruining the floor! This place costs like a billion dollars!"", ""It's laminated hardwood! She's a dog! And besides... The drone will get it.""



The two argued as the dog padded off to cause trouble elsewhere, seemingly satisfied.



After arguing for awhile longer, Theo accepted defeat. Sighing and frustrated.



""Forget it. Let's go for a walk."", he said. Immediately Samantha deflated again into her cushion, head lulling back. ""Don't wanna.""



""Come on, there's a nice sprinkle out there, let's go see the park. Maybe Ed will be playing chess again?""



""No."", she was adamant. It was early morning, but that's the best time for her. Theo pinched the ridge of his nose. ""What if we passed by the game store?""



She looked up from the cushioned seat.



\---



So there they were. After a brief trip to the park, they had made their way to the game shop.



""Ed was cranky today."" Theo said listlessly as he examined some of the games on the shelves.



There was a resurgence of this kind of thing, 'physical copies' were once again a thing.



See- a few online platforms rescinded ownership of some products and now people wanted physical evidence of ownership. And other legal stuff. So now, you had to buy these.



""It's cause you mentioned the games. I told you not to. I had to listen to Ed explain for the millionth time; 'Chess never gets an update or a patch! That's a real game, back from when people finished things!' bah!""



She said that, but she herself was an adept chess player. Board games were apart of her gaming obsession. She even hosted DnD campaigns with some of the other seniors in the building.



The woman was excitedly browsing as she explained how video games were very bit as valid as chess. ""Oooh\~ saucy. Hey Theo, look at this.""



""No."" he said instantly. The old woman grimaced. ""Look."" she pushed the game in front of him but he turned his head.



""I'll guess. Is it a dating sim?"", ""Nope."", ""Sex thing in anyway?"", ""You're no fun. - I Can't believe they just put this on the shelves.""



Theo grabbed up a game. ""What about this one? You play as a cop. Hey- they haven't automated that yet-"" before he finished his sentence his grandmother was snickering.



""What? I could be a cop!"", ""Sure, sure."" they browsed awhile longer, Theo liked games but he wasn't as enamored as his grandmother.



He wanted to DO something real. But what could he do? 90% of work is done by robots. Welfare is so good a person could live in dignity on it. But it didn't give a person purpose or meaning.



He was thinking of jobs and work when he saw it.



A grand display. An advertisement centered in the large store magnificiently.



A knight in shining armor stood with a sword impaling stone, the words; ""The Real Fantasy"" scrawled across the bottom in a regal old english font.



""That's a bit... On this nose?"" Theo said looking at the white platform it stood on. There were pictures and descriptions of gameplay features.



'Live in a land of fantasy! Be a bard, a tavern keeper! A king or a peasant! Live out your fantasy dream in the first REAL fantasy!'



""Whow! Look at those graphics - it looks so real! And this is a VR game? Theo- VR games can't do this yet."" she said studiously as she flipped through a pamphlet that came from the display.



""Looks like this one does."" Theo said, looking for actual gameplay, but there were no actual displays. Like screens.



""Oh, I see. This is new!"" she slapped the page in the pamphlet. ""No wonder it's so generic! It's made by the company that made the new VR system, it launches with it!"" she showed him the pamphlet and Theo took it.



'The Real Fantasy', developed inhouse by the neurolink team using generative artificial intelligence. 



Theo perused the pages, getting the gist of it.



Instead of using graphics cards, ram, and all these things, the system transmits directly to the brain using precise arcs of electricity and nano-technology to utilize the brains natural sensory capabilities to generate an environment indistinguishable from reality. Which connected to a private internet source provided by the company.



An environment with cities and questlines generated by A.i. which studied every fantasy accessible.



Before he got to the next section of the pamphlet his grandmother snatched it back. ""This- I was worried I would die before getting to see it..."" her eyes were glistening with held back tears.



""I wouldn't get too excited... Sounds too good to be true."" he said.



She looked at him with an ire. ""Don't spit on my dreams. I'm buying this.""



Other people were noticing the commotion and approaching it now. Some of them seemed almost as excited as Theos grandmother. ""Mom I want it!"", ""I don't know, it seems violent.""



""You'd think something like this would have some kind of use besides video games... Why are we hearing about it now? And where was the advertising for it?"" Theo was puzzled.



""You can stand here all day and think about it. I'm going home and getting weird with this."" she held the pamphlet close to her chest as she walked to one of the many store clerks.



""One of these please.""



\---



The headset was... Massive. To say the least. It was like wearing a cat-scan on your head. It was on wheels, and the person had to lay down to get in it.



No wonder they didn't have a trial system at the store, they had to get it delivered like a piano. The deliverymen were anxious to leave as quickly as possible - who knows how many orders they were getting...



""Grandma... I think I should test it first. What if it has a weird affect on old people brains?"", she just gave him a coy look in response-  ""Pfft, no way! I'm living the rest of my life in this thing! Look, it says right here; 'FDA approved'!"" slapping a sticker on the side of the giant 1980's styled microwave helmet.



The fact that the FDA had to approve a video game console alone made Theo anxious, but he felt that his grandmother might actually attack him if he showed any more skepticism.



They wheeled it over to a bed in one of the guest rooms. So that a person could lay with their head hanging from the bed and... Slot themselves in?



""There are over twenty playable races! Though half of them seem anthropomorphic. Kinky."" she had the game manual and was studying it.



""How do you uh... 'Do it'?"", Theo was looking at the entrance to it. It was heavily padded.



""It says right here just push your head in and say 'Game start'."" She slapped the book closed and tossed it on a dresser.



""I still think we should wait for reviews and stuff."" Theo was still worried, this thing could scramble brains if it could simulate realities...



""Stop being such a worrywort! I've seen gameplay, people have uploaded it! Though, there's this weird privacy thing where you can't share gameplay footage until you're outside the game... Again- kinky. Me likey."" she giddily pulled the machine towards her head.



Theo couldn't believe how willing she was, but before he knew it the machine hummed to life and she said; ""Don't wait up for me! Game start!"".



Her body went still, hand flopping onto the mattress. 



""Grandma!"" he grabbed her hand frantically- but he felt a pulse. ""Oh... Yeah. But still- that's freaky as hell."" it did clearly say it would render the user immobile. In the same way sleep paralysis did, apparently. But it would awake the user if certain conditions are met.



Theo wished he could see her gameplay to make sure everything was alright, but beside some displays on the outside of the machine showing heartrate and things, he had no way of knowing what she was doing.



\---



After a few hours, he started to get antsy. Of course, she was just enjoying the game he was sure. Theo did browse some gameplay, and it was reality bending to see.



There were different trends, like messing with the NPCs that used machine learning to remember players and react to them dynamically.



One player stole an apple from a vendor and ran down the street only to be clotheslined by a guard who was expecting his behavior. His friends laughing at him as they jailed him.



The organic quest system, the way property worked - it was all so complex but worked seamlessly. The Ai set it up and let it run wild. Like a little contained world.



Though of course, it wasn't little at all, the size and scope of it dwarfed the actual Earth.



It was getting late, Theo was getting worried and so he went to press the failsafe button on the machine.



She could yell at him all she wanted, he just had to make sure.



""Sorry Grandma, just a quick break..."" He pressed the button.



""Grandma?"" He pressed it again. ""You awake yet?""



'Oh shit.' he scrambled for the book and opened it. Frantically flipping through it he came upon the page about leaving the game.



The player could say 'Fantasy Game Off' or select from a drop down menu but from the outside the failsafe button was supposed to disconnect them.



As well as jostling their body a lot like waking them from a dream.



He had tried both.



He started to hyperventilate. ""No... No.."", he called 911.



'All available lines are occupied, please remain on the line and if you have a medical emergency-'



""FUCK!"", he tossed the phone across the room.



Theo ran over to the TV in the corner of the room and turned it over to the news. A beautiful latina in a dress suit appeared.



""-illions of players are currently comatose and trapped inside of the product. Legal representatives of Neurolink claims they're not aware of what's causing the issue and are working desperately to fix it, authorities are pressing them on the issue but unfortunately they're the only ones that understand the technology enough to rectify it.""



Another news anchors voice chimed in; ""What does this mean if users are stuck in for several hours, or even days? Can't we just pull them out?""



The woman flipped through her papers nervously and then brought a hand up to a ear piece, nodding and listening then saying;



""Neurolink enterprises claims that they can fix the bug before anything like that, but if necessary, they're covering the medical costs of anyone who is trapped for so long as they need medical attention. As for 'pulling them out', well- they say that if the failsafe isn't working that it likely won't trigger in any case meaning...""



""They'll be comatosed."", ""Yes. And possibly worse.""



The remote clattered to the ground from Theos hands.



He looked back at his grandmother, tears in his eyes. He grabbed one of her hands into his and held it gently. Feeling the warmth to remind himself, she's probably having the time of her life in there.



\---



Neurolink didn't fix the bug, and people became skeptical if they ever would after the first few days.



As hundreds of thousands of people around the country were put into hospitals. The huge visors being wheeled in alongside their IV drips.



Theo sat next to his grandma. She was wealthy herself, and with the Neurolinks medical compensation, she afforded one of the most advanced facilities for comatose patients.



He shuddered at the thought of the people who were shuttled into the warehouses instead.



A knock at their door- a nurse stood there. Joyce, a large woman with dark hair and hazel eyes.



""Hey..."" She spoke gently, ""Do you need anything? Coffee?""



Theo wiped at his face, embarrassed. ""Uh, no thank you. How much longer are visiting hours?"" He forgot how long he's sat here. Studying his phone for any progress on fixing... Whatever this is.



""No worries. You have a few more hours."" Theo nodded, and she turned to leave but stopped- ""I'm so sorry... This is all so strange and terrible..."" she seemed unsure what to say- she had a bit of anger in her eyes, despite how sullenly she said it.



Theo felt that same anger, everyone did.



""It is."" is all he said. Fury smoldering in his eyes as he starred at the machine.



\---



Theo was on his phone the next day. New cracks running along the screen.



""So you didn't use it? Great! I can't find them anywhere-""



\*Ting-aling\*



Theo was feeding Princess. She starred up at him from the food, offended. He didn't know what she usually ate. Samantha did.



Probably something fancy, but for now, she got wet dog food and that was fancy for most. But evidently, not for Princess.



""I don't care, I'll pay four times!"" apparently many people had the same idea he did.



If you can't fix it from the outside... Maybe you can on the inside.



""Alright Alright! Relax Theo- it's your funeral. Like I said, the police tried to reclaim it. And I got a bunch of offers from other people, I don't know how they figured out I have it! I would say I don't need the money, with your grandmother being laid up and all that but... I'm not doing too great, like financially. After buying this thing.""



""It's no problem, Samantha can afford it.""



Getting it to the apartment would be a problem. And then alerting authorities to pick him up, it's all a crazy plan.



But his grandmother was in his corner when he needed her, he couldn't let her waste away in there.



He rented a moving truck instead and set it up in there. The VR machines had a temporary battery you could charge, almost as if they planned for this eventuality...



It was like a shady back alley deal how it went down. He backed up to his friends house, in the suburbs outside the big city and loaded it up.



His heart was in his throat as he looked at the thing - but he couldn't procrastinate long. His friend would be calling the police soon to tell them about this 'mysterious van'.



""...How will I even find her? If we're all trapped in there, how does it work?"" he couldn't know. The game only let you share gameplay after disconnecting, and no one has disconnected for days.



He took a breath of real air, then slotted his head into the bulky device. ""Fuck me... Game start.""",2,1735147801.0,ProgressionFantasy,0,0.75,False

After extensive research i pulled the trigger and ordered a dinamica plus about a month ago.
When it finally arrived, I set it up and ran the initial water cycle step, the pump ran, but no water was going into the machine. It kept asking to start the water cycle step, but the same thing happened and I couldn't move on from there. I called DeLonghi support who said it's needed to be sent in for service. Once they finished the analysis they told me it was not user error. The distributor offered a refund or replacement. I chose a replacement. 
The new one finally arrived just before Christmas, and what do you know: it has the exact same issue!

I was really keen on this machine after all my research and people seeming happy with it, but lost faith in the quality of the brand after this debacle.

So I om wondering if anyone may have suggestions for an alternative? 

Currently i have my eyes set on the Nivona NICR 820, it seems people are happy with it, but very few actually have it.

My requirements are: 

• Max 800€ (I'm in Denmark)
• Can make black coffee, cappuccino and latte
Preferably silent grinder
• Self cleaning milk frothing system (and easy to clean) 
• Reliable

Anyone do Orangetheory? ,"First of all, happy holidays. I am not a religious person and don’t want to be dramatic but I am coming out of denial and this has put the fear of God in me to make the changes needed to live as long as possible. I have a bucket list that requires a good quality of life. I am 54F and am of the belief that people should at least live to be 70. 

My recent GFR (still learning what that’s all about) came in at 3b level. My PCP asked how hydrated I had been and wanted to repeat the test in a week or so, and this time refrain from having any coffee before the draw. Have had two more tests showing GFR at 57 and 58. 

Over the holidays spending time with family I have been reading all about CKD and how best to manage it, and am trying not to beat myself up for taking my good health for granted in the past. I have been all too fond of wine and weed and the foods they say we now need to avoid. I have not been a fan of pill regimens so I lapsed on managing my high blood pressure and am now paying the price. I have always been able to eat whatever I want and get minimal to no exercise while maintaining a healthy weight until this past year when I got farther into perimenopause and am now 20 pounds overweight for the first time in my life. Until now I have been in denial that I wouldn’t always be healthy and fit without exercising and while consuming whatever I wanted whether it was healthy or not. I was unprepared to find myself a somewhat older adult with health challenges but here I am. 

I now realize that if I want to live as long as possible with the best possible quality of life, it is imperative that I eat right and exercise. I’ve tried various gyms in the past but I don’t enjoy them so it’s hard to stay motivated. I used to go hiking with friends before Covid but my social life has dried up since then. I have become isolated except for my SO but now I know I could use some support for the radical New Year’s resolutions I must make ASAP. 

TLDR: They say Orangetheory is an exercise program in a supportive environment. Has anyone tried it? If not, how did you go about getting more exercise if you’re not a fan of it? And making the other lifestyle changes? How has it worked for you?",1,1735147671.0,kidneydisease,1,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for overall well-being. Understanding how much water you should drink daily can significantly impact your health, energy levels, and overall productivity. Water plays a vital role in almost every bodily function, from regulating temperature to keeping your joints lubricated.

Knowing the right amount of water can help you avoid dehydration. Dehydration can cause various symptoms like fatigue, headache, and even constipation. So, how do you figure out how much you should drink? Here are the key factors to consider:

- **Body Weight:** One common guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for about 75 ounces of water daily.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise regularly or engage in strenuous activities, you may need more water. It's crucial to replenish what you lose through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather makes you sweat more, which means your body requires extra hydration. If you live in a hot area, be sure to drink additional water.
- **Diet:** Foods high in water content, like fruits and vegetables, can contribute to your daily intake. If your diet lacks these foods, you might need to drink more water.

Understanding these factors can help you tailor your water intake based on your lifestyle. Here are some top benefits of incorporating enough water into your daily routine:

- **Set Reminders:** Use smartphone apps or alarms to remind you to take a sip every hour. This can help establish a routine where drinking water becomes habitual.
- **Monitor Your Urine:** A simple way to gauge hydration is by checking the color of your urine. Light yellow indicates proper hydration, while dark yellow suggests dehydration.

When you think about hydration, you may focus on physical benefits, often overlooking its importance for cognitive function. Understanding how much water you should drink daily can play an essential role in sharpening your mind.

Your brain is composed of about 75% water. This high percentage means that hydration directly influences your brain's performance. When you are well-hydrated, your brain can operate at its best, leading to sharper thinking and better decision-making. On the other hand, even mild dehydration can result in fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and mood changes. Here’s how staying properly hydrated can boost your mental clarity:

### Enhanced Focus and Concentration

Water plays a vital role in maintaining your focus. Dehydration can lead to distraction and diminish your ability to concentrate. Research indicates that being even slightly dehydrated can impair tasks that require attention. To stay focused and alert, it’s essential to drink enough water throughout the day.

### Improved Memory Function

Hydration is not just important for your current focus; it also significantly impacts memory retention and recall. Studies show that individuals who drink adequate amounts of water perform better on memory tests compared to those who are dehydrated. Whether you’re studying for an exam or need to remember key details at work, staying hydrated can help bolster your memory.

### Reduced Brain Fog

Have you ever felt sluggish or mentally cloudy during the day? This brain fog can often be traced back to hydration levels. When you’re dehydrated, your brain has to work harder, leading to that foggy feeling. Drinking enough water can help clear the mental haze, promoting a more alert and lively mental state.

### Better Mood and Stress Management

Your brain’s functioning and emotional well-being are intertwined. Dehydration can heighten feelings of anxiety and stress. Staying hydrated not only supports cognitive functions but also helps balance your mood. When your brain is well-hydrated, it releases neurotransmitters more efficiently, which can improve your overall mental health.

Pushing your hydration needs to the sidelines can affect your brain’s efficiency and overall performance. In addition to the quantity, focus on the quality of water you consume. Clean, filtered water is best, as it ensures that you’re doing your body and brain a favor without risking exposure to harmful chemicals.

One common question arises: ""How much water should I drink?"" While the general guideline is about eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, individual needs can vary.

Common Myths About Water Intake: What You Need to Know
------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our health, yet many people hold onto misconceptions about how much to drink. Understanding the truth about water intake is crucial for maintaining optimal health and wellness. Let’s tackle some common myths surrounding water consumption.

### Myth 1: You Need Eight Glasses of Water a Day

This is perhaps the most widely believed myth. While eight 8-ounce glasses, often referred to as the ""8x8"" rule, can be a good guideline, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Individual water needs can vary based on factors such as:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Activity Level:** More physically active individuals typically require more fluids.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather increases your need for hydration.
- **Diet:** Foods high in water, like fruits and vegetables, can contribute to overall hydration.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain illnesses or medications may require adjustments in intake.

Instead of fixating on a specific number, pay attention to your body’s thirst signals and drink accordingly.

### Myth 2: All Beverages Count Toward Your Daily Water Intake

Although any fluid contributes to hydration, it’s essential to recognize that some beverages are better than others. Coffee and tea can be hydrating, but drinks high in sugar, like sodas, and those containing caffeine may lead to dehydration. It's best to prioritize water and other healthy options when aiming to stay hydrated.

### Myth 3: Thirst Is Always a Sign of Dehydration

Thirst is a natural signal from your body that it needs fluids, but it doesn’t always indicate you're already dehydrated. In fact, many people might drink water only when they feel thirsty. To ensure proper hydration, consider drinking water regularly throughout the day, even if you don't feel particularly thirsty. water breaks can be an effective strategy to develop a consistent hydration habit.

### Myth 4: Clear Urine Means You Are Perfectly Hydrated

While clear urine can indicate good hydration, it’s not the sole indicator of your body's hydration status. Factors such as the food you eat and your health can influence urine color. Pale yellow urine is typically a sign of adequate hydration, while dark yellow or amber urine can indicate the need for more fluids.

### Myth 5: Drinking Water Can Help You Lose Weight

While staying hydrated is vital for overall health and can support weight loss efforts, drinking water alone is not a miracle solution for shedding pounds. However, replacing high-calorie drinks with water can help decrease calorie intake. Additionally, drinking water before meals may help you feel fuller, potentially leading to smaller portion sizes.

### Myth 6: If You're Not Thirsty, You Don’t Need to Drink Water

Relying solely on thirst as a guide for when to drink isn’t always sufficient. Some people, especially the elderly, may not feel thirsty even when their bodies need hydration. It’s beneficial to establish a regular drinking routine and to include water-rich foods to your diet, such as watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges.

### Myth 7: You Cannot Drink Too Much Water

While hydration is vital, excessive water intake can lead to a rare but serious condition known as hyponatremia, or water intoxication. This occurs when the balance of electrolytes in your body is disrupted by an overload of water. To avoid this, ensure you are drinking water in moderation, especially during intense exercise or high temperatures.

Being aware of these common myths about water intake can empower you to make better choices for your health. Staying informed will help you maintain proper hydration and optimize your overall well-being. So, grab that water bottle, and listen to your body as you strive to find a healthy balance!

### Conclusion

Staying properly hydrated is essential not just for your physical health but also for your mental well-being. Understanding how much water you should drink daily empowers you to make informed choices that enhance both your body and mind. Proper hydration plays a crucial role in maintaining physical energy, aiding digestion, and promoting overall bodily functions, which together create a solid foundation for an active lifestyle.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1hm4k90,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hm4k90,The great poop mystery of 2024,"Hi there! Apologies in advance as this may be a long post. The TLDR is that my 11 y/o 95lb tortoise stopped producing poop like she normally does but kept eating and being active. Several vet visits and thousands of dollars later she’s pooped but still not regular. We declined exploratory surgery involving a plastronotomy - did we make the right choice? 

So back in October, we went to my brother’s wedding and were gone all day. The next day we noticed that a large chunk of styrofoam had blown into the yard and there were clear bite marks in it. I started watching our tortoise to make sure she passed the styrofoam. She lives in her own heated shed in the yard full time. We live in a northern state, so in the winter she has to stay in her shed most of the time, only coming out if it’s not raining/not too cold. She lives in hay and the occasional carrot or lettuce head in the winter, grass and water melon rinds in the summer. We do have a couple of plum trees in the yard and I know she gets after them when they fall. Normally not many of them fall as I’m out harvesting them every year, but this year we went on an Extended trip outside of the country about when they were ripe and I don’t think our housesitters did much with them beyond letting the squirrels and birds (and tortoise) get after them. 

So anyways, I start loading her up with pumpkin (it was the season!) which she ate with gusto (I swear she ate at least two large pumpkins during that time) and after a week or so goes by where I’m hunting for doodoo around the yard, in her shed, everywhere she goes, I finally notice a few small stringy turds that clearly have styrofoam in them… they were dried out and husky when I found them - like she herself was super dehydrated. As a note on her watering situation… in the summer, I have a sprinkler on a daily timer that wets the grass she grazes on, and a kiddy pool she has access to whenever she wants. At 95lbs I don’t really try to soak her anymore. She’s heavy to lift and she just climbs out immediately when I try, unless I haul her into the house and put her in the tub (she barely fits anymore 🫠). In the winter, she has a big bowl of water in her shed. I’ve tried various vessels that actually allow her to climb in, but she’s destroyed all of them. Now we have a rubber livestock bowl that’s indestructible. 

With just coming off of summer I was surprised that her dooky looked so dry. I kept watching her to make sure she got regular again. She never did. So I took her to the vet. The morning I took her to the vet, she produced 1 small, but moist, and semi normal looking black banana. It was just small. I brought it with me to the vet. They did X-rays and were concerned that she might have a distended bowel section. They sent us home with daily soak orders, a laxative and some pain killers. Lemme tell you, I’m not like crazy old, or out of shape, but it takes both my husband and I to comfortably lift her and bring her in the house for baths. Daily bathing orders is a huge lift (😆) but we did it. Another couple of weeks go by… by this time we’re in mid November, and she still hasn’t really gone. My husband and I had plans to go out of town for our anniversary, so we opted to board her at the vet where they continued bathing her and giving her sub cutaneous fluids, and a plethora of veggies. She produced another small amount of poop in one of her baths but otherwise nothing. 

By Tuesday if the next week, it had been a month since this had all began and after everything she had eaten, only producing like 3 tiny turds in that time, and the vet was concerned that she was beginning to refuse produce at their office, the recommended that we do a CT scan and rule out any obstructions or gall bladder stones. This involved anesthesia and a not small sum of money. We went for it and were extremely frustrated with the results. Basically they came back inconclusive. There were no signs of bladder stones, no signs of obstruction, her intestines/kidneys/bladder all looked completely normal. The only issue was that everything, all of her guts/insides appeared to be raised up, pushing into her lung cavity. The vet was perplexed and did an ultrasound through her leg vents (doesn’t work through the shell) and with a very narrow/limited view, could tell that she had some egg production going, but said that the eggs didn’t explain the raised anatomy pushing into her lungs. They recommended cutting her shell open and doing an exploratory surgery to see what was going on. 

We were like, ah hell naw. We’re going into winter… that will make healing even harder on her, so we brought her home to think and figure out next steps. That was on a Wednesday. She ended up pooping the next day, and then every day for the next 6 days. Small amounts each time, but they were very juicy/wet turds (those sub cutaneous fluids did their job). I saw some pumpkin seeds come out  for the first time, so it put a bit of a time stamp on how long her digestion was taking. 

We were very against the surgery. The recovery times and risks aside, it was also going to be upwards of $10k which was untenable. I ended up calling another vet - the only other vet in our entire region with facilities large enough for her, and they suggested we do another CT scan, but this time with contrast: meaning they would inject her blood with something that would make her insides light up and allow them to get a better view in what was happening insides. So, I drove the 4 hours north with a pissy tortoise in a bin to get this done. She rewarded me with more poop about 20 min out from our destination and lemme tell you, being trapped in a truck cabin with hot shit 💩 as a passenger is a smelly affair. 

It was good she did though because they were able to test her for parasites and she was found to have them, so we’re treating her for that. That was the only good thing out of that trip though as The second ct scan was a total bust. They kept her all day and I just kinda kicked it at various coffee shops around town. Finally they the evening they called me to tell me that her shell was apparently very healthy as they were having trouble getting their machine to penetrate it. In pushing the machine to get clear images, it overheated and shut itself down. The vet said they tried everything they could including calling tech support but were unable to get the contrasted images we were hoping for. They were able to tell that there was more space in her lung cavity though, so it seemed that the bit she had gone were an improvement from where she was at the time of the first ct scan. They also said that she was a bit overweight, and I should stop feeding her veggies and get her fiber levels back up (I’d been loading her up with water veggies since this all began basically trying to give her diarrhea to get her to go). I was instructed to continue giving her the laxative, and continue the daily bathing orders until she became regular again. 

At this point, we brought her home, and gave her the laxative until we ran out. We slowly reduced her baths until now were at about 1-2 times a week. We cut off the veggie train, and she’s been eating grass/hay. Fortunately the temps have been high enough and the rain light enough for her to come out even just a little bit during the day. I’ve notice small turds here and there, but not a ton. We’re treating her for parasites. I’ve decided that so long as she remains active and eating, I’m not going to make a fuss about it. I’m just not willing to go so far as to cut her shell open to figure out what’s wrong, so unless she starts showing some serious signs of ailment, we’re keeping on with this. 

Anyone with experience larger torts here? Are we doing the right thing? How often do you bathe the bigger ones? How often is normal for poops? What about the eggs? They said they were unshelled… meaning she could still reabsorb them and not lay them… could they be a factor here? If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading my saga.

I will go on record saying the following if you are passionate about cooking in your kitchen or BBQ in your backyard how much do you spend on those appliances/pans/cookware etc ?

So if someone is cheap in those areas most likely it will transfer into coffee roasting as well. But if you like quality cookware, appliances and BBQ then this will also transfer in coffee roasting.

For example I use  Big Green Egg for BBQ, old antique cast iron from Griswold and Wagner for the kitchen and nice appliances such as Kitchen Aid mixer and a blentec blender. But since I enjoy cooking I would rather buy something that will last and I wont be upgrading all of the time. I also have a nice collection of high end Japanese and German knives for the kitchen. 

I believe the same thing applies to coffee roasting with a quality machine and beans. Like most I strtd out on a popper then very soon after went to a sr500 which was an upgrade. Then went to a Behmor 1600 plus then added an SR800 with extension tube and razzo v5 tube. I just sold the Behmor and purchased the Sandbox Smart R1 because I wanted a quality small batch drum roaster with automatic and manual controls with profile sharing.

I will probably get a Allio Bullet as my retirement gift to myself.  :)

But I say all of this to say the following. I roast for the pure enjoyment and not for any ROI. I'm a hobbyist and will remain one.

So I included all the Linkin Park Underground releases that feature music that doesn't appear on later releases, which would be *Linkin Park Underground 8-14.* I also included *A Decade Underground, Reanimation, Recharged, Xero*, and the *Hybrid Theory EP*.

Linkin Park handles demos in an interesting manner. The vast majority of their demos feature different names than their final versions, but the vast majority of those demos are *also* instrumentals, which automatically deems them as not having their titles sung. I still found these to be worthwhile of inclusion just for thoroughness. Curiously, in the case of most other bands, when they have demo tracks with different titles, the early titles are often directly taken from the lyrics, before being changed to something more abstract. Linkin Park seemingly does the opposite most of the time.

By and large, most of their discography is cut and dry. There are a few cases of the title being rephrased or being technically said in a different way. ""LIES GREED MISERY"" is unique in being the first ""dark orange"" song to show up in a long while - songs that have words from the title spread across the lyrics.

*Reanimation* provided a new and unique challenge to me. The majority of the titles of remixed songs are leet speak or nonsense versions of the original titles. I had to really think about the way I've developed my system and if it can even be applied to these sorts of song titles, but I think I found a way for them to fit in. The light green songs, those in which I stipulate that something is *technically* said, normally refer to acronyms and alternative spellings. A good example of a normal instance of this would be ""IGYEIH"" off of *From Zero,* where the title stands for ""I gave you everything I have."" This phrase is sung repeatedly throughout the song, though the acronym itself is not. Therefore I think it's fair to explain that *technically* ""IGYEIH"" isn't said, but it pretty much is.

In the case of *Reanimation* titles, I'm bending my use of the word ""technically"" a little bit. Take ""Enth E Nd,"" for example; while ""Enth E Nd"" is never sung, ""in the end"" certainly is. For this reason, I explain that *technically* it's ""in the end"" that is being sung, rather than ""Enth E Nd."" You could also say that ""Enth E Nd"" is simply an alternative way of spelling ""in the end,"" which requires less bending of my rules, though we may be bending what constitutes a valid alternative way of spelling.

Hair splitting aside, and I do love my hair splitting, there are also light orange songs on *Reanimation*, songs in which a piece of the title is found in the lyrics. This occurs in the case of ""P5hng Me A\*wy,"" seeing as ""pushes **me** away"" is sung, as well as ""Wth>You"" and ""My<Dsmbr,"" which each have ""Wth"" and ""My"" sung, respectively. 

""But wait! Given that there's no space, shouldn't 'Wth>You' be treated as one entire word?"" Yeah, I see you there. You think you're so clever, huh? Think you've found a way to call me an inconsistent hypocrite with an impractical key? Well, riddle me this: How would one pronounce "">"" or ""<"" in these contexts? Are you pronouncing these songs ""Wth greater than you?"" And I know some may claim that they are, but they're definitely not actually doing that. I think it's much more helpful to think of these as alternative spaces, or at the very least, unpronounceable characters. A better example of what this might look like would be with ""\[Riff Raff\]"" and similar songs, in which the brackets preceding and succeeding the letters don't actually alter the title's pronunciation. Parentheses have also been treated this way since the beginning of the project (though they do indicate multiple titles, but that's a different issue), Fall Out Boy's ""(Coffee's for Closers)"" isn't treated as technically not saying the title just because it's shrouded in parentheses. 

Arguing with hypothetical strawmen aside, ""Buy Myself"" eluded me for a bit as to whether I should consider it light orange, yellow, or yellow-green. I wound up deciding that ""buy myself"" is a loose rephrasing of ""by myself,"" hence deeming it yellow. Though, I'd like to hear others' thoughts on this one, since I'm still somewhat unsure.

**TL;DR**  
Linkin Park almost always has the title fully sung in the lyrics, or completely absent. They have one of the starkest red:green ratios I've seen in quite a bit, with very few other types of cases outside of *Reanimation*.

As a part of this ongoing project, I've decided that I'll share the spreadsheet that I do this on! [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnExSV4hxbPM3iv09wqgAdMDMywVIpWm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117518500519849329136&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnExSV4hxbPM3iv09wqgAdMDMywVIpWm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117518500519849329136&rtpof=true&sd=true)

I figure this is best given that I often make mistakes and am corrected, so it's easier for one to view that correction on the actual source image as opposed to me constantly uploading new screenshots. In addition, it provides a central place where you can view them all without having to scroll on my profile. I want this project to become a little more collaborative, so I encourage band suggestions as well as ways in which I can improve the spreadsheet over all.

Be sure to argue with me about how to pronounce "">,"" and to correct me on any mistakes that slipped through the cracks!",10,1735146410.0,LinkinPark,8,0.92,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In our fast-paced world, many people feel a strong urge to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with nature. This trend reflects an essential need to get back to nature. By spending time outdoors, you can significantly improve your well-being and quality of life. Here are some of the compelling benefits of immersing yourself in the natural environment.

### Enhances Mental Health

Nature has a profound impact on our mental clarity and emotional balance. Studies show that time spent outdoors can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. When you step outside, your body produces less cortisol, a hormone linked to stress. The simple act of breathing in fresh air can boost your mood and uplift your spirit.

Engaging with nature, whether by hiking, walking, or cycling, can also help you clear your mind. When you immerse yourself in the beauty around you, your worries seem to fade, allowing your mind to recharge. This can lead to increased creativity and better problem-solving skills.

### Boosts Physical Health

Returning to nature encourages you to be more active. Activities like hiking or jogging become easier and more enjoyable against a natural backdrop. Here are a few ways this experience can enhance your physical health:

- **Improved Cardiovascular Health:** Outdoor activities often require greater physical exertion, helping your heart and lungs work more effectively.
- **Better Balance and Coordination:** Navigating uneven terrain can enhance your balance, stability, and core strength.
- **Enhanced Immune Function:** Spending time outside increases your exposure to fresh air and sunlight, which can boost your vitamin D levels and immune system.

### Promotes Mindfulness and Awareness

Nature encourages mindfulness, allowing you to live in the moment. When you pay attention to the intricate details around you, like the sound of rustling leaves or the vibrant colors of flowers, you become more aware of your surroundings. This awareness can foster a sense of connection, which is often lost in our daily lives.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
Mindfulness practices, like meditation, can be enhanced by the natural setting. Engaging in yoga or meditation outdoors can deepen your focus and improve your overall well-being. Nature provides a serene backdrop that helps you reconnect with yourself.

### Improves Social Connections

Another significant advantage of spending time outdoors is its ability to strengthen social bonds. Whether you are hiking with friends or enjoying a picnic in the park, these shared experiences help foster community and relationships.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
Participating in group activities, like community clean-ups or nature walks, encourages teamwork and social interaction. These meaningful connections can enhance your overall happiness and provide you with a robust support network.

### Encourages Environmental Awareness

Getting back to nature helps you develop a deeper appreciation for the environment. When you engage with the world around you, you become more aware of your impact on it. This awareness can lead to more sustainable lifestyle choices. Here are some eco-friendly habits you might adopt:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
- **Reduce Waste:** By experiencing the beauty of nature, you become more inclined to minimize plastic use and reduce waste.
- **Support Local Conservation Efforts:** You might find yourself more inclined to participate in local cleanup events or conservation programs.
- **Practice Sustainable Living:** Awareness of our ecological footprint can inspire changes in your lifestyle, such as gardening, composting, or choosing eco-friendly products.

Ultimately, going back to nature can transform your life in various ways. Whether you're hiking a trail, relaxing at the beach, or picnicking in the park, these simple moments in nature can lead to lasting changes in your health, relationships, and perspective.

So, make it a priority to step outside, breathe in the fresh air, and embrace the beauty of the natural world. Your mind and body will thank you for it.

Practical Tips for Incorporating Nature into Your Everyday Life
---------------------------------------------------------------

Bringing nature into your daily routine can have a profound impact on your well-being. The benefits of connecting with nature are numerous, including reduced stress, increased creativity, and improved focus. Here are several practical tips to help you incorporate nature into your everyday life.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
### Start Your Day Outdoors

One simple way to embrace nature is to begin your morning outside. Open your windows to let in fresh air and sounds of chirping birds. If possible, enjoy your morning coffee or tea in your garden or on your balcony. This connection sets a positive tone for your day.

### Take Nature Walks

Make it a habit to take regular nature walks. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day, whether it's a stroll in the park, along a trail, or through scenic neighborhoods. Walking in nature not only boosts your mood but also enhances your physical health.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
### Bring Nature Home

Consider incorporating indoor plants into your living spaces. Plants such as pothos, snake plants, and peace lilies are low-maintenance and help purify your air. Here are a few tips on how to care for them:

- Place them in well-lit areas.
- Water as needed—don’t overwater!
- Dust the leaves occasionally to keep them healthy.

### Incorporate Natural Elements in Decor

Use natural materials to bring a sense of the outdoors into your home. Items like wooden furniture, stone accents, and nature-inspired artwork can create a calm atmosphere. You could also consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
1. Adding a nature-themed mural or wallpaper.
2. Using nature colors like greens, browns, and blues in your decor.
3. natural scents with essential oils or candles that give off woodsy aromas.

### Practice Mindful Outdoor Activities

Meditation or yoga outdoors can be deeply rejuvenating. Find a quiet spot in a nearby park or garden and spend time grounding yourself in nature. Even practicing breathing exercises under a tree can enhance your overall experience. Remember, nature doesn’t just have to be a backdrop; it can be an active part of your wellness routine.

### Create a Nature Journal

Documenting your experiences with nature can be an enriching practice. Keep a nature journal where you write down observations from your walks, sketches of plants and animals, or your reflections on how nature makes you feel. This can deepen your connection and appreciation for the natural world.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
### Explore Nature Together

Invite friends or family to join you for outdoor adventures. Plan activities like hiking, picnics, or gardening together. Shared experiences in nature can create strong bonds and turn simple outings into treasured memories. Additionally, adopting this practice encourages others to appreciate nature as well.

### Limit Screen Time

Consider cutting back on screen time, especially outdoors. When you're in a natural setting, try to put your phone away for a while. Immerse yourself in the sights and sounds around you. You might be surprised at how much more you notice without distractions.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature  
  
### Community Involvement

Get involved in local environmental initiatives or community gardens. Participating in these activities not only helps connect you with nature but also fosters a sense of belonging. You can help plant trees, clean up local parks, or even set up wildlife-friendly gardens in your neighborhood.

Integrating nature into your everyday life doesn’t have to be complex. Small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements in your mood and health. By adopting these tips, you can create a more harmonious balance that connects you to the natural world around you.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/back-to-nature

### Conclusion

Embracing a lifestyle that encourages you to go back to nature can transform your well-being and enrich your daily experiences. The benefits of reconnecting with the outdoors are numerous. From enhanced mental health to improved physical fitness, spending time in nature offers a calming escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It allows you to recharge, reflect, and rediscover simplicity in your world.

To make nature a regular part of your life, start small. Try to incorporate short walks in the park, garden in your backyard, or simply breathe deeply while sitting outside. These simple yet effective practices can refresh your mind and spirit. Consider establishing a weekly routine dedicated to nature, whether it’s hiking on weekends, visiting local gardens, or planning eco-friendly family outings. Even daily rituals like drinking your morning coffee outdoors or creating a nature-inspired reading nook at home can make a difference.

But now i am almost immune to the effects of caffeine.

To get rid of this immunity, i completely skipped coffee for a whole month. Not even a single cup. Even then the coffee is not doing anything for me now. I can fall asleep even after 2 shots of coffee. What do i do to get rid of this immunity. Please help. 

I have an underactive thyroid, so it's difficult for me to avoid sleep, caffeine was alot of help. But even that has stopped working for me. if there's an alternative to coffee, that would work too. Please help. 🥺",5,1735145695.0,IndiaCoffee,14,0.86,False

1hm47r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hm47r2/in_need_of_advice/,In need of advice,"Hi everyone,

I (F31) just ended a 9 year relationship with my boyfriend (M37) - an addict in recovery. He has been sober for 11 months, but his emotional immaturity really made it hard for me to keep coping. He gets angry for really small things since his sobriety (for example : being extremely angry when making a joke with a mutual friend that he always wants to leave very early when we need to go somewhere).

I believe it has to do with his low self esteem that is coming to the surface. He acknowledges this too, but still he feels that I don't understand him. The last time he was very upset when he made coffee for everyone on a trip with friends, and the last day of the trip a friend asked if we bought the coffee ourselves or if he got it from the cupboards in the appartment. He told her he found the coffee in the cupboards, which she replied to that they never take anything from the cupboards (appartment rented from a family friend). He took this very personal and was so upset and angry about it. It took an hour or longer for him to feel okay-ish again and act normal.

Afterwards my friend told me she and her BF felt like they had to walk on eggshells the whole time and she never knew this side of him. She found it 'admirable' how I could deal with this behaviour on a regular basis.

I tried to talk to him about it because I felt his reaction was unfair and disproportional towards our friends, but he felt as if I was worried more about our friends feelings than his feelings. He though I should just support him no matter what.

Eventually I gathered all my courage and asked him to start relationship therapy, but again he felt very attacked (""I worked so hard on myself this year, you want perfection,...""). Afterwards he calmed down and told me he was okay with starting therapy. But something in me already snapped. I just felt so tired and left our house the next day. Initially to find some peace for myself, but I just did not want to go back home to him. So after two weeks at my dad's house I broke up with him.

It's been a couple of weeks now and he really hopes that I change my mind and give our relationship another shot. He says he wants to grow old with me. He believes we can work on it together, but I feel like I can't fix his low self esteem issues and it is affecting my happiness and my mental wellbeing (I feel small in the relationship and I constantly adjust myself so I don't make it harder for him being in sobriety).

I don't know if I am making a big mistake by ending things now that he is sober and trying to work on himself. I am just devastated because there still is so much love between us. I am just so scared to feel stuck again.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

Whether you're looking for a financial boost or just a thrilling experience, knowing these **""Essential Sugar Baby Rules""** will help you swim through these waters like a pro. Here's your quick guide to making the most of your sugar baby journey.

**Setting Boundaries: Keep it Real**

You gotta know what you want and where to draw the line. Before jumping in, scribble down your limits. Got a story? There was this one time I didn't set clear boundaries and... let's just say, awkward moments were had. Trust me, when you’re both on the same wavelength, it's all smooth sailing.

**Safety First: Protect Yo' Self**

Meet in a public spot for the first date—think busy coffee shop vibes. Share your location with a friend (trust me, they’ll love the drama) and keep your personal info locked up tighter than Fort Knox. A Google Voice number is my BFF for staying safe while chatting up potential sugar daddies.

**Communication is Key: Spill the Tea**

Be upfront about what you’re looking for. Emotional support? Just companionship? Lay it all out there. I once had a sugar daddy where we both clicked because we knew exactly what we were signing up for. And hey, use those apps to keep it secure and private. Some of the best sugar daddy apps keep your digits secret, so no worries there.

**Money Talks: Let’s Chat Cha-Ching**

Discuss financials like a grown-up. Are we talking a monthly allowance or just covering some bills? Be clear and upfront. The time I didn’t was the time things got messy. Write it down if you have to—nothing wrong with a little paperwork to keep things tidy.

**Respect and Consent: No Means No, Buddy**

Consent isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the backbone of any relationship. Imagine you’re painting a masterpiece together—each stroke is a boundary. Violate it, and the whole thing falls apart. Always chat about what's cool and what's not, and check in often. It’s like a relationship tune-up.

**Keep It Private: Your Business is Your Business**

Don’t spill all your secrets at once. I never share my last name or address until I’m 110% sure about the person. Keeping things low-key makes it easier to enjoy without worries. When my friend did this, she found that it made her sugar dating life way more chill.

**Meeting Spots: Pick Wisely**

Cafes, parks, or your fave restaurant are great for first meetings. It’s public, it’s safe, and you can always make a quick exit if needed. Trust me, a fancy dinner date can be fun, but a cozy coffee shop gives you room to breathe.

**Communication Guidelines: When and How to Chat**

Agree on how often you’ll text or meet. Everyone’s got a life outside of this, right? Knowing when to expect a reply keeps things stress-free. I always talk this through upfront, especially if they're the busy type. It’s all about respecting each other’s time.

So, there you have it! Following these **""Essential Sugar Baby Rules""** will help you navigate the sugar dating scene without a hitch. Remember, it’s all about clear communication, respecting boundaries, and staying safe. Happy dating, y’all! 💸💖",1,1735145230.0,CyberCupid,0,1.0,False
1hm43zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1hm43zd/building_relationships_with_senior_leaders_as_a/,Building relationships with senior leaders as a management trainee,"Hi everybody,

Looking forward to your views on this one. 

I struggle with building relationships with senior colleagues - I notice I'm always shutting down nervously whenever I come across them. It's comparable to the feeling of the awkward silence at a first date! I feel like this is holding my career back, since I believe having that brief positive interaction at the coffee machine can do wonders for your career. Whenever work-content related in meetings or elsewhere, I never struggle. But purely from a social perspective, I feel boring as F$@\*. 

Has anyone gone through something like this in the beginning of their corporate career? If so, what did you do about it?. (I was in startups before, didn't experience this in smaller orgs)

I'm halfway through a management trainee programme in the R&D department of an MNC. My salary is paid by the senior VP's in the department, so it does feel like I should be having some kind of relationship with them. After the end of the programme, I should find a management job reporting to one of the directors (1 level below VP). My mentor in the programme is a director in the same department and we have a good relationship. However, senior leaders meet regularly to discuss performance and growth of the trainees, so I don't fully feel like I should discuss this with him. So far I've been getting very good feedback from my line managers on my work.",6,1735145228.0,managers,3,1.0,False
1hm43y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/1hm43y9/solo_out_of_law_school_update_7_months_in/,Solo out of law school update - 7 months in,"I have benefitted a lot from reading others' advice so thought I would share. Law is my second career. I went to law school knowing exactly what I wanted to do, which was heavily related to my first career.

I practice in a niche area of federal law. During law school, I clerked for two years in an organization doing the exact type of work that I now do in my firm, basically ghostwriting with supervision the exact same kind of cases I do now.

When I passed the bar, I initially got contract work for two attorneys who agreed to mentor me as I start my own practice. My practice does the same work but targets a slightly different clientele. We meet monthly for coffee, and I can call them anytime for advice and guidance. They have been extremely supportive.

While still doing contract work, I took two of my own private clients who came in by word of mouth. All my cases went really well. About three months in I launched my website.

**What my first 6 months looked like**

Initially, most of my cases were contract cases for my mentors, but that has now shifted and the majority of the cases are for my own firm. My cases take about 3-4 months from start to finish. As a result, my first three months produced little income. But the past four months have been very lucrative, making just under $80K on seven total completed cases, with three others pending and 3-4 more in the pipeline. I file 1-3 cases a month.

I ONLY take cases in the extreme niche area that I am competent in. I don't take anything at all outside this area. I also don't take dodgy cases.

**Startup costs**

I work from home and meet my clients on Zoom. In my practice area, everything is remote. My total startup costs were about $6,000. The biggest chunk of that was to attend a specialized training in my area of law. But I also paid for a MyCase subscription, Zoom, Docusign, Microsoft 365, malpractice insurance, a document scanner, Quickbooks subscription, and LLC startup costs. I use Google Voice for phone, which is free. I also made my own website on WIX, which saved a lot.

I thought I would hire a receptionist service, but found I don't really need to because I don't get a ton of unsolicited calls.

**How I get clients**

Most clients are word of mouth. My first clients came in from connections from my prior career. But I make a point of trying to have lunch with at least one new person a week, whether that's another attorney or an organization that could be a referral source. I told everyone I know what I'm doing. I had planned to blog, but I have been really swamped with work so I haven't had time. I have also done a few complete pro bono cases to generate goodwill with referral sources.

**What I have loved**

I have been pleasantly surprised by how successful I have been. My business plan was very cautious. I wanted to take 1-3 private cases, and my financial goal was to break even. I have far exceeded that. And there has never been a moment since I started when I wasn't busy. I am also happy that I have taught myself to do my cases from start to finish, including all the technical details on how to file, etc.

**What stresses me out**

Even though I have been really successful, my referral sources are eclectic. Each client comes in through a different source. Sometimes, the person who refers them to me is someone I have never heard of. As a result, I don't have total confidence that referrals are stable. I'd really like to hire a part-time virtual assistant to help with document management and filings. But I just don't feel quite comfortable making that kind of commitment yet.

All of this is to say that it is possible to start a solo practice out of law school, although I did it with some training wheels on and safeguards in place, while keeping to one area where I know I am competent.",42,1735145226.0,LawFirm,9,0.95,False

But when I brewed it, it tasted bitter, nothing like a medium roast and I could not even get the good taste that comes with specialty coffee. I brewed it with a V60 and the recipe was 4:6, 
Ratio: 1:15 temp: 100'C 
Bloom :40 gm +1min, 
90gm @ 1:45sec
135gm @ 2:30
185gm @ 3:15
225gm @ 4:30
Tried changing the grinder setting, water temp and bloom for next 3 brews. Nothing. 
Had heard lot of good things about the coffee from r/IndiaCoffee, and was wondering if people could share their recipes? 
I also have a French press, a moka pot and a aeropress. 
And do devans always deliver in different packaging than what is advertised??

Briefly about me: I work and listen to horror/ true crime/ fiction podcasts so as not to hear people, in my rare free time I read books, I used to love watching horror and mysticism, but I got tired of the same plots and switched to books. I'm going through a dark romance period (yes, I read smut) right now because I don't feel comfortable reading comedies and vanilla stories, they don't evoke emotion or interest. 

I am a Scorpio, 178cm too lazy for gym but love to workout, I love autumn, personal space, cats, coffee and sleeping with ASMR. I think I am a fairly calm person, my friends and colleagues consider me intelligent, patient and rational. Although I think I need to learn to control my aggression and not block every content or person that irritates me. 

I am looking for emotionally mature people who know what they want, who believe in romance and strong feelings. I need stability and the ability to relax. It's ironic that I don't believe in long distance relationships and online dating, but I still write here. I guess this is the first step to meeting someone good. 

We can start the conversation with a favorite song (I currently have on repeat ""Marry Christmas, Please Don't Call"" by Bleachers), good YouTube videos, movies or books recommendations (""Blindsight"" by Peter Watts)",1,1735144791.0,r4r,1,0.6,False

I drank until there was nothing left in the fridge. It all started yesterday when we went to our favorite burger joint...I'll just have one. But it never stops at just one...the thing is, I used to drink 6-8 beers every day but towards the middle of 2024 I scaled back to only drinking on the weekends. It just dosent make me feel good any more. In November I made a silent promise to myself that at the new year I would completely quit. So, back to this morning..I feel like a pile of dog crap. Woke up at 3am with horrible anxiety, headache, and nausea. When it was time for everyone to get up, we sat around chatting at the table sipping coffee. I had to pretend all was well and that I wasnt going to throw up right there. Opening presents..same thing. Then, my FIL gets on the phone with his mom. She lives a few states away. He puts her on speaker phone and the conversation was normal until I hear her say ""is [my name] an alcoholic? I was out yesterday and was approached by [person] and they said your sons wife (me) was an alcoholic"". I froze because how would they know that?? My husband pipes up and says ""it was probably that one time you face planted in front of Uncle, or that one time you face planted at camp, or that one time at [place]. Yall...I wanted to crawl in my nausea filled hole and be no more. And all of that was said right after I opened my gifts my in-laws gave me...which was an XL beer glass and a gift basket with 12 different international beers. I'm trying so hard to quit but it feels like every facet of my life revolves around drinking. I ended up skipping my company holiday party because it was at a tap house that was, literally, named after my favorite beer where they would have an open bar for several hours. I just want this part of my life to be in the past. I want to be done. So, IWNDWYT (I think that's the acronym lol). Stay safe everyone!!",33,1735144790.0,stopdrinking,9,1.0,False

[Prev Ep. 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hjdu1b/hunt_for_the_maji_the_blue_guitar_ep_10_witness/)

Old Canyon Road climbed the foothills until it offered a view far out over the Mission Valley. A carpet of clouds threatened precipitation.

Up ahead, three figures stood in the road: teenagers–a shirtless boy, skinny-nearly-skeletal, jacket hanging over his shoulder, and two girls. They did not move. He slowed to a stop, careful not to hit them. The boy had curly black hair tied in two ponytails on either side of his head. He smoked a long, thin cigarette. One of the girls held up a phone. She giggled and took a selfie with the valley as the backdrop. The boy let her finish her pictures, then slowly migrated to the side of the road.

Alan pulled up and rolled down his window. “Hey there.”

“Hi,” said the boy. “You here for the spin? Hundred bucks, easy.” He held up a delicate glass vial of blue liquid between his fingers. “L1. Strongest ever. Don’t even need L2 with this shit.”

Alan swallowed hard. “You’ll always need L2,” he said.

“Yeah?” said the boy. “Hundred and we can make it happy.”

“I’m looking for someone,” Alan said.

“I know people. I know everyone!” He turned to the valley, threw his hands up, and shouted something in Salish. “I know everyone!” The kid was riding the ecstasy of the spin.

“White Owl. I need to talk to her.”

The boy smiled down at him. “Who?”

“She goes by White Owl.”

The kid shouted to the girls in Salish. They stopped dancing and shouted back, and he laughed.

“What’d she say?” Alan asked.

“She said just keep on your current journey if you want to get into trouble. Owls fly on silent wings, and white owls are suspicious. Anything white is suspicious. You should take a picture before the snow comes. White owls are invisible in the snow.” He trotted down the hill after the girls. The shorter of the two did a pirouette and fell into his arms, and he kissed her.

Alan got out and stretched his legs, watching them shrink away until they were three indistinct figures. The side of the road was marked by a guardrail, beyond which the earth banked and tumbled down into a patchwork of fields and farmhouses and the great Highway 93.

He held up his phone, turned, took the photo, and stared out at the far distant hills. “You don’t have a job anymore, you stupid son of a bitch.” He looked at his contacts. His thumb hovered over a name and then touched it. It rang a long time before someone answered.

“Hello? Hello?” said a woman’s soft voice.

“Hey, Ashley?”

“Alan?”

“A couple years, I guess.”

“Try fourteen.”

“Sorry.”

“Fourteen fucking years.”

“I’m sorry, Ash. There’s no excuse.”

An extended moment passed where he could hear his sister’s breath. It was familiar to him.

“It’s my fault, too…” she said. “After…” Her voice fell off with an unspoken reference. “I told you I’ll never go back to the Rez.”

“This isn’t on you, Ash. I said I’d visit.”

“Time is a river, right? You okay, big brother?”

“I just wanted to say hi and hear your voice.”

“Hi,” she said. “Dad would have liked you staying there. He loved the valley.”

“He did,” he said.

“I was thinking of trying to call you. Like, for the last few weeks.”

“How’s Bran?”

“Good. Big now. Grown up.”

“I’m going to come and see you… soon,” he said.

“No, you’re not. But I love you,” she said.

“I love you too.”

“I bought a restaurant,” she said.

“No shit? What do you cook?”

“A little bit of everything.”

“Dad would have liked that,” he said.

“Are you okay?” she asked again.

“I’m okay,” he told her again.

“We’re a couple of nut cases, aren’t we? Love ya, big brother.” She was crying.

“Love ya,” he said.

She ended the call.

The kids had vanished down the dirt road altogether. Were they ever really there? His face felt numb. His eyes stung from the cold wind.

***

DEAD END

It was snowing. Past each sign the road grew steeper.

NO TRESPASSING

The trees grew taller, their trunks like massive arrows shot through the earth, turning daylight into gray shadow.

NO RETURN

He parked in front of the fallen bridge and a green-primer car set on its rims with a smashed windshield and a sapling growing through its rear bumper. He got out and smoked a cigarette while inspecting the steep bank. The canal was deep and empty and lined with sharp rocks dusted with snow. Night was coming in.

He stepped on his cigarette and carefully navigated down the embankment, his shoes slipping on the rocks and the thin gauze of snow. At the bottom of the canal bed, he gazed up the slope of the other side. Old-growth evergreens towered over him; their tops reached up and were lost in the flurry.

He grasped a diving root and pulled himself up the other side until he could reach a branch crusted with ice. The cold numbed his fingers, making them clumsy. Three hours earlier, in Murphy’s office, he could not have imagined that he’d be on the side of a mountain surrounded by wilderness, tragically dressed the way bodies that have gone missing are found: slacks, dress shirt, a light windbreaker, and shoes with treadless soles.

A clump of soil under his left foot gave out, and he went down hard, the metal cowbell in his pocket punching him quickly in the gut when he hit the rocky slope.

“Ow! Fuck!”

Wind blasted down through the canyon of trees, peppering sleet into his face. If he didn’t know better, he’d think the mountain did not want him to continue.

The forest felt hostile and alien. He was a Montana boy, born and raised, but he’d never been one for the outdoors. He preferred to spend his time stuffed in a book, hanging out at the mall, or lounging in the coffee shops. He laughed at himself. Ash had loved nature. Funny that it was she who’d immigrated to the city.

_What was that?_

Near the corner of his vision, he thought he saw movement to his left. He stood still, taking short, shallow breaths so he could hear. Only the wind through the branches. Had he seen anything at all? He was unsure now.

Bears and wolves inhabited the Mission Mountains as protected species. Last summer, farther south on the range, a Japanese tourist had been killed by a grizzly and devoured over the span of several days by nature’s scavengers.

Or was it the Native Americans? He was, after all, trespassing on _their_ land.

He trudged forward.

After they lost the old farm, they moved into a trailer park where his friends and enemies were all Natives. He used to pray his pasty white skin would darken. Even if he could get a tan, it might have stopped him from getting his ass kicked after school. Alas, his people were seemingly allergic to the sun.

Then there was Zoey, who was Kootenai. How he’d memorized her color—summer’s honey and smoky dusk.

“Hello!” he shouted, but his hale was swallowed by the wind and foliage. He tried to scan through the primeval wood and impenetrable undergrowth.

“Hello!”

The signal indicator on his phone bore a red line through it. The trees and the mountain were too dense. Maybe he was lost. Perhaps Little Joe had no idea where White Owl lived. Possibly, there was no such person as White Owl. It might be better to return and help Mickey devise a defense for Francis. If he went back now, he would still have daylight.

The tracks he made had already been erased by the snow. He attempted to use his GPS, but his wet screen wouldn’t recognize his fingertip.

Something on the side of the mountain caught his eye. He focused on it for a second, and it was like a secret image emerging from a 3D picture: a handrail made from dead branches had been nailed and tied to the trunks of the great pines.

He grabbed the rail and found crude steps hewn out of the rocks. As he climbed, he looked up and saw the webbing of a gigantic dream catcher in the trees above him, larger than the span of his arms. A loop of branches, about six feet across, supported a web of white, spindly hair that fluttered with large, white feathers. At the center of the dream catcher was the skeleton of a dead bird, the bones of its wings outstretched and bound with the hair like the prey of a gigantic spider.

Slowly, carefully, he ascended. Progress was arduous in the new fallen snow. In the dead of winter, it would be impossible. If this was the way to White Owl’s house, Francis would have to undertake this journey to get to school—every morning down, every evening up.

When he reached the dream catcher, he could barely maintain his grip. The skull stared at him with empty eyes and open beak, shouting a warning he could not possibly hear as he transgressed its frontier.

The stairs leveled out onto a ledge no wider than a yard, and a massive wooden door built into the cliff face stood before him.

He knocked.

Nothing.

He turned on the ledge and looked down the way he had come. Down there in the snow, blending into the shadow, a face stared up at him, wild and savage. He wiped the water from his eyes and looked again. No, not a face, just a mesh of branches.

He knocked again as hard as he could. He spun back around and scrutinized his retreat. _There_. Something had certainly moved, had leapt across the forest floor.

He took the cowbell from his pocket and rang it vigorously. _Dong, dong, dong, dong_ echoed up the rock wall of the little alcove.

Flush with the rock, the door had its hinges bolted into the cliff with large, rusted lags.

Then, from the other side, came a muffled pounding, and the slab of wood cracked open an inch.

“Pull hard!” a voice shouted through the barricade.

He wedged his fingers into the gap between the door and the rock and pulled with all his strength. He could feel the negative pressure of the wind being sucked into the mountain. Slowly, the door came open, and someone shoved a plank of wood through to stop it from being pulled closed again.

“Fast,” said the voice.

He slipped inside with a gush of wind, and the door slammed shut behind him, plunging him into complete darkness.",1,1735144655.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

A few weeks ago I started up a website where we can share Aiden brew profiles. It’s a work in progress still, but it allows you to post the share link to your profile in an centralised online database that anyone can search through when trying to find their style of coffee.

https://brewshare.coffee

To submit a link, open your profile and then hit the share button in the Aiden app and choose the option to copy the link to your clipboard. You will then have a link to https://brew.link in your clipboard which you can paste in to the site. 

You can choose to submit a profile anonymously if you like, but if you create an account (click the hamburger icon if you’re on mobile) you can come back to edit the profile later. You can also add your email to the profile (without signing up) and register at a later date and the profile should be available to you to edit. 

I have plans to add things like a 1-5 scale for things like body, sweetness, etc, and likely a voting system, but those will come in the new year.

I’m not going to spam this too much (I’ve already posted here once before about it) but I figured lots people are likely going to be unboxing their Aidens today and might be a good opportunity to get people sharing their profiles!

1hm3lmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1hm3lmy/struggling_with_communication_with_partner/,Struggling with communication with partner,"Hi,  
I could really use some external advice about navigating an LDR, I've been ruminating for a while and i have no idea anymore whether my feelings are valid or not. (Sorry for the long post, i needed to vent a little)

**Background**: I (24F) met my boyfriend (29M) in May while traveling in Colombia. Went back home to Canada few days later. It started as a casual fling, and we texted sporadically until the end of July when we began texting and calling more regularly. By the end of August, things got more serious, and after a disagreement about communication, he told me he loved me—which is how we kind of became ""official.""

The thing is, our communication feels sparse and one-sided. He only texts me when it’s convenient for him—never before 10 a.m., even though he’s been awake for hours prior. He rarely shares details about his life, despite me repeatedly telling him I’d be thrilled to hear even the smallest, most mundane things.

It feels like he always communicates on his terms—when and how it works for him—which leaves me feeling like an afterthought ; like he can only talk to me when there's absolutely nothing else left to do, not even while taking the bus or having coffee. Right now, we’re in different time zones (6 hours apart), and his messages have dwindled even more. I’ve asked him to text me even when I’m not online so I can feel like he’s thinking of me, but he rarely does.

The thing that bothers me most is that the messages he sends lack substance most of the time. I feel like we rarely have a true conversation. I often feel like i\`m being talked /at/ instead of talked to. He sends the same messages everyday - good morning, i\`m tired today, going inside (he is not allowed his phone at work), then a few texts at lunch reacting to my daily blabbing to him, and then letting me know he got off work and getting food. We get a 1 hour window to talk from 8-9pm, where he usually does his night routine, so no long convo during that time either. And i push i him to talk about stuff but it's often not conclusive... And ive told him multiple times he could tell me about a speck of dust on his shoe and i would care; but he never changes his way of communicating.

I feel like I’m trapped in this honey cage. He is such a sweet and caring person, and I can tell he genuinely try to make me feel cherished. His I love yous and compliments (""You’re so perfect,"" ""I can’t believe you’re mine"" etc.) are incredibly sweet and make me feel amazing, but... in the end I also feel so lonely. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not truly *seen*—like I’m more of a fantasy he projects onto than a person he’s genuinely interacting with. And its incredibly lonely and alienating. Like I'm better seen afar.

I can't shake the feeling that maybe I am overthinking this. And thatI feel like im so ""demanding"" and anxious about the messages because i rarely get any of true substance so im never satiated...if that makes sense?

I’ve never been in an LDR before, so I don’t know what’s normal or healthy in this kind of dynamic. I’m starting to feel crazy. If anyone could share advice or similar situations perhaps? I feel I may just need some perspective on this.

  
TLDR ; Met my boyfriend in May while traveling, and we started a long-distance relationship (Canada/Colombia). He’s sweet, caring, and says all the right things (""I love you,"" ""You’re perfect,"" etc.), but his communication feels sparse, one-sided, and on his terms. I’ve told him I’d love to hear even mundane details about his day, but his messages are often repetitive, lack substance, or skip over what I say. It makes me feel lonely and unseen, like I’m more of a distant fantasy than a real person he connects with.",6,1735143586.0,LongDistance,1,0.88,False

My wife wakes up and sees me sitting down drinking coffee and *glares*. No Merry Christmas, nothing. 

After some coaxing, she suddenly erupts and yells that we need to start cooking Christmas lunch.

Apparently she'd agreed with her family that we'd do Christmas lunch at ours. But they hadn't confirmed numbers or a time. They decided that I'd be making lunch.

But they forgot to tell me. 

With an hour and a half's notice before lunch, I've been rushing around like a madman. The brussel sprouts are now ready for the air fryer, the turkey breasts are in the oven, and the sweet potato mash is sorted. 

The only saving grace is that our LO is still breastfed, so her first Christmas lunch won't be a total mess.",3,1735143558.0,daddit,3,1.0,False

For the past three years I have been dealing with “a weird head feeling”. Anytime someone asks me to describe it, I literally can’t. My head just feels weird. Like I’m dizzy inside my head but not actually dizzy, or off balance, or anything. It feels like spacey and weird and floaty but all just inside my head. It constantly feels like something is about to happen, like a seizure or stroke or aneurism or something super sinister. If I’m just laying there doing nothing and I’m dealing with the sensation, it helps for me to shake my leg (like bounce it lol) in order for me to not feel it so intensely (yes I know I sound crazy). Idk if it’s hormonal related, or anxiety related, or what it is. I have gotten 2 CT scans which have come back normal but I am getting an MRI sometime soon. It definitely sometimes get worse at night when I’m laying down and I feel like I have to hold my head in order to fall asleep because it can be overwhelming. Idk if maybe it’s caffeine related or something because I do drink a lot of coffee. I also feel like the more I focus on it the more intense it gets. Mostly I just feel really fucking weird in the head. It also comes with sometimes not feeling real or feeling like I’m almost in a dream like state and sort of drunk or high a little bit but I’ve truly just never have been able to explain it perfectly and it drives me crazy. Anyone else deal with this? Sometimes makes my eyes feel weird too I guess. Idk. Help lol.  ",3,1735143538.0,Anxiety,9,1.0,False

I've always been one who needs a high level of stimulation (sports, fast music, coffee, power tools). When I don't have this I generally zone out. For instance, I can read a page of a book but then realize I was thinking about something else the whole time. For those who believe in ADHD, this is it.

Anyway, wondering if anyone else with a similar personality found a way to be content and tuned in.

It tasted way better than any energy drink I’ve ever had, has no carbonation (I just personally don’t like carbonation), it is legitimately zero sugar and artificial sweetener free, and for the price point it is FAR cheaper than drinking canned drinks. It’s my only source of caffeine now and I feel a lot better in general and have even lost some weight. 

I get the appeal of “gamer girls thighs and waifu cups” even if it isn’t for me personally, but I do sort of wish the marketing wasn’t so much of that because if it wasn’t I could see GG in Walmarts and other retail stores. Maybe I’m a moron though haha. ",31,1735143337.0,gamersupps,8,0.92,False
