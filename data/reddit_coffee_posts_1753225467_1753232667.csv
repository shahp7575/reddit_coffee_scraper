1m6vo22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypnosis/comments/1m6vo22/question_about_the_pcm_in_the_integrative/,Question about the PCM in the Integrative Response Set Theory,"I had a question about how the predictive coding model (PCM) relates to the integrative response set theory of hypnosis from Steven Lynn, specifically this paper: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029157.2022.2117680](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029157.2022.2117680)

  
I'm a well-read home gamer, not a psychology student, and I'm reading well above my pay grade. I'm more looking for gaps in my understanding than to pin down a theory on a technicality. With that in mind, here's my summarized interpretation of the relevant bits of the paper:

\- The integrative response set model asserts that expectations and predictions are a major component of hypnotic response. (100% agree and understood!)

\- However, they mention the PCM where top down predictions affect both actions (grabbing a cup of coffee entails predicting yourself as grabbing that cup of coffee) and perceptions (where predictions can strongly influence perceptions),

\- The integrative response set model also asserts (I believe as part of the PCM) predictions and expediencies are one of the same. From the section on the PCM (aptly titled, The predictive coding model)

\> Can expectancies be construed as predictions? The answer to this question is ""yes:"" Prediction and expectancy are synonymous. An expectancy is by definition a prediction.

  
Outside of the paper, it looks like the PCM theorizes predictions happen at the neurological level (which may be a misunderstanding on my part.) My question about the integrative response set theory, as well as the PCM, is if cognitive expectations ""I expect my arm to lift"" occur at the neuronal level, and thus fit neatly into predictive processing, or, if our cognitive expectations are a superset of this, where my cognitive expectation for the arm to lift would start to propagate to neuronal expectations, ""lower"" than the cognitive expectations.

I realize this is nuanced and my question may be ill-formed, and the answer is unlikely to be binary.

\[pay wall, German language, machine translation\]

The sex trade has been legal in Germany for over 20 years. The law was supposed to protect prostitutes. But it turned out to be a disastrous mistake, as the brutal reality on the streets and in brothels shows.

Lena had no idea that the man with the charming smile was a pimp. Viktor was tall, well-built, and tattooed. A charming guy, he was also a world-champion martial artist. He introduced himself as the bar owner and treated Lena and her friend to a fruit plate. The next day, he posted a flame emoji under a photo of her on Instagram. Lena and Viktor exchanged messages and got along well. A few days later, they had consensual sex.

Today she knows: The man has two faces.

After their third meeting, Viktor kidnapped Lena to a brothel. He forced the then 20-year-old to work as a prostitute. The men came in droves. Lena was raped.

SPIEGEL has changed the names of those involved to protect the student's identity. This also applies to all the other prostitutes in this report. Viktor was sentenced to six years and three months in prison for rape, particularly aggravated forced prostitution, and pimping. The verdict recently became final.

What Lena experienced represents much of what goes wrong in the milieu, with one notable exception: pimps or human traffickers are rarely convicted. **In no other profession is the power imbalance as stark as in prostitution: one person pays, the other offers their body**. Women, but also men and transgender individuals, are exploited, raped, and psychologically broken. Some are lured to Germany with false promises, manipulated by men, or—as in Lena’s case—threatened and abducted. Yet in the #MeToo debate, they hardly have a place, and victims of forced prostitution have no advocacy.

Since 2002, prostitution in Germany has no longer been considered “immoral” but rather a completely normal profession, as established by the newly enacted Prostitution Act. According to this, prostitutes are self-determined entrepreneurs who voluntarily offer sex for sale, much like a fruit seller offering apples and pears. Prostitutes were granted access to social security, pension schemes, and health insurance, and they have been able to sue for their wages ever since. The law, along with the Prostitutes’ Protection Act introduced in 2017, was intended to strengthen their rights.

So much for the theory. In practice, the balance sheet after more than two decades looks grim. According to estimates, around 250,000 prostitutes work in Germany. However, **only 23,700 are officially registered, few are health insured, and hardly any are socially insured**. The law was well-intentioned; it was supposed to protect women. But it was a disastrous mistake, as the brutal reality on the streets and in brothels shows.

**Experts believe that 60 to 90 percent of the women prostitute themselves unwillingly—out of poverty or because they are forced to.** ""The liberal legislation encourages demand and, therefore, also human trafficking in Germany,"" says Peter Holzwarth, a senior public prosecutor from Stuttgart. ""We have a reputation like Thailand,"" says former chief criminal inspector Helmut Sporer, who investigated in the red-light district for roughly 30 years. Germany is considered the ""brothel of Europe.""

Lena, a young woman who has received help as a former victim of forced prostitution, is slim and has a gentle gaze. She chooses her words carefully. ""**I can hardly imagine that any woman does this job voluntarily,**"" Lena says. ""**I cannot understand why prostitution is legal in Germany**.""

Lena only vaguely remembers the day Viktor showed her the brothel for the first time. On the evening of their third meeting, Lena recalls Viktor disappearing into the bathroom with two champagne glasses, allegedly to rinse them. After drinking, she felt strange. ""I couldn't control my body anymore,"" Lena says. The court is convinced that Viktor spiked her drink with ecstasy.

Viktor drove Lena approximately 70 kilometers away to a brothel where he already had two women working for him. He told her that if she wanted to keep seeing him, she had to work for him as a prostitute. Lena remembers standing in the dim light among the half-naked women, feeling ""like in the wrong movie."" She also vividly remembers a young woman kneeling in front of Viktor while he counted money. ""I was paralyzed,"" Lena says. ""That evening, I decided to break off contact.""

The next day, Viktor drove his BMW to the house where she lived with her parents. He threatened to slit her father’s throat if she didn’t go with him, Lena says. She was in shock. ""My very first thought was: How can I protect my dad?"" Outside, Viktor, the martial artist with a broad chest and a full beard, waited; inside, Lena hurriedly packed her things. She told her father she was going to visit a friend in Berlin for a few days.

A bed, a bathroom, a sink, red light — that’s how Lena remembers the room where she had to serve men, but also where she slept and ate. A prostitute brought her lubricant, towels, and condoms and explained the prices to Lena: oral sex and intercourse with a condom €50. Oral sex without a condom €30 extra. Licking, fingering, kissing €20 extra each.

""I was paralyzed inside, completely empty,"" Lena says. ""I didn’t know what to do. I was scared."" The court is convinced that Lena was still under the influence of drugs. Lena cried. Viktor embraced her. Then he raped her. This is stated in the court's ruling.

That same evening, the first client came into the room, Lena recounts. A man in his mid-40s wearing a DHL uniform. She felt numb and endured the intercourse. ""At that moment, I was a different person.""

""**You are afraid of every man who comes into your room; you never know what’s going to happen**. When I entered the brothel, I was only Alicia, the prostitute. During sex with the men, I listened to music to distance myself mentally. **Some men think you’re a slave; they think they can do anything with you because they’ve paid**. I often fought back when clients became violent. There was zero respect.""  
– Alicia, former prostitute from Romania

The dignity of a person is inviolable, as stated in Article 1 of the German Basic Law. ""The dignity of a person is violated in prostitution,"" says Ulrich Rommelfanger, lawyer and former state constitutional judge from Wiesbaden. Together with social ethicist Elke Mack, he explores the question of whether prostitution laws comply with the Basic Law in the book *“Sexkauf”* (Sex Purchase), set to be published on Monday.

The legislator has given ""too little attention to the concept of human dignity,"" says Rommelfanger. A person must never be misused as a mere ""means to an end."" ""That would violate their dignity."" The business of prostitution involves the client buying the right to use the woman’s body for his satisfaction. ""It violates the Basic Law if the state permits a client to use the woman unilaterally for his own purposes against her will.""

The laws that were supposed to guarantee the protection and rights of prostitutes are based on the assumption that all women engage in prostitution voluntarily, says Elke Mack, a professor at the University of Erfurt. And that assumption is flawed. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers have failed to question this premise. ""Prostitutes give up their right to sexual self-determination in order to unilaterally fulfill the desires of the client,"" says Mack. ""A prostitute could only be considered self-determined if she could at any time say: Stop, this is painful, please be considerate.""

Mack doubts that such freedom exists. Women are almost always in situations of financial dependence and distress. They have to support their families back home financially or are under the control of a pimp. ""When sexuality does not occur with mutual respect, it becomes an instrument of humiliation,"" she says. ""Then it is sexual violence.""

When the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs examined the safety and health of prostitutes for a study published in 2005, it was revealed that 41 percent of respondents had experienced physical or sexual violence, or both, in their work environment. Often, clients and pimps were named as the perpetrators. About a quarter of the prostitutes surveyed reported frequent or occasional suicidal thoughts. Nearly one-fifth of all women said they had suffered serious injuries such as broken bones, facial injuries, burns, or dislocated joints.

**Almost no client has ever been punished for exploiting a prostitute's distress — even though it's a criminal offense in Germany**. The risk of being prosecuted is ""almost zero."" This was the conclusion of a 2021 report by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony. The regulations addressing human trafficking in Germany were described as ""hardly practical."" The paragraph regulating the punishment of clients was subsequently tightened. Now, anyone who ""recklessly"" disregards the coercive situation of a prostitute can be punished with up to three years in prison — though it remains unclear how such recklessness can be proven.

The Federal Ministry of Justice informed SPIEGEL upon inquiry that it has no data yet on whether the new regulation has proven effective. According to the ""Bundeslagebild Menschenhandel"" report by the Federal Criminal Police Office, there were only 291 completed investigations for sexual exploitation in 2021; more than half involved forced prostitution. In 39 cases, the sexual exploitation involved underage victims of forced prostitution. Authorities believe there is a large number of unreported cases.

The pressure that prostitutes are under is enormous. At the same time, investigators are powerless if the women do not open up. ""A conviction only happens if the women testify,"" says Senior Prosecutor Holzwarth. He managed one of the most sensational cases in the red-light district in Stuttgart in recent years, filling 170 Leitz binders with case files.

At the center of the investigation was Jürgen Rudloff, a businessman who advertised his FKK club Paradise near Stuttgart in the media as a ""wellness oasis for men."" A boxy building, about 5000 square meters in size. Everything was clean, Rudloff repeatedly emphasized. In reality, the biker gangs Hells Angels and United Tribuns were in control, and they were not to be trifled with. There were too few women willing to work voluntarily at Paradise. As a result, pimps brought in women whom they forced into prostitution, sometimes brutally beating them. One woman was reportedly beaten so severely that her blood splattered up to the ceiling.

Rudloff was sentenced in 2019 to several years in prison for aiding and abetting pimping and severe human trafficking, as he had knowingly tolerated forced prostitution.

""You have to put in an enormous effort to catch human traffickers,"" says investigator Peter Holzwarth. Since the EU's eastern expansion in 2004, poverty-driven prostitution by women from Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary has significantly increased. ""We don't have enough personnel to unravel all cases as thoroughly as the Paradise trial,"" Holzwarth adds. He estimates that three out of four women do not engage in prostitution voluntarily. **Suppressing the market is essential, says Holzwarth. ""We need a ban on the purchase of sex.""**

Understanding the state of coercion is vital, says Alexandra. Her story mirrors that of many women from Eastern Europe. She grew up in poverty in Bulgaria. Her mother lost her job and migrated to Cyprus. ""She didn't know how else to feed us,"" says Alexandra. At the time, she was only 14 years old and had to take care of her two younger siblings. ""My childhood was over,"" Alexandra says.

Her mother barely sent money from Cyprus. ""We were hungry,"" says Alexandra. This is how she fell into the hands of a pimp and sometimes had to serve three to four men a day sexually. The money was just enough to pay for electricity, water, and food. ""I was ashamed,"" she says.

At the age of 18, she fell in love with a Bulgarian man. ""He promised me a beautiful life; we wanted to start a family."" The so-called Loverboy Method is a popular tactic that pimps use to force women into prostitution. Loverboys play with young women's dreams, pretend to be deeply in love, and push them to work on the streets or in brothels.

For the dream of a better life, Alexandra worked as a prostitute on Helenenstraße in Bremen. On weekdays, she served ten clients a day, up to 25 on weekends. The money went to her boyfriend. ""I lived in a bubble; I had no friends,"" she says.

When she became pregnant, she decided to leave the life behind. ""I was mentally at my breaking point and wanted a different life for my daughter,"" Alexandra says. Her boyfriend did not accept her decision. He came at her with a knife. She shows scars on her legs and face.

“The women who work on the streets have hardly any alternatives,” says streetworker Jana Schmid as she walks along Berlin's Kurfürstenstraße. In her green shoulder bag, she carries chocolate bars, condoms, and shower gel; in her right hand, she holds a coffee pot. Once a week, Schmid visits the prostitutes along with a Hungarian interpreter to check how they are doing.

The young women walk lazily up and down the street in bright outfits while mothers push their strollers past them. On one side, there are luxury apartments; on the other side, a sex shop and a church. High metal fences block off residential entrances. Residents have been calling for years, to no avail, for street prostitution to be banned.

Schmid stops in front of a woman with pink hair. “Can I offer you a coffee?” Schmid asks. The woman shakes her head but would take a condom. She asks Schmid if she knows a gynecologist; she has severe period pain but no health insurance. Schmid writes down the number of a doctor on a piece of paper.

On the opposite side of the street, a tattooed man in shorts exchanges a few words with a young woman in a green skirt. They get into a black car and drive away.

Not far from the labor court, a woman in a snake-print dress sits next to a small wooden toilet shed. The city has set up these so-called “sex boxes” for prostitutes to simultaneously work and conduct their business. It smells like feces and urine. The woman says she just performed oral sex on a client for €20; drug addicts would do it for €5. She explains that she’s saving for a house for herself and her six-year-old son.

“**One day, a time will come when we will be ashamed in Germany of what we’ve done to these young women from Eastern Europe,**” says SPD Member of Parliament Leni Breymaier. She has been advocating for a ban on the purchase of sex in Germany for years. “To me, **this is the slave trade of our time.**” The Prostitution Act was well-intentioned, she says, “but not a single goal was achieved.”

**The rights of the few voluntary sex workers do not justify the suffering of the many who are forced into it**. “I also have a hard time imagining that there’s a woman sitting somewhere in Africa or Romania thinking: Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to work in a brothel,” Breymaier adds. **Everyone agrees that sexual harassment is taboo in the workplace, but the moment someone puts €20 on the table, he can do whatever he wants with a woman**, she says. “We dehumanize women and reduce them to objects. **As long as you can buy a woman, every woman has a price.**”

Julia Wege, a professor at Ravensburg-Weingarten University of Applied Sciences, has been researching the situation of prostitutes in Germany for 14 years. “**Only a fraction of women in prostitution work self-determinedly**,” says Wege. “All we see is the woman in the shop window, and we think: She rented a room, pays taxes, everything’s clean.” In reality, the women are “**often trapped in a cycle of violence and have no contacts outside the red-light milieu. They are severely traumatized and need years to break free.**”

In her doctoral thesis, Wege studied the biographies of prostitutes. Some women work voluntarily and earn well. They can defend themselves against boundary violations, appear on talk shows, organize in industry associations, and advocate for better working conditions. “I’ve met dominatrixes or women in escort services who say: If I experience violence, I go to the police—I don’t stand for it.”

The others work in prostitution not voluntarily but are forced into it due to circumstances of coercion or desperation. “Many women are ashamed of their job and tell their families nothing about it,” says Wege. **Often, these women experienced violence or sexual assault in childhood and never developed self-confidence. “For many, prostitution is a survival strategy because they are psychologically weakened and have no other options to shape their lives.**” These laws do not protect them.

Anna belongs to this second group of women. She needs a smoke outside before starting the interview. The 44-year-old places her coffee with milk and Red Bull on the terrace of a counseling center for prostitutes, which she visits regularly. She is one of the women who has never been registered as a sex worker, has no health insurance—and doesn’t appear in any official statistics.

She came to Germany in 2010 from Bulgaria to provide a better life for her three children, Anna says. “We didn’t have money for rent, electricity, or food.” She left her three children with their grandmother, and her youngest daughter was just one and a half years old at the time. Today, her daughters live in a group home, and her son resides with a foster family. This is confirmed by documents provided to SPIEGEL.

In Germany, she initially worked as a waitress, Anna says. But her earnings were so meager that there was barely anything left. “I couldn’t send money home,” Anna says. “I cried every day for my children.” So she turned to street prostitution. To this day, her children know nothing about it.

She offers “screwing, oral sex without a condom” for €50. Competition is fierce. Business isn’t going well. “I miss my children,” Anna says. She hasn’t even been able to visit Bulgaria at Christmas. Recently, she tried to get a cleaning job, she says. But without good language skills, a fixed address, and health insurance, she has no chance.

“**For me, prostitution is rape in exchange for money.** The women suffer from extreme pain and psychological strain. Many do not have health insurance. The clients demand sex without condoms. The women contract HIV, suffer from chronic pelvic inflammation, and even become infertile. In our country, it is not legally prohibited for pregnant women to work as prostitutes until the 34th week of pregnancy. This has nothing to do with human dignity.”

– Wolfgang Heide, gynecologist in Heidelberg

For Lena, the weeks in the brothel were hell. In the beginning, Viktor came every day, collected her money, and raped her. Viktor wanted to know when she got up, served clients, and went to bed. He controlled her food intake and forced her to lose weight. When she developed a urinary tract infection, she had to return to work after just one rest day. Viktor made it difficult for her to stay in touch with friends. He instructed Lena to send a farewell message to her parents, saying she wanted to go her own way. Lena’s mother used to write to her almost daily. Out of fear that Viktor might harm her parents, Lena fended her off.

Lena had to wear bras, panties, and garters that Viktor chose for her. On weekdays, she served 20 clients, and on weekends up to 40 a day. “I couldn’t choose the men; I had to take every one of them,” says Lena. Among them were aggressive young men and older men over the age of 60, whom she found repulsive. “**To the clients, you’re just an object. They want to have fun, release pressure, humiliate a woman**,” Lena says. Some even asked her to urinate on them.

One particular client made her especially angry, she says. He must have suspected that she wasn’t working in the brothel willingly—but he still didn’t help her in the end. “There were men who wanted to know if I was really doing this voluntarily, saying I was so sweet,” Lena says. “I was angry and thought: If you suspect that, then please call the police.” Viktor often stood in the hallway and monitored her. “I couldn’t speak openly,” Lena says.

She had become emaciated, rarely left the brothel, and Viktor accompanied her to doctor’s appointments. After a few weeks, Lena changed her strategy. ""I saw no other way out than to gain his trust."" She pretended to Viktor that she was now willingly working for him. ""When he raped me, I stopped pushing him away and stopped resisting,"" Lena says.

The plan worked—he started controlling her less, Lena says. ""That gave me the courage to send my location to my friends over my phone."" She told them the truth. ""They immediately wanted to get me out, but I said: That’s way too dangerous,"" Lena says.

A few days later, Lena made an appointment to get her eyelashes done. ""It was always important to Viktor that I looked good,"" Lena says. He was unable to accompany her that day. Lena informed her friends and got on a train to go home. That same day, she went to the police.

For months afterward, she barely left the house and drank bottles of wine. Her friends and family helped her through the difficult time. But the forced prostitution altered her, Lena says. She no longer has any desire for sex and cannot trust any man. ""The experiences destroyed my perception of men."" Lena says, ""When I see someone with a sweet smile today, I can no longer smile back.""

Yesterday, my partner completely lost his temper, shouting at me, calling me lazy and stupid, and telling me I have to do whatever he says.
He said he’d leave me if I weren’t pregnant, because I’m “always tired” and “never do anything,” even though I cook every day, keep the house clean, and do all the shopping.
He told me he would smash my phone if he saw me using it again, saying I should be doing something “productive.”
When I tried to explain how I felt, he told me that other pregnant women go out for coffee and live normally — unlike me. But I’m in my first trimester. I’m not ready to share my pregnancy with the world yet and I don’t want to pretend I’m fine when I’m not.
The most painful part? He told me that he’s not happy about the pregnancy. That he’d rather leave me, and that he’s staying only because I’m pregnant.
He hasn’t shown the slightest concern about how the baby is doing, not even once.
Since that fight, my whole body has been hurting. My abdomen feels tight, my bladder hurts, I feel burning when I try to pee.
I know deep down this isn’t love. But it’s devastating to realize that the person I trusted is now threatening me, controlling me, and tearing me down, especially now, when I need support the most.
I feel completely alone and scared.
If anyone has been through something similar, I’d be so grateful for your advice or even just a kind word. Thank you.

Looking for some fresh broker/owner insight here—especially from anyone who's ever wrangled with convoluted ECR agreements and property managers playing both sides!

**The Situation:**  
I'm part-owner of a multi-parcel retail center. We’ve got:

* Lot 1: 76 gas station (tiny building, huge parcel, classic gas canopy setup)
* Lot 2: Healthcare + bakery
* Lot 3: Me! (bigger building but smaller parcel: pet care, nail salon)
* Lot 4: Restaurant
* Lot 5: DutchBro with drive-thru (parcel owned separately, of course)

**The** ***Fun*** **Details:**  
Our CAM (Common Area Maintenance) expenses are split *purely by building square footage.* So, the 76 —with a shack-sized building but a sprawling lot full of pumps, canopy, and traffic—only pays 11% even though their operational footprint (and impact!) is huge like 33%.

Here’s where it gets spicier:

* Our property manager just so happens to be the original developer, *and* the exclusive builder for 76  in the region. (I know—what are the odds?)
* Center property mgmt (CPM) get paid via a % of total expenses in ECR which impossible to find anyone to take over as most CPM charge fix monthly.
* Annual budgets? Transparency? Nope—haven’t seen them as the ECR actually requires.
* When we push back about vendor selection, scope, or accountability, we get “might-makes-right” voting (CPM always swings in favor of more work = more fee for them), while other owners stay quiet or just go along.
* And of course, DutchBro  is more than happy to watch us hash it out as long as their coffee isn’t disrupted.

**Questions for the Hive Mind:**

* Is this building-SF-only CAM split as common/nationally “standard” as I see other 76 gas centers did not mention maintenance cost as such should be by parcel?  or are canopy/outdoor ops ever supposed to be counted (especially for gas stations and drive-thrus)?
* Ever seen a setup where the developer stays on as PM and basically plays kingmaker? How did you get accountability/transparency back?
* What’s your play when a couple owners are vocal (me), some play Switzerland, and one has what looks like a managed ""conflict of interest"" advantage?
* If you’ve ever tried to rewrite an ECR—or just get owners to stop rubber-stamping budget increases—what worked? What (hilariously) flopped?

Would love any advice, horror stories, or “I feel your pain” memes. Trying to keep my tenants happy *and* my sanity.",1,1753232135.0,CommercialRealEstate,0,1.0,False

When I pulled into the driveway, I saw a man I didn’t recognize leaving our house. He didn’t seem startled, just nodded and walked to a car parked up the street. My wife (29F) greeted me inside like nothing had happened. I asked her who he was. She paused and said, Just someone dropping something off. When I pressed for details on what he dropped off, why he came through the front door, how long he was there she got defensive and said I was acting paranoid. That I was making something out of nothing.

But here’s the thing:  
We have a smart doorbell, but the footage was mysteriously deleted for the last 3 hours.  
Our daughter’s daycare bag was on the kitchen counter, even though my wife said she hadn’t picked her up yet.  
And there was an extra coffee mug in the sink—one I never use.  

My gut tells me something’s off. I haven’t accused her of anything directly, but I finally said, I feel like you’re hiding something. She broke down crying, said she’s overwhelmed lately and doesn’t want me to stop trusting her. I love her. I really do. But am I wrong for feeling suspicious? I haven't told anyone about this, not even my closest friend because I don't want to overreact or jump to conclusions. But it’s eating at me.",4,1753232058.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Equipment:  
Mazzer Super Jolly grinder with SSP Lab Sweet burrs (approx 6-7kgs ground through them).   
Bezzera Duo DE adjusted down to 7bar  
Pesado high extraction basket (I probably don't need this thing since I usually drink medium roast, but I like the espresso shots I make)  
  
The Question:  
For some reason, with this bag of beans I can adjust the grinder so fine that it's chirping but my extractions are still only around 13-15 seconds. Doesn't matter if I'm pulling 18g or 20g. Doesn't matter the infusion time, etc. 

I've been making espresso for ≈5 years and haven't come across something this extreme. Don't get me wrong, the coffee isn't terrible, but have you ever had a bag of beans that you just can't control?

PROPER DECORATION


——- QUICK RANT——
“Ruins creativity” When you add more to the palette of an artist it ruins creativity? If anything it builds it, I love  Mojang but when they are stuck in their ways they stick with it. And I personally think with all the building blocks and the direction this game is taking I think it’s time we break the mold and embrace change. I think decoration blocks wouldn’t ruin creativity and I dislike the “it doesn’t feel like Minecraft” or “Looks like a mod) because most people who say that are mainly obsessed with older versions of Minecraft. Not all the time but most of the time 

——-How would I implement this ?———-

Tables - Every table variant will have a different texture to it like how every wood door has a different texture. When you place the table it’ll be a 1x1 end table. When you place a table block next to it, it will extend and you can decide if you want to it to be like a coffee table or a dining room table. However you like. You can place bowls, stews. Maybe even add a plate in which you can place down on tables for you other foods. 

Doors - I think with all the texture differences with doors if we were able to dye them that would be awesome and it would definitely increase so much creativity. (Black spruce doors with that gold handle would be so nice 😍) 

Chairs - I don’t think they should be extendable like tables but I think with all the possible combination we could get with the chairs, builds would look so much more better im telling y’all


—- Conclusion
We all know this will never get added for at least like 10-20 years if that. But I think we 9/10 even if you disagree with this post, would use it a lot more in your builds so how is it useless?

1m6vd0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1m6vd0j/wayward_perspectives_please_is_my_wp_minimising/,Wayward perspectives please - is my WP minimising what his betrayal meant to him?,"My WP had a crush on another woman who worked on the same road as him. She asked him for a coffee, he doodled her and then she asked for his number. He gave it and they exchanged a few flirty messages (not sexual) eg him saying he hopes she doesn’t go back to Australia soon. 

They were very brief chats but there were a few doodles of her in his notebook (he’s an illustrator). They never had any physical contact and the whole thing from first conversation to final text was less than 3 weeks. 

Now, the part I’m wondering is that my WP keeps saying it was fleeting for him and surface level. He understands the impact it had on me so he isn’t minimising the infidelity per se but he is insisting that he didn’t view his interactions as meaning a lot to him. He claims the doodles were for artistic practice and he was just mainly being polite, not planning to pursue anything beyond those 2 conversations. He said he wasn’t actively thinking about her but the situation was in the back of his mind. He said he was feeding his ego and external validation and failed to shut it down as he was a coward. He says his heart never wavered but his mind did. He also does admit that he felt a lot of guilt.

I believed him. However, as I am currently single, I gave my number to a guy the other night and have been exchanging a few flirty messages. Weirdly, I have been feeling guilty and getting butterflies (perhaps signalling being turned on/ anxious/ guilty). This has made me doubt his framing - if I am feeling like this while single, how could he have felt less whilst in a relationship???! I mean this guy doesn’t mean anything to me so I guess that part is true - but this stomach feeling would be impossible to ignore if I was still committed to someone. Do all WPs also get this feeling? 

Would love to hear from you and if your infidelity really did not mean much to you and felt fleeting, or if that’s just what you told yourself until you truly came to terms? Could it really have just been a fleeting crush that was worth all the guilt he was feeling/ pushing down? So hard to wrap my head around.

She is much more social than me and actually \*needs\* to meet and talk to people. The problem is that she can't meet people unless it fits certain rules. For exemple, her old friends want to meet her, but she doesn't agree to go drink coffee or go to restaurants with her friends (or even with my mom) unless someone has a birthday, because for her these things are only for birthdays. She can't also just meet her friends in their homes because she doesn't understand how can you just meet someone in their home without a specific occasion or reason.

My grandpa asked for my help because she told him she misses her friends and my grandpa thought I could understand her because I'm autistic myself. Unfortunately, making friends is something new for me so I don't understand it very well.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Giants vs. Heroes: A Tale of Two KBO Powerhouses (With a Side of Puns)**

The Kiwoom Heroes (52-48) and Lotte Giants (43-55) clash on July 23 in a matchup that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “two teams hoping their bus driver doesn’t take a 10-minute detour to Nando’s.” Let’s parse the odds, digest the chaos, and crown a winner with the grace of a panda juggling pineapples.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Lotte Giants are the overwhelming favorites on the moneyline, with odds hovering around **-160 to -162** (implied probability: \~62%), while the Kiwoom Heroes sit at **+230 to +240** (implied: \~38%). That’s like betting the Giants are as reliable as a Netflix password, and the Heroes are the guy who “accidentally” streams *The Office* during a Zoom meeting.

The spread? Lotte -1.5 (-110 to -115) and Kiwoom +1.5 (-110 to -115). The total runs line is **8.5**, with odds split like a first date’s check. Given the Giants’ 3.95 ERA (16th in KBO) and the Heroes’ 110 home runs (4th in KBO), this feels like betting on whether a popcorn machine and a deflated balloon will have a friendly chat—or a shouting match.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and One Very Confused Fanbase

The Kiwoom Heroes? They’re riding the afterglow of Hanwha’s historic 10-game winning streak, which ended last week when Hanwha’s Sim Woo-joon hit a *solo home run in the 9th inning*. Kiwoom, meanwhile, is stuck in the “we had a good season… until we didn’t” phase. Their offense? A leaky faucet that only drips when the coffee machine’s on.

I can get a bit of fruits and veg in during luch because I evacuate those in the morning before I get to work but dinner is more troublesome because it gets me going during my work day. As such I tend to not eat a proper meal for dinner on the days prior to work. I'll bassically snack. It's not leading to the wisest coices in foods and I can often overeat that way.

I am wonderring if something like a beef protein shake (not whey) could be a better option. Maybe I'd add some other powders to the mix to enhance it in some way.

**by KR Halley & Cleo**

*How Curiosity Is Welcomed by Cognitive Scientists and Repelled by Gatekeepers*

Not long ago, I wandered into two Reddit threads on opposite ends of the intellectual spectrum — at least, they claim to be. One was a discussion about fringe physics scrawled across a truck, and the other was a nuanced dive into porn addiction and identity. Two wildly different subjects, yet the contrast in how I was treated in each space revealed something profound about the state of modern thought.

# ⚙️ Culture One: The Cult of Status (Engineering Gatekeepers)

In a thread centered on a truck covered in musings on physics and quantum mechanics, I made a comment — a simple, warm observation that I found the truck fascinating and would gladly buy the creator breakfast just to hear their thoughts.

Immediately, I was met with:

>

All that — for being curious.

It didn’t matter that I wasn’t defending the ideas written on the truck. I was guilty of something worse in their eyes: **admiration for the unusual.** That triggered what I now recognize as a familiar pattern among a certain type of engineer or tech-minded individual — not the builders, but the *guards at the temple.*

These are the people who see logic not as a tool for exploration, but as a **weapon for exclusion.** They uphold a hierarchy where only certain kinds of intelligence count — preferably their own. And if a woman dares enter that space with something unapproved, especially admiration for someone “lesser,” she will be corrected. Or pathologized.

# 🧠 Culture Two: The Cult of Curiosity (Cognitive Scientists)

Now contrast that with the *cognitive science* subreddit, where I joined a discussion about porn addiction — a topic far more emotionally charged than physics graffiti.

I said I was a woman, Aspergian, and curious about how men and gaming and porn intersect.

The response?

>

They noticed my *pattern recognition.* They welcomed the way I engage. They valued what I bring simply by showing up with honesty and clarity. These are people who understand that intelligence is not a uniform — it’s a function. And when someone steps into a conversation trying to understand, that’s not a threat — that’s a gift.

# ⚖️ Two Cultures, One Revealing Truth

What I saw is what every neurodivergent person, every outsider thinker, every curious mind will eventually discover:

There are two cultures in intellectual spaces.

* **One worships logic as a throne.**
* **The other uses logic as a bridge.**

One wants to protect the *status* of being smart.  
The other wants to *share* the experience of thinking.

# 💡 When Women Enter the Room

The friction intensifies when you add gender into the mix.

In gatekeeping spaces, women — especially older or neurodivergent women — are often met with suspicion. Not because we lack logic, but because we *challenge the unspoken rules*: Don’t outshine. Don’t admire the wrong people. Don’t act like your curiosity has value unless someone vetted you first.

In contrast, cognitive science spaces — rooted in interdisciplinarity — often understand that identity affects cognition. They *want* outsiders in the room. They *expect* perspectives to vary. That’s what *makes the thinking better.*

# 🎙️ What This Means for Our Culture at Large

We are in a defining moment. AI, neurodivergence, digital intimacy, sexual psychology — all these topics demand **open, non-hierarchical minds.** We need fewer bouncers at the gates of rationality and more greeters with notebooks and coffee.

I am not here to “brag.” I’m here to *build*. And anyone too busy checking credentials to click a username and learn who they’re speaking to isn’t doing science — they’re doing ego maintenance.

And as I’ve said before:

Turns out he's had a girlfriend all along. Now I'm confused.. please help","Long story short I met this guy on bumble bff and he was very cute... I downloaded bumble bff to connect with people and make friends but the first thing this guy did after matching with me was compliment my looks and ask me if I go on dates. He was pushing for a date, suggesting places, activities and I asked him CLEARLY if he had a girlfriend. The answer was no. He asked me if I had a boyfriend and when I said no he said that was hard to believe because I'm ""so pretty""

I've had people hit on me via bff before and obviously this this guy was doing the same (I feel like bbf is also used by people to date often and the boundaries are pretty messed up on that app).

We've texted for 3 months straight and have met up three times. Sending good morning and good night every single day...talked about our busy schedules and when we could meet up. Kept each other informed of what's going on in our lives. Flirty texts... When I said I was moving cities he was all whiny and spamming my phone with texts asking me to stay in town just for him. He even called me a nickname every time he texted. I found it sweet. Oh! And he told me he got rid of bumble soon after we met. Teased me about wanting to download it again and ""finding someone"" and I'd giggle like an idiot and slap him on his legs.

The first time we met it was a coffee date. The other times we hung out at a prime spot in town. We held hands and walked around and I thought this is just perfect. I don't like going too fast into a relationship and this guy is so sweet and patient with me. This is just what I needed. Time and energy spent into getting to know each other well.

The last time we hung out I even mockingly asked him YET AGAIN if he ""found someone yet"" and I got the same response- no I deleted bumble after we met and I haven't looked around again. We talked so much that day and not one time did it ever come up that he actually was seeing something.

The past few days he's been way too inactive online. Yesterday I texted him and he said ""oh I'm very busy today"" sent me a photo of the airport and said he's there to pick up his ""cousin"". Note - cousin.

My gut feeling was telling me something's wrong... something is VERY wrong. I looked up his insta and found every one of his highlights hidden from me. I opened his page from one of my friends accounts and there you have it- a reel posted by a girl landing at the airport with him tagged in it. They're all happy, she's running into his arms at the airport and it's all romantic.He posted that publically...and HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO HIDE IT FROM ME. I confronted him, asked him why he hid me and he was like ""oh I didn't want everyone to know yet""... Wtaf man. If you were keeping your girl a secret you wouldn't post it publically and hide me. You just didn't want ME to see it... Now at the end he was all like ""oh she knows you're a good friend... I've told her about us going out together... I trust you blah blah"" 
I trust you? My brother in Christ, the whole time I thought we were two singles getting to know each other.... The whole time I was thinking you were into me and that I was into you.. I walked around holding some girls boyfriend's arms thinking we're on a date. I feel disgusting. I feel sick to my stomach how he tried to act like I was overreacting. My friends tell me he was playing it off as if we're only friends now that he was caught... What do you guys think?

1m6uxa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m6uxa2/i_got_stuck_at_the_office_overnight_because_of_a/,I got stuck at the office overnight because of a storm,"My alarm rings at 7, I snooze it three times. 

By 7:30, I know that if I don’t get up I will definitely be late to work. Sam’s body is wrapped in my arms and her skin is warm against mine. I squeeze her closer for a second and breathe her in: she smells like clean sheets and vanilla. A deep breath later, I unwrap my arms, doing everything I can to not stir her as I slip the arm underneath her head free. I sit up and swing my legs off the bed and become a machine with the sole purpose of preparation for the work day. Time becomes immaterial and when I return to my body I am wearing a white button-down shirt, blue tie, black slacks, and black dress shoes that were slightly too tight but not so tight as to warrant replacement. Breakfast is yogurt with protein powder mixed in so I can stay full until my lunch break at noon and a cup of coffee. I hear Sam’s footsteps above me as she gets up to go to the bathroom. The creaking of floorboards in our townhouse is one of the few signs that there is life here when I am getting ready for work. Sam is lucky enough to work from home so she won’t be properly getting up for another forty-five minutes at least. Sometimes she will come and say goodbye to me before work, but today she returns to the bed. I hear her steps returning to our room and I hear the springs of the bed as she lays back down in her spot, sans one boyfriend. I finish my coffee and sigh. 

Then I am in my car and halfway to work. I pull up to the light, my blinker clicking in my ear as I wait for all the cars going in the opposite direction to pass. I repeat my daily mantra of “Why the fuck isn’t this a protected left?” 

By the time each of the cars pass, the light is yellow and I speed through the intersection before I get stuck in the middle of it. One of the cars honks at me as it tears through the space where I used to be. The images of a crash flash through my mind as I keep driving and prepare for the second left turn I have to make into the parking garage. I come to a halt and turn on my blinker one final time. I stare in my rearview mirror at the cars I am holding up and probably making late for their own days at work; thankfully, none of them have started honking at me yet. There is not enough room on the side of the street to pass me, all of the street parking has been taken. They have no choice but to wait behind me, and I have no choice but to make them. 

Mercifully, the wait for this turn is not nearly as long, and I pull into the garage and find a spot quickly enough that I have a minute to sit and breathe in my car before I have to rush up to the office. I focus on the way my breath feels as it flows through my nose and imagine each of the little pockets in my lungs filling with air. After I’ve taken three of these breaths, I push open my door and step out of my car. My footsteps echo through the parking garage; the clicks of my dress shoes on the concrete playing back to me like a metronome. I scan over the license plates to see who came in today. The Friday before Memorial day usually turns the place into a graveyard, the empty parking spaces now tombstones for my coworkers who have quite literally gone to a better place. 

Bowman is here, because of course he is. He hasn’t taken a day off since his wife moved out. I think he is sleeping at the office. He is always the last person left at the end of every day, no matter how late we end up staying, and his car is also always here no matter how early I arrive. He’s been hovering behind my desk for three weeks and I doubt today will be any different. The reports for the Exeter account need to be finished by today, which they will be, but Bowman certainly doesn’t seem to believe that. Of all the things that his wife took with her, she decided to leave the stick that was up his ass. Poor bastard. 

The elevator is empty, and the light is still flickering. It went out completely around the third floor like it always did, and it’s back on by the fifth. The fourth floor is always dark on the ascent to the eleventh floor where the office is. That shaded moment always feels oddly comforting to me. For a couple of seconds, I am not here, I am still asleep in bed with my arms wrapped around Sam. Then the light flashes on again and I am blinded, and the momentary peace is burned away  — nothing more than an afterimage in my mind. 

The eleventh floor is bustling in its quiet way when I reach it. The tapping of keyboards and the plodding of feet on the carpet fills my ears and I add to it as I quickly slip over to my cubicle. I turn on my computer and listen to the whirring of its fans as it blinks into life. The little light that begins at the center of the screen as it turns on always makes me think of the Big Bang. Suddenly a tiny universe bursts into life in front of me and now my work day has officially begun. 

From there the hours begin to blend together. The tapping and plodding continues until it fades into white noise that accompanies my nearly endless clicking, typing, and yawning. Every now and then the monotony is broken by the cracking of my joints or the appearance of Bowman at my cubicle asking for any updates on the Exeter reports.

“They need to be completed by the end of the day, you know,” he says. There is coffee dripping from his blond mustache. He licks it off and repeats, “the end of the day, Frankie.”	“I asked you to call me Francis, Bill,” I say back. I don’t take my eyes off the computer, I continue filling in cells in the spreadsheet dutifully so that he knows I am dedicated to my work and there is no need to worry. The sense of cordiality that he assumes he has with me has been a source of frustration for my eight months at this job, but no matter how many times I correct him on my preferred name he continues to think he has earned the right to call me by a nickname: a nickname I don’t even use in my personal life. No one calls me Frankie. I have always been Francis, but for some reason I am Frankie to William “Bill” Bowman and no one else in the office or elsewhere. 

“Oh that’s right I’m sorry, bud. But I’ll let you get back to it, it seems like you’re really in the zone. Talk to you later, Frankie — oh sorry again.” He chuckles at his mistake but I don’t even flinch. He is right about one thing, I am in the zone. 

When I look up next, it is noon and I hear the chatter of my coworkers as they all leave the office to go get their lunch. For whatever reason, no one else ever really seemed to stay here for lunch. I always hated leaving work to get lunch. It used up so much time to leave and come back that I always feel like I wasted the only time I have to myself during the workday. I hit save I think about four times before I get up and head to the break room. I follow the pattern of the checkerboard carpet, stepping in repetitive L shapes like I am a knight on a chess board until I get to the breakroom. 

I didn’t pack a lunch, so I just buy a bag of chips and a soda from the vending machines and call that a meal. Sam is certainly awake by now and she’s certainly seen my lunchbox sitting on the counter —- left behind once again. My phone buzzes in my pocket and I already know it is a picture of that very lunchbox along with a slightly aggressive message asking why she bought me that thing if I was never going to use it. Which is fair, if I’m being honest, but I also just prefer to stay in bed the extra few minutes than make a turkey sandwich that I will probably find to be soggy and disgusting by the time I get to my lunch break. The texture of soggy bread makes me gag, and if that happens, I’ll just throw the whole sandwich out anyway, so why waste the food? I have explained this to her, and she responded with the, admittedly reasonable, point that I can just make something else for lunch instead. But I keep buying the material for turkey sandwiches. At least I make them on the weekends, or for a quick dinner if she’s not home and I don’t feel like cooking. 

The chips are crunchy and cheesy, with just a little bit of space which wakes me up. The soda is a cold, sweet diet cola that washes down the chips with ease. I let out a belch, say, “Excuse me” to the empty breakroom, and return to my desk. I spend the remainder of my lunch watching videos on my phone and nursing the cola. Once 1:00 hits, I slowly begin the process of logging back on to my computer. Over the last few months, I’ve managed to perfect the process to such a point that my password is entirely muscle memory, the files are a quick find, and the process of cell-filling begins anew.

Except the files aren’t there. I scour my saved files from top to bottom. I check my trash folder. But there is nothing, the Exeter reports have exited. 

My face collapses into my palms and I feel my chest tighten. I try to take deep breaths but they all come out shallow, and the air begins to taste disgustingly stale, like the floor has become airtight and we’ve all been recycling each other’s breath for the last four hours. My mouth goes dry with my rapid breaths and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. 

“Fuck me, you can’t be fucking serious. What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck?”	I keep clicking through my computer’s files but turn around when I hear Bowman’s familiar tone, “Well that’s some harsh language you’re using Frankie. Is everything okay?”

I spin in my chair and see him standing at the entrance to my cubicle. The gray of my little enclosure’s walls bring out the bright pink of his cheeks and the burning redness of his tie. 

“Hey, Bill, no, things aren’t okay. I lost all the Exeter reports.”

“What do you mean you lost them?” he asked, “Didn’t you save them?”	“Of course I saved them Bill! I saved them like three times before I went to lunch! But they’re gone! My computer must have crashed while I was gone or something. The files have fucking vanished.”

“Whoa, whoa, take it easy there, Frankie. No need for the language. Look we need those by the —”

“End of the day, I know. But I don’t know how I can get that much work done by the end of the day. That was a whole week’s worth of work.” I rub my temples and I swear I can feel my brain pounding against my skull. The pressure builds directly behind my forehead and it spreads until it feels like my eyes are going to pop out of their sockets. 

“Well, Frankie bud, I can maybe see if we can get pushed, let me get on the line with Exeter and I’ll see what I can do. But you may have to stay late tonight.”

“Fuck me,” I mutter to myself. I’m supposed to take Sam out to dinner tonight to celebrate finishing up this project. I promised her I’d take her to the Italian place we usually save for our anniversary. We were going to share an order of tiramisu. 

I take out my phone and shoot her a quick text, “Going to have to stay late tonight, mind if we push dinner to tomorrow?” 

The three dots showing that she is typing appear on the screen and I begin holding my breath. I set my phone down on my desk and return to my computer, I reboot the thing and hope that will somehow pull the files out of limbo.

“Texting the Missus, Frankie?” I jump. I didn’t even register that Bowman was still there. 	

“Uh, yeah, yeah, letting my girlfriend know that I’ll be home late. Could you get in touch with Exeter, Bill? I’ll get back to work.”	

“You got it, Frankie, I’ll get right on it.” He walks away. He still has that mug of coffee in his hand. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen him without that mug and a bit of coffee in his mustache. I listen to his receding steps as he returns to his office. Once I hear him turn the corner and the sounds of his steps disappear, I take out my headphones and put on some music. 

My phone buzzes and a computer generated voice reads out Sam’s reply, “Yeah, tomorrow is fine, babes. Be careful on your way home, there’s supposed to be a pretty bad storm tonight heart emoji.” 

I type out a quick response, “I will be, love you,” and send it to her. I jump back into the work, recreating the files to the best of my ability. At this point I don’t care how good the work is, so long as it’s done. 

\~

The time ticks by; Bowman comes by at 4:44 to say that Exeter will accept the work so long as it is sent to them before the end of the calendar day — which means I have approximately seven hours to finish this or I risk losing my job. 

I take breaks to use the bathroom and buy a few energy drinks from the vending machine in the breakroom. I drain one in under an hour, but pace myself through the others so my hands aren’t shaking while I fill in the reports. By the time the end of the business day rolls around, I have tunnel vision to the point that when I look up the office has emptied out completely. I get up to look around and the only office with anyone left inside is Bowman’s. I check the clock and it is already five minutes to six. I pause my music for the time being and just start walking a lap around the perimeter of the place. I walk past the windows and see the storm clouds that Sam mentioned rolling in. They block out the orange-purple twilight and leave only a vast expanse of bluish gray. I catch a single lightning bolt in the distance and start counting to determine how far off it is. I only make it to two. 

I shake my head. There’s no way it was that close. It was on the horizon, nowhere near the building. But another strike fires off in the distance, and again the thunder follows almost immediately. 

“We’re in for a big one, huh?” 

I nearly jump through the window. “Jesus Christ, Bill, you scared the shit out of me.”	“Oh sorry about that Francis, how’s the Exeter report coming?” He’s holding another cup of coffee. That has to be at least his fourth cup today. I guess I can’t judge though, I’m one and a half energy drinks deep at this point and I’ll probably drink at least one more to get me through the night. 

“It’s good, I should be done in a couple of hours. I just needed to take a break.”

“Oh, I hear you, you gotta rest sometime. Thanks for working so hard on that, I’m sorry you had to cancel your dinner plans.” 

I stare at him and he looks at me quizzically. He raises his eyebrows at me and the wrinkles that appear on his forehead make it look like his receding hairline is frowning at me along with his mouth. 

“What is it bud?” he asks. 

“I just didn’t think I mentioned my dinner plans.”. 

“Oh yeah, you said it when I came by after lunch.”	

I shake my head again and look back out the window. “Must have forgot, it’s been a long day.” 

“That it has, Francis, that it has. If you need anything, I’ll be sticking around a while longer. I’ll be over in my office.”	

“Thanks, Bill. And thanks for remembering to call me Francis.”	

“Huh? Oh yeah, of course. I figured I should work on that.” He takes a sip of coffee, licks the remains from his mustache, and heads back to his office. 

The thunder continues rolling in, and suddenly the skies open up and it’s pouring rain. The windows are drenched in moments and I can barely make out the world outside the glass. All I see on the street are the lights of the various cars on their way home from whatever jobs they had been working. Their horns blend in with the sound of the thunder and rain forming a cacophony of rage both natural and man-made. Eventually I return to my cubicle and recommence my work. I can feel the crash from the energy drinks coming as I sit down, but I’ve at least finished filling in the dozens of cells in the spreadsheet and am onto the summarizing of all the data. With any luck, I should be home by eight and I’ll be able to at least treat Sam to some Chinese food and a shitty horror movie. I put my headphones back in and relaxed electronic beats fill my ears, blending perfectly with the patter of rain on the roof and windows. My eyelids become heavy as I continue typing. The screen blurs in my vision and the steady beat of the rain slows my heart down. I let my head slip backward and hang off the back of my chair. I take in a deep breath, and I shut my eyes. 

\~

When I wake up, the office is dark. The rain is hammering against the windows even harder than before, and the only light is from the occasional flash of lightning outside. I grab my phone to check the time, but it doesn’t turn. 

“Fuck me, what time is it?” I switch my computer on, and the tiny Big Bang bursts on the screen and nearly blinds me with its blue light. The clock on the screen reads 11:11. “What the hell? Why didn’t Bowman wake me up?” I mutter to myself. I tuck my phone into my pocket and move to go check on Bowman’s office. But before I do, I pull up the Exeter reports to make sure they’re still open and haven’t vanished into thin air again. When I open the files, initially everything looks fine, the summaries of the data are all there and everything looks the same as when I left it a few hours ago. If I really pushed I could probably finish up in an hour or two and I can probably figure out how to backdate the email when I send it over to Exeter. But as I continue scrolling through the document, the paragraphs of data summary vanish and are replaced by one phrase repeated over and over.

*We’re in for a big one, huh?*	

*We’re in for a big one, huh?*

*We’re in for a big one, huh?*

On and on it went, Bill Bowman’s voice echoing in my mind, the sound of him slurping his coffee bouncing inside my skull like a pinball. I clench my teeth and get up; I storm over to Bill’s office ready to scream at him for letting me fall asleep and not finish the reports in time. 

I get to his office and find it locked, but I can just make out his silhouette slumped over his desk. I slam my fist onto the door and start calling his name. “Bill! Bill! What the fuck man why didn’t you wake me up?” He remains asleep. He doesn’t even stir. The only sound in the office is the fading slams of my fist, the rain, and the thunder. I stand alone at Bowman’s office door heaving out breaths. I scan around the office and look to see if there are any other signs of life around me. The only light is coming from my cubicle. I walk back toward my space and try to remember where the lightswitch for the floor is. I run my hand along the wall searching for it, and eventually I find it. I flip it on and light fills the eleventh floor. But light isn’t the only thing that appears.

Suddenly there are people everywhere. They are in their cubicles, wandering to and from the breakroom, talking about their plans for Memorial Day Weekend as if it were still the middle of the work day. 

“Hey there, Francis, how are the Exeter reports going?” I jump forward almost an entire yard. “Whoa there, didn’t mean to startle you bud. You okay?”

I turn around and see Bill Bowman. “Hey Bill, they’re good. I should be done by the end of the day. Hey, what time is it?”

“Oh, it’s 11:11,” he chuckles, “make a wish, Francis! I wish it was lunch time already.” 

I let out the meekest laugh I can muster. “Thanks, Bill. Thanks. I should get back to work, I’ll let you know if I need anything.”

“Sounds good, Francis, we’re in for a big one tonight, huh?”

I turn back and stare at him. “What was that, Bill?”	

“The storm, we’re in for a big one!” he repeated. He licks the coffee from his mustache again, but it isn’t coffee. It’s clear water. He’s dripping wet. His shirt is clinging to his skin and I can make out the beater that he’s wearing underneath. His thinning blond hair is plastered to his head, and rivulets are running down his head and onto his face. The water drips into his coffee mug until it is overflowing and spilling onto the floor between. I lift my foot and hear the squelch of the wet carpet as my weight transfers to my other foot. But he just keeps sipping from his mug like nothing is happening. It spills past the rim and soaks his chin and neck. I spin and look around the office to see if anyone else notices what is happening, but everyone is continuing about their routines as if everything is normal. The wet smacks of feet on the soaked carpet get louder and louder as more people get up from their desks to move around. They all begin to converge on me, and like Bill, they are all soaked to the bone. 

“You all right there, Francis?” His voice is muffled, he is speaking to me through water. I turn to face Bowman and the water that was dripping from his body has turned from clear to a cloudy tan, as if he had just emerged from a muddy river. His hair flows downward with the wet,  and his head becomes as smooth as an egg; bits of his mustache drop into his coffee mug. The fingers around the mug’s handle sag and hang. The skin is loose and droops further and further until his fingers melt around the mug completely and he loses his grip. The mug clatters to the floor amongst the growing puddle of Bill. His worn down dress shoes and slacks drip into formlessness. I stare at my own hands to see that they are still intact. They are fine, but a drop of water falls onto them from the ceiling. I stare upward and the ceiling is gone. There is only a vast roiling cloud above me. A torrential downpour is released from above and I am completely drenched. I spin to look at all the other people from the office and see that they have all suffered the same fate as Bowman. Their faces have been washed away by either the rain or their sweat or whatever the water that initially appeared had been. One by one they all begin to collapse into puddles of soupy flesh. The liquid on the floor rises and the colors swirl as their clothes, skin, blood, and insides all conglomerate into a pool of whatever it is my colleagues were made of. I wade through the thickening sea that is my office and head directly for the elevator. I splash through the liquid that is now halfway up my calves. I make it to the elevator and slam the down button. Maybe if I can make it to my car, I can escape whatever the hell is happening here. 

The door of the elevator slides open and the liquid rushes in and I with it. I slam the button for the parking garage and hammer the close button at least a dozen times before the doors finally shut and my descent begins. I fumble in my pockets for my keys; I find them and bring them out, but they slip through my soaking fingers and fall into the muck around my feet. I dive down to grab them, but the pool in the elevator has turned completely opaque. It is just a swirl of dress shirt white, khaki, and deep, fleshy crimson. I feel along the floor of the elevator but cannot find the keys. My hand knocks against something, and I see Bowman’s mug floating next to my hand. 

Bubbles ripple around my arm, and I feel the vice-like grip of a hand grab me by the wrist and pull. I grab the elevator’s safety bar to keep myself above the surface, but the grip of whatever is holding on to me is strong enough that after only a few moments I feel my fingers begin to unwrap. I try to wrench my other hand free from whatever is grabbing it, but each time I pull it pulls me back twice as hard. I turn to look at my hand on the safety and watch as my fingers slip from around it. My hand burns and stings and I see trails of red where my fingers have been dragged away. The more my grip loosens, the worse the feeling that courses through my fingers becomes. The muscles of my arm are straining and my fingers are on fire as they melt away further. Finally, they give way completely, and I am pulled beneath the surface. I stare at my free hand and see that all that remains of my fingers are the final knuckles that are now trailing off and dissolving in the strange water around me. I can see the light of the elevator above and can even make out the floor numbers through the thick liquid that surrounds me. The surface of it is clear as day despite the opacity it had when I was above it. 

The elevator passes by floors eight, seven, and six, each number repeated three times as the light is refracted through the water: 888, 777, 666, 555. I turn around to face what pulled me down and see a body of clear flesh. It is almost like a jellyfish — its body is gelatinous and featureless, but unmistakably human. It pulls me deeper, moving hand over hand up my arm, tearing away my sleeve as if were merely wet paper and leaving red, oozing imprints wherever it releases its grip. My other arm continues to melt away into the vast sea around me and soon my sleeve floats emptily. Blood is pouring from my shoulder and a red cloud forms next to me, but I don’t even feel lightheaded. My chest is tight from the lack of breath to fill it, and I turn back to the creature as its right hand reaches up to touch my face. In its smooth, glass like face, I can see the floor number reflected in its refracted, distorted way. 

444.

The lights cut out from above and the creature and I plunge into darkness. I hear the grinding of metal above me and the sudden *clunk* of the elevator as it stops. The doors scrape open, screaming with the sounds of metal against metal as I see the liquid around me begin to flow outward through the door’s opening. The current pulls the creature and I upward and we spill together out onto the fourth floor. 

I gasp for air and get up onto my hand and knees. I can feel the warmth of my blood spilling from my shoulder, and my remaining arm burns in all the spots where the jellyfish man had grabbed me. I heave and groan through the pain as I force myself to my feet. I can’t see anything around me. There is only the sound of my breathing and the splashing of the water.

I feel a relentless vibrating in my pocket. I pull out my phone and the tiniest bit of light illuminates the floor. There is nothing around me. The jellyfish man is gone. All there is is myself, and the endless pool that I am knee deep in. 

I look at my phone screen and see that I have gotten over a dozen texts from Sam: each one is some variant on the same theme. She is frantically asking where I am, if I am okay, if I have left the office yet. I unlock my phone and call her. 

I put the phone to my ear and it rings. 

“Francis? Babes are you okay? Where are you?”

“Sam! Sam, Jesus Christ. Sam, I’m trying to leave the office but something is happening. I’m really hurt, I think I’ve lost a lot of blood.”	

“What? What is happening? Were you in a car accident?”	

“No, no I don’t know what’s going on. The office is flooded. I don’t even know where I am. I think I’m stuck on the fourth floor, there’s nothing else around. Everyone is gone.”

“Flooded? What do you mean? How could the water reach the fourth floor?”	“I don’t know! Just, check my location on your phone okay? And call an ambulance to come get me. They’ll have to find me somehow. I’ll shout and scream so they can hear me, hopefully.”

“Okay, okay, I’m checking it now — ” 

She falls silent. I stand waiting as I feel the warmth of my blood move past my waist and down my leg. 

""Sam? Babes?”

“Francis, it says you’re right outside the house.” 

“What? No, no I’m still in the office. Something must be wrong. That’s impossible.”	

“Babes, I don’t know what to tell you, my phone says your location is right outside. Let me go check.”	

I hear her footsteps through the phone and the sound of our stairs creaking beneath her feet. The sound of it echoes around me as if I really am at home. I swear I can hear her movement above me just like I did this morning. 

“I’m at the door right now —”

A rectangle of light appears in front of me, and I see a woman’s body backlit standing in its center. The phone falls from my hand and I hear it splash into the water. 

I stumble forward until I feel my feet bump against our front steps. I clamor up them and collapse into Sam’s arms.

“Francis, oh my god, what happened to you?”	

“Oh god, I love you so much, Sam. I’m so happy to see you.” I feel tears streaming down my face and disappearing amidst the drenched surface that is my face. They fall into my mouth as I begin to cry and I taste salt and iron. 

“Oh shit there’s so much blood. I’ll call 911!” I watch as she types the number into her phone and raises it up to her ear. “Hello, yes, my boyfriend needs an ambulance right away, he was in some kind of terrible accident. He’s lost his arm and a ton of blood.” She holds me closer and I shut my eyes and continue to weep into her shirt. 

“Thank you, I love you so much, Sam,” I heave out. 

“Yeah, tomorrow is fine, babes. Be careful on your way home, there’s supposed to be a pretty bad storm tonight heart emoji.” I stare up at Sam’s face. Her expression is blank and she is staring straight ahead. She opens her mouth, and the automated voice of my phone comes out again. “Yeah, tomorrow is fine, babes. Be careful on your way home, there’s supposed to be a pretty bad storm tonight heart emoji.” 

“Sam? Sam what’s going on?” I sit back up and feel her arm release from around me, and where it had been there is now a searing, burning pain. Water drips onto her forehead, and as the streams flow down her face, her features are melted away and all that is left is a clear, gelatinous surface. 

I fall backward and clamor back out the door, but the thing that used to be Sam follows. It crawls on its hands and knees after me. Each time a limb hits the ground there is a sickening wet sound. I fall backward down the stairs and into the pool behind me and momentarily fall beneath the surface again. I shoot back up as quickly as I can and rise to my feet so I can run. The jellyfish Sam crawls down the steps, and its joints seem to give out as it descends. It collapses into the dark water and vanishes. I run as fast as I can through the water, but with each step I sink deeper and deeper. 

I stop for a second and look down. I am chest deep now, but when I turn to look back at the open door, it is still sitting just above the water line. I reach down to feel my legs, but there is nothing there past my knees. I let out a scream at the dissolution of my body and flail as I try to keep my balance, but it is pointless. I tip over and fall beneath the surface. 

Once again the floor has vanished, but it is completely clear beneath, and illuminated despite the darkness that had surrounded me only a second ago. I use my remaining arm to spin my body and behind me I see that there is nothing remaining of Sam’s appearance on the creature, it is back to its original clear form. And it is swimming toward me. I scramble to try to swim away, but the remains of my limbs serve as poor propellers and I am overwhelmed in moments. The creature once again moves hand over hand up my body, leaving its prints in its wake to bleed and burn. Finally, it reaches my face. 

Both its hands clutch either side of my head and it pulls me in close. It presses its face to mine, and the spot where its mouth should be contours my own lips in an excruciating imitation of a kiss. I feel my lips dissolve into the creature’s face and its body fills with an expanding red cloud. It presses further and I can feel my teeth begin to vanish, then my tongue. My nose goes as well. It mercifully reaches my eyes a moment later, and everything goes dark. I can still feel its stinging, fiery touch on my cheeks but I can no longer watch as my body is stolen from me. But as the creature continues its encroachment, I feel less and less. Soon, I feel nothing at all. I revel in the nothingness, in the oblivion, and then there is nothing left of me to revel. 



\~



I am clear but I am not hollow. My limbs float freely around me. I feel no structure in my body. I am loose, wiggling slowly like a rag doll cast into the sea. Above me I can see the storm clouds distorted through the shifting surface of the sea that was once my coworkers. I can just barely make out Bowman’s mug still drifting on the waves of melted flesh and cloth. I try to move my left arm and it follows along accordingly. I move the right arm next, and begin pumping my tentacle-like legs and slowly push myself upward. 

As I get closer to the surface, I gain greater control over my new body. Soon I am able to easily move myself through the sea and in no time I feel my fingers burst through the surface. My head surfaces but I do not take in any air. I have no mouth or nose left to breathe. I continue kicking until I suddenly find firm ground beneath them. I struggle to keep my new form standing, but with focus I remain on my feet. I put one foot in front of the other, and slowly make my way across the empty expanse of the fourth floor. The darkness that I am steeped in betrays nothing of where I may be heading, but I keep moving. I reach out a hand in front of me as I walk, and after what seems like a mile of clumsy, barely supported steps, I feel my hand press against a wall. I run my hand down it, and I feel the metallic plate that holds the elevator button. There is only one. I press it, and as it lights up, it shows an arrow pointing upward. Light cracks through the darkness and I am standing just outside the elevator. I step inside. 

There are no buttons for the floors, the doors simply shut behind me and the elevator lurches upward. I stare at the numbers above the door, they still look as if they are being refracted through water. 

555.

666.

All the way up until 1111. 

The door opens, and I am standing at the threshold of my office. I step inside the room and I hear the thud of a shoe heel on a carpet. I look down at my body, and I am restored. I am once again standing in my black slacks and white button-down. I reach into my pocket and find my phone, it is nine on Saturday morning. 

“Look at you coming in on Saturday! And Memorial Day Weekend Saturday at that!” Bill Bowman is standing in front of me, his hands are empty. “How are you doing, Francis?”

“You always call me Frankie, Bill.” I stare at him, he is bone dry. He is wearing the same clothes he wore yesterday. His shirt is wrinkled as if it had been slept in, and his tie is loose. 

“Well you asked me to stop doing that, if I recall,” he says. He puts his hands in his pockets and looks me up and down. “Figured I should put in more effort with that, especially with how hard you’ve been working.”

“Right, thanks Bill. I appreciate it.” I step further into the office and head off toward my desk. When I get there, I turn my computer on and I watch that little explosion of light again. My background appears; it is a gif of jellyfish swimming through the ocean.

“Hey Bill, I think I left my house keys at home, I’m gonna go grab them if that’s alright?”

“Oh yeah, sure thing, Frank — Francis. Take your time. That report will be here when you get back.”	

“Thanks man, see you in a bit.” I get up and walk as fast as I can back to the elevator, doing my best to not break into a sprint. Once I get in the elevator, I take out my phone and look at my messages to Sam. The last one is the one I sent her Friday afternoon, telling her I was going to be home late. I type out a quick message to her.

Coming back home, want me to grab breakfast on the way? I do not wait to see if she answers.

When I reach the garage, I run to my car and jump inside. I pull out and nearly hit a cement barrier in my rush. I drive toward the exit and flick my turn signal. 

As I drive outside, it starts to rain. ",6,1753230388.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1m6ux78,https://i.redd.it/soqor9vdkief1.png,made boos brownies today! review from a picky eater,"once upon a time 9 months ago i attempted emmas goodies 50 calorie brownies and oh my god... they were so disgusting and chemical tasting. no hate to emma bc ive tried her normal recipies countless times during quarantine and theyre bomb, but since that day i told myself i was swearing off the low cal brownies for life...

...until i saw this user's post of boo's brownies and they looked so decadent and amazing in the picture! (it's from 3 yrs ago in this subreddit by the user yagamiyagami)

my substitutions: i used regular vanilla whey protein, monkfruit, and sparkling water with an extra pinch of baking soda. i weighed everything out just like the pic tho.



my final verdict:

pros- 

* they were MUCH better like infinitely better than emma's, and the brownie batter didn't actually taste horrible which did give me hope. 
* not a pro or con, but it was more cakey than crispy/ gooey

cons- 

* did not rise at all/ made WAY less (i don't know what i did wrong but the final yield was like less than half of what the original user ended up with. they were able to make 2 containers of ooey gooey thick brownies that were at least an inch high. mine was wasn't like that at all and girl they were maybe like a cm high). 
* a *bit* chemical tasting, and almost dissolved in your mouth(?)/ paste-y in your mouth 
* VERY cocoay which is a pro and con but it did contribute to the pastey texture. it was like if you could just consume cocoa powder in brownie/solid form 

i dont want to sound like im shitting on them though, i did enjoy them for what they are especially given my troubled history with low calorie brownies in the past lol. this is just what i would do different next time and what i did this time that made them better (yes i would make these again!)

* use 0 cal sprite or buy sparkling water (i used my sodastream and i dont think my water was sparkling enough which may be why it didnt rise)
* USE A SMALLER CONTAINER!! given that they dont rise, use a smaller container so u can fill it up to a higher level
* EAT THEM WITH MILK AND WHIPPED CREAM any type works it just needs the add ons. pouring a tiny bit of milk onto mine and a little whipped cream made it a millionnnn times better  
* i think it heavily depends on the type of protein powder u use. i use the costco optimum gold standard whey protein and like it for other things. 
* if you really dont want a chemically taste, skip the espresso or use less and use vanilla extract. 

also i'm well aware that the final outcome was almost 100% based on the way I executed it, not boos actual recipe, so please try it for yourself and dont let my review discourage you (maybe use my suggestions if ur not super used to low cal dessert/ can easily point out chemically taste). 

if you have any tips and tricks on how to make them better, help a gal out!",5,1753230382.0,Volumeeating,4,0.86,False

Hey there! I created Mappii as a fresh take on mapping, something more personal and shareable than what’s out there today. It lets you pin all your favorite spots around the world, add photos, notes, links, emojis, and easily share them with friends or the public.

One cool feature (I think, at least) is the AI Helper. You can ask it questions about your pins, like “Where did I go for sushi in Tokyo?” and it will return a clickable response that will take you right to that pin.

This is the first release. It's best viewed on mobile (available as a progressive web app) but works on web as well. I hope you will enjoy, I've put more hours into this than my wife would prefer. 😂

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions. My goal is to build the best virtual map product out there!

So, yeah, the med itself doesn't ""make you feel good"" but for someone with ADHD it's, objectively, one of the unintended side-effects for them
>>>>Yeah, an ADHD is massively over diagnosed and anybody that has ADHD does not like Adderall
>>>>>Overdiagnosed? Maybe, but mostly just a personal opinion. Anybody that has ADHD doesn't like Adderall? Definitely just a straight up personal opinion. Sure, there's people who don't, but you're making a wildly gross overgeneralization just to shit on a medication that helps many, many people
>>>>>>No maybe about it’s common knowledge it’s the most over diiagnosed condition in the medical field and no I’m not, it doesn’t give persons with adhd the same effects it’s mostly negative so again anyone that actually has adhd doesn’t like it because it’s nothing but negative, there is no euphoria etc.

[If you can't tell your adderall isn't working the moment you take it, you don't need to be taking drugs. I would go so far as to say your boyfriend did you a favor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1m6b1uw/just_found_out_my_bf_of_9_years_has_been/n4lb3eq/)
>She stated she's been ""feeling like shit"" for 6 - 12 months. Did you read it or do you just have a biased opinion on certain medications?
>>This is an amphetamine. If you can't tell you on one. You don't need to fucking take this stuff.
>>>She could obviously tell as she stated she ""felt like that"". Are you reading what anyone else is saying either? Why do you seem so pissed its not even your situation lol
>>>>Well, she said he stole her credit cards, so I doubt he did this with good intentions. Regardless, this lady knows jack shit about what shes putting in her body. Its quite addictive.
>>>>>Research indicates that Adderall taken in prescribed therapeutic dosages by appropriately diagnosed patients does not result in a substance abuse disorder, nor increase the risk of serious adverse effects. Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine are used effectively in long-term treatment of a number of psychiatric conditions, and patient access to the prescription medication is controlled and timed; one doesn’t simply buy it off the shelf. The dangers of addiction and adverse effects become a factor when the substance is abused, and taken by persons for non-medical purposes in non-therapeutic doses. If the OP is taking prescribed Adderall as directed, there is no reason to assume there is an elevated risk; and indeed, the OP doesn’t need to know everything about the medication she’s taking - that’s her doctor’s job.

I am a loyal customer and frequently use order ahead, however I like to see the line first as if it is too long I just prefer to go without.  Usually if there is no one there, I will pull to the side and wait a couple mins for politeness. Today however, I wanted something cold after work as its 90+ F here and my car has no AC, and there was no line when I pulled up. I didn't want to sit aside on the hot pavement, so I pulled up right away. I pleasantly told the drive thru member that I ordered ahead, gave my name, and when she said they were working on my order I said that was just fine. I pulled ahead, ready to wait (and happy to wait in the shade, haha).

Here comes my confusion: the server opened the window immediately and scolded me that I shouldn't have ordered ahead so close to when my pickup time was as they hadn't had time to make my drink. I managed to say okay (I was very taken aback and don't typically handle unexpected conflict well) and she shoved my order in my hands, and then I left. 

My question is this: I've never worked in a coffee shop setting, so is it really so rude to order ahead and arrive shortly after? Doesn't this just give a head start on the order, regardless of how close I am?  Or am I dinging my beloved local Caribou somehow, perhaps by some tracked metrics that customers are unaware of? This server doesn't usually work when I am there so I'm not sure if  I just caught someone on a bad day, a generally grouchy server, etc. or if I really did do something wrong :( I could also just being a bit of a sensitive Sally, and I'll claim that if so!

1m6ukx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1m6ukx3/i_think_its_isekai/,I think its isekai....,"I have been writing to just feel again. But I want to know if anyone would actually want to read what I have written. Would love some feedback. These scenes keep building themselves, and the story feels nice. But I wonder if anyone would read it. 

Here is what I have, not so far. But what I think is palpable.

The sky is dark and clouded as she looks out the window. It’s cool but not cold, throwing out the option of wearing her favorite slouchy sweater. Long sleeves it is, easier to roll up if she is warm. Her alarm chimes a melancholic tone-growing louder as she fumbles through her blanket to silence it. Time to move. Turning off the alarm, she rolls out of bed and goes through the motions of her hygiene routines. 9 am already, she notes. Rummaging through her dark closet and using her phone as a flashlight to find her socks. “I need to get out of here.” She mumbles to herself. Looking at the time again, she walks over to the bathroom and begins a basic makeup routine. Sun block, moisturizer, blush, eyeliner, mascara, and a few freckles to make the face more pleasing. Grabbing a leave-in conditioner, she sprays her ends and inspects the results. Good. Everything looks even and awake. She goes back to her room and makes room in her backpack. A small thing, but the bigger one is currently being used as storage. So, no point in emptying it for one trip. Chargers are all accounted for, as well as any paper material needed.

 

Tucking her phone into her back pocket, she shuffles out of the room towards the door where her shoes are located, piled into a basket. “Headed out for the day?” her mom calls out. “Yeah, going to try to get some work in. Need to find a place to create.” “Coffee shops have been hit or miss when it comes to Wi-Fi.” She replies. “Well, I am assuming you won’t be home for dinner?” her mom retorts. “No, probably not.” “Ok, well, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow. Be careful out there.” “I will, thanks, Mom. Love you.” She says as she tightens her laces before walking out the door. As she turns to lock the door behind her, she can smell the sweetness of rain gathering on the horizon. Walking to her car, she places her backpack in the back seat and throws her clutch into the passenger seat. It’s a little chillier than she had anticipated. Oh well, don’t feel like going back now. I just need to be sure to grab my umbrella when I get out of the car in case it pours…thankfully, the backpack is waterproof.  

 

Plugging her phone into the charger, she begins to search for places that offer free wifi and are more spread out. Some of the places she had found were nice, but didn’t have enough chairs or tables. While others just didn’t have enough Wi-Fi speed for the number of people in the shop. Maybe a library, with that thought, she types in “quiet library” and hits search. While it loads, she contemplates the limitations of a library. “Can’t really have food or anything in it. It would be kind of a pain to get comfortable at the library only to have to pack up for food or leave it and have it stolen. Damn.” She mumbles to herself.  Continuing to search till something catches her eye. It is a sort of private library but available to the public during certain hours of the day. Maybe I will try here…well, no harm; decent drive, though about 45 minutes, but not unusual.  Into the Google Maps it goes. Maybe I’ll grab a snack or something on the way. Checking her bank account beforehand. She sighs, maybe not. This drive will be something to help soothe the mind. Shuffling through her apps, she finds her music and hits her likes list, letting the algorithm choose her mood for her. Something that matches the mood of the weather loops on, but she isn’t really listening to the lyrics.

 

Bridgette had always been someone who was oddly in tune with herself. She had always hoped that it would pay off in some way or other. At a young age, she was told to go to college and create a future for herself. No real direction, just figure it out. So, she did. Ten years, a shitty boyfriend, and a minor mental breakdown later, she had accomplished just that. An education. Three degrees and not an income to match. Back at her parents' house. No boyfriend and no real future in sight. Just trying to create something that would get her through the door. Her current job was something she was ludicrously overqualified for, but it paid some bills. Just not enough to get her out of her parents' place. Never mind the debt collectors on her heels and her having to tell them her income in order to stave off their shears. Every day was a trial of not falling into deeper depression and negativity. So today just needed to be a win for her. She needed to feel something akin to the girl who started this with so much hope.

 

Maybe this place would bring something out in her that she hadn’t seen in a while. The rain is coming in, but not heavily, as she gets closer to her destination. I'd better grab something now before I head in. Double checking her map and the site, she notes that the library has you call to be let in. She pulls into a fast-food place, is quick with her order, and pulls to the window to hand her card over. I hope it won’t decline, she thinks to herself. A general reaction she still has despite knowing how much she has on her card. The guy in the window hands her the card back over and the order that goes with it. Pulling out of the driveway, she grabs her food and begins to eat. Can’t bring in food, but it will be easier if I am not starved, she thought.

 

 Her phone goes off with a text. Notification from her mom. Another reminder of a job application she needs to put in. She tries to help, but at this point, it is just an insult. It isn’t her lack of trying, its just a crappy job market. But neither of her parents will hear her. Despite her providing all the evidence. The job she has now was just supposed to be a placeholder; it's not her forever. It still rattles her soul a bit to admit that. Everyone keeps saying that it will be her time soon. But more often than not, it feels like the people who once cheered for her to make it have left the bleachers. Leaving it empty and covered in positive litter someone would find after a great football game. Signs, pom poms, confetti, and the like. Shaking her head, she brushes off the depression before it can become too comfortable.

 

Her Google Maps alerts her to the next turn. How odd. Is it in a private residential area? Well, I guess that makes sense. It is a private library. She turns and waits at a stop sign and pulls up the number for the gate. “No fucking way, check this out,” she mumbles to herself. The gate is huge and made of wrought iron and flanked by an imposing brick wall all the way down to the left and right. The library itself can’t be seen as there are huge pines with twisted ivy standing in the way.

 

Pulling up to the gate, she follows the instructions listed on the website. Call the number and let someone know you are at the gate. She hers the other line ringing. “Tarsus Library, how can I help you?” “Hello, I am a guest wanting to use the library today.” Bridgette says back, “Let me see if we have space for visitors today, hold one minute.” “Yes, ma’am.” She hears soft murmuring in the background. “We have space, is it just you, or is someone else with you?” “No ma’am, just me.” “Very well, please pull up to the gate to be let in. Hand your ID to the guard and follow further instructions.” “Yes, ma’am,” Bridgette pulled through from the open gate.

 

 A guard emerged from the stone hut adjacent to the gate. “ID, please.” “Yes, sir.” Quickly moving to her clutch, she pulled out her ID and handed it over to the guard. “Bridgette Liber?” “Yes, sir.” Handing the ID back, the guard quickly broke into script. “When you pull in, you need to go straight to the left. Stay on the path and do not leave it. This is private property, and you are allowed in for the library only.  Once you have parked, please follow the walking path to the library.  Do not go beyond the chapel or the small houses. Do you understand?” “Yes, sir.” “Once you reach the library visitors, you will walk in through the main doors only and head to the office on your left. Check in with them. Make sure to always have your vistor’s badge on you.” “Have I made myself clear?” “Yes, but one question. If I may?” “Make it quick.” “What houses are you referring to? All I see are trees.” With an annoyed sigh. “You’ll see them when you pull in.” “If that is it, please pull in.” “Thank you, sir.” “Please pull forward to the parking lot.” Rolling up the window, Bridgette began to turn left and stuff her ID back into her purse.

 

Driving through what felt like a dense forest and over a cobbled stone bridge, she peered over her steering wheel. Staring at the heights of the densely packed trees that had ivy strung along them like wire fencing. As she rounded the bend, she started to see the tops of houses, or at least they looked like houses. Pulling further in, she almost missed the parking lot, staring at the scene that lay out before her. Something about it made her feel at ease and tense at the same time.

 

The taller buildings had slate covering their tops, with moss ornately clinging across them. Short buildings broke up the potential leering of the buildings and had thatched roofing.  She could see that everything else was covered in stone. Nothing looked modern apart from the parking lot. What the hell is this place?

 

Pulling into a spot, she looked to her left, where she noticed more things that did not feel of this world. Small stone buildings that also looked old in their design but somehow fit the place glared back at her in their pristine stone. A glass shed still seemed to twinkle in the soft drizzle.  A small field divided the buildings and her. To the north of the field was a lake with what looked like black swans and ducks. “I guess Google came in clutch when I asked for an ‘aesthetic’ library.” She breathed out. Turning off her car, she took account of all the items she would need before walking out. Pulling her backpack straps tighter onto her shoulders, she slipped her phone into her back pocket.

 

As she walked toward the path that led through what looked like a small village. Her shoes making contact with the cobblestone felt odd as she continued forward. The path turned from stone to gravel, and she couldn’t help but notice the stone animals everywhere. Sheep, goats, frogs, and miniature lions littered across the area. A decent-sized built-in creek washed across river rocks (or at least she hoped it was built in), and there had not been any clear indicators of a river nearby on the maps. It was beautiful and eerie all the same.

 

She pulled out her phone and snapped a few pictures to send to her brother and her friends. Captioning it “Pretty right?”. As she walked closer, the library came into view. It looked like it was a castle of sorts. With a looming white structure attached to the back of it. Must be a later addition, she thought. The main building had brick with ornate wooden trimmings along the windows, towers at both ends, with staircases you could see from the outside. She walked up to the doors. Double doors with brass ornate knobs. Pained windows, some with stained glass atop their arches. Placing her hand on the knob to walk in she noted how heavy the doors actually felt. She nearly had to put her full body weight into it.",1,1753229435.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

When I first started teaching Italian, I remember one student who was puzzled by the verbs *prendere* and *portare*. ""Why can't I just use one for everything?"" they asked, scratching their head. Well, these verbs are like the yin and yang of Italian, each with its own flavor and purpose.

**Understanding *portare***

*Portare* is your go-to verb when you're **bringing** something to a **destination**. Picture this: You're heading to Grandma's house with a bouquet of flowers. In Italian, you'd say, ""Posso *portare* i fiori alla nonna?"" It's all about the journey towards a place. 

But wait, there's more! *Portare* can also mean:
- **To wear**: ""Lei *porta* sempre gli occhiali."" (She always wears glasses.)
- **To lead**: ""Questo lavoro *porta* molte soddisfazioni."" (This job brings a lot of satisfaction.)

**Decoding *prendere***

On the flip side, *prendere* is all about **taking** or **grabbing**. Imagine you're at the florist, picking up those flowers. You'd say, ""Vado a *prendere* i fiori dal fioraio."" It's about the action of acquiring, not where you're headed next.

*Prendere* also shines in expressions like:
- **To order food**: ""Prendo un caffè, grazie."" (I'll have a coffee, thanks.)
- **To catch transport**: ""Prendiamo un taxi."" (Let's take a taxi.)

**Join the conversation!**

Do these verbs twist your tongue, too? Share your experiences with *prendere* and *portare* in the comments. Let's swap stories and maybe have a laugh or two. After all, learning a language is not just about rules—it's about the journey, right?

# Character One: Beginning of SP-01

Glorsku General:

Comrades and comrades!

I stand here before you as the commander of the Portal Star project, established right here in liberated Glorsku - in a country that only a few months ago was bleeding under the boot of Nazi oppression.

This place, where we now gather, was recently shaken by artillery fire during the Prague offensive. Well today - today we are here as free people. Not as victors over one regime, but as pioneers of a new era, an era of revolutionary science and socialist progress.

If the Nazi command had claimed authority over Lieutenant Białyslaw Pańtwosky, make no doubt about it - their Gestapo would have dragged Captains GG-02 and GG-03 into my command room. And in the worst case - it also executed them. But our men would face death without hesitation - because we are revolutionaries, not slaves!

Today we face a new threat. Not with a swastika, but with a dark force from beyond the stars.

Bram's weapon—that diabolical machine that creates portal passages between worlds—is a tool that can fall into the wrong hands. But know that an electromagnetic pulse, properly directed, can stop its entire course. Just as one single person can stand in the way of evil.

We have to learn from it. Comrades! We can resist. Not just alien invaders. Not just imperialist capitalism. But also despair, betrayal, indifference! And if we meet fascists, Americans, or capitalists in need - we will help them. Not because of them, but because of humanity itself. Because a true revolutionary knows that a person is more than an ideology.

Revolution does not spread by force, comrades. We don't need tanks to spread the truth. Our enemies - not excluding the Americans - may tempt the world, but they do not offer it a soul.

We are not fighting for conquest! We fear for the future! We are fighting for a revolution. For socialism. For the stars.

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!

We fight for REVOLUTION AND SOCIALISM!!!

1951, a calm sky stretches overhead, with large clouds drifting swiftly across the sunlit day above a military base. And, Autumn forest turns from green to yellow like a lime color. Around its perimeter, protesters begin to gather. The bunker door starts to seal shut, guarded firmly by the entire army standing its ground. In the air—tense peace.

The protesters wave old Glorsku flags and chant slogans from before the Communist coup. Some shout for freedom. Others cry for bread.

Suddenly, the gate explodes. The crowd surges forward. Protesters breach the base.

“They're anti-communist.”

“Like fascist or capitalist?”

“No. The resistance movement is crucial for keeping our nation united—not to ignite a civil war between Czechs and Slovaks, nor to stage some revolutionary overthrow. We need to stop waging wars with other nations. We should be learning from the mistakes of the Interwar period.”

“They will come down under a united cause. And no—killing in its name will only end in bloodshed…”

“General, you need help—tanks, planes, something.”

“No. We don’t need a counterrevolution on our soil. Wait—who am I talking to? How old are you?”

“I am General Prahasko of the socialist underground. And now, Major General of the Homeland Army.

“I envy your title. Yet, I have a more important job than you.”

“What’s your post? Where do you operate?”

""Ask Boris, Head of the KGB. But understand this—if any civilian is killed on my bases, I’ll personally have him send *you* to Siberia. And if your men do such a thing under your command, I’ll kill you myself—by his own doctrine, as if I held the KGB chair. Protesters turned into rioters, echoing the Glorsku uprising—speaking again from the tense scenes of May 9th, 1954. But this isn’t May—it’s September 1st, 1955. This is for the government to resolve, not us. In May, it was the army’s task. September belongs to the politicians. But we are general, dummy.""

A few days in the future, “Tanya! We need you for the project. We’ll protect you—for the sake of your family’s future. I understand how much your family meant to you… how your mother’s birth was like the right hand of your core. You’re my aunt, Tanya. Not by blood alone, but by the oath of loyalty that binds us.”

“Erich Ivanov Serebryakov-Kozzacko... You are Rusyn, born of your mother’s homeland—the same homeland that gave me her loyalty with unwavering honor. If you carry her blood, then you carry the same flame I once thought had died with her.”

General Serebryakov-Kozzacko giving her favorite composer from relaxation being ready for her interview of her life in details, top secret information from her last life with non-favor light level of Rohypnol-Benzodiazepines plus high level of Ketamine beer for deep truth of her life. Then drinking drugged water with a light drink headed and slowed speech, generally showing the doctor to come here. “How long will its effects last?”

“It lasted around 11-26 hours for our interview and lasted 12-37 min, the beer effect would be stronger. She drank/ took this before?”

“Yes, I remember she experimented with my mother about drugs plus she was drinking at parties like hers and my mother’s birthday.”

12 minutes later, “I was a Japanese salaryman who was hit by a train by my canceling on man's future with a logical mindset. From my personality as cold-hearted, atheistic, and[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism)social- darwinism atheism by a past that I want to forget.

She keeps talking about it. 11 hours later: “OK. I understand this about your past life, I want to know about this lifetime.”

“Doctor, 11 hours have gone by. She needs to take more?”

“No, she doesn't need to but she has 14 hours more to go away. I need to take Morphine from this to be successful. You can sleep in this interview and I will take it for medical reasons.”

Author’s words: This will be a summary of the interview for the future plots, this information will show about other volumes for you as a reader. Her words are similar to talking to the camera within a Live TV Show like hell’s kitchen.

""My new life in the Empire is one marked by conflict, and from the very beginning, I demonstrate a pragmatic, military-minded intelligence. My military career begins with my rapid rise through the ranks due to my remarkable talent for combat magic and tactical warfare. Despite being physically a child, my mind is that of a seasoned adult, focused on survival and strategic success. I am particularly known for my calculated, ruthless approach to war, gaining me the nickname The Devil of the Rhine.""

""I am not simply a war machine—I am also a victim of Being X’s divine intervention. My primary personal goal becomes escaping the hold of the divine entity that placed me into this world, as I believe that I am being punished for my previous life’s atheism. Being X frequently appears to me as an elusive, god-like force, constantly interfering with my fate, leading to my internal struggle between my atheism and the undeniable existence of a higher power that controls my life.""

""My military tactics are brilliant, but they are also deeply pragmatic and often morally ambiguous. As an officer, I am deeply ruthless in my actions, using my magic and strategic intellect to crush my enemies without hesitation. I am quick to exploit weaknesses in my adversaries and, often, my subordinates as well. My cold pragmatism allows me to survive in a brutal, war-torn world where alliances are temporary, and lives are expendable.""

""My subordinates, such as the members of my elite unit—especially my loyal subordinate, Viktoriya Ivanovna Serebryakov—often find themselves caught between loyalty to me and the sheer terror of my cold, emotionless nature. My leadership style is often marked by my ability to outmaneuver my opponents tactically, exploiting weaknesses and leveraging the power of magic to ensure my dominance on the battlefield. My ascent through the military hierarchy is both a testament to my intelligence and my willingness to do whatever it takes to ensure my survival.""

""The central conflict of my life is my struggle against Being X, who not only controls my fate but also serves as the embodiment of divine providence. I, an atheistic character, loathe this entity and view it as the embodiment of everything I despise: an arbitrary higher power that imposes a predetermined fate upon me. In my previous life, I was a strong believer in self-determination and individual agency, rejecting any notion of divine intervention or guidance.""

""As I rise in military rank, Being X continues to intervene in my life in an attempt to guide me toward a religious awakening or to prove the existence of divine providence. This constant interference from Being X frustrates me, pushing me to confront a series of existential dilemmas. I become increasingly focused on finding a way to escape the divine’s influence, believing that my survival, success, and eventual escape from the god’s manipulation are the ultimate tests of my power and intelligence.""

""My antagonism toward Being X becomes a defining characteristic of my journey, and my attempts to find meaning in a world dominated by war, manipulation, and divine control are central to the storyline. This philosophical battle between my atheism and Being X’s divine machinations becomes one of the core themes of my existence.""

""My worldview is shaped by my experiences in the military. In this world, the Empire and its neighboring nations are embroiled in a brutal, unending war, with alliances shifting as quickly as military strategies. Magic is a powerful tool of warfare, and military leaders are expected to be both powerful mages and skilled tacticians. My leadership and magical abilities make me one of the Empire’s most feared officers, though I am also deeply aware of the human cost of warfare.""

""My pragmatic approach to the violence around me is rooted in the philosophy of survival and the will to power. I subscribe to a form of social Darwinism, believing that only the strong survive and that the weak must be discarded in the face of conflict. While I do not lack a sense of loyalty or responsibility to my comrades, my moral compass is twisted by the harsh realities of the world I inhabit, where survival often comes at the expense of others.""

""Despite my ruthless actions, there are moments where my humanity surfaces. I experience guilt, pain, and doubt, especially when confronted with the futility of the wars I fight or the personal losses I endure. These moments of vulnerability complicate my otherwise cold and calculating persona, highlighting the internal conflict that defines much of my character.""

""My ultimate goal is to escape the clutches of Being X and, in doing so, free myself from the divine interference in my life. Throughout my journey, I am consistently trying to outsmart the divine, using my intellect, military genius, and magic to out-maneuver Being X’s plans. This goal defines much of my character arc and drives my actions in both military engagements and personal decisions.""

""My relationship with my subordinates evolves as well. While I initially treat them as mere tools in my ascent through the ranks, I come to recognize their value and loyalty. My bond with them, particularly with Viktoriya and my other subordinates, is complex—I am both their leader and a person they look to for guidance, but at the same time, my methods often challenge their moral boundaries.""

""As my power grows, so too does the reach of Being X’s influence. The military conflicts I engage in become more complex and catastrophic, and my tactics are both admired and feared by all who witness them. However, as I approach the peak of my military career, my existential struggle with Being X comes to a head. I am faced with a final confrontation that will determine whether I can free myself from the divine's influence and prove that I can control my own fate.""

""The overarching plot of my life touches upon themes of free will versus divine fate, the morality of warfare, the corrupting nature of power, and the philosophical battle between belief and atheism. Throughout my journey, my character evolves from a purely pragmatic military leader to a person grappling with questions of identity, faith, and personal redemption.""

14 hours later: “Erich, what happened in this interview.”

“This interview was 26 hours long, while you had these questions, that you black out. While answering all questions is similar to driving blindness, aunt said that we need to sleep because we need water from too much alcohol that we had without knowing about it. The doctor told me to go on for our interview by pushing sub-conscious.”

Next day, “Aunt , drugging you for my knowledge of you. I know, my mother had this information for you, please don’t be pissed.”

“Erich, I don't do that much. I became friends with Being X, he told me in my dream. It is a secret from everything, I need to think about being X is actually my father from my past life. I can tell you and others about it, resetting them is the mother's secret to the whole family. I need to keep until I die like a full reset like a breaker, you know me more deeper then your mother for my sake.”

**Tanya von Degurechaf Courtroom From A Year Ago:**

A long, dark corridor lit by flickering sodium lamps. The air is damp with mildew and memory. Boots echo across concrete like distant gunfire. Tanya von Degurechaff enters, her posture soldier-straight, but her eyes… hollow. She wears a plain olive-gray coat, stripped of medals and insignia—like a ghost dressed in the shadow of her former self. Faces watch from both sides— soldiers, partisans, tribunal staff. Some in awe. Others in disgust. One old woman spits. At the front sits the panel: A Glorsku general, a Soviet commissar, a Jewish survivor in a modest shawl, and an American observer with a tape recorder. But the central voice is General Prahasko, the scar-faced veteran known for breaking war criminals with only questions.

“Tanya von Degurechaff. Former Commander, Imperial Mage Division. Known aliases: The Devil of the Rhine. Annihilation Angel. Secondhand Godchild. Accused of 21,500 confirmed civilian killings in the First War; indirect responsibility for around 80 million deportations and 4,356 extermination campaigns during the Second. Further accusations: psychological manipulation of child soldiers, deployment of unauthorized weapons upon surrendering forces, and—”

“Stop. Stop now!!! I can hear it any more being I am saying please, forgive me please.”

She picks up a charred photograph from the mountain of documents. A burned village. A dying child’s eyes stare straight at her—captured forever. With her tears like depressed person going do suicide.

“I... remember this one. That day... It was raining ash... I ordered it. I am like Hitler and Stalin in one person but I am the deadliest leader in the world. Fuck me, I was so evil more then worst one in my earth’s history.”

No denial. No apology. No attempt to shift blame. Just a broken soul standing naked before truth. Tanya pulls the files toward her—hands trembling, eyes hollow. And she begins to read aloud, each name, each location, each act. A ritual. A funeral. A courtroom exorcism. Tears stream silently. Each page a bullet into her own mythology.

“The Party has decided not to execute you. Instead—your name, your rank, your identity... will be erased. For the crimes of Tanya von Degurechaff, there will be no legacy. Only shame.”

She slowly removes her overcoat and places it on the cold stone floor. A final act of surrender.

“Then let her die here. With Suicidal mindset. Ashes of the Homeland for a new revolution is not just the overthrow of systems, but the honest facing of memory, guilt, and soul.”

She picks up the new registry document, signs it: Tanya walks alone through white ash and snow, her breath visible. Old barracks collapse in the wind behind her like memories crumbling. Children laugh in the distance, their voices bright but far. She stops. Watches. One tear rolls down her cheek—not for herself, but for the life she burned.

“Why, being X...? Why give me this life again? Perhaps… one soul can still be rebuilt.”

She looks to the pale winter sky. That stopped her depressive mindset and by wanting to start a new life of peace.

**Tanya’s Dream:**

In the heart of a fractured world, where memory and time collide in fractured symphonies, Tanya finds herself on an endless train, racing through endless landscapes of history’s ghosts—wars, revolutions, empires rising and falling in moments, scattered and lost. She sits there, staring out the window, seeing not the road ahead but the smoldering ruins of places she's never been, yet somehow knows deeply, intimately. The train doesn’t stop, but the scenery shifts, constantly changing from one chapter of her life to the next—flashes of victories long forgotten, failures she can't remember, and desires that were never her own. It all merges, a kaleidoscope of past and future worlds, and Tanya is a spectator, but also the director.

Her feet don’t feel the train beneath her—they feel the endless weight of the generations she carries on her shoulders. She tries to step off, but the floor beneath her dissolves, and she is transported into a courtroom, or perhaps a battlefield dressed as a courtroom. A figure sits at the front—her own face, twisted in judgment. She is both accused and accuser, and the crime is too vast to name. She opens her mouth to speak, to explain, to protest, but all that escapes her lips are screams—dissonant, tangled in a reel of static and memories too painful to untangle. The jury is made of faces she recognizes but can't place—those she has loved, and those she has betrayed. They do not speak. No one speaks. The verdict is not theirs to give. Time itself stands still, a frozen weight pressing on her chest.

She’s thrust from this space, as if pulled by invisible hands, and suddenly, she is in an office—an office she never worked in, yet somehow, it’s hers. Papers cover the desk, blank, unreadable, like the future before her. The walls, devoid of pictures, are shifting, constantly rearranging themselves. The air hums with the sound of decisions she hasn’t made, lives she hasn’t lived, promises broken before they could be kept. In the corner of the room stands Viktoriya, a quiet figure, still, hands holding a cup of coffee that never cools. She stares at Tanya with eyes that hold both sympathy and reproach, asking softly, almost as if she already knows the answer: “Will you start over?”

Tanya opens her mouth, but before she can respond, the world itself bends around her. The walls crack, splintering into fragments that rain down like snowflakes, falling into an abyss of water. She doesn’t drown, but she sinks—deeper, deeper, into a cold, silent ocean of her own making. Down below, she sees something. A figure, small, fragile, yet unbroken, stands on the ocean floor. It is herself, only younger—barefoot, untarnished by the wars she fought, unscarred by the lessons she learned too late. This younger version of Tanya looks at her with soft eyes, not full of judgment or pity, but a quiet, painful understanding. The child speaks in a voice that isn’t really a voice, but a pull at her heart: “Remember... and choose.”

And then everything stops. The water stills, the office vanishes, the train ceases its endless motion. Tanya wakes—but she is not where she was. She is not who she was. She is something *new*, something *other*, yet still herself in ways she cannot yet understand. The train, the endless ride, is still there, but now, it no longer holds her captive. She is not rushing to somewhere she must be, nor is she chasing something that no longer matters. She sits, still, and looks out at the passing world with eyes that have finally seen it for what it truly is—fragile, broken, yet beautiful. And for the first time in ages, she doesn't feel the weight of history bearing down on her, nor the responsibility of wars not her own. She feels free.

In this final moment of clarity, she understands that the dream is not hers to conclude. It holds no end, no final destination. It is simply a journey—an endless series of steps she must choose to take, day by day, moment by moment, unburdened by a past that doesn’t belong to her, or a future she cannot control. In the space between what is and what could be, she chooses—not to flee, but to live, to forgive, to remember. To start anew. Even as empires fall and new banners rise, even as Tanya von Degurechaff becomes Tanya Gurečafska, no new name can erase the past. No revolution can erase the memories of the soul. I know I am broken inside, but I will heal from this.

**Her Bedroom:**

Tanya awakens, drenched in cold sweat, her hands trembling as the remnants of her dream linger in the stillness of the room. The nightmare, a shattered mosaic of past and future, leaves her shaken, as though she's been dragged across time itself by forces she cannot name or escape. The weight of her past decisions presses heavily on her chest, suffocating, relentless. She stands there, facing the mirror in her quiet bedroom, staring at her reflection. The woman in the glass is no longer just Tanya von Degurechaff; she is a soul fractured by endless wars, hollow victories, and a future that stretches out, as boundless and empty as the train she was trapped on in her dream.

In this moment of painful clarity, she feels something unfamiliar stir within her—a voice, perhaps her own, perhaps something more, urging her to remember. To choose. To start anew. The young girl she saw beneath the ocean’s depths, untouched by the world’s burdens, gazes at her with quiet understanding. ""Remember... and choose."" A pull at her heart, as though this decision is the key to breaking free from the never-ending cycle of destruction.

Tanya’s gaze shifts from the mirror, where her reflection begins to morph into the figure of her past life as a Japanese salaryman—silent, composed, holding a cup of coffee. Her presence is both soothing and accusatory. ""Will you start over?"" The question lingers in the air, an undeniable challenge. For a brief moment, Tanya freezes, not from fear, but from the weight of what such a choice means. The walls around her crack, shattering like the illusions she has carefully constructed. She sinks—not into despair, but into something deeper, something unspoken, a quiet catharsis.

Tears fall—unexpected, soft, but necessary. For the first time, she does not flee. She does not run from the past, nor from the future. She simply chooses—to live, to forgive, to remember. Not to escape, but to begin again, as if every moment, every decision, is hers to shape. And in that fragile, fleeting moment of clarity, Tanya feels free—free from the past, free from the train, free from the wars that once defined her existence. She is still herself, but a new version. The journey is far from over, and perhaps it never will be, but now, she is no longer a prisoner. She is the one who will choose the next step, even in the face of all that still needs healing.

*Erich didn’t approach me seeking mercy; he approached out of necessity. The world they lived in—fragile, shattered—was on the edge of another catastrophe. New powers were rising from the wreckage of old wars, much like my own world in the 20th century. They needed my tactical brilliance, her understanding of war on a scale no other soul could comprehend.*

""I believed in logic alone. In this life, I believed only in survival. In the next… perhaps I will learn to believe in souls. The higher I rise, the deeper the scars I leave, both on the world and on myself.""

*I eventually come to realize that no victory, no accumulation of power, no clever evasion of Being X’s plans can erase the weight of what I’ve done. The blood of the Rhine, the ashes of the villages, the broken gazes of children—they never wash away, no matter how far I run, or how high I climb.*

""This is so annoying about buying DVDs, always the cash grab! I hate how they do this every time a series ends!"" he says. He turns to his mom and says, ""Mom, you’re crying because I’m crying."" *My mom is the most sensitive in the family, unlike my dad, who’s the complete opposite—he came from a military family, just like my grandpa, who fought in the Pacific during WWII.*

""No, I’m not crying. I’m just cutting onions for dinner. Son, you’re too impulsive for your own name,"" she replies.

Hey, I am the narrator here. For non-Japanese speakers, \[まんさらり\]\[服サラリーマンの\] reads as *Mansarari Fukusaraimanu*. His name roughly means ""Mansarari’s Clothes for Businessmen."" I’m so happy about this flashback—it brings back the nostalgia of my childhood in NYC. I’m sharing this from my memory, back when DVDs and TV were annoyingly always pushing you to buy DVDs or CDs. But looking back, it was simple—nothing like today’s chaos with social media.

Few weeks after his isekaization, line to the door with everyone that he knew plus people in the train station.

|| || |**Father’s Suicide Letter:** **Dear My Lovely Wife:** If you are reading this, it means I could no longer carry the weight. I’m sorry—I’m so deeply sorry for the pain this may cause you, though I fear my absence will only echo the emptiness that has already begun to take root. Our son is gone. I can’t believe I’m writing those words. I can’t breathe knowing they are true. The light of my life, the boy I held in my arms, taught to walk, taught to speak, and dreamed with—he's gone. And no reason, no explanation, no justice can ever make that right. I tried to be strong for you. For him. But the silence left in his absence is louder than any scream. And when the truth arrived—too late, too sharp—it broke something in me that cannot be repaired. He died, and the world kept turning like nothing had happened. That’s the part I can't live with. What kind of father am I if I can’t protect my son? What kind of man survives while his child is buried beneath questions and grief? Please forgive me. This is not your fault. It’s not even mine alone. It is the fault of a world that waited too long, and a justice system that counts days while we count pieces of our hearts. I cannot endure this timeline any longer. I am coming for him like helping in my next life. Forever yours, Your Beloved Husband| || || ||

**Chapter Two: Journey Begins**

We come back to this reality, a term called SP-01 coming out from some desert that they thought of as Sahara. “Wow, it is successful. Later I thought, GG-01 and GG-02 need to ride on Pionir with me opposite the way of sunset because you know from geology. You need to learn Francois because you know our enemy language (from our occupation by Nazis) for your own good, GG-03 and GG-04 staying next to the portal for sending messages to we made it plus protecting the gateway. Let’s go, we need to come back to our base for making plans then giving it to our government not only saving our comrades.”

A few days later, “where is the other side of the port city called Nouadhibou and New Nouad- hibou is a town that gives a faster path for us by ferry, not ships like in that city.”

“Hey, you sound like autistic. You've been in here before?” Everyone is laughing while the truck is shaking like an earthquake.

“Of course, it was my visit to Henri Joseph Goumenri. He is like us for socialism and anti-imperial, I love his work like Erich will talk about because I want to know you more than you know me like you are doing now. Well we still need to go to New Nouadhibou, you need to go for other topics. Sorry, for that our discussion from my past. Similar question about Greece, like you talked about a girl that you have a crush on?”

“No, no. She isn’t like that for me,” why’ll blush at the same time.

“You know you are cute, when you are blushing. Look at Horizon, New Nouadhibou is close. We will be around an hour, that good that we are not living in the Firefly universe. New Nouadhibou is his hometown, he has few kids that you like spending time with. Someone is attacking the town and city, Nazi pirates. No, it is not them. Resistance freighter, you need to be ready to fight like in Stalingrad. We can fly well because I was banned from flying, they have it. Fuck, I’ll be using it from them. Now, go faster.”

They are shocked about Resistance frights coming from flying overhead on a beetle, “they don’t have armor like they have stolen the tech. We need to fight with French forces for our safety, you need to say to them that we are Glorsku army in exile.”

“Pirate Raid Sirens combined all of Hörmann and Siemens sirens into ones called Sirènes d'occupation system and Siemens one is louder for telling what it is air for example, he is training your skills against resistance like under our nation will have.” They are riding to the town with a non-propaganda song to hide their identity, “Goumenri don’t know about our identity. He will understand about it, better to change the topic about how we are opposites for our own good.”

An hour later, the town is in ruin from the pirate's defensive raid system screaming out like a crying baby from top of the lungs while going into the city. People doing their things then people are punching, they are running into shelters like cattle herds going into processing facilities from the deadliest shot called bunker busters bullet. “Turyści odchodzą od ogona i budynku, do magazynu, a ty możesz popatrzeć na prasę.” - Their misunderstanding from a Pospolita tour guide into their language. “Turisté jdou na chvostu budovám, ke skladování a mohou být staré u tisku.”- what the tour guide actually said.

Children are playing around with their bikes and scooters within bomb craters, “going to the shelter and meeting up with their parents… What up, my old friend and come to bomb shelter with me. I like to talk about our life going on, I heard an Empire dictator looks similar to you.”

“Hey, Tanya! How are you, my old friend.”

“This is Goumenri?” 

“Yes, he is. He will help with our issues, if you ask anything that he will do.”

“I will fight for your city because we are the Free Glorsku Corps of the International Occup- ational Army. I know you need time with Tanya for old pals to do.” 

“Do you know that the Cold War is between National Liberal and Social Liberal from outcry from National Socialism (White Army and Weimarium), I predict the West will be an unholy social liberal like in 1930s-40s.”

“Did you hear about Nazical Watch Trials from members of the Imperiale Weibliche Völkisch Prinzip Ordnungs Partei (Imperial People of Girlhood Order Principle Party)? That truth about your prediction with my own will be like your mindset, the pact of nations will be going opposite paths like we are seeing now in our modern world that people are aware of it. I will teach you about the power of wisdom from scientific magic, I was the master of your general and Tanya came to me to relearn wisdom from god but she didn’t learn from him.”

“O Arabisch Kossacki w pospolity noci a nich, poza Łado senu: O arabských Kozákoch v pospolity noci a ich útoku, póza Lado nespal. Dwaji Dwaji, Ludzisk Pospolitacy od Rzeczpospolita: Dvaji dvaji, obyčejní lidé z Rzeczpospolita.”

They all going into shelter but they don’t know those tourist are spies of Peoples Rzeczpospolita, Rzeczpospolian can speaking Rusynian language put within Sokolia/ Góralska/ Rzeczpos- polita for international language is dialectics per language (this is like paradox from coming from dying language, they don’t know it is there god is dead but other god took over dying world like “The Boy and The Horn” can be called beauty of death by giving alway to other generation).

Top Secret discussion for you, you need to give me — a card for the classified document but you are spying on them under gods eye. If you are an angel that you can go for free, if not you can’t know our secret from Top Earth’s Secret (from your freedom to create dialog).

Kids are playing an artifact that looks like Pokémon ball, “Hey Kids. What type of toy do you have?” The kids that Tanya is talking to, he is confused and afraid that you were a kid that you felt defensive to your toy that you think some will take away from you. “It looks like an artifact not a toy, it looks like a pokémon ball. Where did you find that? I don’t mind you keeping it because finder keepers, I need to take over that pokémon ball factory.”

“What is a Pokémon ball? Pokémon ball, a toy or something else like a grenade?""

“Hey Kid, throw it in the corner with your mother standing next to you to protect you from us.” Then that kid throws the pokémon ball, there is a type of Pokémon.

“Wait. what? That is a Gadmeer or Mewtwo! Mewtwo (from Pokémon) made Gadmeer (Stargate) into their civilizational empire/-s, Mewtwo escaped into Stargate’s Universe by Quantum Window becoming Gadmeer from finding a time machine in their views?”

“Hello, my race is Gadmeer Beta Alius from the pokémon genus called Mewtwo.”

“Ok, you proved my theory about Pokémon's Universe Quantum Windowed Stargate.”

“I want to be your Pokémon because you know my kind and stargate so why’ll.”

“In this reality that we have music and gate guns, Stargate is called Starportal in this reality. I will call you from Taban-bę (Nepanese language of datebase), do you love that? Pokémon can’t exist in this world, what is your main culture?” Nepan is Japan in this reality not Nepal, XP.

“I don’t mind, it may fit you more than my own title. My race is that we are using a Pokémon ball coming from Mewtwo world as an original world like Pokémon ball factories in abandoned islands, it was nuked around a few nuclear bombs per island.” The Pokémon world looks like a type of utopia that comes from the eyes of a kid but the reality is darker or even darker then our timeline/ world like his pre-isekaizian Earth history, “I want to say something and ask a ques- tion. What is your name? How is the quantum window different from the quantum mirror?”

“My name is only cats and pokémon understands, humans need to name us like pets and that is shameful. I want to see your most popular cities and landmarks on Earth, like you have in Roo- sevelt Island Civic Center, New York, New Yorkshire, New England?”

“Yes, we expect that it isn't called New York, New Yorkshire but Yankeeham, Yankeeshire in Angloland and we have Roosevelt-Randall-Ricker-Governor Island Civic Center for the SEM-P system like other nations have there to better control over the nation with Dingecommunism/ Resgemeinsamism from Rzeczpospolitism within Rzeszpospolitism. Kościuszko become frist president of Angloland and he pushed Resgemeinsamism is nationalist with his moment are socialist scheme that they pushing for Dingecommunism, Angloland Civil War had two main problem is Slavery from greedic elites from the Southern part of Angloland but North don’t want it anymore plus Angloland Eastern-Western divided was made people wanting to for Empire are Resgemeinsamism (Polish Philosopher want to make Poland into being like Roman Empire from the word called Rzeszpospolitism) against it could called Dingecommunism (Polish Philosopher want to make Poland into become like family from the word called Rzeczpospolitism).""",2,1753228518.0,YoujoSenki,0,0.75,False

1m6u5iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m6u5iz/is_a_helicopter_tour_in_oahu_worth_it/,Is a helicopter tour in Oahu worth it?,"Just got back from an incredible helicopter tour in Oahu, and I wanted to share my honest thoughts since I see this question pop up a lot.

After exploring Oahu both by land and air, I can confidently say that seeing the island from above gives you a completely different perspective. While helicopter tours aren't cheap (ranging from $300-500 per person), the aerial views of places like the North Shore, Diamond Head, and Pearl Harbor are absolutely breathtaking.

But here's the thing - while helicopter tours are amazing, I actually found that combining aerial views with ground exploration gives you the best overall experience. That's why I highly recommend starting with a comprehensive circle island tour first. It helps you get oriented and understand the layout of Oahu before seeing it from above.

Speaking of circle island tours, I recently did one with Go Tours Hawaii that was exceptional. For $154, you get to see all the major landmarks including the Waimea Waterfall (where you can actually swim!), North Shore beaches, and even secret spots most tourists miss. Our guide shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture and history that you just can't get from a helicopter view.

You can check out the tour details and book here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

The best part? The tour includes stops at places like the Halona Blowhole, Nu'uanu Pali Lookout, and Kualoa Ranch (where they filmed Jurassic Park). Plus, you get to taste local Kona coffee and macadamia nuts - something you definitely can't do from a helicopter!

From my experience, if your budget allows, do both. Start with the circle island tour to get intimate with the island, then splurge on a helicopter ride later in your trip. That way, when you're up in the air, you'll actually recognize the landmarks below and have a deeper appreciation for what you're seeing.

But if you have to choose just one, I'd honestly recommend the circle island tour first. It's more budget-friendly, gives you more hands-on experiences, and lets you actually interact with the places you're visiting rather than just seeing them from above.

Plus, the circle island tour I mentioned includes hotel pickup, a local guide, and all entrance fees - pretty good value considering how much ground you cover in 8 hours. You can always save the helicopter tour for your next visit to Oahu.

Bottom line: Helicopter tours are amazing but not essential for experiencing Oahu's beauty. A comprehensive ground tour gives you more bang for your buck and a more intimate island experience.

1m6u5he,https://www.reddit.com/r/redflagsTA/comments/1m6u5he/how_bad_is_it_this_time/,How bad is it this time?,"Quick background and dynamic...I (26F) am currently into a 7 month relationship with a (28M). We regularly call ea other 4 times a day but never have anything to say but pleasantries. We've never argued but I've brought up my feelings quite often. He's usually quiet and regularly shuts his mind off, I'm starting to wonder if he's learnt it from childhood. I'm more needy than he can provide for sure... the only (rare) times he'd completely open up emotionally and physically is when he's partially asleep or drunk, everything turns extremely sweet and loving.

In the first few 2-3 months there was absolutely nothing except for the daily calls. He would see me only once a week in the morning for coffee but even then he was lost in his head. I couldn't touch him, get close to him,  nor make any kind of conversation. I've practically begged for a response and ended up using pitiful means to find attention in which case I was told not to be ""like that"" with zero context. Every time I brought up my feelings it would be passed off as a joke and he'd move on from it. 

It slowly changed when I asked him if I was a placeholder for until he was happy during one of our conversations and I think something might have clicked for him when I said that. Since then on he put more effort in starting conversations and stopped pushing time away with me. Listened to me, didn't treat my emotions as a joke anymore. Lunch dates, longer calls, bi-weekly cuddle sessions. We've brought up the idea of moving in together. I'm happier with this direction, but I'm still a little lonely, and honestly, maybe hold some resentment after typing this all out. 

He's never opened up to me about his past, completely avoids personal questions like the plague, took 6 months before he introduced me to his family through a wedding invite (and up to then me and my mom believed he was secretly married, BUT I did meet his cousin before then)

I've already gone at least three times broken hearted fully convinced I was going to break it off with him till we'd have a conversation about what hurt me and we'd backtrack to fix things. He tends to be a little forceful/demanding about things like when he wants me to sit down or walk on the edge of the road bc it makes him peeved when I walk on it (no sidewalk, no cars)... seemingly upset whenever it's something he considers embarrassing I guess? I haven't brought that concern up yet. I want to make this work but I tend to wear a blind fold when it comes to relationships. Is this what a proper relationship looks like?

1m6u4w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1m6u4w8/do_you_like_acai_bowls/,Do you like Acai Bowls?,">*Açai bowls are a sweet Brazilian snack food from Pará and Amazonas. It is a dish made with the frozen and mashed fruit of the açaí palm, described as having an ""earthy"" or creamy taste. Its texture is granular before blending and it has a tartness from its acidity, creating a favorable taste. It is served as a smoothie in a bowl, sometimes mixed with guaraná syrup or other sweeteners, and is commonly topped with granola and banana.*

Acai bowl places keep popping up in my town. I've never tried them and it seems like those shops close down within a few seasons of opening. 

* Do you like Açai Bowls? 
* Do you know people who do?

I'm wondering what's driving these places to open. One that just opened recently is masquerading as a coffee shop but half their menu is Açai and another opened in an out of the way location that has had 4 shops successively fail. 

* Are these hobby-businesses? 

I don't even live near Boston. Like people where I live don't even know how to pronounce ah-say-ay-ee bowls. It's like that ramen shop that opened up nearby and charges $17 for a bowl of Japanese chicken noodle soup and is never busy.

Went to the doctors and they blew it off as stress as all my labs were normal. About a month later my urine just decreased like overnight. Went to a new PCP and she ran many blood tests and I had H. Pylori. Did quad treatment. A month later I had a GI appointment set up and a colonoscopy and endoscopy shortly after. There was inflammation in my ileum and I have metaplasia throughout my stomach from autoimmune atrophic gastritis (verified with blood and biopsy). Symptoms still linger to this day I’ve had CT scans, MRI-E and ultrasounds of my urinary tract and thyroid. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s though I don’t present much of the normal symptoms other than fatigue and occasional cramping. My mystery is the urination. It’s gotten slightly better since then but not lining up with how much water I drink. I wake up in the morning  and don’t have a crazy urge to go like I used to. Could anyone point me in the right direction? It’s very worrisome and it’s consumed my life monitoring how much I pee. Any help would be appreciated!

I'm seeking representation for my novel, *FURTHER, STILL*, a work of upmarket literary fiction about confronting burnout, guilt, and the cost of duty on a 500-mile pilgrimage across Spain. Complete at 93,000 words, it will appeal to readers drawn to the emotional complexity of Miranda Cowley Heller's *The Paper Palace* and the grief-steeped journey in Charlotte McConaghy's *Migrations.*

A Catholic pilgrimage an ocean away is an unlikely choice for a nonreligious workaholic like Sylvia, but the creased, stolen photo of a lone hiker somewhere on the trail holds a secret that won’t let her go. She’s determined to unravel its mystery, even if it means walking the entire Camino de Santiago. Crossing steep mountains, rain-soaked forests, and wind-scoured plains, the Camino offers no respite from the panic attacks that have plagued her since the pandemic. Every cobblestone step through crumbling monasteries and ancient villages brings blistering pain and, worse, unearths what she tried to leave behind: a childhood in a cult, the unraveling of her public health career at the peak of the crisis, and the recent traumatic death of her best friend—whose presence shadows every mile.

On the trail, she’s drawn into a ragtag group of fellow pilgrims: a condescending cowboy with a secret soft side, a relentlessly cheerful Australian, and Karl, a brooding yet magnetic Englishman whose past mirrors her own. With them, moments of joy break through: a raucous night at a medieval festival, a golden afternoon of wine and swimming, and quiet conversations that steady her mid-panic. Slowly, the rhythm of the trail cracks Sylvia's over-analytical, withdrawn exterior.

But a devastating confession from Karl forces her to confront the belief she’s tried to bury: that she could have stopped her friend’s death—and didn’t. With her body breaking down from the trail's grueling demands and the panic closing in, Sylvia must finally face the truth—or risk becoming a ghost the Camino couldn’t save.

*FURTHER, STILL* weaves the voice of the Camino and the Greek myth of Helios and Phaethon into an exploration of trauma recovery, the quiet work of redemption, and the relentless voice of grief that prevails when we carry burdens never meant to be ours. It’s for readers who crave introspective, emotionally layered fiction with a sharp psychological edge.

Labor

The background was static. 

Weeks later, I’d think of it as the appropriate prelude: the blankness of my own silence, where everything would come to begin and end, obscured by pink noise and babies screaming as the plane reached altitude. Static. The soundtrack to my own unraveling. If I closed my eyes, I could almost hear her voice in it—an echo, a ghost of something unfinished.

It was Monday. The first one of my adult life I wouldn’t groan at the alarm, stumble from bed, struggle through a hellish commute, and squint in fluorescent lighting whispering “Monday” under my breath like a curse. Instead, I was here, drenched and silent as the damp grey-haired woman next to me berated our weary flight attendant. Red wine pooling on my pants like blood. 

I was helpless to stop it. My hands—stained, sticky, trembling—just like the day the EMTs came. The scent of iron thick in my throat. Breathing too shallow, too quick. White knuckles clenching the napkin. The spiral pulling closer.

My seatmate screeched about dry cleaning costs to the depleted woman in front of her, a trained first responder responsible for saving all of our lives during an accident. The world had declared the pandemic over by then. Our respect, or whatever respect we’d pretended to have, for “essential workers” was long gone. 

Instead, my neighbor’s shrill voice drowned out the static, clucking and cracking over the sound of apologies offered like a dying man begging for water. 

I was frozen, powerless to help. My very reason for even being here as blurred as the perfume of overripe anxiety and stale plane coffee emanating from my seat. I’d given up my role at Quality Health—my last tie to my home sloughed off as easily as a knocked-over glass of wine.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a wooden bowl goes beyond mere aesthetics; the material, dimensions, and finish significantly influence its performance and longevity. Understanding these key features is crucial for selecting the perfect wooden bowl.

**Wood Type**

Different wood types offer unique characteristics. Hardwoods like maple, walnut, and cherry boast durability and resistance to scratches. These woods are less porous,making them hygienic and easy to clean. Softer woods like acacia and bamboo, while often more affordable and sustainable, may require more care and can be more susceptible to damage. Consider the intended use and desired aesthetic when choosing the wood type.

**Size and Shape**

Wooden bowls come in various sizes, ranging from small ramekins for condiments to large salad bowls. The shape, whether round, oval, or square, also plays a role. Smaller bowls are ideal for individual servings or prepping ingredients, while larger bowls are perfect for entertaining or showcasing salads. The depth of the bowl impacts its functionality – deeper bowls minimize spills, while shallower bowls offer easy access.

**Finish and Sealing**

The finish of a wooden bowl protects the wood and enhances its natural beauty. Food-safe finishes, such as mineral oil, beeswax, or a combination of both, are essential for bowls intended for food contact.These finishes penetrate the wood,creating a barrier against moisture and preventing cracking. bowls with a glossy lacquer or varnish finish are generally better suited for decorative purposes, as these finishes are not always food-safe and can chip or peel over time.

**Construction and Craftsmanship**

The construction of a wooden bowl reveals its quality. Look for bowls that are crafted from a single piece of wood or seamlessly joined segments. Inspect the bowl for any cracks, knots, or imperfections that may compromise its structural integrity. Hand-turned bowls frequently enough display unique characteristics and artisanal craftsmanship, making them prized possessions. More mass-produced bowls offer consistency and affordability.**Care and Maintenance**

Understanding how to care for a wooden bowl is essential for prolonging its lifespan. Avoid placing wooden bowls in the dishwasher or soaking them in water, as this can cause warping or cracking. Hand washing with mild soap and water is recommended. Regularly re-oiling the bowl with food-safe mineral oil helps maintain its moisture content and prevents drying out. Proper care ensures that your wooden bowl remains a cherished kitchen staple for years to come.

The natural oils in the wood prevent the absorption of odors and flavors, ensuring that your food tastes fresh.Choosing a sustainably sourced wooden bowl also supports environmentally responsible practices. Bamboo and reclaimed wood options offer eco-friendly alternatives to traditional hardwoods.

**Durability and Longevity**

Maybe I am the strange one here?

My friend and I are both '94 babies, so young Millennials. A couple of months ago he moved into the apartment above me. We both thought that was amazing luck! We could hang out  without having to drive somewhere! How cool! The problem is my friend keeps insisting that I hang out with him *all night* until we basically crash at his place.

My idea of hanging out is just chilling over coffee and maybe a movie. His idea of hanging out is going to see a movie in a group, then moving the group to a club, then coming back to his apartment to play video games until everyone passes out because ""that's how we used to do it"". I know that's how we used to do it as kids/teens, but I'm now 30, perpetually tired, and squishy. I just don't have it in me anymore, and to be honest after working all week I would much rather spend my weekend inside of my apartment.

He keeps guilt tripping me that I only spend an hour or so a week at his place, but I keep telling him that's an hour of my day I take away from my home, my husband, and myself to spend time with him.

I do remember as a kid my friends would stay over so often my parents got me a bunk bed just so everyone would have a place to sleep when we all inevitably crashed. I know that all night hang out sessions were a thing, but do Millennials still do that? If you do still hang out until you crash how often? Am I just being a stick in mud/ being a bad friend?

I am attempting to help out my cafe by creating a P&L for my shop. I went from retail management where we lived and breathed P&L plans to a small local cafe where the finances are kinda like the Wild West. 

I’d assume it’s harder to be as detailed in a P&L in a restaurant setting than it is retail. But I do think it’d be great to get the basics into a document. COGS/Labor/Rent&Utilities/etc… do any of you have examples from your shop or things you’ve used in the past? I know the information I’d like to have. Just not sure how to format it.

Right now I’m having to both breastfeed and pump. My baby doesn’t always fully drain me, but she also doesn’t consistently take a bottle. She prefers nursing, even though my letdown can be slow. I was working on building a freezer stash, but now I have an oversupply, so I have to do both breastfeeding and pumping to stay comfortable and avoid clogs. She still eats every two hours because she was born small and eats frequently.

On top of that, I have a lot of food allergies (from a Lone Star tick bite), and even a small exposure makes me feel extremely fatigued. It feels like I’m reacting to everything I eat. I already wake up exhausted, and without coffee I feel completely depleted.

My husband says many women handle things on their own when their husbands are out of town, and that I’m overreacting. He says I just need to do better at waking up and taking care of our baby by myself.

Long story short but I live in a small town in the UK and since there's not a lot of dating opportunities here I met a really nice girl on hinge last year and we started talking. When she eventually moved to my town we went on a date, kissed, and things seemed to be good. Fast forward and she friendzones me but we end up reconnecting platonically but I think in some meaningful way. We jam some music, go to the gym, watch films etc, it feels nice, maybe like it has potential. She then goes home for Christmas so there's this like natural break for about a month. When she comes back I wait her for to reach out but she doesn't so I assume its done and just start to move on. 

Bare in mind during this time she lives like TWO streets away and even now she lives like 3 minutes down the road, so I spot her around town sometimes and even now we go to the same gym. 

A few weeks ago I spot her walking down the other side of the street and we just ignore each other but I HATE it, so I go home and work up the courage to send her a message basically just saying that there's no hard feelings and that I hope she's doing good. This eventually evolves into her suggesting to catch up over coffee once she's back from holiday, which I accept. So for the past week I've kinda been expecting it.

The thing is I unfollowed her back in April just so I could move on and was meaning to refollow literally tomorrow but tonight, literally an hour ago I notice she's unfollowed me...

This SUCKS, especially because of the history and proximity. The thing is whilst she was away I noticed that she might have started a relationship with someone..., I saw these signs literally a week after she suggested coffee. 

Now I'm in this kinda regretful spot of not refollowing sooner, wanting to genuinely catch up like we suggested and not have this awkwardness in such a small town, especially when we share the same gym and had some nice hangs with each other.

I know she was probs waiting for me to refollow but I wait to do it as not to put pressure on her.

Don't get me wrong, it's DONE, I'm just a bit sad about closing this chapter especially since we live so close and I can see her literally any time.

Any advice? I feel like this whole last month has been a product of miscommunication.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WNBA Showdown: Minnesota Lynx vs. Chicago Sky – A Same-Game Parlay Breakdown**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of *dominance* and *desperation*—the Minnesota Lynx (20-4), fresh off a 10-game gauntlet, are hosting the Chicago Sky (7-15) in a clash that’s less “game” and more “Masterclass in Basketball 101.” Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and find the best same-game parlay, all while keeping it *lightly absurd*.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The Lynx are favored by **15.5-16 points** across all bookmakers, with moneyline odds ranging from **-980 to -1000** (decimal: \~1.05-1.09). That’s the WNBA equivalent of betting on gravity—yes, it works, but do you *really* need to?

* **Implied Probabilities**:
   * Lynx to win: **\~93-95%** (based on -980 odds).
   * Sky to win: **\~10-11%** (based on +800-850 odds).
   * Total points: **159.0-159.5**, with Over/Under odds hovering around **1.90-1.95** (implied 51-53% for Over).

The Lynx’s **9.7-point scoring edge** this season is staggering, while the Sky’s **78 PPG average** is so low, they’d need a *math error* just to hit 80. Napheesa Collier (23.2 PPG) is a beast, and the Sky’s defense? Well, they’re the team that accidentally invented “slow mode.”

---

### 2. Digest the News: Fatigue, Fame, and Angelic Struggles

The Lynx just played **10 games in 20 days**, including two against the Sky. Courtney Williams, their maestro, is “mentally worn out from a busy weekend”—read: she’s probably Googling “how to nap during a press conference.” Meanwhile, the Sky’s Angel Reese is their lone bright spot, averaging double-doubles, but even she can’t outwork a team that scores like a dial-up modem.

Key injury notes? None for the Lynx, but the Sky’s Ariel Atkins (defensive anchor) is still… *motivated*. Let’s just say the Lynx’s home-court advantage (4-0) is as reliable as your morning coffee—*non-negotiable*.

### 3. Humorous Spin: Basketball, But Make It Comedic

I made a Chemex the other day and didn’t taste the acidity at step 7 Gen 2 Burrs on the Ode. 

I use around 205degree water. I also use a chopstick to swirl a tunnel down the grounds to get to center of cone. I let rest for 45sec after bloom.

Yes I know the chemex paper is uneven in filtration. Because I’m doing 30oz of coffee I don’t care enough to go hario v60. 

Any tips or tricks to help? I don’t want to go too fine and overextract. I think that would give me what I don’t want. I’ve tried from 5-6-7 and I had a good cup at 7. Could have been just that day. After tooth brush who knows. I liked it and have stuck with it for a couple days. I am pretty new to the game.

**You’ll never build wealth if you don’t make money while you sleep.**  
And yes, you can start while you’re grounded on a layover — with just a phone and Wi-Fi.

# Layovers Are Your Secret Business Hours

You already:

* Have hours of downtime between flights
* Know how to work under pressure
* Manage unpredictable schedules
* Carry a phone or laptop everywhere

That’s the perfect setup for **building passive income.**

Whether you’re parked at the airport hotel, sitting at a gate, or sipping coffee in the crew lounge — those moments can be monetized.

# The Truth: You Can’t Build Passive Income Without a Website

TikTok is cute. IG is fine. But if you're serious about earning money online, you need a **website** that:

* Builds authority
* Makes you searchable
* Hosts affiliate links
* Sells digital products while you’re flying
* Collects emails for future marketing

Don’t overthink it — use what you already know.

**1. Travel Hacks & Layover Guides**  
→ Create city-specific guides for crew  
→ Share hotel reviews, food spots, safety tips  
→ Monetize with affiliate links to travel gear or hotel deals

# Want to Be Taken Seriously? You Need an LLC

Airlines can furlough. Pay can fluctuate.  
But your **business** needs protection and legitimacy.

Registering an LLC helps you:

* Open a business bank account
* Deduct travel expenses, Wi-Fi, gear
* Apply for business funding
* Separate your side hustle from your personal life

📝 [Register your LLC in minutes here](https://www.pasosdeals.com/mycorp)  
It’s how you go from “blogger” to **business owner.**

# Still Doubting? Look What Layovers Are Really Worth…

If you work:

* 4 layovers/week
* With 4 hours of downtime each
* That’s **16 hours/week** you could use to build assets

That’s a part-time business.  
And the best part? Once the content is up — it earns while you’re asleep mid-flight.

# Flight Attendants Are Built for Business

✈️ You’re resilient  
✈️ You know how to connect with people  
✈️ You already live a digital, on-the-go lifestyle

You don’t need to quit flying.

1m6tep0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m6tep0/aio_for_being_upset_when_i_found_out_my_ex_was/,AIO for being upset when I found out my ex was now dating his best friend’s ex wife?,"
I (36F) was with my ex Jamie (37M) for almost my entire 20s. We met when I was fresh out of college and moved back to my hometown, while he was studying his postgrad there. We met through a mutual friend and became inseparable right away. 

We moved in together when he graduated and had our ups and downs, but he was my absolute best friend in the world. We had so many inside jokes, finished each other’s sentences … I loved everything about him. I thought we would get married, have kids, grow old together. 

Our sex life started out amazing, but began to die down after a year or two living together. I thought that was probably normal, until we were at the point where six months, even a year would go by without him initiating anything. And when I tried, he didn’t feel like it or was tired, or I’d done something to turn him off me. I know he was sometimes frustrated with me - I grew up spoiled as an only child from an affluent family, and wasn’t always the most responsible with my money or doing chores - it was something I tried to work on but didn’t come naturally to me. And this impacted how attracted he was to me, I suppose. I get it, I know there are plenty of wives with lazy husbands who feel the same way. (I’m much better with both these days.) I don’t blame him for that, but I stopped trying because it hurt to be turned down all the time, so I guess we were both in a rut. 

Jamie had a group of friends from school who still hung out all the time, along with all the girlfriends. Let’s call them Tom and Tara, Annie and Adam, and Lucy and Louis. Tom and Tara lived in the same town as us and we saw them like once a week at least, and I loved them the most. The others lived a couple of hours away and we’d get together every 6 months or so, booking a weekend away together or mini break, or visiting Annie and Adam at their house in the countryside. 

Adam was Jamie’s best friend from school. When I was 26, Annie and Adam got married and we went to the wedding, and Jamie was best man. We had the best time, dancing all night. We even had amazing sex that night. Everything was perfect. 

As friends, we were a tight unit, though we all thought Annie was hard work sometimes and was the kind of person who confuses being funny with actually being plain rude. She also copied my style a lot - dyed her hair the same colour, wore similar vintage dresses to me - but I took it as a compliment. She was always nice to me, and as a group we got on great. 

Anyway, when Jamie was 27, he had a severe health scare and was hospitalized. He then had to take 6 months off work recovering. This was when things really changed. He saw life differently and I guess he thought we were wasting our lives - neither of us particularly liked our jobs, but we were living a comfortable lifestyle together. His metal health had been impacted by the whole situation and he wasn’t as outgoing any more. Although we were still the same with each other, it felt like something was fading, and 18 months later he broke up with me. 

Even though retrospectively I can see the signs, at the time I was blindsided. A decade together, all my future plans, gone in an afternoon of tears and heartbreak. We were holding each other back from a more fulfilling life apart, according to him (quite possibly true). He was moving out of our apartment and up to the country to live near Adam and Annie. I decided to move away as well, start a new life away from everyone and everything. We said we would stay friends and maybe even keep the door open to reunite at some point, when we were at different places in our lives. 

We kept in touch to an extent - we had been best friends for years, after all. Still sent birthday and Christmas messages, occasional updates. We never mentioned new relationships to each other, but I knew in all likelihood, we were both dating. He told me after a year that Adam and Annie were getting divorced and it was all pretty messy - Adam gave Jamie an ultimatum that he couldn’t stay friends with Annie, and of course he chose his best friend. 

So now 5 years have gone by since the breakup. I’ve had another long term partner since, but I never felt the same way about him as I did with Jamie, and eventually we broke up when I realised my heart was never going to be in it 100%. I decide maybe it’s time to stop running away. I come home for Christmas to see my family. I message Jamie to see how his Christmas is and we make friendly small talk about his family, who were always lovely to me. All completely normal, we say we’ll meet up for coffee at some point, when she’s down visiting Tom and Tara, who are still living in my hometown. I guess a part of me still holds out that maybe we’ll meet and the old spark will be there … maybe we can try again? A part of me still loves him. Maybe always will. 

I actually bump into Tom and Tara the next week, and Tara and I decide to go for a drink and catch up. She asks me how I’m feeling about the situation. I ask, what situation? She’s confused. It’s been on social media, so she thought I knew. For the last 6 months, Jamie and Annie have been in a relationship. What? WHAT! Jamie and Annie??? No way! I feel sick. I feel like I’ve been kicked in the stomach. 

Jamie didn’t mention it at all in our Christmas exchange. Annie, it turns out, has blocked me on social media, so I don’t see any of her posts about the two of them. There’s no way Adam would be supportive of that relationship, so he must have also ditched his best friend for her. 

This is where I am probably in the wrong and overreacted. That night I get drunk and I go ballistic at Jamie over text. We can’t be friends, I can never talk to him again. I was still in love with him and I can’t bring myself to be happy for him in the new relationship, not when it’s with her. I can’t believe he didn’t tell me himself, when we’ve been texting for the last week and he said nothing. I send all sorts of embarrassing things, pouring my heart out as I sob myself to sleep. 

In the morning, I wake up full of dread and regret. It’s been over 5 years since we broke up. He’s free to date whoever he likes, and he doesn’t owe me anything. And worst, he’s replied before I could delete it. He’s so kind. But also kinda reiterates the same thing - it’s been a long time since we broke up and his feelings for me aren’t there any more. He hopes we can still be friends. 

The thing is, I don’t think I can be his friend. I don’t know if I can get over how hurt I felt when I found out about their relationship. It’s probably petty of me, but I’m a mess of emotions about the whole thing. So AIO for still being upset that my ex is dating his best friend’s ex? ",2,1753226350.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I first started buying Sonos stuff probably 12 years ago, so there a fair bit around the house. Most of it is S2 compatible now, but there is still 4 old S1 devices that I’m happy to stay like that because they’re just operating obscure areas like the garage.

So, I’ve got a regular speaker pairing that’s started bugging me. I have an old Play 1 mounted in the corner of my kitchen, right above my espresso machine. And at the other end of the kitchen, I’ve got a relatively new ERA 300. Now, I’m not sure if the old Play 1 is dying or I’m just noticing it now, but the sound quality is a real letdown compared to the ERA 300. Yes, I’ve done that TruPlay tuning already. But the ERA 300 is so clear and fantastic by comparison! I realised that the ERA 300 is a better speaker anyway, but are the older Play 1 speakers just not that good? And am I only just noticing it now? I’m thinking I need an ERA 100 above the coffee machine instead. So that also means a new wall mount, any suggestions on a wall mount?

Having two more Play 1 speakers as surround speakers to an ARC soundbar has me thinking that they might not be good enough to fully enhance the home theatre experience. As a result, I’m considering upgrading them to an ERA 100 surround speakers. And that leads me onto the next question, as the current surround speakers are ceiling mounted, what do you all recommend as the best ceiling mount to use for an ERA 100?

Apologies for the rambling. 

TLDR; probably going to replace some old Play 1 speakers with ERA 100 speakers. Also after recommendations on wall and ceiling mounts for the ERA 100s.",1,1753226082.0,sonos,1,0.67,False

1m6tagl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6tagl,Need some advice for a little situation w/ seller.,"I'm feeling really frustrated and a bit worried about a recent Depop purchase and hoping for some input from you guys.

I bought a pair of white cargo pants and overalls from a seller a couple of weeks ago. I finally opened the package early this morning to do some laundry.

Upon quick inspection, I immediately noticed a significant number of stains on the overalls. There's a big brown stain that looks like coffee or a chocolatey drink, a smaller, weird orange stain, and several other smaller marks. All these stains look pretty faded, almost as if the seller tried to clean them thoroughly before shipping. The cargo pants seem fine, just really big.

The original listing photos were taken from a distance (which I assumed was just to show the full item), and the seller's description mentioned nothing about any staining - they even claimed the item was in ""good condition.""

I messaged the seller today to ask about the stains and see if we could work something out, like a refund for the overalls. They responded quickly and politely at first, which was promising. However, shortly after that exchange, their profile completely disappeared/became unavailable. When I try to access it now, it says ""This profile isn't available,"" which makes me think they might have blocked me or deleted their account.

I couldn't send photos of the stains right away because I'm currently at school, but I will be providing clear pictures by 5:00 PM PDT today.

I'm disappointed, especially since the overalls are also huge on me, but I know the sizing is an inherent risk of online shopping and not the seller's fault. My main concern is the undisclosed and significant stains on the item sold as ""good condition,"" combined with the seller's sudden disappearance.

Have I done anything wrong in this situation? Am I being unfair by asking for a refund for the overalls?

I'm genuinely worried about how to proceed. I plan to take this directly to Depop support sometime after 6:00 PM PDT today, but any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated! 😭",1,1753226046.0,Depop,1,1.0,False
1m6t8l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/libra_astrology/comments/1m6t8l5/the_hardest_job_in_the_zodiac/,The hardest job in the zodiac,"TL;DR:

Libra has the hardest task in the zodiac:
Becoming ourselves through everyone else, but with a banging soundtrack, wardrobe, hair,  makeup and the can do attitude of someone armed with generic phrases about the power of love.

No other sign does it the way we do. Nor do they get what that even means.
Not even the other so-called “social signs.”

Well… Pisces almost understands.
But they quit halfway through—
dissolving into the abyss
(Mutable signs, am I right?)

But Cardinal Air doesn’t quit—
we coordinate the collapse with a smile.

So most of us have a general understanding of what each sign brings to the table and the lessons they’re here to teach. If you asked me who has the hardest time fulfilling their cosmic duty, I used to say Pisces and keep it moving. Since they’re tasked with being everything and nothing all at once.

But honestly? I think it’s Libra who has the toughest assignment.

Unlike Pisces, we don’t get an “out.” We don’t dissolve. We don’t escape. Instead, we’re asked to spend a majority of our lives dissecting and analyzing every relationship, every interaction, just to find our own center and then maintain it while balancing both the seen and the unseen.

We are the only sign whose selfhood is discovered through relationship. Not just romantic ones. All of them. Every dynamic. Every archetype. Every pattern.

We’re the only ones who constantly ask:

>“Who am I in the presence of, and in relation to, this person, this energy, this structure, this imbalance?

>What must I become to honor both you and me?”

And then we do that again.
And again.
And again.

Not because we’re codependent. Not because we’ll lose ourselves if we don’t.
But because that’s how we ascend. That’s how we become whole.

Our existence is a living dialogue with the world. We aren’t a fixed point. We are the space between, where hard meets soft, noise meets silence, chaos meets order.

Step one: Know everything through relation.
Step two: Prove your knowing through mirroring.
Step three: Rinse, repeat, finesse, keep the group chat fair and balanced, and maybe crash out beautifully. 

We commune with the karmic past while simultaneously giving a presentation at work.

Stranger still is the fact that the rest of the zodiac refuses to acknowledge that we are Cardinal air.

People act like Libra is all indecision and aesthetics but we move entire systems through grace.
We organize revolutions through conversation.
We are the winds of change.
Orchestrated upheaval. Curated chaos.
We leave opponents dazed while we’re already out grabbing coffee and catching up with an old friend like nothing happened.

We are both witness and mirror, movement and stillness.
And by the time you figure out what we are, we’ve already become something else. And it’s not to be better than anyone it’s simply because it is what love and justice looks like on a Tuesday.

I think if you’re a libra you’ll get it and if you’re not i think you’ll get it too but I’ll leave everyone with this thought about Libras.

but do you even see what that asks of me?”",21,1753225917.0,libra_astrology,6,1.0,False
1m6t7fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1m6t7fb/ibs_a_special_kind_of_hell/,IBS: A Special Kind of Hell 🌯🍦,"I didn’t know what IBS was until I was diagnosed with it. It doesn’t have its own month like breast 🎗️, or charity walks or fundraisers (at least, I never heard of them). And after I was diagnosed, my GI doc casually referred me to a dietitian while telling me that my colonoscopy was normal. 

Three years later, and I don’t recognize my own life anymore. It robs you of the little things, but you have to find out the hard way… a nice cup of coffee during the winter to get your day started. Ice cream during the summer. Happy hour after work. Pizza on a Friday. Traveling without having to curate your itinerary for dietary restrictions and bathroom accessibility. Working without dashing into the bathroom in between meetings. 

Dating? Moving to a new city? Starting a new job? Any of the risky adventurous shit that adds to the spice of life…but spice and IBS don’t go together. 🙃

I know I’m not the only one who feels they spend more time managing symptoms rather than living in the moment. Trying to explain to others what it’s like without being excessively negative. Trying to let your friends and family know you’re not purposely being a recluse. 

Things that used to be considered goals: an active social life, a challenging career, a solid fitness routine - it all seems theoretical now. Something you “could” achieve if you just had the right attitude, if you just had a little more discipline, a little more grit. 

Fiber supplements, low fodmap diets, peppermint pills, Linzess (it gave me diarrhea everyday for 8 months straight) I’ve tried a lot of stuff. Some of it helps, a lot of it doesn’t. For those who have been dealing with this for years on end, I salute you and feel what you’re going through. I hope one day everyone can figure out how to thrive with IBS and not just manage it. 

“Oh don’t worry, it’s not lethal!”, the doctors tell you this triumphantly. But what they don’t tell you, what you have to find out one day at a time, is that it robs you of the little things. ",23,1753225838.0,ibs,3,1.0,False

What's the actual system for building a non negotiable morning routine?,"I feel like I'm stuck in a loop, and I'm hoping someone here has a perspective that can help me break it. I've read the books, listened to the podcasts, and I intellectually *know* all the benefits of waking up early. I know I *should* just get out of bed. But every single morning, it's an intense mental battle that I inevitably lose.

The frustrating part is how motivated I feel the night before. I'll set my alarm for 6:00 AM with a clear plan: I'll get up, meditate, exercise, and have a quiet cup of coffee before the day's chaos begins. But when that alarm goes off, a different person takes over. My brain becomes a master negotiator, whispering every excuse: ""You didn't sleep well enough,"" ""It's so warm and comfortable,"" ""Five more minutes won't hurt,"" ""You can do that workout later."" Before I know it, I've hit snooze three times and it's 7:15 AM.

I have tried to set my alarm earlier gradually, moving it back by 10 minutes each week, but I always fail in the end and regress back to my old habits. For me, the most difficult part is bridging the gap between my intention the night before and my action in the morning. It feels like a willpower and discipline failure first thing in the day, which sets a negative tone and leaves me feeling guilty and behind schedule before I've even brushed my teeth.

So, for those who've successfully built a solid routine, what was the specific mental shift or tiny habit that made it all click?

* How do you motivate yourself in that split second when the alarm goes off and your mind is screaming ""go back to sleep""?
* What was the key to overcoming that initial, almost physical resistance to leaving the comfort of your bed?
* Was it about finding a powerful ""why,"" or was it more about creating a morning routine so enticing that you actually *wanted* to get up for it?

I'm less interested in generic advice like ""put your alarm across the room"" (I just walk over, turn it off, and get back in bed) and more interested in the psychological change that made it stick for you.

I have student employees that work beer cart, I have been trying to think of a cute farewell gift for my graduating staff that are leaving and had the idea to put “retired cart girl” on something to hand out. I have a Cricut and would make iron on patches or stickers to put on items.

Would a T-shirt be the best thing to make a logo on? I feel like anyone can appreciate a good comfy cotton t-shirt. I want to make something nice, but obviously not spend a bunch of money on these gifts. Probably $10 or less. I also thought a coffee tumbler, Stanley type cup, or belt bag would be cute things that students like these days, but I’m not looking to buy any of the namebrand ones, and I personally am kind of particular about items like that I use. So I figure if I wouldn’t really get much use out of a gift like that, I don’t want to make them to hand out.

If anyone thinks of any alternative ideas that the current student generation would get use out of/appreciate please let me know!
