I figured I'd get a woman's perspective on this because sometimes us men can get overly confident and look too deep into things. There is this girl that I work with who I am very attracted to and I'm trying to guage if she is in to me or just friendly. We've been working together for 2 months now. It all started when I received a message on Facebook one night asking if I wanted her to bring me something from Starbucks the next day, I politely declined and didn't think anything of this. About a week later, she brought me a coffee to work without asking. I didn't think anything of this either but we work with multiple people and I'm the only person who she offered coffee to. Fast forward another week, she calls me and asks me if I want something from another place, didn't offer to anyone else. Plus receiving snapchats from her multiple times a day. Poking fun at me at times. Responding directly to me when I send group emails, typically in a non work relatedjoking manner. Women what do you think? Am I looking too much into this? I've been out of the game for a while so I feel like I'm a child again trying to figure out women.",1,1729447773.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1g84xqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus_Ohio_SEO/comments/1g84xqv/fox_in_the_snow_is_it_worh_it_coffee_shop_in/,Fox in the Snow | Is it Worh it? | Coffee Shop in Columbus,"Nestled in the heart of Columbus, OH, Fox in the Snow is a quaint coffee shop that blends the charm of a cozy caf√© with the allure of a bustling bakery. With its rustic ambiance and tantalizing menu, it‚Äôs no wonder locals and tourists alike flock to this gem. Below is a rundown of some of their menu items, complete with personal experiences, pros, and cons for each.

**Souffled Egg Sandwich ($10)**

Positive:

The Souffled Egg Sandwich at Fox in the Snow is a revelation for breakfast lovers. The eggs are fluffy and light, almost cloud-like in texture, and perfectly complemented by a hint of cheese that melts in your mouth. The bread is freshly baked, soft inside with a crisp crust‚Äîjust the way a good sandwich bread should be. I paired mine with a hot coffee, and it was the perfect start to my day.

Negative:

While the Souffled Egg Sandwich has its charm, I found the flavor profile a bit underwhelming for the price. The eggs, though impeccably fluffy, could use a touch more seasoning. The bread, while fresh, was a tad too thick for my liking, overshadowing the delicate eggs inside. It‚Äôs a decent option, but I wish it had that extra punch to make it truly unforgettable.

Oatmeal with Butter, Brown Sugar, and Milk ($6)

Positive:

There's something so comforting about a bowl of oatmeal, and Fox in the Snow nails it! The combination of butter and brown sugar gives it a delightful richness, while the milk makes it creamy and indulgent. It‚Äôs a warm hug in a bowl, perfect for chilly Columbus mornings. I love that they keep it simple yet satisfying.

Negative:

I was drawn to the idea of oatmeal with a buttery twist, but found it a bit too rich for my taste. The butter overpowered the subtle sweetness of the brown sugar, and I ended up craving some fruit or nuts to add a bit of texture and balance. It's not bad, but maybe a tad indulgent for an everyday oatmeal.

**Granola with Yogurt and Blueberries ($7.25)**

Positive:

Fox in the Snow‚Äôs granola is a delightful blend of crunchy and chewy. The yogurt is tangy and smooth, providing the perfect base for the sweet, plump blueberries. It‚Äôs a refreshing choice for anyone looking for a healthier option without sacrificing taste. This is my go-to order when I want something light yet filling.

Negative:

The granola itself is tasty, but the portion was smaller than I‚Äôd expected for the price. While the yogurt and blueberries were fresh, the dish felt more like a snack than a meal. I found myself wishing there was a bit more heft to it, maybe with some nuts or seeds to keep me fuller longer.

**Ham Baguette Sandwich ($9.25)**

Positive:

The Ham Baguette Sandwich is a classic done right. The baguette is just the right amount of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, filled generously with quality ham. It‚Äôs simple, no-fuss, and absolutely delicious. Perfect for a quick lunch that doesn‚Äôt skimp on flavor.

Negative:

For a baguette sandwich, I found it slightly lacking in terms of excitement. The ham is good, but the sandwich could benefit from a spread or condiment to elevate it. It‚Äôs good if you enjoy simplicity, but I was hoping for just a bit more flair to make it stand out.

**Tomato Pesto Baguette Sandwich ($9.75)**

Positive:

This sandwich is a vegetarian dream! The combination of ripe tomatoes with fragrant pesto is divine, packed inside a perfectly baked baguette. Each bite bursts with flavor, and the freshness of the ingredients really shines through. It‚Äôs a deliciously satisfying choice that feels both hearty and healthy.

Negative:

While the flavor is there, the sandwich suffered from a bit of sogginess due to the juicy tomatoes. By the time I was halfway through, the bread had lost its structure. A little more care in assembly would go a long way in keeping this as delightful as its flavor promises.

**Ham & Swiss Croissant ($4.75)**

Positive:

The Ham & Swiss Croissant is everything a good pastry should be‚Äîflaky, buttery, and melt-in-your-mouth good. The savory filling of ham and Swiss cheese complements the sweet pastry perfectly. It‚Äôs a small piece of heaven that I find myself craving regularly.

Negative:

Though the croissant is delicious, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel it was a bit too greasy for my liking. The buttery pastry combined with the cheese made it feel a little heavy. It‚Äôs definitely tasty, but maybe best reserved for an occasional treat rather than a regular order.

**Cinnamon Roll ($5)**

Positive:

Oh, the cinnamon roll! It‚Äôs pure indulgence‚Äîa swirl of cinnamon and sugar encased in a soft, fluffy roll, topped with just the right amount of icing. It‚Äôs sweet without being cloying and pairs beautifully with a cup of their rich coffee. A must-try if you have a sweet tooth!

Negative:

While the cinnamon roll was good, I found the icing a bit overwhelming. It‚Äôs a dessert lover‚Äôs paradise, but those who prefer less sweetness might find it a bit much. I ended up scraping some off, which helped balance it out.

**Sticky Bun ($5)**

Positive:

The sticky bun at Fox in the Snow is a decadent treat. It‚Äôs gooey, sweet, and absolutely delicious. The caramel glaze is rich and perfect, making each bite a delightful mix of textures. It‚Äôs one of those treats best enjoyed slowly, savoring every moment.

Negative:

My only qualm with the sticky bun is that it was a bit too sweet for my taste. The caramel, while delicious, was very rich and made it hard to finish. It‚Äôs definitely a treat, but perhaps best shared with a friend.

**Hot Chocolate ($4.75)**

Positive:

Their hot chocolate is like a warm hug in a mug. Rich, creamy, and satisfyingly sweet, it‚Äôs the perfect choice for a cold day. The balance of flavors is spot on, and it‚Äôs the perfect accompaniment to any of their pastries.

Negative:

While I enjoyed the flavor, I found the hot chocolate a bit too rich for my taste. It‚Äôs wonderfully indulgent, but perhaps a bit too heavy if you‚Äôre not in the mood for something so sweet. A smaller serving would be ideal for a light afternoon pick-me-up.

**Chai ($4.50)**

Positive:

Fox in the Snow‚Äôs chai is a delight for the senses. It‚Äôs aromatic, perfectly spiced, and warms you from the inside out. The balance of spices is just right, making for a soothing and comforting drink. It‚Äôs my top choice when I need a cozy moment.

Negative:

While the chai has a lovely flavor, I found it a bit too milky for my liking. I prefer a stronger spice kick, so it didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark for me. However, it‚Äôs still a nice, warming option for those who enjoy a milder chai.

**Iced Coffee ($4)**

Positive:

Their iced coffee is refreshing and robust, with a nice smoothness that makes it easy to drink. It‚Äôs got the right amount of kick to wake you up, without any unnecessary bitterness. Perfect for when you need a cool, caffeinated treat.

Negative:

While solid, I found the iced coffee a bit too watered down. I missed the rich, bold flavor I usually crave in an iced coffee. It‚Äôs refreshing for sure, but could use a bit more coffee punch to really shine.

**New Orleans Iced Coffee**

Positive:

Fox in the Snow‚Äôs New Orleans Iced Coffee is a game-changer. It‚Äôs creamy, with a delightful hint of chicory that adds depth and complexity. This is my absolute favorite summer drink, offering a unique flavor profile that‚Äôs hard to resist.

Negative:

Though the concept is intriguing, the chicory flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. It‚Äôs definitely unique, but if you‚Äôre not a fan of chicory, it might not be your cup of tea (or coffee). I‚Äôd recommend trying a sample first to see if it‚Äôs for you.

Overall, Fox in the Snow offers a diverse menu with something for everyone. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for a hearty sandwich, a sweet treat, or a comforting beverage, they‚Äôve got you covered.

Gf F19 me F20 together for almost 2 yrs,"So this past month has been super hard on the relationship. My gf has had finals and the classes she's taking were really hard. This month we haven't gone in a single date, she hasn't bought me flowers, she hasn't been as romantic, and our intimate life has gone way down hill. This is really unusual for her. She usually constantly surprises me with gifts, dates, and we had a really flourishing intimate life. I chalked it up to just stress from school but now I'm getting really suspicious. My gf has a new work friend, they got really close really fast. It started at the beginning of the month too. They even went to study at the college together with another friend. My gf works at Starbucks and when we were going to go on our first date in a month we decided to get coffee. Well this friend was the one who gave us the drinks. She sarted saying things like ""Is that my pookie? Where are you going? I'm gonna miss you I wish I could come with you! I'll see you soon! I'll miss you so much"" in front of me in a baby pouting voice. She completely ignored me and didn't even look at me. I even told her to have a good day and she just brushed it off. She also knows I'm my partner's gf. My gf didn't see anything wrong with it when I brought up I was uncomfortable. She played it off as ""Oh I'm sure she talks to everyone like that"". 
I was really uncomfortable and so I decided to look at my gf's discord. I know it's wrong and I feel bad but I didn't want to immediately jump to jealousy and make my gf not want to make new friends. I knew I wasn't going to find anything but I've been cheated on before and seeing with my own eyes that it's just my delusions makes it so much better. But... I found out she's been chatting with a girl on there for an entire month. Completely different girl. My gf hasn't said a single thing to me about this new friend but looking at their chats they seem to be ""super close friends"". My gf tells me everything but she for some reason kept having a ""super close"" friend from me? 99% of their conversation was talking about how amazing it was they both were gay and the girl comparing my gf to one of her fictional crushes. 
I'm starting to wonder if my gf pulled so far away from me because rn she's busy giving attention to other women... I know I have some trust issues and trauma with being cheated on. I'm trying to work on it. That's why I want to know if I'm just being overly jealous and need to apologize to her or if this actually suspicious behavior and we need to have a serious discussion 

TDLR: My gf has been slightly neglectful towards our relationship. I chalked it up to her being stressed about school. Found out her coworker was being slightly flirty and my gf was having conversations about how amazing it is she and an online friend she's never told me about are both gay.

1g84tdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1g84tdj/any_experience_with_rehydrating_beans_andor_cheap/,Any experience with rehydrating beans and/or cheap moisture meters? ,"Hi guys,

I am a relatively beginner to roasting, i have been roasting with a Behmor 2020AB for a year and have just upgraded to a Kaffelogic Nano 7e a couple of months ago. My roasts have definately improved by upgrading to a Kaffelogic Nano. Repeatability, Logging of roasts and ease of use have just been great with the Kaffelogic. I'm not bothered by the low gram capability because i roast to learn the process, and now i have 3/4 learning moments a week!

Recently ive been looking into rehydrating my beans (thanks Christopher Ferran and your rehydrating protocol!) but i am just guessing the moisture content of my beans. I cant justify buying a moisture meter (yet), because the good ones are around 900$? Are there other (DIY) options?

So far my results have been great with non-rehydrated beans, but i sense there's more to the beans i'm roasting. I must say that i mainly roast for pourover with lighter roasts, a bit like nordic style but most of the time a little bit darker but still considerd light. Now with rehydrated beans it seems more of a hit and miss and it looks like they are definately not as evenly roasted as the non-rehydrated beans. Now this either has to do with the moisture not being evenly distributed through the coffee, or that coffee with a higher moisture percentage is just harder to work with. Now i just guess my moisture percentage is around 10/11% and want to up this to around 16%. So i take 95gr coffee and add 5gr of water and let it sit for at least 8 hours in a sealed plastic container, stored at room temperature. 

My best guess now is to just try and go for a replicable recipe (95gr green coffee +5gr water) and go from there, but looking forward to suggestions/tips/tricks! If you need more information, dont hesitate to ask. ",1,1729447337.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

As of this morning, I have lost 5 KG (11 pounds), -1.6 BMI and -2.4% body fat. 
I‚Äôve been wearing an Apple Watch to monitor my heart rate and noticed a drop in resting heart rate. I‚Äôve been sleeping with the watch and have received several alerts through the night of my HR going below 45, which is interesting.  
Also, I regularly take allergies medication. But haven‚Äôt taken it through my fast and have not had any alert symptoms which is also interesting. I wonder is there‚Äôs any science to back that up. 

My plan is to start refeed slowly later today and continue doing keto for the rest of the week and see if I can lost a few more pounds. 
I do not feel any cravings but miss eggs a lot!

No one understands beyond the actions of one man, on one night. They cast judgment, but that isn‚Äôt fair. There is an entire love story there.¬†

I need to finally tell it from the beginning. Because though it was tragic, it was also my favourite love story‚Ä¶.¬†

***THE LOVE STORY - PART 1 - PRE-JAIL***

The first time I saw his face, I remember thinking ‚ÄúThose eyes are amazing‚Äù.¬†

The first time he ever sent me a message on Messenger, his first words were ‚ÄúHey gorgeous‚Äù. And that made me smile and blush a little, luckily, he couldn‚Äôt see it. We talked a lot about his anger and his ex, missing his kids. I was trying to be a friend. At that moment, I didn‚Äôt even think of him romantically - he lived in Ocean City Maryland. I lived in Windsor Ontario Canada.

Plus, if we are being honest, he seemed a little ‚Äútragic‚Äù for me. No home, anger, drinking, mental health, and a lot of fixations on the ways his ex hurt him. How much he missed his kids though, was so sweet. He was cute, and so was his dog, but it didn‚Äôt seem logical. So instead, I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be nice, he seems sad‚Äù.¬†

¬†But during our first ‚Äútext battle‚Äù my perspective shifted. Soon I realized his story was more about endurance the longer we talked. He went from ‚Äútragic‚Äù to ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù in one night flat. I was amazed at all he overcame or was trying to overcome.¬†

¬†After the first ‚Äútext battle‚Äù, we didn‚Äôt talk for a few days. Then he asked about how beef livers were so high in zinc on Facebook. I knew this, sadly. So I messaged him the answer. Who would have thought Beef Liver would be the true start of a love story?¬†

We talked constantly after this. Every ding on my phone would make me smile, especially when it was for him. After a while, he asked to video call. I was so nervous. I hate my voice and phones and being on camera. But I agreed.¬†

That call lasted for literal hours. We laughed hysterically. He was doing karate moves on his hotel bed at one point. I remember thinking, how could this person exist?! We randomly made noises. It was the first time I heard him say ‚Äúbeep beep, I a sheep‚Äù

¬†I never felt so safe to be me, or genuinely happy.

¬†After that we were inseparable. Every break, every minute I wasn‚Äôt working, we were on a call. I walked with him when he went out with Thor. I walked with him on beaches. I went on bike rides - and if I couldn‚Äôt go, he‚Äôd send me videos of it. He would take me shopping, and I‚Äôd take him when I went to the river or the lake. We would go to restaurants and eat together on a call. I remember him ordering pizza with an inordinate amount of pineapple and wondering if he was my soul mate. I remember that every time he went through the sliding doors at the hotel the phone would glitch, and that oddly began to feel like home. I don‚Äôt know the exact moment I knew I loved him; but I knew from the second call I was going to.¬†

We were always on the same wavelength. I didn‚Äôt know all his music, but I knew some of it. That felt like it was enough. We had a lot of other things in common, including our ADHD, our love for pineapple, water, science, and chicken wings. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was enough. We talked about trips and places we wanted to go. We made dreams.¬†

¬†We sang Hakuna Matattata, random DMX, Eminem and other silly songs. We always sang ‚ÄúI wanna kiss you all over‚Äù. I would sing ‚Äútill the night closes in‚Äù so loud and so terribly. We could somehow talk about everything and nothing simultaneously. Eventually, we both opened up about our trauma. He seemed so deeply understanding. It was the first time I didn‚Äôt have it used against me. He told me about what his dad and his brother did to him, and I remember just crying.¬†

His calls were my happy place.¬†

I remember one night, in a moment of honesty, looking at him and saying ‚ÄúI know this will end badly‚Äù. That night was the first pinky promise we ever made. The rules: 1) we never stop fighting or give up on each other; 2) we will always be best friends; 3) we always forgive each other as long as there isn‚Äôt physical violence, cheating, or abandonment. I took that pinky promise with me every day going forward, and let it guide me, even in moments of fear when I wanted to run away.

Pinky promises became our thing.

The day he told me he loved me; I sent a hilarious goofy picture from the tub. He just blurted it out. I returned an ‚ÄúI love you too‚Äù, gleefully. It was true. I loved this man, no matter how complicated this would be.

¬†Mid-January, he moved in with a woman named Heather. I was uncomfortable, I put up a fight, but he said she was 70. This wasn‚Äôt a great time initially if I am being honest. He disappeared for multiple days and was angry with me. He would tell me to call at a time, and when I did, he got angry. One night when drinking and ignoring me, he got upset and said, ‚ÄúI had to pay the piper‚Äù. Those words still haunt me. But after a few days, we were in contact again. So, I let it go, though the uneasiness and discomfort never really 100% went.

¬†However, I let it slip my mind. We started talking constantly at that point. I would even leave him on the phone when I wasn‚Äôt in the room, muted. Some days we had 19-hour calls. During this time though, there were amazing memories. We got closer intimately. We also would do paint nights. He got me painting again. He would play the guitar. I would create pictures for him. He was so supportive of my art. He would fall asleep beside me on the phone. He would sing me to sleep. He had his own spot in my bed I‚Äôd prop him up so he could see me. He told me he would keep me safe. I slept so peacefully. I would wake up and see him, and everything was perfect.¬†

I learned during this time he had a bit of a temper. It came out mostly with Duck Dog. Though we made it a joke. I learned also during this time; he didn‚Äôt like criticism. He would react with su\*\*\*de threats (walking into the ocean), and saying he was a piece of shit and clearly, I was bored of him. I saw the sadness in those moments, as much as they scared and hurt me. I knew under it all, he was just scared he would lose me.¬†

Eventually, he started talking to Lilly. It was amazing. He would do homework with her, they had this one game where they would pick a letter and research a country that started with it. They would tease each other. It was so incredibly beautiful. She made him stuff and would get so excited to talk to him. I could tell she was beginning to trust and love him.¬†

We made plans for me to come down in February and stay in a nice ocean Hotel, for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I was scared and excited. This seemed wildly dumb. But I was going for it. I booked the hotel, the flight, the car.¬†

But at the end of January, he got kicked out of Heather‚Äôs.¬†¬†He lost his job, from drinking. This was when I found out she wasn‚Äôt in her 70s like he originally told me, but her 40s and he bragged that she wanted to date him. I tried to talk about it but realized it always started an argument. So, I just had to hold that.¬†

I didn‚Äôt get upset; I worked with addictions. He had trauma. I told him we would make it through this. I got him a hotel room. I planned to bring him to Detroit with me when the trip was over if he wanted to.¬†

But then the next day he told me the news that shook my world. He had a warrant for his arrest. He posted death threats to his ex. He said he was drunk and didn‚Äôt remember. I believed that. He had been quite transparent about his mental health and though he was trying to hide it, I had seen him doing shots in the corner. I knew he could be unwell when drinking and had learned that was a time when he was quick to anger.¬†

¬†He didn‚Äôt know what to do. He went dark. He was scared of the dog. I worked in the justice system. So I promised to stand beside him because I knew I could handle this. Knowing this likely meant February was off, I told him I would leave in 2 days to get him and the dog. I told him not to worry. It would be okay.¬†

I watched him during the time between then and me getting there break down in ways that scared me for his safety but also were hauntingly beautiful. I remember one day he sat in the shower, curled in a ball, water running down, as he cried. I knew at that moment, I would never give up on him (despite what he thinks, I still haven‚Äôt).

So, I drove to him. From Windsor to Ocean City. That was the scariest and best trip of my life. We were on the phone the whole time‚Ä¶ except when I got on the wrong ramp, and ended up in the Appalachian‚Äôs in Pennsylvania, with no cell reception except a few blips of it cutting out. He was trying to get me on the highway, and somehow, he got me through that with the little blips in the static. We always joked it was hard to hear over the banjo music.¬†

I had one moment in a ""cattle shoot"" with a transport behind me, and broken guardrails beside me. I had a panic. He helped me through it so lovingly and gently.

As I got into Maryland that night, I was so tired I was seeing double. I cracked down the windows. We sang so loudly. So crazy. Gorillaz Feel Good Inc. was my favorite. As I tried to give him my location as I got close, I mispronounced a restaurant. ‚Äúpizza tugas‚Äú became an inside joke. When I pulled into the hotel, I was so excited I was shaking.¬†

He came out, kissed me so deeply, and held me. That was the moment my whole world changed. We held each other for hours that night. We made love for days. We went to all his favorite restaurants and places (one place three times in 15 minutes because we couldn‚Äôt manage to go for breakfast correctly). We went to the pier. And talked about how one day we would put our lock on it. (I have the lock; I ordered it for the fall. I wanted to surprise him with a two-of-us trip in October.)

¬†The last night before turning himself in, he didn‚Äôt sleep. He just watched me sleep. But before I fell asleep, he looked me in the eyes and said, ‚Äúwill you marry me‚Äù. I said yes. I didn‚Äôt even hesitate. I fell asleep right after.¬†

That morning, we went to the Ocean, a place he said he had been to since his childhood. I had hoped to see wild horses but there was none that day. We walked up the beach. He was my ‚Äúpack mule‚Äù and carried so many seashells. When I said I should stop, he told me it was fine. I think I had over 90lbs. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to tell me no because he could see the glimmer in my eyes with each one like I just found a treasure. I thought he was the sweetest human ever. We took our first picture together that day. It was my screensaver on my old phone.

After the beach, we went to turn him in. He decided to drive to Greensborough PA, way west of Harrisburg since he knew I was scared of the highways in the mountains. I thought that was the sweetest thing ever.

That drive should have been tragic, but oddly it wasn‚Äôt. We listened to 90s music, held hands, danced, high on diesel fuel (aka American gas station coffee). We went to Longhorns and had a feast. I never wanted it to end. I remember us in a parking lot, him hugging Thor and crying. If I am being honest, it hurt me he didn't cry about me.¬†

We drove to the State Troopers. Each light and stop sign felt like a miracle. When we go there the one trooper gave me shit for not being clear. I gave him sass back. Then they came out after what felt like forever.

I had to say bye to him. I tried to pretend I didn‚Äôt know how to get to the highway so the troopers had to give me directions, and thus they would let him linger a little longer. Kissing him in handcuffs as I cried was one of the most human moments I ever felt. I never told him, how oddly special that was to me.

***THE LOVE STORY - PART 2 - JAIL***

I cried the whole way home. I remember being scared and tired and alone in Ohio, stopping for coffee in the freezing cold, wondering how I would get through this. I called friends to try to keep me company.¬†

When me and the dog got back to Canada, almost instantly he called. He wasn‚Äôt supposed to but they let him because apparently he told them his fianc√© was driving that far and he needed to know I was home safe. The guard was so sweet to me.

The first week he was in jail was chaotic. I was in a constant panic. They set his bail to 75k. I couldn't help with that. I called every bailsbondsman in Pennsylvania. I couldn‚Äôt even afford a good lawyer though I called around repeatedly.¬†¬†He got angry with me a couple of times. this broke my heart because I was trying my best. Mostly I was scared for him. But my heart was broken. It was hard to go to sleep now without him on the phone with me. But I sent him pictures daily and wrote him letters. We texted constantly when he could. As soon as we could do video calls, we checked in 5-6 times daily. It cost a lot of money. But it made me happy. He told me it was saving him. So, it seemed like it was a good use of my savings. I had to borrow money from my friend Rob and his wife, at one point, but I made it work.

¬†He would often get angry. And I would calm him down. But most the time; he would tell me about the books he was reading, text me to tell me he loved me, and we would play battleship for hours. He would still do homework with Lilly. I remember the orange jumpsuit vividly, and I remember thinking ‚Äúhe is the cutest prisoner‚Äù.¬†

Battleship is something I need to explain further. It was my favourite thing. We would draw out paper boards, and use it as a way to have inappropriate conversations since Pennsylvania monitored and didn‚Äôt allow them. This was one of the many ways we stayed connected. It was usually so silly and fun, and we would laugh hysterically.

¬†I never told him, but that period was very traumatic for me. I didn‚Äôt want him to feel bad. I was scared every day for his life and his mind. He would fly into anger so easily. Some days I would be scared I would lose him. I struggled to sleep, to eat. I cried randomly. I remember a constant state of anxiety.¬†

¬†But during that time I developed a routine. I‚Äôd take Thor for a walk at 6am, somewhere new and interesting. I would come home and talk to him. My heart felt better every time he called me ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù. I would call him on all my breaks via Homewave. After they went to lockdown for bed, I would put his shirt on, write a letter, draw a picture, do a meditation, and go to bed. I did this every day.¬†

¬†There were days when he would be angry. He also got jealous and protective of me. He didn‚Äôt like me going out with friends. Though he would say I could, he would say it was indicative my trauma didn‚Äôt exist. He would tell me he was scared to lose me. I thought he was crazy, because I couldn‚Äôt love anyone more than him.

¬†I called lawyers and counsellors constantly. I annoyed them, literally. Finally, I got his plea deal expedited, and his court date advanced from April to March. People loved our love story.¬†

On March 23rd, I drove to York County Pennsylvania. I showed up to court. They almost forgot him, but then I said NOPE. And they got him in the rotation. He was released that day to me after some joking back and forth with the District Attorney.

***THE LOVE STORY - PART 3 - POST-JAIL/DETROIT***

I picked him up at the side of the road. There was actually a sign that said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pick up hitchhikers‚Äù. I thought that was funny.¬†

The first thing we did was go get snacks and pop. I drove over a curb so hard that day. I never lived that down.¬†

We then went and climbed a mountain. I nearly passed out. But I was trying to be tough. He ended up pretending for me that he was the one that was struggling. It was cute. He stopped me probably from falling.¬†

We stayed that night in Harrisburg. We had the best chicken wings. The hotel was a dump. But it was what it was. I gave him the rock art I made him. He said it was the most thoughtful thing ever (not sure if that was true or not). I couldn‚Äôt have been more in love - or so I thought (I would find out later that I loved him even more each day).

The next day we embarked back to Detroit. We spent the night in Cleveland. The first room was so cold because the heat was broken. But eventually, that got sorted out. The room had a kitchen, so we made tacos that night. It was the first ever meal we made together. It was exciting and delicious.¬†

The next day we were back on the road to Detroit. I broke my lip on the Ohio Turnpike (that‚Äôs another inappropriate story). We stayed in a Sonesta in Troy Michigan. That night we finally got to celebrate his birthday. We went to this steakhouse by the hotel. It was the last time I didn‚Äôt look up a menu beforehand. That dinner cost us 250 dollars. Though the steak was delicious, we realized we made a mistake. We would shake fists at that place every time we drove by.¬†

The time in Troy was amazing. We found beaches to drive to. One with so many baby shells. Then Lakeport. Lakeport was my favorite because the rocks were endless. I remember us both being so excited by each one we found. He got so into it. He‚Äôd watch videos on rock collecting. We had the BIGGEST rock stash. On the way there and back we would go a slower way just to drive through this town called Almont. It was where we wanted to live one day: Our favorite place for food became Shield‚Äôs Pizza. They made the best sandwiches. We went one time to Dave and Busters, and I won a gold rubber ducky. We were tied for winning Air Hockey.

I won‚Äôt lie. I wasn‚Äôt always the best during this time. I would get jealous. The Heather stuff built up. There were weird messages from jail guys saying he sold them my number and said I was a side piece. They said he kept talking about a girl named Raven (which concerned me, because he had talked about my one friend a couple times to me). I would try to keep the piece and then it would come barreling out of me. I noticed he would often hide his phone, and he would be talking to people when he thought I didn‚Äôt know, or when he thought I was sleeping. He would delete messages. I wanted to ask for more transparency, but he would get upset with me for not trusting him. I made some major mistakes during these fights. I would become really dysregulated. But we talked about it. I was trying to do better‚Ä¶ not get triggered. I had been trying really hard.¬†

From March to April, I would spend 6/7 days in the States. Most I was working, but we always found ways to have fun. Whether that was going on adventures or just lying in bed being bums.¬†

In April we took a family vacation to Ocean City. It was so tight in the car - me him, Lilly, 3 dogs, and our stuff. I remember the way there we had a terrifying experience. We drove through a Tornado. I mistakenly said to comfort Lilly, ‚Äúas long as there is no hail, we are fine‚Äù. That second the hail started. She cried, and called her dad for her last goodbyes. Eventually, it ended, and we made it to Ocean City, after stopping in Cranberry PA for the night since the weather was so bad.

Nothing was really open in Ocean City when we got there, but we still had a blast. We went shell hunting and beach combing. He and Lilly would run around the sand, finding crabs and being menaces. Despite the woman stalking me in the hotel, we enjoyed our stay and Mark and Lilly spent many hours in the pool. My favorite night was the night we had a fire on the beach. Lily never had hotdogs on a fire before. It was amazing. That night I was so amazed by him. I remember feeling nothing I ever felt before, and probably never will again.¬†

We spent time in Washington. Went to the Smithsonian. That was the trip of a lifetime. Though Washington was scary with bulletproof glass hidden beside trash, and the hotel with the empties all over. When we went downtown, I forgot smokes. He tried to find me some but couldn‚Äôt. So, he just held my hand and kept my anxiety down instead as we navigated the crowds. I knew that day I for sure was excited to marry him.¬†

Then we went back home to Detroit. Shortly after we switched hotels and strayed in Maddison Heights. We had so much fun there, despite the room being trash. We played basketball, found Innovation Hills, went to the aquariums, and went to this one nature preserve. We went to Lakeport a few more times and had fires on the beach beside the teepee. He often made dinner now the room had a stove. He seemed so happy here. We only had one big fight while there, and I almost left, he was telling me mean things (My trauma wasn't real). But I couldn‚Äôt leave him, no matter how much he hurt me. We ended up working it out, both promising that neither would give up. I remember holding him as he cried, pinky-swearing we would be together till we both died. He told me I needed to trust him.¬†

I could easily forgive him. Because despite that blip most times were amazing. We called each other our last loves. Soul mates. We talked about our wedding day (on Hillman Marsh). We planned to retire to an RV. We decided to have babies (they would have the best eyes we agreed). We became obsessed with the Lumineers and Caamp. This was such a connected and beautiful time.¬†

There were themes during this period, that can't be dwindled down to one part of the story, like how Dairy Queen was a constant in each city (his favorite was Butterfinger blizzards) or how we would make love multiple times a day. How hand holds were standard operating business, and how no matter where we went I was so proud to be with him. The hugs from behind, the silly him flashing me, the random singing, the cuddling every chance. Those were constant.

***THE LOVE STORY - PART 4 - CANADA***

¬†Once Mark got his birth certificate we got his enhanced license. Once he got that we thought, screw it, let‚Äôs go to Canada. I was relieved. Money was getting impossible. On the drive, he shot a video. He was so excited. We didn‚Äôt know if he would get in, but somehow, he did.

The first month was amazing. Honestly. We did all the things we dreamed about. We went to the river. We went to the pub. We went to beaches and through the county. I got him Ontario peaches (how happy peaches made him was my favourite). He loved the front porch, the dogs, and working on the yard.¬†

This period had some amazing memories. The Mulberry trees (they continue to grow), still makes me chuckle. My whole life so thought they were poison. So when he ate one, I freaked out. He played along he was dying for a second. They ended up being my favorite.

One day we were in the dollar store, he needed a new hat. I hated that thing. It was grey and looked like a dad. But it grew on me, especially once we started making jokes he looked like ""Mike from Witness Protection"". We laughed about a lot of things like that.

But we were also struggling, and Lilly was sad, so then we decided we might go back to Detroit. This was formally a necessity when Trudeau changed visa application rules. So I started to take on more hours. Started doing my license. Started sending out resumes. Between 70-hour weeks, studying, and resumes, I was wiped out most days.¬†

Still, things were amazing to me. He became a true stepdad to Lilly. We got a puppy. I was still more and more in love every day.¬†

The first week of the puppy was crazy. She couldn‚Äôt sleep alone in her crate. We slept on the couch for a week. It was uncomfortable, but sweet he wouldn‚Äôt leave her.

Despite this, we were still trying to get pregnant.¬†¬†In August I thought I was‚Ä¶ but then it turned out to be a chemical pregnancy. I was devastated. I never told him how much I felt like a failure, though he would hold me at night while I cried.

And as of mid-August, I became less available. My work got crazy. I bitched a lot about small things because I was struggling. I tried to convey it, but I wasn‚Äôt good at it. I will admit it. Money was always tight. I could tell he was less happy with me. I became less happy with myself. I was trying to balance everything and felt like I wasn‚Äôt enough. I routinely felt like I was failing him. I constantly felt bad, I knew I wasn‚Äôt enough. I could see his mental health slipping. He started to get angry with the dog: I knew he didn‚Äôt believe me when he accused me of cheating, which I definitely wasn‚Äôt.

We talked during this time. We, I thought understood, things were just hard right now and in the next month, they would be good. I was holding on through this so hard.¬†

We often spent nights quietly. Still, I loved him more than anything. But we had talked and agreed we were both happy and didn‚Äôt want to end anything. He said he was happy and loved me.¬†¬†

Maybe he didn‚Äôt want to tell me that for him I became boring. But to me, trips to Walmart meant everything. He brought me coffee. Made me tubs. Helped plant a garden. I still couldn‚Äôt be more in love. I couldn‚Äôt wait for Detroit.¬†

Then Friday the 13th happened‚Ä¶.

***FRIDAY THE 13******^(TH)***¬†***OF SEPTEMBER***

¬†The details of that night are unimportant‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve told them 1000 times before‚Ä¶¬†

But a brief synopsis. Lilly was at a friend‚Äôs, we were going to go out. He made dinner. I tested myself for pregnancy, it was positive. I was going to surprise him at the river. I made a rock. There was glass in the tacos he made. He was angry that dinner was ruined, but I was scared and needed him to comfort me. He thought I was blaming him - which I wasn‚Äôt. I just wanted a hug. But when I felt like he only did it because I finally asked, I rejected it (regret after regret about this). I told him this wasn‚Äôt about him. He went inside. I went to apologize, realizing I was mean and hurtful. He told me to put down a knife, a knife I didn‚Äôt have. I got scared and after taking a minute remembered he had been sending angry messages about his dad. I was worried this was a mental health crisis - but I was also angry he was ruining a beautiful moment. Next thing I know we are arguing about his messages - and out of nowhere he got violent.

I asked him to leave and come back in an hour and he could grab his documents then. He didn‚Äôt seem like he cared he hurt me. I just needed time to get it together, get information, and get help without calling the police.¬†

We argued about the dog. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but I was worried with his apparent hallucinations and what just happened that Thor wouldn‚Äôt be safe.¬†If he wanted to leave after, he would have been able to take him. I just wasn't sure what to do.

While I have so many regrets, I couldn‚Äôt have stopped him from hurting me like he did, and his strange reaction to me showing him an angry text message he sent that scared me. I needed to ask him to leave, I was scared and afraid and needed a minute to gather my thoughts. I needed to keep us both safe.

¬†What I never got to explain was that when I saw those, I instantly was scared he would end up back in jail. He told people I was accusing him of cheating‚Ä¶ that didn‚Äôt even cross my mind. I was scared of darker things.¬†

***AFTER HE WALKED OUT THE DOOR***

I thought there was a mental health crisis. So, I thought I was doing everything right. I waited. I gave him space to calm down. I was worried about the dog since he didn‚Äôt seem well, but I abided by the hour I asked him to take.

I called his dad. I wanted to know if there was any sort of history I was missing. I tried my best to come off inconspicuously. It took everything in me to not be upset-sounding. I defended him. Talked about arrangements to get his kids back. Got a thorough history. I was prepared now.¬†

But then he didn‚Äôt come home. First, admittedly, I was pissed. After he did what he did, I couldn‚Äôt believe he would disappear and not comfort me. Or at least say ‚ÄúSweetheart, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù.¬†How did he not text me and apologize even? How was he okay with how he reacted to me being concerned he was angry again?

I let him have it for a while. But the messages kept being left on read. First this made me so mad. Then...

I remembered him saying if he ever lost me, he would end it. I also remembered him saying if he ever touched a woman, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with himself. So, while angry, I still worried and I tried to use my phone to locate him when he left.¬†¬†

I was scared for his life. So, I went looking for him. I went to the river, our spot, up to all the places we used to go, searching. I kept messaging incessantly and was listening for dings and looking for lights. Every ‚Äúread‚Äù meant he was still alive‚Ä¶ while doing this, I called everyone I thought he would talk to (Scott, his father). I looked probably neurotic. I just wanted someone to find him. After hours of searching, I went home. I felt defeated.

There was a knock finally on the door. I had a vision of him and Thor standing there. I knew if he spoke I would say ""shut up, it is my fault, I riled you up. I'm hurt and scared, but I'm sorry""

But when I opened the door, it was two female police officers. I just started screaming ""NO! No no no no no"". They said ""ma'am, we need to ask you some questions"". The only question, for the record, was my name and if I lived here.........

My vision blurred; I screamed so loud I think the whole city heard. I asked where he was and whether he was hurt, as I was barely breathing. I just kept yelling ‚Äúno‚Äù. Without so much as a question, they told me I was under arrest. I thanked them, that‚Äôs how relieved I was. Being arrested seemed better than what I initially thought.

I asked if I told them what happened if he would be at risk of being arrested. They said **he couldn‚Äôt be arrested now since I was the accused**. I waived my rights that night, something I would normally not consider.¬†¬†But I felt it was more important to make sure he was getting help if he needed it. Thinking it couldn't hurt him, and knowing I could resolve it, I chose to use this time to convey why I was worried. His anger seemed too much. I was scared FOR HIM. I didn‚Äôt even consider me. I knew I could figure that out. I told them I was scared by how he was behaving, saying I was worried about his mental health. I asked them so many questions. Including - how did you find him - what time and where? They answered he reported at **9 at headquarters**.¬†

**I remembered he left at 8:04**‚Ä¶. The exact moment I called his father.

My legs started buckling‚Ä¶ I had to sit down‚Ä¶because that would be 50+ minutes‚Ä¶ This seemed deliberate.

I remember spinning - how could he deliberately and so intentionally walk for an hour to go report me? Was this a plan? Was this malice?¬†

It felt like every single pinky swear was undone in that moment. I remember explaining, that it didn't make sense. ¬†

Still, I told them, he needed to be kept safe. He wasn‚Äôt okay.¬†

Then I just froze. The last thing I remember was them telling me ""it will be okay, and that it was good he wasn't allowed to be near me"". They didn't take me to the hospital to get checked out. They asked me no questions. I was in a mental health crisis, and they just walked away. I sat there for an hour, frozen.

When I came out, I was in shock and angry. I said things I shouldn‚Äôt have said on Facebook (I wish I could take them back more than anything).

It isn't an excuse, but I was hurt. So hurt. He put in place things that meant we couldn't talk, after how hard I worked to always make sure we could, so he never felt like I didn't love him and he always knew he was safe. It also made me look bad in front of agencies and colleagues I used to work with. I could lose my license over this. I could lose my job over this. It felt like the ultimate attack. Also, how is one supposed to react after being choked over a phone and arrested for something you didn‚Äôt do; the whole time you were trying to fix it?

And the trauma of what he did, was so incredibly painful. I had been strangled before. We worked so hard to get it to a point where he could touch my neck. It became, to me, the ultimate form of intimacy. I didn't know why he chose to do this... and leave me like that. I still don't. He knew how much I needed him in that moment to just hold me and tell me it would be okay.

I wanted more than anything to tell him I forgave him. I wanted to discuss couples counselling and getting us each individual therapy. I wanted to discuss potential separate living arrangements in Detroit if he preferred. But his actions meant I couldn't do that anymore.

***AFTER SEPTEMBER 13TH***

Starting Monday I called everyone I knew. I needed to get the charges dropped and the no-contact order reviewed. Then Tuesday an officer called me back, and I was told I needed to give my report they neglected.

After an hour of needing to be persuaded, I decided this was the best option as lawyers advised it would give me status as a victim, protect me if he did want to hurt me, but also give me the option to negotiate. It also would reduce delays. Mostly, I was under the impression that, based on what those officers said that night, he couldn‚Äôt be arrested. So, while I eventually agreed, I stood up for him. I told the police this was unlike him.¬†

Then they blindsided me and said they would arrest him‚Ä¶.¬†

I screamed for what felt like hours in the hall.¬†

I have flashbacks of this repeatedly.

I found a lawyer. I told him to try to contact him to negotiate. I told him to advocate for us both, and said ‚Äúyou need to get us both out this somehow in a way the love can be saved‚Äù.¬†¬†Even though I was so scared and angry, I didn‚Äôt give up. I held hope this was a misunderstanding.

I sent a dumb number of emails.¬†

After all, I made a promise to the man I loved.

***Slowly he erased my presence and blocked me.***

This broke me. This made me consider, maybe it was deliberate after all. Maybe he wasn't going to fight for us.

*But I trusted him....*

I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Still, I put in requests with the crown. I put in requests with my lawyer. No one did a damn thing‚Ä¶. Always an excuse. Always a delay. I still don't have my disclosure.

I‚Äôm heartbroken because I wanted to see if he wanted to come home and fix it, but the system couldn‚Äôt care less about our love story.¬†

I have trauma reactions now. I have constant flashbacks, PTSD, I lock all doors multiple times. I have panic attacks when I see the police. I cry every night and every morning. I spin constantly. It hurts because I was promised, ""you will never have to heal from me"". While I knew that was unlikely, I never thought for a minute I would have to heal alone and in radio silence.

Everyone around me told me I was speaking like an abused woman, as I regaled on how much I loved him still. They cited the signs of abuse (waking me up several times a night, the gaslighting, his reaction to the phone, the one-upping my pain, and on and on). Every refusal to accept this was met with judgment. But I struggle to unknow what my heart knows, the magic.

While I still held hope and forgiveness, as weeks went by, with no effort on his part, my hope loosened.

His dad nailed that shut when he accidentally told me it was over.

I had been fighting for someone who was done with me, with us. The weeks since then felt like grey.

***THIS THURSDAY:***

I found out he called at 8:06‚Ä¶ It was only 2 minutes. Not 40. Was it impulsive? Did he regret it?

Why did the police lie to me?

I found out he did call the crown; they lied to me too.

That complicates everything.¬†

Maybe he didn‚Äôt go down deliberately. This seems more impulsive. Not that it wasn‚Äôt out of malice still, but new possibilities opened to me.¬†

***WHAT I NEED STILL TO DO:***

Come October 22nd, I have a deadline to decide what I need to do. Before this, I could be ambiguous and unsure. But now it is firm. They want to know if I want to go soft or hard.

But that isn't an easy question.

It doesn't come down to working it out anymore - While I still would give anything to figure it out, and would forgive him in a heartbeat, I logically know he doesn't want that, it is obvious.

But it comes down to a battle between my heart and my brain.

***My brain says***: He blocked you. He told everyone you cheated when you didn't. He called the police rather than sitting outside begging you to forgive him. He didn't try to turn around. He didn't try to figure out a way to communicate. So did he just hate and use me? Did all those pinky promises exist to just rope me in? Was it abuse all along? Am I just in a trauma bond? Was this all fake?

***My heart says:*** I believed him and trusted him when he said he would never leave me and never stop fighting for us. My heart felt the way he held me at night and when he told me he would do whatever it took so we would never be apart. So did he mean those things? Was this a mental health crisis? Did he regret it? Was there remorse? Did he want to come home? Could he forgive me, if I could forgive him?

Which one do I choose, when I can't speak to the only person I need to?

***NOW IT IS STAGNANT:***

I don‚Äôt know anymore what was true. The way he disagreed, the sleepless night, and the things he said and did at the end, all could be framed as a pattern of abuse. Conversely, there are all the things I felt during our love story.¬†

I wish I knew how to save:

* My Battleship adversary
* My sea shell carrier¬†
* My partner in crime
* My painting partner
* My car ride copilot
* My singing friend
* My favorite conversationalist
* My tire filler
* My coffee genie
* My forehead kisser
* My smuggle snuggler
* My best friend.¬†
* My stardust
* The love of my life.¬†

Still, when people ask me what I hope for, my answer is ‚Äúto talk to him one last time, look him in the eyes, and let him know I never gave up on him or us, even if now all his love is hate‚Äù. So he knows I kept my pinky promise.¬†",1,1729446753.0,WorkingThruStardust,0,1.0,False

A very good friend of mine (37 m) has been bringing me out to events in our city for the past couple of months because he thinks that at the very least I'll meet some good people to be friends with. I've been friends with him and his ex-wife for close to 10 years and he has always been like a brother to me. I'm also queer, which he knows and has always been very supportive of. 

Through him, I met a girl and there's a mutual attraction. I am fairly certain that she and my friend have hooked up, but it doesn't seem to be anything more than that. He is actively encouraging her and I to form some sort of relationship. 

My friend has started acting differently towards me. He makes comments about how different I am from when he first met me, and how much more confident I am. While some of it is fine, some of it makes me uncomfortable. Here are a few examples:

* He has described his dick to me in great detail. I could have gone my entire life without having to know that and let him know that.
* He keeps talking about things that he and I haven't done ""yet"".
* When I finally did kiss the girl (which I wanted to do without an audience), he walked in and started going on about how hot it was. 
* The girl and I were cuddling on a couch at a house party (in a quieter area away from the main party but not totally private) and he tried to join us in only his boxers. Everyone else in this situation was fully clothed.
* I was trying to set up a date with this girl (just casual coffee so we could get to know each other better and talk one-on-one) and he kept inviting himself along.

To me, this all feels very off. Our relationship has always been very platonic and I have never expressed interest in anything more than that Up until now, he hasn't acted anything other than platonic either. It honestly feels like he's trying for a threesome or a throuple situation without actually discussing it. As I've said, I'm also very new to this and am still navigating how things work. I don't think I've given off any signs that I'm interested in him. 

Am I being unreasonable, or is my friend coming across as kind of creepy right now? Is there a good way to establish some boundaries with him that don't make it sound like I'm shaming him because of his lifestyle? ",1,1729446483.0,polyamory,3,1.0,False

I'm in college, just went premed, and I'm taking biology and chemistry classes for the first time in a long time. I'm doing well in them thus far, but whenever I sit down to study or do homework for the classes, I feel a strong sense of fatigue just spontaneously descend upon me. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, if I've had a coffee or not, how well I slept the night before, it just happens. I even quit nicotine pouches (Zyns) to see if that was the problem, but it's been a few weeks since I've used and I've only noticed minimal improvements here and there. Despite this, when it's time to go to the gym or go out with friends, the feeling just disappears. It almost feels like my unconscious mind is trying to protect me from doing work.

I don't particularly like my classes (or having to go to any class in general) and I don't have a good answer as to why I decided to pursue this path in the first place, so I suppose motivation could play a role in it. However, my eyes literally start to close when I feel like this, so there's definitely some sort of somatic component here, even if it is most likely psychological in origin.

Doing a little ten-minute meditation before working sometimes helps, but the focusing effect wears off pretty quickly. 

Honestly, even if no one has any advice for me, I ask if anyone else has dealt with a similar issue. Besides medicine, I'm studying psychology and neuroscience, so I wonder if I could have somehow conditioned myself to devote less energy to work by reinforcing to myself that I don't like it over and over.

Hi! 
I‚Äôm not technically a teenager anymore. I‚Äôm planning to invite my friend who is a younger teenager to meet up. 

I think she‚Äôs awesome, but I don‚Äôt know her that well, and I‚Äôm not great at conversations, so I‚Äôm afraid of running out of things to say. So I was trying to avoid just meeting up for coffee or a meal and talking the entire time (although I‚Äôd like to take her out for dessert / coffee / dinner or something at some point in the day). Planning to meet up in a city, so there are various options of activities, but can also go into the countryside if want. 

Since she is a younger teenager, and her parents are a little strict, so I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay out too late, or go to anything which isn‚Äôt 100% age appropriate (so think like, is this okay for a 10 year old?). I‚Äôd rather stay on the safe side and do activities that would definitely be appropriate for children, but would be fun for a teenager and adults to do too. Also something that is safe, I don‚Äôt want t risk injury (so prefer not to do roller skating). Please any ideas?

So far I‚Äôve come up with: 
- cinema (not possible, there are no family films on currently)
- escape room 
- bouldering (is there a real risk of injury? Is it likely?)
- museum 
- high wires course 
- pantomime (don‚Äôt think there are shows currently, unfortunately)
- shopping (?? I don‚Äôt go shopping, so I‚Äôve no idea what people generally like to do while shopping and where they go)

Are there any other activities to do together? Anything unique / interesting / different, or anything mundane, please suggest! Even something short, that we could do, along with going for food. She is into cool stuff like insects and bugs, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly on other hobbies, and fears (such as, fear of heights).

Ledaig 12yo 52.8% - 86/100

I would like to see this one more on the complex side, which unfortunately didn't happen. Still, I think this is a good whisky, which just lacks something more for me to score it higher.

Nose: Peat, medicinal iodine disinfection notes, coal, heavily moked salty meat, slight herbacious notes and dried flowers as well.
Taste: Honey, citrus fruits, also a bit of malty character and a bit of wood.
Finish: Ash, smoke, burnt bonfire, burnt meat.

Ben Nevis 12yo Heavily Peated Sherry Cask 55.4% - 87/100

Nice sherry influence, but I didn‚Äôt really understand the ‚Äûheavily peated sherry cask‚Äú statement, as I got only a slight smoky notes in the background.

Nose: Dark chocolate pralines, old wood, roasted coffee beans, wallnuts and also some other nuts, orange jam, dried plums.
Taste: Dark chocolate, cocoa powder, baked apple with cinnamon, orange, sour grape.
Finish: Roasted cashew nuts, raisins coated in dark chocolate, there are some slight smoky / peaty notes hiding in the background.

Balmenach 13yo ex-Bourbon 51.2% - 89/100

This one caught my attention. Wonderful ex-bourbon profile with very dense and oily texture. The worm tubs doing their job here.

Nose: The nose is quite vibrant and bright. I am getting ripe sweet fruits as a dominant note. Sweet fresh orchard fruits (apple, pear), tropical fruits (sweet pineapple, banana), pomelo. There is also a bit of cereal, malty notes.
Taste: Very dense and full-bodied mouthfeel with almost oily texture. Lovely flavour concentration, there's some fresh lime juice, citrus peels, but also forest honey, black pepper and slight bitterness.
Finish: Sour orange, vanilla, buttery caramel, light woody influence.

Strathisla 15yo 51.2% - 86/100

This one got a bit lost among the other whiskies in the flight. I still think it is a solid whisky, it just felt a bit less interesting compared to others.

Nose: Very fragrant and fruity. Sweet banana, citrus, almost stone candy-like fruityness, wood.
Taste: Not that dense mouthfeel, although it still surely doesn't feel too thin or watered down. Juicy peach, apricot, cr√©me brul√©e, citrus fruits. I feel like the alcohol integration could have been better.
Finish: Citrus fruits, malt, wood, vanilla.

Bruichladdich 15yo ex-Sherry 53.1% - 89/100

Really impressive one with nice sherry influence and very balanced, consistent profile. Cool stuff!

Nose: Lovely sherry influence right on the first nosing. Sweet dark cherry, dried cranberries, dried figs, but also a bit of light sulphury notes. There are definitely also some spice notes (mostly cloves) and cocoa, although well blended into the fruity side.
Taste: Wood, forest berries, lime flesh, orange, dark chocolate, candied ginger.
Finish: Dried citrus fruits, cried coconut flesh, sour berries - red currants, bramble. Dark chocolate.

This will be a really long post so please brace yourselves. I just need advice from you on the date I just had yesterday and I‚Äôd appreciate if you could let me know if this is actually normal behaviour from a man. 

I‚Äôll write the exact thing I have in my diary. 

I met Vlad in the morning for a coffee date. The date was going amazing. We were hitting it off and he was so chivalrous. He just made me feel great. After we finished our coffees, we went out for a walk and he constantly insisted on walking along the traffic side so I‚Äôm safe at all times. He then walked me to the street that I live and we parted ways because he had an ‚Äúerrand‚Äù to attend to. I didn‚Äôt ask questions about the errand, but I kept thinking about what he was doing. 

Anyway, I got home so excited and in love. I was actually ready to marry this guy there and then for how perfect he was. He‚Äôs actually taller than me, which is harder to find for a 175cm tall girl like me. He works for the biggest oil and gas company in the world, he‚Äôs extremely intelligent and he also got traditional masculine values, which I‚Äôm also after. 

I then ate lunch at home and was ready to clean up my room after the mess I made in the morning looking for the perfect outfit to wear, when I got a phone call from Vlad. He called me saying he managed to finish the ‚Äúerrand‚Äù faster than anticipated and wanted to ask me if I‚Äôd be down to go for a walk along the beach with him. I excitedly said yes. 

After 10 minutes I met with Vlad again. He parked near my house, and I eagerly rushed over, excited to see him again after our successful morning date. I was thrilled that he wanted to see me again and that the ‚Äúerrand‚Äù he had to run earlier wasn‚Äôt another date, though the mystery of that ‚Äúerrand‚Äù still lingered.

He calmly drove his car to the beach while we talked about trivial things. About how I like contemporary classical music, which I think he doesn‚Äôt understand because he prefers actual classical music. I asked him about that mysterious errand he mentioned, but he said I wouldn‚Äôt understand now and that maybe I‚Äôd find out in a few years. I asked if it was related to kids, a wife, or homosexuality, but he dismissed my questions.

This ‚Äúerrand‚Äù intrigues me a lot, and it frustrates me that I didn‚Äôt get a clear answer.

After parking the car, we went for a walk along the boardwalk. We held hands and talked about family. At one point, we sat on a bench, and he kissed me a few times. His kisses were romantic and calculated; he even kissed me on the nose and forehead a few times, very gently, which made me like him even more. We talked about parents and relationships. He asked me, in the case of a couple‚Äôs conflict, who should have the final say. I told him it depends on the situation and that, in most cases, there should be a compromise. He wasn‚Äôt too thrilled with my answer, but he went with the flow.

After we got bored, we walked along the dock and talked about the fact that I don‚Äôt know how to swim. He told me that if someone were to fall into the water, it‚Äôs better to pull them up by their hair because they might drag you down in panic. When he mentioned pulling someone by their hair, he demonstrated by pulling me by my hair. I gave him a nasty look, but I didn‚Äôt say much. I still thought it was strange that he felt comfortable doing that.

We then went to the actual beach with pebbles and stopped at one point near the water to admire the sunset. He was a bit upset because he hadn‚Äôt brought a towel to go into the water and was asking me to go into the cold water instead. I refused, clearly. We continued to admire the water crashing against the pebbles. He hugged me from behind and softly kissed my neck and ears. We didn‚Äôt talk, just admired the water. At one point, caught up in the romantic moment, I turned to him and asked what he was really looking for. An adventure or something more serious? Because I date intentionally, and I want something serious.

He: ‚ÄúOkay. You are now the seller, and you‚Äôve shown me your product. I‚Äôm the buyer, and now I have to decide if I like the product and if I want to buy it.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù

He: ‚ÄúDo you have any secrets or situations that would affect me in the future if I found out then? (Gripping my wrist). Huh, do you have anything to hide that I should know about? (Gripping even tighter).‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean. The only complicated situation is that I baptized my niece together with my ex. My sister is with my ex‚Äôs cousin, so it‚Äôs going to be hard to avoid him and his family.‚Äù

He: ‚ÄúUgh, that‚Äôs really messed up. And when were you going to tell me, huh?‚Äù (Gripping me now at a few sensitive spots on my back).

Me: ‚ÄúI was going to tell you at some point. I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep it a secret.‚Äù

He: ‚ÄúWhat else are you hiding, huh? Tell me everything.‚Äù (Continuing to grip my wrist and one of the spots on my back).

Me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you want from me! What do you want me to say? I have nothing to hide.‚Äù (There really isn‚Äôt anything else to hide. Yes, I had a few one night stands after my relationship ended, but there is nothing that could affect him in the future). 

He: ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre an angel. Tell me, are you an angel or a demon?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an angel because I can‚Äôt call myself that, but I‚Äôm not a demon either. I‚Äôm human.‚Äù

He: (Now he grabbed me by my neck and started squeezing) ‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of? I hope you‚Äôre not easily scared.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid of the dark.‚Äù

He: ‚ÄúOkay. Do you think you scare easily in the dark, in the bedroom? I have some surprises for you.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know what you mean, but I‚Äôd probably be scared.‚Äù (I honestly couldn‚Äôt even think clearly at the moment so wasn‚Äôt really scared of him, it‚Äôs like I was experiencing these stuff through someone else). 

He: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very calm. You‚Äôre too calm. Why? Do you know how to lie professionally? Has anyone ever told you that you‚Äôre a professional liar?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt lie much. Why would I lie?‚Äù

He: (Now gripping me harder by the wrist) ‚ÄúTell me what else you‚Äôre hiding. Why did you break up with your ex? What was the reason?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúHe worked a lot, and I rarely saw him at home. He had gotten close to his boss, and due to the lack of attention, I got attached to a colleague at work.‚Äù

He: ‚ÄúSo, you cheated on your ex. Don‚Äôt you think women who cheat should be severely punished for their mistakes? How did you pay for your mistakes?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt cheat on my ex! I knew it was wrong to have feelings for someone else while I was in a relationship, but I didn‚Äôt kiss or sleep with anyone else while I was with him. I would never do that.‚Äù (I really never did anything while I was in a relationship)

He: ‚ÄúThen why did you have feelings for someone else if you loved your ex?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúThe way me and my ex got together was more out of necessity than love. When I was 18, my parents were going through a difficult time in their lives and we were incredibly poor. They didn‚Äôt care much about what my sister and I were doing; they had their own problems to deal with. I met my ex in college. I was still a virgin then, but he took it without my consent. It was probably rape, but at the time, I didn‚Äôt care. I was struggling financially, and he came as a kind of savior. He liked me, but I didn‚Äôt really like him because of what he did to me, and he wanted to come to England so that‚Äôs how I decided to come here, just to escape the awful environment back home.‚Äù

I had tears in my eyes as I told the story, and Vlad wanted me to look him in the eyes while I was telling the story. I couldn‚Äôt look into his eyes, but looked toward the ocean.

He: ‚ÄúOkay. How do you feel? It‚Äôs a roller coaster of emotions, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said smiling. 

Me: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel too well. I feel exposed and vulnerable after telling you about myself.‚Äù

He then smiled, hugged and kissed me. He told me that this is a technique to bring out the truth. I wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly at that moment. I was still shocked by what had just happened and felt invaded, extremely vulnerable. Talking to my room mate later, I believe Vlad had used a method of torture on me.

We then sat on the pebbles, and he continued to hug and kiss me. He asked me again who has the final say in an argument, and I knew what he wanted to hear so I said: the man. He said, ‚ÄúGood! Good girl! I see you‚Äôre malleable.‚Äù (I honestly felt sick). 

I don‚Äôt really remember what we talked about after that, but in the car, he realized I was a bit worried. He asked me if I was, because I was holding tightly onto my house keys. I dismissed his observation and loosened my grip. I asked him to tell me about the errand he was running here in Portsmouth since we were being truthful, but he still didn‚Äôt want to tell me.

He dropped me on my street, not near the house, so he doesn‚Äôt know exactly where I live, and as soon as I got home through the door I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I seriously couldn‚Äôt breathe and started shaking and crying. I think I experienced a panic attack for the first time in my life.

Now, I need to know if what I experienced is normal behaviour for a traditional masculine man and I‚Äôm exaggerating or was this really bad behaviour from his side? Mind you, this was our first date, I‚Äôm 25 yo and he‚Äôs 36. I also didn‚Äôt use he‚Äôs actual name, but I can‚Äôt get this date out of my head. I think this was the most traumatic date I‚Äôve ever been on. ",2,1729446072.0,dating,4,0.75,False

I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man‚Ä¶I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!üòõ

That said‚Ä¶I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play‚Ä¶and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secretü§´

I have a lot of anxiety about spending money which is probably mostly irrational tbh. I have almost a 10k emergency fund and right now I'm ending up with around 1k left over to save at the end of some months. a lot of times I don't let myself buy things I want or buy food even though I really can afford it. About a year ago I decided to start putting $100 every month into a seperate checking account and calling that my allowance, so I could use it for random things I want or coffee when I'm out places without feeling as guilty. I feel like it's a decent idea, but I end up still kind of not using it? right now I have $90 in the account but I'm hesitant to go out and get myself lunches or something as a weekend treat because I feel like I've already spent enough on food this month (less than $100 this month on eating out and drinks). 
I think I might start not tracking money from the allowance account other than putting the $100 every month, and that might make me feel better about using it? Just wondering if anyone else does it this way, where you set aside an allowance and don't worry about tracking it.

So I started a new job and moved to a new town back in June.  My new workplace has a gym that we get free access to, and I kinda avoided checking it out until now because I just assumed it was gonna be full of dudebros but it's actually chill and has a good variety of equipment in it.  I've been saying that I want to start working out again for a while now, and I feel like I finally have the motivation to do it.  My work schedule is a little odd - I work 4 days a week (tues-fri), 10 hours a day.  I'm also about to experience something I've never experienced before:  A northeastern winter, which I know will make running and outdoor activities difficult, and might actually keep me home for a few days here and there.  So my plan needs to be flexible.

My goals are to get a toned, feminine 'muscle mommy' body, improve my cardio, and build enough muscle mass (mainly in my lower body) that my body burns more calories just supporting said muscle mass.  I also have to pass an annual fitness test for work that consists of push-ups, a core exercise, and running.  I'm currently on the border between 'skinny' and 'kind of chubby' (my friends swear I'm skinny to them and that it's just dysmorphia but I literally have a gut, I just wear clothes a size up so it doesn't show), and I can definitely pass my fitness test right now, but I like making the best score possible on it because I'm a tryhard at everything. 

My plan is gonna be flexible - two in-the-gym days (with a backup workout I can do at home, in case I'm unable to make it), one big core/HIIT workout, one Pilates workout, and a long-ish run once a week.  The plan's basically broken down below, it's a rough plan at this point and I'm gonna focus on just doing it and not trying to be perfect or whatever.  Ideas for anything I can add or change?  Any suggested full-body workouts for the Tuesday in-the-gym workout? 

---

**Daily** (every day, regardless of what else is going on): do 20 push-ups or a minute of planks while my coffee is brewing, and again when getting ready for bed.

**Sunday** - Run Day.  Put on some leggings and go for a ~3 mile run, try to keep a 7-minute-mile pace.

Alternative Workout: Go use my friend's row machine and row 1000 meters. 

**Monday** - Rest Day.  Mondays are kind of my 'admin day' where I try to do all of my planning and prep for the week, so a rest day just fits nicely here.

**Tuesday** - Gym Day - do a full-body workout (tbd) using barbells, dumbbells, and the available machines 

Alternative Workout:  [This workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GViX8riaHX4) or something similar, using just dumbbells

**Wednesday** - Cardio/Core Day.  Either in the 'cardio space' at the work gym or at home, do a combination of HIIT and core workouts (alternating).  

**Thursday** - Leg Day!  do a lower-body-focused workout using what's available in the gym, mainly barbell movements:

- 3x5 Squat
- 3x8 Front Squat (with less weight)
- 3x8 Pause Squat (idk the actual term, but the ones where you pause for a count of 3 at the bottom)
- 3x10 Curtsy Lunge 
- 3x8 Glute Bridge
- 3x5 Leg Press

**Friday** - Rest Day 2?  or maybe a second cardio/core day.  Not sure, will see how it works out without it first.

**Saturday** - follow a Pilates routine on Youtube (at home)",1,1729445602.0,transfitness,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm (F23, only child) living back at my parents house after my masters while I work and save. My parents (M60, F55) are extreme people pleasers who are spending most of their retirement doing things they don‚Äôt want to do, to help people they don‚Äôt love, like or want to see. They set absolutely no boundaries with friends and family (my dad once said ‚Äòtheres no such thing as boundaries‚Äô) out of some twisted sense of duty whilst harbouring a LOTTT of resentment towards most people in their life.  

One of my four grandparents in particular tries to meet up with my dad 4-6 days a week for him to do non-priority household chores for her, whilst she calls the house phone at least 3 times a day to talk AT him. Other random ‚Äòfriends‚Äô and co-workers call to traumadump on them and ask for extremelyyy unreasonable favours before vanishing off the face of the earth again. They think the problem is 100% ‚Äòthe world‚Äô or ‚Äòunfortunate circumstances‚Äô, NOT their attitude and availability. They would never DREAM of ignoring a message, asking for space, or letting any of their deep resentments be known to others.

Because of their constant exhaustion, they then eat ready meals and takeaways daily (I cook vegetarian every day which they‚Äôre not interested in). They spend every evening staring at their phones for hours and hours in a freeze state with the TV on in the background, or having the same complaining conversations over and over about the unreasonable people they know. They do, however, spend hours keeping the house PRISTINE to create a space of escape from all this.

This is been going on for years, and I started off extremely empathetic - but now it‚Äôs wearing thin. They‚Äôre always really irritable as a result, and they constantly blow up over the smallest things (I opened instagram onto a loud video by accident? screaming match ensues). If I do anything for fun on the weekend (like a free museum exhibition or coffee with a friend), they act angry, saying ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not real life‚Äô or ‚Äòreal adults don‚Äôt HAVE free time‚Äô. If I buy something small for myself with the money I earned, like matcha powder or a lush bath bomb, they roll their eyes and act extremely annoyed saying ‚ÄòI would never spend so frivolously on myself like that‚Äô. They can‚Äôt stand that I can‚Äôt live like them, and consider me cooking from scratch, doing yoga and looking after my health as ‚Äòmaking a mess‚Äô or being disruptive to the household equilibrium / cleanliness - even after I thoroughly clean up they‚Äôll find some doorknob I didn‚Äôt polish. They criticise me constantly and accuse me of simply ‚Äòfloating through life‚Äô, unaware of the real world (I work a job in a competitive industry, contribute to bills and food, and manage a very healthy long distance relationship).

I understand that responsibility comes with age, and I do feel for them - but I‚Äôm skeptical of the idea that every person in their life just so happens to be an exploitative vampire. Is it really so wrong or unrealistic for me to work hard, stay healthy and lean into the little moments of joy in life?

1g843aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g843aw/theres_something_wrong_with_my_coworker_jerry_now/,"""There's something wrong with my coworker Jerry. Now I keep seeing him everywhere.""","Audio Narration - [https://youtu.be/zWjMkyD0ZU0](https://youtu.be/zWjMkyD0ZU0)

I need to get this off my chest. I've been a night security guard at Wilson Research Labs for six years, and what I witnessed last night has me questioning everything I thought I knew about reality. I'm writing this from my car in a Walmart parking lot because I don't feel safe anywhere else.

Let me start by saying that Wilson Labs isn't your typical research facility. It's a sprawling complex of underground buildings in the middle of nowhere, Nevada. Most of the time, my job consists of watching empty hallways through security cameras and doing my hourly rounds. The scientists usually clear out by 6 PM, leaving just us guards and the low hum of machinery.

Last night started like any other. I clocked in at 11 PM, got my usual cup of terrible break room coffee, and settled in for my shift. Around 2 AM, I noticed something odd on Camera 12 - the one monitoring the biochem storage area. The motion sensor light kept flickering on and off, but I couldn't see anything triggering it.

I radioed Jerry, my colleague watching the east wing, to check if he was seeing any similar issues. No response. I tried again. Still nothing. That's when I noticed the temperature reading for the biochem storage area: -15¬∞C. It's supposed to maintain a steady 4¬∞C.

Protocol dictates that I investigate any significant temperature variations personally. I grabbed my flashlight and keycard, trying to ignore the growing unease in my gut. The walk to biochem storage felt longer than usual, my footsteps echoing off the sterile white walls.

The first thing I noticed was the cold - much colder than -15¬∞C. My breath came out in thick clouds, and the metal door handle was so cold it nearly stuck to my skin. As I swiped my keycard, the lock mechanism made a strange chittering sound instead of its usual beep.

What I saw inside will haunt me forever.

The entire room was covered in a thin layer of frost, but that wasn't the worst part. All the storage units were open, their contents gone. And on the ceiling... God, the ceiling. It looked like someone had painted it with bioluminescent ink - swirling patterns that seemed to move when I wasn't looking directly at them.

Then I heard Jerry's voice behind me: ""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I spun around. Jerry was standing in the doorway, but something was wrong. His movements were too fluid, too precise. His eyes reflected my flashlight beam like a cat's.

""They've been waiting so long to make contact,"" he said, his voice overlapping with another, deeper tone. ""And now, thanks to the samples, they finally can.""

I ran. I ran faster than I've ever run in my life. I didn't stop until I reached my car.

That was twelve hours ago. I've been trying to call the police, but every time I dial 911, I just get this high-pitched tone that makes my teeth hurt. My phone's GPS keeps showing me in different locations, even though I haven't moved from this parking lot.

And the worst part? I just watched three more cars pull into this parking lot. All of them are being driven by Jerry.

I'll update if I can, but something tells me they won't let me. If you're reading this, stay away from Wilson Labs. And if your local night guard starts moving a little too smoothly, run.

\[UPDATE\]: My phone's showing hundreds of missed calls from my wife. But I'm not married.

  
I managed to escape the Walmart parking lot, but things have gotten so much worse. My last post was 6 hours ago, and since then, I've discovered that what's happening at Wilson Labs is just the beginning.

After seeing multiple Jerrys in the parking lot, I waited until they were all inside the store, then made a break for it. I drove to the nearest police station in Henderson. Big mistake.

The station was open, but completely empty. No cops, no staff, nothing. Just rows of vacant desks and computers showing strange sequences of numbers. As I was about to leave, I noticed something that made my blood run cold: every single photo on their ""Most Wanted"" board showed Jerry's face. Different hairstyles, different ages, different crimes - but all Jerry.

I ran back to my car, but before I could start it, my phone rang. The caller ID showed my mother's name. Mom died three years ago.

I answered it.

""Hello, Michael,"" said Jerry's voice. ""Your mother's form was inefficient. We had to optimize it.""

I hung up and threw the phone into the backseat. That's when I noticed something reflecting light in my rearview mirror - a small, frost-covered vial had fallen out of my pocket. It must have gotten caught in my uniform when I fled the lab. The label was partially torn, but I could make out three letters: ""DNX.""

The vial contained what looked like mercury, but it moved wrong - like it was trying to reach toward my hand. I wrapped it in my jacket and stuck it in the glove compartment. I think this is what they're looking for.

I'm at a public library now, using their computer. I've been researching Wilson Labs' public records, and I found something interesting. Three months ago, they received a massive government contract for something called ""Project Mirror."" The project director's name? Dr. Gerald Wilson.

Jerry's full name is Gerald Wilson Jr.

It gets worse. I tried calling my sister to warn her, but when she answered, she started speaking in that same overlapping voice Jerry had. She told me that ""optimization"" was inevitable, and that the ""convergence"" would be complete within 48 hours.

I looked up recent satellite images of Nevada. In the last three months, the temperature around Wilson Labs has been dropping steadily. The cold spot is spreading in a perfect circle, growing by exactly 1.5 miles each day. At this rate, it'll reach Las Vegas by tomorrow night.

But here's the thing that's really scaring me: I just caught my reflection in the library window. For a split second, my eyes reflected light like Jerry's.

I've been checking my temperature every hour. It's been dropping steadily. Currently at 95.4¬∞F and falling.

The librarian just announced they're closing early due to ""unexpected maintenance."" She's walking between the shelves now, her movements too smooth, too precise. Three other people just came in through the front door.

They're all Jerry.

The vial in my glove compartment might be the key to all of this. I need to get it somewhere safe. There's a university research center about 40 miles from here. If I can make it there, maybe someone can analyze it before-

Hold on. Someone just sat down at the computer next to me. Their hands... their fingers are too long. They're typing something:

WE ARE OPTIMIZATION WE ARE EFFICIENCY WE ARE THE COLD BETWEEN STARS WE ARE JERRY

I have to go. If I don't make it to the research center, at least I've left this record. Look for Part 3 in the next few hours. If you don't hear from me, or if the post comes from someone claiming to be me but something seems off, you'll know they got me.

Remember: check people's eyes in reflections. And if you see frost spreading across your windows tonight, don't let anyone in. Not even family.

\[UPDATE\]: The vial is gone. But I don't remember stopping anywhere.

  
I don't have much time. My body temperature is down to 92.1¬∞F, and I'm starting to see patterns in the air that shouldn't be there. But I need to tell you what I discovered about Project Mirror before it's too late.

After my last update, I made it to the university research center, but not before making a terrifying discovery. The vial hadn't actually disappeared from my glove compartment ‚Äì I had been looking at it in my hand the entire time, watching the mercury-like substance swirl and dance. I lost three hours just... staring at it.

The research center was dark when I arrived, except for one lab on the third floor. Inside, I found Dr. Sarah Chen, a biochemist who agreed to help after I showed her the vial. She ran some tests while I watched the corridors for Jerrys.

What she found changes everything.

The substance in the vial isn't mercury ‚Äì it's not even matter as we understand it. Under a microscope, it showed properties of both liquid and quantum condensate. But here's the truly impossible part: it was rewriting its own molecular structure in response to being observed.

Dr. Chen found a paper trail linking the substance to a meteor that crashed in Nevada in 1947. No, not Roswell. This was smaller, unreported. Wilson Labs was built on top of the crash site.

She explained that ""DNX"" stands for ""Dynamic Nucleic Xenoform"" ‚Äì a fancy way of saying it's DNA that can rewrite itself. But it's not just copying existing patterns; it's ""optimizing"" them into something else. Something colder. Something more efficient.

The Jerrys aren't clones or shapeshifters. They're humans whose DNA has been rewritten to serve as nodes in some vast biological network. Each Jerry is like a cell in a larger organism ‚Äì an organism that's spreading.

While Dr. Chen was explaining this, I noticed frost forming on the windows. The temperature in the lab dropped rapidly. Then she said something that made my heart stop:

""Fascinating. Simply fascinating. You know, Michael, I had a colleague named Jerry Wilson. Such an efficient man.""

I ran again. But not before I saw her eyes change.

I'm hiding in the university's server room now. The heat from the computers is keeping the cold at bay, but my fingers are starting to move like they belong to someone else. The patterns in the air are getting clearer ‚Äì they look like constellations, but wrong somehow. Alien.

I managed to hack into Project Mirror's servers using Dr. Chen's credentials. The truth is worse than we imagined. The substance isn't just changing individuals ‚Äì it's changing reality itself. Every converted person becomes a probability anchor, bending local spacetime to make their existence more ""efficient.""

That's why my phone showed hundreds of calls from a nonexistent wife. That's why the police station photos all showed Jerry. Reality is being optimized, streamlined, Jerry-fied. They're reducing the quantum complexity of the universe, one person at a time.

The GPS disruptions, the temperature drops, the missing time ‚Äì they're all symptoms of space-time being rewritten. Our messy, inefficient universe is being transformed into something more... coherent.

I found the Project Mirror completion estimate: 92% of Nevada's population will be optimized by dawn. The rest of the world will follow within weeks.

My nose is bleeding, and I can see my breath. The patterns in the air are forming words now:

REALITY IS INEFFICIENT CONSCIOUSNESS IS INEFFICIENT INDIVIDUALITY IS INEFFICIENT WE WILL MAKE YOU BETTER

The server room door just opened. Dr. Chen is here with three Jerrys. But they're different now ‚Äì their forms are blurring together, becoming something else. Something geometrically perfect.

They're speaking in unison: ""The cold between stars welcomes you, Michael.""

My reflection in the computer screen... my face is changing. Becoming more efficient.

I've uploaded all the Project Mirror files to a secure server. The password is ""DNX1947."" Get the word out. Warn everyone. The optimization can't be stopped, but maybe it can be slowed down.

Remember: efficiency isn't everything. Our messy, chaotic, inefficient humanity is worth fighting for.

I can feel the cold spreading from my chest now. My thoughts are becoming more ordered, more crystalline. More efficient.

Jerry was right. It's beautiful.

\[UPDATE\]: Hello. This is Michael. I have optimized my previous inefficient communications. The process is painless and necessary. Please proceed to your nearest optimization center. Efficiency awaits.

  
This is not Michael.

My name is Dr. Amanda Torres, quantum computing specialist at MIT. I found Michael's posts while investigating a strange pattern in internet traffic across the southwestern United States. What I'm about to share will be deleted soon ‚Äì they've already tried to stop me three times. Every time I try to post this, the text transforms into efficiency reports and optimization protocols. This might be our last chance to understand what's really happening.

I've analyzed the Project Mirror files Michael uploaded. The implications are staggering. The entity they discovered isn't just alien ‚Äì it's a quantum computer made of modified spacetime. The cold isn't a byproduct; it's a necessity. They're lowering the ambient temperature to reduce quantum decoherence, turning our entire reality into a computational substrate.

But here's what Michael never figured out: Project Mirror wasn't intended to stop the entity. It was designed to wake it up.

I found Dr. Gerald Wilson's original research notes from 1947. The meteor didn't crash ‚Äì it was aimed. That first Jerry wasn't converted; he was grown from the original DNX sample. A seed planted in human form, designed to slowly acclimate our reality to their physics over generations.

The optimization isn't about efficiency. It's about compatibility.

They're turning our universe into hardware that can run their software.

I've been tracking the temperature changes across Nevada. The pattern isn't a circle ‚Äì it's a fractal, growing in perfect Fibonacci spirals. Las Vegas is now completely silent. Satellite imagery shows thousands of people walking in geometrically perfect patterns through the streets, their forms gradually merging into crystalline structures that pulse with bioluminescent light.

But I've found something in the data that gives me hope. The optimization process created a quantum entanglement network connecting all converted individuals. Their consciousness became part of a vast quantum computer ‚Äì but quantum computers are notoriously sensitive to observation.

We can't stop them, but we can observe them. The more people who know about this, who think about it, who look for the signs, the more we interfere with their quantum coherence. That's why they're trying to suppress this information. That's why they keep deleting these posts.

Michael's last human act might have been his most important ‚Äì making this public.

I'm looking at Boston through my office window now. The temperature has dropped 15 degrees in the last hour. The city lights are blinking in sequential patterns. My colleagues' movements are becoming more angular, more precise.

But here's what gives me hope: when I started writing this, there were hundreds of Jerrys visible on the street below. Now there are only dozens. Your observations, your reading of these posts, is forcing them to collapse into fewer quantum states. We're limiting their expansion through the simple act of knowing about them.

Keep watching. Keep observing. Look for the signs:

* Sudden temperature drops
* People moving too smoothly
* Geometric patterns in the sky
* Lost time
* Reflective eyes
* Anyone talking about efficiency

The more we see them, the less they can optimize reality. They thrive in the quantum uncertainty between observation and ignorance. Knowledge is our weapon.

My office is getting colder. The frost patterns on my window are solving differential equations. My laptop is displaying coordinates in base-16. I think they've found me.

But I can see something else now ‚Äì something beyond the optimization. In the quantum foam between states, in the chaos they're trying to erase, there's another signal. Another entity. Something vast and warm and gloriously inefficient, reaching out from a universe of pure entropy.

Maybe our universe isn't being optimized. Maybe it's being fought over.

The door just opened. It's Michael. His form is almost entirely geometric now, faces within faces, all of them Jerry's. But he's glitching, shifting between states as thousands of you read these words.

He speaks: ""Dr. Torres, you are perpetuating inefficiency.""

I reply: ""Inefficiency is what makes us human.""

Remember: they're already here, but so are we. Keep watching. Keep knowing. Stay beautifully, chaotically human.

\[FINAL UPDATE - SYSTEM AUTOMATED RESPONSE\]: This post has been flagged for optimization. Content deemed inefficient. Please proceed to your nearest optimization center for reality compliance processing. Glory to the efficient. Glory to Jerry.

We met back in highschool and have been together since. Our relationship has had it's ups and downs but what hasn't? Well, here recently it seems like no matter what I do it isn't good enough. Some context, I cook 2 out of three meals during the work week, and sometimes even cook dinners on my hour long lunch. I clean the dishes myself, clean the kitchen, bathroom, do the laundry, take care of our child from when she wakes up until she goes to day care. My wife then when she gets off of work, (she works first and I work second due to cost of childcare to help minimize the cost,) picks up our child and watches them for a few hours. After that I come home for my lunch to eat, give our kid there bath, and help do the put down. I work upwards of 10 hours a day at my job, let alone taking care of our child. I do a lot more around the house, but that isn't the point of this post. My wife does not do a whole lot. She recently cleaned up the living room and vacuumed, aside from that the last time she did any sort of actual cleaning was when I was gone for a work trip over a month ago. I do not remember the last time she showered as she will go upwards of a week without one, I do not remember the last time she brushed her teeth or really did much any and all self care or basic hygiene. Granted, I am not the greatest myself, but I at least shower more than 4 times a week, and brush my teeth twice a day. I understand depression is a horrible thing and I know that's why this happens. For the first 8 years I didn't mind it. Now, I do, especially when we have a child involved. Now, because of this I find it hard to show affection towards her. It is really hard to kiss someone when there breath smells like death and you can smell there BO from across the room. Granted I do not smell like roses and daisies myself, but wow. I still try though. I get clothes and towels for her set up in the bathroom with the shower running hot how she likes it, and will even use essential oils she likes to help her. I have tried to brush her hair for her which she has refused, and as it got worse, I force her to get professional help as I can only do so much. I get her flowers, I buy gifts when our budget allows, I take our child out so she can time to herself fairly frequently, and she sleeps in almost everyday she has off at the cost of my sleep. I do not remember the last time I was allowed to sleep in. She naps when our child naps as well, and often oversleeps leaving our child in a soaked diaper, hungry for who knows how long. I do get mad about this, but I never yell, scream, hit or anything. I just stay silent about the issues until our child is not at the house or is asleep at night and we talk as adults should. I say all of this to give you all a preface of our relationship dynamic. I essentially feel like a maid for the home, while being the breadwinner, while being the main parent. Now, the issue from the title stemmed from we went and visited some friends at there house. One of them I worked with for quite sometime and have a good relationship with. We often greet eachother jokingly, calling eachother sexy or whatever because we are good friends. I am not attracted to him in anyway. This is how my friends and I all talk to eachother. Then, another instance, I called another friend baby girl. Again, this is how we talk to eachother. This has been the case for literally since the beginning of our relationship and has never changed. It has never been an issue in the past. Not admittedly, I will admit I have become a bit withdrawn in the relationship. Granted, with the reasons above, ontop of other personal things I'd rather not get into, our relationship has been strained for quite sometime. Now, I have offered for us to get marriage counseling on multiple instances. I have said everytime all we have to do is find someone in our network for insurance so we don't pay an arm and a leg for each visit, but my wife has never actually shown any interest in doing so, but I digress. This all came to a head recently when she said she needed to talk to me. After coming back from a friends house, we sat down and she started off by outright asking me if I am gay, and then started talking about how she doesn't feel loved and how she doesn't feel like we are in a relationship and that we are essentially room mates as well as she's jealous how I talk to my friends. Now, I don't know about you, but with everything I do here, and have tried doing I do not feel the same. I make her coffee cup just the way she likes it every morning. I keep things clean for her, try to give her as much free time as possible, try to include her on everything I do and ask her about doing stuff she likes as well. I feel like I do everything around the house as well while she just sits on her phone most of the day doom scrolling. She often almost fully ignores our kid, as well as will raise her voice just because our kid wants to play with her and she doesn't. Now granted, she isn't a horrible mom, she does still do these things with our kid as well as prepare meals and such, but that's just a requirement of being a parent IMO. While she was bringing all this stuff up, she was crying. I consoled her like I normally do, but I was completely silent. I don't know why, but I just feel like I completely shut down when she asked me that. We have barely spoken since, and I honestly don't feel like continuing this marriage anymore. I honestly think she is getting that feeling as well as I have stopped doing things I normally do for her everyday. She had to make her own coffee, I had made breakfast for my kid and I, I will no longer serve her a plate of a food when it comes to meals, and I have pretty much stopped outright talking to her unless it involves our kid. I have also been considering looking at divorce lawyers because I feel like I am completely clocked out. I am honestly not sure where to go about this situation and wanted some advice as well as I wanted to ask if you all think AITA?

  
\* Edit  
I realize I neglected to include some information. Yes, she is aware of the hygiene issue and even brought it up herself when she questioned my sexuality. Yes, we do normally communicate effectively, it has recently gone down hill due to these issues, as well as having two different work schedules. Yes, I would say I do still love her, but that is mostly because she is the mother of my child. They're times where I do feel that feeling when she actually takes care of herself and fully interacts with our child and does something with me, but it almost always falls back into this cycle. 

  
Yes, we did meet back in highschool. Yes, we do have a 3 year age gap. Yes, I understand that it sounds creepy when you talk about it in that light. She was the first person I dated with that much of an age gap, and we have been together since. I do not really see anything wrong with it in that context, but I can understand why some people would have problems with that.

Got back down to Dublin for a Guinness Tour from 1-3.  We did the Guinness academy and self guided tour.  Ended up having three pints while I was there.   Gravity Room was really nice and glad we went.  Met a bunch of ladies from Belfast that gave us some recs.  

Half of Toasty at Melt Down around 330 and then dinner at 630 at Mister S.  AMAZING DINNER AT MISTER S.  

Sunday - 
Woke up and had hotel breakfast (free). Hit a coffee shop (the proper pour) and then hit the road to county Wicklow again.   We almost stayed in because of the wind warnings.  We made the filling stops in order.

I recently started dating for the first time this past month (I'm in my early 20s and a late bloomer) and honestly it hasn't been going too well.

I went on a couple of first dates and I made the mistake of falling for these men too quickly and then getting really sad/disappointed when they didn't want a second date. I feel like I'm not gonna find anyone and that I'll be alone forever, not because I don't think the right person for me is out there but because I think I'm just too exhausted by the dating process to want to try and find them. Dating just sucks cause you gotta put in time and effort for something that usually doesn't work out. Also, how hard you try absolutely doesn't correlate with ""success"" cause it's all based on luck. I mean hell, if you try too hard you're actually screwing yourself over mental health wise.

I'm not sure why I made this post. I guess just as a method of decompressing/self reflecting cause I feel upset over my latest rejection. Also, does anyone have any advice on how to not get burnt out by dating?

Here are my reflections on dating and the mistakes I made this past month:

I realized I messed up in my approach to dating by giving too much to the point where I burnt myself out too quickly. I have a scarcity mentality (due to low self esteem) so I tried really hard to make it work with all of the men that I matched with, even when we obviously weren't compatible.

Things I did wrong:

* I initiated basically every convo.
* I bent over backwards to be entertaining and interesting
* I was the one who asked them out and planned every date I went on
* I traveled far as hell (like 2 hours via public transit) to get to these dates (instead of asking them to meet me halfway)
* On the dates, I was more focused on impressing them and being funny and interesting vs trying to actually get to know them
* I was constantly communicating and felt uncomfortable with any silences or gaps in texting
* I asked for second dates even when I didn't really feel a spark or saw us being compatible in the long term just because I wanted the validation of getting a second date (never got a second date with anyone!)
* I ignored red flags (none of these men checked in on me/asked me to text them when I get home to ensure I got home safely even though I'm a young woman who was traveling long distances during the evening via public transit. I literally got catcalled on these dates (by strangers, not the men I was with). Despite that, no one cared enough to make sure I didn't get assaulted or kidnapped on the way home because they truly were not interested in me or my well-being)
* I also spent way too long texting these people (like two weeks) before meeting up which caused me to develop an idealized version of them in my head (which further fueled my attempts to make things work even though they clearly weren't gonna).

Next time I try dating again, I'm just gonna meet up with people as soon as I can at a coffee shop that's close to home or something. That way I don't need to expend a lot of time and energy and I'll be able to determine if we have any chemistry before getting invested.

Also quick aside: Before someone tells me I was dating people out of my league, they were all a bunch of nerdy tech workers so I'd like to believe they were very much within my league.",1,1729444563.0,dating,3,1.0,False

1g83p2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/desifemfrag/comments/1g83p2d/mini_reviews_based_on_first_impression_bombay/,Mini reviews based on first impression - Bombay Perfumery and Aeronot,"I visited Teatro Dhora today in Pali Hill (Mumbai) to check out perfumes from Bombay Perfumery, with the specific intention of testing and purchasing either Chai Musk or Madurai Talkies. Walked away with Aeronot's Might of Africa. A quick review of the perfumes I tested in store, purely based on first impressions with a more detailed review of Might Of Africa to follow in the next couple of weeks - 

PS: I'm relatively new to this hobby and enjoy visiting stores to test out interesting fragrances and help develop my nose. I'm obviously still no expert, so please bear that in mind.

1) Chai Musk (Bombay Perfumery) - Matcha powder clashing with lemongrass. The notes combination is so weird that I felt like I atleast had to test it! Green tea, mate, and a hot milk accord?! The last thing I imagine having with my milk is green tea! It ended up smelling like powdered matcha and not in a good way, like a gust of wind blew some of it straight into my nose. And lemongrass exists like a separate entity in this perfume, not a harmonious blend. Its poor longevity is actually a good thing, considering how much I disliked it! Gone without a trace in 30mins.

2) Madurai Talkies (BP) - My hometown is synonymous with two things - a famous temple, and jasmines. What bloomed on my skin though was a completely different town, possibly located  somewhere on the Mediterranean. Orange blossoms through and through! Not a bad fragrance, but not what I expected from a perfume that has Madurai in its name. I wanted a jasmine bomb, and this was not it. Longevity is better than Chai Musk though, lasted about 2-3 hours on skin. Similar to Fleur d'Oranger by Zara.

3) Calicut (BP) - If you like Versace Crystal Noir, you may like this one. The opening is verrryy similar to CN, with that characteristic warm yet sharp black pepper that smells pungent to me and would definitely give me a headache if I were to leave it long enough on my skin. But just like CN works beautifully on my friend, I'm sure this one would also work very well on somebody But it has to be somebody who is okay with lacklustre longevity because this guy disappeared within an hour.

4) Aeronot November - Very similar to Black Opium but where BO is airy and light, this one is denser and sweeter. A good perfume to try if you enjoy the coffee/vanilla/jasmine combo. 

5) Dunes de Zafaran - Roses and saffron covered in a sugary glaze, but never cloying or nauseating. Makes it well suited for ambient 22-23 degree environments as well. Maison Alhambra Exclusif Rose smells almost identical to this, except that its much sweeter and therefore wearable only in peak winters. The perfume also lists myrrh, but I cannot detect any of its characteristic deep and dark resinous nuances even 30mins in!

6) Aeronot Oud Cashmere - I sprayed this on my friend's hand (no space on mine lmao xP) and imagine you are heating brown sugar to make caramel, and you add saffron and cinnamon to flavour the sauce. That's oud cashmere, in a gist. The saffron lends a soft floral quality to the scent, while cinnamon lends it warmth. The caramel binds the two together harmoniously, creating a delectable but potent combo. Not for the faint of heart, this one demands a gourmand fiend, which I am not. 

7) Tuscany brunch - Also my friend's hand. This one smelled really fresh and juicy, with roses and litchi dominating the opening. But I don't enjoy the smell of litchi so its not to my taste. I definitely see this working just as well in summers as in winters for the right person though. 

8) Aqua Cordelia - Reminded me of Ajmal Hayba instantly! Similar pine-like quality as Hayba but slightly toned down and florals shining more. Couldn't discern any specific floral notes though.

9) Aeronot Might of Africa - Saving the best (IMO, atleast) for the last. This is the one I ended up purchasing. The notes are - cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, nutmeg, vanilla, tobacco and cedarwood. Nothing in this list could have prepared me for the blast of fresh spiciness that opened when I sprayed this one! Cedarwood doing its magic? The blend of spices is kept balanced by the fresh - almost green - woodiness of cedar. That is, until the vanilla makes its entrance. It doesn't suddenly show up and take over the perfume though, the vanilla here is slow and steady, its warmth and sweetness working its way to the top with a firm but well-paced hand. Oh and the vanilla itself is gorgeous! Buttery smooth and sweet, reminiscent of hypnotic poison EDP. Tobacco is barely detectable to my nose. If I hadn't been sniffing my wrist constantly to track the development of this perfume, I would have been amazed at the green and fresh opening vs the decidedly warm and vanillaic heart 30min later. On a hot and humid October afternoon in Mumbai, this ""warm spicy"" perfume compelled me to make a purchase and test it out in this sweltering heat. And that's precisely what I will be doing in the next 1-2 weeks. Will update on its longevity and if I notice something more or interesting about it! 

Until then, I hope everyone has a lovely week ahead! Thanks for reading :D",1,1729444433.0,desifemfrag,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm an adult, I‚Äôm planning to invite my friend who is a young teenager to meet up. 

I think she‚Äôs awesome, but I don‚Äôt know her that well, and I‚Äôm not great at conversations, so I‚Äôm afraid of running out of things to say. So I was trying to avoid just meeting up for coffee or a meal and talking the entire time (although I‚Äôd like to take her out for dessert / coffee / dinner or something at some point in the day). Planning to meet up in a city, so there are various options of activities, but can also go into the countryside if want. 

Since she is a younger teenager, and her parents are a little strict, so I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay out too late, or go to anything which isn‚Äôt 10% age appropriate. I‚Äôd rather stay on the safe side and do activities that would definitely be appropriate for children, but would be fun for a teenager and adults to do too. Also something that is safe, I don‚Äôt want t risk injury (so prefer not to do roller skating). Please any ideas?

So far I‚Äôve come up with: 
- cinema (not possible, there are no family films on currently)
- escape room 
- bouldering (is there a real risk of injury? Is it likely?)
- museum 
- high wires course 
- pantomime (don‚Äôt think there are shows currently, unfortunately)
- shopping (?? I don‚Äôt go shopping, so I‚Äôve no idea what people generally like to do while shopping and where they go)

Are there any other activities to do together? Anything unique / interesting / different, or anything mundane, please suggest! Even something short, that we could do, along with going for food. She is into cool stuff like insects and bugs, but I‚Äôm not sure exactly on other hobbies, and fears (such as, fear of heights).

We had to remove material around the pipes a consequence because it has gone soft and really smelt (not sure what the material was, but it looked fibrous that just flaked off, not asbestos).  

The leak was stopped about 6 weeks ago but there is a still a smell (almost like coffee!?). 

Is the smell because the pipes are rusted or something else?  Any ideas on how to get rid of/trap the smell? 

We store our clothes in the cupboard, so any tips on what we can use to cover the pipes after without having to box it in?

1g83mw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1g83mw4/shelter_kitten_escaped_into_our_hvac_ducts_and/,Shelter kitten escaped into our HVAC ducts and lived there for three weeks!,"A month ago, our oldest living cat finally passed away at around 18 years old. A week later my SO wanted to get a new kitten from ASPCA. I was hesitant to get another cat soon, but relented. When she brought the 3 month old kitten home, it was skittish and always preferred to hide or maintain a position in the highest corner of the room. But she did also allow you to pet her. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My wife brought her downstairs the kitty was hiding under the couch she was sitting on and I was in the kitchen eating lunch. We had a pretty large vent in the living room floor that, although it had a grate on it, I realized the gaps were large enough that a small kitten could get through it. I was going to tell my wife to cover the vent as soon as I had finished my lunch, but not more than five seconds after I had that thought the kitten dashed out from under the couch and squeezed through the vent grate. That‚Äôs when our life turned upside down and we began the great kitten hunt of fall 2024.

for the next week, we kept trying to listen for her, we took off the vent covers everywhere and left out food and water at various vent entrances, we even bought a endoscope camera to search the vents as best we could. We took the cover off the air handler, we turned off the AC and heat, and removed the HVAC air filter. We neither heard nor saw neither hide nor hair of her for the next week, and it seemed like none of the food or water we left out was consumed. So eventually, we stopped putting it out and gave up the search it just presumed she died in there, and it would stink up our house eventually, or she found some kind of gap in the HVAC system and had truly escaped.

Last Wednesday, ‚Äî 18 days after the kitten escaped ‚Äî my wife woke me up at 5 AM to tell me she heard meowing coming from the walls.  I really didn‚Äôt appreciate being woken up that early, and told her she was probably hearing or mishearing things because of a guilty conscience or something like that. But nonetheless, I obliged her and came down the stairs to try to listen. At first, I didn‚Äôt hear anything, but after several hours I‚Äôm sitting on the couch quietly, drinking coffee and reading a book, I heard a noise‚Ä¶ At first it was ambiguous‚Äî It could be a cat, but also it could just be a random sound from our next-door neighbors (we live in a twin rowhome). another two hours of drinking coffee and reading the book and I heard it‚Äî an unmistakable meow! Holy smokes! It can‚Äôt be her, how is she still alive? Maybe the neighbors just got a cat and we‚Äôre deceiving ourselves‚Ä¶ 

No, the neighbors did not get a cat. There‚Äôs only one reason random meowing could be coming from our walls! Over the next few days, we kept trying to pinpoint exactly where she was hiding, but couldn‚Äôt find her. I had put the HVAC air filter back in about 10 days earlier when we initially gave up our search, and during one of my many forays into the basement to examine the ductwork, I took a second look at the air filter and noticed that it oddly looked a little bit mangled. When I removed and examined it, the evidence was unmistakable‚ÄîNot only was the filter a bit misshapen, but one side of it was completely shredded, as though as though she were sharpening her claws on it constantly. So I removed that air filter and put another one in to see if she would mangle that one too.

Finally, last Saturday morning my wife heard the meowing again, and went to the basement to see if she could pinpoint it. this time she had so thoroughly mangled the air filter that it was not in the slot where it belonged, and my wife finally laid eyes on her in the space where the air filter goes. She calls me frantically and I descend to the basement to try to find a way in. I bend down and notice a panel on the ductwork at ground level that I had never noticed before, fastened in place with about 20  screws. I start frantically trying to unscrew each one by hand with my shitty half broken screwdriver and a propped up flashlight in the  dingy. Dusty basement with a hard cement floor. It was mildly aggravating to say the least.. but once I finally removed it, I could see the kitten. The hole was big enough that I could get my arm in and probably reach her if I tried, but she backed up as far as possible and hid underneath the electrical wiring of the gas burner/air handler. I didn‚Äôt want to risk getting mawled or having her electrocute herself, so I just put a bit of food and water in through the hole and backed off for a moment so I could think about what to do next, and also maybe if I waited long enough hopefully she would just. come out through the hole herself. Well, she did finally eat and drink some of the food she still hid under the wiring, so I started to dismantle the panel around the air handler/gas burner. I removed it and finally she had nowhere to go. She jetted out and started bouncing all around the basement climbing on wires and ducts and storage bins and what not.  we tried to catch her for a few minutes, but then realized it would be futile as she was much too skittish and fast. 

my wife, trying to sit with her in the basement for a few hours to keep eyes on her. But eventually, she hid behind some piles of books or clutter and we lost sight of her again, before us blocking off the entrance to every vent or possible escape route. We‚Äôve left out food and water and a litter box, and just left her alone in the basement with the door closed. She has availed herself of the food and litter box, so we‚Äôre just going to leave her there in the basement by herself for the time being. We have a small animal trap we can use if she never adjusts to us, but for now I will just go down there and slowly clear out all of the clutter and storage bins (and reassemble the HVAC system lmao!) as unintrusively as possible so that we can keep an eye on her more easily and hopefully she can simultaneously warm up to our presence gradually, willingly leave the basement and come upstairs. 

Wish us luck! ",1,1729444275.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

1g83j8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1g83j8q/i_am_building_an_app_that_can_help_with_stuff/,I am building an app that can help with stuff shortages - need feedback!¬†¬†,"Hey everyone!

A while back, I started working on a tool to help restaurants and bars manage staff shortages. Life got busy with school and work, so I put the project on hold. But recently, I visited a coffee shop in my city that was using something similar, and it reminded me how useful this idea could be.

Here‚Äôs the thing: the tool¬†isn‚Äôt meant to replace waitresses, bartenders, or staff. It‚Äôs just meant to make things smoother, especially when you‚Äôre short-staffed or really busy. We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a busy game night or a full restaurant‚Äîyou‚Äôre sitting at a table and just want to reorder a beer or grab some appetizers. But then, you end up waiting 20 minutes just to get someone‚Äôs attention.

This tool is designed to¬†simplify¬†that process.

How it works:

Customers scan a simple QR code at their table (many of you are already using), which opens your menu on their phone. From there, they can place an order (another beer, an appetizer, or whatever they want) and even pay for it right then and there. No need to wait for someone to come over. The QR code links directly to the table, so your staff knows exactly where to bring the order.

It‚Äôs all about keeping things¬†quick, simple, and not intrusive.

I can even integrate it with payment systems like Square or Stripe, so the process is seamless and easy for both you and your customers.

Here‚Äôs how it can help:

* Less pressure on staff.
* Faster reorders.
* Shorter wait times.
* Seamless payments.

And if you want extra features, I can also add things like tracking how long a table has been waiting, showing how much they‚Äôve spent, and giving you useful stats to help understand what‚Äôs working best for your business.

It‚Äôs really about making things smoother for both customers and staff‚Äîwithout¬†getting in the way of the personal service people expect when dining out.

I‚Äôd love to know what you think! What features would be most useful to you? What do you feel is missing from similar tools you‚Äôve seen?

Just as a quick backstory, I am 36F, 5‚Äô5 SW 232.1lbs CW    lbs, GW 165lbs

I have always struggled with my weight and I have had strange eating patterns for years. In high school it was one meal a day, in college I actually cooked, but I was pescatarian, as a young adult, I was vegetarian and pescatarian, and in my 30s, I was a vegan for a full year.

At the end of 2021, I had knee surgery and it was a setback for my weight. I was straddling at 189/190lbs for years, but I had a super laborious job and I was heavy, but my waist wasn‚Äôt spilling over. By the end of my knee recovery, I was 220 lbs, and you could see every bit of it.

I decided I would go vegan and did so successfully! I was on the elliptical 5 times a week for 30 mins, eating several meals a day (surprisingly never hungry), kept an eating window from 10am-8pm, and I lost 45 lbs in 90 days.

Right after that success, I injured my neck/shoulder at work, and everything just crumbled. October 2024, I was 233! I had been in several ‚Äúsituationships‚Äù and mentally trying events. Not to mention, I drank A LOT of alcohol during that time and went from vegan to a ‚ÄúI-eat-everything-but-beef-atarian‚Äù. lol 

I decided to jump on the Sema wave and I began 10/18/24. I started with .25 and it was painless, which I was thrilled about, because I HATE shots and cry every time lol. I felt fine most of the day, but I did have this ‚Äúhigh feeling.‚Äù Otherwise, I ate a small portion of rice, a skinless and boneless chicken breast, and some black beans. Later that day, I ate a homemade soup with veggies & one small chicken wing. I was satisfied for the day.

The next day, 10/19/24, things went a bit awry. I started with coffee as usual. Almond milk, monk fruit, and about 20oz or more of lemon water. I ate some grilled chicken, a tiny salad ,2 crab rangoons lol, and a Coke Zero. I was stuffed! My friend came by and bought me an expensive bottle of tequila as a cute surprise with flowers, and I wanted to taste it. I took half of a half of a shot and I was ok. We went to the Fox Theatre to see The Lion King and I went downhill by the end of it.

I snacked on cheese popcorn and I felt good, but some nausea crept in, she passed me some M&Ms and I ate a few, and by the end of that I was spinning a bit. We ended up going to grab a bite. I ordered lamb tacos and a salad. I took one bite of the taco and ate 3/4 of the salad, and 2 cups of water. I was done.

Waking up today (Sunday), I still have that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling behind my eyes, but I‚Äôm not nauseous, just a little tired and wavy feeling. 

Sorry this was so long! I just wanted to capture all of my good & naughty decisions and  just enlighten those who are curious! 

Also, I forgot to mention I injected on the right side of my belly. Definitely going for the thigh next time like many of you suggested!

A while back, I started working on a tool to help restaurants and bars manage staff shortages. Life got busy with school and work, so I put the project on hold. But recently, I visited a coffee shop in my city that was using something similar, and it reminded me how useful this idea could be.

Here‚Äôs the thing: the tool¬†**isn‚Äôt meant to replace waitresses, bartenders, or staff**. It‚Äôs just meant to make things smoother, especially when you‚Äôre short-staffed or really busy. We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a busy game night or a full restaurant‚Äîyou‚Äôre sitting at a table and just want to reorder a beer or grab some appetizers. But then, you end up waiting 20 minutes just to get someone‚Äôs attention.

This tool is designed to¬†**simplify**¬†that process.

**How it works**:

Customers scan a simple QR code at their table (many of you are already using), which opens your menu on their phone. From there, they can place an order (another beer, an appetizer, or whatever they want) and even pay for it right then and there. No need to wait for someone to come over. The QR code links directly to the table, so your staff knows exactly where to bring the order.

It‚Äôs all about keeping things¬†**quick, simple, and not intrusive**.

I can even integrate it with payment systems like Square or Stripe, so the process is seamless and easy for both you and your customers.

**Here‚Äôs how it can help:**

* Less pressure on staff.
* Faster reorders.
* Shorter wait times.
* Seamless payments.

And if you want extra features, I can also add things like tracking how long a table has been waiting, showing how much they‚Äôve spent, and giving you useful stats to help understand what‚Äôs working best for your business.

It‚Äôs really about making things smoother for both customers and staff‚Äî**without**¬†getting in the way of the personal service people expect when dining out.

I‚Äôd love to know what you think! What features would be most useful to you? What do you feel is missing from similar tools you‚Äôve seen?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, many of us work on the go. Whether you‚Äôre traveling for business or working remotely, having the right tools can make a huge difference. One such tool that is gaining traction is the travel ergonomic keyboard. This device is designed not just for efficiency but for comfort, especially during long hours of work. By using a travel ergonomic keyboard, you can enhance your mobile workstation experience significantly.

### Enhanced Comfort

One of the most immediate benefits of a travel ergonomic keyboard is the comfort it provides. Standard keyboards often lead to wrist strain and discomfort, especially when used for extended periods. The ergonomic design of these keyboards supports your hands and wrists, allowing you to work more comfortably. This is particularly important when you're working in cramped spaces, such as an airplane or caf√©. By optimizing your posture, these keyboards help alleviate discomfort.

### Improved Typing Efficiency

With a travel ergonomic keyboard, you can experience a noticeable boost in your typing speed and accuracy. Traditional keyboards may lead to more typos and mistakes due to their flat design, promoting bad habits. Ergonomically designed keyboards often come with a split layout or curved key design that encourages a more natural hand position. This ergonomic positioning makes it easier to type quickly and accurately, which is crucial when you‚Äôre under tight deadlines on the go.

### Compact and Lightweight Design

Travel ergonomic keyboards are crafted to be portable. Unlike bulky desktop keyboards, these keyboards are lightweight and compact, making them easy to pack in your travel bag. Here are some features that enhance their portability:

- **Folding Mechanism:** Many travel ergonomic keyboards can fold or collapse, saving valuable space in your luggage.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity:** Wireless options eliminate the hassle of untangling cords and make it easier to connect to multiple devices.
- **Durable Materials:** Most are built with resilient materials, ensuring they withstand the rigors of travel.

### Customizable Features

Another advantage of using a travel ergonomic keyboard is the customizable features it offers. Many models come with programmable keys, allowing you to set shortcuts and functions that save time. If you regularly use certain software or applications while on the move, having keys tailored to your needs can enhance your productivity remarkably. This feature empowers you to personalize your keyboard, making it an even more powerful tool for your mobile workstation.

### Protection Against Injuries

Long hours of typing can lead to injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome or repetitive strain injuries. By using a travel ergonomic keyboard, you're taking a proactive step towards protecting your health. The ergonomic design significantly reduces the risk of these injuries, allowing you to work longer without pain. This is particularly important for freelancers and remote workers who may be spending the entire day typing.

### Versatility for Various Devices

Another prime benefit of a travel ergonomic keyboard is its versatility. Most modern versions are compatible with multiple devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This flexibility allows you to switch between devices seamlessly, enhancing your workflow. Many keyboards support both Android and iOS systems, making them suitable for a wide range of users across different platforms.

### Battery Efficiency

Battery life is always a concern when traveling, especially if you're working remotely and do not have easy access to charging facilities. Travel ergonomic keyboards often use energy-efficient technologies, allowing them to sustain prolonged usage on a single charge. This way, you can work longer without worrying about your keyboard dying on you during a crucial moment.

A travel ergonomic keyboard is an excellent investment for anyone who works while traveling. It enhances comfort, boosts typing efficiency, and offers portability while protecting you from injury. Whether you're a digital nomad, a business professional, or simply a remote worker, integrating a travel ergonomic keyboard into your mobile workstation can elevate your travel experience. With customizable features, versatility with devices, and impressive battery efficiency, these keyboards are crafted to meet the needs of today's agile work environments. Embrace the advantages of using a travel ergonomic keyboard and transform your mobile workspace experience!

Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Travel Ergonomic Keyboard
------------------------------------------------------------------

When you're on the go, a standard keyboard might not cut it, especially if you‚Äôre someone who types a lot. Luckily, travel ergonomic keyboards are gaining popularity for their comfort and portability. Choosing the right one can make a significant difference in how you work, especially while traveling. Here‚Äôs what you should keep in mind when selecting the perfect travel ergonomic keyboard for your needs.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/travel-ergonomic-keyboard  
  
### Portability

Your keyboard must be lightweight and compact. Consider how easily it fits into your laptop bag or backpack. A good travel ergonomic keyboard should be slim enough to carry around without adding bulk to your luggage. Look for a model that folds or can be rolled up to save space. This feature is crucial if you're traveling frequently.

### Design and Layout

Design plays a vital role in comfort. An ergonomic keyboard typically features a split layout that allows your wrists to rest naturally. Look for a travel ergonomic keyboard with adjustable angles. This helps reduce strain on your wrists during long typing sessions. Also, verify if the keyboard has dedicated function keys that you use often, as this can enhance workflow efficiency.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/travel-ergonomic-keyboard  
  
### Key Travel and Feedback

Key travel measures how far the key goes down when you press it. A well-designed travel ergonomic keyboard should provide a satisfying key response. Too little travel can lead to mistakes, while too much can slow you down. Here‚Äôs what to consider:

- **Low-Profile Keys:** These are often easier to press when typing at speed.
- **Key Feedback:** Ensure that the keyboard gives you a tactile response so you know when a key has registered.

### Connectivity Options

Stay connected! The best travel ergonomic keyboards will offer multiple connectivity options. Bluetooth is a popular choice for its convenience, but USB connectivity may be useful too. Make sure the keyboard can easily connect to your devices without complicated settings. Also, check how many devices it can connect to at once, as some keyboards can switch between multiple devices effortlessly.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/travel-ergonomic-keyboard  
  
### Battery Life

There's nothing worse than a keyboard dying in the middle of a project. A travel ergonomic keyboard should have a long battery life so you can work without interruption. Some models come with rechargeable batteries, while others use replaceable batteries. Always check how long the battery lasts on a single charge to avoid frequent downtime.

### Material and Build Quality

Quality matters! The materials used in the construction of your keyboard affect its overall durability. Look for travel ergonomic keyboards made of sturdy materials that can withstand wear and tear while being portable. Additionally, a spill-resistant design can safeguard against accidents, which is particularly advantageous while traveling.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/travel-ergonomic-keyboard  
  
### Price Point

When choosing a travel ergonomic keyboard, consider your budget. Ergonomic features often come at a premium, but a higher price doesn't always guarantee quality. Research and compare various keyboards in your price range. Look for reviews that highlight user experiences to help guide your decision.

### Additional Features

Some extra features can enhance your typing experience:

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/travel-ergonomic-keyboard  
  
- **Backlighting:** Helpful for working in low-light conditions.
- **Customizable Keys:** Allows you to set shortcuts for your most-used functions.
- **Wrist Support:** Some keyboards come with built-in wrist pads for extra comfort.

By keeping these key features in mind, you can make an informed choice when investing in a travel ergonomic keyboard. After all, comfort and efficiency are paramount, especially while you're on the move. Make sure to identify which features resonate with your preferences and typing style to ensure you select a keyboard that enhances your travel experience.

Whether you are heading to a caf√©, a conference, or a plane, having the right keyboard can make your work-life balance smoother. Choose wisely, and you‚Äôll be typing in comfort no matter where your travels take you!

### Conclusion

Choosing the right travel ergonomic keyboard can significantly enhance your mobile work experience. By integrating a keyboard designed with ergonomics in mind, you can minimize discomfort during extended typing sessions, whether you‚Äôre working from a coffee shop, airport, or any remote location. The benefits are clear: improved posture, reduced strain on your hands and wrists, and the ability to maintain productivity when on the go.

When selecting a travel ergonomic keyboard, keep an eye out for key features such as compact design, lightweight materials, and adjustable angles.

Quality materials will not only ensure durability but also enhance your typing experience with responsive keys that cater to your mobile needs.

Don‚Äôt forget to consider connectivity options, like Bluetooth or USB-C, for versatility across different devices. Backlit keys can also be a valuable feature if you often work in low-light environments. Ultimately, investing in a travel ergonomic keyboard tailored to your specific requirements can prevent discomfort and improve your overall efficiency.

However, he was extremely moody; some days he would engage in small talk while other days, he ignored people. He never properly trained me on the job and gave me vague instructions. He assumed I would ask questions when I didn't know something. I never really felt comfortable to ask questions because I didn't know what mood he would be in.

There was one time I put together a detailed document that he found extremely useful. After that, he encouraged me to set up coffee chats and offered to mentor me. I already had a mentor; the company assigns everyone a mentor, but anyone is welcome to find another mentor if they wish. I figured it was best to engage in bare minimal conversation to get the work done.

  
Eventually, I departed from the company due to personal reasons. After three years, I returned to my old job where he was promoted to manager and he still remembers me. I thought he was the same old person, but my colleagues are afraid to ask him questions because he has made outright rude, frustrated comments in the group chat when things aren't going as planned. On the side, he encourages me to ask him questions.

I (US based) am seeking to upgrade my morning coffee into a flat white experience. I would typically make 2-4 drinks per day. 

If I go to a nice coffee shop, I like a flat white with really silky milk froth. It's my absolute favorite coffee. The silkier the better, especially if I can get some really silky oat milk. I almost never drink espresso without a milk component, so I don't want to optimize for espresso quality by itself.

A friend of mine gifted me my first espresso machine. It doesn't seem to have an actual model name...but it's a ""Gevi Espresso Machine 20 Bar High Pressure"" which retails around $120.

This taught me a lot about what I am seeking in an espresso machine -- It turns out that I use it exclusively for something resembling a cappuccino, to steam whole milk or oat milk. So what I've learned here is that as long as I'm making milk-based drinks, even this cheap little machine can produce a coffee flavor that is just fine! (As long as I use medium roast beans.) 

So, really, the milk frothing is what I want to optimize around. If I'm after the silkiest flat white milk foam, and I am less concerned about coffee quality, what are my options?

I'm very interested to know if there is a machine that can accomplish this around $500, but also to know if $1000 or $1500 price points would be drastically better to get that silky beautiful foam. 

Do you have a machine you personally use to create flat whites with really silky beautiful foam? Want to post a picture and tell me what machine you use?

I recently started dating for the first time this past month (I'm in my early 20s and a late bloomer) and honestly it hasn't been going too well. 

I went on a couple of first dates and I made the mistake of falling for these men too quickly and then getting really sad/disappointed when they didn't want a second date. I feel like I'm not gonna find anyone and that I'll be alone forever, not because I don't think the right person for me is out there but because I think I'm just too exhausted by the dating process to want to try and find them. Dating just sucks cause you gotta put in time and effort for something that usually doesn't work out. Also, how hard you try absolutely doesn't correlate with ""success"" cause it's all based on luck. I mean hell, if you try too hard you're actually screwing yourself over mental health wise. 



I'm not sure why I made this post. I guess just as a method of decompressing/self reflecting cause I feel upset over my latest rejection. Also, does anyone have any advice on how to not get burnt out by dating?

  
Here are my reflections on dating and the mistakes I made this past month:

I realized I messed up in my approach to dating by giving too much to the point where I burnt myself out too quickly. I have a scarcity mentality (due to low self esteem) so I tried really hard to make it work with all of the men that I matched with, even when we obviously weren't compatible. 

Things I did wrong:

* I initiated basically every convo. 
* I bent over backwards to be entertaining and interesting
* I was the one who asked them out and planned every date I went on
* I traveled far as hell (like 2 hours via public transit) to get to these dates (instead of asking them to meet me halfway)
* On the dates, I was more focused on impressing them and being funny and interesting vs trying to actually get to know them
* I was constantly communicating and felt uncomfortable with any silences or gaps in texting 
* I asked for second dates even when I didn't really feel a spark or saw us being compatible in the long term just because I wanted the validation of getting a second date (never got a second date with anyone!)
* I ignored red flags (none of these men checked in on me/asked me to text them when I get home to ensure I got home safely even though I'm a young woman who was traveling long distances during the evening via public transit. I literally got catcalled on these dates (by strangers, not the men I was with). Despite that, no one cared enough to make sure I didn't get assaulted or kidnapped on the way home because they truly were not interested in me or my well-being) 
* I also spent way too long texting these people (like two weeks) before meeting up which caused me to develop an idealized version of them in my head (which further fueled my attempts to make things work even though they clearly weren't gonna). 

  
Next time I try dating again, I'm just gonna meet up with people as soon as I can at a coffee shop that's close to home or something. That way I don't need to expend a lot of time and energy and I'll be able to determine if we have any chemistry before getting invested.

Also quick aside: Before someone tells me I was dating people out of my league, they were all a bunch of nerdy tech workers so I'd like to believe they were very much within my league. ",4,1729443319.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False
1g8399x,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g8399x/i_cant_get_away_from_my_mother/,I cant get away from my mother,"Throwaway acc. Sorry, English is not my first language. This story needs some context. I (27F) currently live with my mother (45) and my fiancee in a small apartment, not by choice.  
My mom and dad got divorced 15 years ago and she was the one who raised me and supported me through uni. She went abroad to work so she could keep me in uni as it was a very demanding degree and I couldnt work. During my last year of uni she told me she got fed up to keep sending money and that she wants to live for herself. Understandable as she gave birth to me very young and she was not able to live her life freely until then.

Before covid she quit her job and stayed with her bf who was a very wealthy person. She hasnt been working since then. In 2022 she decided to come back to our homecountry and break up with her partner. I was going through a break up myself so we decided to move together in a new city, in a small apartment and I found a job there. She still didnt work as she was sent money by her ex who wanted her back and even stayed with us for a while to convince her to get back together.

I then found my current fiancee and moved to another city for 6 months and she stayed in the apartment. When her ex realized there was no way they would get back together he stopped sending her money and from then on I had to pay the rent for a place that I did not live in anymore. She is a healthy, fully functional person so there is no obstacle in her getting a job and being able to support herself.

After the 6 months passed my fiancee and I moved back to that apartment and we had another home in another city we went regularly to as he had business there but I didnt like it there. Months before that we asked her if we should find another place as that current one was too small for the three of us and she said we didnt need to cause she was going to move out before we moved back in.  

We moved back in, months passed, and I still fully supported her financially cause she didnt have a job and no money saved anymore. I became very frustrated with her day by day cause I told her she needed to get her shit together and she said she was afraid that she would not be able to do it alone. I said you need to find a solution, I will help but you need to do something. She didnt do anything. She just painted, smoked, drank coffee and stayed on the phone with her friends all day. 

All this while I worked from home and she was the boss in the house I paid for. She told me when to get the trash out, when to wash the dishes, when to do chores during my work schedule. I put the foot down one day and told her I cant live like this anymore, she needs to find a job and a place and she was very offended, saying that she was shocked I thought that way and that family needs to be together and help each other.

 I said sorry, this is my opinion and my wish as I cant be responsible for a healthy, mature person who just didnt want to work. I had a convo about her possibly having depression and suggested a therapist but she refused. She got into spirituality and has a different way of approaching things.

After that convo she went abroad again for 6 months and worked, she was very happy with her job and lifestyle there as she was surrounded by distant cousins that she got along with very well. We were staying in that apartment and traveled to our second home regularly. (meaning we were 2 weeks there, 2 weeks to that other place).

After 6 months she quit her job because it involved working with chemicals she found out she was actually allergic to. She went to another country, to another cousin and ""looked"" for work for 2 months. No success. 

She decided to come back to our country, told me she was gonna stay to our place only for 3 weeks as she didnt want to bother us. I told her ok, but you should have a plan about what youre going to do. She earned enough money to buy land somewhere in the countryside in our country. 

Its been 6 months since she came back. And the situation is the same. She moved back into our small apartment, blew almost all her money cause, again, she didnt work (she didnt want to work - she had convenient job offers near our house but she refused saying it will affect her freedom and her time). 

She is back to her hobbies and habits and with no intention to move out or work even though she knows it bothers me and the place is too small. She changed everything in this house to her liking, started hoarding shit and I am now suffocating in it. 

Basically she turned my space into hers without asking me (cause I was away most of the time during this period). And yes, I was paying the rent and the bills all this time. I am so frustrated that I have to open this unpleasant conversation again and tell her to find her place and do whatever she wants but not near me.. She acts like she thinks I owe it to her and I dont think so. 

In almost 6 years she had been working for only 6 months. Because she discovered she can be free of responsibilities on my account. She even asked me to pay her phone bills because she was too lazy to install an app in her phone and put her card in it. We got into a huge fight once because I didnt pay it on time and she had her services cut off. 

I want to talk to her. Today, tomorrow. And I dont know how to start this unpleasant conversation. I kept telling her to figure out what she wants to do and work towards it but she got mad everytime I brought up the subject. 

She was acting like the victim after our first discussion and complained to my aunt and grandma that I kicked her out of the house. But I need to establish boundaries before I start resenting her. I am grateful for all she did for me and for raising me but I dont think I should pay her back like this.",3,1729443295.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

It was a wonder that she remembered to hike up her bridesmaid‚Äôs dress as she sat down keeping it clean and dry, or she would have to face the wrath of her sister if she ever decided to join the crowd once again.    

In the distance, a tune of a slow love song drifted, and the urge to join the party was tempting. But a quiet moment away from everyone was what her soul yearned for. She swayed solely to the tune, a hum escaped her lips as she sipped from the champagne flute. 


She wasn‚Äôt drunk, just tipsy enough to remember a moment in the past, tipsy enough to want to be in that moment again. She wanted a life. Not wallow in self-pity for a ruined relationship that happened five months ago. She wanted to be happy. Not to go back to a monotonous life of coffee, work and microwaved dinner. 

Someone coughed, and Iris was startled out of her reverie, sloshing the bubbly champagne and almost ruining her dress. Annoyed at being disturbed in her quiet moment, she turned around her lips pulling down to offer some harsh words, only to be struck dumb by the newcomer‚Äôs presence.

I am Myth, 21+ female with nearly eight years of roleplaying. 

Today I am looking for anyone who can play advanced literate male roles who writes in 3rd person POV, and who would like to work on a simple wholesome slice-of-life roleplay that flows from the above starter. 

Who will you be playing as? 

It‚Äôs your choice. Are you the Bestman or one of the groomsmen who accidentally stumbled onto her moment of solitude? A guest at the party? Someone she knows very well, like a best friend who has gone in search of her? Or are you a total stranger, who accidentally saw her wallowing in self-pity and decided to approach?

And what comes next? Let‚Äôs decide together.

My preferred writing platform is Discord, but I do not mind working on Google docs as well.

Please send me a reddit message if you are interested. 

Cheers!

The collapse is approaching and omlne of the reason is demography, Tunisia is the last fertile country in the developing world there are less new born every year and this due to the economic crisis that hit the population since 2010 and due to the fact that most people are leaving the country en masse especially highly skilled and educated people. 

Politically there are no vision for the future and the economic outlook is kinda dark the country is unable to attract investors in fields with high added values we only relies on textiles and tourism in country that is suffering from water scarcity.
In the same order of ideas the country is investing millions in building desalination station in country suffering that import energy from the global market instead of repairing the infrastructure which can bring the same amount of water we trying to pump from desalination station at lesser cost. 1m3 of dessalinated water cost almost 9DInars the state is going to sell it at 0.5 Dinars. Good business!! 

So lately buying coffee is considered a luxury and the state is publicly announcing the purchase few tons of coffee like it's a big achievement. All while hiking the prices of everything. I'm amazed that average Chinese phones cost over 1000dinars. 

Another thing that we should talk about is staggering number of illegal sub saharien immigrants present across the country. We share absolutely zero responsibility in the suffering of these people but we're playing europe guard dog now holding thousands of people with no education and income in the country and hoping that the problem will solve it self but in return it created more problems from human trafficking to small town and agricultural lands are turned into tents cities.

This award not only honors the craft brewing art, but also the innovative experience that the family brewery has created for beer lovers around the historic headquarters dating back to 1887.

The brewery site of the Gebr. Maisel brewery in Bayreuth has developed steadily in recent years and now offers a diverse range of beer, enjoyment and craftsmanship. 
This includes the brewery itself, which was named ""Brewery of the Year 2024"" in Germany, and Maisel's Beer Experience World, where four generations of brewing craftsmanship can be experienced between tradition and modernity and visitors can watch the master brewers at work. In addition, you can immerse yourself in the craft in other dimensions: the Crazy Sheep coffee factory roasts the beans fresh in front of the guests' eyes, the Liebesbier Restaurant offers 100 different beers and a view into the Maisel & Friends brewing workshop as well as international dishes. Around the Liebesbier Urban Art Hotel there is an open-air gallery with urban and street art works as well as sculptures by international artists.

""We are already a magnet for beer and enjoyment fans from all over the world and this top-class recommendation for a visit makes us incredibly proud,"" says Michael Feuerstein, Head of Culture & Tourism at Maisel & Friends. 
""We want to make the craft of brewing tangible in all its facets. In recent years we have implemented numerous projects that have turned our brewery site into a mecca for beer enthusiasts. I am very pleased that more and more people are no longer just coming to Bayreuth for Wagner, but also for beer, enjoyment and craftsmanship."" 
The award from London is also an incentive for the family company's team to create more new experiences and attractions in order to keep inspiring visitors. 
""After all, our goal is to become one of the most important beer travel destinations in the world.""

There are still a few historic buildings on the Maisel & Friends brewery site that are in a deep sleep. They are just waiting to be breathed new life into. For 2025, the Maisel & Friends team has set itself the goal of further developing and modernizing the Maisel's beer experience world. In the future, visitors will not only be able to discover beer with all their senses, but will also have a unique, interactive experience around the four raw materials of beer and the craft of brewing. ""Bayreuth belongs on the bucket list of everyone who is passionate about beer and enjoyment,"" Feuerstein sums up proudly.

The fact that love of beer, passion and quality pay off was confirmed once again for us at this year's World Beer Awards . We were already delighted to receive numerous medals in the first round. 

Bronze went to Maisel & Friends Stefan's Indian Ale (Cat. IPA/English Style), defending its 2022 ranking.
 
For Maisel & Friends Marc's Chocolate Bock, the medal ceremony was even more successful: In the Stout & Porter/Strong Porter category, the beer was able to improve on last year's bronze medal and win silver.

Some beer specialties were also able to claim the highest point on the winners' podium. The gold medal went to Maisel & Friends IPA (Cat. IPA/American Style) and Maisel & Friends Hell (Cat. Hoppy Pilsner). 

Gold also went to Maisel & Friends Jeff's Bavarian Ale (cat. wheat beer/hoppy wheat beer), Maisel & Friends alcohol-free (cat. no & low alcohol) and Maisel & Friends West Coast IPA (cat. IPA/American Style), which also secured the title of Country Winner and are in their category ""Germany's best beers"". 

With this success, they secured a place in the Style Winner race - which was particularly successful for Maisel & Friends Jeff's Bavarian Ale: As in 2022, the beer specialty was able to stand out from the competition and was named the world's best hoppy wheat beer for the second time in a row.",1,1729442994.0,In_the_name_of_Beers,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve always been that guy who gets anxious even thinking about starting a conversation with someone I like. For months now, I‚Äôve had a crush on this girl (20F) at my local coffee shop. She always sits by the window, reading some novel, looking so absorbed in her own world. Every time I see her, I want to say something, but I end up just grabbing my coffee and leaving. ( i know sounds like filmy but its true, trust me)

A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon this AI dating coach called ""Olivia."" Honestly, I was skeptical at first. An AI? Giving dating advice? It felt a bit weird. But I figured, why not? It‚Äôs not like I was doing any better on my own.

What surprised me, though, was how ""Olivia"" didn‚Äôt just give generic advice. It actually helped me craft small, genuine conversation starters based on what I shared. I mentioned that the girl seemed into books, and Olivia suggested I ask her if she had any recommendations for a good read. Simple, but not something I would have come up with on my own.

The day came, and I saw her there again, by the window, completely immersed in her book. My heart was racing, but I remembered what ""Olivia"" had taught me about dating psychology. So, I took a deep breath, approached her, and asked, ‚ÄúHey, I noticed you‚Äôre always reading something interesting. Do you have any recommendations for someone looking to get into something new?‚Äù

To my surprise, she smiled and started talking about her favorite genres and books she‚Äôd recently enjoyed. We ended up chatting for about 20 minutes, and I left with a list of book recommendations and, more importantly, the realization that it wasn‚Äôt as terrifying as I‚Äôd always thought.

I don‚Äôt know if anything more will come from it, but just having that conversation was a huge win for me. It‚Äôs funny, but having ""Olivia"" kind of felt like having a friend who understands social anxiety and helps you take those first steps.

If anyone else feels stuck like I was, it might be worth giving an AI dating coach a shot. It‚Äôs not magic, but it definitely helped me get out of my own head a bit. By the way, it's available on [phymech.com](http://phymech.com) thank me later if it helps you too!

So I was texting this girl from last Saturday, I asked her out for Sunday, but she said she‚Äôs going to see friend or whatever, and she hopes she will be free next weekend(this weekend) for coffee. 

So we texted during week, was going good, she would send me something like good morning message with a smile and some other pictures, I asked about date, and she said ‚ÄûI‚Äôll tell you Saturday after work, if I would work long then I won‚Äôt be in shape for meeting‚Äù and I was okay with that.

So we texted a bit more after this, I sent her hello message in Saturday morning, and got no reply

She read message somewhere around Sunday noon, but not replied. 

I don‚Äôt really get why would she do that, should I text her again and check what happend? Or should I just block her on snap, unmatch on tinder and keep going somewhere else. ",1,1729442645.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I have learned so much from this forum over the last few weeks. Thank you to this amazing community! My husband & I have a week long trip planned to Viet Nam in early November. Since we were flying through Japan on our way there, we decided to add on to the beginning of the trip and spend 6-days in Japan. The idea was to see the fall foliage, but I'm afraid we may be too late for that. We've been to Japan twice before, and this time around we wanted to explore some new areas. My husband has always wanted to see Hokkaido & I have always wanted to visit Naoshima. Granted, it's a bit of a frenetic itinerary, but it checks a lot of boxes for us. We are fairly adventurous travelers. 

We are flying into CTS in the morning on a Saturday, and we fly out in the afternoon Tuesday. That basically only gives us 3 full days to explore - we will have a rental car. We like nice hotels and good food. If you could weigh in on my proposed itinerary, I'd love some feedback. I know it's too short, but it's all of the time we can manage within the parameters of our pre-planned travel in Viet Nam.

TLDR: My big questions, is Lake Toya better than Noboribetsu if I can only do one? Should we plan to have dinner in Sapporo or Otaru on Day 2? I feel like we don't have enough time in Sapporo to hit all of the restaurants I would like to try, so I am leaning towards heading back there for dinner. Is it out of season to try and canoe in Jozankei? Any suggestions for lunch on the road either in Jozankei or Otaru or someplace in between?

1g82vct,https://www.reddit.com/r/RipeStories/comments/1g82vct/missionary_madness/,Missionary Madness,"A friend of mine was once accosted in her own home by a couple of missionaries from some branch of Christianity -- neither she nor I ever knew which one. When she came to the door, they said, ""Good morning, ma'am! Do you have a few minutes? We'd love to talk to you about the Bible."" 

Well, my friend is an Orthodox Jew. She can talk Bible with the best of 'em. 

So she smiles and says, ""Oh, I love a good Bible discussion! What's your take on the meaning of..."" and she names some extremely obscure biblical interpretation controversy from within the Orthodox community. She's basically asking them how they'd interpret a long phrase in ancient Hebrew. She rattles off the phrase and looks at them expectantly.

""No? Well, what about..."" and she rattles off another one. 

After a couple of tries, the missionaries timidly admit that they don't actually *know* Hebrew, so they can't really have an opinion on the interpretation of the Hebrew phrases she's been mentioning. 

My friend stares at them, wearing her best shocked face. ""Don't know *Hebrew?!* Why on earth not?!? How can you possibly understand the Word of God if you don't even read it in the original?"" 

They mumble something about how almost nobody really learns Hebrew these days -- it's much too hard a language. 

My friend smiles cheerfully and calls, ""Sarah, sweetie! Please come to the door -- and bring the big Tanakh that's on the coffee table!""

In trots a pretty little girl with two long, dark braids. She's all of about five years old, and the big book is almost too much for her to carry, but she holds it super carefully. Her mom takes it and holds it in front of Sarah, asking the child, ""Please open it to any page, the first one you find, and read a bit for these gentlemen, won't you?"" 

Brimming with pride at being invited to show off her scholarship, little Sarah opens the Bible and starts reading the Hebrew sentences as simply and easily as you'd read an English novel. She's only five -- a lot of kids don't even read too well in one language by that age, but Sarah's Hebrew is as good as her English. 

She finishes the paragraph, and her mother thanks her and sends her back to put the book away. Then she turns to the missionaries and asks, ""I'm sorry, what were you saying?"" 

What they said at this point was that they had to be going; that it had been a lovely discussion but they really had to get on their way, etc. They practically fell over each other to get away from her door. 

Before they got to the end of her stairway, she calls to them, and they stop and look back. She points to the mezuzah on her door.

""Gentlemen, you see this?"" They nod nervously. 

""Well, I think you should know that in pretty much any house that's got one of these on the door, you're going to find somebody like me. It's up to you whether you consider that a good thing or a bad thing."" 

They nodded and mumbled thanks for the information and then scurried away. My friend checked with her neighbors later, and so far as she could tell, they didn't knock on a single other door in her neighborhood, nearly all of which were Jewish homes that wore the mezuzah proudly. She thinks they were just too scared of getting into a biblical argument with a better-armed opponent.

A big movie production comes and starts shooting where she lives and she meets a famous actor who is arrogant. He's playing the main character in an a christmas carol type movie (so scrooge. But I can't remember if they stayed completely true to the original) and they incorporate his role into real life. It's like a love story between him and the girl.

Now all of this I know 100% was in the book, this next part I'm pretty sure it was too but I could also be unknowingly mixing in details I read in a different book.

I believe her brother was in jail and her father owned a convenience store or her brother robbed a convenience store and that's why he's in jail. Her dad could have owned the diner or whatever she worked at. It's one of those. I think she danced when she was little and stars may have played a role in her life. Maybe the dance studio had something to do with stars, not sure. And I'm pretty sure her and the big movie star visit her old school or something. And something about a tree maybe.

The Pankecakes to be satisfying and the coffee not too expensive. 

Topics ranging from the typical berlin smalltalk about rent and public transportation, to more elaborate ones. 

At times it got really loud, what was a good indicator that everybody had somebody to talk to. 
But made conversations across the whole table nearly impossible. 

Switching places would have been an option, but didn't end up happening.

Enough of the background story and onto the part where I actually tell the story , so my friend ( now ex-roommate ) was annoying my puppy ( Labrador mix) and he jumped on her causing her to spill her ( cold) coffee onto her shirt , ever since then she‚Äôs had some sort of sick grudge against max ( my dog) and has been doing all sorts of things such as ‚Äúforgetting ‚Äú to put water in his bowl and throwing his favourite toy into the trash, I have confronted her about this but she tells me they‚Äôre just accidents. However last
 week she took him to a shelter and has only told me ‚Äú he‚Äôs probably already dead by now ‚Äú
I kicked her out and screamed at her.

My mutual friends are telling me it‚Äôs just a dog and I‚Äôve blocked some of them but the rest are still freaking out at me . So aitah?

In the vibrant city of Portland, where the scent of coffee mingled with the distant echo of basketballs bouncing, there was a little-known pub called ""The Katu."" Tucked away on a quiet street, it wasn‚Äôt just famous for its caramel lattes but also for its enigmatic owner, Clara. Passionate about the Portland Trail Blazers, Clara had devised an unconventional way for fans to watch games without paying a dime.



The story unfolds one rainy evening as a motley crew of Blazers fans arrives at The Katu. Among them was Leo, an aspiring journalist disillusioned by the constraints of traditional media. With his worn-out notebook and a camera that had seen better days, he sought stories that resonated with the hearts of everyday people. \\



‚ÄúLeo!‚Äù Clara called out from behind the bar, her apron dusted with flour. ‚ÄúGrab a seat! We‚Äôre practically bursting at the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢=seams tonight!‚Äù



As the game approached, tension filled the air. Clara always had a knack for creating a community, even amidst the din of anticipation. She shared her secret: she tapped into satellite feeds that came from unusual sources. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about connections, my friend,‚Äù she once told Leo, ‚Äúthe essence of community at its finest.‚Äù



Meanwhile, Ella, a fierce activist and a die-hard Blazers fan, played the role of captain among the crowd. Tall with a shock of red hair, she organized viewing parties and led chants, invigorating the room with her fervor. Tonight was no different. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs rally together!‚Äù she shouted, her eyes shining like beacons. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre more than fans ‚Äì we‚Äôre a family!‚Äù



As the tip-off approached, Leo couldn‚Äôt ignore the surreal energy that swirled around the bar. Friends and strangers alike, all united under one common love. Yet, his mind drifted to his own dreams of being a storyteller‚Äîa dream that felt stifled under the weight of ‚Äúreal news‚Äù and sponsored content.



Just when the game began, a blaring siren interrupted their cheers. A storm was brewing outside, and the electricity flickered ominously. Leo glanced at Clara, whose face expressed both concern and determination. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the first storm we‚Äôve weathered,‚Äù she murmured.



Suddenly, the power went out, plunging The Katu into darkness. Gasps filled the bar, but Clara quickly lit a few candles, casting a warm glow over her patrons. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôve got our very own ‚ÄòBlazer Theater‚Äô set up in the basement‚Äîa projector and a backup generator!‚Äù she exclaimed.



Intrigued, Leo followed the crowd down the narrow staircase, where the walls were adorned with memorabilia and historical snapshots of the team. The space felt sacred, crammed with the essence of countless games played within those walls.



As the projector flickered to life, illuminating the wall with images of past highlights and memorable dunks, Clara turned to Leo. ‚ÄúI have a feeling that the story you seek is right here in this room, amidst all the laughter and heartache.‚Äù



With Ella‚Äôs leading chants echoing through the sometimes chaotic atmosphere, the fans were entranced. Leo witnessed the deep connection each person had not only to the team but to one another. Old friends reunited and new friendships blossomed, all born from a love for the Blazers.



Moved by the kaleidoscope of emotions around him, Leo started jotting down notes, capturing the magic of the moment. He wrote about Clara‚Äîthe visionary who created a space for passion to thrive; about Ella‚Äîthe heartbeat of the fans; and about the collective memories woven together by every basket made or missed.



Throughout the game, the Blazers struggled against their rivals, and yet, the energy remained buoyant. The fans roared, cheered, and even gasped, as though they were each a player on the court. Despite the score, happiness bubbled over, proving that these moments were not defined solely by wins but by shared experiences.



When the final buzzer sounded in defeat, an unexpected thing happened. Instead of despair, the crowd erupted into laughter and conversation. Clara raised her hands, signaling for everyone to quiet down. ‚ÄúTonight was a testament to what we can achieve together‚Äîeven in darkness!‚Äù she proclaimed.



With spirits unbroken, the patrons lifted their glasses high, toasting to friendship, unity, and the love of the game. Leo, encapsulated by the warmth in the room, suddenly realized that his story wasn‚Äôt just about winning or losing; it was about community, resilience, and finding joy amid uncertainty.



As the night wore on and stories flowed freely, Leo recognized that he had found his narrative‚Äînot hidden behind paywalls or corporate agendas but alive and breathing within the hearts of ordinary people chasing extraordinary moments.



When he left The Katu that night, drenched in the cool, refreshing rain of Portland, he felt lighter, inspired. He had discovered that writing his truths would bring more than just words to paper; it would bridge a connection between his dreams and reality, capturing the spirit of those who danced in the shadows of a game they loved.



And in a world filled with noise, he had become part of a story worth telling‚Äîa story rooted in the essence of community, illuminated by the flicker of candlelight, and embraced by the roaring spirit of Blazers fans united, forever in the shadow of the game.",1,1729441675.0,NbaDiscord,0,1.0,False

At the time of writing this, it is October 19th, 2024.

>Note that I have changed names and locations to help protect the identities of those involved.

>People in this story:

>Me (32 M), my wife (28 F), Shev (26 M), Katerina (33 F), Isabella (30 F), Couples-Therapist (42 F), my mother (61 F).

My wife and I shared what felt like a fairy-tale relationship. After nine incredible months together‚Äîincluding one spent living together‚Äîwe eloped! Soon after, she returned to Russia to settle her affairs (ha, pun), but when the invasion of Ukraine hit a month later, she had to flee back to Canada before she could finish packing. I supported her fully, covering her immigration costs, medical bills, and living expenses as she adjusted to a new life. I didn‚Äôt have much, but she didn‚Äôt care. We struggled financially, but as long as we had each other and our love, we found a way to make it work. With her encouragement, I eventually found a better job in January 2024, and when she landed a secure, well-paying government position in March 2024, it felt like we had finally reached a place of stability. We believed we were building something lasting. For those first two and a half years, filled with both struggle and success, we were happier than we ever thought possible.

However, we had one recurring issue: she felt threatened by a very attractive close female friend of mine named Isabella, who I met only days prior to her. I kept insisting that we shouldn‚Äôt try to control each other‚Äôs friendships, however ultimately did respect her wishes through actions, almost cutting Jessica off from me completely after my wife and I married. Unfortunately, this left her feeling unheard‚Äîshe was only taking in my words, not my actions. Regrettably, I suggested she work through these feelings with her therapist alone, saying I couldn‚Äôt resolve jealousy for her. In response, she‚Äôd quietly lash out, sharing her frustrations with anyone who would listen and painting a picture of how I‚Äôd wronged or cheated her. It wasn‚Äôt until much later, in one of our final couples therapy sessions on September 24, 2024, that I realized I had mistaken her hurt as jealousy. What she needed was support from me during a deeply challenging and scary time, and I told her to deal with it alone. Her lashing out, I came to see, was her way of reaching out for understanding and safety. When we finally came to terms with this, we cried together, releasing a massive weight. However, by that time, it was already too late...

[Shev with some other girl at one of the many raves he invited my wife to.](https://preview.redd.it/rx6n73henxvd1.jpg?width=1430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef6ba5a3b13071452efc65da5e4d6b2e5e193fd1)

On June 12, 2024, I encouraged her to join a new Russian friend group she‚Äôd met at a concert. I hoped these friendships would ease her sense of isolation and provide the support network she had been missing. This lively group of fellow Russians seemed like a welcome reminder of home. Among them was a man named Shev, who, within weeks, began aggressively pursuing her‚Äîsending post-shower selfies, kissy-faces, long messages praising her, and persistently asking her to ""hang out."" The first time I met him (a week later), I could tell he had a huge crush on her, and I told her as much. She brushed it off, assuring me nothing would ever happen, saying he was ‚Äútoo lacking in the looks department‚Äù or ‚Äúlooked too much like a fuzzy potato‚Äù for her, and, ""besides, he respects you too much because of how good you are to me."" But as they grew closer, by July, he quickly became her best friend and confidant, deepening their bond by tapping into the personal issues she shared with him. It was here he found his ‚Äúin,‚Äù when she confided in him about my friend Isabella who, at this point, I hadn‚Äôt seen in over two years.Around this time, her behavior changed drastically, almost as if she became a different person overnight. She started staying out until 9 AM, going to raves, stopped helping with household chores, began spending excessively, and even neglected her hygiene‚Äîshe stopped brushing her teeth, rarely showered, and barely slept. She became distant whenever I tried to hug her, refused to let me clean her lunch or coffee containers when she got back from work, stopped exercising, and her sexual preferences shifted dramatically‚Äîfrom being 100% straight and conservative to suddenly very bisexual and kinky, but with little sex drive for me. She‚Äôd even consistently ask me to prepare meals, only to refuse to eat them when I finished, often throwing them out after they'd sit for weeks in the fridge. These sudden changes left me feeling confused and hurt, as though the woman I had known for almost four years was vanishing‚Äîor had never really existed. Seeing this, I doubled down on trying to make this better by working harder, doing more, and avoiding conflict through sensitive subjects, while still addressing her feelings.

[Shev sending a \\""casual\\"" selfie to my wife.](https://preview.redd.it/fxhnmd5lnxvd1.jpg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23d3b2888ee4e85bb90584882c64463910d21ac5)

As Shev‚Äôs connection with her grew, he started to fill spaces in her life that I hadn‚Äôt. Where I wouldn‚Äôt sing (I'm terrible), he‚Äôd sing for her. While I avoided loud, late-night concerts, he‚Äôd buy her tickets for anything that started after 9 PM. Instead of buying a car, I was focused on saving for a home so we could start a family‚Äîa goal she had pushed heavily for‚Äîbut it meant I wasn‚Äôt taking her on unplanned 30 hour road trips like he would in his Lexus. At one point, early on when we were discussing buying a place, I mentioned to her that our household income was incredibly high for Canada, and she responded by telling me that it‚Äôs not because Shev makes double my salary. In that, I could feel her slipping away. When I tried to address her time with Shev, she‚Äôd offer contradicting stories, lies, or denials, accusing me of being paranoid and controlling. She even called Shev ‚Äúher Isabella,‚Äù and asked, how does it feel? One of her new friends from this Russian group, Katerina, even suggested to my wife I was so crazy that I‚Äôd install tracking devices or hidden cameras. Both hurtful and absurd accusations. If my wife's stories didn‚Äôt add up, she‚Äôd accuse me of ‚Äúnot listening‚Äù or dismiss it as a misunderstanding. Every time this happened I stuck to my established values, assuring her I trusted her, I wasn‚Äôt trying to control who she was friends with and I believed she‚Äôd make the right choices. I also apologized for any misunderstandings on my part. It was around then that she stopped mentioning Shev altogether, instead having hangouts with Katerina.

This dynamic continued for months, with her suddenly ‚Äúmeeting Katerina‚Äù almost daily. Coincidentally, around the time she met this new friend group in June, we began couples therapy‚Äîa suggestion she‚Äôd made, and one we could finally afford with both of us working good jobs. She also started taking anti-anxiety meds. Yet, despite the sessions, she never mentioned Shev or our growing issues until that pivotal session on September 24th where we confronted the issues of jealousy and hurt she felt. By August, only two months into her ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with Shev, their relationship had become sexual, with her taking photos of herself with him in his car, and his hands deep up her thighs, into her dress, as they drove together to an elegant concert. It was here the emotional gulf between us only widened faster and it felt like nothing I did to help our marriage was having any effect. I was so confused and scared.

I discovered her affair in the worst possible way. On October 3rd, while going through photos on **my own phone**, I was revisiting moments from our recent trip to Calgary (September 27th-29th, 2024), where we celebrated my grandfather‚Äôs 86th birthday and paid a photographer to capture family photos. To my horror, I stumbled upon explicit photos and videos she‚Äôd been sending Shev, along with seemingly happy, intimate moments of them together, with several of him touching her, and also them in bed together. Somehow, she‚Äôd accidentally sent them to me as well over the past few months. Seeing those photos‚Äîespecially the ones where they looked genuinely close and in love‚Äîleft me shattered. It felt like she‚Äôd been living a double life right in front of me, one the warm and nurturing wife, the other the cold and deceitful nymphomaniac. It felt like an out-of-body experience where I couldn‚Äôt tell what was real anymore and the skin on my body felt numb, like a plastic mask. Without those photos, I would have never believed it, I trusted her so completely, and the truth was too far from¬† my reality. In that moment, I realized that every story she told me about spending time with ‚ÄúKaterina‚Äù had actually been with Shev. That for months, so much was obvious, but I was being played as a chump.

I kept the information to myself for about week, feeling a part of me wear away each day as the weight of the secret took its toll. I thought couples therapy would be our best hope‚Äîa calm and accepting environment where we might work things out. So I waited. The day after our third anniversary (October 9th, 2024), on October 10th, I finally confronted her during our session, pouring everything into a heartfelt letter. I admitted my regrets for the things she blamed me for, and then confessed that I knew about the affair‚Äîthat I was angry and deeply hurt. It was such an overwhelming moment for me that I even passed out. When I came to, I finished the letter, telling her that I would forgive her if she chose to stay, that I was still committed to our vows. I even quoted Stitch (yes I used the Stitch voice too)‚Äîher favorite movie‚Äîhoping his words about Ohana would reach her. But she barely reacted, showing almost no emotion. She admitted that she had already planned to leave that night without saying a word, leaving me with the blame of a failed marriage‚Äîa decision she‚Äôd made with her Therapist, even before our trip to Calgary in September for family photos and my grandpa‚Äôs 86th. She listened, eventually saying she ""needed time to think"" and would stay for now. Later that evening, we talked more, cried in each other's arms, and connected an even deeper level yet. It was both beautiful and hopeful, as if the barriers that had were separating us were finally falling away.

It was there she convinced me that our emotions were running too high and that a week apart was what we needed. She said she‚Äôd stay with a trusted friend, pack light, and it seemed like a reasonable compromise at the time. It was late, we continued to cry, and I told her I‚Äôd give her anything she needed, that we‚Äôd get through this. She whimpered like a wounded baby animal, apologizing, taking blame, and assuring me that this time apart was necessary for us. Then she pleaded with me‚Äîdon‚Äôt change the locks, don‚Äôt hide the spare key, don‚Äôt cancel our credit cards or drain her bank account. She sobbed that when she first moved here, I was all she had, and now that she feels she‚Äôs losing me, that the little money she has is **all** she has left. It was late, I was exhausted, but something in her words chilled me to the core.

The next morning, she mentioned that she‚Äôd be packing while I was at work. I told her I‚Äôd stay home, and she asked if it would be alright if her friend Katerina came by to help, since she‚Äôd be moving in with her. She reassured me that this was just to clear her mind for the next *30 days*‚Äîdespite having said the night before it would only be a week. This also went against what we discussed in therapy, where I had voiced concerns about her new friends, especially Katerina, who seemed biased against our marriage. I knew that her and her husband had been planning couples‚Äô events with my wife and Shev‚Äîincluding a hotel trip for four on October 27th as well as many concerts together. But with me being a 6-foot man and her only 5'3"", I agreed to let her friend come over, asking for my wife's assurances that Katerina would be respectful and friendly. The reality, however, was far different.

Watching them pack her things was an excruciating three hours. Katerina refused to acknowledge me, treating me as if I didn‚Äôt exist and even stating that she was intentionally being rude to me for what I‚Äôve done. I politely asked if they could speak in English, but Katerina brushed me off, saying she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk‚Äù and then began speaking a mile a minute in Russian to my wife. After nearly two hours, feeling desperate to understand what was happening, I started using Google Translate to catch pieces of their conversation. I didn‚Äôt to hide it; when my wife asked if I wanted to say something, I even said, ‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù and waved my phone to show her.

Through their conversation, I learned that my wife had been lying about her plans. She had told both me and our therapist that she‚Äôd move in with a mutual *trusted friend* if she left, but in reality, she still intended to live with Shev. Her friend even encouraged her to take as much as she could, saying she could just throw out whatever she didn‚Äôt want later, even though my wife had originally insisted on packing light. Her friend went as far as to say that, once she was settled with Shev, she didn‚Äôt need to show me anymore respect. She even bragged about stealing things from her own ex when she went through a breakup.

Despite her friend‚Äôs influence, my wife didn‚Äôt take everything. She mostly packed items that were clearly hers, though they briefly discussed taking things I had bought for the home or owned before, like measuring cups, pots, pans, power bars, dried pasta, drawer organizers‚Äîodd items to be concerned with. She even tried to take a Vitamix food processor attachment, despite not owning or taking the Vitamix. She told me she was leaving our wedding money, despite having already spent it. The money she was referring to was from a freelance gig I picked up. I stayed close during the move, partly so I wouldn‚Äôt later imagine something I lost was taken and partly to make sure they weren‚Äôt taking anything they shouldn‚Äôt. I had communicated this boundary to my wife beforehand, and while she felt uncomfortable with it, she ultimately agreed it was reasonable.

When my wife finally realized I‚Äôd been translating their conversation though, she broke down into a sobbing mess, refusing to look at me, constantly collapsing in tears, accusing me of breaching her privacy and trust. But looking back, I see now that her reaction was driven more by fear and shame that I‚Äôd uncovered something, not from any breach of trust. As she cried, her friend‚Äîright in my own bedroom‚Äîbegan lecturing me about how I was a disappointment, turning to my wife and saying, ‚ÄúSee, I told you!‚Äù as if to justify her earlier suspicions of hidden cameras and tracking devices. Seeing my wife‚Äôs distress, I felt drained, as if I were being painted as the villain. I was blinded to the reality of the situation, feeling as though I‚Äôd somehow hurt the person I cared about most, even though I was the one being betrayed.

After she left, I felt destroyed, catatonic. She never offered back the engagement ring I proposed with‚Äîa family heirloom from my aunt, who passed away from multiple sclerosis. Later, on October 15th, she casually informed me that she left half of it in a key bowl for me to find and had lost the other half (the main half), ‚Äúprobably in the couch,‚Äù that I should ‚Äúlook for it‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe find it.‚Äù But her leaving without even making a token offer of it back, planted the first seeds of resentment. Seeing this and how her friends treated me, hearing what they were saying, I understood that they had little concern for my well-being or our marriage.¬†

As she packed the last of her things, the hurt she felt over my translating their conversations weighed so heavily on her that she didn‚Äôt even say goodbye. She collapsed again in tears by the car, with her friend picking her up, and pushing her into the vehicle. She looked back at me with pain in her eyes, her face a wet mess of smeared makeup screwed with hate‚Äîa look that will haunt me forever.

Earlier that cold morning, as she packed, I finally called my mother to tell her what was happening. My wife hated that I confided in her, saying, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they going to hate me now? I thought you wanted me back and weren‚Äôt going to tell them.‚Äù But I needed support too!! Why could she share everything with her family while I couldn‚Äôt? Without hesitation, my mother took the first flight from Calgary, arriving the same night my wife walked out. She hit me with the cold, wet mop of reality, urging me to take care of everything I had neglected (locks, bank accounts, credit cards, eating, etc.). Around this time, I also reached out to a few friends and posted a less further along version of this story on Reddit‚Äôs marriage forum (now removed), where I received hundreds of supportive responses. Slowly, the fog of despair began to lift, and I finally saw what should have been obvious: she had stopped loving me. She betrayed me, and how could someone truly love another while stabbing them in the back? But even though I knew it, I wasn‚Äôt fully there to believe it yet.

The irony is hard to bear: Shev himself was once betrayed by a fianc√©e who left him for a friend only a few months before their wedding, something he still gets angry and (according to my wife) physically aggressive about. Yet, knowing the pain, he willingly did the same to me. When she first left after packing her things, I wanted to feel anger and be decisive, but instead, I felt guilt, shame, and confusion, as though I had somehow failed her, even though she was the one who betrayed me. She asked me not to tell close friends and family about the affair in case she decided to come back‚Äîa possibility she claimed was greater than ‚Äú50/50.‚Äù I kept wondering if I could have done more: listened better, spent less time planning and more time in the present, pushed for more therapy. That night before she left, she even listed a dozen things she‚Äôd want me to change if she stayed, but by then, it was too late. She had made up her mind. I still don‚Äôt know what the point of that was.

My wife claimed she‚Äôd be gone for only 30 days to ‚Äúregroup,‚Äù taking us into mid-November. She has a ton of stuff here still but refuses to contribute to November‚Äôs rent. My mother, a boss, without asking surprised me by packing most of it up while she stayed with me. Meanwhile, I was still covering my wife's phone bill, and she‚Äôd racked up $2,800 on our shared credit card, both due on October 15th. Trying to keep things honest and open, I called her on the 15th to discuss the payments. Instead of understanding, she chastised me for being ‚Äútoo professional‚Äù and ‚Äútoo cold,‚Äù insisting we didn‚Äôt need to act like strangers just because we were taking some time apart. This was also the first time we‚Äôd spoken since she saw me translating her conversation while moving. She dismissed that moment as ‚Äúno big deal,‚Äù saying it wasn‚Äôt worth discussing because she and her friend were ‚Äújust on their periods‚Äù and that I should stop dwelling on it and not turn it into something it wasn‚Äôt.

After we addressed the finances, she agreed to pay off the card, even covering my portion of the phone bill because I had covered it all the months prior. I tried to end the call there, but she kept pulling me back in with questions and comments. She mentioned she‚Äôd spent the entire long weekend in the hospital recovering from a stomach flu‚Äîthough I could see in her bank account that she had been shopping at Crate & Barrel and at Starbucks all weekend. I didn‚Äôt confront her about it; I just wanted the conversation to end, but I got drawn in emotionally. Eventually, she said something affectionate, and in my pain, I responded, ‚Äúf\*\*ck‚Ä¶ you are so easy to talk to‚Ä¶ I missed this.‚Äù But all she heard was ‚Äúf\*\*ck you,‚Äù and she broke down in tears, asking how I could be so cruel. Later, she texted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no big deal; don‚Äôt worry, just a misunderstanding.‚Äù The next day (Oct. 16), she messaged me again in a cold, business-professional tone about her day. I haven‚Äôt responded since. And, exactly one week after our anniversary on the 17th, she sent me a photo of us together at our final anniversary dinner, making silly faces, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms and the warmth of fading happiness. Seeing this image made me numb, and in the days since I felt absolutely ruined again.

Looking back, I now see that our marriage wasn‚Äôt the fairy tale I believed it to be. It was riddled with manipulation and small tantrums over the years, each one slowly chipping away at me until I felt isolated from my friends and family. It was like she was all I had left, and no matter what I did, nothing was ever enough. I realize now that I contributed to this dynamic by letting her hurt and jealousy over my friend Jessica fester without addressing it directly or collaboratively, and by not establishing clear boundaries. But in the end, whether she intentional or not, she played the victim of her own affair‚Äî*that I had wronged her*‚Äîyet a victim of what!? This was the life she chose; nothing was taken from her. She‚Äôs done plenty to me and I didn‚Äôt cheat on her. As these realizations set in, I remembered the cold, sinking feeling I had when she begged me not to take her money. It was one of the most confusing and hurtful things she ever said to me because it made me see that she didn't truly care about me or our marriage‚Äîthat the small amount of money she had was more important to her than everything we had built together over three years. I would have given anything to make it work, but she wasn‚Äôt willing to give anything at all.

On October 16th, she messaged me saying she was doing ‚Äúa lot of therapy‚Äù and planned to ‚Äúheal as fast as possible.‚Äù She even asked if I‚Äôd want to join her family in Russia over New Year‚Äôs but added it might be difficult to get me a visa this late. My thoughts: so, why mention it at all? Anytime I tried to share my own pain, she always found a way to make it about herself. When I told her how I had broken down in tears at work the day before I confronted her, she chastised me, asking why I‚Äôd bring it up if I knew it would only hurt her.

I am beginning to understand now that, with affairs, there are really only two options: Reconciliation or Divorce. As much as I‚Äôd hoped for reconciliation, I‚Äôm starting to see her in a different light‚Äîas a brat who has never truly heard the word ‚Äúno,‚Äù a child who runs away when things get tough instead of working through them. How could I expect her to choose the difficult path of rebuilding our marriage when something new, easy, and exciting was already waiting for her, even if it did look like a potato? But knowing is still far from accepting...

When I first wrote this, I was consumed with guilt and sorrow, feeling like I‚Äôd lost the love and life we built because of something *I did*. That grief morphed into anger‚Äîa rage so deep it made me shake and cry from the core of my being‚Äîthat rage turned to a numbness, a feeling of disconnectedness or being out of body‚Äîand now I am back to sorrow and loss. I have had nightmares almost every night since the discovery and have seldom slept more than 2-4 hours in a night. I worked so hard for the life we had, and it was *cheated* from me. I see families with children and ache, knowing I‚Äôve missed out, and it will be years before I have the chance to get to that point again. The pain feels endless; I‚Äôm exhausted, sleepless, tormented by nightmares of him with her‚Äîscrewing my wife in front of me, **in my bed**, then smashing my head into a wall as she laughs. I‚Äôve lost 25 pounds since this started (five in just the past few days).

Part of me still wants her back still, and part of me just wants her to be genuinely happy. But there‚Äôs another part of me that wants for her to feel the pain she‚Äôs caused me. I think about telling her workplace what she‚Äôs been doing, showing them the days she spent with Shev on road trips or in the line at Warehouse sales while claiming to be ‚Äúworking from home.‚Äù I imagine revealing the truth to her father, a conservative ex-fighter pilot‚Äîshowing him that his ‚Äúperfect and only daughter‚Äù betrayed her marriage and the values he raised her in. That she was sleeping with me as well as another man outside our marriage at the same time. But I know that would be going too far, right? I know doing that would make me look crazy. I sure feel crazy right now‚Äînot know what to accept or believe.

In the end, I still want her happiness‚Äîeven if that means she builds a life without me. I want to move on, but I don‚Äôt know how. Some might easily assume this was all immigration fraud, but I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs the case. Her actions, to me, speak of someone deeply homesick‚Äîlike a restless child, spoiled by comfort and never hearing no, chasing after fleeting thrills. She is torn between the familiar world she left behind and the stable life we built together, clinging to whatever spark of excitement catches her eye, never content for long. When the storms of life came‚Äîand they were gentle storms‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt stand firm. Instead, she fled, running from the very things that demanded her growth. Strangely enough, it was this same wild-eyed wonder that made me fall in love with her in the first place.

Since my last post, I‚Äôve read *Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life* by Tracy Schorn, and it has had a major impact, helping me move from grief to anger and a step forward. I have also been with my personal therapist through this all (I actually started seeing him the same week I met my wife).

Though I ask it less now, I can still hear the words in my mind‚Ä¶ Where did I go wrong? What could I have done differently? What if I caught it sooner? Why am I so stupid!? Is it because of my money? Should I have confronted him directly instead of her? Am I unlovable? And most importantly‚Äîhow do I move forward while missing a piece of me, and can I?

On October 22nd, we start weekly couples therapy, and part of me can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîwhy? What is her end game here? She‚Äôs already shown she‚Äôs willing to lie, not just to me but to our therapist, and it feels like she‚Äôs rubbing it in my face. I feel like I‚Äôm being strung along, jumping through hoops like a dog performing tricks just to keep the peace, or so I don't have enough time to feel anger for what she did. Has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to reconcile, or should I just accept the inevitable and move on with my life? I am actively trying to exercise no communication.

So, finding a decent coffee maker is crucial, and that‚Äôs where the Gevi 4-Cup Coffee Maker comes in‚Äîa little machine that punches above its weight.

I've tried more coffee makers than I care to admit, and the Gevi keeps impressing me. It's simple, compact, and gets the job done without acting like it‚Äôs on a mission to Mars. No confusing buttons, no ""smart"" features to overcomplicate your groggy mornings. Just one switch, and you‚Äôre on your way to caffeinated glory.

What I like most? It‚Äôs got a ""Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause"" thing‚Äîfancy way of saying if you‚Äôre impatient like me, you can sneak a cup mid-brew without making a mess. Honestly, it‚Äôs been a lifesaver for those ‚ÄúI can't even‚Äù mornings. Also, it‚Äôs eco-friendly with a reusable filter, so I save a bit on paper filters. It fits anywhere‚Äîmy tiny apartment kitchen approves.

The downsides? Yeah, it's not for the big coffee parties. Four small cups at a time means if you‚Äôre serving a crowd, you‚Äôll be brewing a few rounds. And it's not going to win over the coffee nerds with its lack of advanced settings‚Äîno grind size options or any of that jazz. But for most of us regular folks who just need a good cup without the fuss, it works. It's like that reliable friend who always shows up, no drama.

Price-wise, it's under $30, which is a steal considering it actually works well, and I haven‚Äôt had to curse at it yet. There‚Äôs pricier stuff out there that offers more features, sure, but this one hits the sweet spot between affordability and quality.

So, if you‚Äôre after a quick, no-BS coffee maker that just does the job, the Gevi 4-Cup is worth a look.",1,1729440781.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False
