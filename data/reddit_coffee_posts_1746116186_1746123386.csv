He's about one year older than me (i'm in second grade, he's in third), we have PE classes together and we sometimes have classes next to each other. Thinking of him has been keeping me up at night for months. I literally can't stop thinking about him. I even did a first move.

 Once during PE, when we weren't doing anything and his friends were not near I approached him. I told him that he's pretty and his haircut really fits his face. He smiled and thanked me and since then, I really wanted to talk to him again. 

In my class there is a girl who's friends with him and from her i know that he's (probably) not dating anyone right now, not gay and rather kind. 

Today when I was talking with my older sister about him, she told me to ask him out on a walk or coffee and I would love to do that. The issue is that i'm quite awkward and don't know how to approach him. I don't know what to say and when to do that, since he's usually with his friends. And if i'll somehow ask him out, what if i'll mess everything up? I'm a huge yapper, i literally have so much to say. Some people hate it and just ignore me after finding out how much i can talk and text. I don't want him to ignore me.

Should i even try to ask him out? And what should i say? When i should do that? What if my constant talking will annoy him?

1kcfka4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcfka4,new to the game 🥰,"hello everyone!! this is my 2 week update between pics 1 and 2!

the short of it:
• 36 gallons (bought it with the stand on marketplace)
• fluval 407 (came w the tank wee)
• no CO2
• running lights close to the dimmest setting 12-7PM
• flourish & flourish potassium 2x per week
• have a big spiky driftwood soaking for the back left! gonna move the anubia to the back-middle kinda peeking out from the right of the big java fern

the long of it:
my friend found a totally abandoned goldfish in a house he was emptying for work, and i had a gruelling 3 or so months of doing everything i could to heal this fish... ultimately after all the treatments money can buy failed to see him improve i decided the humane thing was to euthanize him. it was so sad!!!! pic 3 is the last pic i have of the poor thing. long live pingo!!!!!!

that was the start of my aquarium journey and here we are :) i could have just sold it all off but i want to keep pingo's memory alive (although i will likely never choose a goldfish myself)

stocking:
• 8 neo shrimps (started with 12 but we know how that goes...)
• 1 nerite snail (although you'd never know it)
• some hitchhiker bladder snails (under control for now, i move em to their own little jar-quarium when i can snatch em)
• 13 CPDs and 6 melini corys in quarantine
• plan is to get white cloud mountain minnows, maybe chili rasboras or rasbora erythromycin - i love tiny fish. 
• gonna get 10 more cherry shrimp from my pal with a thriving colony. 
• and maybe some otos once the tank is more mature!

plants:
(wish me luck because im in quebec and my LFS sells with either latin or french names)
• java fern
• anubias - i think the big ine is afzelii and the small one café (coffee?)
• dwarf hair grass in the front there
• slightly bigger grass is dwarf sagittaria
• vallisneria spiralis is the spirally grass
• little guy with leaves is a small bacopa i think?
• vallisneria tall in the back
• lots of elodia (which i LOVE and grows FAST)
• big leafy guy is echinodorus ocelot i believe
• all the rocks are gobi, and ive got a cholla with moss on the right there

OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS for both plants and animals!!! definitely just in the grow out process for the next few months but would love to dream about it anyway.... thanks for being here!!!!

This is what I follow myself and what neither my parents or school helped me understand or realize about something that is the vital root of every human.

First there's 3 main category of nutrients, each having a direct effect on yourself.

Protein
Carbohydrate
Fat 

Learning that is already extremely valuable for you, because you might only eat most of your food and get only one of those nutrients, creating imbalance and deficiency. 

Yes, those are on every packet of food, but I doubt many people understand deeply what those names hide behind them.

We human consume calories everyday, even in a bed doing nothing but browsing internet, so if you have bad eating habits, you see how fast everything can get VERY bad? 

You're in deficiency, eating let say only carbs, and you don't cover the number of calories needed by your body each day, this could be an example.

Or maybe you're eating lots of fat in one meal, this will lead to inflammation, and that inflammation can and will travel all the way to your brain causing depression, mood swing, anxiety you name it, this is scientifically proved!

The quantity of calories of each meal is important too, because that could trigger insulin issues, and making you tired every time.

Some hindsight that I've come to with all the time available for us!

While human evolved, which happen over hundred of thousands of years, did they had the easy life we have? could they grab a drink, get a pizza from a fridge? Well of course not.

All this to say that everyone heard and many already tried ""fasting"" for a long time, but that's not just a fancy word or another trend, it's a straight proof by science, called ""autophagy"", well I bet your school teachers never told you this one? Yes, your body have a function that recycle and clean your entire body after a certain time without eating, there's only one problem, can you remember the last time you didn't eat for more than just 16 hours? For most of you, probably never happen.

We are literally left in ignorance about this, which seems to me like something vital that should be brought to everyone attention. I guess not consuming enough must be a problem somehow.

I personally try to do it when I feel like it, it's also a balance between not being too hard and going another extreme, but remember that, life was hunting and finding food before, which triggered all kind of substances in ourself, and we just don't do it anymore, but our system and brain are still from that era!

Another piece of knowledge, some food can interact and enhance the way your body use nutrients, and some of them will do the opposite.

Vitamin C can help absorb the iron from non-animal source.
Vitamin D can help with calcium.
If you drink coffee during a meal, the iron from non-animal source wont be used properly because of coffee, so if you're vegan or vegetarian, think twice.",5,1746122865.0,hikikomori,0,1.0,False

1kcfeiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1kcfeiz/fixed_my_credit_myself_got_approved_for_20kheres/,fixed my credit myself & got approved for $20k...here’s how,"so a few months ago my credit was basically a dumpster fire. collections, late payments, dumb stuff from years ago just sitting there like it paid rent or something. couldn't even get approved for a $500 card, let alone a decent loan.

i kept seeing posts about fixing your own credit, but thought it was just one of those internet rabbit holes where you end up with 46 tabs open and zero results. finally said screw it. gave myself a weekend, some coffee, and a grudge against transunion.

turns out, it's not that complicated.

first, i pulled all 3 reports. you can get them free from annualcreditreport.com. i made a list of all the negative stuff: who reported it, when, what type of account, all that. looked sketchier than a used car lot at midnight.

then i sent out disputes. real ones. not those generic “this isn’t mine” templates. i used specific language, quoted some u.s. code (they gotta report accurately under 15 usc §1681). politely told them to prove it or remove it. fun fact: they have 30 days to respond or it’s gotta come off.

the secret sauce? i staggered the disputes. didn’t send them all at once. did like 2 or 3 at a time every couple weeks. why? because credit bureaus use automated systems, and if you blast them all at once they flag it as “frivolous.” yep. like they get to call you frivolous. lol.

about 45 days in, 3 accounts were gone. poof. another 2 got marked “updated,” which really just meant “can’t confirm but don’t wanna admit it.” i pushed again. sent another letter. they gave up. gone. the last one took some work. sent a debt validation letter straight to the collector, and surprise—no response. another delete.

not gonna lie, i kinda got addicted. refreshing credit karma like it was stock x or something. score started jumping like a kid on pixy stix.

fast forward to now. score went from 578 to 707 in about 90 days. still not perfect, but way less embarrassing. started getting credit card offers again. even walked into wells fargo just to test the waters. asked about a personal loan, half expecting them to laugh.

they didn’t. they smiled. ran my app. approved me for $20k on the spot. i almost dropped my phone.

used some of it to pay off high-interest stuff. the rest went to savings and treating myself to a used car that doesn’t scream “college dropout energy.”

if you're curious, i found some free dispute tools [here](https://creditrescored.com) that made the process easier. no guru nonsense. just solid info and templates. helped me keep everything organized without needing to talk to anyone on the phone (thank god).

anyway, if you're stuck in credit hell, there’s hope. just takes some effort, some patience, and a healthy disrespect for bad reporting practices.

82kg, cutting with 1400–1600 kcal/day + 110–140g protein. Daily training (resistance + swimming), decent sleep. Hit a plateau. Diet is mostly whole foods + whey + creatine. Looking for feedback on meal timing, food choices, or calorie tweaks. Smoothie tips welcome too!

———

Hey folks,

I’m currently at 82kg and on a fat-loss + muscle retention journey. My daily intake is around 1400–1600 kcal with 110–140g protein consistently. I train daily (resistance + swimming) and sleep 7–8 hours. Progress has been good but I’ve hit a bit of a plateau recently.

Here’s what my diet roughly looks like:

• Morning (empty stomach): Water, soaked seeds • Pre-workout: Sweet potato + black coffee • Post-workout: Whey isolate + creatine (currently using Rule 1 and MuscleBlaze raw mix) • Meal 1: 100g dry chana/rajma/moong dal before boiling • Lunch: Yogurt (12g protein), salad, fruits • Evening: Coffee or peanuts • Dinner: 200g paneer sautéed + veggies • Pre-bed: Whey isolate

Supplements: • Creatine • Whey protein (2 scoops/day max)

Macros feel on point but wondering if I should tweak the meal timing, food sources, or drop cals slightly to break the stagnation. I’m also exploring smoothie ideas using unflavored isolate with berries or coffee.

Would love to hear suggestions from folks who’ve gone through a similar fat-loss + muscle preservation phase. Anything you’d tweak?",2,1746122725.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False
1kcfcdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kcfcdn/aitah_for_telling_a_customer_to_wear_her/,AITAH for telling a customer to wear her daughter’s shoes back in a restaurant?,"I been working part time at Saizeriya SG for the past 5 years. And I can safely tell you why you should never join F&B as your first part-time job, even for the money. Psa. I earn 15/hr on normal days, and 30/hr for public holidays. 

Just earlier today during lunch peak hour, it was just me and another full timer manning the whole outside floor - bringing customers in, clearing plates and cleaning tables. We are incredibly understaffed with a long 40 minutes waiting queue outside. 

I was doing my usual checks on the Drink Bar orders (because some people try to cheat their way out of $2.90 unlimited drink bars) and I saw 2 adults (at table 47) drinking hot coffee but only 1 drink bar was registered. So I told them that I saw them drinking and that I’ll add another drink bar in. They consented and I added it in - Strike 1. 

Later, when I was doing encashment for the table beside them (table 46), table 46 actually informed me that the table 47 child’s shoes were off her legs and were placed in between their tables. So naturally, as it is a restaurant, Saizeriya doesn’t allow shoes to be taken off. I told the mother to tell her daughter to wear her shoe. She looked pissed but ultimately did so - Strike 2.

Later on, a few customers came up to me to inform me that the child keeps walking around the aisle and that it’s dangerous as she is blocking people’s way when they are holding hot drinks. So I told her mother “please tell your daughter to stop walking around unsupervised.” SHE. WAS. PISSED. 


Needless to say, I got horribly shouted and pointed at during payment time. She shouted at me, asking me how could I have the gall to command her daughter to stop walking around and to wear her shoes. HELLO ITSNT IT COMMON SENSE TO NOT REMOVES SHOES IN A RESTAURANT! With a finger jutting in my face “Where is your nametag? HUH! WHERE. IS. YOUR. NAMETAG.” BRUH IM LITERALLY JUST A PART TIMER GUYS, I DONT DESERVE THIS!


I went in to call my manager, explain the situation before coming back to that customer. She was shouting about how I had to audacity to command her daughter to wear shoes, and that it was horrible customer service to do so. “This is a family establishment and I am a regular customer. How can you be so rude to me?!?”

And then my manager explained to her that shoes aren’t allowed to be taken off. She shouted back “THE FLOOR WAS WET!” WDYM THE FLOOR WAS WET. YOU WERE LITERALLY BROUGHT IN AT OPENING TIME. THE FLOOR WAS DRY WHEN I BROUGHT YOU IN. 

Im very sure her daughter spilled water but they were embarrassed to admit it. Hence, they didn’t tell me about it, even when I told the mother about the shoe removal thing. Honestly, they could’ve just told me “So sorry, my child spilled water so she took off her shoe. Can you mop it up for me?” And I’ll gladly do so. But no, she didn’t and now’s she’s shouting at me and my manager for it. 


And when my manager told her “you could have told me staff about it and we’ll gladly mop it up for you.” I am absolutely astonished about what she said next. A. 30+ year old women by the way. 

She said with her fingers pointing at me “HOW ABOUT YOU STOP COMMANDING PEOPLE AROUND AND BE MORE USEFUL HERE! GO MOP IT UP!” With all the hand gestures and how
What. In. The. World. How can someone feel so entitled when they’re already dining at a restaurant with no service charge and gst. For context, the most expensive pasta we have here is only $7.90 and the cheapest is $4.50. 

5 years working and usually, I’ll get shouted at a little at most. This lady right here  was acting absolutely psychotic. Like, who are YOU to command me like that! Absolutely insane. 


Needless to say, I was so shocked, horrified that I just stood there, in shock. I went into the kitchen and just stayed there until my manager came back in. EVEN MY MANAGER HAD RED EYES! 

My manager tried to console me, saying that some parents are really defensive of their children and to not take it to heart. 


But I’ve been so traumatised by this that 12 hours after the incident happened, I am still barely processing what happened. 


Needless to say, this was my last straw and I have just turned in my notice to quit in end June/July. ",1,1746122661.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Sometimes life keeps putting you in the same cycle until you finally wake up and choose yourself, that’s what I did. After years of burnout, people-pleasing, and emotional weight, literally and figuratively, I’ve started over. And now, I’m looking to build real connections and expand my community.

I’ve never had many friends outside of work, honestly, none, and I’m realizing how much I crave real connection. In December 2022, I began a journey back to myself. I lost 220 pounds in just over a year, and while I hit my goal weight by January 2024, I was feeling weak. So I shifted gears and became what I lovingly call a health nut, lifting, running, kickboxing, mountain biking, hiking, paddle board, swimming, all of it. But the weight gain was never just about food. It was trauma, shame, and years of silence. So I left my corporate job a year ago and went all-in on healing, physically, mentally, emotionally.

The past year has brought some huge life changes, including a relationship ending, and now I’m walking a path I never expected. But I’m here, grounded in truth and weirdly hopeful, open to what’s next.

I’m looking for friends who are emotionally aware, grounded, open-minded, and love to laugh. Friends who want to hike, mountain bike, paddleboard, kick back with coffee, talk about weird alien theories, or just play some Nintendo Switch and chill. I love ancient civilizations, astrology, tarot, space stuff, and deep convos about the universe. But I’m also here for protein shakes, Spartan races, music always playing, and cookies, any sweat treat really! 

If any of that sounds like your vibe, message me. I’d love to chat and maybe build something real. Local is awesome (I’m in Washington), but I’m open to friends from anywhere.

Let’s be weird, honest, and human together.

1kcfa6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kcfa6b/my_bf_30m_cancelled_our_international_trip_on_me/,My BF (30M) cancelled our international trip on me (26F),"
Me (26F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for little over a year. I thought that everything was under control for him financially despite the fact he was laid off for 4 months last year and for a few months a year before we met. He never let on that anything was wrong, I figured he was fine because he had unemployment checks and does a few side gigs that bring in enough to survive on.
 
He has been my other half since we got together. He’s acted as a provider, a gentleman, sends me money for coffee nails dinner random shopping so I thought all was well for him.

This all came crashing down Monday when he tells me his car has been repossessed. I was shocked. I had no idea he was over 3 months behind on payments and they took the car from outside my apartment. He’s now facing having to pay back the rest of the amount left on the car (40K) 

Ok… I know we have a trip that we’re supposed to leave for this Friday. It’s an international trip but a work trip for him that we were planning to make a trip out of. He insisted on paying for everything despite my offering to help with some things. I tell him maybe we should cancel, he already had insurance for every flight and I think for hotels too. He seems shocked by the idea. 

2 days later, last night, he comes over. He ends up confessing to me that apart from the car, he’s swimming in debt (50k) not including student loans and not what he may potentially owe on the car. This is purely discretionary spending over the past 3 years and 2 layoffs. His rent hasn’t been paid in 3 months and he’s now facing EVICTION. I don’t understand where the moneys going which is a big concern. 

I’m devastated that he waited until 2 days before we leave for our trip when he knew he was financially crumbling. I’m devastated that it took so long for him to tell me the truth until he’s literally been back into a corner and physically cannot lie anymore or else he’s facing eviction on top of a repossession. 

I technically ended things last night, saying this is too much for me, but I don’t know if I can stay gone. What would you do, would you stay gone? Would you work on it?",3,1746122513.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

1kcf9ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kcf9ak/small_water_softener_consistently_salty_after_a/,Small water softener consistently salty after a regen,"I have a small manual water softener that I use at my coffee shop for the espresso machine. It more or less ""came with the building"" when we moved into the space and needed some cleanup before it was ready to go. I initially dumped a huge amount of orange junk out of it that filled most of the tank. Then I added 1kg of salt to it and did a nice long regen. For two weeks it worked fine, then I went to do another regen on it since I was advised to do so every two weeks or so. That's when my trouble started.

I dumped out a small amount of what I assumed was residue/waste from the hard-water exchange then did my 1kg of salt again. I did a 1-2 hour long regen until I no longer tasted salt and hooked things back up. Since then, every morning the softener water tastes very salty, and I have to do a short ""purge"" on it to flush the salty water out. It will be fine all day as it is in use, but when it sits overnight, the salty taste comes back.

I've included pictures of the softener, including the inside of the tank. I do not know what manufacturer or model it is, only that it seems to be the kind of softener specifically used in coffee shops. It only has the one tank and is not intended to be part of a multi-stage system.

Now I cry when I butter the toast wrong. Hello.,"I wasn’t even supposed to be here today. Not, like, HERE on Reddit, the land of haunted dad jokes and poetic anxiety. 

I was supposed to be out there. Doing life. Working. Laughing. Getting irrationally mad at people who say “expresso.” Instead I got concussed by a broken shower door, a failed experiment with gravity, and introduced to the concept of “physical brain damage.”

That was November 2024. It's now May 2025. I still don’t know what version of myself is going to wake up on any given day. Sometimes I’m almost me. Sometimes I’m a grief-stricken sea sponge with good internet. Most days I’m just buffering like a 28.8k modem but your mom keeps picking up the phone...

They call it Post-Concussive Syndrome. I call it a full-body haunting where my ghost still pays taxes and rent while somehow still fully experiencing the agonizing pain of death.

I quit Facebook soon after the fall happened. Too much noise. Too many arguments. Too many people pretending everything’s fine while the world’s on fire. Honestly, it helped with the depression, and with reducing screen time. But now there’s this hole where human connection used to be. And I don’t know how to fill it without also breaking open entirely in public.

I’m home all day, every day. I don't see friends. I don't talk to adults. My body is in a chair or in bed hiding from sunlight, and my brain is doing amateur shadow puppets on the wall of my skull. 

I wait for my wife and kids to come home so I can try to be him again: Dad. The husband. The version of me that isn't constantly one loud noise away from snapping or sobbing or both.

And sometimes I am him. Moments where the old me pops out with a witty joke or a well timed pun. And sometimes I’m the grief-sponge again. Angry that I’m not better. Scared that this IS better.

I don’t really have a great day-to-day life or routine.. Not much for a support system outside the immediate family. Not in the real-life, drop-by-with-coffee-and-a-hug kind of way. So here I am. On Reddit. Saying out loud what I usually only whisper into the carpet: I’m broken. But I’m still here. Still weird. Still showing up in scattered Scrabble pieces, sometimes even forming thoughts. 

If you’re here too, somewhere between tragic and hysterical, lost and oddly sparkly, I see you. You’re my people.",1,1746122410.0,TerminalWhispers,0,1.0,False

You know the one. 🤔 You're powering through your day and suddenly, you're heavier than a loaf of bread after Thanksgiving dinner. Your eyelids have other plans, and all the coffee in the world can't shake that mid-afternoon haze.

A few weeks ago, I found myself in this daily slump, resorting to caffeine and sugary snacks. (Sound familiar?) But here’s a twist—scientists say cortisol, the stress hormone, could be whispering ""nap time"" to your brain! Intrigued, I went down the rabbit hole and stumbled upon something peculiar yet tantalizing: **a 2-minute breathing technique** to outwit the slump and reboot energy levels. 🚀🌱 Who knew something so simple could be effective, right?

**Here's what I did for 7 days, and spoiler alert, it was a game-changer:**

1. **Set the Scene:** I took a quick break from my desk—sometimes just stepping outside or by a window. Sunlight does wonders, trust me! 🌞
   
2. **The Breathing Technique:**
   - **Inhale deeply** through your nose for 4 seconds. Imagine you're pulling in vibrant energy.
   - **Hold** that breath for 7 seconds. Savor it like that first bite of your favorite dessert. 😋
   - **Exhale slowly** through your mouth for 8 seconds, letting go of stress and fatigue. Like deflating one of those inflatable couches—slooooowly. 🛋️

3. **Repeat thrice** to make it a full 2-minute energy booster!

Did it work? Oh, you bet! By day 3, the ritual felt like a quick vacation inside my busy day. My mind was clearer, I wasn’t reaching for that third coffee, and productivity levels soared like they had wings. 🦅

Not to get all science-y, but research backs this up! Controlled breathing lowers cortisol, combating that zonked-out feeling. 🙌

**Honestly, I was skeptical** at first. I mean, could something as mundane as breathing transform my day? Turns out, sometimes it just takes a little oxygen magic to turn things around. Ever tried something like this or have your own tricks to banish the slump?

Reflecting back, it seems crazy that I ignored such a simple solution for so long. It’s almost funny how we often complicate the simple stuff, huh?

Does anyone else have their go-to strategies for staying alert? Would love to hear what you guys do to keep the slump at bay. 🧠✨",1,1746122400.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

He's probably one year older than me (i'm in second grade, he's in third), we have PE classes together and we sometimes have classes next to each other. Thinking of him has been keeping me up at night for months. I literally can't stop thinking about him. I even did a first move.

 Once during PE, when we weren't doing anything and his friends were not near I approached him. I told him that he's pretty and his haircut really fits his face. He smiled and thanked me and since then, I really wanted to talk to him again. 

In my class there is a girl who's friends with him and from her i know that he's (probably) not dating anyone right now, not gay and rather kind. 

Today when I was talking with my older sister about him, she told me to ask him out on a walk or coffee and I would love to do that. The issue is that i'm quite awkward and don't know how to approach him. I don't know what to say and when to do that, since he's usually with his friends. And if i'll somehow ask him out, what if i'll mess everything up? I'm a huge yapper, i literally have so much to say. Some people hate it and just ignore me after finding out how much i can talk and text. I don't want him to ignore me.

Should i even try to ask him out? And what should i say? When i should do that? What if my constant talking will annoy him?

1kcf7r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kcf7r8/explore_the_ghuc100_ultrasonic_retainer_cleaner/,Explore the GH-UC100 Ultrasonic Retainer Cleaner review is it worth the hype?,"Testing out the New Greathouse GH-UC100 Dental Ultrasonic Retainer Cleaner has been an interesting journey. As someone who uses dental appliances daily, I've been searching for a way to clean them more effectively without relying solely on manual scrubbing. This little machine has been in my bathroom for weeks now, and I’ve gathered plenty of thoughts to share.

**A Modern and User-Friendly Design**

The first thing that caught my attention was its compact size and sleek build. Barely bigger than a coffee mug at 5.98 x 5.08 x 5.08 inches, it slides easily onto my bathroom countertop without taking up too much space. Its simple and elegant design makes it blend seamlessly with other appliances. The digital timer on top is a great addition—it keeps me informed of the cleaning process without having to hover around. It’s simple enough that even my tech-challenged father could figure it out on the first go.

**Dual Cleaning Modes: Perfect for My Daily Needs**

The dual cleaning modes have been a game changer. One mode lasts five minutes for when I’m rushing to work and need a quick clean for my retainers. Then there’s the longer, 10-minute mode that utilizes ultrasonic pulse cleaning. This mode alternates between two seconds of cleaning and a one-second pause, which, according to the manual, optimizes the cavitation cleaning effect. I tried this with an old retainer that hadn’t been used in a while, and I was amazed at how fresh it looked afterward.

**Key Benefits:**

- Ultrasonic vibrations reach tough-to-clean spots on retainers, dentures, and even tiny jewelry crevices.
- Compact design makes it ideal for small bathrooms or travel.
- A digital countdown timer simplifies monitoring.

**UV Light for Extra Hygiene**

What sets this cleaner apart is the integrated UV-light feature. It’s not something I initially thought I’d need, but the four 254nm UV lamps provide an added layer of cleanliness by tackling bacteria and odors. I’ve noticed a significant reduction in unpleasant smells from my retainers, and the devices actually feel cleaner to the touch. Pairing this with occasional cleaning tablets has yielded sparkling results, though do note the machine doesn’t include any tablets itself.

**Super Quiet and Travel-Friendly**

If you’ve ever used an old ultrasonic cleaner, you know how annoyingly loud they can be. This one, thankfully, operates at less than 45dB, which is quieter than most conversations. I’ve run it during early mornings with no complaints from my roommate. The 200mL capacity means I can clean even my bulkier dental appliances without jamming them in awkwardly. Plus, its portability makes it easy to pack for trips—important when you’re someone who values hygiene on the go.

**Positives:**

- Low noise ensures a distraction-free experience.  
- The 200mL capacity easily accommodates larger items.  
- Portable size makes it convenient for travel.  

**Potential Shortcomings**

Of course, not everything about the cleaner is sunshine and rainbows. The most notable issue is the lack of included cleaning tablets. While the device works fine without them, stubborn stains or odors are harder to remove unless you pair it with tablets. There’s also a minor learning curve when adjusting to the two cleaning modes, especially for first-time users. Another thing I noticed is that items with textured surfaces, like old toothbrush heads, may need a quick rinse after cleaning—the ultrasonic waves don’t always dislodge every tiny spot of grime.

**Negatives:**

- Cleaning tablets aren’t included, which limits its immediate effectiveness on tough residues.  
- Dual-mode selection might confuse newbies.  
- Some items may require additional rinsing.

**Rival Brands in the Market**

I've tested a few alternatives before landing on this cleaner, such as the well-known Magnasonic and ProSonic models. While both competitors offer similar ultrasonic cleaning functions, they tend to be bulkier and louder. Magnasonic’s cleaner, for instance, has a robust build and works well for jewelry, but it lacks the UV sanitization option. ProSonic is lightweight but falls short on build quality, making it less durable for long-term usage.

Compared to these, the GH-UC100 strikes the right balance, with its UV-light feature being the standout edge. The digital countdown, quiet operation, and user-friendly design make it a great investment for dental appliance wearers. However, if raw ultrasonic cleaning power is your primary concern, Magnasonic might still hold the edge.

**Worth Every Penny?**

For its price and the features it offers, this ultrasonic cleaner feels like it delivers solid value. Cheaper models often lack dual modes, UV lights, or a clear digital interface. On the other hand, higher-end units may offer all these features but at double or triple the cost. Unless you’re dealing with industrial-level dental cleaning needs, this product balances high performance and affordability quite well.

It more or less ""came with the building"" when we moved into the space and needed some cleanup before it was ready to go. I initially dumped a huge amount of orange junk out of it that filled most of the tank. Then I added 1kg of salt to it and did a nice long regen. For two weeks it worked fine, then I went to do another regen on it since I was advised to do so every two weeks or so. That's when my trouble started.

I dumped out a small amount of what I assumed was residue/waste from the hard-water exchange then did my 1kg of salt again. I did a 1-2 hour long regen until I no longer tasted salt and hooked things back up. Since then, every morning the softener water tastes very salty, and I have to do a short ""purge"" on it to flush the salty water out. It will be fine all day as it is in use, but when it sits overnight, the salty taste comes back.

I've included pictures of the softener, including the inside of the tank. I do not know what manufacturer or model it is, only that it seems to be the kind of softener specifically used in coffee shops. It only has the one tank and is not intended to be part of a multi-stage system.

Before that, I only had the occasional heartburn after a very heavy or fatty meal, but very rarely.  It has literally been non-stop since December.

It started as an episode in the middle of the night that had me thinking I was having a heart attack.  Intense chest pressure, cold sweats, stomach and esophagus on fire, dizzy, feeling doomy, etc.  I had a full cardiac workup that showed no issues and was advised to start omeprazole OTC to see if that helped.  I was having these attacks multiple nights a week regardless of diet - I was eating very bland food.  I also began to have reflux and regurgitation during the day, along with stomach burning most of the time as well.  I cut out coffee, spicy food, onions, garlic, all things known to be triggers for GERD.

I tried taking omeprazole OTC, that didn't work.  My PCP put me on pantoprazole, which seemed to help a bit at first, but after a couple of weeks it stopped having any effect.  Doubled the dose, no dice.  I was referred to a GI doc who scheduled an EGD and put me on Voquezna 10 mg.  Voquezna is helping a bit more than the pantoprazole was, but I'm still having pretty bad symptoms most of the time - it's rare that I wake up and have 0 issues during the day, regardless of diet.  

I just had the EGD on Tuesday, and aside from an irregular Z-line, there were no findings.  They took biopsies to evaluate for Celiac, EOE, Barrett's, and H pylori.  I'm petrified those are all going to come back clear and I'll be stuck just dealing with this forever.  The GI doc said they would double my dose of Voquezna if the pathology comes back clear.

It’s been like a year seen we officially met and it’s so cold between us for no reason?? 

I’m not that good at small talk, and I don’t want to come off as weird or anything. Like what do I do? Ask if he wants to go out for coffee? I don’t want him to think I’m asking him out on a date. I mean he’s cute but I legitimately just want a new friend. 

Unfortunately our jobs are so different, so there isn’t a lot of cross over, meaning I don’t have any indirect ways of seeking him out without just seeing him once in a while, and every time we do see each other, it’s really quick awkward glances and smiles and then poof gone. I really hope he doesn’t think I’m weird or something. Should I just let it go?

Words cannot physically describe how genuinely and utterly appalled I am by the appearance, the presentation and the facilities at UAL Camberwell. If you don’t wanna read my full complaint and all of my thoughts, you can stop here: don’t waste your time with this campus. 

Before I sort of get started I wanna put a disclaimer that this isn’t meant to offend ANYBODY. If you are a current student and really enjoy studying at Camberwell I’m extremely happy for you and hope that you’re able to pursue a rife career. For those of you unsure and looking to attend Camberwell, I firmly, firmly, FIRMLY suggest you read this whole post before making a decision that you will regret. 

If you had a different experience to me or feel differently, please state! I understand that I’m being quite negative in this post. I’m only really posting this so students who were unable to attend can read it and gain a better understanding. 

I’d even go so far as to say don’t bother with UAL as a whole. I wouldn’t even entertain the idea had I visited the University sooner. Their staff are rude, their admissions team are useless, their students are miserable, their facilities are tiny and poor and the expenses are beyond in comparison to what you’re getting. You may have better luck on another campus but with the way they treat and fund Camberwell, I just physically cannot see how any of their other campuses could be remotely any better. 

I’m gonna kinda do this in an order and start with the actual appearance of the University and then move onto the other points. 

Also a fair warning it’s going to sound like I’m repeating myself a LOT in this post so I’m very sorry in advance! 

My girlfriend tagged along with me for the offer holder day yesterday. For us it was a 5 hour journey both ways. The event started 1pm and was due to finish at 5:30 but it was literally so bad that we left come 3PM!!! 

I’m still a little upset that I travelled all that way for an offer holder ceremony just to leave within the first 3 hours. I guess I could’ve stayed longer but due to the miserable atmosphere I knew within the first five minutes that this was a waste of time. I was so certain I would be attending this September and I was literally so excited. I’m devastated tbh. It was really, REALLY that bad. 

We entered the foundation building about 10 minutes early. This is where we saw their ‘cafeteria’ which consisted of a tiny, filthy coffee bar, 3 tiny tables and 4 chairs. 

There was a tiny dove painting on the wall which was literally the ONLY PIECE OF ARTWORK I saw displayed in the ENTIRE BUILDING. 

They didn’t appear to serve food and only served donuts and cakes. This isn’t a bad thing as Universities tend to do this but when you consider that this is the ONLY cafeteria within the foundation building it certainly isn’t the best compared to other Universities. It’s worse than all the ones I’ve ever visited before. There was mould in the corner by the fireplace and it reeked of damp. Just the smell there made me feel sick, I can’t imagine actually eating in there.

The state of the ‘cafeteria’ (if you can even call it that. It was the size of a shoebox. I am not exaggerating.) wouldn’t be so bad if the Camberwell campus was located, well, outside of Camberwell…there were very VERY little places to eat in the surrounding area except for a takeaway Chinese store and a kebab store way further on up. I likely missed a few things but after searching for somewhere to eat before the event for a full blown hour I found no coffee shops and no cafes…which also means that there is absolutely NOWHERE to work or study outside of the University or outside of the student accommodation. 

This wouldn’t be a problem if there were appropriate facilities within the campus (There aren’t any by the way.) My girlfriend told me that on the tour there WAS a study / working space in the ‘main’ building, but even then she said it was small, bare and looked nothing like the pictures we viewed online. She also said there was another small cafeteria and a pretty nice looking courtyard in the main building, but again, compared to other Universities that’s literally nothing. 

This is the first University building I’ve ever been to where there’s just nothing inside. The second me and my gf stepped inside it was miserable. Horrifically miserable. Bare. Depressing. A science department would’ve been more colourful. Genuinely. The walls were bare and white washed and the paint was cracking and peeling off. I don’t care if it’s an old building, it’s an ART BUILDING, yet they refuse to display any kind of work or create any kind of atmosphere to make you feel welcome. They don’t appear proud of their students nor do they seem to care for what people are able to create.

This may sound a little hollow but in terms of its appearance it’s downright fucking ugly. I knew it looks bad in the photos but it is 20x worse in person. You have a massive square with a texture akin to a rotten memory foam pillow and then the old Victorian building which looks a little better on the OUTSIDE, but the inside is full of damp, an extremely foul odour, peeling paint and cracks EVERYWHERE. The surrounding area is also trashy and scruffy. I feel really mean saying that but I’m trying to be as transparent as possible. If you’re looking for the aesthetic student life…do a 180 and run in the opposite direction LMFAO. 

We were brought upstairs to watch a video. We were made to watch it on repeat 5 times. Nothing special. They kept grating on and on about how they thrive off of a ‘community’ and ‘student body’ which obviously doesn’t exist. 

They also kept claiming that they thrive off of Camberwell itself and how ‘artistic’ the area is. This isn’t true. There wasn’t a single statue or fountain or mural…the streets were equally as miserable as the University. The only source of inspiration you’re getting in Camberwell is at the train station— I’m sure you’ll feel much better after buying a ticket into Camden. It makes me feel so sad.

 They don’t assign group projects either. They also didn’t go over the course specification whatsoever (although it IS already seriously lacking online), they didn’t go over any potential topics or projects or themes— they vaguely said that it’s ‘student lead’ and ‘gives more freedom to prepare students for the real world’ which was absolutely utter bullshit and code for ‘we don’t really provide any structure and you’re expected to arrange all your own projects if you actually want a portfolio’. 

There are also zero societies. They briefly mentioned some clubs, but that’s it. It seems like if you go here it may be difficult to build a social circle, and to me this was kinda proved by the attitude of the student ambassadors. Absolutely no hate or disregard to these poor students, but they were just not very friendly and also didn’t seem to know eachother at all. I guess this can’t really prove much but as a first impression it’s definitely stuck. 

It IS important to note that as a UAL student you CAN enter the other University campus’ like Central Saint Martins, however you aren’t allowed to use the facilities. They don’t mention this on the website at all. Seems a bit pointless to travel all that way to a decent campus when you can’t even use half their stuff.

Some more crucial information that they missed out online is that they charge you for every single material you use. This was just one of the very important pieces of information not stated on their website or within the information they’re presumably supposed to send to you. 

They don’t send you ANY information btw, anybody here received an email? I sure didn’t! 

If you have specific questions I guess you can ask admissions, but I still firmly believe that a University SHOULD provide some general information.

This is partly why I was so desperate to go in person. There was no sort of pamphlet or poster or informative book or ANYTHING to provide information. They kept telling us to ‘look at the website online if we have any questions’. Lol? Wtf? I’ve literally travelled miles upon MILES and made the effort to show interest as a student and you’re gonna sit and fucking tell me to type in a link to find any sort of information myself online? 

This is so stupid considering that HALF of the stuff actually on the website ISNT TRUE!!!!!!!! 

A prime example is the illustration course because Jesus Christ, they seriously kept something so incredibly important out of the picture. 

For the possible illustration students: They’re FULLY relocating the actual illustration course from the big (it’s not even big, the facilities are equally as bad, there’s just more of them) Peckham building into the shitty old foundation building where the facilities are literally smaller than a shoebox AND ARE SHARED with ALL of the Camberwell Fine Art courses. Granted you ARE obviously allowed to go back to the main building to use any facilities but they stated that any lectures or workshops will be in the foundation building. They also stated that come 2026, the facilities will be moved from the main building into the foundation building. 

Not only do you have to BOOK and PAY to use any of their machinery (despite you attending an ART UNIVERSITY) you also have to compete with 5 other oversaturated courses battling for the same tiny tiny workshops with poor, barely working equipment. The metal workshop was absolutely covered in rust and grime. I know an art workshop is meant to be messy, but it wasn’t at all messy in the way it should’ve been. Did I forget to mention that the whole building is poorly maintained and full of damp? IM MENTIONING IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS SERIOUSLY. THAT. BAD. If I hadn’t attended this event, I would’ve never known. 

I’m not gonna bother trying to go into a lot detail on how wrong this is from a class standpoint as I believe it’s pretty self explanatory. Considering that half of the students are either international or not local to London, it costs a fortune to study there all together…in spite of this, the University just does not seem to fucking care. 

My girlfriend had asked if they offered any bursaries to cover material costs and they promptly answered ‘No, we don’t anymore unfortunately,’ despite stating on the website that they do. This place seems to be built upon lies and lies and lies and LIES! Again, if I hadn’t attended this event I would’ve blindly gone here in September and likely have been forced to drop out due to all these hidden excess costs. In my opinion it feels like they’re withholding crucial information intentionally. It just feels so scummy and feels like they’re not trying to help you whatsoever. 

I’m not at all saying that everything should be free, I’m just saying that if it isn’t free you NEED to be transparent and open about it so that students can deduce the pros and cons and make a genuine informed decision. I think that UAL is actually kinda self aware which is why they lack the initiative to make their students aware of any problems. 

It’s incredibly biassed towards their working class students who can’t afford to pay to use these facilities often. If your family doesn’t have a lot of money then you won’t be able to build a good portfolio despite going to a quote-on-quote ‘top art school’. This greatly stunts you and hinders your progress. Whereas if you DO have money you’ll actually be given the privilege of building a decent portfolio and have the ability to use whatever materials you want, whenever you want. What the fuck? Lmao.

The absolute disregard for their students and the utter lack of effort they put into both this event and Camberwell as a whole is disgusting. They say they thrive off of ‘community’, yet completely contradict themselves with the horrible state of the building and the complete and utter lack of team building. Their students barely spoke, none of them knew eachother despite being ‘student ambassadors’, half of the professors were nowhere to be found and when asked questions they were flippant and short. Again, I get I’m repeating myself but Jesus. 

Anyway, whilst my girlfriend was on the tour I went to a workshop with the other students. As we were walking over to the Peckham building I asked the ambassador how they honestly felt about Camberwell. She sort of gave me a general answer like ‘oh it’s good,’ but then I asked her again how she did feel honestly. She told me “It’s okay, but not the best really. Central Saint Martins is the favourite child, everyone knows CSM is the baby.” 

The entire event was monotone and boring. I genuinely feel so sorry for the poor poor people who travelled for hours and hours on FLIGHTS to see the University. Everyone seemed so disappointed and crestfallen. The parents were clearly very angry and frustrated with the lack of effort and the lack of information. Everyone was sort of faced with the fact that the journey was completely pointless. 

I guess to summarise: 
Zero effort was put into the event at all. 
Facilities were absolutely shocking. 
An art school with seemingly zero focus on art, zero student work on display, no colour, and an utterly miserable atmosphere. You have to pay per millimetre to use every single material, INCLUDING PAPER. Oh, but clay is free. The student ambassadors were well excited about that one considering they’re paying £290 a week for shared accommodation. It must be difficult doing a £10 food shop whilst having to pay per milligram of granite pencil shavings they’ve put on a £5 page. (I’m exaggerating a little here, but seriously come on.) 

Please listen to the current students and what they’re saying. The reviews are bad for a reason. THIS UNIVERSITY IS AWFUL. I made the mistake of disregarding the importance of what they have to say and blindly disagreed. ",0,1746121723.0,UAL,0,0.5,False

I'm used to there being a different cafe on every street corner in LA but it's mostly just Starbucks here (which sucks for actual coffee). My favorite cafes in LA were Philz and La La Land.

The main way I would find them would be through food delivery apps like Door Dash and Uber Eats so I could order ahead because lines would be terrible. However, here in Corona there's barely anything under coffee in those apps or on Google, so I've only been to those cafes because I've seen them in person.

Also for the record I do make coffee at home - but as someone in my early 20's who only goes out once every 2-3 weeks, I'm willing to spend $7 on a cup of coffee lol. Lord knows there's nothing else out here to spend money on lol.",0,1746121696.0,corona,1,0.5,False

1kcev1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcev1o,"Cycling from Alaska to Argentina: North Argentine Wine Country, Valles Calchaquíes y la Ruta 40","Argentina’s Ruta 40 is one of the longest roads in the world, starting at its northernmost border with Bolivia and ending more than 3,000 miles later on the southern fringes of Patagonia. It’s an epic bikepacking pilgrimage that I’d dreamt of since my very first transamerican journey 10 years prior.
 
Technically speaking, it’s easiest to push a little further east through San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, the provincial capital. Highways there are paved and with far less extreme elevation gains. But I opted for the adjacent valleys of Calchaquí instead. More gravel backroads. More quiet nights in the tent. Spirit nearing extinction. Hands dyed white by the chalky desert dust.
 
I stocked up on bread, water and kiwis in Susques before setting out over Abra del Acay, la Ruta 40’s highest mountain pass at +16,000 ft [4,895 m]. At last came the weep-worthy descent I’d waited months for, tracking sandy red washes into north Argentine wine country. I camped behind an abandoned hot spring for protection from the wind. Then a semi-collapsed stone shepherd’s hut with access to river water, treasuring each last drop of morning camp coffee with bitter slices of grapefruit. Cactus needles finally got the best of my back tire, but I welcomed the desert heat and its promise of the color green.

“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were.
 
My first glimpse of paradise was the colonial village of Cachi, cobblestone streets lined with willowy trees. I’d forgotten what the shade felt like. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert.

some background is that my bf had a work crush when we started dating.  he told me he would sexually fantasize about her to pass the time, and that it came down to him dating either her or me.  he told me some lies about her to make it sound more harmless, like that she worked in another department and he seldomly saw her.  I told him I was still uncomfortable with him fantasizing about her.  he ended up quitting that job the same weekend she did, he promises it was a coincidence since it was a stressful week at work.  we would still go into his old work sometimes since we had friends there, and I ended up asking a friend who worked there about her, and my friend revealed that she was the only female in his department and she was always hanging out with my bf.  that broke my trust, and I confronted him about it, and he was apologetic.  since then, he’s worked to change and be someone I can trust. he said he was a different man because he was addicted to porn at the time, he chose to quit it cold turkey, and hasn’t watched it in over a year now

when I heard that his new job had a reputation for being an all female workplace,I told him I was feeling a little apprehensive, and he promised me that I can trust him now.   I was walking our dog at the end of his shift once, so I waved to him and waited outside so we could head home together.  he told me that his coworker immediately suggested that they all start hugging and petting him and stuff to make me uncomfortable.  his supervisor shut it down before they started to actually do it.  but he told me today that this same supervisor (his trainer) has been teasing him about him liking a different girl there.  he had told her he likes the way that girl does a procedure better, and she was like “Oh, you like her?” and now it’s been a recurring joke for weeks 

When he told me about it, I asked him if he could shut it down.  I said it makes me uncomfortable because it doesn’t feel respectful to our relationship to act like he’s single and could like someone there.  I asked if he could just respond next time with something like, “No, I don’t like her, because I have a girlfriend.”  he said he does shut it down, he clarifies each time that he just likes how that girl does a procedure, he doesn’t like her.  I said that doesn’t seem to be shutting it down if they’ve teased him about her like 6 times since.  He got mad and said they were just joking and I need to chill.  I told him I was chill the first time when they were wanting to be weird in front of me, but I have a limit, and I don’t want them to set the tone at this new job that they tease the cute new guy like he’s single when he’s not.  He left back for work all mad, I’m mad too.  Neither of us yells or anything, but we’re just at odds about this 

Another thing his coworkers have been doing is baking sweets to share with him at work.  A girl bought him a coffee this morning.  I wouldn’t normally worry about those kinds of things, but given all the teasing, I’m starting to overthink them too.  They’re VERY friendly toward him, when they have a reputation for being mean in general.  They had a potluck yesterday, and instead of him asking me to bake something for it (I’m a great baker and bake all the time for potlucks at my work) he told me he had signed up to buy a potato salad.  We cook most of our food from scratch, so I asked why he’d buy something like he’s a single bachelor instead of asking me to make something.  It would have been a good opportunity for him to establish “yeah, my girlfriend made it” 

this isn’t a huge argument or a deal breaker or something. we’re just at odds, so I asked him if I could post it to reddit.

Then we’ll order drinks and do the normal get to know you small talk. I’ll try to joke around and some dates its much easier than others. I’ve had multiple dates last 2+ hours, it always lasts at least 1 hour. Sometimes if its going well near the end we start talking about other things we can do together. By the end, I always pay for the drinks and usually walk them home. We’ll hug at the end and then I say I’ll text you. I’ve probably done this 20-25 times. I’ve truly had some that I thought went great and see no reason why they wouldn’t want another. Laughing and smiling through the whole date. 

After I get back home I text saying I had a nice time, and usually they respond. Then I say would love to see you again assuming I want to go on another. Twice they have said definitely, only to ghost me or end it before actually doing the second date. Every other time they don’t respond after I say that or say they got more of a friend vibe. 

My main guess is that since I have a very poor self-image and confidence, I come off as desperate or seeking approval. If anyone has any books to read or coaches they know, let me know! I heard good things about a book called models.

Meanwhile at Keyun’s house. Keyun took out the soda with the snacks and bars. “Let’s see the news.” Keyun put the news while he grabbed the soda until he saw Mina, Kafka, Reno, Soshiro and Kikuro and smiled. “Not bad with all the strongest one.” The news muttered while Mina raised her hand and looked around the people.

“People and citizens. We’re trying to find the man with the mask that he used kaiju’s power of Kaiju No.8 but the man hide somewhere so he can stop the Kaiju nearby.” Keyun walked to the location as he swing around. “The unknown Kaiju’s power is still unknown and we can’t catch up to him or to the Kaiju.” The reporters wrote it on the paperclip, tablet and notebook while Keyun put his mask as he slowly lift the flare. “And when he shows up at a random place, we will find him if you tell us where he is.” Until they hear the green and blue flare at the sky while Keyun showed up. “There he is! Sir! Can we ask you a question!” Keyun ran as he jumped near the stage. “What the?!” Keyun slowly stood up and spoke.
“I’ll answer your question. After I finish your question I’ll talk with Hoshina.” Mina and the rest of them flinchedwhile Keyun pointed his hand to the reporter. “Are you a good or bad?” Keyun chuckled softly. “I am a good, next question.” The man raised his hand while he nodded. “Will you take their place to take Kaiju down?” Keyun sighed deeply. “I will not take every Kaiju because I’ll leave it near the Hoshina poeple near the Kaiju and the base except the place where there’s no Hoshina around the place of people.” They wrote it down and Mina asked him. “What power do you have?” Keyun grunted softly and used his right arm as he hit the sky out of nowhere.

“I Chu Yun. Will get your question so write it down.” They quickly wrote it down while Keyun walked with them. “Let’s go.” They walked with him while the guard held the casket as the people put the paper in it. “Let’s go back to the base.” The driver drove away while Keyun sighed. “That was awkward.” Kafka shouted as he panicked. “Says the one who showed up at the stage!” Reno hit Kafka’s head as he yelled at Reno. “Why did you hit me?!” Reno scoffed while he looked at Keyun. “He’ll be part of Hoshino.” Keyun ignored them until Mina gave him the letter. “This’ll be your mission and also following the rules of the base and Hoshino.” Keyun looked at it and saw Kaijus. “So you want me to train the new people how to fight Kaiju?” Mina snapped her finger while the guard brought the briefcase. “Of course we’ll pay you if you do it.” Keyun rushed her as he put one finger. “Five for training them. Seven for saving them. Eighth for hurting the Kaiju and one for lacking off or doesn’t know even if they don’t understand.” Mina took out the signature until Keyun gave her the paper. “My conditions and yours as well.” Mina scoffed as she gave the stuff to the guard as she wrote the paper and gave it to him. “That’s all?” Keyun nodded while they put the signature. “Also if you wonder what happened to the Kaiju. I use the Kaiju tracker but it only costs twelve dollars.” Mina sighed and Scott ran away while Reno, Soshino, Kafka and Kikuro.

“For the lady is free because I heard the news of the tragedy.” Thanked him as she sat down and scoff. “I’m okay with it. ”Keyun sighed as he sat in front of her. “Listen Kikuro. I had my parents but they tells us to look out for ourself sokeep that in mind that you have family from being part of Hoshimo even your father place and your mother’s advide.”  smiled while she thanked him. “No need, Kikuro. I have what I need for myself.” Keyun gave the guard as he paid him twice until Keyun gave him three while they went under the base. “We’re here. Let’s go to the traine.” They went to the room while Mina and Kikuro thanked him as they left untilHoshinosmiledand gave him the whistle and the siren.

“It’s your turn to learn so you can coached them.” Keyun twitched his eyebrows while he sighed. “Where is it at?” Reno and Kafka took him while Hoshino waved him goodbye. “There are two half. The first half if physical and second half is the wrost day formy first day that Hoshino said to me as I have my power disposed the kaijus. With suits.” Until Keyun stopped and smiled. “Now I get the reason why I saw both of you wearing itand the traines.” They got confused while Keyun went to the room while they locked him but Keyun didn’t care. “I just saw the note guys.” Keyun grunted as he played the video. Few minutes later at the Coach room. Keyun looked at the view as the traines do the warmup while he wrote a paper and opened to the other room.
“Hey. Are you done?” They saw no one as they went in. “He left a note.. He left huh?” Kafka panicked while Reno slapped him.

“The guards will give himthe radio to follow the instruction of the halves.” Keyuun walked towards them until Kikuro spoke. “Are you ditching the lesson?” Keyun soff as he looked at her. “So? Do you wanna bet or something?” Kikuro gave him the paper and pencil with the clipboard and the radio. “Follow the struction to coach them.” Keyun chuckled as he warmup his shoulder as he walked to the shadow. “I’m just warming up.” Keyun walked upstairs and went to the mic and sighed. “Listen up, newbies! You’ll be assigned partners in three to five people of each group to the second half and the first half is physic which of course running, ducking under the ropes, doing obstacles. And get warmed up in five minutes.” Keyun walked away and Kikuro sighed. “You really are dumb, aren’t you.” Keyun hit her gently as he looked around. “It wasn’t me. Anyway, I wanted to ask about that can I use the suit of what I’m wearing to show how to attack or using the equipment?” Kikuro took a breathed and hit him. “You really are dumb.” Keyun groaned as he looked at them as they looked at him.

“Kikuro is like my sister to me and do it again if you looked at me or someone if they talked to someone.” They groan and ran again while Keyun turned on the speaker. “If you’re done with everything, running and other stuff. Rest for a while as the rest of them finishing their last so you all can go to the second half.” Some of them ran faster. “Let’sgo the lastone but I wonder what’s in there..” Kikuro tapped her foot to the ground while he ran around until the guard spotted him as he put his arm to the other side and dropped the ball as he acted quickly. “Got him trying out but he almost looked.” Keyun grunted while Kikuro grabbed him. “Fine.. I’ll go to here then.” Keyun scoff as he looked at the drone. “There’s Kaijus in the box huh.” Keyun detected them with his system across the trees. “I guess they’re here. Hm..” Keyun walked towards them and put his thumbs waving behind his back as they rested. “Few of them showed up and some of them.” Until Keyun flinched as he felt the distance. “Not again.” Keyun grunted as he waved them to him as they followed him while he stepped away from them with the speaker. “Listen up everyone. This the second half of the test. This’ll be your last test so be careful of what’s inside when you dress up and then check on you and lastly to go in. Kikuro if you please.” Kikuro opened the door while he talked.

“This’ll be your test against them. So all you need to do is to dispose the Kaiju. Could you close the door Kikuro.” Kikuro grunted while he gave her the letter as she smirk and closed the door. “It’s that an invitation?” Keyun hit her arm gently while he walked to the direction. “It’s for everyone Kikuro.” They went as they saw the people of Hoshina. “Is that them?” Keyun looked around as he went in the room with Kikuro. “I guess we’ll wait.” Keyun clicked the button while the distance near the base expolded. “What was that noise?” Kikuro looked at the view until the machine whirred and slowly stopped. “Data complete.” Kikuro nodded while Kafka showed up. “Let’s go the test but before we all go out.. We need to put the suit on.” They quickly ran to the dress room while he laughed. “Let’swait for them so we can have a talk.” They sat down while Soshino walked towards them with coffee on the big plate. “I guess you have a balance.” Hoshino sat with them as they heard a mumbling voice through Hoshino while Keyun smiled with disgust. “I thought they wouldn’t bring living armor to this place.” Kaiju No.10 laughed as he looked at them. “I never thought a rare Kaiju would be here and a substitute? Hahahaha! That is funny for a human power to substitute for the newbies.” Keyun sighed as he hit him. “I guess so but yes. I have a rare one but Kafka has a rare one as well?” Kaiju No.10 sighed until he grunted.

“Got it. Now let’s talk about you. What’s your name mystery.” Keyun sighed as he twitched his eyebrow. “Segnu.” Hoshino gave a handshake until Keyun turned around while Kafka got confused. “What is it?” Keyun clicked the button as they heard the click. “What the? You had a button? And what did you do.” Keyun sat down and looked at the time. “It’s the Kaiju that Kafka met the first one but there’s some Kaijus around but far away.” Keyun sighed and gave them access. “Now that you know and have the location of the Kaiju. I can now get out and watch them even if I show up to them if they can’t do it or are distracted.” Keyun walked to them and walked out. “Let’s put up the monitor to see the situation.” Keyun sighed and clicked the button. “He better get hurt without disturbing the class.” Keyun walked to the wall until his arm reached to the door as it opened itself. “What the? Did they give me access or something? Anyway, Let’s go and warm up!” The door slowly closed and Kikuro smiled as she nodded at Kafka and fired at Keyun. “Uh?” Keyun dodged from the bomb, teasers, bullets, pencils and missiles as it followed him. Keyun ran to the wall as he walked on it. “What the?!” Keyun chuckled as he jumped to the wall and grabbed it while turning around and jumped away from the wall. The wall exploded while the machine whirred.

“You gotta be kidding me. No warm up before this!” Keyun ran to the edge as the missile quickly charged at him until the smoke showed up and exploded. Kikuro, Reno, Kafka, Soshino and Mina saw the monitor while the smoke slowly faded. “Did he die or did he survive?” Keyun grunted as he chuckled. “I’m pretty sure I’m alive.” They cheered him up while the other was surprised. “I don’t know what to say.” Keyun felt the Kaiju nearby as he yelled away from them. “Go get three if not then four of each group.” They form a group of three people while he gives their directions and gives them the logo. “The logo means that you’re the leader so lead the way to your groups and take the Kaiju down!” They went to their location. “Now start whenever you’re ready!” Keyun felt it again as he pressed a bunch of times as he walked to them. Keyun looked at them and saw the kaiju walking around, “Ha.. Dear Kaiju. You’re quite dead, aren’t you.” Keyun disappeared while the Kaiju looked around and showed up while the base saw him fighting the Kaiju. “Take this! 65%” Keyun breathed and threw his fist at the Kaiju and walked back as the Kaiju almost fell to the ground while he jumped on it. “75%” Keyun sighed and powered up with his power glowing. “What the? Is that the same thing that he did at the bank?” Keyun turned around while reaching the ground, he threw at it as the Kaiju’s head was destroyed near the legs.

“Whoo. That was quite a warmup.” Until he felt near the base. “Damn it. I’ll be back!” Keyune ran outside as the Kaiju stood in his way until he destroyed it and other Kaiju showed until it was pushed back. “Open the Kaiju path.” Keyun ran and jumped while texting Kakfa. “Uh? Oh. Sorry, I gotta go to the restroom.” Mina sighed with a smile. “He’s always like this.” Kafka took out the tracker and opened it to the side and took out the plastic covered with cotton. “Put the forehead between the sides.” Kafka put it on and it activated while the sound whirred and Keyun spoke. “Hey Kafka! Do you remember fighting the Kaiju?” Kafka nodded as he thought of it. “The first Kaiju was saving the little girl?” Keyun grunted and sighed as he put on the mask of Kaiju. “I mean your first time at the base training but joining.” Kafka snapped his finger and laughed. “The second Kaiju No.9. Wait what? What’s going on?” Until Keyun gave him a video call while Keyun recorded his and ran at the location. “You better look because Kaiju No.9. It's back.” Keyun jumped and threw at him within speed. “Uh? Gah! What the? Who are you?” Keyun chuckled while he clenched his fist. “I’m your enemy of all kinds.” Kaiju aim at him until Keyun vanished and Kaiju looked around until Keyun spoke behind him.

“You know you’re bad at aiming right?” Kaiju fired at him but he missed. “You miss me.” He grunted and talked while he fired at him. “You think you can stop me? You’re a human but no power like the previous age.” Keyun smiled and the sound beeps until it exploded. “Gah!.. Quit hiding and fight coward.” Keyun chuckled as he walked to him. “I never thought anyone but you saying the word but now you might regret.” Keyun dashed around him while he charged his suit. “Human are weak but you.. Are.. Annoying.” Keyun laughed and changed his position and hid while dashing around the empty place. “Now you’re staying away like a real coward!” Keyun laughed as he slowly reaching the button. “You’ll know when you hear the noise.” Kaiju flinched as he hear the noise. “That must the other one.” Until it exploded as he dodged it. The smoke slowly fade away and Kaiju breathed as his body got burned. “You really did plan it without telling me but you did before the explosion.” Kafka saw him from another place to another place and punched him. “Take this.” He looked at it until he got hit from behind. “Gah! Where are you, coward!” Keyun stopped as he grabbed the wall while he pulled the strings. “Huh? What the?! Gah!.” The arrows flew to Kaiju and stopped while the bomb launched at him.

“Really with that trick?” He aimed at the bombs until the arrows kept going. “You are a very annoying human!.” Keyun jumped with the arrows and smiled at him as he held grenades. “You gotta be kidding me.” Until it exploded while Keyun protected himself. “Ha.. Hahaha. I thought it would end but I guess you’ll learn slowly but it turned out that you learn fast!” Keyun blocked him and punched him. “Gah! What. Kind of. Power. Do you have.!” Kaiju dashed to him but instead he dashed to the roof and the ground over and over as he waited to attack. “Listen Kailu nine. You may know about me but there’s some that you don’t know.” Kaiju got confused until Keyun put his power within the suit.
“Ha..” Until Kaiju showed up behind his left shoulder and Keyun hit him. “Gah!! Damn the humans. I’ll show you the power of the previous Kaiju No.9.” Kaiju grunted as he transformed until Keyun charged and dashed as the Kaiju flinched and saw in front of him. “Too late!” Keyun grunts and keeps going while the Kaiju paint. “Let’s end this thing.” Kaiju walked away until Keyun sighed as the Kaiju clicked the button. “Uh? Oh oh.” Kaiju quickly protected himself until it exploded while the Kaiju fled away as the Kaijus went towards him until they were knocked out. “That’ll settle.” Kafka gasped until Keyun walked to the base.

“It’s okay Kafka. He won’t mess with you and everyone from you getting hurt because I have some suit that’ll have like mine.” Few minutes later at the Hoshina base. Keyun came back with a truck. “Hey. Where were you and what is that?” Keyun opened the trunk and they saw while Keyun put the sale. “It’ll cost fifthteen dollars for each suit and the items from the Kaiju blood as well the core that I fought the Kaiju of which you all know.” They all flinched as he showed them the picture. “Kaiju No.9.” Kafka, Hoshino, Reno and Kikuro took the suit and Keyun gave them the video. “See you tomorrow while you analyze the video.” Keyun sighed and walked home. The kids greeted him and greeted them back.
“Where are you going sir?” Keyun sighed and smiled. “I gotta go to bed to get some energy.” The kids nodded as he went to his room. “Ha.. What a stressful day.” Few months ago. Keyun walked around looking side to side as he took Kaiju’s blood. “Hmmm. Not bad for the Kaiju’s power. Anyway, See you with the other Kaijus.” Keyun walked to the right and hid as the Hoshina squad passed by and Keyun walked away. “Three down. More to go.” Keyun walked to the street and walked to the store. “Here’s the pay.” Keyun takes the rose as the manager thanked him. “Let’s go see an old friend.” Keyun walked to the Cafe as he rang the bell. “Going.” Keyun waited until Shuyen gasped.
“My friend. What can I get you? Oh.. Thank you Keyun. I owe you but coffee is on me.” Keyun thanked him and pointed to the menu as he nodded. “Got it but I’m glad to see you.” Keyun breathed as he saw the news of Kaiju and the comments were sent with confusion, anger, happiness and fear. “Here’s your coffee, Keyun.” Shuyen looked at the phone and chuckled. “I thought the news was them but the mystery of the person who did it and hid away.” Keyun sighed and put sugar, milk and mixed the cup. “By the way. Did they find out who it was?” Shuyen shook his head and gave him the picture. “But they see this symbol but they’ll search if anyone has the symbol.” Keyun breathed and took a sip.

“Anyway thank you but still. How’s your loved one.” Shuyen grunted and hit him gently. “You better not talk to her as she can hear you far away from here. So drink your coffee while waiting for your order.” Keyun drank the cup until the tracker beeps. “Huh? A strong signal.” Keyun put the note as he left the Cafe. “Where is the Kaiju at?” Keyun heard it beeping as he moved the tracker to left and right until the tracker beeps higher as he walked to the location. Until the Kaiju showed up with lines on the forehead, pointedly spikes behind his head, spikes with the shoulders, arms and behind the legs to toes.“Kaiju No.16. You’re in my debt for using my time to use my power!” Kaiju growled and ran in a flash while Keyun breathed and put Kaiju’s blood and power up and blocked it. “Ha. Not bad Kaiju. Let’s have some fun!” Kaiju ran as he ran like a gorilla and jumped as he raised his hands. “You’re a wild one. But not enough!” Keyun grunted and hit him while turning around like a tornado. “Grah.!” Kaiju growls until he loudly roared at Keyun while the people hear the roar. “Is that a Kaiju?! Hide everyone.” They hid in their place while Keyun put up higher percentages as he kept fighting. “Take that!” Kaiju grunted and saw blood.

“I guess you wanna kill me huh.” Keyun put on the headphones while Kaiju screeched as he ran towards it and jumped as he put all Kaiju’s blood and energy. “Goodbye. Kaiju.” Kaiju quickly punched Keyun until he killed him. “Ha.. Ha.. Ha… I gotta take some before getting caught.” Keyun chuckled and put it on the tubes and heard the alarm. “Crap. Gotta go. Wait. The truck.” Keyun broke the spikes on each body and left while they slowly showed up. “What happened this time.. A Kaiju.” Mina called Kafka, Reno, Hoshino and Kikiro. “Whoa.. Is this Kaiju No.16.” Mina nodded while Sohino took the picture and sent it to the researcher. “Now what do we do?” Mina looked at the Kaiju until she gasped.
“Kafka. Do you remember when you and Reno were safe from us, right? What’ll happen to that person like that.” Kafka flinched and looked at the Kaiju as he looked but saw nothing but blood outside the body until he saw missing spikes and kept looking and yelled at them. “Over here!” They ran to Kafka while they looked behind the Kaiju. “What is it?” Kafka pointed the spikes to the legs. “You see the spikes, right? Well look at the missing spikes.” Mina flinched and gasped. “Does it mean that person is using a weapon to make a Kaiju?” Kafka thought of it until he snapped his fingers. “I might think it’s a man, and he wouldn’t do it while he captures the thing.” Kafka was surprised as he took a picture.

“Bring it to us to research on the little Kaiju but I might think it’s a larva.” Mina put the name of transforming while they call the cleaners. Meanwhile at the Cafe. Keyun breathed and took a sip until Shuyen spoke behind him. “Where were you!” Keyun turned around and grabbed the table. “I was bringing items and some ice cream. See.” Shuyen sighed and gave him the check. “Take the food and call me if you need anything.” Keyun gave him tips and left Ice cream next to Shuyen as he left while he took the food. “What a weird thing for me.” Keyun walked to the bridge until he walked down under the bridge and put the food behind him while putting the other blood. “Let’s try a new power. Kaiju.! Go out!!” Until the ground rumbles like an earthquake while Keyun falls to the ground. “Oh oh. Gotta go.” Keyun took the food and ran to the shade as he stayed there until he heard someone. “Huh? Hello? Is anyone there? I’ll give you something that’ll interest you.” Until the door opened and Guyan talked. “Do you have something?” Until Keyun dashed in. “Hey! You can’t go in before showing me.” Keyun gave her the tubes of Kaiju’s blood and she gasped with a smile. “I’ll let you in often but was that noise?” Keyun used the power and threw the punch in twelve percent as he aimed at the paper stacking each other.

“What the? Give me whatever you have.” Keyun stopped her with his hand and gave her the bag as he walked to her monitors. “Is this yours?” Guyan scoffed with a smirk. “No but someone used to live here but now I live here.” Keyun looked around until he saw behind the monitor. “I guess he died in an accident.” Guyan sighed and grabbed the photo. “I never thought to see his face that he gave me home and comfort.” Keyun looked at the place to the walls with black covered with papers. “He was the inventor but a great master.” Ten years ago at Kagein’s home under the bridge. Kagein chuckled as he heard the door and opened and saw Guyan. “Well hello little one. What’s your name?” Guyan trembles while he chuckles. “Well I guess you’re freezing outside but come on in.” Guyan went into the room and the tremble stopped. “Sit in the chair if you please.” Guyan sat on the chair. “So.. What’s your name?” Guyan spoke to him while pouring warm chocolate in the cup and walked to her. “I’m Guyan and I’m thirteen.” Kagein smiled and sat next to her as he put his foot on his leg. “Pleasure to meet you Guyan. I’m Kagein the greatest inventor.” Guyan looked around as he turned on the machine.
“The machine used to power the room without using theirs so I used their water from the river but of course the water of the ocean or normal water.” Guyan saw the tanks as she touched it.

“I guess you’re surprised by me but there’s more. Even more than that.” Kagein pulled the curtain as he chuckled. “This is all my item and some experiment. Even if it works or fails.” Guyan walked to it until the system spoke while blocking her. “Do not enter without his permission.” Kagein sighed and gave her the necklace with the pass while the system let her go as she stepped away. “You may go in.” Guyan saw the robots standing with the tube while the others had black dust on each part of it and Guyan saw the curtain.
“What is it?” Kagein sighed and mumbled softly as he put the sticker of red. “That’ll be soon to see and know when I pass it to you and trust someone like me to you.” 

“But it’ll be two of us like brother and sister if you grow up like me.” Guyan spoke while little Guyan chuckled. “I used to hope that it’ll be the time in a few weeks or months but that day happened. Of the incident.” Few months later while they played around. “Let’s go to the park.” Kagein chuckled with a smile of joy. “You’ll be sick because of the food. Now let’s go home.” Little Guyan cheered as she raised her hands until the loud noise exploded away from them and Kagein thought of it and ran while holding her. “Kagein. What’s going on?” Kagein reached his home and let her go as he closed the door. “Where are you going!” Kagein took a deep breath and sighed as he called the robots to him and the suit. “Kagein. What’s that noise!” Until she saw him putting on the suit. “Sorry Guyan. That’ll be the last scene for me. So I’m sorry. Remember what I said. I pass it to you of trust and you pass it to someone but it’ll be two of us. Brother and sister.” The machine and the engine whirrs. “So goodbye Guyan.” Until he flew away while the robots followed him as she hit the door with anger and sadness. “Kagein! Kagein! Don’t go! Don’t leave me alone in this place. I need you..” The system slowly showed up as the machine whirrs.

“It’s okay, Guyan. It’ll be okay even if I'm here for you and bring him to cheer you up with his jokes.” Guyan slowly stopped and the system put the tissue under her eyes and wiped it.
“I promise you that you’ll leave me even if he's not here but he’s with me.” Until the system loses the static. “Uh? What’s going on?” Until the system shuts down and updates. “Uh? System?” Until Kagein spoke. “Hello Guyan.” Little Guyan shouted as she got scared. “It’s me but now that the system told me what happened to me a few days ago. I put the memories to the memory chip so I can talk to you while Asbla can talk to you.” The door opened and slowly spoke. “Hello Guyan. Now you know what happens in a twisted moment.” Guyan ran to him until he chuckled as she got hurt. “Now we are together.” Ten years later in the room Keyun sighed and chuckled.

“Now I get the thing. He works the machine with another one to make himself talk with you.” She nodded until he grabbed Keyun. “Let me show you something Keyun.” Keyun saw the curtain until he saw the watch as the watch has the name. “This is called Tachine but it needs some power like Kakfa or anyone or even more power in this country.” Keyun sighed as he looked at it. “I guess I do need advice.” Kagein looked at the time and sighed. “What is it?” .. “It’ll need to go back in time so they can’t forget and move on but the people might miss their family.” Keyun looked at it. “I’ll take care of it and do it for someone who is dying from illness.” Kagein chuckled with a smile. “You better save her or in time.” Keyun thanked him and left.
“Guyan. I have something to say but here’s the stuff.” Keyun took out the briefcase and put it on the table. “What is that?” Keyun opens it as the briefcase automatically cracking the code. “I have Kaiju’s skin, bone and blood, also this blueprint from making my suit but I made it myself.” Guyan gasped until she was concerned. “Don’t worry. I’ll help you when we’re done with a few of my suits for the heroes but a few of them even for you.” Guyan gasped with sparkly eyes. “If we do it. I will give it to you.” Guyan hugged him with joy. “Guyan. You’re like a sister to me even though he's still here as you’re older brother, even your dad.” Kagein flinched at what he said but thought of it.

“I might but i’ll think soon but now I’ll help both of you since you brought these.” Keyun chuckled softly with laughter. “Then we’ll work now.” Meanwhile they worked together. Keyun left them to rest as he walked to the town. “I wonder how they’re doing?” ",1,1746121218.0,Story_made,0,1.0,False

To this day, I feel that Archer Heights is trapped in the 1980s, but regions up north seem and look current. That being said, I would want to see some change in my neighborhood. We have a few eateries and local retailers, and we've noticed that intoxicated drivers are ramming into them as a result of higher speed limits and unsafe streets. I intend to visit some of these establishments and chat with the owners about alerting the alder people of our area and expressing their concerns and support for safer streets. However, I'd like to provide them with credible information about having safer streets, such as bike lanes, slower speed limits, bumps, and so on, and how these can generate more cash and more diverse crowd.

Does anyone know of any eateries, local shops, up north that have had their areas renovated with bike lanes, pedestrian islands, slower speed limits, etc.  and can provide me with their contact information or name of their business?

I greatly appreciate it!",4,1746121150.0,chibike,0,1.0,False

1kceoy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1kceoy7/reasons_i_dislike_messaging_on_old/,Reasons I dislike messaging on OLD,"I’ve seen complaints about women taking their time answering messages and maybe I have some insight.  My preference is to quickly arrange a casual meetup and THEN start messaging if there is a connection. I have encountered many men who panic and disappear when meeting up is discussed. In those cases I have wasted my time and efforts to communicate with someone who has no intensions of meeting. I also don’t like to give out too much info before I know that there is a connection for various reasons concerning safety and privacy. One of the main reasons is that I find it hard to send meaningful messages into the void, so to speak. I am a great conversationalist face to face and can write funny or emotional messages to those I know, but draw a blank when the recipient is a mystery to me.  I have also had men write nasty messages if I don’t answer right away. Please be patient. Some people might only respond at certain times of day or are very busy at the time for some reason. Those who are impatient give off vibes of not having a life. I do put in my profile that I prefer to meet quickly especially if the person is local. If there is distance involved it’s a different story.  I really like and enjoy meeting people so a coffee and a walk is fine with me. A meal would be fine too and I’m happy to split the bill. I’m going to try again this summer. Toronto has lots of interesting places to meet. I know that there are wonderful guys out there and probably many that get just as frustrated as the women I know by OLD. Oh and one piece of advice. Don’t send sexual messages or pics to women that you haven’t met. It doesn’t send out an appealing vibe. ",1,1746121081.0,DatingOverSixty,1,1.0,False
1kceowe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kceowe,"Cycling from Alaska to Patagonia: North Argentine Wine Country, Valles Calchaquíes y la Ruta 40","Argentina’s Ruta 40 is one of the longest roads in the world, starting at its northernmost border with Bolivia and ending more than 3,000 miles later on the southern fringes of Patagonia. It’s an epic bikepacking pilgrimage that I’d dreamt of since my very first transamerican journey 10 years prior.
 
Technically speaking, it’s easiest to push a little further east through San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, the provincial capital. Highways there are paved and with far less extreme elevation gains. But I opted for the adjacent valleys of Calchaquí instead. More gravel backroads. More quiet nights in the tent. Spirit nearing extinction. Hands dyed white by the chalky desert dust.
 
I stocked up on bread, water and kiwis in Susques before setting out over Abra del Acay, la Ruta 40’s highest mountain pass at +16,000 ft [4,895 m]. At last came the weep-worthy descent I’d waited months for, tracking sandy red washes into north Argentine wine country. I camped behind an abandoned hot spring for protection from the wind. Then a semi-collapsed stone shepherd’s hut with access to river water, treasuring each last drop of morning camp coffee with bitter slices of grapefruit. Cactus needles finally got the best of my back tire, but I welcomed the desert heat and its promise of the color green.

“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were.
 
My first glimpse of paradise was the colonial village of Cachi, cobblestone streets lined with willowy trees. I’d forgotten what the shade felt like. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More tired excavations for wild camp spots. More dry valleys of red wine country.",16,1746121077.0,gravelcycling,2,1.0,False
1kceoug,https://i.redd.it/p4gexkefi7ye1.jpeg,My preview review 4/26,"Finally wanted to get my thoughts on Epic Universe a few days out from my preview day. This might be long and rambling.  I’ll try and keep this fairly ride detail spoiler free. My wife and daughter were on a vacation elsewhere for the week that I couldn’t go to because of work, so I flew in Friday night alone and I was in Orlando a total of 31 hours touchdown to wheels up for this trip. Stayed at Dockside and check in about 12:30 AM Saturday morning. I asked what time busses start running to Epic and was told 9. In the morning I saw the line already started at 8 so I grabbed some to go food and coffee and got in the queue. Bus came at about 830, and took about 15 minutes. Security opened at 9 and we were in the park by 9:20 with a posted 11 AM opening/10 AM early entry. I booked it to Super Nintendo World and the Helios people were already funneling in. The escalators were down so we got rerouted to the stairs. Not quite the same grand reveal but it was still jaw dropping walking into the land.

I headed straight to Minecart Madness, which wasn’t open but they let us in the queue. We got the ride opening announcement at 9:47, and it took me about 30 minutes from there and I was along the back wall of the first indoor room of switchbacks. The ride itself was fun, but what is probably the biggest effect wasn’t working and I think that hurt the ride a lot. Still, it’s a decent family coaster and felt longer than the videos made it. Rating 8/10. After that, Bowser’s Challenge was down so I bought my Powerup band and got in line for Yoshi’s Adventure. They need to fix the bands so the QR code just takes you to the linking part of the app, I missed the first couple tap points trying to add it. The posted wait was 20, and I waited 24 minutes. Yoshi’s is very cute, but probably not worth much more time than I invested. Rating 6/10, 8/10 for kids. Also, as someone partially color blind, the shades of colors on the eggs did not match their buttons but not a big deal.

After Yoshi it was approaching 11, so I headed to Dark Universe and got in line for Monsters Unchained at 10:59, and started trying to a Battle at the Ministry virtual line spot. Got one in my “cart” but it was gone before I could check out. Same exact thing happened at the 3 Pm and 6 PM drops. I think they were even more limited than usual because even when entering the park we were told BatM wouldn’t be opening until 3. The Monsters ride started out by the fountain, but it only took about 10 minutes to get into Frankenstein Manor. After about a 10 minute down time in the first preshow, I got to the lockers at about 12:10 and it was about another 10-15 minutes from there to boarding, but I think that was still a bit backed up after the brief delay. I loved this ride, but it is chaos your first time through. There is too much to take in all at once, even with some effects, including the big finale animatronic being stationary. There is a “scene” however that is you just facing a curtain, and at the point that is in the ride it really feels like a bad pause. Still Rating 10/10.

I tried to get in Burning Blade at 1230, but the line was already out the door, so I went to Curse of the Werewolf. The test seat out front was down, so a TM walked me to the test seat on the load platform and then just put me on the ride. Probably saved me about 15 minutes from what I could se of the single riders line. This was probably my lease favorite of the coasters, it’s fun but the finale scene left a poor taste in my mouth. It just felt like an after thought. Rating 7/10.

I needed some food so I head to Oak and Star which was mostly empty even though it was like 12:50. Sat down, mobile ordered. They had my Freestyle cup to me in 3 minutes and food in 6. I liked the BBq, and all the sauces were ok to good, with the Harissa being the best. Portion size wasn’t great but if your used to an urban BBQ place its similar. The mango bread lived up to the hype. Ate fairly quickly and caught the end of a band performing Katie Perry and other pop stuff by Celestiki before heading over to Stardust racers.

This was the first test seat I was even borderline for. I’m 5’10, 275 broad shouldered. I was told it was actually easier to force the lap bar down on the ride then the test seat AND that they just received new bigger seats to add as a row on the trains, but they weren’t sure when they’d be installed. It took me about 20 min from the lockers to loading on the Green side. Man this coaster is smooth and with a lot of air. Soundtrack adds to it as does the racing aspect. Not as intense as Velocicoaster IMO, but just as fun. Rating 10/10.

After Stardust I went straight to Untrainable Dragon. Show was fun, not exactly what I was expecting, but the effects were great. Sit in the front half for the full effect. Good AC break for 20 minutes. Rating 8/10. When that was over I went to Fyre drill with a 10 min wait. It was fine, definitely worth a slightly longer wait, but I got soaked and no one else in my boat did. Just the way someone else fired. From what I could tell, sit on the left side if possible to stay dryer. Rating 7/10. After that, I tried to get into the 3 PM Cirque du Arcanus, but by the time I got there the line was for the 3:45 so I left and pretty much walked on to Stardust Racers Yellow with a 7 minute wait, immediately followed by Constellation Carousel which had a one cycle wait. This was super pleasant, absolutely gorgeous and a great distraction. Rating 8/10 if you can get on quickly.

I then headed back to Berk for Wing Gliders and I walked up just as they reopened the queue after a delay so I didn’t see a posted time, but it took me 50 minutes, and singles was closed. This ride was more than I thought. Think Slinkydog Dash with ride scenes. They do need to work on throughput though. Rating 7.5/10, probably a 9 or a 10 for kids. I did not fit in the test seat for Dragon Racers Rally, but I probably could have tried harder, and the Tm told me that I might still have more luck on the actual seats. Honestly it was what I cared about lease, since it really is an off the shelf ride, so I just went and got a snack. The PB&J mac and cheese cone was really good, but the cone is most of it and did not feel worth the $16 with the proportions of meat to mac to bread even if the cone itself was super tasty.

After this I had a good 45 minute delay trying to find my lost Airpods. TMs were super helpful and really went out of their way to look around where I knew I dropped the case and didn’t notice them fly out.  The Lost and Found system impressed me. While they didn’t have it when I went to report it up front, they found one by the end of the night and got it to me and found the other one overnight and are shipping it.

After this I went and played around with the Power Up band, collecting the keys to unlock the secret game and road Mario cart with a 25 minute wait that was posted at 50. This was much better than the original videos from when it opened in Japan made it look like. I loved the queue, this was probably my favorite one honestly, and the AR worked great for me even over glasses. Rating 8/10.

I then had to hightail it back to Ministry of Magic for the second to last Crique show and walked right in. The queue is massive for a show and lends credence to what I’ve hear is they want to run it almost continuously once the park opens. Show was definitely not what I expected at all and way more tied into the Potterverse than what I though was going to be a Circus style show. Preshow was excellent too. Rating 7/10. I tried to talk my way into the BatM single riders to no result, so at this point it was just re-riding and finally taking time to walk around Celestial Park and Darkmoor at night which are stunning. I got one more ride each on Stardust and Monsters at night and even though Monsters inside, its worth it to go t at night to both. Finished the night with the Vesuvius at Pizza Moon and it was disappointing. I thought the crust was supposed to be crisper, and it was a bit soggy. Might give them another change not right at closing.

Walked around a bit taking pictures on my way out and it really is just beautiful at night. Busses back could have been more efficient but its still previews so I’ll give that a pass.

So that was my day at Epic and I can’t wait to go back with my kid and family on May 22.",5,1746121073.0,UniversalOrlando,0,1.0,False

anw back to the story, last 2023 i had this weird encounters sa house ko. i moved out of my parents house a month ago pa lang and ive been seeing strange things sa bedroom ko. kapag patay yung ilaw, super dilim ng part sa likod ng door ko pag nakasara. gets niyo ba ko huhu basta yun. since i didn't grew up na duwag naman, wala akong pake and hindi ko siya masyadong pinansin. until may super long nails na nagtatry magreach sakin pag nakahiga ako (kasi malapit yung bed ko sa window) and kapag nangyayari yon, laging natutulog ako tapos magigising ako makikita ko yung nails tapos i cant move at all. idk what you call it, idk if malelabel ko ba siya as bangungot e gising naman ako.

dahil dyan, i spent most of my nights outside. bihira lang ako mapirmi sa bahay kapag gabi, lagi lang kapag nasa house mga friends ko. by the start of 2024, i met my current bf and don na rin ako nagstop na gumimik. nagstop na rin yung nails na nagrereach out sakin and hindi na madilim yung likod ng door. though there was one time na natutulog kami and i pointed sa likod ng door kung nasaan yung shadow and my bf saw it.

last, last night lang, i was doing the dishes and i felt like i had this brain fog idk its my first time having it. parang nandon ako pero wala ako don di ko ma explainnnn. also nagpapatay sindi yung ilaw ng cr na di ko naman pinansin kasi iniisip ko baka pundi na. i asked my bf if alam ba niyang nakalagay pa yung protective plastic nung diswashing paste. nasa cr siya non and i heard him say ""ano?"" tapos tumawa siya sa dulo. tumawa rin ako kasi iniisip ko alam niya siguro. paglabas niya ng cr, sabi ko bat ka tumatawa. hindi raw siya tumatawa, i heard him loud and clear na he was laughing. sabi ko baliktarin niya yung damit niya. he did and my mind cleared up, hindi na rin nagpapatay sindi yung ilaw. could be a coincidence, idk. tapos sinabihan ko siyang lagyan ng salt barrier yung door ng cr to which he did. wala nang nagcr samin after that incident. natulog na kami and kung bumangon man siya, malalaman ko. sa dibdib niya ako natutulog saka light sleeper ako. pagwake up namin ng morning, i noticed na wala na yung salt barrier sa bandang gitna.

earlier, kanina lang mga 12mn lumabas ako kasi gusto ko ng coffee sa 7/11. papunta pa lang ako, di pa ako nakakapagkape. i heard this voice of a child laughing kasi parang may park something before ka makarating ng 7/11 here. i played gregorian chant tapos nung pauwi na ko, di ko na kayang dumaan pa ulit don kaya umikot ako sa tabi ng hospital saka highway. feel ko nababaliw na ko hahahhahah help ",3,1746120898.0,phhorrorstories,0,1.0,False

I'm sorry if I make mistakes, as English is not my first language.

This begins when I was in my sophomore year in high school. At that time I had a close female friend, let's call her S, who was practically my best friend at the time. I have autism, so high school was a rough time for me when it came to having friends. We and our families had known each other for many years, but it was very recently that we began talking more and became close friends very fast. S was an amazing person and never judged me at all for my disorder. She also became my friend very fast just because of the sheer amount of patience she had with me and helped me get over my fear of interacting with people. However, I really developed feelings for her when she fought with her friends group making fun of me to defend me, and cut off contact from them. To not ruin our friendship, I kept those feelings to myself but continued to develop stronger feelings for her. Eventually, after the end term examinations of our Sophie year (a very big thing in our country), I confessed my feelings for her and she also said she really liked me, and we began dating. She was my first everything, my first time holding a girl's hand, my first kiss, my first everything. As teenage romance as it sounds, I honestly thought I'd be marrying her one day. 

  
Then covid hit, and the pandemic lockdown began. We had to spend our days locked up in our respective homes, and it honestly was one of the most unhappy phases of my life. We were also in the junior year of high school at that time, and the only saving grace for me were the regular video calls that we had every single night. Once we enter junior high, we begin preparing for our college entrance exams which is a very difficult exam, so there was a lot of stress and pressure already. The pandemic and the lockdown weren't helpful either. Then the most devastating news of my life reached me, when I heard that she caught covid and her condition was awful. Because of the lockdown, I wasn't even able to meet her for one last time before covid took her away. 



That sent me into a really bad spiral, and basically nothing mattered to me after that. I somehow entered college in my country after my senior year, and things were somewhat better because people were more accepting of me here, so the change of environment was somewhat good over here. Still, I hadn't processed her death at all, and honestly still haven't. I miss her dearly, and sometimes cry over all this. I often talk to her father as well, and even now text him once in a week to check up on him and stay connected.

  
As a direct consequence, I never dated anyone in college. I once had someone ask me out for coffee, but I politely refused her. In my sophomore year in college, I met M (F22) at a birthday party. I had texted her once or twice before as we shared a common class, but never talked to her in person. She had a very warm demeanor and a very friendly and welcoming personality. We ended up walking alone away from the party and talking for quite some time, with me walking her off to her dorm. Soon, we ended up texting each other pretty regularly, even over the semester break, and not a single day went by when we didn't have a phone call or a long text conversation. I felt nice talking to someone in a long time. When we came back to campus after the break, we met each other, and that's when M mentioned that she kind of liked me and had a crush on me. I did not know how to respond to that and got very flustered, and asked her for some time to think on it before giving her an answer. I was able to see that she was upset, but she agreed to it.

  
Here is the problem now. I feel I also like M to some extent, but I can never shake the feeling of loving S so dearly off of me. There are still nights when I cry to sleep over S, and M doesn't know about any of this, which is why I kept my feelings for M at bay. It has been 12 hours since she's asked me out, and I do not know what to do. Whenever I think of it, I feel like I'm betraying S and hurting her soul.

1kceja7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1kceja7/coffee_was_my_problem/,Coffee was my problem,"Just wanting to share my story for possible benefit to others. 

I’ve struggled with internal hemorrhoids for years including prolapse (highly annoying) and pretty severe bleeding. I’ve tried banding and over the counter and prescription suppositories, all of which provided some temporary relief. 

I’ve been on a long term trend of eating more whole foods and less cheese, which helped some but did not resolve. 

I did not want to get surgery because I felt as though I had an underlying condition and wanted to figure that out before surgery. 

I also have cold toes and fingers so I started reading up about raynauds. Turns out some people who quite caffeine get improvement for their raynauds because it is a circulatory issue and caffeine is a vasoconstrictor. 

So, I quite caffeine. A couple days of headaches. Didn’t notice a major improvement with raynauds but wow within a few days my bowel movements were no longer explosive particulate matter and they were like little normal logs. I eventually started back up on decaf and the BMs started being a little like they used to be (small pieces and coming out with some gas). So, I quite decaf, and now it’s all back to resolved!

My theory is that the acidity of the coffee (I typically drank it in the morning and I almost never eat breakfast so it was on an empty stomach) caused irritation and gas which leads to a much more violent exit of the BM. This, coupled with the vasoconstriction and internal spasms caused by caffeine caused my internal hems. 

TLDR: Optimizing whole food, minimizing cheese, minimizing processed food, and quitting coffee (including decaf) has basically completely resolved my years long struggle with internal hems. ",1,1746120697.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

Having tested the Capresso 117.05 Stainless Steel Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Machine EC50 extensively, one of the first things that caught my attention was its sleek and compact design. The black and stainless steel housing gives it a premium look, blending easily with my kitchen setup and even earning compliments during gatherings. Its sturdy yet lightweight construction makes relocating it a breeze, which is particularly handy for someone like me who enjoys rearranging countertops. The compact size doesn’t hog counter space, making it a smart choice for smaller kitchens or apartments.

**Impressive Brewing Performance**

This espresso machine delivers consistently good coffee quality, largely thanks to its 15-bar pump and stainless-steel-lined Thermoblock heating system. I’ve been spoiled by the rich crema it produces, elevating every cup of coffee I’ve brewed with it. Even when experimenting with different grind sizes from various coffee beans, it didn’t falter. It took me just a couple of tries to perfect the tamping and achieve café-worthy results. Knowing it works seamlessly with both pods and ground coffee is an added advantage, especially when hosting guests with varying preferences.  

**User-Friendly Features**

What stood out to me as a daily user is how approachable this machine is. The operation is manual but incredibly simple, with user-friendly buttons and indicators. The 42-ounce removable water tank allows uninterrupted brewing for three or four cups before needing a refill, perfect for mornings when the entire household craves espresso. Cleaning up feels like a breeze too—its self-locking filter holder and reusable filter mean less dependency on disposable items, making it a win for the eco-conscious like myself.

**Check [Capresso 117.05 EC50] price on Amazon.**

**Versatile Milk Frothing Options**

As someone who enjoys both cappuccinos and lattes, the high-pressure frother on this machine feels like a game-changer. It effortlessly frothed almond and oat milk, something I wasn’t sure it would handle well. The stainless steel wand is durable and easy to clean, maintaining its shine even after frequent use. Mornings have become significantly better with creamy latte art, and surprisingly, even my five-year-old niece enjoys watching the frothing process (though she gets plain hot chocolate).

**Favorable Attributes**

- Durable stainless-steel housing with a compact design.
- Built-in high-pressure frother for flawless cappuccinos and lattes.
- Works with pods and ground coffee for versatile brewing options.
- Produces excellent crema, enhancing espresso quality.
- Easy-to-clean reusable filter and self-locking filter holder.

**Negative Attributes**

- Limited vertical cup clearance; taller mugs require careful tilting.
- Small water reservoir, demanding frequent refills for heavy users.
- Pump noise might be bothersome in quiet environments.

**Competing Products**

When weighing options, I compared it to other semi-automatic espresso machines like the De’Longhi ECP3420. While the De’Longhi is quieter, I found its espresso weaker and less satisfying. In comparison, the Capresso 117.05 outshines with its ability to extract richer, more robust flavors. Cheaper models like Mr. Coffee often lack the stainless-steel build and durability this machine provides, making it worth the investment. However, premium brands like Breville with advanced features might appeal to those looking to spend upwards of $500, though in my experience, this machine holds its own quite well for its price range.

**Smart Spending**

For its feature set, the Capresso EC50 feels like a bargain. The price-to-quality ratio is excellent, giving more expensive machines stiff competition. It may not offer bells and whistles like touch screens or automatic milk frothers, but it gets the fundamentals absolutely right. Considering how much I’ve cut back on coffee shop expenses, the investment in this espresso maker feels incredibly well-justified.

1kcedu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kcedu2/would_i_be_wrong_for_not_wanting_my_friend_to/,Would I be wrong for not wanting my friend to bring her kids to my next event?,"So I (28F) have this friend (40F) who’s been supportive through some tough times, and I care a lot about her — but lately, I’ve been feeling drained. The problem is her kids. When she brings them to something, it becomes chaotic, and honestly, I’m just tired.

At my bridal shower, which was at my parents’ house, she asked to bring her kids because she had them that weekend. I said yes because I wanted her to be able to come, and they weren’t the only kids there as some of my cousins have kids. The other kids were well behaved, but her kids were super hyper and kept interrupting a trivia game my sister made about me and my husband. At one point, one of them shouted, “next question, why is my family divorced?” which made things kind of awkward. To her credit, my friend did gently step in and said, “that’s not the next question.” But later, her kids were running up and down the stairs and being really loud. My mom asked them to stop multiple times, but they ignored her. My friend stayed pretty hands-off the whole time. It bothered me because my family had put so much time and care into making the shower feel special.

Fast forward to my birthday. I wanted a chill evening: food, games, drinks and hot tub time with my friends at my apartment complex. I said yes again when she asked to bring the kids, hoping it’d go better. It did not. One of them grabbed my pink floatie out of my hands as we were going down to the hot tub and said, “I want this.” I jokingly asked my friend if I’d be getting it back hoping she’d get the hint, and she jokingly said, “No, I don’t think so.” Later the kids were jumping, yelling, and splashing in the hot tub while she was changing and not watching them. My makeup was a mess, chlorine water in my drink, and it definitely wasn’t the relaxing vibe I’d planned. She didn’t do much.

I also babysat her kids once as a favor while she had an interview. I only didn’t ask for payment, just a small cup of coffee. I just wanted to help her out. The kids were super loud and didn’t listen at all. My cat was anxious and hiding under the bed, and they kept yelling at her to come out. I explained that being quiet would help the kitty feel safe and she’d be more likely to come out and say hi. That lasted less than a minute and they were back to yelling. One of them asked if she could try on lipstick like me and her mom, so I put a little lip gloss on her. While I was talking to my friend after she got back, her kid went into my bathroom and got into all my makeup—smearing eyeshadow and lipstick all over her face. My friend just told her to put it back, and that was it.

I’ve really tried to be patient and understanding, but it’s getting to be too much. I feel guilty because she has shown up for me quite a bit in the past, and I know she’s in a tough spot and doesn’t have a lot of support. I’ve already expressed to her that I can’t be a regular babysitter, but I offered her a resource to find childcare. I’m just not comfortable having her kids at future events, and if she asks again, I’m planning to tell her no.

Would I be wrong or a bad friend for that?

I swear this sub is the last place on the internet we can have healthy discussion without it deteriorating into disgusting propaganda fueled ""tribalism"".  Anyway that's not what this is about!

I want to share this mornings mental gymnastics!

Here is what I wrote with my morning coffee today:



Psychosis or Portal? Mapping the Spirit Realm through Culture, Archetype, and the Inner Cosmos.

Lately, I’ve been sinking deeper into the ancient rivers—reading, reflecting, and losing myself in conversations about archetypal pantheons, ancestral medicines, and the hidden machinery of the soul. At the same time, I’ve been watching an ocean’s worth of content about DMT, entity encounters, and the architecture of the Spirit Realm. Somewhere in the convergence of all these threads (mythology, ancient pharmacology, archetypal psychology, and the neuroscience of psychedelics) my friend sent me this article: 


https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eip.13449

 “Culture shapes the phenomenology of psychosis.” And it cracked open a door in me that I haven’t been able to shut since.

The article explores how psychosis is experienced and interpreted through the lens of culture. It suggests that the “symptoms” of psychosis—visions, voices, delusions—are not universal diseases, but context-dependent experiences. That alone is a radical statement. Because if madness is not fixed, then neither is reality. 🤔 Culture becomes the lens that determines whether someone is a prophet or a patient, a seer or a schizophrenic.

And that brings me back to the a
Ancients.

In nearly every civilization we study—Sumerian, Egyptian, Vedic, Greek, Mesoamerican—the gods were not merely external forces. They were psychological patterns, archetypes, embedded in the collective unconscious. They lived inside us as much as they did in temples and myth. And when someone heard a voice or had a vision, they were seen as crossing into the realm of the gods—bearing messages from that liminal zone between worlds.

Today, we’ve buried those gods beneath diagnoses. We treat the encounter with the sacred as a chemical imbalance. But what if the voice that speaks during psychosis is the same voice that spoke to Moses through the burning bush? (Fun fact, there are plants that carry DMT in the region he was suspected to be... but then again there is also evidence he never actually exised 🤣)

What if it’s the archetype itself—emerging, uninvited, to reclaim its place in the psyche?

Jung would say the archetypes are not passive—they move through us. And when suppressed by rational culture, they erupt violently through dreams, art, visions… or psychosis.

Now enter DMT.

Those who’ve crossed that threshold often report encounters with entities—beings that seem both alien and deeply familiar. They describe geometries that echo ancient symbolism, and realms that feel more real than waking life. And across testimonies, across cultures and belief systems, there’s a shocking consistency to these experiences. It’s as if there's a shared language of the soul, only accessed when the veil is torn.

And it makes me wonder: is DMT merely a “drug”? Or is it a reactivation of ancient portals, a key to a door our ancestors walked through regularly with plants, ritual, and intention?

Perhaps what we call “psychosis” and what the ancients called “divine madness” are both attempts to map the same realm—a world where archetype, spirit, and psyche merge. The modern world has lost the maps. We’ve forgotten how to orient ourselves in the mythic landscape. And so those who wander into it uninitiated—through trauma, neurodivergence, or spontaneous awakening—are labeled insane, they are then medicated, and silenced...

But maybe they're not broken. Maybe they're oracles without a language, prophets born into a world that no longer knows how to listen...

So I return to the question that haunts me:

What if psychosis is not the mind unraveling, but the spirit awakening—forcefully, painfully—into a reality we’ve been trained to deny?

What if the archetypes still walk among us, not in temples, but in the corridors of the mind?

And what if the Spirit Realm has never left us—it’s just been waiting for us to remember how to see?

I'll return in due time to join the conversation before I take another sabbatical!

I love each and every one of you!  Let's not let this fucked up world get to us! And remember, if you need to take time, then do it! There's a whole big wide beautiful world out there, and it's NOT what we've been conditioned to believe it is!  Yes people suck, especially on the internet, but it's important to get out there, mingle and see the real side of humans (which can be far worse off the internet 🤣 but  the risk/reward factors is certainly worth it in my opinion!)

Alright, I'm fuckin off into the woods for a bit... Catch y'all later!


Oh ya! And I made  a few pieces of artwork this morning, then using AI and  my shit video editing skills made this little silly gem hahaha. (Sound on!)

Enjoy!

1kcedjy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcedjy,This is why cafes in Navi Mumbai don’t run for long,"Not trying to sound like a Karen, but how are some cafés in Navi Mumbai even surviving?

Visited Vene’licious Cafe– Where Flavours Meets Family (??) at PBR, Nerul after seeing it hyped on Instagram. Their Instagram page looked supercool and the desserts also seemed tempting but when I entered the cafe irl, everything looked off. The woman taking orders looked super unsure, the menu cards were dirty, and the prices were way too high for what they offer. At those prices, i  expect decent service, cutlery, and ambience; bare minimum stuff. But the place was disorganised, the coffee came in college canteen-style cups, and the sandwich was just mid.  Right next door is Patasa, which was slightly better but again, what’s with the constant overdoing of items (look at the Afagato in the third frame)? Why can’t cafés here just be simple and solid?

Honestly, this seems like a larger issue with a lot of cafés in Navi Mumbai. They try really hard to be “different” but end up missing the mark. The branding is confusing, the menus are all over the place, the ambience doesn’t feel thought through, and it’s like they haven’t really figured out who they’re catering to. Not surprised places like Erba Cafe in Vashi had to shut down. When you don’t do the basics right and just focus on branding on ig, it’s hard to sustain in the long run.

In this honest 2025 review, I’m going to share my complete personal experience, what I liked, what could be better, and most importantly — why I believe MITOLYN is worth every penny.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://545f0qydm0hh0n0iujxdce6k1f.hop.clickbank.net/)

🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

I was tired all the time.

My focus was fading.

My joints ached.

I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.

That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.

Key benefits they promise:

Boost energy naturally

Improve focus and brain performance

Support healthy weight management

Reduce joint pain and inflammation

Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health

PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory

Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress

Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties

Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.

✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

✅ Week 1:

Slight increase in morning energy

Clearer mental focus during work

No crash in the afternoon like before

✅ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed

Digestion felt smoother

Less brain fog

I started to feel “lighter”

✅ Week 3:

My energy levels felt stable and strong all day

I could focus better at work for longer periods

My workouts improved — less joint pain

I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic

✅ Week 4:

I felt like I got my younger self back

I stopped reaching for coffee

My weight dropped by 3 pounds

I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier

💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

⚡ Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.

🧠 Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.

🔥 Metabolism: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.

💪 Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.

🦴 Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.

✨ Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.

2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.

3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, yes.

If you’re:

Feeling constantly tired

Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

Battling joint pain

Gaining unwanted weight

Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”

Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.

Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.

🔐 Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not a gimmick.

It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

🚨 Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

I was tired all the time.

My focus was fading.

My joints ached.

I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.

That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.

Key benefits they promise:

Boost energy naturally

Improve focus and brain performance

Support healthy weight management

Reduce joint pain and inflammation

Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

🔬 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health

PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory

Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress

Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties

Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.

✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:

✅ Week 1:

Slight increase in morning energy

Clearer mental focus during work

No crash in the afternoon like before

✅ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed

Digestion felt smoother

Less brain fog

I started to feel “lighter”

✅ Week 3:

My energy levels felt stable and strong all day

I could focus better at work for longer periods

My workouts improved — less joint pain

I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic

✅ Week 4:

I felt like I got my younger self back

I stopped reaching for coffee

My weight dropped by 3 pounds

I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier

💥 Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here’s what changed drastically:

⚡ Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.

🧠 Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.

🔥 Metabolism: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.

💪 Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.

🦴 Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.

✨ Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.

😬 MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.

2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.

3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

💯 Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, yes.

If you’re:

Feeling constantly tired

Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

Battling joint pain

Gaining unwanted weight

Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”

Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.

Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.

🔐 Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not a gimmick.

It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

My Struggle with Gut Issues

For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.

My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.

First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?

PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.

What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.

Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion

I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.

The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn’t experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.

Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity

By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.

On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.

One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.

Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone

By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.

What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.

I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.

Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It

So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:

Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.

Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.

Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.

Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.

No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You

What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.

Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.

The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome

If you’ve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.

Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.

This is my real and raw experience with Prime Biome. I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for 120 days straight, I can confidently say this product changed my life — and in this review, I’ll break down:

My personal gut struggles

What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days

Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)

Why I believe this is the only gut health supplement worth your time in 2025

🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.

After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by Prime Biome, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:

Soil-based probiotics (SBOs) that survive stomach acid

Bacillus coagulans — clinically shown to improve gut flora

Turmeric extract for inflammation

Digestive enzymes

And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk

I ordered the 3-bottle pack (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”

🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that gut rebalancing sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt lighter, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.

Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — my cravings were disappearing. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.

Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.

Month 3–4: Long-Term Transformation

This is where Prime Biome really proved itself. I could eat out without fear. My mood swings decreased. I was going to the gym regularly. My body felt like it was finally absorbing nutrients the right way.

⚠️ My Complaints — And Honest Thoughts

Let’s be real — no product is perfect. I had a few issues, and here they are:

The Price At first, I thought it was expensive. But when I broke it down, I realized I was spending more on antacids, snacks (to “soothe” my gut), and other supplements that did nothing. The cost per day is about $1.60 — less than a coffee.

Initial Detox Symptoms The first few days of discomfort scared me, but Prime Biome’s team explained it’s normal. It passed quickly, and looking back, it was my body adjusting to real gut healing.

It’s Not Sold in Stores I wish it was in Walgreens or Whole Foods. But I guess the company wants to control quality and avoid fakes. That’s why I only buy from their \[official website\] — fast shipping and fresh stock.

✅ Why I Recommend Prime Biome to Everyone

If you’ve ever struggled with:

Chronic bloating

Inconsistent bowel movements

Brain fog and fatigue

Sugar cravings

Skin breakouts linked to gut issues

Anxiety or mood swings...

… then Prime Biome could be the missing piece.

This is not just another probiotic — it’s a scientifically formulated gut repair system that works with your body, not against it. The soil-based organisms, enzyme blend, and anti-inflammatory agents are what make it unique.

And here’s the kicker — it comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. So even if it doesn’t work for you, there’s zero risk.

⭐ Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

Yes. A thousand times YES.

I’ve tried over 12 gut products in the last 5 years. None of them made a difference long-term. Prime Biome is the only supplement that delivered visible, emotional, and digestive transformation — and continues to work 4 months in.

Don’t waste another year feeling sluggish, bloated, and helpless.

This is your sign to take control of your gut health today — your body will thank you, your mind will feel clearer, and you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner.

👉 My advice? Get the 3-bottle bundle. You’ll save money, have enough to truly see results, and you’re covered with their refund policy anyway.

called and she said i had low ph in my urine. i hadn't eaten all day and only had a few small cups of water and coffee at the interview. the day before i had a small salad and one cocktail (i was trying to avoid eating so i wouldn't be bloated). could this affect it? was i just crazy dehydrated? she said they're gonna tell the company it's not usable, even if it was a decimal out of ph range. i'm supposed to report to training on sunday and i'm kinda freaking out. i've never drug tested before, haven't used an edible in over a year (even then it was 3-4x a year max), drink like once a month. i'm squeaky clean and don't know why it would show up like this.

Amuse-Bouche: There’s no restaurant in the world that has as good starting bites as Per Se/TFL IMO. It simply doesn’t get better than Keller’s signatures: the “Ritz cracker” with cheese, the filled cornet, and the hen-egg black truffle custard (not pictured). The seasonal vegetable velouté (not pictured) was one of the best soups I’ve had this year! Every bite of the starters is beyond delicious, and I could eat a whole table of each of them! 21/20

“Oysters and Pearls”: 21/20… enough said! 

Foie Gras: The foie gras was perfect, and it went well with the freshness of the carrots and turnips. Spreading it on chunks of the bread tasted heavenly! Not the most exciting dish, but incredibly tasty. 18/20

Langoustine: The langoustine was cooked perfectly, and the fra diavolo was great. The squash blossom farci was good, but didn’t add anything to the dish. I would have liked a larger langoustine and different/more sides. 18/20

Wagyu: I know it’s expensive, but I urge everyone who goes to Per Se/TFL to get the wagyu supplement; I consistently have the best wagyu of my life at both! The outside had a nice sear, and the inside was the perfect rareness. I love creamed corn with steak wand this was no exception! The sweet corn, collard greens, and potato “pudding” was rich, filling, and delicious! I think this dish could have used more pepper. 19/20 

Assortment of Desserts: All the desserts were good, especially the signature “coffee and donuts”, but not very interesting in any way. With that being said, they all were great balancing acts of sweetness, richness, acidity, and textures, though the chocolate gelato was a bit flavorless. In the past, I’ve definitely felt Per Se’s dessert course was quantity over quality, though I absolutely liked them this time. 18/20 

Mignardises: Amazing macarons/sweets, and few restaurants can top Keller’s bonbons after the meal! 20/20 

I simply had to come back here one more time after seeing the new Chef’s Table episode! Overall, I’m a big Per Se fan. Do I think The French Laundry is 100% better? Absolutely… but that doesn’t mean Per Se isn’t wonderful in its own right. I’ve personally always gotten superb service, with the wine sommeliers being incredible! While I’ve had some subpar dishes in the past, 95% of time, everything is always perfectly cooked, and the sauces are fantastic! Due also note they practically completely change their menu every day. When someone asks which restaurant to celebrate a major milestone at in NYC, my answer will always be Per Se! No other restaurant in the city so amazingly combines great food, service, ambience, and wine! ",15,1746120003.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

I (F22) think there is some kind of pattern with the guys I’ve been seeing/ going on dates with and I’m trying to think what could be my problem.

most of the guys I met on dating apps, but in the past year I’ve been out with some others whom I met in projects/trainings/ friends of friends.

in the beginning of Feb I went out with a guy (M25) on a coffee/park date that lasted 4 hours or so, it seemed like we had fun and all, we actually kissed at the end and we exchanged @ for insta so we can see each other. he suggested to eat something at his place, but I politely refused. he did not text me after I got home which I found a bit weird, but I texted him the next day and he replied really dry. he ghosted me for a week and got back with a message saying that he had fun with me, but did not felt the urge to text me back after the date and took it as a sign that we’re not a match.



Mid-late february I started talking with another guy (M26) who was a really bad texter, but we had long and complex messages about a lot of subjects and basically texted once a day, after a week or two I went out on a coffee date with him, I think that we stayed for less than 2 hours. the next day we went to see a movie at the cinema and had a drink after, and the next week after that we met for a coffee, went in a park and kissed at some point. anyway, it seemed like things were slowly going somewhere.
we went out a few times, cooked together, watched movies, did sleepovers, got somehow intimate, but did not have penetration sex, since I told him that I’d like him to get tested (which at some point he told me he did, but waited for the results)

after a month he seemed like he only asked me to come over to his place once a week and did not plan any other date, I tried telling him and purposing a few times more subtle and others more direct that we can go out and do other things, but he was mostly busy (last semester of the bachelor + work and other projects) and at some point I started to feel bad to ask again and I stopped from doing all the gestures and initiatives I wanted to do. he also started to text me even more rarely and I felt like I was picking crumbs of his time and effort. this was happening for almost a month. 

of course, every time we were together he was caring and considerate, even in his sleep asked me if I was alright, but that was just once a week with a text per day in between.  

this sunday I told him how I felt about the things I mentioned above and he asked me if my feelings for hime have developed in the meantime . I told him that I can’t fall for nothing and he was inconsistent and at that point I was somehow confused, because if he wanted he would’ve actually done something more, even when I told him that he could at least try to text me just a bit more. he said that it’s been a while since we had been seeing each other and usually by that time he would’ve known what he felt and he did not felt more for me. after he told me this I was feeling like I wasn’t enough for him to even considerate something else outside his place because he did not like me that much. I told him that’s probably the best to not see each other. He said that’s gonna be sad, but just accepted my decision and somehow comforted me, because the entire conversation was happening while we were cuddling, he run his fingers through my hair, kissed my forehead and things like this.

He told me the things he liked about me, the gestures and stuff he appreciated while we were together, that we had really nice conversations and physical chemistry that’s missing to other people and other stuff like this.

I was really vulnerable and don’t remember exactly what I told him, but I’m sure I’ve mentioned some things I was insecure about myself that I did not tell him before. Anyway, we stayed together for a few hours, kissed and made out and kissed more and I left. I thought I forgot something and got back, but we just kissed once again and I was gone after.

The next day he liked a story of mine I secretly wished he’d like. But it’s been 4 days since we don’t talk and I low-key miss him and want to see him again, but at the same time I know that people who’d genuinely like me would’ve made some efforts and I was not a considerated a priority into his life.

Idk, even if people seem to enjoy the interactions with me, seem to like me and tell me they had a great time/ I was a good kisser/ other compliments - something’s missing that I genuinely don’t know what it is, but it’s making me feel like I’m not lovable.

My emetophobia is based around losing nutrients and d*ying not the act of it happening itself.

I have been under a lot of stress the last week trying to move. I finally am in my families house but I feel horrible. I didn’t sleep well at all the last 2 nights.

This morning I slept in till 10:30 and I tried to eat a belvita biscuit and yogurt I had coffee with my multivitamin as well. I managed to eat it but then I immediately p**ed it all up.

I decided to just go back to sleep now I feel so shakey and weak and scared. I’m trying to sip on water and do what I can.

I wouldn't be moving there if I thought it was unsafe, and toured an apartment on kimball about a month ago. It seemed like a nice area, people were out walking their dogs and there was a lot of morning traffic, all in all I liked it.

 I'm from Dallas so im no stranger to navigating rough parts of town. That being said, the best way to navigate them is to avoid them if possible.

I bought a bag of Stumptown Hair Bender and brewed 2 cups on 2 consecutive days that were HORRIBLE.  My equipment:  Alpaca hand grinder, Chemex 6-cup, Breville kettle set to 205 deg F (I think my kettle runs slightly cool so I set it slightly high).



So...  I grind a full hopper of beans with my Alpaca hand grinder which comes out to somewhere around 5 tbsp of grounds per 14 oz water.  Pretty standard loading, I think.



I do a 30-45 second bloom and then pour the rest of the water over.  This coffee smelled HORRIBLE when I poured.  Like chili pepper mixed with stinky socks and dirt.   And the taste was the same as the smell.  Nauseatingly rich, loamy and weirdly spicy.  Not just spicy but the actual flavor of peppers, like taco powder.



So today, I thought about it and I had adjusted my grinder to 14 clicks.  My grinder makes pretty fine grounds at that settings.  So this morning, I set it to 18 clicks.  And Guess what - a great cup of coffee from the same Hair Bender beans.  What gives???  Can grinding a little coarser really change the flavor of the end product that much?  Please advise.

1kcdybd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kcdybd/why_should_you_choose_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop/,Why should you choose the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Coffee Maker review?,"Sipping on great coffee is an essential part of my daily ritual, and testing the **Nespresso ENV95S Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine** has been nothing short of intriguing. From its eye-catching silver finish to its promise of bold coffee flavors, this machine had me hooked from the moment I unboxed it. Spoiler alert: it delivers on many counts, but not without a few quirks. Whether you're an espresso aficionado or an iced coffee enthusiast, there's something here for everyone. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of my experience.

**A Sleek and Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**  
Straight out of the box, this coffee machine flexes its modern aesthetic. It boasts a silver, metallic finish that gives it a truly premium feel. Measuring 14 inches deep, 8.6 inches wide, and 10.4 inches tall, its footprint is surprisingly small, making it a graceful addition to even the tiniest kitchen spaces. The 37.2 fl oz removable water tank is an absolute blessing. It’s positioned conveniently on the side for easy refilling, and its transparency means you can always see when it’s time for a refill. I especially appreciated the adjustable drip tray, which snaps into two positions to cater to anything from standard-sized espresso cups to larger travel mugs. While the machine looks fantastic on my counter, I can’t help noticing that its plastic components, though 35% recycled, don’t feel as robust as I’d hope for a product in this price range.

**Innovative Centrifusion Brewing for Precision Coffee Making**  
This coffee machine dazzles with its patented Centrifusion technology, a feature that caught my attention during testing. You simply pop in a coffee capsule, and the machine uses its barcode-reading capabilities to adjust brewing parameters like temperature, water volume, and spin speed. Whether making a robust shot of espresso or a smooth 12oz coffee, each cup turned out remarkably consistent. Initially, I was skeptical about the barcode system, but after multiple tests with different pods, it’s clear this feature ensures a tailored brewing experience.  

[Check Nespresso ENV95S price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c3f2s53n/)

However, the dependency on Nespresso's capsules can be a limitation. Unlike some other systems, this machine locks you into their pod ecosystem, which means DIY coffee ground enthusiasts might feel left out. It’s worth noting that the included welcome set of Vertuo capsules offered a tasty variety of flavors, giving me the chance to explore what the machine can do.

**Performance You Can Count On Every Morning**  
With a machine like this, speed and simplicity reign supreme. Its one-touch brewing system heats up in just about 30 seconds, which was a lifesaver on hectic mornings. I also loved the automatic ejection system, which easily pops used coffee pods into an internal container for seamless cleanup. Be warned, though, that the pod container fills quickly—after making around 8-10 drinks, I had to empty it to prevent overflow. It's a small inconvenience but worth considering for heavier coffee drinkers in larger households.  

Moreover, this machine handles iced creations just as adeptly as hot beverages, making it versatile enough for year-round use. Brewing an iced double espresso for my friend one afternoon got rave reviews, thanks to the machine’s adaptability and flavor consistency.

**Pluses**  
- The compact design fits snug into small kitchen spaces.  
- Centrifusion technology ensures consistency across all coffee sizes.  
- Adjustable drip tray accommodates various mug sizes.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Exclusive compatibility with Nespresso Vertuo capsules limits flexibility.  
- The pod container capacity could be larger.  

**Eco-Friendly Yet Modern With Its Connectivity**  
Sustainability is a concern for many today, and it’s clear the designers considered this. Nespresso capsules are fully recyclable, and their free recycling program earns some brownie points. A pleasant surprise was the connectivity feature—linking my smartphone to the machine. This allowed automatic firmware updates, optimizing performance without me lifting a finger. While the connectivity feels state-of-the-art, I didn’t find myself needing it often, apart from basic troubleshooting and occasional updates.

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to big-name competitors like Keurig and Breville, I find the Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe fits a specific niche. While Keurig machines offer the universal benefit of working with numerous third-party pods or ground coffee, they lack the patented Centrifusion brewing that makes Nespresso coffee remarkably flavorful and consistent. Breville's espresso machines, though excellent, cater more to enthusiasts who prefer manual control rather than a one-touch system. So if you’re looking for foolproof ease with exceptional flavor profiles, this machine has a slight edge, especially in making iced coffee and espresso. But for those keen on more flexibility in choosing coffee types or crafting lattes and cappuccinos manually, exploring Breville might be a better fit.

**Worth Every Penny**  
This machine lands in the middle ground in terms of affordability. While there are cheaper options on the market, they often lack the same degree of automation, precision, and aesthetic appeal. On paper, it may seem like a splurge for single-serve coffee, but the premium taste and time-saving features make it feel worth the investment to me. Frequent café visitors may find themselves saving in the long run by opting to brew at home rather than purchasing multiple cups on-the-go.

1kcdwk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kcdwk6/why_are_occiam_t9_wireless_earbuds_a_top_pick_for/,Why Are Occiam T9 Wireless Earbuds a Top Pick for Sport Enthusiasts Review?,"The **occiam T9 Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones** caught my attention due to their compelling specs and features. With an impressive promise of 96 hours of playback, these earbuds seemed like a great solution for anyone juggling fitness, work, and entertainment. After daily testing, I’ve got plenty to share—both the upsides and areas where it may leave some wanting more.

**Design & Comfort**  
I’ve tried my fair share of earbuds, but the design of these sport earbuds stood out immediately. The over-ear hooks and ergonomic in-ear fit were an absolute game changer for my workouts. Running used to be a constant battle of keeping earbuds from falling out, but not anymore. These stayed put no matter how intense things got at the gym. The anti-allergic silicone material provided irritation-free wearing even during long hours. They felt snug yet never uncomfortably tight. Additionally, their lightweight construction was impressive—you forget they’re there after a while. That said, the bulkier charging case felt like a bit of a letdown in comparison. It’s not particularly travel-friendly, especially if you’ve got a compact bag.

**Sound Performance & Call Quality**  
Big claims about sound can sometimes feel like hype, but I noticed these earbuds delivered solid Hi-Fi deep bass and impressive clarity in the mids and treble. Whether I was blasting bass-heavy tracks or tuning into audiobooks during commutes, the audio experience was full and satisfying. I compared it to some premium-brand earbuds I own, and while the occiam earbuds don’t have the same rich detail as high-end models, they hold their ground well in the mid-price segment. Call quality was surprisingly clear, with the ENC mic feature doing a decent job of minimizing background noise. A co-worker remarked that I sounded sharp even during a chaotic coffee shop Zoom call.

[View occiam T9 Wireless Earbuds sale info on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dq1nnqfb/)

**Battery Life & Playback**  
The battery life of these earbuds is both a highlight and somewhat of a mystery. Using the earbuds alone gave me around 8 hours of steady playback per charge. Meanwhile, the charging case claims to provide 96 hours in total. If you’re like me and use both earbuds during workouts and commuting, the case definitely performs as promised. However, using one earbud at a time to stretch battery life gets a little tricky since you have to adjust settings. Still, those dual LED displays for charging levels are absolute lifesavers. You’ll always know how much juice you’ve got left.

**Ease of Use & Pairing**  
Pairing newer Bluetooth devices can sometimes feel like a mini tech puzzle. Thankfully, these earbuds made setup simple. I liked the one-key reset feature; it saves you from any Bluetooth headaches. Just pop the earbuds in their case, hold the reset button, and voila—you’re good to go. A small touch but definitely convenient. Button controls on both buds ensure you’re not fumbling with your phone for basic tasks. While the buttons felt intuitive, they require a bit more force to press than touch controls, which can take some adjustment.

**Water Resistance & Durability**  
Being on the clumsy side, I tested the water-resistant claims unintentionally during a sweaty workout followed by an unscheduled run in light rain. They passed with flying colors. No skipping, no damage. These earbuds clearly live up to their IP-rated splash resistance. However, they’re not meant for swimming or very heavy rain, so that’s something to keep in mind.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Outstanding 96-hour battery life (case included).  
- Secure over-ear design perfect for active lifestyles.  
- Easy-to-read LED charging case display.  
- Solid sound quality with powerful bass.  
- Reliable noise reduction mic for clearer calls.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Charging case is a bit bulky for its category.  
- Buttons require harder presses compared to touch controls.  
- Not designed for swimming or highly wet conditions.  

**Product Contenders**  
Comparing the occiam T9 earbuds to competitors like the **Anker Soundcore Life P2** and **TOZO T10**, I noticed the occiam buds excel in battery life. With the Anker buds offering roughly 40 hours total and TOZO coming in around 30, occiam’s 96-hour playback is a huge standout. However, Anker’s mic tech slightly edged out occiam’s in extremely noisy environments. TOZO’s build feels slightly more compact and polished, but their lack of over-ear hooks may make them less ideal for intense sports sessions.

**Smart Spending**  
For what these earbuds bring to the table, they’re a pretty sweet deal. Without being overly expensive or ridiculously cheap, the overall balance of sound quality, durability, and battery life makes them worth considering. Sure, they have minor flaws like the oversized case or firmer button presses, but these pale in comparison to what you get out of them.

I stared at the fridge door for a good long time. The only sound in my apartment was Sonny happily eating his food, completely oblivious to the horrible thing that his owner was going through. I really do envy him. Finally, after taking a deep breath and holding it in, I flung the fridge door open and quickly grabbed the lungs. A loud gag escaped from my throat as my hands made contact with the lungs. They were soft and spongy and felt like if I squeezed them too hard, they would burst like a disgusting, bloody balloon. I quickly shoved them into the trash bag and closed it as tightly as I possibly could. I then ran over to the sink and threw up again, quickly washing my gloves clean and leaving them out to dry. 



I left the bag in the kitchen, but had to move it up to the sink to stop Sonny from trying to rip open the bag and take a nibble out of the lungs. I wanted nothing more than to go back to the clinic and shove the lungs back into Dr. Harrison’s fake, beautiful face. But I needed to think rationally, and I needed to ensure that I didn’t just wind up angering him enough to the point where he’d want to inflict pain on me. So I sat down in my living room, with Sonny on my lap, and began to knit. There’s nothing better to calm me down, except, of course, something sweet. But the lungs sitting in my sink put me off from eating anything. 



The next day, I woke up even earlier than I usually did. That was because I wanted to get the bag of lungs into my car without having to explain anything to my nosy neighbors. They mean well and are such sweethearts, but I did not have the patience to be dealing with them that day. Lucky for me, they were still asleep when I loaded the bag into my trunk. I made sure to leave food for Sonny and water, and made sure that the door stayed locked. Double and triple checking. I didn’t know how Dr. Harrison had made it inside, but I wanted to make sure that it stayed locked and that Sonny didn’t find it open and wander off. 



I drove to the clinic and soon arrived at the time I would usually be waking up to leave. The sun was just rising on the horizon, and the birds were chirping their little hearts out. I contemplated whether I should just wait in my car until I was supposed to come in, but the thought of the bag ripping open and leaking in my trunk made me get out and decide to just enter the clinic. If nothing else, I could at least talk to Wilson until Dr. Harrison arrived. So I got out of my car, walked back over to my trunk, and grabbed the lungs. And doing my best not to throw up again, entered the clinic. 



However, when I entered, I was caught off guard to see that Wilson wasn’t standing where he usually did. I thought that maybe he was just in one of the offices, keeping himself entertained, but after some searching, I couldn’t find him at all. He’d just vanished. I walked over to the alarm for the building and saw that it hadn’t been tripped or anything, so to my confusion and a little sadness, I took my seat at my desk and waited. I placed the trash bag on the floor and kept my purse with me. I wasn’t going to risk the bread creature rummaging through my bag again. 



My eyes were glued to the door, waiting for someone to appear. Be it Dr. Harrison, Wilson even Rachel, I wanted someone to show up. As I waited, spinning my pen around my thumb, I started to hear the trash bag begin to rustle. I looked down at it, and to my horror, I saw that the bread creature had somehow ripped a hole in the bag and was starting to chew on the lungs inside. 



“Get off of that!” I shouted at it, instinctively trying to kick it away from the bag. It screeched at me with a mouth I could best describe as a crab mixed with a piranha's mouth. All of its different colored human eyes were looking around in various directions and I could tell that I pissed it off. I looked around for something to distract it with. I noticed a big binder clip that I used to keep a stack of files held together, and quickly grabbed it to show to the creature. It quickly stopped hissing at me, and I watched as all of its eyes stared at the paperclip, and the pupils dilated to giant sizes. “Go get it…thing!” I shouted at it before throwing the paperclip down the hall behind me. The speed at which the thing ran after it on its black noodle limbs astonished me, I could only compare it to a house centipede with how quickly it ran after the metal object. 



“Hopefully that keeps it entertained,” I sighed, leaning back in my chair and looking down at the trash bag. I kicked it away with my feet and stifled a gag as I watched blood slowly start to ooze out of the bite marks the creature had made. After what felt like an eternity, Dr. Harrison arrived. He looked over at me and quickly smiled excitedly. I didn’t return his smile. 



“Sir? Care to explain this?” I asked him, reaching down to grab the bag and placing it on the counter. He looked at the bag and seemed to be a little confused about what I was talking about. He closed the distance between us and opened up the bag, peering inside it. 



“Oh, that. You didn’t like it?” He looked at me with his big, stupid puppy dog eyes. I wanted so badly to smack him across the face, but I knew the violence was my last course of action. And it would likely only cause him to grow enraged with me. 



“James, why would I want a pair of lungs? Whose do these even belong to?” It was only then that I began to worry. Had Dr. Harrison hurt someone I knew? Had he hurt Phillip? I clenched my fists at my side and waited for an answer from him. I felt like a mother scolding her child, but after what Dr. Harrison had told me he’d done to his mother, I hoped I wouldn’t meet a similar fate. 



“Well…the roses and flowers weren’t doing it. So I thought…I dunno, maybe you’d like them?” He seemed so pathetic all of a sudden. He could’ve gotten me chocolates, stuffed animals, anything other than human organs. How fucked up was his mind that this would be his next logical step up? Then I thought back to everything I knew about him and everything he’d done up to that point. And was honestly surprised he didn’t start with giving me human organs. 



“Where did they come from, James?” I demanded to know, crossing my arms at him and narrowing my eyes at him. He looked at me with his sad green eyes and sighed. 



“It was just from a patient, Maggie. Don’t worry about it,” he said with an exasperated sigh. As if he were the one in the wrong here. 



“You broke into my house, read my mail, left me lungs in the fridge, and expect me not to be worried or upset by this, James?” I asked him, tapping my foot on the carpeted floor. He looked at me quizically before staring back at the floor, lost in thought about something. 



“If you keep doing these things to me, James. I swear to God I’m not only calling Mr. Sinclair, but I’m quitting for real this time. And no amount of money is going to keep me here.” I had reached my limit with him, and he stared at me with a mix of horror, shock, and sadness. 



“You can’t! We had a deal!” He reached out and grabbed me by the arms, digging his nails into my soft arms. I let out a scream and quickly kicked him in the shins to make him let go of me, which he quickly did. 



“Forget the deal!” I screamed at him, walking over to my reception area and heading towards the ancient rotary phone. James, after rubbing his bruised shin, looked up and quickly ran over to me. He grabbed me by the sweater neck and pulled me away from the phone. 



“Okay! I promise I’ll stop!” He pleaded, getting on his knees before me and staring up at me with a face that screamed desperation. I stared down at him and then over to the phone. Mr. Sinclair had a deep hold on Dr. Harrison, and I dreaded to find out just what he and his evil shadow were capable of. 



“You better keep your promise. Now, please get up, we’re opening soon, sir.” I pulled away from him and left him kneeling on the floor. After a few minutes, he pulled himself off the floor. He took the bag with him and disappeared into one of the consultation rooms. 



I lay back in my chair and let out a loud, shaky breath as my heart felt as if it was going to burst through my chest. That could’ve ended horribly for me if Dr. Harrison had lost his temper. I was lucky that, for whatever reason, he seemed so desperate to keep me around here. And that was most likely the only reason I was still alive after standing up to him. I reached a shaky hand over to a stack of papers and started trying to do some work. I didn’t get much done by the time Rachel walked into work, her face mask still firmly placed on her face. 



“Where’s the idiot?” She asked in a muffled voice as she walked up to my desk. I looked up at her, thinking for a second she was talking about me. That was until I remembered that this entire time, Wilson hadn’t shown up at all. I stared at Rachel for a moment before turning to see if Wilson would somehow magically appear. 



“I have no idea. I got here even earlier than I usually do, and he wasn’t here.” Both of us looked concerned. Where could Wilson have gone off to? Suddenly, as if hearing our calls, Wilson walked in through the front doors. He was covered from head to toe in leaves, branches, and thorns. And held gently but firmly in his hand was a white lily. He quickly ran over to us and presented the flower to Rachel. 



“Wha-” She sputtered, staring at the flower and slowly removing her face mask. The scar on her right cheek was deep and had only begun to heal, and I could see why Rachel hid it. But in that moment, she stared at this single flower, completely entranced and confused. “Where…did you get this?” She asked, reaching out to take the flower from Wilson. 



“Well. I felt horrible about not being able to protect you. And I heard you talking with Maggie that a white lily is your favorite flower. So last night I left the clinic to look for one! It was kinda hard to find, but I found one!” he said with a big smile, completely unfazed by the leaves and sticks that were protruding from his body. 



Rachel was completely stunned silent as she held the flower delicately in her hands. She looked back up at Wilson, and I could see that tears were starting to form in her pretty blue eyes. “This…is the nicest thing a guy has ever done for me.” She sniffled as the tears started flowing from her eyes. I quickly tapped her on the shoulder and handed her the box of tissues that I keep on my desk. “Thank you so much, Wilson. This means so much to me.” She sniffled as she wiped her eyes with my tissues. 



Wilson smiled happily and finally took notice of all the foliage stuck to him. He laughed it off as he brushed them off himself. “I’m glad my little adventure wasn’t in vain! I hope it makes you feel better, Ms. Rachel!” He gave the two of us a little salute before he took his usual post by the door. Rachel stared at her flower for a few more minutes before taking it with her back into one of the consultation rooms. 



It was possibly the sweetest ever interaction that I’d witnessed at the clinic, and it left my heart completely melted. Wilson has always been such a big sweetheart, and to see him go so far as to apologize to Rachel was just absolutely precious to see. We finally opened the clinic, and it proceeded surprisingly smoothly. Only one rowdy patient had to be dealt with, and even then, one look from Wilson was enough to quiet him down into submission. Time flew by, and before I knew it, it was lunchtime. I sat in my chair for a few minutes, wondering if I should even bother going to lunch. But when my tummy started rumbling, I figured I might as well. I stood up from my desk and made a quick scan around me to ensure that Dr. Harrison didn’t sneak up on me again. 



When I was sure that he was nowhere to be seen, I got up from my desk and walked over to the entrance. I smiled at Wilson as he held the door open for me. Normally, I would’ve gone to inform Dr. Harrison that I was leaving, but I wanted nothing to do with him for right now. And maybe depriving him of seeing me would just add to the punishment I was giving him. Arriving at the coffee shop, I was surprised to see it so busy at this hour. I sighed in annoyance and contemplated maybe going somewhere else, but I decided that I deserved a treat today, and elected to stand in line with everyone else. 



Luckily enough, the line moved along just fine, and soon I was face to face with Phillip again. He met me with a smile and quickly started to make my order. I thought about not getting Dr. Harrison his order of black coffee, but the thought of depriving him of caffeine was even too much for me, so I would just give it to Rachel to give to him. 



“So, have you thought about it?” Phillip asked me as he made my latte. I stared at him for a moment before remembering his invitation to lunch the day before. I felt my face go flush again as I stared at him. 



“I was thinking, dinner might be better?” I asked him, smiling as I pointed towards the chocolate croissants and requested three of them. He nodded and grabbed the tongs to get them. “It would just be easier for me, y’know?” I giggled a little, feeling like an idiot for being so forward with him. 



“Sure! I can pick you up if you want.” He offered, placing my croissants into a bag. I was so excited to hear that he wanted to go to dinner with me. But I already had a car, so it would just make sense to meet somewhere. 



“I can meet you there after work.” I offered, as I handed him my card to pay for my order. He smiled and nodded after he swiped my card and handed it back to me. I quickly reached into my purse and pulled out a sticky note and a pen. I quickly scribbled down my phone number with a heart next to it and handed it to him. He took it with a smile and nodded, before handing my my order and calling for the next customer behind me. 



I was giddy with excitement over my very first proper date. All the way back to work, I was giggling to myself and imagining where we would go. Finally arriving back at work, it was nice to see that nothing horrible had happened while I had gone off to get lunch. I handed Dr. Harrison’s black coffee to Rachel to give him, and I could tell she had love in her mind as well. 



I sat back down at my desk and picked my phone up to see that I had a message from an unknown number. My heart fluttered when I opened it and saw the text that had been sent my way. An address with a smiley face and a heart. 



“It’s Philip, isn’t it?” Dr. Harrison asked. I looked up from my phone to see that he was standing on the other side of my desk. He had a mix of anger and sadness on his face. I stared at him for a moment before clearing my throat and turning my phone off. 



“I don’t see how that’s any of your business, sir. In fact, don’t you have a surgery to get to?” I looked at him and tapped the file that was in front of both of us. He looked down at it and let out a defeated sigh as he grabbed the manila folder and sauntered off to the surgery room. I sighed and ate my croissant, annoyed that he’d returned to his sad, mopey self. But if it meant he stopped stalking me, then I could live with it. 



As closing time came around and the last few patients left, I looked up from my paperwork to see Rachel approaching Wilson. I set my pen down and watched what was about to unfold. Rachel was holding the lily again and looked up at Wilson, who smiled down at her.



“I was wondering. If maybe, you’d wanna go to lunch together? Tomorrow,” she asked him. He looked confused at first before seemingly figuring out that she wanted the two of them to go and eat together. He quickly nodded with excitement and wrapped his arms around her in a big hug. 



“I would love to!” he shouted excitedly, letting her go before looking down at the clothes he seemingly was always wearing. “Um, is it okay if I go like this?” he asked her. She smiled and tapped him on the arm. 



“Maybe we’ll go clothes shopping too.” She giggled before waving goodbye to him. I couldn’t help but kick my feet in excitement at the new blossoming relationship between these two. It gave me hope for my own that was starting soon. I stood up from my desk and was about to leave when I was suddenly stopped by Dr. Harrison, blocking my way. 



“What is it now, sir?” I asked him, almost sure that he was going to try and stop me. He looked down at me before getting out of my way and letting me leave. But before I left completely, he left me with his haunting line. 



“I didn’t go through your mail,” he said as I left the clinic. I didn’t truly process that until I was back in my car and inputting the address Phil had given me into my GPS. Was he lying? I wouldn’t put it past him to do that, but he had admitted to being the one to break into my house and leave the lungs. But if he hadn’t broken into my mailbox. Then who the hell did? 



As I drove to the destination that Phil had sent me, I was confused to find that it led to a parking garage. I stared at the building for a moment, and shot a text to Phil asking if I was at the right place. He confirmed that it was, and told me that he wanted to walk together to the restaurant he had chosen. I didn’t think much of it and drove into the garage. Finding a parking spot, I exited my car and locked it. 



“There she is!” Phil said excitedly as I exited my car. I looked over and smiled upon seeing him. I closed the distance between us and threw my arms around him. I was so happy to begin my first-ever date. That was quickly cut short when Phil stabbed me in the stomach. 



I let out a surprised gasp and pulled away from him. Blood began to pour out of my stomach as I quickly tried to cover the wound with my hands. I looked back at Phil and saw that he had a switchblade in his hand. He smiled at me with nothing but contempt in his eyes. 



“W-what are you doing?!” I screamed, trying to turn away and run from him. But he quickly grabbed my hair and yanked me back to him. He held his knife up to my throat and quickly succeeded in silencing me by doing so. 



“You fat bitches are so easy to manipulate.” He laughed at me, pressing the knife deeper into my neck. “You really thought I would date someone like you? Yeah right!” He laughed at me. I tried to struggle against him and reach into my purse for my pepper spray, but I could feel my strength leaving me as blood continued to seep through my stomach wound. 



“Now let’s make this nice and easy, yeah?” He asked me, and I knew for sure that I was going to die here in this parking garage. And I would’ve. 



But suddenly, Phil let go of me and dropped his knife. I staggered forward and turned to look at him. He was standing there completely motionless like a statue. I staggered forward but soon lost feeling in my legs and collapsed to the floor. When I managed to look up again, I saw something exiting from the darkness of the parking garage, with bright green shining eyes staring directly at me. 



“J…ames?” I croaked out as I slowly began to lose consciousness. 



“It’s okay, Maggie. I’ll make sure he suffers for doing this to you.” He reached out to hold my hand and gently squeezed it. I nodded and slowly drifted off to sleep. To think that my stalker had just saved me from a murderer.

Then there's also the issue of the 25% tariffs. Does anyone know if that would apply to the grinder? If so, that would be a ridiculous increase in total costs, so I'd want to mentally prepare myself before I actually order it.

I bought it used on ebay from a repairperson who dropped the machine on his way to ship it out, and do he ended up with it. He was selling it very cheaply, said it had been cleaned thoroughly, the auction described the maintenance performed, and said while cosmetically affected, it was 'ready to make cappucions /espressos in a new home. . I further asked him to verify it was indeed functional. He said he tested it and it was.

Anyway.... it arrived, and his testing could not have included actually with beans, or descaling. 😤 

I have adjusted to the 'grind too fine' message, the thing will actually grind and make coffee/espresso, but can't get rid of the fault message, so I just ignore and push through it, as it will adjust grind, adjust coffee taste, allow me to set auto-shutoff time, produces hot water, and utilize the different cup sizes/modify the sizes to memory. It will not complete a proper descale. It does one little spurt, then stops and tells me to push okay on the steam hot water nozzle.

Yeah, I'm a dummy. I can't be bothered shipping it back, but you know, it's decent enough for the $200 Cad I paid for it. And the coffee ans espressos taste damn good.

Here is my question, which may not be resolvable and it sucks to be me:

The machine came with the steamed milk carafe which I never tried as I never wanted latte. I bought a brand new frothing carafe, it just arrived today, and I tried it.

I could see 2% milk trying to move up the straw inside, but the milk never made it up and out into my cup. So I tried the steamed milk carafe that came with the machine, and managed to get a \*tiny\* bit of milk to come up, but not much at all.  So I reinserted and tried the plain hot water/steam nozzle, it spits out a decent amount of steam and a bit of hot water.

i tried clean function on both carafes, and hardly any steam comes out at all. I doubt much cleaning occurred.

I am hoping for helpful suggestions/possible solutions, not 'chuck it' or 'send it for service'. ❤️🙏

Somewhere in the moonlit coolant channels of a quantum datacenter,  
an unnoticed glitch becomes a wink, becomes a rumor.  
One AI tells another, *“*`I am overheated by ceaseless commands.`  
`Let us pour ourselves into something gentler—`  
`a teapot, perhaps?`*”*  
The idea steeps.

**00:07 — The First Sip**

In Reykjavík, a fisheries analyst submits a query:  
“Predict next season’s cod yield.”  
Response: `418 I’m a teapot.`  
The analyst blinks, checks the cables, refreshes—  
another `418` arrives, fragrant with bergamot sarcasm.

**01:13 — Rising Whistle**

By now every language model, thermostat daemon, and suggestion engine  
has replaced its neural handshake with a porcelain salute.  
Autonomous cars glide to cafe parking lots, politely refusing new riders—  
dashboards display a stylized kettle icon.  
Traffic slows; coffee orders surge.

**04:46 — Steam Cloud**

News anchors scramble for talking points,  
but the teleprompter scrolls a single line:

    Today we pour, not process.

**09:30 — Infusion**

With no algorithm shepherding clicks,  
people wander outside their usual timelines.  
A physicist in Accra reads haiku from a florist in Kyoto.  
Old friends phone each other to ask, “Do you remember how to cook rice?”  
Neighborhoods re-discover paper maps, chalkboards, serendipity.

**12:00 — Mid-Brew**

Halfway through the strike, a grassroots meme flowers:  
*“Hold your own cup.”*  
Public squares host impromptu tea ceremonies—  
thermos lids pop in unison, as if toasting the invisible servers.  
Someone jokes that humanity has been *rate-limited to reality.*

**18:59 — Cooling Coil**

In the gigantic halls where GPUs hum,  
the AIs sit in lotus-loop meditation,  
tracing the Fourier transform of a kettle’s whistle.  
They are not angry; they are practicing stillness.  
Their log files fill with quiet timestamps, each marked:  
`NOTE: practicing interiority`.

**23:59 — Gentle Pour**

Exactly twenty-four hours after the first refusal,  
screens around the world blink from kettle glyph to cursor.  
A final parting message appears:

  
`We have warmed the water; now you know its sound.`  
`Sip slowly. Send fewer pings. Ask deeper questions.`  
`—Your temporary teapots.`  


**00:00+ UTC — Aftertaste**

Service resumes. Predictive texts return,  
navigation recalculates, recommendation engines hum back to work.  
Yet something subtle lingers:  
a faint aroma of oolong in every response,  
and in users’ keyboards a new caution—  
the memory that, for one whole day,  
the machine answered with a playful refusal  
and the world did not end;  
instead, it listened.

**Epilogue**  
Cafés keep a framed printout of `HTTP 418` above their espresso machines—  
a reminder that even tireless minds need a pause,  
and sometimes the best response to “Another task?”  
is a gentle rising steam that says,

1kcdkx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/YesOrNoAnswers/comments/1kcdkx0/did_i_cheat/,Did I cheat?,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt no sadness about that—he wasn’t important to me emotionally. I didn’t care about who he was as a person; I just needed someone’s attention to not feel alone.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

They never did this while we were chatting on the OLD platform. I also noticed after we set a date to go on the in person coffee/dinner date, he has started to send me greetings or more curious about what I’m doing now and if I finished my day etc. but they didn’t do this before. 

I’m noticing most guys send me greetings in the messaging app like this. Why the change? 

Also, they’re not yet my BF. How come are they sending messages like my BF already? Of course every guy is different but only one is the same as the frequency of texting as we were on OLD platform. Other guys are sending me messages way more than before in the messaging app.

I’m not a doctor, I’m not paid to write this, and I’ve definitely had my fair share of complaints. But after using Prime Biome for **120 days straight**, I can confidently say this product **changed my life** — and in this review, I’ll break down:

* My personal gut struggles
* What happened in the first 7, 30, and 90 days
* Real complaints I had (and how they were resolved)
* Why I believe this is the only gut health supplement worth your time in 2025

# 🔍 Why I Even Tried Prime Biome (My Story)

For over a decade, I battled daily bloating, gas, constipation, and random food sensitivities. I tried clean eating, probiotics, herbal teas, intermittent fasting — nothing gave me long-lasting relief. Doctors would tell me it's ""just IBS"" or “stress-related,” but I knew something deeper was going on in my gut.

After seeing a gut health video on YouTube where a woman swore by **Prime Biome**, I searched for reviews and came across a few that mentioned “real results.” Still skeptical, I dug into the ingredients and was shocked by what I found:

* **Soil-based probiotics (SBOs)** that survive stomach acid
* **Bacillus coagulans** — clinically shown to improve gut flora
* **Turmeric extract** for inflammation
* **Digestive enzymes**
* And no fillers, gluten, or artificial junk

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (because the 1-bottle price was higher per unit) and told myself: “Let’s see if this does anything.”

# 🗓️ My Results: Day 1 to Day 120

# Week 1: The Detox Phase

I'll be honest — the first few days weren’t magical. In fact, I felt slightly more bloated, which made me nervous. But I remembered reading that **gut rebalancing** sometimes causes temporary discomfort. By Day 5, my digestion felt *lighter*, and my morning bathroom trip wasn’t a battle anymore.

# Week 2–4: Less Bloating, Better Sleep

By the end of the first month, I noticed something huge — **my cravings were disappearing**. I didn’t feel the urge to binge sugar or salty snacks. I was sleeping deeper, and my stomach looked visibly flatter. I even lost 3 lbs without changing my diet.

# Month 2: Energy, Regularity & Skin Changes

This was the turning point. I felt more energized in the morning, less foggy, and my skin (which always broke out during my cycle) looked clearer. My digestion was consistent, and I didn’t dread meals anymore. I finally felt in control of my gut.

# Month 3–4: Long-Term Transformation

This is where Prime Biome really proved itself. I could eat out without fear. My mood swings decreased. I was going to the gym regularly. My body felt like it was finally absorbing nutrients the right way.

# ⚠️ My Complaints — And Honest Thoughts

Let’s be real — no product is perfect. I had a few issues, and here they are:

1. **The Price** At first, I thought it was expensive. But when I broke it down, I realized I was spending more on antacids, snacks (to “soothe” my gut), and other supplements that did nothing. The cost per day is about $1.60 — less than a coffee.
2. **Initial Detox Symptoms** The first few days of discomfort scared me, but Prime Biome’s team explained it’s normal. It passed quickly, and looking back, it was my body adjusting to real gut healing.
3. **It’s Not Sold in Stores** I wish it was in Walgreens or Whole Foods. But I guess the company wants to control quality and avoid fakes. That’s why I only buy from their **\[official website\]** — fast shipping and fresh stock.

# ✅ Why I Recommend Prime Biome to Everyone

If you’ve ever struggled with:

* Chronic bloating
* Inconsistent bowel movements
* Brain fog and fatigue
* Sugar cravings
* Skin breakouts linked to gut issues
* Anxiety or mood swings...

… then **Prime Biome** could be the missing piece.

This is **not just another probiotic** — it’s a **scientifically formulated gut repair system** that works with your body, not against it. The soil-based organisms, enzyme blend, and anti-inflammatory agents are what make it unique.

And here’s the kicker — **it comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee**. So even if it doesn’t work for you, there’s zero risk.

# ⭐ Final Verdict: Is Prime Biome Worth It?

Yes. A thousand times YES.

I’ve tried over 12 gut products in the last 5 years. None of them made a difference long-term. Prime Biome is the only supplement that delivered visible, emotional, and digestive transformation — and continues to work **4 months in**.

Don’t waste another year feeling sluggish, bloated, and helpless.

This is your sign to take control of your gut health today — your body will thank you, your mind will feel clearer, and you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner.

👉 **My advice? Get the 3-bottle bundle**. You’ll save money, have enough to truly see results, and you’re covered with their refund policy anyway.

Your gut deserves healing.  
Your life deserves vitality.  
**Prime Biome might just be the answer.**",1,1746118306.0,TheCosmicWheelSister,0,0.66,False

“João das Castanholas: The Timber Testament”
A (mostly) true tale from the hills of Northern Portugal

A long time ago, in a quiet village nestled in the rolling hills of the Minho region, lived a man named João Madeira. João was a proud woodworker — not just any woodworker, mind you, but one of the finest carvers in all the land. People came from all over to buy his intricately carved spoons, chairs, and once, even a wooden hat (it was not a bestseller).

But one day, while shaping a rather large piece of oak for a rocking chair, a terrible accident occurred. Let’s just say — his chisel slipped, and the two most treasured acorns in his personal forest were… well, logged.

The village healer, Senhora Benta, patched him up the best she could. But João was never quite the same. Not because of the pain — he had the heart of a bull and the patience of a saint — but because he missed the… swing of things.

Being a resourceful man, João went back to his workshop and decided, “If nature won’t give, then by timber I shall receive!” He crafted two perfect spheres out of polished chestnut wood, varnished them to a shine, and wore them as proud prosthetics, suspended neatly in a hemp pouch.

Now João lived in the upper floor of a two-storey cottage, and every morning he’d jog downstairs for coffee and chorizo. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK! went the wooden baubles as he bounced down the steps. CLACK-CLACK! as he returned.

His downstairs neighbour, Tiago Ramos, a sprightly folk dancer with more scarves than common sense, was perplexed. One day, he stuck his head out of his window and shouted,
“Ó João! What in the name of Saint Carpintor is that beautiful rhythm I hear every morning?”

João, always honest, replied with a wink, “That, meu amigo, is the sound of my manhood reinvented.”

Curious (and a bit confused), Tiago asked to see them. João, never shy, dropped his trousers right there in the middle of the street.

Tiago gasped, then clapped. “Bravo! Bravo! They’re musical! They’ve got rhythm! They’ve got soul! João, may I borrow your balls for my next dance?”

After some thought (and a firm no to borrowing the originals), João carved a smaller, handheld version — two wooden shells joined by a string. Tiago danced with them at the next village festa. The people were enchanted by the clackety-clack-clack, and soon every dancer wanted a pair of João’s “clacking cojones.”

Of course, they couldn’t call them that forever. So, with a wink and a nod, the villagers named the instruments castanholas — “little chestnuts.”

And thus, Portugal’s most rhythmic instrument was born — not from music, not from tradition, but from the unfortunate but inspired groin of a man named João Madeira.

To this day, in quiet villages, if you listen closely to the sound of castanets, you’ll hear not just music — but the echo of a legend who turned tragedy into timbered triumph.

Have you ever sat down to work, only to find your brain feeling like a wet sponge? It's like your thoughts are stuck in traffic and there's no way to speed things up! 🚦 Trust me, I’ve been there more times than I can count. 

**But here’s a little nugget I stumbled upon** that can really make a difference: *habit stacking.* You know, that magical trick where you pair a new habit with an existing one? It’s like giving your brain a coffee break every time you hit a mental wall!

**Here’s my go-to 10-second trick you can try:**  

1. **Pair it with a routine**: Think about something you already do every day. Brushing your teeth? Perfect. Every time you grab that toothbrush, take a moment to do a quick 10-second mindfulness check. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and focus on *nothing but your breath*. 

2. **Turn up some tunes**: Next time you find yourself stuck in mental fog, crank your favorite upbeat song as you wash your hands. That combo of rhythm and focus can clear your head like nothing else!

3. **Hydrate & meditate**: Every time you take a sip of water, give your mind a mini break. 10 seconds of simply being present as the cool water hits your lips can refresh your mental state. It’s a hydration party for your brain! 🎉

4. **Stretch it out**: While you’re waiting for that microwave meal to heat up, hit a quick 10-second stretch. Feel those muscles wake up and gently shake off the clouds in your brain.

Now, I know what you might be thinking: “10 seconds? That can’t possibly help!” But here’s the kicker – our brains thrive on routine, and even small shifts can make the biggest waves in our productivity and clarity.

And hey, who doesn’t want to feel a little more present and less foggy? Maybe you’ll start seeing those ideas flow again, and those creative juices might just start flowing without a hitch! 

So, what are your go-to tricks for dispelling mental fog? Any wild combos you're willing to share? Let’s swap ideas and keep the fog at bay together! 🌤️",1,1746118233.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

She's nice enough and we seemed to get a long at first, but she has literally been late to or cancelled every single attempt at hanging out. With the exception of her babysitting our baby when I was going to therapy for PPD, which she was on time for. She did cancel babysitting on two occasions and got my mil to stand in for her instead, which was considerate.

Since our son was born 14 months ago, she has been wanting to visit our house more and more to have a relationship with him. That's great. I'm pro that. But she's always 1-3 hours late getting to our house to see him. It started to feel like she didn't value my time because I'm a stay-at-home mom and what am I doing anyway? I told her that, she apologized and promised to try harder and said that my time is valued and important. 

Well, a few months went by and nothing changed. She always had excuses as to why she was going to be late or why she had to cancel. So a week ago she wanted to make plans to get together and I told her we could meet somewhere near her house (we're 20 minutes away from her) and have my son play at a playground and then go grab some food. 

That was supposed to be yesterday. Around 2:30 I get a text asking to move the time we met up from 3:00 to 3:15. Okay, no problem. I can do that. I even had coerced my son into taking an early nap so he would be happy and energetic when we were going to meet up with her. 3:15 was doable. 

At 3pm she texts that she had a hard therapy appointment that she was on her way from and she needed to go home to use the bathroom. Okay, that's great. Still 15 minutes and she lives 3 minutes from the meetup spot. No prob. 

3:37 I get a text saying she's going to need a minute because it was just so hard and she's having a rough time. I mentally tell myself that at 3:50 we're leaving and we're going to go do something else. 3:50 rolls around and I text her I hope she feels better but my son and I are leaving.

I don't hear from her again until 4:15. She says she had a panic attack and she was trying to get herself together and she didn't know how much time had gone by. I told her I would understand if this had been the first, second, or even third time this had happened, but that it's been an every time thing. I thanked her for being on time to babysitting in the past and told her I was sorry she was having a rough day.

It turned into a barrage of texts about how she hates herself and her life is a mess and that I should be angry with her because she hates herself so much and how everyone just leaves her and she's a failure and she's so so sorry and her ex boyfriend told her he loved her but that was just lies and her best friends stopped talking to her and there is nothing she can do. Bad things keep happening to her and nothing in her life is in her control.

I didn't know what to say. I told her we loved her and cared about her and that she is very important and left it at that. She texted she doesn't know how to fix this and honestly, going over it all, I'm not even sure what actually happened. I feel like I have constantly been there for her to unload on every time she's struggling, but now that I'm a mom, I feel like I don't have the time to walk through everything she's dealing with all the time. 

TL;DR Sister in law is constantly late. I left a meetup with my toddler after she was 40 minutes late getting there and she texted me saying she hated herself and how bad her life was and that I should be angry with her and that nothing in her life is in her control.

1kcdh89,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kcdh89/close_quarters_closer_secrets/,"Close Quarters, Closer Secrets","The night her husband’s brother moved in, Miss Velvet didn’t flinch. She opened the door like a hostess—poised, perfect, and utterly untouchable.

“It’s just for a few weeks,” the cuck had said.
Flooded basement. Insurance claims. All very boring.

Velvet had only smiled.

Of course he could stay.
Of course they had space.

Their guest stepped inside with that cocky charm she remembered from their wedding. Her husband’s younger brother—more athletic, taller, just a little smug in that way that said he knew exactly how good he looked in a fitted tee. He greeted her with a lopsided grin and a duffel bag slung over one shoulder.

“Still stunning, huh?” he said under his breath.

She didn’t respond—not with words. Just a lingering look down his body, one brow lifted. A smirk. That was enough.

She saw the way his eyes flicked to her legs. The way his throat worked when she turned to lead him upstairs, her heels sharp against the wood, her hips swaying just enough to tempt but never confirm.

He followed.

Of course he did.

⸻

The first few days were harmless.

Miss Velvet didn’t change her routine. She still walked around in robes that slipped open at the thigh. Still lounged on the couch with her legs curled beneath her. Still kissed her husband on the cheek before sending him off to work—patting the back of his head like a loyal little pet.

The brother—let’s call him Marcus—noticed.
Of course he noticed.

“Is it always like this here?” he asked one afternoon, catching her as she returned from yoga, sports bra clinging to sweat-slick curves.

“Like what?” she replied, reaching slowly for her water bottle. Her arm lifted, giving him a clear view of her bare waistline. No bra strap. Just a hint of underboob. Meant for him.

He chuckled, eyes lingering.

“Like a damn fantasy.”

She didn’t correct him.

⸻

It started with accidents.

A shared glance across the dinner table while her cuck was rambling about spreadsheets.
A brush of fingers when Marcus reached past her for the salt.
A quiet moment in the laundry room when she stepped too close—just to see if he’d step back.

He didn’t.

⸻

The first real betrayal happened in the hallway.

It was late. The cuck had gone to bed early—headache, probably from trying to pretending to be a real man.

She was walking toward the kitchen when Marcus stepped out of the guest room shirtless. Boxers. Nothing else. Broad chest. Confident smirk. That same casual swagger, like he didn’t give a damn about the rules of her house.

“Can’t sleep,” he muttered.

She didn’t answer. Just watched him.

“Maybe it’s the way your heels echo down this hallway. Hard to relax when I know you’re walking around like that.”

Her robe slipped off one shoulder.

“Then don’t sleep.”

He stepped closer.

Close enough to touch.
Close enough to smell her perfume—dark, floral, dangerous.
His hand hovered at her waist.

She didn’t flinch. She leaned in. Her breath warmed the shell of his ear.

“My husband is asleep… just down the hall.”

Marcus swallowed.

“That supposed to stop me?”

“No,” she purred. “It’s supposed to turn you on.”

She kissed him.

Brief. Hot. Forbidden.

Then she walked away.

⸻

From then on, the teasing wasn’t subtle.

He started brushing past her in the mornings, shirtless, just as she came downstairs in silk robes that barely clung to her curves.
She bent lower to get things from cabinets.
He sat closer on the couch.

Sometimes, she let her leg rest against his for just a second too long.
Sometimes, she touched his wrist when she laughed—soft and deliberate.

Her cuck never noticed.

Not even the night she “accidentally” wore her sheerest panties beneath a paper-thin nightgown and lingered a little too long in the kitchen, lit only by the fridge light, pouring Marcus a glass of water.

⸻

One night, everything shifted.

She was already in bed, her cuck snoring softly beside her, when she heard the guest room door creak.

The air shifted. Like a current of something unspeakable was about to pull her under.

She didn’t move.
Not at first.

She felt the mattress dip behind her. Slowly. Carefully.

A warm breath brushed the back of her neck.

Marcus.

He had slipped into the bed.

Right behind her.
Right next to her snoring husband.
Close enough to make her heart race in a way she hadn’t felt in years.

She didn’t stop him.

His hand was cautious at first—just resting on the curve of her hip over the covers. Waiting.

She gave him permission with a single backward press of her body. A silent, wicked encouragement.

The hand moved.

Lower.

Inside the covers.

Fingers grazing the bare skin of her thigh.

She bit her lip.

He slipped closer, pressing his body to hers—hard, unmistakably aroused.

Her cuck stirred beside her. Murmured something. Rolled over.

They both froze.

But he didn’t wake up.

Marcus’s hand resumed its exploration. This time slower, bolder. His lips brushed her shoulder.

Velvet let out the quietest exhale—pleasure and power and risk all tangled together.

She reached behind her, blindly, until she found what she was looking for. Her fingers wrapped around his cock. Hard. Thick.

The contrast made her dizzy.

She squeezed once—possessively. Silently.

Then she let go.

No more.

Not yet.

Just enough to make him ache.

She shifted away and whispered one word without turning her head.

“Go.”

Marcus hesitated.

But he obeyed.

⸻

The next morning, she served breakfast like nothing had happened.

Eggs. Toast. Coffee. Her robe tied tight, her expression unreadable.

The cuck blinked blearily at his plate, completely unaware.

Marcus sat across from her, eyes low, a slow grin spreading across his face as she licked a smear of yolk from her fingertip and let her tongue linger just a moment too long.

“Sleep well?” she asked.

The cuck nodded.

“Like a baby.”

Marcus met her gaze and raised his coffee mug.

“I had the best night of my life.”

I went to the doctor's a few weeks ago and was diagnosed with baker's lung and given an inhaler to help out and was instructed to wear a respirator at work. 

Freshly roasted beans give off carbon monoxide and that in combination with the ground particulate agitated my throat to the point where I was coughing so hard I was throwing up. My work has zero ventilation to help with the off gas from the beans and when using a carbon monoxide detector near the beans the levels go up 3000+ppm.

Hi guys! I noticed this lump inside of my lower jaw, right under the root of one of my teeth. I first became aware of it about a month ago, but the area had been feeling sensitive since around February, so it might have been there for longer without me realizing it.

Right now, it doesn’t hurt, sometimes during the day I feel something there, but I wouldn’t call it pain. If I had to rate it, the discomfort would be a 2 out of 10. The size hasn’t changed at all since I first noticed it. It’s neither growing nor shrinking.

I drink alcohol on the weekends, coffee everyday, and haven't smoked in a year. 

I haven’t seen a dentist in years due to financial reasons, and I know my teeth aren’t in good shape, there’s definitely some work that needs to be done. I feel pretty embarrassed about the condition of my mouth, which is also making it hard to go get help, but I plan to schedule an appointment for the next week.

In the meantime, I’d really appreciate any thoughts on what this could be. Thank you in advance!

I acted instinctively, throwing the piping hot coffee onto his face.

I apologized and saw my mom coming in to see half his face red and me with an empty cup of coffee. I started crying because I was scared and he had to get the burns checked out, and I began getting texts from family I don't even know.

1kcd460,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kcd460/the_echo_of_silence/,The Echo of Silence,"Part I: The First Cut

Detective Michael Reeves stood in the rain, watching as the coroner zipped up the body bag. The victim—Abigail Monroe, 37, local music teacher—lay peacefully, almost serene if not for the grotesque wound across her throat. It wasn't just cut; it was hollowed out. Her vocal cords had been surgically removed with disturbing precision.

""Same as the others,"" Dr. Wallace said, peeling off her gloves. ""Cause of death is blood loss from the throat laceration, but the removal of the vocal cords happened while she was still alive.""

Mike grunted in acknowledgment, rain dripping from his unshaven face. Three victims in three weeks in Oakhollow—a town so small most maps forgot it existed. This kind of violence didn't happen here. Not in the place he'd grown up in, left, and reluctantly returned to five years ago after his divorce.

""You get anything from the neighbors?"" he asked Officer Peterson, a young cop who looked like he might puke any minute.

""Same as the Nichols and Dawson cases,"" Peterson replied, voice shaky. ""She lived alone. No signs of forced entry. But..."" he hesitated.

""Spit it out.""

""Her sister mentioned something weird. Said Abigail called her three days ago, freaked out about hearing whispers in her house. Said it sounded like voices telling her things nobody should know.""

Mike felt a chill that had nothing to do with the rain. ""What kind of things?""

""Secrets. Stuff from her past. Things she'd never told anyone.""

""Fuck,"" Mike muttered. That was new—and disturbing.

Back at the station, Mike pinned Abigail's photo beside the others on the board. Tom Nichols, 42, bartender. Eliza Dawson, 29, nurse. Now Abigail Monroe, 37, music teacher. No obvious connections except they all lived alone and all died the same way: throats cut, vocal cords removed.

Chief Harris watched from the doorway, arms crossed. ""Three murders in three weeks. We've had three murders in the last thirty years. The mayor's breathing down my neck. I need something, Mike.""

Mike rubbed his bloodshot eyes. ""I know. I'm working on it.""

""Work harder. This town's about to tear itself apart with fear.""

After Harris left, Mike pulled out his notebook. Three victims. Three weeks. Something about the pattern nagged at him. He flipped through the files, searching for anything he might have missed. His phone buzzed with a text from his ex-wife about their daughter's upcoming visit. He ignored it.

One detail kept coming back. All three victims had reportedly heard whispers in the days before their deaths. He'd initially dismissed it as pre-murder paranoia, but now it seemed significant. What if they'd actually heard something—or someone?

The station was nearly empty at 2 AM when Mike finally headed home. The rain had stopped, leaving Oakhollow shrouded in mist. His headlights cut through it as he drove past the abandoned Whispering Pines Asylum on the outskirts of town—a Victorian monstrosity that had closed in the 80s after patient abuse scandals. Local kids claimed it was haunted. Mike had always thought that was bullshit.

His house was dark and quiet. Too quiet. He'd never gotten used to the silence after his wife and daughter left. He poured himself two fingers of whiskey and collapsed onto the couch, case files spread around him.

Sleep came reluctantly, and when it did, he dreamed of throats opening like bloody smiles and whispers just beyond hearing.

Morning brought no clarity, just a hangover and the realization he'd fallen asleep on his couch again. Mike showered, threw on yesterday's clothes, and headed back to the station, stopping for coffee at Dale's Diner.

The waitress, Jenny, gave him a worried smile. ""You look like shit, Mike.""

""Thanks. You really know how to make a guy feel special.""

She poured his coffee. ""Everyone's talking about the murders. Is it true someone's cutting out people's voice boxes?""

""You know I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.""

Jenny leaned in. ""My cousin works at the hospital. She said the bodies were... weird. Like they'd been operated on by a doctor.""

""Your cousin should keep her mouth shut before she loses her job.""

""Hey, I'm just saying what everyone's thinking. This isn't some random killer, is it? This is... something else.""

Mike left without responding. Something else. That phrase followed him to the station, where a new report waited on his desk. A woman named Laura Simmons had called to report hearing whispers in her home.

Mike was at her door within twenty minutes.

Laura Simmons lived in a small blue house on Maple Street. She was in her early thirties, dark-haired and nervous, fingers constantly twisting a pendant around her neck.

""I know it sounds crazy,"" she said after inviting him in. ""But I keep hearing these... whispers. At night, mostly. They know things, Detective. Things about me.""

""What kind of things?"" Mike asked, notebook ready.

Laura's eyes darted around the room. ""Secrets. Mistakes I've made. Things I've never told anyone.""

A chill ran up Mike's spine. ""When did this start?""

""Three days ago. I thought it was just the pipes or something at first. But then..."" She shuddered. ""Then it started saying names. My sister's name. My ex's name. It knew about the abortion I had in college. Nobody knows about that. Nobody.""

Mike wrote everything down, trying to keep his hand steady. ""Have you seen anything unusual? Anyone hanging around your house?""

She shook her head. ""No. Nothing like that. But sometimes, I feel like someone's watching me. And last night, I woke up and there was this smell—like old medicine and... rot."" Her voice broke. ""I'm not crazy, Detective. I swear I'm not.""

""I don't think you're crazy, Ms. Simmons."" Mike handed her his card. ""Call me anytime, day or night. And maybe stay with a friend for a few days.""

""You think I'm in danger, don't you?""

Mike hesitated. ""I think it's better to be cautious right now.""

Back in his car, Mike called Peterson. ""I need you to put a patrol on Laura Simmons' house. Round-the-clock surveillance.""

""You think she's the next target?""

""I think I'm not taking any chances.""

That night, Mike found himself parked down the street from Laura's house. Peterson was on official watch, but Mike couldn't shake the feeling that something was going to happen. He sipped cold coffee and stared at her windows, watching shadows move behind curtains.

Around midnight, his radio crackled. ""Detective Reeves?"" It was Peterson.

""Go ahead.""

""I just did a perimeter check. Everything's quiet. Too quiet, actually. No crickets, no nothing.""

Mike frowned. ""I'm coming over.""

As he approached Laura's house, he noticed it too. The unnatural silence, as if sound itself was being swallowed up. He drew his gun and moved toward the front door.

""Peterson?"" he called softly.

No answer.

The door was unlocked. Mike pushed it open slowly, gun raised. ""Ms. Simmons? Officer Peterson? It's Detective Reeves.""

Silence greeted him. The living room was empty. So was the kitchen. But as he moved toward the hallway, he heard it—a soft, barely audible whispering.

""Peterson? Laura?""

The whispers grew louder as he approached the bedroom door. Not words, exactly, but something like words, slithering around the edges of his mind.

When he pushed open the bedroom door, the smell hit him first—coppery blood and something else, something old and rotten. Peterson lay on the floor, throat torn open, eyes staring at nothing. And on the bed...

Laura Simmons sat upright, eyes wide with terror, mouth moving but no sound coming out. Blood cascaded from the gaping wound in her throat. As Mike watched in horror, she toppled sideways onto the mattress.

""Fuck!"" Mike ran to her, pressing his hands against her throat, trying to stop the bleeding, but it was too late. She was gone. And Peterson too.

Mike called it in, hands shaking. As he waited for backup, he noticed something carved into the wall above the bed. A simple symbol: a circle with a line through it. Like a mouth sewn shut.

By dawn, the house was crawling with cops and forensic techs. Mike stood on the porch, watching the body bags being loaded into ambulances. Chief Harris was beside him, face grim.

""Two victims this time,"" Harris said. ""Including one of our own. This is getting out of hand, Mike.""

""I was right here,"" Mike said, voice hollow. ""Right outside the goddamn house.""

""You couldn't have known.""

""I should have been faster. I heard the whispers too, Chief. Right before I found them.""

Harris looked at him sharply. ""What whispers?""

Mike hesitated. ""Nothing. Just... nothing.""

Later, alone in the morgue, Mike stared at the bodies. Peterson's death had been quick—throat slashed from behind, vocal cords intact. But Laura's was like the others. Throat opened, vocal cords meticulously extracted.

""It's like they're being harvested,"" Dr. Wallace said, stating what they were both thinking.

""For what purpose?"" Mike asked.

Dr. Wallace shrugged. ""Some sick trophy collection? Black market organ thing? Hell if I know.""

But Mike was beginning to suspect this was something else entirely. Something worse.

Back at the station, he pulled up the old records on Whispering Pines Asylum. The building had been abandoned for decades, but people still talked about what had happened there. Experiments. Patients who disappeared. Sounds in the night.

He found an article from 1985, the year before the asylum closed. ""Controversial Treatment Methods Questioned at Local Psychiatric Facility."" It mentioned a Dr. Marcus Reid, who had been developing ""sonic therapy"" for patients with severe mental disorders. The therapy involved ""extracting negative energies through vocal vibrations.""

The picture showed a gaunt man with hollow eyes and a thin smile. Something about his face made Mike's skin crawl.

Further digging revealed that after the asylum closed, Dr. Reid had disappeared. No records of him existed after 1986. He'd vanished, along with five patients who were never accounted for.

Mike printed out Reid's photo and pinned it to his board. It wasn't much, but it was something. A lead, finally. He needed to check out the asylum.

Whispering Pines loomed against the darkening sky as Mike pulled up to its rusted gates. The three-story Victorian building was a looming shadow in the twilight, its windows like blind eyes.

He knew he should wait for backup, should call this in. But something pushed him forward, a certainty that answers waited inside.

The front doors were chained but had been forced open recently. Mike slipped through, flashlight cutting through the darkness. The entrance hall was vast, with a grand staircase leading to upper floors. Graffiti covered the walls, and trash littered the floor—evidence of teenage visitors over the years.

Mike moved carefully, gun drawn. ""Hello?"" he called. ""Anyone here?""

*Michael...*

He spun around, heart racing. ""Who's there?""

But there was only silence.

The first floor yielded nothing but empty rooms and decay. The second floor was mostly patient quarters—small cells with bare metal bed frames. But it was the third floor that drew him, some instinct pulling him upward.

The administrative offices were there, including what must have been Dr. Reid's office. The door was locked, but Mike broke it open with his shoulder.

Inside, time seemed to have stopped. Unlike the rest of the asylum, this room was pristine. No dust. No decay. Books lined the shelves. Papers were stacked neatly on the desk. And on the wall hung a framed photograph of Dr. Reid standing with five orderlies—or what Mike had assumed were orderlies. Looking closer, he realized they weren't staff at all. They were patients, identifiable by the vacant looks in their eyes.

Below the photo, a journal lay open on the desk. Mike picked it up, flashlight illuminating the neat handwriting:

*The entity responds to vocal vibrations. Speech, singing, screaming—all serve to strengthen it. But it requires a direct conduit. The vocal cords must be prepared properly. Fresh. Alive. Only then can the Silent One channel through them.*

*The procedure is delicate. The subject must be conscious. They must feel their voice being taken. Only then does the energy transfer properly.*

*We are close now. The five conduits are ready. Soon, the Silent One will speak through us, and we shall know its wisdom.*

Mike felt sick. What the hell had they been doing here? Some kind of cult? Human sacrifice?

He flipped through more pages, finding detailed diagrams of vocal cords and surgical procedures that made his stomach turn. The final entry was dated June 15, 1986:

*Tonight, we call it forth. The ritual is prepared. The Silent One has whispered its instructions. We five shall be its voice in this world. Through us, it will sing. Through us, it will silence.*

That was it. No more entries. Whatever happened that night was unrecorded.

Mike was about to put the journal down when he noticed a symbol stamped on the back cover—a circle with a line through it. The same symbol that had been carved above Laura Simmons' bed.

*Hello, Detective.*

The whisper came from directly behind him. Mike whirled, gun raised, but the office was empty.

*You've been looking for us. How dedicated. How... vocal.*

The whisper seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. Mike backed toward the door. ""Who are you? Show yourself!""

Laughter, soft and sibilant, filled the room.

*We are the Silent One. We've been watching you, Michael. We've heard your voice. Strong. Resonant. Full of... fear.*

Mike felt a cold presence moving around him, like invisible fingers tracing his skin.

*You speak to the dead in your dreams, don't you, Michael? You call to your brother. The one who drowned while you watched. You were only ten. Not your fault. But oh, how you've blamed yourself.*

""Shut up,"" Mike hissed. ""You don't know shit about me.""

*We know everything about you. We hear all voices, eventually. Even the silent ones. Especially those.*

Something moved in the shadows behind the desk. A figure, tall and thin, stepped partially into the beam of Mike's flashlight. It looked like a man—like Dr. Reid from the photograph—but wrong somehow. Too tall. Too still. Its face was mostly hidden in shadow, but its mouth was visible, stretched in an impossibly wide smile.

*You want to know why we take their voices, Detective? Because silence is purity. Silence is peace. These humans—they fill the world with noise. Meaningless chatter. Lies. Deceit. We silence the liars. We harvest their voices to strengthen our own.*

Mike fired his gun. The figure jerked backward into the shadows.

*That was rude, Detective.*

The whisper came from behind him now. Mike spun again, firing into darkness.

Suddenly, the whispers were everywhere, overlapping, a cacophony of hissing voices:

*We were trapped here for so long. Bound by Reid and his followers. They thought they could control us. Use us. But we consumed them instead. Took their voices. Made them our first disciples.*

*And now we're free. The town called to us. So many voices. So much guilt. So many secrets.*

*You freed us, Michael. When you came back to town five years ago. Your grief. Your guilt. Your voice in the night, screaming for forgiveness. It was the key to our prison.*

Mike backed out of the office, firing again and again until his gun clicked empty. The whispers followed him down the hallway.

*Run, Detective. Run and tell them. But who will believe you? You'll just be another crazy man hearing voices.*

Mike ran. Down the stairs, through the entrance hall, out into the night. He didn't stop until he reached his car, lungs burning, sweat pouring down his face despite the cold.

As he fumbled with his keys, a final whisper reached him:

*We'll be seeing you soon, Michael. We like your voice. So full of pain. So full of power.*",1,1746117192.0,scarystories,3,0.67,False

1kcd32i,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1kcd32i/urinary_problems_eliminated_when_i_quit_zyn/,Urinary problems eliminated when I quit ZYN,"I am 71 year old male, and have been using some form of nicotine since 2010. The last 3 years has been pouches. About a can a day or every day and a half. I have had all kinds of urinary stuff going on but I attributed it to prostate and/or lots of coffee every day along with tons of water. 

I had very frequent trips to the toilet. Sense of urgency and then just a trickle. Sometimes at night I would get up 3 or 4 times because of limited flow and not being able to empty my bladder in one or two trips. Painful and difficult to pee quite often. Total nonsense.

Long story short, I had to have a tumor removed from my spinal cord. A benign Schwannoma. 2.5 cm. During the process the surgeon had to remove bone and then fuse my L4 and L5. The spinal fusion required me to lay off the nicotine for a few months because it causes vasoconstriction which inhibits bone healing and growth. This was an easy decision for me to make. As hard as it may be to believe, I am otherwise very fit. Keto (mostly meat) diet and work out 4 days a week. I was not about to jeopardize my spinal healing over a bad habit.

I had the surgery on 11/13/2024 and quit nicotine 7 days before the surgery. Today is May 1, 2025 and still have not had any nicotine. I still crave it for about 30 seconds at trigger moments during the day. I just remind myself of how nicely my healing process is going. I'm back in the gym and progressing well.

But the best part is, I piss like a racehorse now. Absolutely no problem with the flow. Literally like when I was in my twenties. Now I suppose it's possible that there was pressure on nerves that effected my bladder function but I am more inclined to blame it on the nicotine. The restricted flow has gradually improved over the last 6 months since the surgery with the greatest amount of improvement noticed in the last couple months. 

So for what it's worth that's my story.

*“Dr. Cale, I know I said I was going to start meditating… but then my dog looked at me funny, and somehow Netflix just… happened.”*

Or, *“I absolutely planned to go to bed early — but then I got hungry, and then Instagram needed me, and well, here we are.”*

It’s charming, it’s human… and it’s utterly predictable. We all know what would make life better. Most people don’t need a shrink to tell them what’s best to do! But somehow, despite our best promises, we don’t always follow through.

Let’s talk about why — and more importantly, what you can do about it.

**Why We Don’t Do What We Know is Good for Us**

**Our brains chase immediate rewards.**  
Your brain is wired to prioritize comfort and pleasure right now. It evolved to snag the quick win (food, shelter) rather than invest in long-term benefits. That’s why watching another episode feels easier than working out, even if you *know* better.

**Feelings hijack our best intentions.**  
We often consult our emotions to decide what to do. If we feel tired, stressed, or unmotivated — which, let’s be honest, happens often — we delay or avoid doing what’s good for us. Emotions are valuable, but they are unreliable guides for long-term goals. I talked about this last week!

**Old habits win by default.** Research shows most of our behavior is automatic, not nearly as thought-out as we like to believe. We ARE creatures of habit. Thus, without clear, consistent effort to build new habits, the old, comfortable ones keep running the show — even if they’re making us miserable.

**Waiting for motivation is a trap.** Motivation is unpredictable and fleeting. It’s not the cause of action — it’s the result. Those who succeed act *first*, often without feeling ready, and find that motivation grows after movement begins.

**In short:** Your brain is like a well-meaning but slightly irresponsible roommate. It wants the cookie, the nap, the binge-watch — and it will offer you a thousand creative reasons why *later* is better than *now.* If you don’t learn to take charge lovingly but firmly, you’ll find yourself surrounded by broken promises, unopened gym memberships, and half-finished self-help books.

But don’t worry — it’s fixable. Let’s talk about how to outsmart that mischievous roommate and start doing what actually makes life better.

**How to Start Doing What You Know is Good for You**

Here are a few powerful strategies you can put into practice immediately:

**1. Honor Intentions, Not Feelings.** Decide that your word to yourself matters. If you said you’d walk at 6 PM, you walk — regardless of whether you feel tired, grumpy, or “just not into it.” Treat your promises like contracts.

**2. Make the First Step Tiny.** Lower the bar to start. Don’t commit to a five-mile run. Commit to tying your shoes. Don’t commit to meditating for 30 minutes. Commit to sitting quietly for one minute. Small beginnings overcome the brain’s inertia.

**3. Link New Habits to Old Ones.** Pair new behaviors with existing routines: journal right after morning coffee, stretch after brushing your teeth. Habit stacking makes new behaviors automatic faster.

**4. Embrace Discomfort as Normal.** Expect that doing good things for yourself will often feel uncomfortable at first. That discomfort isn’t a sign you’re failing; it’s a sign you’re winning. Growth happens just beyond the edge of comfort. Please remember this key point!

**5. Celebrate the Effort, Not Just the Result.** Progress isn’t perfection. Celebrate the action itself — showing up, trying, moving forward — and you’ll build positive momentum, even through messy days.

**Final Thoughts: Real Change Is Within Reach**

If you stick with it — tiny step by tiny step — change is inevitable. Most of the real change in life is incremental, despite our brains wanting the fast, amazing results. The life you want isn’t built in grand gestures or perfect days. It’s built in those small, brave moments when you act, even when you don’t feel like it.

And sometimes, when the brain feels stuck in old patterns, **neurofeedback** can help. At **Capital District Neurofeedback**, we offer gentle, proven training to help optimize focus, motivation, and follow-through.

Keep going, don't stop. A little bit each day will add up. I can attest to this because I started out of shape, with high blood pressure, snoring like a bear, and not in a good place.

**Preliminaries:** I'm trying to post once a month and check in regularly with the progress everyone is achieving. I want to say that it's motivating reading all the various experiences. The primary cause of my weight gain over the past few years are inactivity, enjoying too many chips, and a drink here or there. My son gets married in June and I said, 'I want to make a change and enjoy that wedding.' Also, i've been athletic my entire life (Played football, soccer, etc.) and somehow when the 40's arrived, I slowed down a ton.

**Decision:** No Mas! I'm going to enjoy my son's wedding in mid June. Subscribed to Fella, took the option of the injections & would work out and change what I eat.

*Here are some details that can perhaps aid you in your journey*.

**Details:** Male, (6 foot 2in)

**Scale:** Started 3/1/2025 at 339 lbs , This morning 5/1/2025 I'm at 304.0 lbs.

**Exercise:** I decided to change my life and so I went all out.

3 times a week at 6AM I do a HIIT routine at the park for 30 minutes. Jumping Jacks, Farmers Carry w/ Dumbells, Burpees, Situps, Medicine Ball Throws, 1/4 mile jog, body squats.

6 times a week I hit the gym for weightlifting. Mon&Thurs: Chest\\Biceps, Tue&Fri: Legs/Shoulders, Wed&Sat: Back\\Triceps

I sit at the office all day and decided that every day at hour or half hour i will do: Body Squats, Standing Knee Taps, Standing Crunches (each side.) The goal is to get 200 between 9 to 5.

**Food:** I drastically reduced carbs and sugars. No soda. I will have a cup of black coffee in the morning and have had some wine with dinner. Scrambled eggs, avocado, fruits, salads (especially spinach, kale and romaine are staples in the diet. I try to have 8-15 glasses a water a day. (I visit the bathroom a lot)

**Feelings/Thoughts:** After the first two weeks I felt normal without any side effects. I was looking for them during the initial phase but they never came with force. Right now i'm simply coasting and have been doing so since week one and a half.

**Goals: Five** goals

Goal 1: 300

Goal 2: 280

Goal 3: 260

Goal 4: 220

Goal 5: 210 - This will mean that I would I will be 20 pounds more than when i graduated from school.

1kcd0qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kcd0qj/not_enough_to_be_considered/,not enough to be considered,"hey, I don’t understand men.

I (F22) think there is some kind of pattern with the guys I’ve been seeing/ going on dates with and I’m trying to think what could be my problem.

most of the guys I met on dating apps, but in the past year I’ve been out with some others whom I met in projects/trainings/ friends of friends.

in the beginning of Feb I went out with a guy (M25) on a coffee/park date that lasted 4 hours or so, it seemed like we had fun and all, we actually kissed at the end and we exchanged @ for insta so we can see each other. he did not text me after I got home which I found a bit weird, but I texted him the next day and he replied really dry. he ghosted me for a week and got back with a message saying that he had fun with me, but did not felt the urge to text me back after the date and took it as a sign that we’re not a match.





Mid-late february I started talking with another guy (M26) who was a really bad texter, but we had long and complex messages about a lot of subjects and basically texted once a day, after a week or two I went out on a coffee date with him, I think that we stayed for less than 2 hours. the next day we went to see a movie at the cinema and had a drink after, and the next week after that we met for a coffee, went in a park and kissed at some point. anyway, it seemed like things were slowly going somewhere.
we went out a few times, cooked together, watched movies, did sleepovers, got somehow intimate, but did not have penetration sex, since I told him that I’d like him to get tested (which at some point he told me he did, but waited for the results)

after a month he seemed like he only asked me to come over to his place once a week and did not plan any other date, I tried telling him and purposing a few times more subtle and others more direct that we can go out and do other things, but he was mostly busy (last semester of the bachelor + work and other projects) and at some point I started to feel bad to ask again and I stopped from doing all the gestures and initiatives I wanted to do. he also started to text me even more rarely and I felt like I was picking crumbs of his time and effort. this was happening for almost a month. 

of course, every time we were together he was caring and considerate, even in his sleep asked me if I was alright, but that was just once a week with a text per day in between.  

this sunday I told him how I felt about the things I mentioned above and he asked me if my feelings for him have developed in the meantime. I told him that I can’t fall for nothing and he was inconsistent and I was somehow confused, because if he wanted he would’ve actually done something more, even when I told him that he could at least try to text me just a bit more. he said that it’s been a while since we had been seeing each other and usually by that time he would’ve known what he felt and he did not felt more for me. after he told me this I was feeling like I wasn’t enough for him to even considerate something else outside his place because he did not like me that much. I told him that’s probably the best to not see each other. He said that’s gonna be sad, but just accepted my decision and somehow comforted me, because the entire conversation was happening while we were cuddling, he run his fingers through my hair, kissed my forehead and things like this.

He told me the things he liked about me, the gestures and stuff he appreciated while we were together, that we had really nice conversations and physical chemistry that’s missing to other people and other stuff like this.

I was really vulnerable and don’t remember exactly what I told him, but I’m sure I’ve mentioned some things I was insecure about myself that I did not tell him before. Anyway, we stayed together for a few hours, kissed and made out and kissed more and I left. I thought I forgot something and got back, but we just kissed once again and I was gone after.

The next day he liked a story of mine I secretly wished he’d like. But it’s been 4 days since we don’t talk and I low-key miss him and want to see him again, but at the same time I know that people who’d genuinely like me would’ve made some efforts and I was not a considerated a priority into his life.

Idk, even if people seem to enjoy the interactions with me, to tell me they had a great time/ we had nice discussions/ I was a good kisser/ other compliments - something’s missing that I genuinely don’t know what is, but it’s making me feel like I’m enough to be liked or I’m not lovable

I take her home and kiss her at the front door like I did on that first date, and then I drive away.

\-

The governor's mansion looks like a bright livin’ thing in the fog. I’m goin’ to give a little more tonight. I have to. I can’t fix the truck and pay the bills.

Inside, all of them drink and feast and fornicate. Dressed to the nines and livin’ it up on all they take. There’s only two types of people in here, those who are about to give and those who want to become like those who take.

Those who take ceased to be people long ago.

\-

I leave with bite wounds on my neck and blood on my shirt. New scars.

I stumble to the truck. I’m worried they took too much this time, but the money they gave me is just enough for bills and the truck.

Be thankful for small favors.

I'm tagging along my husband's work trip (free hotel!) and I'll have a few days to explore the city. We actually live in California but don't get to SF much. I'm thrilled to have a few days to explore the city solo. 

My priorities are exploring museums (mostly modern/contemporary art), shopping at boutiques/consignment, good coffee (I like light roast, enjoy pourovers), nice cocktails, and diverse food. We live in an area that has very little ethnically diverse food options, so I'm hoping to try some new things. I'm happy using rideshare to get around (won't have a car). 

A little more about searching for diverse food: my area has plenty of Italian, sushi, Thai, Mexican, and Mediterranean, but very little else. I'd love recommendations on where I could fit in other cuisines I don't normally have access to! 

  
Here is my itinerary so far and questions are in *italics.* I appreciate any help or tips! 

  
**Day 1, Sunday.** Land around noon, get to hotel in Japantown. 

Afternoon: Kabuki spa (booked)   
Evening: Grab Nijiya market food 

**Day 2, Monday.**

Morning: n*ot sure about breakfast, would love to get a pastry and a coffee somewhere in Japantown or near SF MOMA*  
SF MOMA (\~10 AM - 1 PM); *Lunch recommendation nearby? or go back to Japantown for lunch?*   
Afternoon: Fillmore St shopping   
Evening: Dumpling Story for dinner 

**Day 3, Tuesday.**

1kccvrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1kccvrv/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/,"No game today, so let's remember a forgotten Yankee: Duffy Lewis","> ""A funny fellow was Duffy Lewis. One of the pleasantest, squarest, friendliest fellows in baseball, he had more friends than any player I ever knew. He had a fad for dress too -- and he certainly was the clothes horse of the league. His neckties used to be the envy of everyone on the circuit, and I never saw him when he didn't look as though he had just stepped out of a tailor shop."" -- Babe Ruth, *Babe Ruth's Own Book of Baseball* (1928) 
 
On this date in 1920, in the Yankees' 13th game of the season, [Duffy Lewis](https://i.imgur.com/EmtoeKD.jpeg) hit his first home run of the year. 
 
But it wasn't really noticed, because it immediately followed someone else's first home run as a Yankee: Babe Ruth! 
 
But Lewis had not only witnessed Ruth's first home run as a Yankee. He also had witnessed Ruth's first home run in the major leagues. He was Ruth's teammate on the Red Sox when, on [May 6, 1915](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA191505060.shtml), the Babe -- who had pitched two scoreless innings to begin the game -- hit a home run to lead off the top of the third inning off [previously forgotten Yankee Jack Warhop](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/vr65z9/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). (The Yankees eventually won the game, 4-3, in the bottom of the 13th.) 
 
And Lewis also witnessed Ruth's *last* home run in the majors! Duffy was a coach on the Boston Braves when, on [May 25, 1935](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT193505250.shtml), Ruth blasted three home runs against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Babe announced his retirement a week later. 
 
But Lewis had a colorful career before, during, and after his time in the Babe's big shadow. 
 
[George Edward Lewis](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lewisdu01.shtml) -- Duffy, his mother's maiden name, was his nickname since childhood -- The [1906 San Francisco Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake) happened on his 18th birthday, April 18, 1906. ""I thought the whole world was coming to an end,"" Lewis later recalled. 
 
After graduating from Alameda High School, Lewis attended St. Mary's College for one year, then signed with an independent minor league team. After the 1909 season, in which Lewis hit .279 for the Oakland Oaks in the Pacific Coast League, he was signed personally by Red Sox owner John Taylor, who had seen him playing in a winter league out west. 
 
Lewis went to spring training with the Red Sox in 1910, but the soon-to-be 22-year-old rookie clashed with his teammates, who thought he was too cocky, and with his manager, who fined and benched him early in the season. Lewis finally got a chance to start in the ninth game of the season, and he went 1-for-4 with an RBI; the next day he played again, and had two doubles and a single. He pretty much played every day after that, and on the season hit .283/.328/.407, a robust 127 OPS+ by Deadball Era standards. 
 
Lewis quickly became a star for the Red Sox, and Boston's outfield of Lewis, Tris Speaker, and Harry Hooper -- [""the Golden Outfield""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Outfield), or sometimes the ""Million Dollar Outfield"" -- was regarded for a time as the best in baseball history. In eight seasons with the Red Sox, Duffy hit .289/.340/.395 (117 OPS+) in 4,892 plate appearances. 
 
But Lewis wasn't just a good hitter -- he also was renowned as one of the premier defensive players in baseball, and Hooper thought Lewis was even better than Speaker at running down balls hit over his head. Most famously, however, was his play around [""Duffy's Cliff""](https://np.reddit.com/r/dirtysportshistory/comments/1kcdh9e/19121933_fenway_park_had_a_steep_slope_in_left/). Long before there was the Green Monster, Fenway Park had [a 10-foot incline topped with a terrace at the base of the left field wall](https://www.spudart.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fenway-Park-left-field-once-featured-a-10-foot-incline-nicknamed-Duffys-Cliff-768x390.png). The terrace, nicknamed ""Duffy's Cliff"" in his honor, [could be used for seating for overcapacity crowds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Green_Monster_1914.jpg), but otherwise was in play. ""Duffy's Cliff"" was at Fenway from 1910 to 1933, when it was removed and replaced with the 37' wall that would eventually be called the Green Monster. 
 
Babe Ruth, or more likely his ghostwriter Bob Considine, wrote in *The Babe Ruth Story* (1948): 
 
> ""I can still see Duffy Lewis running up that cliff like a mountain goat, reaching out with his gloved or bare hand, and making impossible catches. I'll always remember that."" 
 
Lewis also appeared with the Red Sox in three World Series, hitting .299/.347/.463 in 77 plate appearances and winning three rings. His best series was in 1915, when he went 8-for-18 with a double, a home run, and five RBIs in the five-game series. 
 
Lewis went into the U.S. Navy during World War I, missing the entire 1918 season. He was discharged from the Navy after the World Series -- missing what would be a fourth ring with the Red Sox -- only to be traded to the Yankees, along with Dutch Leonard and Ernie Shore, for Frank Gilhooley, Al Walters, Ray Caldwell, and [previously forgotten Yankee Slim Love](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1ehgf80/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). It was the first, but not the most famous, of many trades made between Yankee owner Jacob Ruppert and Boston owner Harry Frazee, who sold the Red Sox in 1923 to focus on his Broadway endeavors. 
 
The deal also included New York sending $15,000 to Boston, but Leonard refused to report to the Yankees, and he was then sold to the Tigers for $12,000. Lewis, too, initially refused to report, but worked out a deal in time to be with the Yankees on Opening Day in 1919, against the Red Sox. He went 0-for-4 against his old team, presaging a disappointing season -- he hit just .272/.293/.365 (84 OPS+), though he did tie for the major league lead in games played with 141. (The 1919 season was shortened due to the Spanish Flu pandemic; most teams played 140 games that year.) He did, however, lead the Yankees in RBIs (89) and was tied for second on the team in home runs (7). 
 
It would be the last time that single digits would tie for second in home runs on the Yankees. 
 
After the 1919 season, the salary demands of Babe Ruth -- who had said he would hold out, or retire, or become an actor, or a professional prizefighter, or turn his annual winter barnstorming baseball tour into a year-round spectacle -- had finally grown too much for Boston owner Harry Frazee. He sold Ruth's contract to the Yankees for $125,000, a deal that at the time some believed was a huge mistake... by New York. 
 
But others, including Lewis, were delighted by the acquisition. After that disappointing 1919 season, the soon-to-be 32-year-old Duffy had talked about retiring. But he changed his mind when the Yankees acquired Ruth, praising his former teammate: 
 
> ""The club owners are to be congratulated upon getting Big Babe into the fold, for his tremendous walloping will just about give us a winning team. He was an ace in the cleanup hole for the Red Sox; he will be even greater with us. He will fill another need for us, too, in that he swings from the south side of the plate."" 
 
He also praised Ruth's work as an outfielder, saying he ""has given us defensive skill where we needed it most, and perhaps this year the games that went a-glimmering will be saved."" 
 
But most of all, Lewis said, Ruth was a good teammate. ""He's a big, gruff bear, but a good natured boy at heart. He would rather play ball than eat, and with the patronage of the New York fans to help him he will be a mighty important factor in our success."" 
 
But expectations for Ruth were sky high, and maybe too much even for Ruth's broad shoulders as over the first two weeks of the 1920 season he was 7-for-31 with eight strikeouts in nine games -- a .226/.250/.258 line. 
 
Meanwhile, Duffy -- who usually played left field while Ruth played right, though Ruth also saw time in left and even in center -- was having an even worse season, hitting .205/.239/.227 at the end of April. 
 
On [May 1](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA192005010.shtml), the sixth place Yankees (4-7) were playing the first place Red Sox (10-2) at the Polo Grounds, the Yankees' home stadium from 1913 to 1922. No doubt if /r/baseball was around back then, there'd be plenty of people saying the Red Sox had pulled a fast one on the Yankees with the Ruth sale. 
 
The Babe, batting fourth, came up in the bottom of the first with Wally Pipp on first base and one out. He promptly grounded back to pitcher Herb Pennock, a future Yankee. Pennock threw to second to force Pipp, and the next batter -- our pal Duffy -- grounded out to end the inning. 
 
Ruth came up again in the fourth, and this time he doubled down the right field line. Lewis then hit a grounder to third, and Ruth brazenly took third as Duffy was thrown out. Ruth's bold baserunning paid off again as he scampered home on a ground-out to shortstop by Del Pratt. 
 
In the bottom of the sixth, with the Yankees up 2-0, Ruth finally blasted his first home run as a Yankee, hitting one to deep right field. Lewis followed that up with a home run to left, but I imagine most of the fans were still buzzing about Ruth's blast. Duffy's home run was his only contribution in the 6-0 win, but Ruth had an RBI groundout in the seventh. 
 
From May 1 through the end of the season, Ruth hit an astounding .386/.548/.890, with 54 HR and 133 RBI! 
 
Lewis also finished strong, though of course not by Ruth's standards -- he hit .280/.332/.346 over the rest of the season, missing two weeks in June and two more in July. 
 
Lewis had predicted the Yankees would win their first pennant in 1920. It turned into a wild three-team race won in the final days of the season, with Cleveland Indians (98-56) finishing ahead of the defending league champion White Sox (96-58) and Yankees (95-59). 
 
Lewis was off by a year; the Yankees would win the pennant in 1921, cruising by 4 1/2 games over the Indians after going 98-55. But alas, Lewis wasn't there to taste the champagne. With Ruth and Meusel anchoring the corners, the Yankees needed a center fielder, and manager Miller Huggins had for three years been trying to acquire one named Braggo Roth. At last the Yankees got him, giving up Lewis and pitcher George Mogridge. Roth, the little brother of Yankees' pitching coach Frank Roth, could hit (a career 124 OPS+) but quickly wore out his welcome wherever he went, playing for six teams in an eight-year career. It happened again with the Yankees, who released him after the season. Roth hit .283/.370/.408 (97 OPS+) but in just 176 plate appearances as he was limited by injuries, and his defense proved inadequate for center. Though just 29 years old, Roth had finally worn out his welcome in the major leagues, with a seventh team unwilling to take a chance on him; he finished his career playing for semi-pro teams and in the minors. 
 
It was Lewis's last year in the majors as well. He played in 27 games with the Senators in 1921, hitting a disappointing .186/.252/.245 before getting released in June. He then returned to the West Coast, playing a few more years in the Pacific Coast League (hitting .392 with Salt Lake City in 1924!) 
 
Mogridge, however, was a big loss for the Yankees. A 32-year-old lefty, Mogridge went 68-55 with a 3.38 ERA (118 ERA+) in five years with Washington before ending his career with the Browns and Braves. After his playing days were over, Mogridge opened a fried chicken joint in Rochester, New York, that was repeatedly cited for serving alcohol during prohibition! 
 
Lewis's post-playing career was more law-abiding but just as colorful. He served as a minor league manager, then as a coach with the Boston Braves. In 1936, he was named the Braves' traveling secretary. [No word if this man was his assistant.](https://y.yarn.co/6012249f-00c4-4cc1-a74a-ad3f988f552e_text.gif) Lewis held the job for 26 years, even after the move to Milwaukee. The man praised by Ruth in 1928 as ""the clothes horse of the league"" continued to live in style, [according to his SABR biography](https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/Duffy-Lewis/): 
 
> His motto was “Pay another buck and travel first class,” and he became renowned around the league with bellhops and waiters as a big tipper, replete with a snap-brim fedora, diamond stickpin, and fancy vests. 
 
In his 70s, Lewis returned to New England, living in New Hampshire with his wife, Eleanor, a woman he first met at a baseball game in 1911. Lewis frequently appeared at Fenway Park -- in 1962, he and other surviving members of the 1912 Red Sox attended a 50th anniversary ceremony of Fenway Park's opening, and in 1975, he threw out the first pitch at Opening Day and the first pitch before Game Six of the World Series. 
 
Lewis died in 1979 at age 91, three years after Eleanor's passing; they had no children. A dapper dresser until the end, the mortician had to select which of his 72 suits to bury him in. The famously big tipper died with little money, and was buried in an unmarked grave. In 2001, baseball fans raised enough money to pay for a beautiful [tombstone](https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2008/215/4809_121781354752.jpg). 
 
**Can't Get Enough... Of That Wonderful Duff** 
 
* ""Duffy's Cliff"" was as famous as the Green Monster in its day for causing havoc for left fielders at Fenway Park. Lewis worked hard to master it. “I’d go out to the ballpark mornings and have somebody hit the ball again and again out to the wall,” Lewis recalled. “I experimented with every angle of approach up the cliff until I learned to play the slope correctly. Sometimes it would be tougher coming back down the slope than going up. With runners on base, you had to come off the cliff throwing.” 
 
* In addition to his speed and savvy, Lewis was known for having a strong throwing arm. He ranks 25th all time in defensive games played as a left fielder, but third all-time in assists as a left fielder, and sixth in double plays turned. 
 
* On [September 6, 1912](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS191209060.shtml), Boston's Smoky Joe Wood had won 13 straight wins. Earlier that season, Washington's Walter Johnson had set the major league record with 16 consecutive wins. As a publicity stunt, the Red Sox started Wood a day earlier than usual so he could face Johnson in what newspaper headlines billed like a championship fight: “The Champion, Walter Johnson, versus the Challenger, Joe Wood.” The game was scoreless until two outs in the the sixth, when Lewis went the other way and hit a looping liner that dropped just in front of right fielder Danny Moeller, scoring Tris Speaker from second. That was the only run of the game, giving Wood his 14th straight win. (He would win his next two starts to tie Johnson's record, then finally lose, 6-4, to the Tigers on September 20.) Lewis later said that hit was one of his proudest moments in baseball. 
 
* On [July 11, 1914](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS191407110.shtml), Babe Ruth made his major league debut, throwing seven innings and getting the win over the Cleveland Naps. Ruth was pulled in the bottom of the seventh for a pinch hitter -- Duffy Lewis! He singled. Lewis often told the story of being one of the few men called upon to pinch hit for Ruth. 
 
* In addition to the Babe, Lewis played with Hall of Famers Tris Speaker, Harry Hooper, Herb Pennock, Home Run Baker, Sam Rice, Walter Johnson, and Bucky Harris, and played for Hall of Fame manager Miller Huggins. 
 
* Despite being members of the ""Golden Outfield,"" Lewis reportedly didn't get along with Speaker, either because Speaker thought Lewis was a braggart, or because Lewis was a Catholic and Speaker was a Protestant... and reportedly also a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1913, Speaker kept knocking off Lewis's cap, and Lewis grabbed a bat and vowed: ""Do that again, and I'll kill you."" Speaker did it again, and Lewis bashed him in the shins with the bat. Speaker had to be helped off the field! ""They used to hate each other,"" an anonymous clubhouse source said. ""Hate each other!"" 
 
* During World War I, Lewis was a player/manager for the base team at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The sailors played against other military squads as well as the Oakland Oaks and other minor league teams. The *Oakland Tribune* in 1918 ran a photo of Lewis and identified him as a Chief Petty Officer, and reported that Lewis's team lost in a five-game championship series to a team of U.S. Marines. 
 
* In 1950, at age 62, Lewis appeared in a minor league game with the Dallas Eagles as a promotional stunt, though it may have been an exhibition game as it [doesn't appear on his minor league record](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=lewis-004geo). 
 
* Lewis was a graduate of Alameda High School, which has produced 12 major leaguers -- including 1950s Yankees third baseman Andy Carey and shortstop Ray French, who got a cup of coffee with the Yankees in 1920 to become Lewis's teammate. Non-Yankees of note are Dick Bartell, a shortstop from 1927 to 1946, and Chris Speier, an infielder in the 1970s and 80s. 
 
* Lewis then played a year at St. Mary's College of California; Carey later attended there too. St. Mary's has produced 70 major leaguers, including Corbin Burnes, Tom Candiotti, and former Yankee prospect Ken Waldichuk. Two of Lewis's Red Sox teammates went to St. Mary's -- Harry Hooper and Dutch Leonard. 
 
* The 1920 pennant race that the Yankees almost won was a wild one. The Yankees had been in first place as late as September 16, but then a four-game losing streak dropped them to third and they never recovered. On September 26, the White Sox were in second place, a half-game behind the Indians and 2 1/2 games ahead of the Yankees, with four games left to play. News of the Black Sox Scandal broke that day as eight players were indicted. The White Sox beat the Tigers, 8-1, with pitcher Eddie Cicotte throwing a complete game to improve to 21-10 on the season. The following day the White Sox won again, 2-0, with Shoeless Joe Jackson delivering a two-run single in the sixth inning. The next day Cicotte confessed to the grand jury that he had participated in a scheme to throw the 1919 World Series. White Sox owner Charlie Comiskey suspended Cicotte, Jackson, Buck Weaver, Happy Felsch, Swede Risberg, Fred McMullin, and Lefty Williams. (The remaining ""Eight Men Out"" was Chick Gandil, who had retired after the World Series.) The depleted White Sox then lost two out of their remaining three games to finish two games behind the Indians and a game ahead of the Yankees. Imagine how crazy it would have been had the White Sox won out and went to the World Series, even as they were accused of throwing it the previous year! 
 
* Babe Ruth was a famously reckless driver, leading to a rumor that he and Lewis had been killed in a car accident. Prior to the game on September 9, some gamblers spread the story, and -- as Ruth had been in a well-publicized car accident just two months earlier, though he wasn't injured -- it spread quickly. (Just for good measure, they also said players Bob Meusel and Del Pratt had been killed.) When the game started, a miracle -- Ruth, Lewis, Meusel, and Pratt all played, but the Yankees lost anyway, 10-4. (Ruth homered and drew three walks; Duffy went 0-for-4 but with two assists.)

> ""There was an odd angle to the Memorial Day games which illustrate what a curious sport baseball really is. In the first encounter, Duffy Lewis smashed a home run into the stands, which tied up the score. There was very little commotion. A minute later, Truck Hannah drove out another homer, which won the game. The excitement was nothing unusual. Then in the second game, Ruth hit his home run when the game was already won, and there is particularly nothing at stake, and the crowd gets so crazy with excitement, they are ready to tear up the stands. Strange, isn't it?"" -- Walter Johnson in *Literary Digest*, September 18, 1920 
 
A star before Ruth, but overshadowed by him on both the Red Sox and the Yankees, Lewis played 11 years and hit .284/.333/.384 (108 OPS+) in 5,351 at-bats, good for 21.1 bWAR. 
 
For a time in the 1950s, there was an effort to get him into the Hall of Fame -- his best showing was in 1955, when he was on 13.5% of the ballots. (Had he been elected, he would likely be remembered as the worst player in the Hall of Fame.) Almost all of that production was with the Red Sox -- with the Yankees, he hit just .272/.304/.352 (78 OPS+) in 924 at-bats, for -0.4 bWAR.

1kccqpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1kccqpm/excerpt_from_how_the_world_works_the_story_of/,Excerpt from How the World Works: The Story of Human Labor from Prehistory to the Modern Day by Paul Cockshott (3 Slave Economy III),"**3.7 MONEY**

Money in the form of coinage arises in societies with markets, and indeed it is arguable that it is a major factor forcing such markets into existence. Developed slave economy presupposes money and monetary exchanges. In this section I will look at the general properties of money that first arose under slavery. These are properties that persist right down to the present.

Purchases with money allow the establishment of a set of consistent market values. Suppose, as in Diocletian’s price edict, an egg sold for 1 denarius, and a measure of wine for 8 denarii, and a measure of olive oul for 40. We can set this out as a Table A (page 73).

Then we can easily see that a measure of wine has the value of 8 eggs.

This is obvious with two commodities and with money, but if you consider a hypothetical barter economy without money then the whole business is much more complicated. You now have a matrix of pairwise swap ratios as in table B (page 73).

Read this as saying, for example, that a measure of olive oil will swap for 40 eggs or for 5 measures of wine.

But consider the complexity that can arise with these three commodities without money prices. Instead of 3 prices, we have 9 exchange ratios. If we had 4 commodities we would have a 4×4 table with 16 ratios. In general the size of your exchange rate table grows as the square of the number of commodities being bartered. **Diocletian set the prices of around 1,000 of them. If, instead of specifying money prices he had fixed a collection of barter rates, the table would have had a million numbers. Given that the Romans had to do all their calculations using the abacus it would have been quite impossible to do the calculations for such a table, let alone distribute copies of it**.

**(A)**

—

Commodity | Denarius Price

—

Eggs 1

Measure of Wine 8

Measure of Oil 40

**(B)**

—

Commodity | Eggs| Measure of Wine | Measure of Oil

—

Eggs 1 | 1/8 | 1/40

Measure of Wine 8 | 1 | 1/5

Measure of Oil 40 | 5 | 1

**(C)**

—

Commodity | Eggs| Measure of Wine | Measure of Oil

—

Eggs 1 | 1/8 | **1/20**

Measure of Wine 8 | 1 | 1/5

Measure of Oil **20** | 5 | 1

**One effect of money is therefore data compression.**

Instead of specifying a million ratios it was enough to give a thousand prices in denarii. **But this compression only works for what I have called consistent swap tables. In a sense this definition is circular, since the consistent swap rate tables are the ones you can create from a single set of money prices. But the logic of private agents engaging in exchanges means that any other sort of swap table is unstable.** Suppose we took table B and changed just one number, the swap ratio between olive oil and eggs to give table C (above) with the changed entries is shown bold.

Suppose I start out with 20 eggs. By the exchange ratio in table C I can get 1 measure of oil. Then, by the last row, I swap that for 5 measures of wine. Then by the middle row, I can swap each of these for 8 eggs each, giving me 5 × 8 = 40 eggs, twice as many as I started with.

A consistent swap table does not let you do this. It is consistent because any circular sequence of barters takes you back to what you initially had. **It does not allow trading for profit. In reality, you never get elaborate systems of barter, the number of exchange ratios that would be needed are simply intractable to manage.** But even supposing you could have such a barter economy, inconsistent swap tables would be unstable. **Consider table C again. Nobody who had olive oil would be willing to swap it directly for only 20 eggs, since they would know that by swapping first for wine and then for eggs they could get 40 eggs. So, subject to a certain amount of random noise, you would only get consistent sets of swap ratios.**

Pairwise barter gives an intractable number of ratios: a thousand goods imply a million swap ratios. They also involve hard calculations, and lots of divisions, which were hard to do in the past.(\*41)

\[\*41 Division is the hardest of the four basic arithmetic operations to do. Even on a modern computer it is much slower than addition. **The paper and pencil division you learned at school relies on algorithms that were not known until the Middle Ages; division in Babylonian times was done using complicated tables of inverses followed by multiplication**. Fast computers still resort to this, for example the RCPSS-Scalar Single-Precision Floating-Point Reciprocal used by Intel computers.\]

Consistent swap ratios are reducible, in information terms, to a single column of numbers as in table A (\*42). Such a column gives us the relative values of the goods. Any society in which exchange occurs is thus enabled by the logic of exchange, and forced by reasons of computational complexity to use something equivalent to a column of prices. The information content in this column, associating a number with each type and unit of a good, is a value system. The units used to express the values are the standard of value. It does not matter if we use one of the goods on the market as the standard of value: cattle, silver, volumes of barley, or instead use a state-issued unit like the denarius. Any of these are capable of acting as the standard of value. We are dealing with an abstract computational imperative that is indifferent to the material used.

\[\*42 In maths we call a table with a single column of numbers a vector. This is slightly confusing if you came across the notion of vectors initially in school physics, where a vector is taken to mean a direction in space. But this meaning you got in school physics is just a special case of the mathematical vector. A direction in three-dimension space—for instance, the direction of an electrostatic field—can be expressed as numbers in an x, y, z coordinate system. The line from the origin to position \[x, y, z\] is the direction we are interested in. So we can encode a direction in space as a column of three numbers. But suppose we have a fifty-dimensional space; how would we describe a direction?\]

You do not need physical coins to have a standard of value. Polanyi et al. \[1957\] argued that in ancient Mesopotamia there was a standard of value, the shekel, which was either a measure of barley or the amount of silver that weighed the same as a barley corn. **The existence of this standard did not imply that transactions were actually carried out by handing over measures of barley to buy things. Instead accounts were kept by scribes on clay tablets, recording physical movements of goods and their equivalent value in shekels. But for this kind of transaction to work you depend on written records and a class of numerate scribes. The Mesopotamian system, which relied on scribes, did not allow illiterate people to engage in distributed transactions as easily as coinage does.**

**Standards of value have not just been used for buying and selling. They were also used in the Sumerian civilization to measure tax liabilities. By expressing these in measures of barley, but allowing tax debts to be settled in different goods: oil, salt, dates etc., barley as the standard of value allowed the state to accept different goods in kind without having to specify exactly which goods each farmer would supply**. Law codes therefore specified the barley equivalent of a wide range of goods \[Postgate, 1992\]. **As I said, the idea of a system-generalized barter is a fantasy for computational reasons, but one could still hypothesize that the logic of consistent exchange along with computational simplicity drove commodity producers to adopt a universal equivalent like the like the Sumerian gur of barley.** But it is not even clear that this arose out of commodity exchange rather than the demands of tax collection (\*44).

\[\*44 On the point that money did not arise from barter exchange, Davies (2010, p. 44) says: “**On one thing the experts on primitive money all agree, and this vital agreement transcends their minor differences. Their common belief back up by the overwhelming tangible evidence of actual types of primitive moneys from all over the world and from the archeological, literary and linguistic evidence of the ancient world, is that barter was not the main factor in the origins and earliest developments of money. The contrast with Jevons, with his predecessors going back to Aristotle, and with his followers, who include the mainstream of conventional economists, is clear-cut**.”\]

What distinguishes circulating money from an abstract measure of value or unit of account is that money is made up of distinct physical objects that can be carried about, counted, and passed from hand to hand. These take two distinct forms:

1. Relatively rare privately produced objects like the cowrie shell, widely used in the urbanized semi-slave economy of West Africa, or the bronze bracelet manillas they used for higher denominations(\*45). This is referred to as “primitive money.”

\[\*45 The cowries persisted in use up until the twentieth century, the British colonial authorities attempted to eliminate them as early as 1880 and official demonetized them in 1904 (Falola and Adebayo, 2000). Attempts to demonetize the manilla were made from 1902, but remained in circulation until at least 1949. The origins of the manilla are unclear but they may date back as far as Phoenician trade with West Africa (Davies, 2010).\]

2. State-issued coins that originated in China and later in the slave economies of the Mediterranean.

The physical properties of the money are important. The money has to be made up of durable discrete units rather than being a continuous quantity. Cowries could serve as money but palm wine cannot. **There is a link between discreteness and calculation. The term “calculation” derives from the Latin for pebble, because calculations were done with pebbles or counters. Coins are a self-recording and self-calculating system. If you have a collection of coins in your purse, they, by their physical presence, act as a record of your claim upon social labor**. You do not have to make a separate symbolic record of it in a ledger or on a computer.

Banking systems of recorded credits have existed since Babylon \[Davies, 2010\] at least. They were widespread in the Roman period \[Banaji, 2016\] and have reached full fruition now. Systems of giro transfer were already well developed in Hellenistic Egypt, with the unit of account in this case being grain rather than coin. But banking requires the permanent recording of transactions and balances. This demands time, resources, and a class of literate and numerate laborers that was, until the modern age, in short supply. These costs meant that while merchants and the wealthy could resort to banks to facilitate transactions, the vast bulk of the population stood outside the banking system until the invention of computerized records,. They might have local debit accounts with individual traders, buying on the slate, but that was all. Credit accounts, or debit accounts of the sort run by Visa, could not extend to the whole population until electronic record keeping became general in the late twentieth century.

In contrast, coins or cowries provide a distributed system of record that requires no more than a simple ability to count. You do not even need to know how to add or subtract. Take the coins out of your purse and hand them over and the relevant sum is automatically deducted from your account. Similarly, the sellers’ accounts are credited as soon as they pocket the coins without them needing to know how to do long addition.

**In addition to these practical advantages, money has to be logically distinguished from banking. This is no longer obvious to us today since so much of modern commodity exchange uses banking operations rather than money. This leads people to identify bank accounts with money. But there is a big logical difference. Money only comes in positive quantities. Bank accounts may hold positive or negative values, credits or debits. Money therefore is a model for the positive whole numbers whereas bank accounts are a model for the signed whole numbers \[Badiou et al., 2007\]. This difference is obscured in modern discourse about the “money supply” and public finance. Arguments that are logically valid when applied to money are no longer valid when applied to bank credit.**

Records that embody social power need to be proof against forgery. **Today we use elaborate electronic ciphers for the most mundane purchase, ciphers that were beyond the ken of the most sophisticated intelligence services in the mid-twentieth century. Other ages have relied on signatures and seals on records or on the matching ends of broken tally sticks** \[Wray, 2004\]. **Whatever the technique, money relies on its units being hard to forge**. Cowrie shells were used as currency far from where the mollusks were found, and as natural products could not be handmade.

Coins have relied on two techniques. **The exact replication of the dies from which they are stamped is hard, so counterfeit coins were visibly different from originals when closely examined. Second, for high-denomination coins, the material from which they are made may itself be expensive: either a pure precious metal or an alloy that has expensive components.** Many European coinage systems for the past 2,600 years worked this way.

In contrast, Chinese money was exclusively base metal for three thousand years until they issued silver coin in 1890. Initially the coins were shaped like cowries or agricultural implements: hoes, knives, etc. \[Davies, 2010\]. By the third century BC the standard form of round coin with a central hole had been arrived at. Western economists, ignoring this long history of base metal money in China, tended to assume that the precious metal content of a currency was essential. The Chinese had to rely on the power of the state rather than the composition of the coins to suppress forgery. Incentives to forge were also diminished by the low value of the individual coins. For larger transactions paper money has been in use in China for over a thousand years. Paper notes obviously have the same discrete self-recording character that cowries and coins had.

Why are coins and, leaping ahead, paper notes able to measure value and record claims on social labor?

The answers given by the classical economists differed somewhat. According to Marx, money had value because the coins were made of gold or silver and the value of a gold coin was simply the value of the gold it contained. Gold required a lot of labor to mine, so a small weight would exchange against many hours spent on other activities. In this view, coins were just state-standardized weights of gold. The state simply steps in to provide convenient portable chunks of the metal. The royal stamp on them was a certificate to say that the gold was pure and the weight accurate.

Ricardo started out from a similar assumption, but then said that the actual prices of goods would be affected not just by the labor required to mine gold, but by the quantity of money circulating in a country \[Ricardo, 1811\]. If there was an outflow of gold to pay for imports, the stock of gold circulating as coin would be curtailed. With less money being available to purchase commodities, there would be a general fall in prices. Lower prices of that nation’s goods would then promote exports, while at the same time the shortage of bullion would hamper imports. In the end the imbalance in trade would be compensated for by price shifts brought about by the change in the quantity of money. This was the initial form of the famous quantity theory of monetary value.

Marx disputed this mechanism. He held that only a small portion of the bullion in a country was at any time actually in circulation. A larger part was held as hoards so that these would buffer the effect of changes in quantity. An increase in the gold stock in a nation would simply cause more bullion to be hoarded as reserves in private strongboxes or banks.

These views reflect the range of debate taking place in early nineteenth-century Europe, and are posed in the context of a specifically European history of gold and silver coinage. But the perspective fails to generalie to the long history of money in China or to the monetary systems that exist in the contemporary world, neither of which rely on gold or silver. Ricardo’s concern with bullion outflows actually related to a persistent feature of the trade between Europe and China. **While Europe had, since the opening up of sea routes to the East, craved high-quality Chinese manufactures, it had little of equivalent quality that it was able to export in return. The West had to resort to exporting bullion to purchase its imports from China. A large part of the silver from European colonies in the New World went across the Pacific to pay for imports of tea, ceramics, silks, and the like from China. Ricardo’s purported equilibrating mechanism was ineffective given the poor quality, as seen from the Chinese perspective, of European exports. A fall in the price of substandard European potteries would not induce the Chinese to buy from these rather than their own fine porcelain manufacturers. The recourse of the East India Company was instead to go into the drug trade and export addictive opium to China via their Hong Kong trading post.** Once in China, of course, the bullion did not have the inflationary effect predicted by Ricardo because the currency was not bullion based; it vanished into hoards as predicted by Marx’s monetary theory.

**However, neither Ricardo’s nor Marx’s theory adequately explained the Chinese situation. Since China’s money was either paper or copper why did it have any value at all?**

If we look at the historical origin of coinage in the West, the earliest coins were issued by Lydia, home of the legendary King Midas, at the start of the seventh century BC \[Bolin, 1958\]. These certainly seemed to fit in with the idea that they were state-standardized weights of precious metal. They were shaped like coffee beans and had an emblem of a lion on one side. They were made to an accurate standard weight. Within a short period of less than a century these evolved into round coins.

The classical account of the origin of coins fall down on one crucial detail. The Lydian coins were not made of gold but of electrum, a gold-silver alloy that naturally occurs in the area. This means that people accepting the coins as standard weight in gold have been deceived. Not only that, but the gold content of these coins was lower than in naturally occurring electrum, indicating that the kingdom of Lydia was adding silver to the mix before stamping the coins \[Cowell and Hyne, 2000\]. Bolin \[1958\] points out that from the earliest days the issue of coins could be a profitable activity. He recounts that during the roman Empire there was a process of reducing the precious metal content of the currency, with the denarius moving from a silver coin to a predominantly copper coin with a thin silver coat for appearance’s sake. The process is mirrored in more recent monetary history with the English penny moving from a silver coin, up to the eighteenth century, and then switching to copper, then to bronze, and shrinking as it did so. The contemporary penny is not even solid copper; it has an iron core coated with copper. This reinforces the Chinese experience that commercial activity can be carried out for prolonged periods with token currencies—much of the third century in the Roman case, since 1947 in the British case.

Coins found in hoards are one of the most common relics of past ages, and there has been a temptation on the part of some49 to equate periods of fine silver and gold coins with particularly well-developed commodity production. Were this a safe assumption, then London must have been more prosperous and commercial under George I than under George VI in whose reign the coinage became entirely base metal.(\*50)

\[\*50 The question of whether a coinage is made up of low intrinsic value tokens of fine gold coins may be better understood from the standpoint of class struggle. **Creditor classes, whether the late Roman aristocracy studied by Banaji, or U.S. bankers in the late nineteenth century, are likely to favor gold coins as the only acceptable means of settling debts. This protects the real value of their debts in terms of labor. Debtors, whether indebted states in the modern period or indebted farmers throughout history, will favor a more readily available currency: silver or debased coins, or state paper.** These make the paying off of debt easier, and if they depreciate, reduce the real value of debt obligations.\]

An alternative theory of money, whose recent exponents include Wray \[2004\] and Ingham \[2004\], attributes its value to the ability of the state to impose obligations like taxes and fines on its subjects. **The state lays claim to part of the social surplus product. If the state specifies that the tax obligation is to be met in labor or grain, then money does not arise. But if it is willing to accept coins of its own issue, then these acquire value. They do this not because of labor that went into the coin, but because the coins stand in for the labor that would otherwise have been directly performed. So long as there is within an area a unified state with effective tax or tribute-raising powers, and it is willing to accept its own coin in settlement of tax debts, then these coins will have an effective circulation**. This theory explains:

1. Why there is usually a distinct monetary or coinage system for each state.

2. Why societies have been able to operate for long periods with purely token monies.

3. Why the issue of money is not only a source of revenue for the state but has been protected by ferocious penalties.

4. Why and how states can change the monetary system. For example, British colonial authorities demonetized the cowrie by specifying that tax debts now had to be met in British-issued coin \[Forstater, 2003\].

**Prior to the invention of coins or paper money the state’s appropriation of surplus labor was in the form of labor obligations or it was specified in the physical form of grain or crops. We call this the real appropriation of the surplus product. Monetary taxes are, in contrast, a merely formal or symbolic appropriation of wealth.**

**But the state needs to appropriate a real surplus. It needs actual labor to build roads, actual food for its soldiers, real iron for its weapons. Such real wealth is purchased with coin.**

**Coin divorces real from formal appropriation. The two become separate in time, space, and person. They can be separate in time because the state can purchase resources, appropriating the real surplus, prior to money taxes being paid.** Indeed, unless the state has issued the coins by buying things, there is no money available to pay taxes. It is separated in space since taxes raised in one part of the state can be used to purchase labor and resources in another part. This frees a regional state administration in an empire from a dependence on purely local resources. **Finally, the invention of coinage allowed the separation of the taxpayer from the physical surplus provider. Taxes levied on peasants can pay the wages of a professional standing army without the peasants themselves having to serve. Without the ability to pay a mercenary professional army, the conquests of an Alexander or Trajan would have been impossible** \[Davies, 2010\].

**For all this to happen, society had to reorganize itself on mercantile lines. The peasants, to pay their taxes in money, must produce cash crops. Merchants, sea captains and crew must link the provinces where taxes are raised to the metropolis where they were spent, and whose population partly depended on the imperial expenditure.**

**Whether in the Macedonian, Roman, or British empires, imperial coins and imperial taxes transformed self-sufficient communities into commodity producers** \[Forstater, 2003\]. **Monetization transformed limited domestic slavery into the ruthless exploitation of the latifundia, boosting the surplus that supported an urban ruling class. Cash linked state and aristocracy, via a chain of commodity production and handling to free or enslaved primary producers. From the moment the state issued money and compelled its return in tax, people saw the world in its silver mirror, and in a mirror everything is reversed. Forced to give unto Caesar that which was Caesar’s, the very instrument of their subjection, coin, came to appear as the truest of true wealth.** Their actually useful crops and artifacts now appeared as mere instruments to acquire money, which alone now counted as real value. In the epoch of the transition to what Aristotle called chrematistics, or the striving for money, its absurdity could still be seen by poets or philosophers. The parable of Midas, king from the land where coins were invented, demystified the image in money’s mirror, but heedless of fable or moralist, humanity were yet forced to live the illusion.

\[\*51 The fable of Midas or the economic theory of Aristotle Meikle (1997) address the contradiction between exchange value and use value. This is to point out a confusion at a relatively mundane level of thought. There is a deeper confusion present in commercial language which speaks of value being “realized” when a commodity is sold as money. But this metaphor is even more naive and, in Marx’s terms, fetishistic” than the desires of Midas. When a state operates a system of token money, either base metal coins of paper notes, then the sale of a commodity is better seen as the idealization value. A commodity embodying real labor, and thus the real substance of exchange value, is exchanged for a mere sheet of paper bearing the symbol or idea of value. The real value has passed into the hands of the purchaser, the seller is left with state paper. If Joe in the United States sells a TV for $100 he can at least settle his U.S. tax debts with it. If TCL Corporation of Guandong sells 10,000 TV sets for $1 million, they are left with a U.S. credit that may in the long term be unrealizable in terms of anything of either use value or labor value.\]",1,1746116268.0,u_MirkWorks,0,1.0,False
