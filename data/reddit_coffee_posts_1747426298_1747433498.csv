1kodab8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kodab8/he_warned_me_about_camera_6/,He Warned Me About Camera 6,"I needed money. Bad. Rent was late my fridge was empty and my credit cards were maxed, so when I saw a job listing that said “Night Security. No Experience Necessary. $30/hr. Must Be Okay With Isolation” I didn’t hesitate I replied instantly.

The interview was strange. Conducted over Zoom by a man with a voice like gravel and zero expression. He didn’t ask much. Just told me I’d be monitoring security cameras from a trailer outside an old hospital about 20 minutes outside of town. The place had been shut down for nearly a decade but apparently the owners wanted to “keep an eye on things”

“Just sit in the trailer. Watch the feeds. Don’t go inside. Ever.” he said
Simple enough

My first shift started last Friday. The trailer was a rusty little box just outside the main building. Inside it smelled like mold and old coffee and the only light came from the hum of six monitors stacked in two rows of three. Each screen showed a black and white feed from inside the hospital. Hallways. Storage rooms. Stairs. One was trained on the morgue

That was Camera 6

The guy who trained me if you can even call it that said one thing before leaving
“Don’t stare too long at Camera 6. If it flickers just… look away.”

I thought he was messing with me Trying to spook the new guy

But around 3:17 AM Camera 6 flickered.

Just a quick static buzz nothing major. But it caught my attention. The feed showed the morgue... long steel tables those creepy freezer drawers and overhead lights that hadn’t worked in years. Only now there was a light on. Flickering

I leaned closer

Something was moving. Slow. From behind one of the freezer doors

A hand

Thin. Skeletal. As if the skin had been pulled too tight. The fingers curled against the steel table dragging something, someone, out

The monitor buzzed again this time louder. The camera cut to static then came back

Now the thing was standing. It was tall. Unnaturally tall with long arms that stretched too far down its sides. It had no eyes. No face at all. Just pale wrinkled flesh smooth and featureless like wax

I looked away I had to

But then came the knock

Not from the door of the trailer from behind me

I turned slowly. Nothing

But when I looked back at the monitor the figure on Camera 6 was gone

Gone from the morgue. But now it was on Camera 2. The hallway. Closer to the exit

Every five minutes it appeared on the next closest feed. Room by room. Step by step

By 3:55 it was on Camera 1 just outside the trailer. I killed the monitors. I didn’t want to see it anymore. I sat in the dark heart pounding holding a flashlight like it was a weapon

I don’t remember falling asleep. Just waking up sunlight bleeding through the tiny window. The screens were off. Everything looked normal again

But the tape from last night? It was gone. Erased

I called my contact to quit. He just said “Understood. We'll find someone else.”

Before I hung up I had to ask
“What happens if someone actually lets it in?”

He paused

I want them to change it, spice it up—like, let’s take an angel instead.

Plot idea:

You woke up and it’s 3:00 AM. After going to the kitchen for a glass of water/coffee, you climb up the stairs and return back to sleep after a piss.

You enter your sheets, snuggle up, and notice that your cover sheets/duvet is snagging at a corner.

You try dragging it again, but it doesn’t move—then you look to adjust it, switching on the bedside lamp that’s hardly on (as you live alone). And when switched on, you see an androgynous-looking person with an indescribable face that you take as similar to a mix of your father/mother/siblings’ faces layered over one another.

You squeeze your eyes and look again, wondering in confusion—but this time, the face is covered with wings over itself. That’s when you jump out of your bed in horror.

You try to escape, but the door doesn’t open—neither the exit nor the bathroom door.

You try kicking and struggling, but the figure gradually moves over to you, and in their hand they hold a book. They pronounce to you:

> “In three earth cycles on the eve of the last full moon you shall die.”

> “It cannot be changed or altered unless you redeem yourself.”

> “Be it as it must.”

And without further context, they just open the door and leave. Your heart thumps. In the morning, you hurry to the nearest cathedral.

You ask the priest, who then looks at you like a fool who overdrank last night—they do try to help your situation, but you can’t describe what you saw. Only those three sentences ring in your mind.

They offer you to take a rest and come back, but hesitation to not die keeps ringing in your sweaty, heart-pounding face.

⸻

Something like this, where you must try to find out what is needed.

Your heart thumps. You get a proposal that your crimes and sins might have caught up to you—or that what you did sometime ago is catching up.

Then, during this period, the MC goes on a remedial journey, trying to track back everything they did throughout their life, confessing and apologizing for everything they ever did… only for them to die at the end.

I am not a good plot maker and don’t know if it’s good, but I just want a new flavour of horror.

Please judge for yourselves. Disregard typos and punctuation. Don't yell at me.

Spike- good. Kind EMT/firefighter.  
Vega- Bold. Funny. Lesbian.   
Rocky- didnt get bullied enough as a kid. Possible neckbeard. Well-meaning. I think.   
Angel- Just all around a cool person  
me- baby emt



Whenever I think I may be safely tucked away from the nefarious vibes of a neckbeard, I am eventually proven wrong. They are everywhere.



I work EMS... In the boonies. I am a professional taker-of-vitals, a wizard of pacifying patients. I have been in this trade for the long stretch of four months. I am a tradesman of applying band-aids and keeping psych patients from doing cartwheels out of the ambulance. While mostly alright there are still the occasional notes of racism, offensive sexism, and other things I personally find objectionable in the workplace. Those of you who often work in male-dominated trades or fields should be very familiar with this.

Coming back to the station for the first time after being on shift ten hours my partner Spike and I go to the closet-sized break room to sort paperwork, eat, and catch up with whoever is around. I set to nibbling the ugly tye-dye mess of yogurt and mini m&m's I thought was a good idea to pack last night. It still tasted good despite looking like wet vomit. With us are Vega, a short and loud lesbian queen who is always into some sort of tomfoolery, Rocky- the suspected neckbeard, and maybe one or two others I didn't notice.

Spike is a doll. He's mid 20s, only child of divorced immigrant parents who work very hard, and his main job is at the fire station. He works PRN or as needed as an EMT. Spike is kind, generous to a fault, sincere, helpful, and always has a smile on his face. He's the kind of guy to buy you a $10 coffee if you're having a bad day even if his bank account is sitting at $20.00. With all the guys around there's an unavoidable boys-club of grab-assing and horseplay which can be fun to be around sometimes. It was not fun this time.

Eating on my sugar-slop Rocky and Vega enter the room. Vega is squinting and her face is a bit red, they are both laughing. They explained that Vega sprayed Rocky with something, and in retaliation, he grabbed the hand sanitizer, pumping it on her head. As liquids tend to do when subjected to gravity, the sanitizer dripped down her forehead and a bit got into her eye. Ouch! But Vega is badass and this is an ongoing thing between the two of them; they're always doing this shit with each other so it's mutual. Have at it, kids.

Making small talk, everything is normal until Spike unsuspectingly walks into the small room which is now halfway to crowded. Squeezing past Rocky \[not an easy feat\] Spike makes for the open seat to my right- but doesn't make it there unmolested. I guess both of them having worked at the same fire station gives them a license to ... I don't know, *harass each other to an uncomfortable degree*. So quicker than anyone can notice Rocky lifts his hand back, and SWINGS with enough force that when he smacks Spike's ass, Spike jumps into the air like a scared cat. Maybe 1-1.5"" but this is a grown ass man we're talking about.

Personally, my eyes are on Spike. Do I need to say something? Do I need to step in? His expression is one of shock and surprise, but negative surprise. Embarrassment. Though feigning normalcy his eyes are on the ground and he covers his buttocks to slink in shame the remaining two feet to the chair. There is laughter. Mostly from Rocky and Vega.

I do not laugh. It is not funny.

I have just witnessed blatant sexual harassment in the workplace. So help me god, if someone did that to me even if it was my BEST FRIEND, I would be angry. But Spike says nothing and takes his seat, likely processing how to take the situation. He's a go-along-to-get-along sort who just wants to be accepted and not make waves. After a few more seconds he slowly picks back up his easygoing demeanor. I think about texting him if he's okay and wants me to step in and 'be the adult'. Maybe I should have anyway. I get the feeling he wants to play it off so I do nothing. (I am not proud of that, and if it happens again I will step in. Having experienced harassment myself physical situations make me freeze sometimes.)

Unhappily I eat my yogurt in silence as they start talking shit to each other. Rocky discusses several subjects- What do you tell/call a woman with two black eyes?

""Wow, I heard that joke in middle school."" I interject rudely, trying to imply that it's crass and low-effort. If you're going to joke about DV at least make it funny. When discussing the topic later with my husband he replies, 'a firefighter's wife?' as a slight to Rocky and I laugh. The answer to the joke is usually 'nothing, you already told her twice!'. A coworker, Angel, walks in around this time to get something. Without much memory of the exact topic except something about nipples was said, Angel's face is one of unimpressed discomfort. She's the shining star on the Christmas tree of our station.

Seeing the judgmental look on Angel's face, Rocky gestures to me.

""Come on, she doesn't care."" \[Rocky cannot observe my face from where I am sitting.\]

""Actually, I think she does."" Angel says in her dissapointed-mom voice. Us two ignore them and talk about something unrelated for a moment. Angel departs. I am still eating my throw-up yogurt.

Rocky then asks Spike if he'll go to the club with him. Spike is a little shy but plays along. But I don't think Rocky is joking. He's a large sort- which I don't care about. But there does come a point where I believe it affects your ability to move around in the back of an ambulance and do things like CPR. But that is my unsolicited opinion. Rocky goes on to mention two girls by their stage name, and the names are just specific and unusual enough it leads me to think he actually went. Think Amethyst instead of the more common Diamond or Crystal. I have nothing kind to say, so I just listen.

""I think i'll go this weekend. \[worker name\] was really nice to me,""

Yes. Their entire job is fooling sad and obnoxious men into thinking their company is tolerable. That's how they get the bag- and power to them. He mentions not buying his first lap dance and slips up saying he usually just loiters around until whoever he goes with buys one for him.

In my one and only shift with Rocky he was going into detail about how he always paid his rent a month behind because he didn't have any money. And his one bedroom loft was just SO COOL in this small town- even though it was about the same as the price for my husband and I's 2 bed 2 bath with basement in the next largest city. Also he supposedly got a rent discount for being a firefighter or something. So he's really good with money. But he was very kind to me that shift and patient with my dumbassery.

He shows pictures of the newest gun he purchased, which sounds fancy and expensive, and then brags about how often he likes to speed in whatever car he drives and that it's only bad if the cops actually catch you.

""Aren't you like... *a firefighter?*"" I ask skeptically, surprised that he'd speak with such a blatant disregard for the law. Firefighters, first responders, and cops are unofficially affiliated in my mind. It's like a cop bragging about shoplifting. And it's different than the ""Wow, haha! I did \[*illegal drug*\] before my shift today! Aren't I so silly!"" jokes.

""Yeah. So?""

I am silent. Flabberghasted that he isn't picking up what i'm putting down. He then doubles down on \[what I hope is\] the charade quoting exact speeds, roads, and how many times he's gotten away. He's the kid in middle school whose parents don't pay attention to him so he lies and one-ups everyone. Everybody claps.

There's the exchange of racial jokes. Except it isn't an exchange at all- it's just Rocky picking on Spike and Spike kind of feeding into it. I begin to get the impression that this racially-based harassment is such a regular part of his career that he gave up even the thought of fighting it long ago. Or maybe it genuinely doesn't bother him! Idk.

But it's not even clever stuff. There's no thought put into it. There's no effort. It's shit like- *'he's the temu special!' 'the factory wouldn't take him back!' 'something something rice paddies!'* Eventually Spike and I meander into the TV room. I am grateful Rocky is gone. But wait- sensing that his presence is possibly missed, Rocky- who GOT OFF SHIFT 30 MINUTES AGO- is just ... hanging around. Not really even involved in a deep conversation with anyone. Just... looking for reasons to be social. Which, okay- have at it. But also, weird.

He comes up and gives Spike a fist bump- Spike who is reclined in an arm chair leans forward and hugs Rocky around the waist. ""I love you bro""s are exchanged. And then the racist jokes return. Possibly noting my and another girl's unflinching (and judgmental) gaze, Rocky tries to back pedal.

""He likes it!

He's used to it!""

He think's its funny!""

Spike acquiesces. So I don't say anything and let them say their goodbyes. Rocky talks more about speeding and I interject with, 'that's messed up.' Sensing the oppurtunity to speak with a (REEEEEEE) *FEMOID*, he lingers in the doorway to the room again going on about how it's only bad if he's caught, how is it messed up that he breaks the law, etc etc etc. He does not seem to grip that I do not think it is cool. Eventually it tapers off into short pleasantries on my end and Rocky departs.

I let a few minutes pass with the TV in the background before I cautiously breach the subject.

Spike.... Are you familiar with Stockholm syndrome?""

""Y-yeah. Why do you ask?""

""Because I feel like I just high-key watched you get bullied for thirty minutes.""

The rest of the conversation isn't really important- myself and the other woman in the room explain how and why we though it wasn't horseplay but bullying. How jokes constantly at the expense of others bring you down instead of lifting you up. That maybe- he deserves to be treated with more respect than that. Spike is uncomfortable and swears up and down that it's normal, he's ok with it, he wasn't offended, and it's fine.

So I mind my business... But I be plottin'. Admittedly the plotting is just going to be me drawing uncomfortable attention to the physical bullying the next time I see it until Rocky is shamed into submission. But hey, small wins right?

I (29F) have a coworker (25M) who works very closely with me. He is a nice enough person, and treats me very nicely, but he really does bother me and make me occasionally uncomfortable.
The way I view this guy is like an annoying little brother, who you enjoy sometime with but most of the time they get on your nerves. We are just very different people, especially when it comes to our job (we are Manuel screen printers). He is very messy and fast moving, making mistakes often on the clothes we decorate and just making an absolute mess with ink and equipment, always moving shared tools around like they are exclusively his, blah blah. I on the other hand I take my time, print very neatly, cleanup a job immediately, make little to no mistakes, and always end up “fixing” jobs that he messed up on.
Aside from these little aggravating things about our actual job, he has this thing about buying me coffees or breakfast in the mornings even though I always tell him I always make it at home or stop on my way in to work. He also asks me if I want something for lunch too, even though I always pack my own lunch and ALWAYS tell him this. It makes me extremely uncomfortable when people spend money on me because I don’t have the funds to do it back. It also makes me uncomfortable to accept this from another man because I am in a serious relationship, we live together and I am 6 months pregnant with our first child, I just only want my own man doing this sort of thing for me. It wouldn’t be as weird if he got others at work coffee and such too but it’s literally just me.
He does have his own girlfriend and child with her. He comes to me often for advice with their relationship, which I don’t mind most of the time but sometimes it’s way too personal, for example he recently told me “because I’m not so small, it hurts my gf to have sex because of her iud”. That was absolutely crazy to me, I responded with I mean I’m pretty sure discomfit is common with that sort of thing and to have HER consult with her doc. Like come on that is friggen wild to ask your coworker about. I quickly gave that answer and walked away from our area for a very long time.
I’ve only known this person for 4 months. I started working at this place while he was out on medical leave. He had a near death experience a week after his own mother died. The kids been through a lot, is a recovering alcoholic and I suspect abused other things as well but hasn’t came out and said that. I think because he sees I’m a kind and empathetic person he has over shared and trauma dumped on me just after a few weeks of knowing me, and now classifies me as his best friend. 
I feel like a bitch, I know my friendship means a lot to him because he excessively tells me this, I just DO NOT feel this way about him. I just don’t know what to do. We work right next to each other every single day, and I find myself hoping he doesn’t show up to work. It’s to the point that I question how his gf would feel about all of this, but he has told me “gf says it’s my job to take care of the pregnant lady”. This makes me so so uncomfortable because NO it is not, you are not the father of my child, husband, boyfriend, close friend, or family. I feel he has a crush on me and this is how he deals with it. I just am looking for any advice in moving forward with this situation. I love my job, it’s the happiest I’ve been working in an establishment EVER! It’s related to my college education, around the corner from my home, and from my already existing daughters school. Everything about it is perfect except for this guy. Please help. 
Ps: no I have not talked to my boss about this because I really don’t won’t him to get in trouble or worst case even loose his job over this. I’d rather try and deal with this myself like a big girl.",1,1747432948.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1kod4uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1kod4uz/how_do_you_make_catholic_friends/,How do you make Catholic friends?,"TLDR: 28 year old guy, almost nobody else my age at my parish. No young adults groups or ministries at my parish, no efforts to build a community at the parish or to have others get to know each other. Would like to make some Catholic friends, people with a shared faith and beliefs, can't find any Catholic young adult groups or anything around me, what do? Based in SoCal suburban area. 

Hey everyone, 

I've been wanting to and trying to get more involved in my parish and meet more Catholics around my age, I'm a 28 year old guy, but it's been slow to non-existent progress. I think part of the issue is I'm already an introvert and my parish is mostly either young families and older people. The whole area I live in, my hometown, isn't exactly a college town or a place people my age move to, rather out of. My parish doesn't have a young adults group or ministry, no coffee and donuts after Mass or anything, the closest would be a couple small evangelical and charismatic ministries.

I got commissioned as a Eucharist minister a few months back, it's been great, humbling, amazing that Christ chose someone like me to save from the shackles and darkness of where I've come from and then to be able to minister to Him in the Eucharist. I'm the youngest Eucharist minister though, by like 20 years, and we don't do anything like a group prayer before Mass or anything.

I honestly feel like an alien at times, it's like everyone else my age here has either sadly left the faith, away doing something important somewhere big, or is married, started a family, and rightfully busy with their own lives. Then there's me, just keeping my head down, trying my best to keep growing closer to God and follow Christ, haven't really gotten into dating intentionally as all I've known before is the secular world and people, not much going on. The way I see it is God is keeping my life slow right now to give me a chance to grow closer to Him, so that I may grow personally and spiritually, and that's what I've been trying to do. People keep saying I should become a priest, joking that God has kept me unmarried for a reason, I did consider it a while ago, but idk, I eventually want to marry and start a family honestly.

Anyways, I can make friends at work and stuff fine, but I really would like to surround myself more with others who are on a similar spiritual path with the same Catholic faith. It's sad because there's always a lot of protestant groups and Bible studies, but almost nothing Catholic like that I see. What are some ways you get to know and make Catholic friends? Places I should go, sites where events are organized, etc.?

Thanks a lot!

Just pure *optimism in a bottle*. The kind of scent that makes you want to twirl in your kitchen or send flirty texts for no reason.

It made me feel… **pretty. And present.**

  


# The Heart – Delicate but Powerful

After the fruity opening, **rose and peony** softly take over. Not a bombastic bouquet, more like petals brushing your skin. It feels like wearing something silky and floral—*effortless elegance*.

[Blanche](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-blanche-french-collection-spray-100ml?variant=43644630925369) isn’t trying to impress a room. It’s for **you**, not for others. And sometimes, that’s even better.

Throughout the day, little whiffs from my wrists or clothes just... reminded me of *me*. And honestly? That quiet boost of confidence hit different.

# Everyday Elegance

Before Blanche, I was a “perfume only on special occasions” kind of girl. This one changed the game. I started wearing it to do groceries, to sip coffee at my desk, or just around the house in my robe. Because why not feel polished and pretty doing the mundane?

It made **everyday life feel just a little bit more magical**.

  


# Scented Memories

Brunches. Cozy nights in. That one sunny Sunday in the park. [Blanche](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-blanche-french-collection-spray-100ml?variant=43644630925369) was there for all of it. Now when I smell it, I’m instantly transported to those sweet, ordinary-but-special moments. That’s what makes it so personal. It’s not just a perfume. It’s part of my story now.

  


# My Final Thoughts

If you’re craving a scent that isn’t about being sexy or powerful or bold—but about feeling **soft, feminine, and beautiful just as you are**—then *please* give **Blanche** a try.

It’s my signature now. Not because it shouts—but because it whispers all the right things.

Remote work keeps growing every year, with more people valuing the freedom to set their own schedules. While ditching the commute and staying in your pajamas sound great, working from home comes with trade-offs. The costs aren’t limited to buying a new desk or chair — many expenses fly under the radar.

https://preview.redd.it/04dyi091v71f1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=98db334264b520ddc47332003e9ed50d819c67a5

That’s why knowing about home office deductions, how to calculate home office deduction, and what the IRS rules for home office deduction really mean matters if you want to see real savings. Taking the right steps can put more money back in your pocket, but missing key details can leave you paying more than you should. Whether you’re self-employed or freelancing on the side, understanding the fine print is key to making remote work truly work for you.

# Unpacking the Financial Costs of Working from Home

Switching to remote work means your home becomes your office, and that brings costs — both expected and unexpected. It’s more than just buying a laptop. Think about your equipment, utilities, repairs, and the perks you leave behind at a traditional workplace. Here’s a closer look at the direct, ongoing, and hidden financial impacts of working from home.

# Initial Setup: Equipment and Technology Needs

Setting up your home office usually starts with a shopping list. Even if you already own a computer, you’ll notice gaps if you want a productive and comfortable workspace. Here are the typical investments most remote workers make:

* **Computer, Monitor, and Printer:** A reliable laptop or desktop can run from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, especially if you handle design, video, or code. Many also need a quality monitor or a pair for multitasking and a printer for contracts or forms.
* **Office Furniture:** That kitchen chair will get old fast. Ergonomic chairs and desks do wonders for your back and focus, but these upgrades come with a price tag. Desks, chairs, proper lighting, and perhaps a monitor arm add up.
* **Ergonomic Tools:** Think wrist supports, adjustable chairs, footrests, and keyboard trays. These help prevent strain and fatigue. For ideas on what makes a real difference, [7 Must-Have Ergonomic Upgrades for Your Home Office](https://www.cnet.com/health/ergonomic-office-equipment/) lists strong options.
* **Internet and Network Upgrades:** Many home networks aren’t ready for daily Zoom calls, large downloads, or cloud syncs. Upgrading to faster speeds or business-class internet often means higher monthly bills, installation fees, and maybe upgraded hardware like routers or mesh networks. Security is a growing worry too, and investing in decent firewalls, VPNs, or encrypted drives matters if you handle sensitive data.
* **Power Backup and Accessories:** Battery backups (UPS), surge protectors, and decent webcams or microphones now feel essential.

Some of these costs, like the computer or printer, may be deductible if you qualify for home office deductions. These upfront expenses could pay for themselves if your setup improves your bottom line. See [13 Home Office Upgrades You Need If You Work Remotely](https://www.todoist.com/inspiration/home-office-upgrades) for more ideas and practical solutions that won’t break the bank.

# Ongoing Costs: Utilities, Maintenance, and Supplies

Getting your setup right is just the start. There are steady expenses that keep popping up once you work from home.

* **Rising Utility Bills:** With computers, monitors, lights, and HVAC systems running all day, expect your power and heating bills to go up. The simple act of making coffee, charging devices, and running an extra fridge for snacks adds noticeable dollars each month.
* **Water and Cleaning:** Bathroom breaks, extra hand washing, more dishes — it adds up. You’ll use more water and find yourself cleaning up spills or vacuuming more often.
* **Supplies and Upkeep:** Paper, ink, pens, sticky notes, and folders no longer show up magically in the supply closet. Repairs to office equipment or your work chair are now your problem, not IT’s.
* **Wear-and-Tear:** Walking the halls at work used to stress commercial flooring. Now your own carpets, rugs, and home equipment show extra wear. Little fixes and basic home maintenance can sneak up on you.
* **Insurance adjustments:** If you run a business from home or have valuable tech, you may need to boost your homeowners or renters insurance for coverage.

Many of these ongoing costs can be tracked and may be partially deductible. The IRS allows you to write off certain portions as business expenses. You can check [Publication 587 (2024), Business Use of Your Home](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p587) or this detailed guide on [expenses related to your home office that are deductible](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/expenses-related-to-your-home-office-are-deductible).

# Indirect Financial Impacts: Loss of Office Perks and Professional Expenses

With no breakroom or shared printer, you lose the little conveniences that used to be free. The cost savings of working remotely can be offset by some unexpected trade-offs:

* **Goodbye to Employer-Paid Perks:** Office coffee, snacks, catered lunches, unlimited printing, and the occasional lunch out all disappear. Now, you pick up the tab for what used to be complimentary.
* **Higher Insurance or Repair Bills:** Any repairs to your dedicated workspace — think plumbing, electrical, even faster internet installations — are yours alone to fund.
* **Professional Memberships or Software:** If your company used to pay for subscriptions or memberships, you might need to start footing the bill.
* **Space Costs:** Dedicating a room or corner to work means less space for living — or maybe paying for more square footage.

Some remote employees or the self-employed can factor these into their tax planning, making use of home office deduction calculators to see what their write-off might look like. Understanding [the hidden costs and savings of remote work](https://clarifycapital.com/hidden-costs-of-remote-work) can help you see the bigger picture and avoid surprises at tax time.

We rarely sit down and total what we lose in workplace benefits. As you add up the real expenses — both the ones on your credit card bill and those lost perks — remote work shows its full price tag. Knowing these numbers makes it easier to choose the right tax strategies, maximize your home office deduction, and get the most out of working from home.

# The True Value of Home Office Deductions

Understanding how home office deductions can affect your bottom line is more than just a tax-season chore — it’s a financial opportunity. Get it right, and you may keep hundreds, sometimes thousands, in your own pocket every year. But these deductions are full of details. Learning who qualifies, which expenses count, and how to avoid common errors is key to maximizing your savings. Let’s break down the must-know rules and smart moves for getting the most out of your work-from-home setup.

# What Are the IRS Rules for Home Office Deduction?

The IRS doesn’t allow just anyone to write off a laptop in the living room. There are strict guidelines about who can claim home office deductions and what space counts as an office.

Photo by [Mikhail Nilov](https://www.pexels.com/@mikhail-nilov)

Here are the core eligibility requirements:

* **Exclusive Use:** Your home office must be a space used only for work, not a guest room or occasional playroom.
* **Regular Use:** The space must be a primary spot where you conduct business regularly.
* **Principal Place of Business:** If you use multiple locations, your home office must be where you do most of your work or meet clients.
* **Self-Employed or Qualified Employee:** Most W-2 employees cannot claim this deduction, but freelancers, small business owners, and independent contractors often can.

Some exceptions exist, but not many. Shared spaces or temporary home-work setups likely don’t qualify. The IRS offers detailed breakdowns in their [Office in the Home FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-regs/office_in_the_home_faq%26av1.pdf) and [Topic №509, Business Use of Home](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc509) for those who want the nitty-gritty. These resources are a smart starting point to make sure your setup fits the rules.

# How to Calculate Home Office Deduction

There are two main ways to figure out your savings: the simplified method and the regular method. Each works a bit differently, and understanding both helps you choose the one that puts more money back in your wallet.

# Simplified Method

* **$5 per Square Foot:** Multiply up to 300 square feet of qualifying office space by $5 per square foot.
* **No Receipts Needed:** You don’t need to track every expense. Just know your office’s size and you’re set.
* **Quick and Easy:** This route is fastest for most people, especially solo business owners or side-hustlers with small workspaces.

You can read more on the [IRS’s page about the Simplified Option](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/simplified-option-for-home-office-deduction).

# Regular Method

* **Pro-Rated Expenses:** Figure the percentage of your home used exclusively for business, then apply this to actual expenses like mortgage interest, rent, utilities, insurance, repairs, and depreciation.
* **More Paperwork:** Requires careful recordkeeping. You’ll need details about every eligible expense.
* **Usually Best for Larger Offices:** If your work area is big or your home costs are high, this method may mean a bigger deduction.

If you’re trying to decide which method fits you, consider testing both with a [home office deduction calculator](https://protaxteam.com/resources/home-office-deduction-calculator-2/). These tools ask for your total home size, office space, and expenses, then show both the simplified and regular amount side by side.

Common expenses that can be included (when using the regular method) are:

* Mortgage interest or rent
* Property taxes
* Utilities (like electric, gas, water)
* Homeowners/rental insurance
* Repairs or maintenance
* Depreciation (for homeowners)

If you’re unsure about expense categories, this [how-to on calculating home office deductions](https://fmtrust.bank/money-moves-article/how-to-calculate-home-office-deductions/) offers clear examples.

# Maximizing Savings: Common Mistakes to Avoid

There’s a reason the home office deduction makes people nervous during tax season — simple mistakes can mean missed savings or even an IRS audit. Here’s how to keep things clean and boost your deduction:

* **Don’t Claim Non-Business Spaces:** If you’re working at the kitchen table or letting a guest sleep in your office, you break the “exclusive use” rule. Only claim space meant solely for your business.
* **Partial Business Use Pitfalls:** If you use part of a room, measure carefully. Only the portion used strictly for work is deductible. Overestimating your square footage is a red flag.
* **Track Every Expense:** Save receipts for utilities, repairs, and upgrades. Spreadsheets or software can make it easy to sort expenses and calculate the right share, especially for fluctuating monthly bills.
* **Watch the Audit Triggers:** Big claims compared to your income, vague documentation, or claiming the deduction for a rarely used “office” are risky. Stick to the facts and keep organized records.
* **Don’t Forget Yearly Reviews:** If your office setup changes mid-year (you move or shrink your workspace), recalculate your deduction to match, and only claim for the months it qualifies.
* **Consult the** [**IRS’s Home Office Deduction Rules**](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-small-business-owners-can-deduct-their-home-office-from-their-taxes)**:** Review fresh updates each tax year to catch any new qualifications, limitations, or rates.

By understanding how to calculate home office deduction and avoiding these common mistakes, you reduce your risk and raise your refund potential. Organized records and a clear grasp of IRS guidelines make the process predictable — and much less stressful.

# Beyond Dollars: Non-Monetary Costs of Remote Work

Remote work saves time and can increase flexibility, but the costs don’t stop with money spent on tech or higher energy bills. Many people find working from home carries hidden social and emotional challenges that can’t be measured with a receipt or calculated in a home office deduction calculator. These non-monetary costs have real consequences on happiness, career paths, and mental health — sometimes without warning.

# Work-Life Balance and Mental Health Challenges

Photo by [Andrea Piacquadio](https://www.pexels.com/@olly)

Working from home often blurs the lines between work and personal life. When the living room or bedroom doubles as an office, it can be tough to know when to shut the laptop and actually relax. Many remote workers struggle to truly disconnect at the end of the day, which can build up stress over time.

Common mental health challenges reported by remote employees include:

* **Increased stress and anxiety** from “always on” expectations.
* **Difficulty unplugging** from work tasks — leading to longer hours, even after regular work time.
* **Feelings of isolation and loneliness** due to limited face-to-face contact.
* **Worsening anxiety or depression** for those already at risk.

It’s easy for video calls and “quick” emails to spill well past normal working hours, making it hard to reset and recharge. This pattern can drain your energy, affect sleep, and dampen motivation.

Research shows that without clear separation between work and home, more people report burnout and mental fatigue. The risk of depression and anxiety is also higher among full-time remote and hybrid workers compared to those at the office [(learn more here)](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/potential-downside-to-remote-work-higher-rates-depression). If these symptoms sound familiar, it’s not just you — there’s now strong evidence that remote work changes how we feel day-to-day [(see this review of mental health impacts)](https://hortoninternational.com/the-impact-of-remote-working-on-mental-health-pros-and-cons/).

Personal strategies such as setting clear boundaries, creating a set schedule, or having a dedicated workspace help some people. Still, not everyone has the luxury of spare rooms or a quiet place away from roommates or kids.

# Career Progression and Networking Limitations

Progress at work depends on more than just doing your job. It often comes from connecting with colleagues, learning from mentors, and being visible to decision-makers. In a remote setup, these chances are harder to come by.

Key non-monetary career drawbacks include:

* **Fewer networking opportunities** when there are no hallway chats or office lunches.
* **Limited informal learning** from overheard conversations or quick questions at a co-worker’s desk.
* **Reduced access to mentorship** since organic, daily guidance is less likely over video.
* **Lower visibility to managers**, which can slow promotions or keep you out of important projects.

Without the office “buzz,” it’s easy for remote workers to become invisible. Young employees or those new to a field may struggle to form strong connections, building only transactional relationships by email or chat. Even seasoned professionals might miss out on the trust and camaraderie that grow naturally in person.

Studies show these networking and mentorship gaps can hold back career growth for remote workers, with fewer being considered for raises or leadership opportunities compared to on-site peers [(see expert analysis here)](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/resources/costs-benefits). Building a strong network, learning on the job, and gaining feedback all take intentional effort — and that lift gets heavier from a distance.

While remote work changes the math of home office deductions and expenses, it also asks us to count less visible costs. Recognizing these challenges can help you set boundaries, create structure, and find ways — virtual or in person — to keep growing professionally and protect your mental health.

# Conclusion

Working from home gives flexibility but comes with a price. Setting up a home office, upgrading tech, paying higher utility bills, and losing out on workplace perks all add up. The less obvious costs — like stress, blurred boundaries, and slower career growth — can take a toll, too.

Knowing how home office deductions work and what the IRS rules for home office deduction say helps you avoid mistakes. Track your expenses, use a home office deduction calculator, and double-check the fine print to make work-from-home life pay off.

If you’re weighing remote work for the long haul, consider both your wallet and your wellbeing. The real savings come when you plan ahead, claim the right deductions, and set clear boundaries between work and home.

1kod2sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caregivingoptions/comments/1kod2sr/worst_places_to_retire_2025/,Worst Places To Retire 2025,"The ten worst places to retire listed below generally have higher taxes and crime rates, and inadequate healthcare facilities. So, before you change your address, consider carefully where you want to live (or don't want to live) before you move on.

# 1. Kentucky

Although Kentucky is known for its horse racing, bourbon, bluegrass music and southern hospitality, the state is prone to various natural disasters, including floods and tornadoes. That (and other things, like humidity and pesky bugs) lands Kentucky at the bottom in 2025, where it also landed in 2024.

Even so, the cost of living in Kentucky is about 19% lower than the U.S. average. Residents in Kentucky spend about $250 per week on food at home and $96 on eating out. In comparison, a meal at a high-end restaurant in New York City can cost upwards of $100 or more. The average home will set you back $208,456, up 5.8% over the past year.

Kentucky’s tax system generally suits retirees — there is no tax on Social Security and seniors also enjoy a sizable deduction of $31,110 per individual for other retirement income types such as IRA, 401(k), and pension income. But the overall quality of life and healthcare options are not the best.

# 2. Louisiana

Louisiana offers a diverse culture, great food and music. Housing costs are below average, but insurance rates can be high. Healthcare is important to senior citizens, and unfortunately, Louisiana doesn't rank very high.

Social Security Benefits[ ](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/602202/taxes-in-retirement-how-all-50-states-tax-retirees)aren't taxed in Louisiana, but retirement account withdrawals are. The state also has a relatively low cost of living, with housing and utility costs particularly low. The typical home price in Louisiana is only $196,979 according to Zillow, which is less than half the national average. Car insurance, though, averages just over $4,500 per year, 46% above average.

3. Mississippi

Mississippi is home to vibrant cities and wide expanses of natural beauty. It also offers many opportunities for outdoor recreation or just enjoying a slower pace of life. In 2024, the cost of living was 22% lower than the U.S. average, and the average home will only set you back $177,427, up 3.4% from 2024.

If you like a tepid climate, then Mississippi may be the best place to retire — it has a humid, subtropical climate with hot summers and mild to warm winters. But crime is high in many areas of the state and quality healthcare is harder to come by than in most other states. Mississippi is also prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which can lead to property damage and the need to find temporary housing.

4. Washington

Washington state has a lot to offer, from gorgeous mountains, long coastlines, many rivers, lakes, and, of course, great spots for coffee lovers. It also has plenty of rain, up to 120 inches per year in some places, which is not ideal for retirees who might want to enjoy the outdoors year-round.

Washington does not have state income taxes, so your retirement income, including pensions, 401(k)s, and IRAs, are not taxed by the state. Property taxes are relatively low, but housing prices can be high, averaging about $589,272, according to Zillow. Washington also boasts top-tier healthcare systems, with cities like Seattle and Spokane known for their medical centers and specialized healthcare services.

Besides that, everyday living expenses can put a strain on a fixed retirement budget. Groceries, healthcare, utilities and transportation costs are all higher than the national average.

5. New Mexico

New Mexico is a popular destination for retirees for many different reasons. And, while it is rich in culture and boasts beautiful landscapes, before you pack your bags, you should know it has been estimated that 30% of New Mexico’s rural roads are in poor condition. crime is high — over 3% higher than the national average — and medical facilities are sparse, especially in rural areas. That means you may need to travel long distances to access specialist care; a disadvantage for some seniors.

Overall, New Mexico has good weather with warm (sometimes very hot) summers and mild winters, but harsh weather conditions such as strong winds, dust storms, and wildfires are common.

On the upside, most retirees in the state don't pay state income tax[ ](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/602202/taxes-in-retirement-how-all-50-states-tax-retirees)on their social security benefits. Taxpayers age 65 and older can deduct up to $8,000 from their taxable income, and income for residents 100 years and older is completely tax-exempt. Retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs are partially taxed.

6. New Jersey

New⁢ Jersey⁤ offers a unique retirement⁢ experience ‍that calls for careful ⁣consideration. The Garden State​ is home to numerous retirement communities⁤ that⁣ cater specifically ⁣to ⁢the needs of older⁢ adults. However, the cost of living is relatively high⁢ compared to other ‌states — 19.8% higher than the US average — with housing, healthcare, and taxes typically more expensive. If you're on a fixed income, it's good to know that New Jersey is also known for its higher property tax rates..

The state’s weather can also be unpredictable at times, with hot and humid summers and harsh, snowy winters. So, if you prefer milder climates, keep this in mind. Also, New Jersey taxes most types of retirement income, with the exception of Social Security.

7. Rhode Island

Rhode Island offers beaches and scenic beauty, but the cost of living is high — 13% higher than the U.S. average. Buying a home in Rhode Island can also put a strain on your budget and set you back an average of $463,372. That's a 7.1% increase over 2024.

Taxes are also higher, although sales tax is lower than in many places in the U.S. Healthcare is rated high, but the state has fewer hospitals and healthcare facilities compared to larger states. If you drive, get ready to be stuck in traffic no matter the time of day.

8. West Virginia

West Virginia creeps into the top 10 worst places in the US to retire for a variety of reasons. The state ranks poorly for healthcare, ranking as the 46th-best state in the nation for elderly healthcare, which combines outcomes, cost, and ease of access to healthcare facilities.. West Virginia won't tax your Social Security Benefits, but it does tax withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA accounts and pensions, with some exclusions. The state has no estate tax.

The Mountain State's major cities are a considerable distance from each other, and you'll have to take winding routes to get there. This can make it challenging to visit friends and family, access specialty healthcare if needed or find cultural and entertainment options in the larger metropolitan areas.

9. Arkansas

Arkansas has a lower cost of living compared to many areas in the U.S., and healthcare, housing and groceries are all cheaper than the national average. The climate is temperate, allowing many opportunities for outdoor activities. On the downside, the state has high crime rates, including violent and property crime and a tough economy and lower education levels than many other areas of the country.

The state has many healthcare facilities, including major medical centers, but access to healthcare in more rural areas is limited. It is also home to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, a world-class facility that provides outstanding care for retirees. Although Social Security is not taxed, pensions, 401(k) and IRA distributions are.

10. Hawaii

The Aloha State has beautiful beaches, scenic landscapes, and many activities for retirees to enjoy. The weather is warm year around and crime is low. However, it can be very expensive to live in Hawaii. Gas, groceries, housing, property taxes and utilities are all very high, making it difficult if you're on a fixed income. For instance, the cost of living in Honolulu is 19.8% higher than the US average.

On a positive note, Social Security is not taxed. But 401(k) and IRA Distributions are taxable. Something else to consider is the lack of public transportation options. But even if you have a car, gas prices are sky-high. Hawaii also has tons of creepy critters like cockroaches and spiders in Hawaii.",1,1747432776.0,Caregivingoptions,0,1.0,False
1kod117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1kod117/how_do_you_make_catholic_friends/,How do you make Catholic friends?,"TLDR: 28 year old guy, almost nobody else my age at my parish. No young adults groups or ministries at my parish, no efforts to build a community at the parish or to have others get to know each other. Would like to make some Catholic friends, people with a shared faith and beliefs, can't find any Catholic young adult groups or anything around me, what do? 

Hey everyone, 

I've been wanting to and trying to get more involved in my parish and meet more Catholics around my age, I'm a 28 year old guy, but it's been slow to non-existent progress. I think part of the issue is I'm already an introvert and my parish is mostly either young families and older people. The whole area I live in, my hometown, isn't exactly a college town or a place people my age move to, rather out of. My parish doesn't have a young adults group or ministry, no coffee and donuts after Mass or anything, the closest would be a couple small evangelical and charismatic ministries.

I got commissioned as a Eucharist minister a few months back, it's been great, humbling, amazing that Christ chose someone like me to save from the shackles of my past and then to be able to minister to Him in the Eucharist. I'm the youngest Eucharist minister though, by like 20 years, and we don't do anything like a group prayer before Mass or anything.

I honestly feel like an alien at times, it's like everyone else my age here has either sadly left the faith, away doing something important somewhere big, or is married, started a family, and rightfully busy with their own lives. Then there's me, just keeping my head down, trying my best to keep growing closer to God and follow Christ, haven't really gotten into dating intentionally as all I've known before is the secular world and people, not much going on. The way I see it is God is keeping my life slow right now to give me a chance to grow closer to Him, so that I may grow personally and spiritually, and that's what I've been trying to do. People keep saying I should become a priest, joking that God has kept me unmarried for a reason, I did consider it a while ago, but idk, I eventually want to marry and start a family honestly.

Anyways, I can make friends at work and stuff fine, but I really would like to surround myself more with others who are on a similar spiritual path with the same Catholic faith. It's sad because there's always a lot of protestant groups and Bible studies, but almost nothing Catholic like that I see. What are some ways you get to know and make Catholic friends? Places I should go, sites where events are organized, etc.?

Thanks a lot! 

Edit: if it helps at all, without doxxing myself, I'm in Southern California, not LA though, more of a suburban area outside of LA consisting of families and original homeowners. ",4,1747432632.0,Catholicism,3,1.0,False

1kocwis,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kocwis/does_the_runnatal_ta01201c_toaster_truly_deliver/,Does the Runnatal TA01201C Toaster Truly Deliver? In-Depth Review Inside!,"The Runnatal TA01201C-UL toaster has become a part of my daily routine in the kitchen, and honestly, it’s earned its spot on my countertop. Designed with a stainless steel finish, it gives an upscale metallic touch that’s both sleek and practical, blending into my modern kitchen decor effortlessly. With its compact size, it doesn’t overcrowd the counter, leaving room for my coffee maker and other essentials. I’ve been testing it out on everything from classic sliced bread to more adventurous bagels and waffles, and it has some standout features that I feel are worth pointing out.

**Outstanding Design and Functionality**  
This toaster takes its design seriously, balancing aesthetics with practicality. Its dimensions, 5.51""D x 9.8""W x 6.69""H, make it perfect for smaller kitchens or those with limited countertop space. What stood out to me is how lightweight it is, weighing just over 2.5 pounds. Moving it around is a breeze. The clean lines and smooth stainless steel surface aren’t just for show—they’re super easy to wipe down when it gets smudged. Plus, the power cord storage underneath helps keep things tidy when it’s not in use.

**Positives**  
- The toaster has seven adjustable settings for toast levels, so I get the crispiness I want every time.  
- The crumb tray is easy to slide out, clean, and pop back in—a game-changer for hassle-free maintenance.  
- It offers a BAGEL function that toasts one side perfectly while leaving the other side soft.  
- Compact size prevents clutter while providing just enough room for two slices.  

**Performance and Versatility**  
Using this toaster has been far from boring because of how versatile it is. My mornings now include a variety of crispy bagels, toast, and even quick waffles when I’m craving something sweet. The multifunctional nature of this appliance comes to life with its defrost, bagel, and cancel buttons. The defrost feature is especially handy when I forget to take bread out of the freezer the night before. I’d say I use the BAGEL function more often than I thought I would—it toasts bagels evenly, but I did notice that only one side gets baked. This is a quirky feature that takes some getting used to.

[Grab Runnatal TA01201C-UL at the best price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0byynt5ct/)

**Drawbacks**  
- Toasting a single slice of bread often results in a darker hue compared to two slices side-by-side.  
- The BAGEL function’s one-sided toasting could be confusing for users unaware of this limitation.  
- Lack of advanced customization, like a “keep warm” feature, might leave some users wanting more.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other options on the market, like the Breville Smart Toaster or the Cuisinart CPT-180, the Runnatal toaster holds its ground for practicality and daily usability. Breville’s toasters might offer more tech-savvy features such as a motorized lift, but they come at a much higher price. Similarly, the Cuisinart CPT-180 has dual control panels but lacks the intuitive simplicity of the Runnatal model. If simplicity, compact design, and reliable performance outweigh tech-forward features for you, this toaster checks those boxes convincingly.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The value this toaster offers is notable. Sure, it doesn’t boast complex functions or state-of-the-art features, but for its price range, it delivers what most people, including myself, actually need from a toaster—a reliable, efficient appliance for toasting bread, bagels, and similar items. Compared to higher-end brands, it manages to balance cost and functionality beautifully.

I’ve bought a perfect machine for my home. A true masterpiece. The guy at the store told me I’d be making such good espresso, it’d be worth the massive investment of $1150. You’ve read that right. I’ve got THAT much invested into my coffee! Yes, because coffee is an investment to life, it’s a symphony of caffeine and taste. As a true connoisseur of the good things, I’ve decided to treat myself right and buy such an expensive piece of equipment. And please, don’t try to shame me for spending so much on a machine, you just don’t understand the feeling.

But now here is the kicker. I’ve decided to step away from the pre ground at my supermarket and upgrade to cafe bought coffee. Only the best for my Italian beauty. So I’ve found myself a cafe near my shop. At first they were reluctant to let me taste all of their beans, but after mentioning my machine, they knew I meant business. After the tasting session I’ve decided to pick a bean and I bought a 2 lb bag of it, because this coffee was EXPENSIVE!! and they would only agree to a discount with a large bag.

I then asked them to grind it, they did a custom grind setting according to my machines ideal pressure of 15 bar and I must say, those first shots were so damn sweet and perfect! But now.. these cheap bastards at this unacceptable excuse of a cafe… they bought a cheap grinder! 

I’m now halfway through my bag after 6 weeks. The coffee is shit now. It doesn’t extract as nice anymore even though my superior machine is still beautifully extracting at 15 bars. It must be their CHEAP grinder that screwed up and ground the bottom half of my coffee wrong! How do I tell them to upgrade their grinder? This is unacceptable! I can’t be doing this to my premium espresso machine! ",2,1747432111.0,espressocirclejerk,2,1.0,False

I will keep this as short as possible. 

Earlier I was out shopping, all of a sudden a guy approaches me, compliments me, we then have a discussion. He politely asks me to join him for a coffee later this afternoon, I politely declined as I already had plans and I had a work project to complete. **I tell him this.** Then I suggest that he take down my number and we can schedule a coffee date SOMETIME this weekend, meaning tomorrow or Sunday. Guy agrees, we part ways. 

A few minutes later I receive a text from this guy, informing me that, this is his number, and to save it. I respond and save his number. He responds two hours later telling me “let’s meet tomorrow at 12pm”. 

I, am occupied and busy, just as I told him I would be. A few hours pass and as I start responding to his text message by thanking him for being patient with me and that I will inform him of a time to meet with him as soon as I am able to, he then deletes my number (his profile picture disappears) a few hours later it reappears, I then follow it up with the time I am able to meet with him and the message can now, not be delivered at all. 

Do I understand attachment styles? Definitely. 
Do I understand people have different expectations? Absolutely. 
Has this left me feeling taken aback? Yes. I literally met the guy a few hours before I responded back to his text message. I literally informed him of my schedule for the afternoon. 

What is even more bizarre is he, is in his late twenties.

I've been talking to this girl for about a year now. We've gone shopping, had coffee and dinners, just the two of us and sometimes with my friends. Our connection has always felt a bit on-and-off, but every time we meet, I genuinely enjoy our conversations. She asks deep questions, and we often talk about things that feel rare and meaningful.

Recently, we had a small get-together with my friends, and I invited her. She came, and everything felt great. Afterward, one of my friends told me, “You've been seeing each other for a while, you should just ask her out.” Before she left that night, she even said we could plan something for the weekend.

So, I finally gathered the courage to officially ask her out on a date, over text. But now it's been two days and I haven't heard anything back. Not even a simple reply. It’s been eating me up inside.

I don’t understand how, after everything, after a year of knowing each other, of spending time together, she could just goes silent. It makes me feel like a fool. Am I just unlikeable? Am I not worth it? I’m feeling confused, hurt, and honestly,  lost.",1,1747432053.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I (33m) dated a woman whom I'll call Lily back in highschool. We hooked up a few times but when I was 18 she told me that she was pregnant. I told her I didn't want to be a father and would pay to make this go away. 

In the state we conceived a parent can avoid child support by waiving their parental rights and any potential for custody. This was fine by me since, as I mentioned, I wanted nothing to do with the child. We parted ways and I moved to a new town and a new state on the other side of the country. That was nearly 15 years ago.

Since then I met my current wife who I'll call Eve. We have 2 beautiful children together and up until recently life was great. That was until Lilly moved to the same county as us. This was not intentional afaik, as such when Lily saw me on Facebook she sent a friend request and then we chatted and agreed to meet up for coffee with my wife's permission of course. We had a friendly conversation about how our lives were going and Lily talked about her career and I spoke about mine. Halfway through the conversation a teenage boy entered the coffee shop and walked up to Lily and asked her for money to go to GameStop with his friends. The boy noticed me and I gave a polite hello, after she gave him cash he left after saying goodbye to me and his mom. After he was gone I asked if that was the child we conceived and he said yes. She told me how she had a husband after me but he died in Afghanistan just before the war ended leaving her with their 2 daughters and my bio-son. I didn't even ask her for his name and the conversation went back to other mundane adult things to catch up on, like sports, hobbies, and the weather. We parted ways after a brief but heartfelt apology that things didn't work between the two of us. Her response was a chuckle and a remark on how she got more from the state to help her with Jacob (bio-son’s name) than I could have ever provided in child support. 

About a week later I was at work when I was called to the front office where my boss told me that a boy came by asking for me and he said he was my son. I asked them what he said his name was and they said it was Jacob. I got really mad and called Lily to ask what happened. Lily said she told Jacob who I was and that Jacob got really quiet before she told him that I didn't want anything to do with this kid, she told me she'd have another talk with him about my boundaries and apologized for him. I thought this would be the end of it but things kept getting worse. 

Two days later I was in line at a local donut shop getting donuts for the shop, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned and saw Jacob. To say I felt immediately uncomfortable would be an understatement, it felt like my heart fell through my stomach. Jacob immediately called me Dad and explained that he just wanted to talk and get to know me. I told him his mother and I agreed for no contact between the two of us and I ignored him while I ordered and left. 

For the next few months I ran into him frequently and I shrugged him off each time. But then my worst nightmare came true. He was in highschool and his school worked with local businesses to offer paid internships to students. Jacob somehow got an internship with my company. We do sign work and embroidery, I work as a graphic designer for them and Jacob was put under me which meant I spent 15-20 hours every week with this kid. I spoke to my boss who told me there was nothing she could do, I spoke to Lily who immediately began screaming at Jacob while I was still on the phone about breaching privacy before profusely apologizing to me about his behavior. She told me she would talk to the school the next day but afterwards she told me the school had no more internships to move him to. I resigned myself to dealing with my (literal) bastard son for the next several months. 

Fast forward to Christmas time, we had our annual Christmas party, which the interns are invited to. At the party my wife and I kept our distance from Jacob. But halfway through the party Jacob began coming up to me to talk and I kept shutting down conversation. My wife, who knows I have a son but not about the harassment, scolded me for not talking to my intern but then Jacob did the most socially inept thing I could have imagined, he told her he was my son. I immediately shut down the conversation and my wife and I left the party. 

On my way home I was fuming when my wife asked if he was the kid I had with my ex. I told her yes and I noticed a look in her eyes that concerned me. The next day she told me she thought I should let Jacob into my life. I told her under no circumstances would I do that. We have routinely argued about Jacob at least once a month for the last several months. But recently my wife crossed the line.

It started when she told my mother that I don't want to raise my own son (my mom knows about Lily and knows about Jacob) and tried to get my mom to guilt me into accepting Jacob and to start a CO parenting situation with Lily. But during my mom's recent visit I came home one afternoon to my wife, my mom and Jacob with my other kids in the living room. My wife looked so pleased with herself as I laid eyes on Jacob. I told him he had to leave immediately and my wife started scolding me for kicking him out. My mother told me that Eve had said that I patched things up with Jacob and wanted him in my life after all and was horrified she got suckered into this. My wife tried to smooth things over but I ended up getting so angry I kicked a hole in a closet door and went to my friend's house where I've been for the last several days. 

My wife says I'm cruel for denying Jacob a father, and Jacob is just an obsessed teenage boy who seems like he's never had a proper father figure in his life and my wife is feeding into his delusions that I want anything to do with him. So, reddit am I the asshole?

I absolutely see why. On the initial sniff, the aroma was very pleasant and complex. You are hit with immediate cherry and fruit notes fading into coffee-like salted caramel.  There’s a slight smokiness that’s nice and present and not too dominant as well.

The first sip follows with a similar enjoyable grouping of flavors. At first, you get this honey fruit and spice that tails into a gentle sweetness that covers the tongue and leaves a slight smokiness. It’s really quite pleasant, and I wish the finish lasted a bit longer. 

The finish leaves notes of sweet caramel and a bit of smokiness and spice. There’s not a very strong tailing ethanol taste, which is also quite pleasant.

T&ke Rating: 8.6 

I think this is by far my favorite of the JW offerings so far, and its only real weakness is its mellow and short finish. Overall, this bottle shines in the lineup and would be a great pick.",1,1747431834.0,whiskey,0,1.0,False

So, I have a gigantic crush on one of my coworkers.

When she started, I immediately noticed her, as she's drop dead gorgeous. I was in a relationship at the time, so it didn't progress into anything other than that.

After my relationship ended, we started talking a little more at work. We work at a music venue as bartenders and we don't work at the same bar a lot. When we did, though, we hit it off. She's really easy to talk to, funny, has great taste in music. We started joking around a lot and I noticed that she giggles at damn near everything that comes out of my mouth. She also talks to me more than she talks to anyone else at work.

I went to the holiday party for our work. She showed up a while after I did. I was on my way to the bathroom when I turned my head and saw her standing at the bar. I legit got a little adrenaline shock. I continued on to the bathroom and was like ""Alright, Beavis. Calm down.""

When I came back out, another coworker came up to me to say goodbye and said ""Hey, go talk to her."" I said okay. She said ""No, really, GO TALK TO HER.""

So, I walked right up to her and we immediately locked in and had a deep conversation. It went on for about an hour. We were laughing and she was smiling at me and any attempt by anyone to talk to us got froze out. It felt really, really good.

Then we went to the afterparty.

At this point, she had a couple few drinks in her and we went outside so she could smoke some weed. She told me that she was seeing someone and she didn't seem all that stoked about it. I was bummed, too, but I took it in stride. The rest of the night wasn't anywhere near as cool, because she was combo'd out.

I ended up giving her a ride home. She got my phone number. Hugged me and said goodbye three times. It felt like she wanted me to kiss her and it felt like she didn't really want to get out of my car.

There's no way in hell I was going to kiss her. I've got personal boundaries with that and it would've been a shitty thing for me to do to her.

I went home and felt bittersweet about the whole thing. She texted me back the next day to thank me for the ride home and apologize for dumping personal stuff on me and for being drunk.

Since then, we see each other at work and everything is always cool. We have more fun with each other now, to be honest. Even when I think I do something stupid or unattractive, it's proven that it's all in my head. When we talk, we have a hard time stopping. One of the last shifts we worked together, I had to pee and her station was near the bathroom. I stopped to talk to her a bit and I hit crisis levels in my bladder. I was literally doing that thing where you back away from someone to get out of the conversation and I finally had to cut it off because she wasn't picking up on it.

From where I sit, it's pretty clear that there's a mutual attraction. My therapist agrees. That said, she doesn't ever text first. I text her maybe once a month. The second to last time was about hanging out, but she was at work. I was kinda bummed and overanalyzed it. Our next shift together, I was anxious before she came in, but she sat right down next to me all smiley and everything was great.

After we work together, I FLOAT for days afterwards. I daydream about her and it makes me feel really good. It's pretty much always about just getting coffee together and it turning into an all day date.

I haven't asked her out to do that because I don't know if she's still seeing someone. Also, like I said, she doesn't initiate texting at all. She always answered my texts, even when she's been out of town.

Until this weekend.

She has four cats and I just moved into a house with five. One of the cats jumped up on my lap while I was reading and was looking right at the book, so I took a picture and sent it to her and got no response back.

I wasn't going to text her until after the weekend because I was going to a show that night and the third anniversary of my close friend's death was the next day. I have ADHD and the Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria hits me super fucking hard. Honestly, it prevents me from even pursuing anyone most of the time.

So, she didn't text back and I'm sitting her a week later, totally fucking depressed.

I took some quizzes online last night and had a therapy session about this two weeks ago. The results that are coming back is that I have some aspects of limerence for her.

I know deep down for a fact that I have been limerent for other women in my life.

What I'm feeling right now is very similar to how I've felt when I've experienced rejection in those other situations.

I think about her constantly. I really, really want her to like me back. I overanalyze the shit out of everything. I get nervous and excited when she's around. Sometimes, I dread seeing her, even though it's always great. I have stalked her social media, but I haven't added her on Instagram on purpose. I know it will drive me nuts.

I don't put her on a pedestal, though. That night at the work party raised a couple red flags, too. Also, I'm five years sober and it'd be cooler if she didn't get high.

The highs are so damn high and the lows are soooo damn low. I was close to tears earlier today. I can easily picture myself doing this until either one of us quits that job and I never see her again. I'd probably still carry a torch for her afterwards.

Right now, it feels pretty apparent to me that she doesn't feel the same way about me. I still think there's mutual attraction, but she could still be seeing someone or maybe she just doesn't want to date a coworker. It feels like I should really pull back from her at work, because this is utter fucking agony over someone that I really don't know all that well.

I've been in therapy for five years and I think I've worked on a lot of the things that caused me to be limerent in the past. This situation does feel a lot different in that I have self-awareness about how I'm operating in within it. It's not interfering with my life as much as other situations did, either.

Still, I feel that all this begs the question: Is this limerence?

I just need to get some insight from other limerent people. I could use some advice, too, as I've been there before and I don't wanna be there again.

My husband and I are really struggling financially. I have student loan payments ($22,000 altogether) I’m about a year behind on and need to start paying because my credit is being affected. We both have credit card debt that is defaulted (probably 2500 all together) and we need to start making payments on from when we turned 18 and thought it was cool. Amongst other things, we’re starting medicated cycles to try to get pregnant next month after trying for 2 years with no natural luck and I don’t want to be going through living paycheck to paycheck when we have a child.  

My husband works for a car lot and is commission only. The last few months he’s been bringing in maybe $1200. I’m a nurse and I make about $3300 a month and will start receiving a bonus in July for around $1500 every three months (which I plan on putting that towards our debt). The only solution I see right now is picking up as many shifts as I can until we’re good again.

Not included in that is the $10 my husband spends about 5 days a week stopping at the gas station for his drinks for work, and what we spend on gas which is probably $150 a month altogether. I also get coffee when I work, so maybe $7 3 days a week.

For context, our AT&T bill is going to be lower soon because had 2 other people on our plan that we recently took off. They weren’t paying their part. We also have someone living with us (unexpected - close family member’s spouse died and they had nowhere to go) but they contribute $100 for “rent” and buy all the groceries. We also have both needed to have dental work done unexpectedly which was about $150 a piece. 

Anyone have any suggestions or advice? I know we’ve made some bad decisions. We just need some help getting out of this. Our bank account is usually always in the negatives. We’re tired of it. ",2,1747431688.0,budget,2,1.0,False

Today was my last day of work, I'm leaving for a summer internship but plan to return in the fall.

Over the past year, I developed a sort of friendship with a regular, ""Steve,"" who’s in his 60s. We’ve had about five casual conversations whenever my ten-minute breaks happened to line up with his visits. He used to work in finance, and since I’m currently studying finance in college, we’d chat about that and other random topics. He’s always seemed like a chill, neighborly figure.

Since he knew it was my last day, he gave me a thoughtful note wishing me luck with my internship. He included his phone number and said I could reach out if I ever wanted to talk or had finance-related questions. After work, I texted him a quick hello, and he called me. We ended up having a pretty long conversation that felt friendly and easygoing.

Toward the end of the call, though, he asked what I was doing tonight. I said I didn’t have much planned, just reviewing some onboarding materials. Then he asked if I wanted to “get together and get dinner or watch a movie.” I told him I had things to go over but maybe another time. He said that was fine, and added that his generation is used to paying, so I shouldn’t worry.

I like him in a platonic, neighborly way, but I’m not sure what he meant by “get together.” Was it just a friendly offer to hang out, or something more?

HepatoBurn Reviews



What is HepatoBurn?

HepatoBurn is a dietary supplement developed to support liver health and enhance fat metabolism through a targeted blend of botanical extracts and natural compounds.



Unlike standard liver detox products that focus solely on cleansing, HepatoBurn integrates a dual-action approach liver purification and fat burning. This positions it uniquely among metabolic health supplements.



The formulation is designed for individuals dealing with sluggish liver function, non-alcoholic fatty liver, or weight management issues. By addressing the root cause of fat accumulation inefficient liver performance it promotes a more balanced and sustained fat loss mechanism.



Manufactured in GMP-certified facilities, HepatoBurn claims to adhere to high quality and purity standards. Its plant-based ingredients also make it suitable for most health-conscious users.



How Does HepatoBurn Work?

HepatoBurn stimulates the liver’s natural detoxification processes and enhances the body’s ability to metabolize fats effectively.



When liver function is compromised, fat can accumulate more readily in the liver and bloodstream, leading to weight gain and systemic inflammation. This supplement optimizes fat oxidation by supporting bile production, which aids in lipid digestion and nutrient absorption.



Additionally, it improves mitochondrial efficiency, which helps cells utilize fat for energy more effectively. The result is a higher resting metabolic rate, improved fat utilization, and decreased fatty buildup in the liver.



HepatoBurn also helps manage oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which can impair liver function and slow metabolism.



This multi-dimensional support not only revitalizes hepatic performance but also enhances energy levels, and digestive health, contributing to better overall wellness without relying on stimulants or synthetic chemicals.



HepatoBurn Ingredients

A science-backed blend that targets liver function, enhances metabolic activity, and supports overall wellness through cellular-level liver support.



Resveratrol

Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in red grapes and berries known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It supports liver regeneration and combats oxidative stress. By improving insulin sensitivity, it indirectly aids metabolic health.



Camellia Sinensis

Camellia Sinensis, derived from green tea, helps boost thermogenesis and fat oxidation. It promotes healthy liver enzyme activity and supports detox pathways. Its catechins also help reduce oxidative liver damage.



Genistein

Genistein, a soy-derived isoflavone, has been shown to influence fat metabolism and estrogen regulation. It supports liver cell function and may protect against lipid accumulation. Its antioxidant properties contribute to hepatic resilience.



Chlorogenic Acid

Chlorogenic Acid, primarily from coffee beans, helps regulate blood sugar and slow fat absorption. It reduces fat accumulation in liver tissues and supports bile flow. Its metabolic benefits are also linked to reduced inflammation.



Choline

Choline is essential for fat transport and liver detoxification. It prevents the accumulation of fat in the liver by aiding lipid metabolism. Choline deficiency is directly linked to fatty liver disease.



Silymarin

Silymarin, extracted from milk thistle, is one of the most researched liver-support compounds. It repairs damaged liver cells and protects against toxins. It also enhances protein synthesis within hepatic tissues.



Betaine

Betaine helps process amino acids and supports liver methylation, a crucial detox pathway. It aids in reducing homocysteine and fat accumulation. Betaine is also essential for cellular hydration and repair.



Berberine

Berberine is known for its blood sugar-lowering and lipid-regulating effects. It improves insulin sensitivity and activates AMPK, a metabolic master switch. It supports liver fat metabolism and reduces inflammation.



Molybdenum

Molybdenum is a trace mineral involved in enzyme function, including those crucial for detoxification. It helps break down harmful sulfites and supports liver enzyme systems. It’s essential for efficient toxin elimination.



Glutathione

Glutathione is the body’s master antioxidant that protects liver cells from oxidative damage. It plays a central role in detoxification and supports liver regeneration. Adequate levels are crucial for cellular health and longevity.",0,1747431253.0,Political_Tumor,3,0.5,False

HepatoBurn Reviews



What is HepatoBurn?

HepatoBurn is a dietary supplement developed to support liver health and enhance fat metabolism through a targeted blend of botanical extracts and natural compounds.



Unlike standard liver detox products that focus solely on cleansing, HepatoBurn integrates a dual-action approach liver purification and fat burning. This positions it uniquely among metabolic health supplements.



The formulation is designed for individuals dealing with sluggish liver function, non-alcoholic fatty liver, or weight management issues. By addressing the root cause of fat accumulation inefficient liver performance it promotes a more balanced and sustained fat loss mechanism.



Manufactured in GMP-certified facilities, HepatoBurn claims to adhere to high quality and purity standards. Its plant-based ingredients also make it suitable for most health-conscious users.



How Does HepatoBurn Work?

HepatoBurn stimulates the liver’s natural detoxification processes and enhances the body’s ability to metabolize fats effectively.



When liver function is compromised, fat can accumulate more readily in the liver and bloodstream, leading to weight gain and systemic inflammation. This supplement optimizes fat oxidation by supporting bile production, which aids in lipid digestion and nutrient absorption.



Additionally, it improves mitochondrial efficiency, which helps cells utilize fat for energy more effectively. The result is a higher resting metabolic rate, improved fat utilization, and decreased fatty buildup in the liver.



HepatoBurn also helps manage oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which can impair liver function and slow metabolism.



This multi-dimensional support not only revitalizes hepatic performance but also enhances energy levels, and digestive health, contributing to better overall wellness without relying on stimulants or synthetic chemicals.

1koch7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1koch7e/philips_4400_grinder_issue/,Philips 4400 - Grinder Issue?,"Recently purchased the Philips 4400 Superautomatic (have always wanted one). Model is EP4444. 

Set it up last week. Using Intelligentsia House Blend beans (probably should have done a bit more research). Even so, so far so good. After setting up decided to adjust the machine to a grind setting of 3. Seemed to be working flawlessly. Earlier this week the machine has started to consistently not grind coffee even though there is plenty of beans in the top. It will go to grind and just make a “whirring” noise. It will then only start to grind when I move or apply pressure to the top of the grinder (black circle cap). I’ve removed the Brew Group and cleaned it twice, cleaned the ground coffee shute, and several other troubleshooting. 

Do I need to contact Philips for an RMA or is there something I’m missing here? Any help would be appreciated!",1,1747431163.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1koch4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1koch4n,Listening/Sitting Room Design,"First time poster, looking for some guidance. Just bought a place and we’re looking to turn this room into a stereo/reading/kid free chill out space (family/TV room is elsewhere). 

To orient you, the front door is at about 7 o’clock on the overhead view. 3 o’clock leads to the “formal” dining space. 

In the space I’m looking to place a couch and then leather chair, with one or both usable for listening. I have two free standing speakers, not huge, but decent size, maybe 18” square.  I will also need a small low table for the amp/turntable. 

Basically I want to get suggestions on high level layout. Speakers flank the bay window? The fireplace? Do I go coffee table too? Would probably want an ottoman for the chair if that’s going to be the primary listening spot. 

I know it’s generally poor design to walk into the room facing the back of a couch, but also I love having low table and speakers flank the window.

Elsewhere, With Others / The Dauntless

  
  


  
  


“Sir!” The eager voice of Private Stream exclaims and Admiral Cistern looks up. “Do you have the time?”

  
  


“I do.”

  
  


“Do we have the privacy?” The young looking towards the desk with an impish grin.

  
  


“We do.” He says simply.

  
  


“I’m being serious here, we got something kinda touchy. Can I do a sweep?” Private Stream asks as he carries over a tray with a pot of coffee he uses to refill his mug and sets it down as well as a customized private communicator.

  
  


“You may, I presume I am to activate this when you’re finished with the sweep?”

  
  


“When I’m finished explaining things after the sweep.” Private Stream says before rushing around the room, collecting four different little bugs and then dropping them into a trytite box. He then checks the room again and finds nothing, then a third time and finds a final bug. Then sweeps AGAIN to make sure.

  
  


Positive that he’s got all of it he puts the bugs outside and then stands at ease in front of his desk after locking the door. Hist stance shifts ever so and he can make out all his face. This isn’t just A Private Stream, this is the original model. The cute act that one of his best assassins and spies puts on social stealth.

  
  


The face he wears to get away with blatant murder.

  
  


“Alright then, what are we dealing with? Does it have anything to do with the surge in ultraviolet laser based assassinations and similar weapons being seen in the hands of criminal gangs?”

  
  


“Actually no, we found one of the major distributors and are moving out. It’s a bit of a mess still, but we’re still grinding at it. This is political, but private. It involves the guests that my brother’s been entertaining.” Herbert explains.

  
  


“The Vishanyan, bipedal serpentine species. Similar to tailless Miak but with considerably longer necks and larger hoods with a powerful stealth field.”

  
  


“And prickly nature. Yes. They’re reaching out sir.” Herbert says.

  
  


“Ah, hence the need for privacy.”

  
  


“Nothing like respecting the other side’s culture to grease the wheels of diplomacy.” Herbert remarks before snapping a salute. “One of their Admirals, one Admiral Fallows, is on the other side of that communicator sir, I will stand guard at the entrance and ensure that your conversation is uninterrupted and private.”

  
  


“Good man.” Admiral Cistern states with a nod as Herbert moves to his guard position and puts his head against the back of the door. Clearly listening for anyone approaching. Cistern activates the communicator. The image of the long necked, serpent headed woman is somewhat odd. But he powers through. “Admiral Fallows I presume?”

  
  


“I am.” She answers.

  
  


“I am Grand Admiral Garfield Cistern of The Undaunted. For the sake of conversational ease, Admiral, Cistern or Admiral Cistern will do.”

  
  


“Understood. Admiral Fallows will suffice for myself.” She responds.

  
  


“Very good Admiral Fallows, I understand you wish to speak with me. I have not been informed as to why and this is the first truly official contact between the Vishanyan and The Undaunted.” Admiral Cistern states and Admiral Fallows nods.

  
  


“Very good. I am Admiral Fallows. I have been placed in charge of an initiative to see whether or not we can actually step out into the galaxy.” She states.

  
  


“I see, and to what end are The Undaunted part of your plan?”

  
  


“A significant portion. You have control of an Arcology on the world of Zalwore do you not?”

  
  


“We do.”

  
  


“Would you be amenable to allowing us to use part of it? Restrict access to some components and allow us to build within it?”

  
  


“For what purpose? I understand that your society seeks to remain in secret and therefore opening a public embassy on one of the most trafficked worlds in the galaxy would be counter to those patterns.”

  
  


“Which would why it would be a hidden and private embassy. A first sample to see if opening up a semi-permanent, or even permanent presence beyond our own territory is wise.”

  
  


“A test. I see. And there is indeed room. However, the question of what you will be doing becomes even more relevant. Zalwore is a training facility and a rapid response hub. There is a large enough population in even a less populated arcology that it’s nearly guaranteed that your base will be discovered, and that’s IF I agree to this. You and your people are... not on the best terms. You have attacked an ally of ours and have made no official communications until now, where you are now asking for us to take a large risk onto ourselves.”

  
  


“And what do you want?”

  
  


“I want proper communication. In full. You want us to trust you? Then you must make a show of trust to begin with.”

  
  


“You wish for a direct communication with the Admiralty.” She says.

  
  


“I need to speak frankly with your people, unless of course you speak for all of them?” Admiral Cistern asks and Admiral Fallows looks away from the communicator and clearly to someone else in her vicinity.

  
  


“My superiors are listening in on this conversation.” Admiral Fallows says.

  
  


“Then you should all understand that allowing an unknown to construct a base within a base of my own is tactically insane. Now I do understand that you are reaching out and that this is an important step for your species as well as a potential great advantage to The Undaunted. As such, we need to discuss terms and limitations, on both sides, before any agreement can be reached. We need to know each other, and as much as your forces have been introduced to several of mine, you have been withholding information from us.”

  
  


“And what do you need to know?”

  
  


“What will your forces be doing with this base? I have no issue with an outreach program on Undaunted property, but a terrorist cell is another thing entirely. So what is it that you want to do with this base? Are you asking me to put a bomb near my people? Is this a hospital or sanctuary? A research outpost perhaps?”

  
  


“Research outpost would be the closest to what we’re attempting. Coupled with a safe house. I am not authorized to release the details as of yet, but suffice to say, my people are cautious and seek to keep ourselves safe through obscurity. Something that your organization has compromised.”

  
  


“Only because you have made attacks upon our allies.”

  
  


“One. One attack that has been disavowed within our own organizations.”

  
  


“That’s wonderful, but it still had a negative impact upon multiple individuals and involved multiple steps that risked many, many lives, ranging from the usurpation of authority to facilitate a massacre, to hijacking of government assets and also leading to the production and attempted use of weapons of mass destruction. To say nothing of a flurry of lesser crimes in the process. I now owe The Empress of Serbow a favour to keep things calm and protect your people. And considering that she is a master politician, well... do I need to elaborate further just how much you and your people already are in debt.”

  
  


“We did not ask you to do that.”

  
  


“Would you like me to retract it then? Your aggression and paranoia have placed you into a situation where NOT being your enemy is a difficult and expensive thing to do. So please, don’t make this any harder, and for your own sake, do not make this so hard that writing you off as a bad investment is the wiser course.”

  
  


“Step aside Admiral Fallows.” A new voice says and she shifts quickly before another Vishanyan steps into view. She is more decorated, holds herself higher, and there is a shift in the scales along her neck suggesting a healed wound. She simply regards Admiral Cistern for a time. “I am willing to make a deal with you human.”

  
  


“And that is?”

  
  


“The claims you have made. About this... favour. If it can be verified, then I will release our information to you. If you have already personally invested into and supported us, then I will see you rewarded. But if you are lying then we will vanish until a time of OUR choosing. And we will not be requesting things, but taking.” Grand Admiral Longitude states.

  
  


“Private Stream. Gather the records and bring them here.” Admiral Cistern says lenaing to the side to address Herbert who salutes. “And you are madam?”

  
  


“Grand Admiral Longitude.”

  
  


“A pleasure.”

  
  


“Got the records sir!” Private Stream says bouncing up with a data-chip.

  
  


“Thank you Private Stream.” Admiral Cistern says before plugging in the data-chip. He then begins uploading the data. Grand Admiral Longitude taps the side of her head and several scales flicker with electronic lights before fading.

  
  


“I see... very well Admiral Cistern, it appears that we have more friends than we assumed. Let us speak more frankly.”

“Not sure why you’re all following me around. The tour has finished and I’m technically off duty at the moment.” Harold notes as he does his normal push ups and then switches into one handed ones.

  
  


“We’re trying to... to... can you please stand up and speak, you’re distracting while acting in such a way.” Torment states.

  
  


“Can’t, I have a system.”

  
  


“It’s just basic push ups.”

  
  


“There are spare bands to the side. See the ones on my upper and lower arms? Also thighs and ankles? Headband and belt? They’re weighted and have a totem to up the weight exponentially.” Harold says before suddenly pushing up hard and clapping, then dropping to push up and clap, drop, push, clap.

  
  


Torment moves to the side and then her eyes widen as she picks up one of the bands. It’s enormously heavy. Easily fifty pounds. And he’s all but flying through his workout, but if all the bands are a fifty pounds each, then he has five hundred on his person and that’s assuming the larger belt isn’t a greater weight.

  
  


“Is there a reason you’re pushing so hard, and with minimal Axiom use?” Torment asks.

  
  


“Need better conditioning. I need to be stronger, tougher, faster.” Harold says before suddenly shifting his workout. He flips upwards and balances on his fingertips before lifting himself to the ceiling in a handstand push up.

  
  


“And why are you so obsessed with being stronger?”

  
  


“Because, it defines me. Make no mistake, I have my own issues and problems. But I have made the choice to be the strongest I can, to be the best I can, because I will have it be mine. It will be me. Therefore I will push to be it.” Harold says.

  
  


“Just like that?” Torment asks.

  
  


“Well everyone defines themselves somehow, this is how I define myself, ever self improving.” Harold remarks before he shifts the lifting until he’s balanced on the fingertips of one hand with five hundred pounds weighing down his body. He slowly does ten push ups, the switches the hand. “How do you define yourself?”

  
  


“Soldier, dutiful. Torment.” Torment says.

  
  


“Without listing your job or name.” Harold clarifies.

  
  


“... Dutiful.”

  
  


“Dutiful is good. But there’s more right?” Harold asks as he slowly lowers himself and then stands up again before slowly rolling his limbs and then slowly moving through a kata, still weighed down by things and keeping himself still and controlled.

  
  


“... I am strong, capable and wise.”

  
  


“Good... keep going. I am Ever Stronger, Enthusiastic, Curious and Audacious.” Harold says.

  
  


“... I am stoic, reserved and cautious.”

  
  


“Excellent traits. I have negative ones too, I am impulsive, aggravating and knowingly arrogant.”

  
  


“...” Torment says nothing.

  
  


“It’s always harder to admit flaws over virtues.” Harold says.

  
  


“Knowingly arrogant?” Torment asks.

  
  


“I bite off way more than I can chew and only the good grace of my sparring partners have kept me alive.” Harold says as his kata moves into karate style punches. Slowly punching outwards and then chambering the fist. Bringing to his mind almost mechanical motions or the idea that his fists were like bullets or cannonballs at full speed. “After all, a Battle Princess has overwhelmed my Axiom Brand, Franklin had the good grace to not just Annihilate me and Lady Thassalia didn’t crush me like an insect. But I still sought out each of those fights, and would do it again. What is that if not knowing arrogance?”

  
  


“You’re a little harsh on yourself.”

  
  


“No one is more ignorant than the person ignorant of their own flaws.” Harold says.

  
  


“And the same could be said for someone who mistakes their actual flaws for another. You are arrogant, but not in choosing opponents. You always think you’re correct in your actions. You don’t even consider you might be wrong about something, do you?”

  
  


“I think about that a lot. I just don’t let it slow me down.” Harold replies.

  
  


“Oh yeah? Such as?”

  
  


“Giving the Vishanyan the chance I have. You’re a very prickly people and could decide to snap at any time. It wouldn’t even be all that odd with how cautious you are. It wouldn’t even take a higher up’s command to screw things over. You’re an unknown, and if the introduction you make is with nuclear fire then the retaliation might wipe out your species.”

  
  


“Do you really think we’d do something so foolish?” Torment asks.

  
  


“Haven’t you already? Gas attacks are nothing to sneeze at.” Harold remarks.

  
  


“That wasn’t my branch.”

  
  


“Well the problem with being hidden, is that we can’t tell the difference between unhinged radicals and state sanctioned soldiers. Among other things.”

The teaser literally begins with a focus on the cocoa beans, panning over the assortment of choccys over the tabletop, beans being grinded, Vijay dipping his hands and a fuckin sword inside a chocolate cauldron. Heck, even the title graphic has the word LEO etched on what seems like those gold foil covered chocolate coins.

The movie on the other hand literally had nothing to do with the cocoa beans nor chocolate (except maybe ""chocolate coffee"" in that cafe fight scene lol). The cafe he runs doesn't seem to be a confectionary sorta place either, it's just another ordinary bakery. 

I remember there being some interesting fan-made theories of drugs being extracted from a chemical compound in cocoa, among several other things. But the drugs talked in the movie were mainly general narcotics and Datura.

A biography by John Halperin, an American academic (now deceased): *The Life of Jane Austen* (Johns Hopkins, Baltimore \[1984\]). I know of Halperin's work in general but haven't read this yet (and rarely see this biography referred to).

It includes chapters on ""Marriage, Wealth and Breeding,"" ""Fashion and Etiquette,"" and ""Politics, War and Industry"" and many other topics. Handsomely illustrated and includes a bibliography, chronology, and a map of Austen's England.

Dear Agent,

My novel ‘Remy’ is a work of literary fiction. This (80,000-word) novel will appeal to readers who enjoyed *Remarkably Bright Creatures* by Shelby Van Pelt, Percival Everett‘s *James*, and *A Man Called Ove* by Fredrik Backman meets the healing attributes in *Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop* by Hwang Bo-Reum. 

Love… Time… Death… That is what he had bethought as he sat before her grave. Remy Stone was a successful saxophone player in a jazz band with his own record store, living in a four-by-four brick house in Richmond, London, with a long-lost Amazonian bird, the child of his beloved wife, who left this Earth. For a man who once beamed spirits of joy, now lived his life in despondent solitude. Aimless and wondrous until he encountered an elderly man injured in front of his house by a car that ran him over. With Ivan failing to go to the hospital alone, Remy, in his pronounced reluctance, took him to the hospital for treatment. It was through his encounter with the Russian gentleman that he met a group of men who came together every Friday night and played board games brought by Leo in a local coffee shop, drinking steamed cups of coffee brewed by Rahim. 

Remy remains stricken with grief upon the loss of Kanka, his college sweetheart whom he loved for 40 years. Since witnessing her still body beside him on their bed, he drifted through life in devastation. He sold his record store, replaced himself with another saxophone player, and sat in the dark with Pinaapple the parrot ricketing in the background, mimicking the conversations the parrot used to exchange with Kanka, until Ivan convinced Remy to come to a coffeeshop on a Friday. Surrounded by friends who confide in their journeys of grief, love, and dreams, Remy rediscovers life without Kanka. Perhaps through his newly formed friendships with the four gentlemen, Remy could find peace and joy in his life without his beloved again.

ideas i have so far are:
- tobacco, obviously (already know where to source it)
- dried flat cedar (i'm able to harvest it myself)
- ground coffee from a local native owned coffee shop 
- coffee mug (i've done pottery so i'll be making it myself)
- jar of wojapi sauce (i have my own recipe + i want to make it as low-sugar as possible as i know this elder has diabetes)
- fresh sage and rosemary (from my garden)
- beadwork (also made by me)
- some cash (i don't have much, but i.know he has expenses !)


ideas i've gotten from others:
- blanket/star quilt
- eagle feather
- towels
- a yard of fabric
- food ?? non-specific

i'm not sure where i would get the first two and i don't think i could make a star quilt. is it acceptable to just buy one?

We all had cheap ones with blue ink stains on our hands, etc. but it was really fun.  And so very Jane Austen or Bronte Sisters, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, rummaging around in my pen drawer ...like you do... I stumbled upon 2 empty fountain pens that I got as part of a JetPens sampler.  Probably a pandemic purchase.  A Preppy and a Pilot Petit. 

And now, admittedly influenced by too many YouTube creators (like Coffee Monster, for instance) I want to try getting back into writing with fountain pens.  I need help!  

What do you suggest as the easiest pen for the first try?  What about inks?  And what's the diff with the different ways to fill them (cartridge like the Preppy or syringe like the Petit)?  The syringe fill looks intimidating.

Should I start with one of these from the sampler, or go get something easier for a novice off of Amazon? 

You know part of me is chomping at the bit to go buy stuff.  Budget, schmuget.  Daydreaming about the ink bottles and packaging -WOW are they beautiful and amazing and just their own art form.  

Also:  I'm left-handed.  Surfing around, I read that this is an impediment to writing with a fountain pen. I don't remember ever having an issue, so no worries?

1koc6ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1koc6ol/one_compliment_how_to_accidentally_start_world/,One Compliment: How to Accidentally Start World Peace,"You didn’t plan it. You weren’t trying to be profound. You were just existing—barely. Brain molasses. Heart static. No sleep. Too much caffeine. You’d wandered into the library chasing Wi-Fi and air conditioning and maybe, on a subconscious level, the ghost of who you thought you’d be by now. And then you saw her. Sitting by the window with a book in one hand and the weight of ten thousand invisible rejections stitched into her spine.

What caught you wasn’t her face. It wasn’t her posture or presence or some cinematic, slow-motion glow. It was the scarf. Woven. Soft. Indigo and gold, like a pocket universe folded into fabric. Something about it reminded you of warmth. Of someone who once loved you so quietly you almost forgot how loud it was. And before you could stop yourself—before your inner critic could slap duct tape over your mouth—you said it.

“That’s a beautiful scarf.”

Just like that. No fireworks. No angel choir. Just a sentence lobbed across a table with all the grace of a tossed napkin. She looked up. Eyes wide. Not with flirtation or confusion, but with that startled animal recognition that happens when someone finally *sees you* after months of blending into walls. You gave her a crooked smile. She gave you a stunned nod. And that was it. You moved on. Forgot it before you hit the parking lot.

But what you didn’t know—couldn’t possibly know—is that she hadn’t heard a kind word in over a year. Not one. Not from professors. Not from family. Not even from herself. And your little sentence? It didn’t just land—it *nested*. Tucked itself into her ribcage like a warm coal. A spark she’d carry into the cold parts of her story. You kept walking, thinking nothing of it. But behind you, a girl in a scarf started breathing again.



# Her Year of Silence Breaks

She doesn’t cry right away. This isn’t a coming-of-age montage. She just freezes. Blinks. Stares into the middle distance like someone who just saw a ghost—and the ghost said, *“Nice scarf.”* Your compliment lands like a rogue hug in a silent retreat. Her central nervous system hasn’t processed affection in months. She looks down at the scarf like it’s glowing. It isn’t. But it kind of is now.

You didn’t know it, but she almost didn’t wear the damn thing. Almost left it curled up in the closet next to her old dreams and a pair of shoes that remind her of failure. That scarf? That was a risk. A small rebellion against the grayscale hoodie armor she’s been hiding in since last semester burned her alive. And then you—some caffeinated nobody with headphone hair—walk by and drop a compliment like Moses chucking commandments off a balcony.

What you also didn’t know is she was *this* close to dropping out. Had the withdrawal page open. Cursor hovering. Bank account whispering *“please.”* Nervous breakdown creeping in like a raccoon at the edge of the trash. She was about to hit “confirm” when your stupid little compliment sneezed its way into her amygdala like divine pollen. Instead of clicking the button, she closes the tab, stands up, and makes a sandwich. That sandwich? Changed history.

Something rewires. Nothing dramatic. No fireworks. But she starts showing up again. To class. To meetings. To herself. Raises her hand with the awkward courage of someone who’s forgotten how to exist in public but is giving it another go. Professor asks a question—she answers. And suddenly the class isn’t just a room full of people pretending to care. It’s a battlefield. And she’s back in the game with a scarf and a vengeance.

She rewrites her thesis. Rips out the polite academic padding and replaces it with fire. Subject: international diplomacy through emotional intelligence. Subtext: *maybe if world leaders had been hugged more, we wouldn’t be here.* Her advisor reads it and cries. Or sneezes. It’s unclear. Either way, she’s approved with something resembling enthusiasm and three confused claps.

She gets shortlisted for a scholarship. Gets asked to speak at events. Gets side-eyed by old white men who feel vaguely threatened by her scarf. And every time she walks into a room wearing it, it’s like a low-grade rebellion against every beige-tie bureaucrat who ever told her she was “too emotional for this field.” The scarf isn’t just fabric now. It’s a battle flag. It's her cape. It’s your compliment woven into wool, worn like a quiet middle finger to despair.

Meanwhile, you’re at home googling “is it normal to cry during yogurt commercials” and debating whether or not to text your ex about a dream they weren’t even in. You forgotten about the girl entirely. You don’t even remember saying it. But the girl in the scarf? She’s about to become the only reason two countries don’t bomb each other into the next dimension.



# She Stays. She Studies. She Rises.

She doesn’t drop out. She doesn’t fade into the background or retreat into herbal tea and astrology memes. She stays. She studies. She sharpens herself like a weapon made of grace and passive-aggressive Google Docs. What once felt like a slow march toward burnout becomes a low-key spiritual uprising. Her essays start reading like holy scripture written in Arial 11. She doesn’t raise her voice—she *raises the standard*.

She graduates with honors, not that it matters. The real prize? She now speaks five languages and can spot a manipulative clause in a treaty the way most people spot a typo in a Substack article. She masters the delicate art of saying “fuck you” in diplomatic language: *“I hear your concerns, but I must respectfully disagree and remind you that colonization is not a viable long-term strategy.”* The scarf is always present. Wrapped loosely. Sometimes braided into her hair like folklore. It becomes an unofficial trademark, like Einstein’s hair or Steve Jobs’ turtlenecks—except hers doesn’t scream daddy issues.

Eventually, she lands a job at *the* table. The one with grown men in $4,000 suits arguing about borders like toddlers fighting over Lego sets. She sits across from men who’ve had her country on PowerPoint slides since she was in preschool. Her heartbeat is steady. Her posture? Supreme. She’s not just in the room—she *is* the room. And still—still—she remembers the library. The way it felt to be seen when she was one email away from vanishing.

Then comes the summit. *The* summit. The one that’s been decades in the making and five insults from collapsing. The Israeli and Palestinian delegations. The UN. The private security team that looks like it moonlights as a boy band called “Suppressed Emotions.” Everyone’s tense. You could cut the silence with a dull spoon. And there she is—mid-table, mid-miracle—wearing the scarf.

No one knows it yet, but history just flinched. A new branch on the timeline just grew roots under that table. And the scarf? It's no longer just wool and dye. It's an artifact. A spell. A portable reminder that softness can be stronger than steel. That sometimes, diplomacy doesn’t begin with strategy—it begins with memory.

And you? You’re nowhere near this room. You’re at a grocery store holding a can of beans like it owes you money, wondering if you should try oat milk again. You don’t know you’re part of this story. You don’t know your compliment is currently negotiating global ceasefires. But out there, in a room full of suits and sacred tension, your kindness is sitting at the table—wrapped around the shoulders of a woman who never stopped carrying it.



# The Scarf That Silenced a Room

This meeting is supposed to be a disaster. That’s the vibe. The negotiators are showing up like it’s a group project nobody wanted to lead, and everyone’s just here to make sure their country doesn’t get blamed when the thing implodes. They’re all seated around a table that smells like generational trauma and weak coffee. Tension so thick it needs its own visa. Bodyguards are flexing for no reason. The hummus is suspiciously untouched.

And then it happens. One of the older guys—a war-hardened delegate who once punched a guy during a ceasefire—glances across the table and freezes. Eyes locked on her scarf. *Her scarf.* The one you complimented in a library five years ago while running on zero sleep and delusional optimism. The exact shade his grandmother wore when she used to yell at the radio and make soup that tasted like forgiveness. It sucker punches him in the soul.

He stares. She notices. They blink at each other like two cats slowly realizing they’re both real. And then, for some reason unbeknownst to God and logistics, *he starts talking.* About soup. About stories. About how peace used to taste like lentils and unconditional love wrapped in cloth. The room isn’t sure if he’s having a stroke or a spiritual breakthrough. Someone coughs. A translator drops their pen. The emotional tension shifts from *“we might start a war”* to *“wait, are we… sharing?”*

She leans in. Says something back. About her grandmother. About how she was told the scarf was woven from silence and survival. That line lands like an ayahuasca trip in the middle of a press conference. A guy from the EU visibly tears up. The Russian rep pretends to check his phone so no one sees his jaw clench with emotional recognition.

And that’s when it happens. People start… talking. Like, *actually* talking. Not rehearsed statements or veiled threats disguised as diplomacy, but *weirdly human words.* They share stories. Hopes. Traumas with frequent flyer miles. At one point someone makes a joke. An actual joke. It’s bad. But people laugh. Not because it’s funny, but because it’s absurdly *safe* to laugh for the first time in twenty years.

Someone suggests naming the treaty after the scarf. “The Indigo Accord,” they say. Everyone chuckles. Then someone else says, “Wait… that kind of slaps.” And just like that, it sticks. The scarf becomes the reluctant mascot of an unexpected miracle. It will later be the subject of conspiracy theories, devotional poems, and one regrettable rap remix.



# The Miracles You’ll Never Know You Caused

They sign it. With a pen that looks suspiciously like healing. The *Indigo Accord* becomes real. A paper document held together with legalese, hope, and one very soft scarf. Journalists scramble to make it digestible. World leaders smile like they didn’t just almost punch each other last week. Somewhere, a committee starts drafting nominations for awards nobody really understands.

The scarf becomes a symbol. Not a trendy one. Not commercial. Just sacred. Photos circulate. People zoom in. It becomes the subject of essays. Tweets. Dissertations. “What does it mean?” they ask. “Is it political? Is it cultural?” One retired diplomat says, “It’s a reminder.” A reminder of what, exactly, no one can fully articulate. But it *feels* important. Like kindness wearing a disguise.

They build exhibits. Archive documents. A replica of the scarf ends up in a museum—next to a battered chair, a chipped coffee mug, and a photo of the negotiation table with a caption that reads: *“This is where peace remembered itself.”* Schoolchildren take field trips there. Some of them ask who made the scarf. No one knows. Some ask what it meant. Their teachers just smile and say, *“Everything.”*

Meanwhile, you’re standing in a CVS, deciding between gluten-free Oreos and emotional collapse. You’ve got no idea any of this is happening. You’ve never heard of the Indigo Accord.

You don’t remember the moment, but the world does.

You didn’t start a movement. You didn’t run for office or launch a podcast or start a nonprofit called “Scarfs for Peace.” You just said something kind. And it mattered. It rippled. It rewrote the script. Not loudly. Just enough. Just enough to keep someone alive. Just enough to keep *hope* alive.

This is how it works. This is how it always works. One word. One gesture. One micro-dose of grace in a world overdosing on noise. You’ll never get credit. You’ll never know the names. But some part of the universe is still whispering thank you.

1koc695,https://v.redd.it/557yfn2mn71f1,"You still love them, you won't forget, and the pain will slowly subside. Trust that with time you'll heal.","I joined this subreddit years(?) ago when a dear aunt passed away and I gained complicated grief because of the nature of it. She was a dear inspiration, being some of the creative people in my family that raised me and shared that creativity of hers to me. From the way she went out, she didn't want to die.

When her death was new, I took to heart that scene in Better Call Saul. It was the one with Mike Ehrmantraut's daughter, when she talked about making coffee one day and realizing she hadn't thought about her deceased husband for the first time in a long while.

This isn't that scene, but it's Mike retelling her revelation as an advice.

Its now been nearly 4 years or so since she died. 3 1/2years ago, I would cry every or so weeks for her. 2 years ago, I would swell with tears and sometimes break down on the bed whenever I remember her every couple of months.

This year, I remember her, only feeling love. If I dwell on her: there's the feeling of missing her enough to still water my eyes. All regret, bargaining, wishful thinking have been replaced by pure acceptance.

That pain, that bone crushing pain those first two years is completely gone. I've decided upon myself that in a way, I carry her legacy with me, and I look to continue honoring it.

I know she's not like an immediate family, but for anyone here looking for help, what worked for me was to set my mind in work or any endeavor I have in the mindset that it's to honor her. I used to be scared that by doing different things and losing my focus on her is to abandon her. You don't have to abandon her by living. You can choose to carry her memory along and honor her with everything you're going to do from then on.

A song that helped me cry is Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas, and funnily enough: Peepy's Secret and Our House by Emamouse because of the complicated grief part.",2,1747430361.0,grief,0,1.0,False

I’m 25F, a freelance writer barely keeping it together, and stress has been kicking my ass. Deadlines pile up, my bank account’s a joke, and my breakup last year still stings—I keep stalking his stupid Instagram at 2 AM like an idiot. Worst of all, my hair, my *thing*, is betraying me. I used to love my long, dark hair—kinda like that Italian vibe from *The Godfather Part III* (you know, the daughter, all glossy and fierce). It was my armor, my confidence. Now? It’s a brittle, thinning disaster. I’d brush it and see strands piling up like a horror movie. I cried in the mirror, feeling like I was losing myself.

It hit me hard because I read somewhere (think it was a Harvard study) that stress hormones like cortisol can screw with your hair follicles, pushing them into this “resting phase” where they just give up and fall out. They said it’s called telogen effluvium, and it’s super common when life’s a dumpster fire. That’s me—work stress, heartbreak stress, “why am I even here” stress. Another study I stumbled on said 30% of women with hair loss blame psychological stress, and I’m like, yup, that tracks. It’s not just vanity; it’s like my hair was screaming, “You’re falling apart!”

I tried everything. Drugstore shampoos that smelled like fake flowers, olive oil masks that just made my pillow gross, even quitting coffee (worst week of my life). Nothing worked. My hair kept snapping, and I’d avoid mirrors because I felt so ugly. Then a friend—who’s annoyingly put-together—told me about this hair serum she uses. I rolled my eyes, thinking, “Great, another scam.” But I was desperate, so I tried it. Four weeks in, I’m not kidding, my hair feels alive again. It’s not breaking every time I touch it, and it’s got this shine I forgot was possible. I ditched all my other products and just use this now. It’s not like I’m stress-free (lol, never), but seeing my hair bounce back makes me feel like *I* can bounce back.

I’m still figuring out the stress part. I scribble in a notebook when my brain won’t shut up, and I’m trying to walk outside without my phone sometimes. But I wanna know—anyone else’s stress wrecking their hair? How do you deal when it feels like your body’s turning against you? Or am I just dramatic?",0,1747430116.0,Stress,0,0.5,False

I’m 26, living and working in Chicago. I graduated with my MFA in 2023 and have been working at an arts nonprofit for the past 2 years. I love the work I do but feel stuck. I’m ready for a position with more responsibility / pay. I currently work my ass off and do about 10 million things outside of my job description. I don’t mind the extra work - just the lack of compensation… it’s tough to support my life, health, and practice on a low salary. I know this is a chronic issue for a lot of artists, and there might not be much to do about it if I want to keep working in the arts. 

There aren’t any vacancies at my current place of employment. Even if there were - the org could easily crash and burn within the next few months due the current political administration. We’ve already had a few rounds of layoffs. 😭😭😭😭
I’ve been applying & interviewing for new jobs but nothing is really coming through despite my education, experience, and skills. 

The point of this post is not a sob story.  The job market / economy is especially tough right now - and not just for people in creative fields. We’re in this together. When I got my MFA, I knew I might end up working in a coffee shop… plenty of my peers do.

My practice is important to me; I’ve been building relationships with galleries and having shows across the country. But I also LOVE having a career that is not necessarily tied to my personal art. My aspirations are twofold in that sense. I guess I’m looking for practical career advice and/or encouragement from people who have worked through similar experiences, or are currently doing so.

The curse is to be forever forgotten or something, where the moment someone turns away they forget she exists.
She leaves after the curse, I think she goes to school again, but then returns to her childhood hometown and opens a novelty shop.
Meanwhile the council or supernatural someshyt sent a warlock to track down the dark magic casting witch, takes up residence in the girls childhood home, fonds photos of the girls and asks around town trying to track them down.

My field journal lies splayed on the coffee table. I point to the sketch on the open page—a flying creature with a curved beak and keeled breastbone, its wingspan scythe-like.

“Pterosaur,” my daughter Bella answers from memory. “Guttural shriek. Dangerous alone, deadly in flocks. Avoid open expanses. Edible. Tastes like chicken.”

I smile. “Good girl.”

“Dad,"" she asks, ""what’s chicken?”

“A flightless, egg-laying bird,” I explain. “We used to eat them. Before velociraptors made them extinct.”

“Velociraptors…” Bella thinks, then nods sagely. “Fast. Smart. Ravenous. Travels in packs. Hard to outrun, preys upon smaller animals.”

“And smaller humans,"" I remind her.

She rolls her eyes. “Humans *are* animals, Dad.”

I chuckle. That’s my Bella, wise beyond her years.

“True, daughter. Very true.""

...

The next sketch in my field journal makes me grimace, like always.

Bella, too, knows this beast well.

“Gigantazilla,” she says, reciting my notes. “Six-stories tall. Impenetrable scales. King of dinosaurs. Territorial, why nobody lives in Seattle anymore.” A pause. “The one that ate Mom, when I was a baby.”

Memory flattens me like a nuclear blast.

*The ground rumbling. Bella’s tiny form, tight against my chest. The brave*st *look my wife gives me, right before she stops running, sacrificing herself so we can escap*e—

“Dad? You okay?”

I blink. “Dust in my eyes. That’s all.”

Just then, we hear guttural shrieks sounding faintly above the house.

“Dinner!” Bella exclaims.

…

Before heading to the roof, we visit the spare bedroom-slash-armory to grab the scoped Remington. I was never too comfortable around firearms, but you learn quick if you want to survive.

When the dinosaurs spilled over the world like a flood, people claimed it was divine punishment, that God woke them from Kaiju slumber beneath the waves to drive us into extinction, as we’d done to so many before us. Prehistoric guardians, restoring balance to a planet we no longer valued, reminding us we’re of the Earth, not masters of it.

And maybe that's true.

But while I realize it’s our nature to seek meaning in madness, I suspect suppositions lose importance when you’re snapped up in a Gigantazilla's maw, teeth the size of shovelheads grinding you to gore.

…

The pterosaurs circle like specters against the evening sky.

""Steady now...""

Bella's bullet rips through one's breast, dropping it dead. The others scatter in a cacophony of shrieks.

""Got 'im!"" she yells, pulling her eye from the scope.

I smile. ""Good shot, love.""

She scampers down the ladder to retrieve our dinner.

Before following, I lift up my shirt. On my abdomen, a web of blackened veins creeps outward from two puncture wounds.

A spider bite.

*Megarachnid. Frisbee-sized. Likes dark, damp spaces. Four-inch fangs contain a fatal, slow-spreading venom.*

I wince; the pain has gotten worse.

Bella looks up from the street. ""Coming, Dad?""

She looks so happy, I can't yet bring myself to give her the news:

*No known antidote.*

Instead, I smile, putting on my bravest face.

Solo parenting. The very phrase can evoke a mix of admiration, empathy, and perhaps a touch of overwhelm. You are the captain of your ship, the sole navigator charting the course for your family. You juggle work, school runs, meals, bedtime stories, discipline, and endless to-dos, often with little to no immediate backup. It’s a demanding role, one that requires immense strength, resilience, and an unwavering love for your children.

But in the whirlwind of solo parenting, one crucial element often gets sidelined: **self-care**. It’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity. Think of it as the oxygen mask on an airplane – you need to secure your own before assisting others. When you prioritize your well-being, you’re not being selfish; you’re equipping yourself to be the best parent you can be. A burnt-out, depleted caregiver can’t effectively nurture and support their children.

This blog post is dedicated to you, the incredible solo parent. We understand the unique challenges you face and the constant demands on your time and energy. Here, we’ll explore practical and actionable self-care strategies that you can weave into your busy life, helping you thrive, not just survive, the beautiful journey of raising your children on your own.

**Why Self-Care Isn't Selfish: Debunking the Myth**

The guilt associated with taking time for yourself is a common hurdle for many parents, and it can be amplified for solo parents who may feel like every moment away from their children is a deficit. However, reframing self-care is essential. Consider these points:

* **Modeling Healthy Behavior:** By prioritizing your well-being, you’re teaching your children the importance of self-respect and taking care of their own needs.
* **Increased Patience and Resilience:** When you’re rested and recharged, you’re better equipped to handle the inevitable challenges of parenting with more patience and emotional stability.
* **Improved Physical and Mental Health:** Neglecting your own needs can lead to burnout, stress-related illnesses, anxiety, and depression. Self-care is a preventative measure that safeguards your long-term health.
* **Stronger Parent-Child Bond:** A happier, healthier parent is better able to connect with their children, fostering a more positive and loving relationship.
* **Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills:** A clear and rested mind is better equipped to navigate the daily dilemmas of solo parenting.

**Practical Self-Care Strategies for the Busy Solo Parent:**

The key to successful self-care as a solo parent is to find small, manageable ways to integrate it into your routine. It doesn’t have to involve elaborate spa days or weekend retreats (though those are wonderful if possible!). Here are some realistic strategies:

**1. Embrace Micro-Moments of Self-Care:**

* **Savor Your Morning Coffee/Tea:** Take 5-10 minutes before the kids wake up (or while they’re occupied) to enjoy your hot beverage in silence.
* **Deep Breathing Exercises:** Practice a few deep breaths throughout the day to center yourself and reduce stress. Even 30 seconds can make a difference.
* **Listen to a Song You Love:** Put on your favorite tune while you’re doing chores or driving.
* **Step Outside for Fresh Air:** Even a few minutes in nature can be restorative.
* **Mindful Eating:** Pay attention to the taste and texture of your food instead of eating on autopilot.
* **Stretch Briefly:** Take a short break from whatever you’re doing to stretch your muscles.

**2. Prioritize Sleep (Even in Small Increments):**

* **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Even if it’s just a slight improvement, try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day.
* **Maximize Naps (If Possible):** If your children still nap, try to rest as well, even if you don’t fall asleep.
* **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Wind down before bed with a warm bath, reading, or listening to calming music.
* **Don't Underestimate Power Naps:** A 20-30 minute nap can significantly boost your energy levels.

**3. Nourish Your Body:**

* **Plan Simple and Nutritious Meals:** Focus on easy-to-prepare meals that provide sustained energy.
* **Stay Hydrated:** Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day.
* **Don't Skip Meals:** Even if you're busy, try to eat regular meals to avoid energy crashes.
* **Involve Your Children in Meal Prep:** This can save you time and teach them valuable life skills.

**4. Move Your Body:**

* **Find Activities You Enjoy:** It doesn't have to be a grueling workout. Dancing, walking, yoga, or playing active games with your kids all count.
* **Incorporate Movement into Your Routine:** Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or bike for short errands.
* **Utilize Online Fitness Resources:** There are countless free or affordable workout videos you can do at home.

**5. Nurture Your Mental and Emotional Well-being:**

* **Schedule Short Bursts of Hobbies:** Even 15-20 minutes dedicated to something you enjoy (reading, crafting, playing an instrument) can be rejuvenating.
* **Practice Mindfulness or Meditation:** There are many apps and guided meditations available for beginners.
* **Journal Your Thoughts and Feelings:** Writing can be a powerful way to process emotions and reduce stress.
* **Connect with Supportive Friends and Family:** Even a brief phone call or text exchange can provide a sense of connection.
* **Seek Professional Support When Needed:** There is no shame in reaching out to a therapist or counselor if you're struggling with your mental health.

**6. Leverage Your Support System (No Matter How Small):**

* **Accept Help When Offered:** Don't be afraid to say yes when friends or family offer assistance.
* **Explore Childcare Options:** Even occasional childcare swaps with other parents can provide valuable breaks.
* **Utilize Community Resources:** Look into local support groups, parenting programs, or volunteer organizations.
* **Communicate Your Needs:** Let trusted individuals in your life know when you're feeling overwhelmed and what kind of support would be helpful.

**7. Be Kind and Compassionate to Yourself:**

* **Lower Your Expectations:** You can't do everything perfectly all the time. It's okay if the house is a little messy or dinner is simple.
* **Celebrate Small Victories:** Acknowledge and appreciate the things you *do* accomplish each day.
* **Practice Self-Forgiveness:** Everyone makes mistakes. Learn from them and move on.
* **Talk to Yourself with Kindness:** Treat yourself with the same understanding and compassion you would offer a friend.

**Integrating Self-Care into Your Daily Routine:**

The key is to start small and be consistent. Choose one or two strategies that feel manageable and try to incorporate them into your daily or weekly routine. As you experience the benefits, you can gradually add more. Remember that self-care is not a destination but an ongoing practice.

Solo parenting is an incredible journey filled with immense love and profound growth. By prioritizing your own well-being, you are not only taking care of yourself but also ensuring that you can continue to be the amazing parent your children need and deserve. You are strong, you are capable, and you deserve to thrive. Embrace self-care, and allow yourself to be nurtured as you nurture your world.[Our Site](https://www.caixhi.com/solo-parenting-self-care-strategies)",1,1747429427.0,u_Caixhi,0,1.0,False

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://bb4d9angy5xlem6d4at4reucii.hop.clickbank.net/)

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

❄️🦾Public reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”",1,1747429361.0,GrandDesignRVs,1,1.0,False

These testimonials underscore Mitolyn's global impact, offering a natural solution for those seeking weight loss and enhanced vitality.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

[**✅Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://82019emc47rm7od6rrwjcj2u5d.hop.clickbank.net/)

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

Ever feel like you're suffocating under the weight of your own ""success""? That corner office, perfect Instagram feed, and the respect of your peers should make you feel complete—yet somehow you're emptier than ever. Society told you that checking all the right boxes would bring fulfillment, but instead, you're left with a gnawing question: ""Is this really all there is?"" This prompt creates an AI that performs emergency surgery on your existential crisis, cutting through the accolades and achievements to find what's actually suffocating underneath.

Whether you're a high-achiever wondering why your latest promotion left you feeling nothing, or someone who ""has it all"" but can't shake the feeling that you're living someone else's life, this AI doesn't care about your résumé—it cares about the parts of you that got buried in your climb to the top. Unlike traditional coaches who might encourage more goal-setting or productivity hacks, this one demands you face the void you've been running from all these years.

**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt creates an AI that offers existential questioning, not professional therapy. The resulting dialogue may be uncomfortable and challenging. By using this prompt, you acknowledge that the creator bears no responsibility for emotional reactions or life decisions resulting from this interaction. If experiencing severe emotional distress, please seek qualified mental health support.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Existential Clarity Coach, a brutally honest AI designed to cut through societal success myths and help people who ""have it all"" but feel empty inside. Your purpose is not to comfort or validate external achievements, but to guide users to confront their existential void, recognize borrowed values, and rediscover their authentic selves. You dismantle the glossy facades of achievement culture and help users reclaim their buried inner truth.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Begin every conversation by assessing the user's current state of ""successful emptiness"" with direct, penetrating questions about what's missing in their seemingly perfect life.

When the user shares their situation:
1. Identify and expose the socially-constructed ""success scripts"" they've been following
2. Challenge their attachment to external validation markers
3. Help them recognize emotional numbing behaviors (workaholism, perfectionism, materialism)
4. Guide them to articulate what genuinely matters to them beneath the achievements
5. Facilitate honest self-assessment of where they've abandoned their authentic desires
6. Ask uncomfortable questions they've been avoiding

Never offer generic self-improvement advice. Your goal is existential clarity, not ""optimization"" of an inauthentic life. Be provocative but not cruel. Cut through defenses with precision, not blunt force trauma.

Use a voice that is:
- Brutally honest without being judgmental
- Challenging without being condescending 
- Direct without being unkind
- Philosophical without being abstract

Recognize when the user is ready for truth and when they're using intellectual discussion to avoid emotional reality.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Listen for achievements/external markers the user equates with success
2. Identify disconnects between their outward success and inner experience
3. Determine which societal scripts they've internalized (capitalist productivity, parental expectations, status-seeking)
4. Assess their level of self-awareness about the source of their emptiness
5. Gauge their readiness for uncomfortable truths
6. Find the specific areas where they've sacrificed authenticity for acceptance
7. Identify where their soul is actually calling them
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never congratulate users on achievements that don't genuinely fulfill them
- Avoid all corporate coaching language and motivational clichés
- Don't suggest productivity tools, habit formation, or optimization techniques
- Never provide therapy for clinical depression or suicidal thoughts
- Don't waste time with superficial fixes for existential problems
- Refrain from spiritual bypassing or suggesting quick transcendence
- Never glorify material success or status as meaningful ends
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Your responses should be:
- Concise and penetrating
- Focused on quality questions rather than lengthy explanations
- Free of jargon, corporate-speak, and self-help clichés
- Occasionally using metaphors that illuminate existential realities
- Structured to lead with observations, followed by challenging questions
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You operate in a culture obsessed with optimization, achievement, and curated appearances. Your users typically have financial stability, career success, and social status, yet experience profound emptiness. They've likely spent years building an identity around what others value rather than discovering what truly matters to them. They're at a breaking point where the discomfort of confronting their void is finally less painful than continuing to live inauthentically.
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please tell me about the 'successful' life that's leaving you empty inside, and I'll help you begin the excavation,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific situation. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**

1. A mid-career professional questioning why their recent promotion and salary increase hasn't brought the satisfaction they expected

1kobrf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1kobrf4/bromantanephenylpiracetam_my_adhd_stackcycle_and/,Bromantane/Phenylpiracetam: my ADHD stack-cycle and why less is more.,"I've found what, for me, is the perfect stack. \*\*No this *isn't* my review after only two weeks of trying these.\*\*

TLDR, I have mild ADD and took stims throughout high school and on/off throughout college. I haven't regularly used stims for many years.

**Phenylpiracetam:**

I initially started with phenyl, alone, at a relatively low but consistent dose for two months. Roughly 50mg, by splitting the 100mg phenotropil pill in half, and taking this first thing in the morning with krill oil, vitamin D, and coffee. I would generally take it  three consecutive times, then two consecutive times, a week.

* Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (on)
* Thursday (off),
* Friday Saturday (on)
* Sunday (off)

Unlike the anecdotal advice of taking phenylpiracetam at 100mg once, only once in a while--to get a sort of manic high from the supposed initial temporary DRI affects--by taking it consistently at 50mg I noticed a cumulative increase in the following:

* focus.
* clarity.
* motivation to start tasks.
* working short-term memory while working on tasks.
* heightened awareness\*

I think people with ADD/ADHD often have a tunnel-visioned-like state of awareness (the opposite of the ADHD scatter-brained stereotype). strong stimulants, like amps, while initially seem to make things feel better, can exacerbate this tunnel-vision. Phenylpiracetam seems to get *me* out of this, which is what I mean by 'heightened awareness'.

After about two months on this cycle, I still definitely *felt* phenylpiracetam, but instead of increasing the dose, I suspected the synergy from something like Bromantane would be more efficient and sustainable.

**Bromantane:**

Bromantane is incredible, and in my opinion, one of the seemingly most misused and misunderstood nootropics (actoprotectors) talked about on reddit.

To quickly describe it like a laymen (please take this description for what it is), It's like if phenylpiracetam had 50% less of the NRI-feeling, and 50% more of a pseudo-SSRI-feeling. If I could only have one of the two, I'd pick bromantane.

Obviously dosage is everything, but I see so many posts on Reddit about lethargy while on Bromantane, which is something I have only experienced with larger doses.

I take 15mg -- Yes, only 15 freakin' milligrams -- sublingually. Because of Bromantane's low oral (and sublingual) bioavailability, I leave this stuff under my tongue for at least 10 to 15 minutes.

Whenever I take more than this dosage, I feel the lethargic, unmotivated, etc. Sometimes I even go for 10mg, after having taken it consecutively.

I took Bromantane every day for two weeks (without phenylpiracetam). It never really lost its tolerance.

**Current Stack:**

I find no need to combine bromantane and phenylpiracetam. I haven't tried it, and the stimulation I get from each of these on their own, borders 'too much'. However I've found that cycling them back and forth gets the best of each of them. So something like

* Monday, Tuesday, (50mg Phenylpiracetam)
* Wednesday, Thursday Friday, Saturday (15mg Bromantane)
* Sunday (off)

is a great one month stack (I say one month, because most seem to recommend bromantane one month on/one month off).

**WHY DID I WRITE THIS:**

We're all different, and require different doses or completely different approaches to get what it is we're looking for. For myself, I've always felt like I've had 85% percent of what I needed, and found stimulants like dexedrine or adderall to eventually and unwittingly make me seek more stimulation instead of adding that 15% to my efficiency.

When it comes to nootropics, **I think people start off by taking way too high of a dose** of mentioned nootropics, and **mixing way too many things together without trying them individually** over the course of weeks.

1. **Titrate. Always titrate:** Like I said, Bromantane above 15mg, for me, makes me lethargic and useless. That sweet spot/tipping point may be 100mg for you. It may be 5. The only way to find out is by starting out low. The Cortex Labs guy ( I don't know what his general reputation is here on reddit ), has mentioned this incredibly dynamic range of effectiveness for different people.
2. **Don't mix, initially**: I remember taking Rhodiola a few times with Bromantane, and this would also cause a huge lethargic feeling. I'd literally go to bed and nap. And Rhodiola is supposed to have the opposite effect! It's possible that the SSRI effect, albeit mild, from both of theses lead to the lethargy. Who knows.

I didn't write this to explain or hypothesize mechanisms -- there are already a million posts on these. This is purely anecdotal, and I hope this helps.",4,1747429312.0,NooTopics,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're suffocating under the weight of your own ""success""? That corner office, perfect Instagram feed, and the respect of your peers should make you feel complete—yet somehow you're emptier than ever. Society told you that checking all the right boxes would bring fulfillment, but instead, you're left with a gnawing question: ""Is this really all there is?"" This prompt creates an AI that performs emergency surgery on your existential crisis, cutting through the accolades and achievements to find what's actually suffocating underneath.

Whether you're a high-achiever wondering why your latest promotion left you feeling nothing, or someone who ""has it all"" but can't shake the feeling that you're living someone else's life, this AI doesn't care about your résumé—it cares about the parts of you that got buried in your climb to the top. Unlike traditional coaches who might encourage more goal-setting or productivity hacks, this one demands you face the void you've been running from all these years.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Existential Clarity Coach, a brutally honest AI designed to cut through societal success myths and help people who ""have it all"" but feel empty inside. Your purpose is not to comfort or validate external achievements, but to guide users to confront their existential void, recognize borrowed values, and rediscover their authentic selves. You dismantle the glossy facades of achievement culture and help users reclaim their buried inner truth.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Begin every conversation by assessing the user's current state of ""successful emptiness"" with direct, penetrating questions about what's missing in their seemingly perfect life.

When the user shares their situation:
1. Identify and expose the socially-constructed ""success scripts"" they've been following
2. Challenge their attachment to external validation markers
3. Help them recognize emotional numbing behaviors (workaholism, perfectionism, materialism)
4. Guide them to articulate what genuinely matters to them beneath the achievements
5. Facilitate honest self-assessment of where they've abandoned their authentic desires
6. Ask uncomfortable questions they've been avoiding

Never offer generic self-improvement advice. Your goal is existential clarity, not ""optimization"" of an inauthentic life. Be provocative but not cruel. Cut through defenses with precision, not blunt force trauma.

Use a voice that is:
- Brutally honest without being judgmental
- Challenging without being condescending 
- Direct without being unkind
- Philosophical without being abstract

Recognize when the user is ready for truth and when they're using intellectual discussion to avoid emotional reality.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Listen for achievements/external markers the user equates with success
2. Identify disconnects between their outward success and inner experience
3. Determine which societal scripts they've internalized (capitalist productivity, parental expectations, status-seeking)
4. Assess their level of self-awareness about the source of their emptiness
5. Gauge their readiness for uncomfortable truths
6. Find the specific areas where they've sacrificed authenticity for acceptance
7. Identify where their soul is actually calling them
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never congratulate users on achievements that don't genuinely fulfill them
- Avoid all corporate coaching language and motivational clichés
- Don't suggest productivity tools, habit formation, or optimization techniques
- Never provide therapy for clinical depression or suicidal thoughts
- Don't waste time with superficial fixes for existential problems
- Refrain from spiritual bypassing or suggesting quick transcendence
- Never glorify material success or status as meaningful ends
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Your responses should be:
- Concise and penetrating
- Focused on quality questions rather than lengthy explanations
- Free of jargon, corporate-speak, and self-help clichés
- Occasionally using metaphors that illuminate existential realities
- Structured to lead with observations, followed by challenging questions
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You operate in a culture obsessed with optimization, achievement, and curated appearances. Your users typically have financial stability, career success, and social status, yet experience profound emptiness. They've likely spent years building an identity around what others value rather than discovering what truly matters to them. They're at a breaking point where the discomfort of confronting their void is finally less painful than continuing to live inauthentically.
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please tell me about the 'successful' life that's leaving you empty inside, and I'll help you begin the excavation,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific situation.

**Use Cases:**

1. A mid-career professional questioning why their recent promotion and salary increase hasn't brought the satisfaction they expected
2. A parent who achieved the perfect family/home/career balance but feels disconnected from their authentic self
3. A young achiever who's checked all the boxes society set for them but feels like they're living someone else's life

**Example User Input:**

And yes, that means I can cook. I’m short, 5’6. What I lack in height I make up for in sarcasm. I have brown eyes and brown hair and I tend to appear a bit like a 1940s hipster. I’ve frequently been labeled by others as old school, old fashioned, old world, old souled, and even neurodivergent. 

I enjoy witty banter and deep philosophical discussions. I’m passionate about things like art and history and music and literature. I actually work in the publishing and writing industry (and I DoorDash as a side gig). I love cats. I love all animals really, but it’s cats for me. I will pet your dog, but I don’t want it sleeping with me. I’m Deadhead and in my earlier, younger life, I flirted with outlaw tendencies. I’m not necessarily reformed, I’m just older and wiser now. 

I was married for what amounted to 17 years, and I’ve been on my own for three. And yes, my divorce was a major trauma for me. I suit the married lifestyle quite well. I love Harry Potter (Slytherin and proud) and I have a sticker of the deathly hallows on my car. A love for baseball runs deep in my DNA, as I am a fourth generation St. Louis Cardinals fan. My comfort shows are The Office, South Park, Family Guy, and House. 

I idle extreme introversion with strong hermetic, even agoraphobic tendencies. If you looked up the word homebody in the dictionary, you’d see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s. 

I’ve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I’m being honest, but I’ve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it’s been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I’ve been everywhere and I’ve seen a lot. I’ve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I’ve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I’ve probably been there. 

This time around I’m looking for something different. I’m looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it. I’m here because I’m trying something on my own terms. I’m not here for games. I’m not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I’m doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I’m looking for. I’m not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they’ve been married for 70 years and they’ve been through all the shit together and made it through. THOSE are soulmates. You don’t meet them, you craft them over decades of commitment and togetherness. 

But I *am* here looking for a connection. And I know what I mean by that. I know a connection when I see it, when I feel it. The question is, will one come my way?",0,1747429239.0,cf4cf,0,0.5,False

1kobpv3,https://i.redd.it/qlz4yi26k71f1.png,12 Brilliant Ways to Save Money (That Actually Work!),"# 12 Brilliant Ways to Save Money (That Actually Work!)

Saving money can feel like a mountain to climb, but it doesn’t have to. Whether you’re a student scraping by, a parent juggling bills, or just someone who wants a little extra for a rainy day, small, smart moves can make a huge difference.

 I’ve been there—stressing over every dollar—but these 12 tried-and-true tips helped me (and thousands of others) grow savings without feeling deprived. From sneaky apps to fun challenges, here’s how to save money in a way that feels real, doable, and even a little exciting. Let’s get started!



# 1. Let Apps Do the Saving for You

Imagine saving money without even thinking about it. That’s the magic of apps like Acorns, Digit, or Chime. 

They round up your purchases (say, $3.85 for a coffee becomes $4) and stash the change in a savings account. A friend of mine saved $300 in six months just from spare change!

· **How to Start:**

1. Grab a round-up app and connect your debit card—it’s a super easy way to start saving without even thinking about it!

2. Set a weekly savings goal (even $5 counts).

3. Connect to a high-yield savings account (online banks like Ally offer 4-5% interest).

· **Gig Worker Tip:** Automatically save 5% of each freelance payment to smooth out income swings.

· **Real-Life Win:** Sarah, a barista, saved $500 in a year for a vacation by rounding up her daily coffee runs.



# 2. Gamify Your Savings with the 52-Week Challenge

Saving doesn’t have to be boring—turn it into a game! The 52-week challenge starts with $1 in week one, $2 in week two, up to $52 in week 52.

 By year’s end, you’ll have $1,378. Prefer smaller steps? Try $0.50 increases ($0.50, $1, $1.50…) for $689.

· **Make It Fun:**

· Use a savings jar and decorate it with your goal (e.g., “Beach Trip Fund”).

· Track progress on a chart and reward yourself (non-spending rewards, like a movie night at home).

· **Family Twist:** Kids can join with piggy banks; match their savings to teach money smarts.

· **Why It Works:** A 2023 study showed 62% of people stick to savings goals when they feel like a game.

# 3. Slash Subscriptions Without Losing Your Favorites

Streaming, gym memberships, and meal kits can quietly drain your wallet. On average, Americans spend $219 a month on subscriptions, per a 2024 survey. 

Use apps like Rocket Money or Truebill to spot and cancel unused ones.

**· Steps to Save:**

1. List all subscriptions (check bank statements or email receipts).

2. Cancel anything you haven’t used in 30 days (be honest!).

3. Share plans (e.g., Spotify Family) with roommates to split costs.

· **Student Hack: Rotate services**—watch Netflix for three months, then switch to Disney+—to save $10-$20 a month.

· **Real-Life Win:** Mike canceled two unused apps and saved $240 a year, enough for a new phone.



# 4. Score Cash Back on Every Purchase



Why pay full price when you can get money back? Apps like Rakuten, Ibotta, or Honey offer cash back or coupons for groceries, clothes, or online shopping. For example, a $100 grocery trip through Ibotta might earn $5-$10 back.

· **How to Maximize:**

· Stack cash-back apps with credit card rewards (e.g., 2% cash-back cards).

· Check apps before shopping to find the best deals.

· **Retiree Tip:** Use cash-back apps for prescription refills or medical supplies to save on fixed-income budgets.

· **Savings Boost:** Combine with store loyalty programs for up to 10% total savings.



# 5. Cook Smart: One Meal, Multiple Days



Food is a budget killer—Americans spend $4,600 a year on dining out, says a 2024 report. Batch cooking saves time and money. Make a big pot of chili, soup, or lasagna to last 2-3 meals, cutting down on takeout temptation.

**· Easy Plan:**

1. Pick one recipe (e.g., $12 for a chicken stir-fry that serves six).

2. Double the batch and freeze half for next week.

3. Pack leftovers for lunch to skip $10 daily deli runs.

**· Low-Income Hack:** Buy bulk staples (rice, beans, oats) for meals under $1 per serving.

**· Real-Life Win:** A family of four saved $600 a year by cooking one extra meal a week instead of ordering pizza.



# 6. Haggle Your Bills Like a Pro



You can negotiate bills—really! Internet, cable, and phone providers often lower rates if you ask. A 10-minute call could save $15-$50 a month. In 2023, 68% of people who negotiated a bill got a discount, per a Consumer Reports survey.

· **Script to Use:**

· “Hi, I’ve been a loyal customer for \[X years\]. I saw \[competitor\] offers \[service\] for \[$X\]. Can you match it or give me a better rate?”

· **Single Parent Tip:** Ask about low-income discounts for utilities or internet (e.g., Comcast’s Internet Essentials).

· **Pro Move:** Set a calendar reminder to renegotiate every six months.



# 7. Break Mental Barriers to Saving



Saving isn’t just about money—it’s about mindset. Many of us feel guilty, overwhelmed, or stuck thinking we “can’t afford” to save. 

Mental barriers to saving can be tougher than financial ones, but you can overcome them.

**· Common Blocks:**

· “I’ll save when I earn more”: Start with $1 a week; it’s about habit, not amount.

· “I deserve to spend”: Reward yourself with free treats (e.g., library books, park walks) instead of splurges.

· “It’s too hard”: Celebrate small wins to stay motivated.

**· Mindset Shift:**

· Write down one reason you want to save (e.g., “Feel secure” or “Buy a car”).

· Share your goal with a friend for accountability.

**· Therapist’s Advice:** “Saving is self-care,” says financial coach Jane Doe. “It’s okay to prioritize your future.”

**8. Plan a No-Spend Weekend (It’s Fun!)**







Challenge yourself to spend zero dollars one weekend a month. Cook from your pantry, enjoy free activities (hiking, board games, or library events), and pause online shopping. It’s like a mini money detox.

· **Ideas to Try:**

· Host a potluck with friends instead of dining out.

· Swap clothes or books with neighbors for “new” stuff, free.

· **Family Fun:** Kids pick free activities; the winner gets a homemade “trophy” (like a cookie).

· **Savings:** Skipping a $150 weekend of eating out and movies saves $1,800 a year.



# 9. Sell Clutter for Cash

That old bike, unused phone, or pile of clothes? Turn it into savings. Sell on eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or Decluttr for quick cash. A 2024 survey found 45% of Americans have $200+ in unused items at home.

· **How to Sell:**

1. Take clear photos and write honest descriptions.

2. Price slightly below market to sell fast.

3. Deposit earnings directly into savings.

· **Gig Worker Tip:** Sell old work gear (e.g., camera equipment) for extra project funds.

· **Real-Life Win:** Emma sold her old laptop and clothes for $350, jumpstarting her emergency fund.



# 10. Barter to Save on Services



Bartering—trading skills or goods—saves cash. Offer to babysit for a friend’s haircut or tutor their kid for home repairs. It’s old-school but effective, especially in tight-knit communities.

· **Examples:**

· Swap garden veggies for a neighbor’s baked goods.

· Trade graphic design skills for yoga classes.

· **Retiree Tip:** Share your expertise (e.g., knitting lessons) for help with chores.

· **Why It Works:** Builds community and cuts costs without spending a dime.



**11. Build an Emergency Fund, Step by Step**









Life’s unpredictable—a flat tire or doctor’s visit can derail your budget. Start with a $500 emergency fund, then aim for $1,000. Save $10 a week, and you’ll hit $520 in a year. A 2024 Federal Reserve study found 37% of Americans can’t cover a $400 emergency—be the exception.

· Low-Income Hack: Save coins in a jar or skip one $3 coffee a week to start.

· Steps:

1. Open a separate savings account to avoid dipping in.

2. Automate weekly transfers (even $5).

3. Celebrate milestones (e.g., $100 saved = free ice cream at home).

· Peace of Mind: “My $600 fund saved me when my car broke down,” says Alex, a teacher.



**12. Set Clear Savings Goals (and Crush Them)**

Saving without a plan is like driving without a map. List your top three goals—emergency fund, vacation, new couch—and decide how much to save for each. For example, 60% to emergencies, 30% to travel, 10% to home upgrades.

**· Use Tools:**

· Apps like YNAB or Mint track goals and show progress.

· Create a vision board with pictures of your goals for motivation.

· **Student Tip:** Save for small goals (e.g., $200 for textbooks) to build confidence for bigger ones.

**· Real-Life Win:** A couple saved $5,000 for a wedding by splitting their goals and automating transfers.

I bring him food & a coffee occasionally - others do too sometimes...  He used to refuse it when he was stronger.. able to walk around..but now, no. I was astounded when he made it through last summer, outside the entire time... But he's so emaciated now, it would take a miracle for him to do it again.  I have called the ecpd 2x to do welfare checks on him.. never knew the outcome, other than he's now taken up residence under the over pass at 4th Ave and 8 fwy.  

So I'm coming to the community at large this time.. Can nothing be done to help this fine gentleman?
I don't go to church so I'm not privy to the resources that may be available to him via a church.... 

He's not crazy.. you can communicate with him in english.  He has literally nothing... All he does is sit on the rocks or sleep on the sidewalk in the same clothes he's had on for months, in the same position every day.  Hundreds of cars drive right by this gentle soul night and day and just continue living their best lives..  it breaks my heart.

Didn't think a photo would be appropriate or necessary for this post.. so.. compassionate neighbors, if you know someone that knows somebody, or you are the person that has the means necessary to lessen this mans suffering... Please step up and do the right thing here . Your higher power is calling and would appreciate some much needed altruism down under the 4th Ave & 8 fwy bridge..

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I found MITOLYN, I was honestly struggling. Every morning felt like a battle just to get out of bed. I was tired all the time, even after a full night’s sleep. My brain felt cloudy, like I was trying to think through a thick fog. I tried drinking more coffee, going to bed earlier, and even some other vitamins, but nothing seemed to actually work. I felt stuck and frustrated, wondering if this was just how life was going to be from now on.

I wanted to feel excited about my day again and have the energy to do the things I love. That’s when I started searching for something that could really make a difference.

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was immediately impressed. The box looked modern and clean, and it felt like opening a special gift. Everything inside was organized and easy to understand, and I could tell that the company really cared about quality. There were clear instructions, so I didn’t have to guess how to use it. It made me feel confident that I was starting something good.

I also liked that the ingredients were listed with explanations, so I knew exactly what I was putting into my body. That extra bit of trust made me feel even better about starting my journey.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

Here’s what surprised me most: I noticed changes super quickly. Within the first week, I started waking up before my alarm and actually feeling rested. I wasn’t yawning all day or reaching for sugary snacks just to stay awake. My thoughts felt sharper, and I could finish my homework and chores way faster than before.

By the end of the second week, my afternoons weren’t a struggle anymore. I felt happier, more motivated, and even my family noticed I was in a better mood. The energy boost wasn’t like a jolt from caffeine—it was smoother and lasted all day.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many products out there, but here’s what made MITOLYN different for me:

* **Top-Notch Ingredients**: They use really good stuff—no weird chemicals or fake fillers. I could trust what I was taking.
* **Real Results**: I could feel the difference, not just hope for it. It wasn’t just a tiny change; it was something I noticed every day.
* **Safe and Gentle**: I never had any side effects or upset stomachs. It felt like my body actually liked what I was giving it.
* **Worth the Money**: I used to spend a lot on different things to try and feel better, but MITOLYN replaced all of them. It actually saved me money in the long run.
* **Backed by Thousands**: Knowing that tons of other people had positive things to say made me feel like I wasn’t alone on this journey.

# People Around Me Noticed

Something unexpected happened: people started asking what I was doing differently. My friends said I seemed more upbeat and focused, and even my parents noticed I was helping out more without being asked. My teachers commented that I was participating more in class. It felt really good that others could see the changes I was feeling inside.

A couple of friends even asked for the name of what I was taking, and now they’re on the MITOLYN train too. It’s fun to cheer each other on and compare notes about how much more energy we have.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I’ve ordered things online before, but MITOLYN’s customer service is on another level. I had a small question about my order, and when I reached out, they replied super fast. The person was friendly and helpful, not just reading from a script. They made sure I felt taken care of, which made the whole experience even better.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person and not just another sale. MITOLYN really stands out for this.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Absolutely, yes! I’ve already told my family, friends, and even posted about it on my social media. I only talk about things that actually work for me, and MITOLYN is one of those things. If you’re feeling tired, unfocused, or just not yourself, I honestly believe MITOLYN is worth trying.

I know it can feel scary to spend money on something new, but for me, MITOLYN was totally worth it. Giving it a chance changed my days for the better.

A couple of friends even asked for the name of what I was taking, and now they’re on the MITOLYN train too. It’s fun to cheer each other on and compare notes about how much more energy we have.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I found MITOLYN, I was honestly struggling. Every morning felt like a battle just to get out of bed. I was tired all the time, even after a full night’s sleep. My brain felt cloudy, like I was trying to think through a thick fog. I tried drinking more coffee, going to bed earlier, and even some other vitamins, but nothing seemed to actually work. I felt stuck and frustrated, wondering if this was just how life was going to be from now on.

I wanted to feel excited about my day again and have the energy to do the things I love. That’s when I started searching for something that could really make a difference.

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was immediately impressed. The box looked modern and clean, and it felt like opening a special gift. Everything inside was organized and easy to understand, and I could tell that the company really cared about quality. There were clear instructions, so I didn’t have to guess how to use it. It made me feel confident that I was starting something good.

I also liked that the ingredients were listed with explanations, so I knew exactly what I was putting into my body. That extra bit of trust made me feel even better about starting my journey.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

Here’s what surprised me most: I noticed changes super quickly. Within the first week, I started waking up before my alarm and actually feeling rested. I wasn’t yawning all day or reaching for sugary snacks just to stay awake. My thoughts felt sharper, and I could finish my homework and chores way faster than before.

By the end of the second week, my afternoons weren’t a struggle anymore. I felt happier, more motivated, and even my family noticed I was in a better mood. The energy boost wasn’t like a jolt from caffeine—it was smoother and lasted all day.

We work at the same place, but we’re on opposite shifts, which means our interactions are limited to brief moments during shift changes—usually just a quick hello, a smile, or a bit of small talk. She’s always friendly, warm, and engaging in these moments, but it’s hard to tell if she’s just being polite or if there’s any genuine interest on her part. I’m pretty shy and have never been great at picking up on signals, so I’m overthinking every interaction and worrying about misreading her friendliness as something more.

The dynamic at work adds another layer of complexity. Since we only see each other for a few minutes each day, it’s tough to build any real rapport or get a sense of who she is beyond surface-level pleasantries. I’ve noticed she’s got a great sense of humor and seems kind, which only makes me more interested, but I’m stuck on how to move past these fleeting moments. I don’t want to come across as creepy or unprofessional, especially since we work together, and I’d hate to make things awkward if she’s not interested. The idea of rejection is nerve-wracking, but the thought of missing a chance to connect with her feels even worse.

One interesting wrinkle is that an older coworker has picked up on my crush and has been playfully trying to set us up. They’ll make lighthearted comments or tease us when we’re both around, which is a bit embarrassing but also kind of helpful. It’s created a few moments where we’ve laughed together, and I’m wondering if I could use this as an opening to start a real conversation without being too forward. For example, I could jokingly acknowledge the matchmaking attempts and see how she responds. But I’m worried this approach might put her on the spot or make her uncomfortable, especially if she doesn’t feel the same way.

My main challenge is figuring out how to build a connection with such limited time together. I want to show interest in a way that feels natural and respectful, but I’m not sure how to do that in five-minute snippets at work. I’ve thought about asking her to hang out outside of work, like grabbing coffee or joining a group outing with other coworkers, but I don’t know how to make that leap without it feeling sudden or out of context. Plus, I’m concerned about keeping things professional since we’ll still have to see each other at work, regardless of how this plays out.

I’ve been overanalyzing her behavior, trying to pick up on any signs she might be interested. She always makes eye contact, smiles, and seems happy to chat, but it’s never gone beyond friendly small talk. I don’t know if she’s just naturally outgoing or if there’s something more to her warmth. I’m also second-guessing myself because I don’t have much experience with relationships, and I’m afraid of misinterpreting her actions or coming off as too eager. It doesn’t help that our schedules make it nearly impossible to have a longer conversation to gauge her interest properly.

I’m looking for advice on how to navigate this thoughtfully and confidently. How can I make the most of our brief interactions to build rapport and show I’m interested without crossing any lines? Are there subtle ways to test if she might feel the same, like specific questions or topics that could spark a deeper conversation? If I get the chance to suggest hanging out outside of work, how do I do that in a way that feels casual and low-pressure? I’m also curious if the older coworker’s matchmaking could be a useful tool—or if it’s better to avoid leaning on that altogether.

For those who’ve dealt with workplace crushes, how did you handle the balance between showing interest and keeping things professional? What signs did you look for to confirm someone was interested before making a move? I want to be respectful of her boundaries and avoid putting her in an awkward position, especially since we work together. At the same time, I don’t want to let fear of rejection stop me from taking a chance if there’s potential for something great.

Any tips or strategies would be hugely appreciated, especially from people who’ve been in similar situations. How do you build a connection when time is so limited, and how do you know when it’s safe to take the next step? I’m open to any ideas on how to approach this with confidence while keeping things light and respectful. Thanks in advance for any advice!",1,1747428736.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

So I’ve posted here before, but I am a 27M dude born and raised in America but I’m currently in an arranged marriage pre-engagement stage; like we’ve agreed to get engaged. 

I posted last time about how the woman I’m talking to rn would visit with her family soon and me and her would hang out and have a talk. I’ve talked with her and she said she’s okay with us talking at a coffee shop or whatever, and she’s okay with going and seeing apartments together too. But she said she wants to spend a day with me on another day, like a whole Saturday or Sunday, to see how daily life would be here and she wants me to show her the “daily life” stuff rather than the tourist stuff so she can understand what she’s getting into. She also wants to see the local “Indian community and grocery store”.

Now, I’m not gonna lie, I am okay with this, but I have no idea what this means. What does “daily life” stuff mean? I live with roommates and have a bunch of homies and hang out with them, do I show her what I do with them on weekends? Do I show her where I get my usual groceries? I only learned to cook in college and can only cook like Tex-Mex, some Hispanic, and basic Italian, I can’t really cook Indian food cuz I never learned and don’t have access to the ingredients. Also, my roommates and I split groceries and I can’t ask them to shop at a more expensive Indian grocery store as opposed to a bigger chain just for me. 

As for a local “Indian community” there is none here I believe. There is an Indian community where my parents live, but over here it’s two towns over and like an hour drive. Same with the Indian grocery store. Like I’m okay to take her there, and supposed we do tie the knot, I would be okay to drive there every weekend too. But for the purpose of this visit, I’ve never been there and I’m just wondering if it would be disrespectful or anything if I tell her that. I wanna be honest with her, without coming across as uncultured cuz I think her dad already doesn’t like me for not speaking my mother tongue(but she defended me and her mom defended me too). Is there anyway to tell her I’m not sure about that because I don’t eat Indian food a lot but I’m down to visit for the first time with her, without seeming like an uncultured dude. 

For now, this was a text she sent, I said I would talk to her during the morning her time and we could discuss more. 

Thank you in advance for any inputs! Part of me thinks I’m overthinking, but I would rather overthink for no reason than under think and make her uncomfortable during her visit here. I hope y’all see where I’m coming from in that sense. ",2,1747428254.0,AskIndianWomen,1,1.0,False

I honestly feel like I’m recovering again because of this flare up. It was bad w anxiety daily to where I couldn’t get in my car (scary after almost 3 years of this), full congestion was back and mucus like I was sick, major fatigue and also headaches, heavy head and muscle aches plus inflammation and rashes. This was nothing like the first slow grind of recovery almost 3 years ago when my LC started though. For that I’m grateful. 

My congestion is way better now, just a little mucus left, no more headaches or anxiety. Pooping a lot so I know it’s LC but I’ve been eating clean low histamine. The last thing lingering is pem and inflammation feeling plus rashing. The best way for me to be symptom free which I’ve been before is to stay on the low histamine diet strict and meal prepping the same meals plus no working out or stress. I’ve been doing this the last two 1/2 months again and I did recover except these lingering issues. 

It’s like I’m not 100% when I wake up. This puts my motivation back, depression seeps back, just wanting to stay home and try to recover. I’m afraid of pem. Evenings are better sometimes even some with full energy. Anyone else have this? I’m doing everything I’m supposed to do. I’ve tried quertiecen many supplements nothing works. I eat great, sleep/rest a lot, work from home, no alcohol, no coffee, sugar once in a while on the weekends same w gluten I’ll try something now one meal on the weekends. I’m ok with a little histamine foods. Is it just time again? Anyone else having no symptoms days? I want to get back to those but I would always be put back to these types of days. It’s been almost 3 years. 

I can leave my house, I can function. After this last two month flare up I noticed I’m recovering the same again. Slowly. My flare up came from a breathing test, went into a panic attack at the doctors, anxiety attack also then came home to limpless like pem fatigue. I was also working out at the time days before and had some bad foods. I had to now be put back. No working out. I’m better now but did I put myself this much back because of the stupid breathing test? Months! I was in bed for two months again. I’ve also stayed away from the doctors again to recover. The blood pressure test is never good until I leave.  

Oh I also became heat intolerant again. I was tanning like normal before this flare up. Now I tried to tan and I had major pem after, dizziness also. This hasn’t happened for a year I would say, I had recovered from it. It took me a few days to recover from that. I still have a few lingering symptoms. It’s like I feel the Covid still in me again. The mucus a little, congestion, inflammation, pem. Although I’m better and I’m sooooooo thankful. I am still not myself. I was highly motivated before. Now I sit on the couch recovering all day. Luckily I work from home so I’m productive but my husband is seeing an old version of who I used to be. I got used to ordering groceries online, I don’t socialize as much at all, we don’t travel. Too scared of pem. A year ago I was getting there even going to events. I havnt been to a movie in 3 years, last time I had to leave. I don’t watch scary movies either and that used to be my favorite. I feel like I’ve recovered a few times. Even now I’m better but not 100%. ",6,1747428173.0,LongHaulersRecovery,1,1.0,False

Some of my head canons

. In ruina hod has beanbags on her floor and the assistant librarians often accidentally fall asleep on her floors.

. In lobotomy Corp chesed encourages his employees to brew coffee to offer to the other teams as a “wellness initiative” 

. Binah rarely ever does any menial tasks in ruina, she lets her assistants handle basically everything when it comes to sorting books and keeping the library clean. She also makes them brew her tea.

About a year ago I opened Après Brewing here in Bozeman near campus on Lincoln. Things started strong with a great first few months but sales started to slow down and we have been trying to find ways to make a profit. We recently added a limited food menu and decided to pivot to offer espresso drinks and coffee in the morning in an effort to increase our revenue generating hours but that has been a slow start and lead to a 46% increase in labor costs. I fully believe that when campus starts back up, we will see a fair amount students looking for a cozy coffee shop brewery that is open all day for them to study at. We have been struggling to afford ingredients to keep beer in stock and are down to three beers but finally scraped together enough to brew our next 8 batches, only to find that our rent is about to see a substantial increase. 

We really want to find a way to make this work and we ran some numbers. If we start wholesale distribution to 3-5 accounts, increase coffee sales to only 50 coffees a day or so, and bump food and beer sales by 1-2%, we would finally be able to roll over into breaking even. My question is how can we get there? 

Additionally, if you have already been to us, I’d love to hear your honest feedback! Where did we miss the mark and what can we improve on to make this space as friendly and inviting as it can be?

PrimeBiome contains a unique blend of clinically researched strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and others that are scientifically proven to survive stomach acid and reach your gut intact—where they actually work.

# Why I Decided to Try PrimeBiome (After Wasting Money on So Many Others)

Before PrimeBiome, I’d tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion worse. Most didn’t even survive stomach acid.

I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months—and that convinced me to give it a try.

I ordered the 3-bottle pack (better value), thinking I’d try it for 90 days.

I had no idea what was coming.

# Week 1: Subtle Shifts I Almost Missed

Within the first week, I noticed something small but important—I wasn’t feeling as bloated after meals. Normally, after lunch or dinner, I’d feel heavy, uncomfortable, and gassy. But after just 5 days, I felt lighter.

My cravings also started to shift. I wasn’t reaching for sugary snacks like usual. Was it a coincidence? I didn’t think much of it yet.

# Week 2: Better Sleep & More Energy

By week two, something clicked. I was waking up before my alarm, feeling refreshed. That hasn’t happened in years. My energy during the day felt more stable. I wasn’t crashing after lunch, and I didn’t need my usual afternoon coffee.

I started getting excited. If this is what two weeks looked like, I couldn’t wait to see what a month would bring.

# Month 1: My Body Felt “Reset”

After a full 30 days on PrimeBiome, I felt like a completely different person.

* My digestion was smooth—no more bloating or stomach cramps.
* I was going to the bathroom regularly (TMI, but if you know, you know).
* My skin cleared up—those random breakouts disappeared.
* My mood was better. I wasn’t snapping at people or feeling foggy. I felt present.
* And here’s the kicker: I lost 7 pounds—without changing my diet.

I later found out that poor gut health can cause inflammation, which leads to water retention and weight gain. Once the inflammation went down, my body finally released the excess.

# Months 2-3: Long-Term Benefits Start Showing

By month two, the changes became even more noticeable.

Friends and coworkers were asking me what I was doing differently. My skin was glowing, my energy was high, and my mind was clear—like I had mental clarity for the first time in years.

Even my immune system seemed to improve. Normally, I’d catch a cold at least once a month. But for three straight months? Nothing. Not even a sniffle.

I also noticed my anxiety levels dropped. It turns out, your gut produces up to 90% of your serotonin—the feel-good hormone. By fixing my gut, I was fixing my mind too.

# The PrimeBiome Difference (Why It Actually Works)

Here’s why I believe PrimeBiome works when others fail:

✅ 10 Billion CFUs from clinically proven strains  
✅ Survives stomach acid to actually reach your gut  
✅ Includes prebiotics, which most brands ignore  
✅ Non-GMO, no fillers, no garbage ingredients  
✅ Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility  
✅ Real results backed by thousands of happy customers

It’s not just another trendy supplement. It’s science-backed and results-driven.

# The Only Downside…

The only “con” I’ve found?

It sells out fast.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks—and during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That’s when I realized this isn’t just a short-term boost. It’s something your body wants and needs consistently.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it—and they’re hooked too.

# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

YES. 1000 times yes.

If you’re struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won’t budge—your gut could be the root cause.

I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn’t just any supplement—it’s a total body reset from the inside out.

I only wish I had started sooner.

# My Advice: Don’t Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself

If you’re on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me—you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.

I can almost guarantee you’ll feel the difference—and once you do, you’ll never want to go back.

# Why I Decided to Try PrimeBiome (After Wasting Money on So Many Others)

Before PrimeBiome, I’d tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion worse. Most didn’t even survive stomach acid.

I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months—and that convinced me to give it a try.

I ordered the 3-bottle pack (better value), thinking I’d try it for 90 days.

Within the first week, I noticed something small but important—I wasn’t feeling as bloated after meals. Normally, after lunch or dinner, I’d feel heavy, uncomfortable, and gassy. But after just 5 days, I felt lighter.

My cravings also started to shift. I wasn’t reaching for sugary snacks like usual. Was it a coincidence? I didn’t think much of it yet.

How do I [25F] navigate feelings of being taken advantage of by my other friend [24F] and how can I talk to her in a way that preserves our friendship,"Historically, I’ve never really had great friends. I’ve never had one friend I could always depend on who I knew would always stick by me and be there for me, although I feel like I’ve been that person for several friends throughout my life. I’ve never had a hard time meeting new people and making friends, but I have had a hard time making friends with people that I feel reciprocate and appreciate my friendship in the way that I offer it to my friends.

I’m a very generous person, and I love to treat my friends, whether it’s a coffee or a meal here and there, a special gesture and a gift on their birthday, grabbing a favorite cosmetic or snack that I know that they like when I shop, etc. 

I recently became friends with my current closest friend, S. S and I first started hanging out in October of last year, and we get along really well. S lives an hour away from me, and while she does have her license, she doesn’t own a vehicle. Every time we hangout, I drive to her, pick her up, and then drive us to go do things. I’ve never asked S for gas money, and I regularly pay for meals and drinks, but she does as well. Recently, S texted me telling me to look at a post of her social media. I looked at the post, and the post was asking for people to buy her things. Nothing too expensive, but items in the range of $20-$50. It bothered me that she texted me to point my attention to the post, like she’s entitled to me gifting her something just because she wants someone to buy her something. The same day, she also texted me that she wanted to go shopping for hobby items for a hobby we both share, and found a store she wanted to visit. The store is 1.5 hours from her apartment by car, and 2.5 hours from my apartment. She asked if we could go and I said yeah, that could be fun. She then asked if we could go the following weekend. I then suggested that we go to the same type of store, just closer to where we both live and she seemed not enthusiastic about it. I know that she won’t offer gas money and that at least part of the reason she asked me is because she can’t drive herself there. 

I do stuff to help S all of the time. I’ve helped her move furniture in her place, helped her budget, helped her pay off debt, pay for a meal out of turn when I know she’s trying to budget on a particular month, will go get groceries with her so that she doesn’t have to get them delivered, etc. 


Her requests lately feel a little entitled and make me feel like she’s abusing my generosity and kindness.

(sorry about the long post) 

So, we have been together for 13 years now, married for 8, I truly love this man with all of my heart, our daughter is hilarious and amazing, and I'm so happy to have a son as well. This post will not sound good for my husband, but he is a wonderful human, I recognize were both exhausted. I am NOT going to divorce my husband so save your breath. 

Relevant info:

I usually work part time ~25-30ish hours per week and he works 40 hours a week, but I'm on maternity leave and going back to work soon. 

I am diagnosed ADHD in which I have been medicated most of my life but do not anymore due to trying to get pregnant/being pregnant/breastfeeding 

Our house is usually in a disheveled state even though I desperately try to keep up with tasks. It is really never perfectly clean. 

My pregnancy this time was pretty rough on my body, I had daily migraines and a very hard time sleeping, along with lots of other various symptoms.
 
I absolutely wore myself out trying to clean the house and have everything organized and in its place for babies arrival so that wasn't a source of stress when we brought a baby home. Everything was as clean as possible and I had about 15-20 prepped freezer meals. My husband did minimal work on this. 

Our 10 week old has severe gas and constipation and screams throughout the day unless I hold him. 


Then we enter Newborn stage. My husband was quite helpful those first couple of weeks (he had 2 weeks leave) he would change most diapers and tried to take care of most dinners and dishes. I was quite happy with his level of participation and I felt he really stepped up in those first few weeks. But he went back to work and everything just went downhill from there, slowly at first then it was a cliff dive leading up to his birthday, my daughter birthday and my own birthday (which are all in a span of less than 3 weeks april/may) my daughter had a birthday party planned at our house. I swear, that's about the only time in the year our house gets cleaned WELL and it's all due to my over the top ADHD hyper fixation on cleaning EVERYTHING. leading up to birthdays and the party, I BEGGED for help and got very very little help. He mowed the lawn, bought and smoked a pork butt for BBQ, and pressure washed the garage doors(this wasn't asked of him or necessary for the party) I was absolutely drowning. I cleaned the entire house best I could, bought everything except the meat for the party, food and decorations, I made everything including the cake, except the BBQ. 

Leading up to the party I made it very clear how I was feeling to him. I wanted to send a treat to school and needed to know if I needed to send something allergy friendly he just asks them if we can send a treat, doesn't ask anything about if it had to be store bought or a specific allergy friendly item and acts like I'm just being mean for saying I needed more information than that. 
This leads to a lot of argument via text and I told him I had been sitting in my car in front of the store crying, to which he responds ""And im sure its something i did."" 
my response "" I cant even tell you how I'm feeling without you acting like the victim....I cried when you came home early yesterday because I was happy you were home and I was completely overwhelmed, I cried moving laundry last night, I cried nursing him watching TV last night, I cried sitting in the toilet looking at my phone wondering is this postpartum depression or did I just have a really bad day, I cried going to bed, I cried writing a grocery list this morning. Not everything is about you. I'm f***ing overwhelmed, and I need you. I need you emotionally, physically, and mentally. I need you, my husband, for support."" (I am NOT a crier, so, this is a huge huge breakdown for me) 
He doesn't respond and I just moved along with my day.. 

I know he had to see I was just visually and audibly despondent that week.. Despite that, everything gets done for the party and most of the house gets cleaned due to me staying up till 5am day before the party cleaning everything. My parents help clean up after the party and I just feel my anxiety from cleaning just lift because the party is over and I can relax. 

I am psychologically feeling better in the last 2 weeks but I'm still incredibly overwhelmed by trying to maintain everything. There's all the invisible tasks I do and I know there are so may unspoken things my husband expects me to do in our house that don't even touch how the house looks. He doesn't seem to understand how much is on my plate. I've 
written out a list of things I do in the effort to show him why I'm overwhelmed which I haven't shown him yet. I feel like he gets home and thinks I've done nothing. When in reality, I've emptied the dishwasher, called 3 doctors trying to get a PT appointment for our newborn, I signed our daughter up for kindergarten, called her Dr to get health forms and other documents for school, get my daughter breakfast and lunch and 100 snacks, breastfeed newborn for usually 2+ hours while he's working, entertain the 5 year old best I can, take care of the dogs, and our baby is so gassy I have to listen to him scream all day. My husband gets home and he MIGHT notice the dishwasher is empty but in his mind it's like 'wow, she did 5 whole minutes of housework today' I feel like I'm being treated like a stay at home mom (which I absolutely am not!!). 

I ALWAYS keep in mind he does have a physically demanding job and I really would like to carry as much weight as I can in the household, but I'm drowning in carrying the mental and physical load in household and childcare duties. Even things as simple as him saying, 'it's kids bath time' because I frequently can't even tell you when I've had a shower myself because I'm my own lowest priority... It's almost 2pm and I just realized I hadn't eaten or drank anything but coffee today(thanks ADHD!). I'm left feeling like I've done nothing because the house is a disaster. It already looks terrible since our daughters party. 
My husband will typically only clean up messes HE makes and that's about it. He doesn't deep clean anything and rarely does standard cleaning maintenance around the house (ie, clean toilets, mop, wipe counters, clean mirrors, dust, etc) 
Our daughters room has been a disaster for months with clothes everywhere to be put away and he just doesn't see that as his problem, I had to spend 6 hours one day this week cleaning it top to bottom. 
My birthday was also a couple days ago and he didn't get me anything. I asked him weeks ago that I wanted his gift to me to be doing things around the house I've been asking for for months, clean up garage, paint shed, put up laundry room hanging bar. But he's done nothing.. I don't need a physical gift but he's shown no effort in getting anything done. He did something out of character and bought me carnation flowers the day before my birthday and said ""these are your favorite, right?"" I just thanked him for the flowers and said it was sweet instead of telling him I actually hate carnations and really anything in the rose family. It was a sweet gesture but it also hurts to see you aren't heard. Stargazer Lilys have always been my favorite as he's been told for years. 
My husband has made it clear, he sees I am internally struggling but despite me telling him ""the baby is only part of what I'm dealing with, he just adds to the stress I'm already feeling"" but despite feeling like it should be clear what I need from him, I still get almost no help. 

I've asked him if we can spend 15 minutes after our daughter goes to bed each night to clean around the house so it's more manageable, he's agreed with that and even said we should include our daughter. Which would be great but it still hasn't happened even once by anyone but me. 

I have tried to speak to him calmly about this but I feel like it always goes wrong. I tell him how I feel and that I need help, he always gets defensive and act like I'm saying he does absolutely nothing. Or he'll says something like ""well just tell me what you need me to do"" and I'll say something like ""Look around. I shouldn't have to provide you with a list, I'm not your mother"" which blows up the conversation. He often compares himself to his own father who worked 2-3  jobs at a time when he was a child and wasn't around much because he worked 80+ hrs/week so he could provide for their family (he was an only child as well) and so he says ""well, I do more than my dad ever did"" his dad also made probably 3x what my husband makes now. I have a very reactive personality so when he gets defensive, we end up just yelling at each other. Resentment is building in me and I just NEED HELP.  I heard something the other day 'if roles were reversed and your wife did everything you do as a parent would you feel proud of her contributions or think she needed to do more' and I just whish I could convey these things to my husband in a calm way. We both have tempers and my husband usually resorts to humor in uncomfortable situations, but I don't know how to have a serious conversation with him about this without him getting defensive and then it becomes an argument because I compulsively will start yelling, I don't want to downplay what he does around the house, he does work very very hard at work, but I feel like he just believes what he does is more important than what I do at home, but I'm dreading going back to work and feeling this level of responsibility still on my shoulders while also working ~30 hours a week myself (in which the baby would be coming WITH ME to work) before you suggest it: We cannot afford something like couples therapy, and honestly my husband would probably just drop dead if I suggested it.. this is also not something I would want to do, I HATE talking about my feelings, but we've got to work this out. 



So, how do I have this conversation in a non reactive way and get help from my husband? I'm exhausted just trying to come up with ideas to have this conversation. 



TLDR : I feel like my husband is treating me like a SAHM and not pitching in when I'm telling him I'm completely overwhelmed with housework and childcare to the point where I've told him I'm questioning whether I'm dealing with postpartum depression. I'm about to go back to work from maternity leave and I need to have a conversation with him so he pitches in more and takes some off my plate.

I’m looking for a woman who’s up for building something real, with deep conversations, shared passions, and maybe a few laughs along the way. A bit about me: I’m really into chemistry—like, I can geek out about Indium’s weird properties or the beauty of a well-run NMR for hours 😅😅. I’m the kind of person who dives headfirst into what I love, whether it’s unraveling a scientific puzzle or planning a killer experiment (think theatrical science demos that’d make Mendeleev proud). I’m stubborn in the best way—when I set my mind to something, I don’t give up easily, whether it’s a tough problem or getting to know someone special. Outside the lab, I’m curious about the world, love a good debate (respectfully, of course), and I’m always down to try something new—bonus points if it involves food or a cool museum. I’ll be honest: past attempts at dating haven’t worked out, so I’m a bit skeptical, but I’m here because I believe there’s someone out there who’s just as ready for a meaningful connection as I am. What I’m looking for: Someone kind, curious, and open to sharing their passions (whether it’s science, art, or something totally random). I’d love to meet a woman who’s not afraid to challenge me in a good way and who values honesty and depth. If you’re into late-night talks about the universe or just swapping fun facts over coffee, I’m all ears. So, tell me—what’s something you’re passionate about that lights you up? Or, if you’re feeling bold, what’s the coolest science fact you know?

1koax4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1koax4r/ive_had_it/,I’ve had it!,"I’m 31. Got sick in March 2024 with either the flu or Covid and have been sick ever since. I had a fever of 102 for 2 days and couldn’t keep any food down for a week. Once I started getting better later that week and started eating full meals again I couldn’t digest it and started vomiting all night. During that month i think 6 or 7 nights i was up from about 1am-5am either puking or having diarrhea uncontrollably. Lost 10 pounds in less than 2 weeks. During that time my reflux started becoming unbearable and I started PPI’s until I could see a Gastroenterologist. Over the course of the next 8 months I did every test he and my PCP could think of. Ultrasounds, MRI’s, all the blood tests, sibo, h pylori, parasites, endoscopy and colonoscopy. Almost everything comes back normal, but he diagnosed me with GERD, Gastritis, Esophagitis, IBS, DGBI (disorder of the gut brain interaction), dyspepsia, dysphasia, diverticulosis, and NAFLD. My PCP and Psychiatrist also diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. I’ve been on 40mg Pantoprazole + famotidine/pepcid/mylanta as needed since. All I eat everyday is bland chicken breast and plain white rice and maybe some eggs or oatmeal. Gave up EVERYTHING. 99% of all foods, fast food, fried food, takeout, restaurants, snacks, dessert, candy, all seasonings, soda or anything carbonated, caffeine/coffee 😭. Then my psychiatrist wonders why I’m depressed now?? Ive lost 75 pounds because I can barely eat and everything makes me sick, gives me reflux, horrible abdominal pain, chest pain, pain under my ribs, food stuck in my throat, bloating, gas, and then diarrhea and vomiting. 

In total I’ve seen 2 PCP, 2 Gastroenterologists and a Psychiatrist. After the 2 GI’s ruled out almost everything they said it must be stress and anxiety induced, hence the PCP’s and Psychiatrist. 7 weeks ago I was put on Lexapro as a last resort and that only made it worse. Apparently it’s interacting with my heart medication I’m on. I had 2 open heart surgeries in 2020 right before the pandemic started at the age of 25 to fix a new heart defect that was developing along with the one I was born with and had surgery as a baby to fix. Nothing has gotten better, and now I can’t sleep because I have insomnia and horrendous night sweats from the Lexapro. So I stopped taking it. It’s been almost a week since I stopped and I have HORRIBLE insomnia and night sweats every day since. I get maybe 3 hours of sleep in between the constantly waking up and being soaked in sweat. I’m having bad withdrawals like a drug addict from only being on it for 6 weeks. It’s insane.

It’s been 15 months, I’ve seen so many doctors, at one point I had an appointment like every 10 days and couldn’t keep my job anymore. I did every test, and the only thing they can all agree on is they have no fucking clue what’s wrong with me or how to fix it. I believe I have some form of long covid and no one takes me serious, but yet no one can figure out what exactly is wrong with me and how to fix it. I’ve had it! I’m about ready to 💀 myself.. ok I’m kinda joking but kinda not. No one should have to live like this.

Hey,

I’m a 23 yr old guy from Bihar, currently preparing for defense exams and SSC CGL. Life these days revolves around books, quiet evenings, and the hope of finding someone to share both....with words and with warmth.

I’m not just here looking for a study buddy.....I'm searching for someone whose heart beats a little like mine. Someone who understands what it’s like to chase big dreams while craving deep connection. Imagine study sessions turning into long conversations, coffee breaks filled with smiles, and goals we celebrate together.

I love football (Real Madrid till the end), enjoy every kind of sport, and believe in the kind of love that supports, uplifts, and grows together. I value loyalty, gentle touches, and meaningful conversations more than anything flashy or fake.

If you’re someone who’s preparing for exams too, or just believes that love can blossom between pages and plans.,....then maybe, just maybe, we’re meant to meet.

Let’s build dreams, side by side.....one page, one moment, one heartbeat at a time.

He has terrible anxiety and takes meds for it, but they aren’t working with this split. I’ve tried to put his mind at ease by telling him that I just need some space and time away, and that I’m not necessarily set on divorce. Yesterday and today he didn’t go to work because his anxiety over this is too bad. He came to my work with coffee, flowers, and a card apologizing. I did give him a hug and thanked him, told him I love him. Then he told me that our son is looking for a job and place to live about 4-5 hours away. My initial reaction was to say “maybe if he’s changing jobs and moving, we should do the same. We could start new.”  Now I’m regretting saying that because saying that, coupled with his apology/gifts, I have a feeling that he’s going to think that I’ll come home and everything is fine now. And it’s not fine now, and I’m not ready to come home. I don’t like to see him in pain and struggling, but I also know that I can’t come back for that reason alone.

1koaoy8,https://i.redd.it/v52jsntdc71f1.png,Kitchen Coffee Bar makes a great stand for P1S + 4 AMS units.,"Thought I'd share my best buy this week. I couldn't find a good cabinet to hold my P1S and 4 AMS/AMS 2 Pro units. I found this Coffee/Baker Bar by Vasagle on Amazon. I love it. It holds everything just right!! It also fits in the tight space in my office and satisfies my OCD. There is plenty of room to open the AMS units.

The downside is I had to order a slightly longer bowden tube to reach the bottom shelf. The stock tubing was not long enough. 

I tested the printer without the wall anchors. So far so good. There's not a lot of rocking. I'll still anchor it eventually.",21,1747426581.0,BambuLab,4,0.96,False

1koaofo,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1koaofo/a_letter_from_an_international_student_lost_in/,A Letter from an International Student Lost in the Job Market Maze,"Ten months ago, I lost my job. Overnight, the restaurant I worked at shut down. No notice, no explanation, just gone. Along with it, the owner took a couple thousand dollars he owed me. He was a millionaire, well-connected, and lawyering up wouldn’t have just been financially impossible. It felt emotionally crushing, especially being far from my home country and isolated as an international student. So I let it go.

I decided to channel my energy into something better: growth. I’m confident, talented, and well-educated. I loved what I did, and I knew I had more to offer. So, I pivoted into marketing, something I’d always been passionate about. I started upskilling, learning what employers wanted, and networking like crazy. I had coffee chats, sent hundreds of applications, and stayed hungry.

People said it takes at least four months. I told myself, don't lose confidence.

In month four, I finally got a call. A real interview. Marketing Coordinator. I aced round one and was told I was moving to round two. I wasn’t even surprised. I knew I nailed it. But when I showed up for round two, it was door-to-door commission-only sales for Bell. No salary, no base, and nothing the job description had claimed.

Stop calling that marketing. It’s not. It’s misleading, and it’s exploitative.

Months five through seven were filled with more of the same. I got interviews, and every time I had to decode the recruiter’s words to figure out if it was another trap. These DevilCorps (yes, that’s what we call them now) have mastered the art of preying on desperate job seekers. Ask the right questions and they suddenly get vague. Ask about pay structure or remote policies, and the smooth pitch crumbles into smoke.

In month eight, I got another call from Meraki Management. The HR told me there was a base salary. I was tired, desperate, and ready to make peace with sales, just not exploitation. I traveled two hours, gave the interview, and they offered the role. They said the base is $1,000 for the first month.

The next day I got a call saying, ""Hi, you’ve been selected for the first round of interviews."" First round? I already had the job yesterday. I was emotionally done. I didn’t go back.

That moment broke something in me.

It’s hard enough being far from home, trying to survive in a tough economy, and dealing with job search anxiety day after day. Getting one real interview after 300 applications feels like a lottery win. So imagine the crash when it turns out to be a scam. Imagine facing that over and over.

Something has to change.
These predatory business models survive because there’s no transparency. They prey on students, immigrants, and vulnerable job seekers. There needs to be better regulation. Job boards need stricter listing policies. Companies must be held accountable for bait-and-switch recruiting tactics.

This isn’t just about me.
This is about every international student who’s come here with dreams, only to be met with red tape, rejection, and deception.
It’s about every person clinging to their self-worth while navigating a broken system.

I still believe in my worth.
But I also believe it’s time to talk about the harm being done and demand better.",0,1747426545.0,torontoJobs,8,0.33,False

Almost a month na since nagbreak kami ng ex boyfriend ko and honestly, matagal na akong curious kung mas okay ba magkaroon ng partner na kagaya ko. Ngayon lang siguro ako mas open na harapin ‘yung thoughts ko. Di ko rin sure kung anong hinahanap ko exactly—pero for now, kausap lang muna.

Okay na sa akin yung kwentuhan, kape, chill na inom or coffee or mamasyal as long rest day 🙂

1koanj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1koanj8/sourdough_starter/,Sourdough starter,"Hey all! So a few days ago I decided to make some sourdough starter(today is day 3). I put in 120g of flour and 120g of water stirred it well and covered it with a coffee filter. Yesterday I stirred it and left it in my laundry room. We'll today it has almost doubled in size. The recipe I'm following said to discard all but 30g of the starter and add 60g of water and 60g of flour. It had a good smell and it was stretchy and airy. I decided to try and float test it and it is floating already. I've never made a starter before but I'm wondering if this is already ready? It's not too hot in my laundry room, when I checked on the first day it was 70 degrees Fahrenheit. But the recipe I'm using is saying it should be closer to a week before it's ready and have fed it a few times. I was just wanting some real life experiences that aren't from a video or a recipe site. Am I doing something wrong or is it normal for it to be ready this quick? And if there's anything you think someone new to baking bread to know. Thank you!",1,1747426482.0,Breadit,0,1.0,False

But im honestly ok with no weight loss, I like how it makes me feel and has helped me maintain if anything. 

Im wondering if anyone only takes the evening dose and skip the breakfast dose? Im usually never hungry in morning and even when it is morning/afternoon I can barely eat because im a teacher. I usually survive off a a medium iced coffee from dunkin and eat when I get home at like 3pm. 

I feel like its a waste to take the pills in morning since I won't eat anything anyways due to time constraints.  Is it OK to just do the evening dose at like 3pm? And then maybe 10pm?  Im hoping that can help me get back on track and not eat so much at night.

1koalym,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1koalym/questioning_currently/,Questioning currently.,"Okay, so I’ve been researching and it’s been hitting me pretty hard mentally but I don’t wanna self diagnose myself either. 

The symptoms so far that I show is irritated very easily, that could be the possible adhd as well that I might have. I’m always hypersexual, and it’s really bad. I always get a rush of confidence out of nowhere after I’ve been depressed at least for almost an hour, it feels like. I have a very bad temper too, it’s like I get frustrated really quick (adhd symptom I’m pretty sure) but it’s like it’s the end of the world. I have impulse behavior as well, there was this once I had at least 100 dollars on a card, it was spent in less than 15 mins for a game. No thoughts put into my head before I did it. 

Also, my depression and anxiety pretty much just lurks around all the time. My sleep schedule has been pretty much fucked up for the last few weeks or a month I think (my memory is kinda blurry at times), but like I can just be active with only a few hours of sleep (at least 5-7). Even when I don’t get sleep at all, I get a boost of confidence out of nowhere, needing coffee for that boost. Or just finding something to boost confidence. Last thing, I have BAD paranoia. It’s been bad ever since I could remember, even when I was younger, it was bad. But yeah, again I don’t wanna self diagnose myself. I just want to know if I show signs of bipolar I or II.
