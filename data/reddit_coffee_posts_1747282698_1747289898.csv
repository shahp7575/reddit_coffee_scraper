A bit of background. My parents are still together, although more out of convenience than love. They're having severe financial struggles which hasn't helped their relationship and are currently in the process of selling their business property to pay off most of the debt. Mum has had to pick a job up on minimum wage to pay the bills. Dad has MS which affects his speech and hearing but it doesn't have much impact on his mobility. He's currently not working as he's struggling to find work due to his disability. Over the past 10 years or so of him having it we've noticed him getting more introverted and socially awkward. He smokes 60 a day (how he affords this I don't know) and drinks around 15 cups of coffee with 2 sugars a day. Overall a very unhealthy lifestyle. It's also important to note he's been diagnosed with depression, PTSD (from an incident at work), COPD and something else which I can't remember. We've tried helping him and getting the help he needs but he's not willing to help himself and ultimately that has led us to retract back from him. 

A few months ago my sister was helping dad with some stuff on his computer and found naked photos of him. She'd also seen glimpses on his phone of messages to a few different women that were obviously fake accounts of people posing as women. We hoped that his lack of money would mean this sort of thing would have to stop and forgotten about. In a nutshell, we buried our heads in the sand. 

Last night I received 2 dick pics from him with the caption 'Me right now xxx'. I don't need to tell you that they obviously weren't for me. I'm fairly confident they weren't meant for mum as they're under the same roof. Which leads me to thinking he's still doing the online stuff, or having an actual affair. I replied to him telling him that whatever is going on either needs to stop and he needs to speak to mum. He of course said they were meant for mum. 

This has prompted me and my sister to finally have a talk with mum about it. There's no right time to tell her but she has a right to know. There's a scenario where she says she already knows. There's also a scenario where it breaks her. 

Any advice on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1747289697.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1kn16qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kn16qj/i_think_my_neighbor_wants_to_be_a_better_me/,I think my neighbor wants to be a better me…,"This is my throwaway account just in case. 

Let me first start off by saying that I don’t think I’m some gorgeous super model with a fancy life that everyone’s jealous of. I’m a simple girl who prefers solitude to camaraderie and rarely leaves the house except to walk my dog or run errands (work from home, no partner, one best friend). That being said, I do try to be neighborly to an extent, because we do live in a smaller complex and I think it’s important to look out for one another. I’m an introvert, not an asshole. 

More context: I’ve lived in my end unit for about 28 years.

This one particular neighbor moved in about 8 years ago and from the jump they started exhibiting some interesting behaviors. They moved in across the hall from me. It started with her setting up her patio exactly like mine -same patio furniture, same placement for her plant, same lights around the fence. Our patios are small and there’s only so much you can do, so I don’t think much of it. She introduces herself to me one morning as I’m drinking coffee on my patio, commenting how we’re “twins” with our setups. I smiled and said something along the lines of “I guess so” (it was early and I was barely functioning). One day I decided to bleach my hair. Less than a week later, she bleached her hair. I’m not the keeper of bleach and she’s a grown adult. Who cares. Then I went to a swap meet and bought off brand blue adidas sweats, only for her to buy the same colored, brand name adidas sweats a few days later and style it similar to how I did (white sports bra). Adidas is popular, whatever. 

But then things just kept….happening. 

-She wore cutesy outfits. I bought my first pair of Nikes and started dressing in athleisure on my walks. She started wearing athleisure outfits.
-I bought a new black car. She bought a new black car. 
-I grew out my blonde and cut it all off (back to brown) and she professionally died her hair a brown shade similar to my natural color the next day (she showed it off to me in passing, talking about how she finally found a good hairstylist). 
-I started dating. She suddenly had a boyfriend (she was single and very adamant about staying that way). 
-I broke up with my boyfriend and she was broke up with hers same week.
-I thrifted some black velvet dining chairs (she saw me bring them inside) and she went to buy some “luxurious” ones (told me they cost $100+ each). 
- I stopped straightening my hair and let me natural curls heal, she went and got a perm. 
-I painted the back of a Jean jacket at my bestfriends bachelorette party and then she bought a painted jean jacket and sported it around shortly after. 
-I started talking up rollerblading. She started rollerblading in “designer skates”. 

One time she even asked me what theme I was planning for Christmas and I said “winter wonderland” knowing damn well I was going to do full color. This was a mini test to me. She then went and bought an all white tree and displayed it in the window for all to see a few days later, in a similar fashion to how I had showcased mine in the past year. After I set mine up I waited to “showcase” mine through the window until Christmas Eve. Two days later, she came to me almost looking sad (?) saying “I thought you were going to do winter wonderland?”. I told her I changed my mind and she just walked away. 

There have been more instances I’ve noticed but I think you get the picture. It was pretty obvious after some time to the point that even my neighbor casually asked me if we were close friends or something, because we’re always “matching”. 

Now I sit on my patio quite a bit for sunshine and relaxation, and she would often come outside around the same time, which is when I’d notice these things. It’s strange and unusual. I can’t help but feel like she’s copying everything I do and trying to “one up” me. 

Idk, maybe being home most days has finally made me crazy…or maybe she’s just trying to be a better me. 

Leaving this here in case I go missing, you know where to look first (just kidding, I’m into murder mysteries so this is just my dark humor talking). ",1,1747289604.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Hey! I know this is a bit of a niche post, but I’m hoping to connect with other South Asian (Indian) women who might be looking for the same kind of connection. I’m a 26-year-old South Asian woman living in Seattle and just looking to chat and vibe with someone who understands the cultural context, shared experiences, and maybe even the chaotic beauty of growing up Desi.

This doesn’t need to be NSFW — I’m genuinely just looking for some good conversations, friendship, or even someone to rant to about family expectations, Bollywood plot twists, or the eternal chai vs. coffee debate. It also doesn’t have to be local! I’m only looking for online interactions, although big time zone gaps can make it a bit tricky — but I’m happy to work around it if the vibe’s right.

Whether you’re in the U.S. or elsewhere, closeted or out, chatty or introverted — if you’re a fellow Desi woman who’s interested in connecting, I’d love to hear from you!

Drop me a message and let’s talk!

**Why This Pick?**

4 of the last 5 encounters between these two teams have seen 7 runs or less, friends. More recently, the Rangers and the Astros have each cashed the Under in 4 of their last 6 outings. And, I have to say – both Jacob deGrom (2.72 ERA) and Hunter Brown (1.48 ERA) are incredibly capable. It might be a bit of a sweat, but my money's on this game to end 4-3 for *somebody.* Take the Under to cash.

---------------------------------------------------------

So, friend, you think making website costs money? Not always true! A lot of people worry about website cost. But good news! You can design a website for free. Maybe you think it is hard, but it is not. With free tools, anyone can do it. This writing will show you how.

I tell you, designing website for free is real. You can use website builders. These are like building blocks for internet. I will show you easy ways. We talk about using free website builders. We learn about good platforms too. This writing will help you. You will learn the simple way to get your website for zero cost. Get ready to learn how!

How to Design a Website for Free: Using Free Website Builders
-------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so how we make website for free? We use free website builders. These builders make it simple. Think of them like LEGO. You drag and drop things. You do not need to know code. It is very easy.

Many companies give free website builders. They have designs ready. You just pick what you like. Then, you change the words and pictures. You can add more pages. Free builders have limits. Your website might have their name. You cannot use your own domain name always. But it is still good way to start. So many options exist. Try some. See what works for you. It can be fun to try out free website design!

Popular Platforms to Design Your Website for Free
-------------------------------------------------

### Wix Free Plan: Design Your Website with Drag-and-Drop Tools

Wix is very popular. Many people use Wix. It lets you drag and drop. This means you click something. Then, you move it where you want. It is easy to make website look good. Wix has many designs for free. You can change colors. You can add pictures. It is easy to use.

Wix free plan has some limits. Your website will have Wix name. You do not get much space for files. But for start, Wix is good. You learn how to design website. You try different things. When you are ready, you can pay. Then, you get more features. Wix is great place to start your website design. You can start free.

### WordPress.com Free Plan: A Popular Choice for Free Website Design

WordPress.com is another choice. Many people know WordPress. It is used a lot. WordPress.com is different than WordPress.org. WordPress.com takes care of hosting. WordPress.org, you host yourself. It is for little more experience.

With WordPress.com free, you get website. It has WordPress name. You get free themes. Themes are like designs. You can write blog posts. It is good for writing. But free plan has limits. You cannot use own plugins. Plugins add extra things. WordPress.com is good for blogs and simple sites.

The Benefits of Designing a Website for Free
--------------------------------------------

### Cost Savings: Zero Investment to Design Your Website

Main good thing? Free! No need to spend money to design your website. This is big help if you are starting out. You can use that money for other things. Like, maybe advertising or good coffee!

Free website design saves money. You do not pay for designer. You do not pay for special software. You just use what is free. This makes it easy to try ideas. If idea does not work, no money lost. Starting is easy with free website design. Zero investment is the best.

### Ease of Use: Design Your Website Without Coding

Another big plus? Easy to use. I am engineering man but I am no coder. I no need to know code! Free website builders are made simple. You click buttons. You move things. It is all visual. No need to write complicated things.

This is good for people who are not technical. You do not need special skills. You just need little time. And little bit of trying. You can make website look good. Even if you know nothing about code. So, make website without coding is possible!

The Downsides and Limitations of Free Website Design
----------------------------------------------------

Free website design has problems too. You must know problems. Then, you can decide.

First, your website will have builder's name. Like, ""This website is made with Wix."" This does not look professional. Second, you do not get own domain. Domain is like website address. You get something like ""yourname.wix.com."" Not good for business. Third, you cannot always add what you want. Free plans have limits. So, think hard before you choose free.

You have limited storage. This means you cannot upload many pictures. Also, free websites might be slow. This makes people not want to visit. Free is good for start. But think about future. Then, maybe paid is better.

When is Designing a Website for Free the Right Choice?
------------------------------------------------------

### For Personal Projects and Hobbies: Design a Simple Free Website

When is free website good? If you have personal project. Like, you want to share hobby. Maybe you like to cook. You make website with recipes. You do not need to spend money. Free website is okay.

Free website is good for simple things. You want to show pictures of your cat. You want to write about your garden. Then free website is fine. It is easy to setup. You no worry about costs. Just have fun! Share what you like. Then free website does good job.

### To Test an Idea or Learn the Basics of Free Website Design

Also, free website is good for testing. You have idea for business? You not sure if it works? Make free website first. Try it out. See if people like it. If it works, then pay for better website.

Free website is good for learning. You want to know how website works? Try free builder. Learn how to add pages. Learn how to change design. Then, you understand more. When you ready for real website, you know what to do.

Tips for Designing an Effective Free Website
--------------------------------------------

If you make free website, make it good. Here are tips. First, pick good design. Choose something clean. Make it easy for people to read. Second, use good pictures. Pictures make website look nice.

Third, write good words. Tell people what you do. Make it simple to understand. Fourth, make it easy to move around. People must find what they want. Fifth, make sure it works on phone. Many people use phone to look at website. Do these things, your free website will be good.

Conclusion
----------

Friend, free website is possible! Yes, you can. But you must know what it can do. And what it cannot do. Good for start. Good for learning. Think about what you want. Then, decide if free is for you. If you want to try, go ahead. It costs nothing! Make your website today.

After high school, we lost touch for a little bit but a year we graduated, we started hanging out again. A couple months ago she asked me to take her into the city because Joanne’s was closing and they were having a sale (she said she would pay for my gas). Across the street from said Joanne’s was an outdoor mall and I wanted to walk around and see what was over there and when I told her I wanted to go to walk around and shop she looked at me in disgust and kept questioning why I wanted to go. She eventually sighed and agreed. Finally we check out of Joanne’s and finally make it to the outdoor mall and when we were there, I saw a wedding dress shop, and I asked her like like let’s pass by and look at the dresses in the window, and she turns to me and says why? why do you want to look at those dresses. you’re not getting married anytime soon and I was kind of taken a back because it was rude. So I told her I just like looking at them. They’re really cute. In the same shopping area there was a good restaurant and I asked her if she wanted to go eat and she told me no she wanted to go somewhere else which was fine, but I was really looking forward to that restaurant. so later on we get to the restaurant she wanted to go to and she paid for our food and I paid for the drinks and upon leaving I had leftovers and my hands were full and I asked her for the time because I had a date with my long-distance boyfriend (FaceTime call) and she continued to question me asking me. Why do I wanna know the time? And upon going home, she never offered to pay for my gas. Fast-forward to a couple weeks ago, she texted me when I was at work asking if we can hang out so she can vent and I agreed and I told her I get off work at a certain time and she said OK so I end up going to pick her up after I get off work and she starts crying about this guy she was talking to and while crying she asked me if I can take her to work the next day and she would pay for my gas and I said OK yeah that’s fine so when we were hanging out, we stop at a gas station and I was gonna pay for my gas because I assumed she was gonna give me cash the next day but she just pulled out her credit card and put the card in right away when I was going to pay for it so fast-forward to drop her off and I go home instantly fall asleep, cause I had a long day at work, and when I wake up, she sends me at least six voice messages of her basically being cross faded and crying about the situation with the guy. I pick her up for work and she basically tells me that she reached out to another guy she spoke to before and now they’re friends again and she tells me that guy who started talking to again works in the same area I do and I asked her oh what’s his name? Maybe I know him and she turns to me and says none of your business. She’s like not to sound like a bitch or anything, but why do you wanna know? I don’t know why she’s being rude to me, but I haven’t talked to her since that situation because I feel like she treats me unfairly and very rude even when I take her places and try to help, when she asks me to can anyone give advice?

I’ve been interested in law school since high school and in the last 18 or so months have decided I’d like to pursue a career in Big Law. 

I’ve networked with dozens of individuals in the industry, most just informative phone calls or zooms, but some have led to real relationships (Going to lunch, coffee, etc.).

I have consistently been reading this subreddit for the last year or so and in a recent networking phone call with an associate at a big firm, I found myself zoning out and losing interest. This was because I was asking questions I already knew the answer to, in part due to the fact that I’d already read about it on here or another platform. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is I feel that I may be psyching myself out or getting ahead of myself by trying to learn too much about big law when in reality I have so much in front of me before a career in the field would even start (Keeping my grades up for the rest of undergrad, securing my postgrad job, getting a high LSAT score, getting into a good law school, getting good grades in law school). 

I find the Big Law industry fascinating and I enjoy reading about it in the news, listening to podcasts discussing it, reading this subreddit.

By morning, I received a call from an unfamiliar number.   
""Isabella Bennett, marry me.""   
Hearing that nonchalant tone, I instantly pictured the man.  
The very Playboy my boyfriend's precious was supposed to marry.   
""Your fiancé stole my bride,"" he laughed with mischief.   
""So I'm here to steal his. So fair, right?""   
I finally received the long-awaited proposal.  
But not from the man I’d been waiting seven years for.  
I wiped away the last tear and said calmly, ""I am willing to marry you.""  
  
Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.  
  
It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.   
  
Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.    
  
Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.  
  
But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.  
  
Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.  
  
Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne—every gesture screaming old money and privilege.  
  
She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.  
  
And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.  
  
Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.  
  
Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.  
  
Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.  
  
Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.  
  
The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.   
  
The next day, Chloe flew off to France.   
  
Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.  
  
That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.  
  
His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot—like an abandoned dog.  
  
She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.   
  
""Who are you?""  
  
""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""  
  
He didn't remember at all.  
  
But he let her take him home anyway.  
  
That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.  
  
Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram—  
  
A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.  
  
The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.  
  
Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.  
  
But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.  
  
He never forgot Chloe.  
  
She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.  
  
Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.  
  
She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.   
  
During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.  
  
Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.  
  
She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.  
  
Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.  
  
Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.  
  
And everything went back to square one.  
  
He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.   
  
He’d throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.   
  
And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.  
  
Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""  
  
Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.  
  
Isabella stood up and started packing.  
  
One by one, everything went into garbage bags.  
  
The garbage truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck—along with seven years of foolish dreams.  
  
""What are you throwing away?""  
  
The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.  
  
Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless stuff.”  
  
Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn’t matter anymore.”  
  
Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.  
  
""Who gave you permission to touch my things?!""  
  
He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.  
  
After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.  
  
As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.  
  
She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.  
  
Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.  
  
Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life—  
  
Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia—was on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through garbage.  
  
Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.   
  
“The garbage truck already took everything. It’s at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine—I probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I’m... I’m sorry.”  
  
Only then did Dominic notice her injury.  
  
He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn’t mean to.""  
  
Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""  
  
Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.

News isn't just information; it’s a connection. It helps us understand not only our own communities but the broader world we live in. In today’s fast-paced digital age, a reliable [news portal](https://www.updatesfeed.com/) is more than a source of updates it’s a window to global awareness. 

As our lives become increasingly connected through technology, travel, and trade, global events have a direct impact on our daily routines. A policy shift in Europe, a health update in Asia, or a market movement in the U.S. can influence how businesses, prices, and even public opinion evolve here at home. That’s why it’s so important to not only stay updated with [India news](https://www.updatesfeed.com/), but also stay tuned in to what’s happening beyond our borders. A well-rounded perspective leads to better decision-making and broader thinking. 

Global news also fosters empathy and understanding. Reading stories from different parts of the world helps us appreciate cultures, struggles, and victories that may be far from our own, yet surprisingly relatable. A thoughtfully curated news portal doesn’t just report it helps us learn, relate, and grow as global citizens. When combined with national stories, it gives a full view of the issues that shape our world. 

Informed individuals build stronger societies. Whether it’s following India news for national updates or exploring international headlines for context, staying connected to trustworthy global news is key to being prepared, proactive, and aware. In a time where narratives shift quickly, having access to accurate and balanced reporting through a trusted portal isn’t just helpful it’s empowering. ",1,1747288207.0,newsindia,0,1.0,False

I noticed nausea from the start, no different on 5 vs 10mg. I have mostly taken it with brekky in the morning, and the nausea was there but definitely manageable, just uncomfortable. Definitely can't handle a large brekky, don't want a milky coffee in the morning any more, and generally feel overfull/burpy until about midday. Never had any vomiting or anything, just felt generally woozy/unwell in the stomach, perhaps 2-3/10, if 10 was crippling pain.

I tried to pin down an amount or timing of food to have to reduce the nausea, but it seems completely random. Some days I'd feel fine and none at all, but most days it's that 2-3/10 level until after lunch.

I switched my dose timing to just before bed, two nights ago (delayed the brekky dose til bedtime on the first day of the switch). First night was fine, sleep was fine. But this morning I felt nauseous at the gym just after waking up - almost exactly the same feeling as I was getting in the mornings.

So my question: has anyone else had this kind, where some days you get nauseous and others there's none at all? I've tried to figure out the pattern or trigger, but I can't for the life of me!",1,1747288126.0,trintellix,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
For three years, Adira had been secretly dating her brother's best friend. On their anniversary, she deliberately canceled a company meeting and picked out his favorite watch, planning to surprise him.  
  
Little did she know that instead of giving him a surprise, she'd be the one receiving a shocking ""gift.""  
  
With her own eyes, she watched as Damon embraced another girl as they entered a hotel, while her brother Liam followed behind trying to stop him.  
  
""Damon, what about your girlfriend?"" Liam asked. ""You've been dating for three years without introducing her to anyone, and now you're taking your ex to a hotel?""  
  
Damon glanced at the woman in his arms and replied in a husky voice, ""Zoe was drugged. She needs someone to help her through it, and I can't give her to another man. As for that girlfriend... don't worry about her. I only dated her because she reminds me of Zoe.""  
  
Adira stood frozen, the words hitting her like lightning.  
  
\*I'm just a replacement?\*  
  
Before she could process this revelation, her brother's incredulous voice continued, ""What? A replacement? I don't get it, man. With your looks, you could have any woman. Why are you still hung up on Zoe? She pursued you in high school, but you're the one who can't move on. It's been years, and now you're playing replacement games?""  
  
Seeing his words had no effect, Liam shook his head. ""Whatever. I'm meeting my sister. Do what you want, but don't regret it later.""  
  
As Liam left, Damon looked down at the semi-conscious Zoe in his arms. She was restlessly pressing against his chest, her fingers randomly tugging at his shirt collar.  
  
He gently restrained her wrists and whispered, ""Hang on, baby. I'll take care of you soon.""  
  
Hearing this, Adira's face turned deathly pale, her fingers digging sharply into her palm.  
  
When the door closed behind them, Adira watched in shock as Damon kissed Zoe with a tenderness he'd never shown her.  
  
She remembered how rough and impatient he'd been with her just the night before, even tearing buttons from her nightgown. She had naively thought it was just youthful passion. But now she understood—it wasn't youth, it was indifference.  
  
""So good..."" Zoe's soft voice drifted through the door.  
  
Damon's voice was raspy with emotion: ""If it feels good, don't leave me again.""  
  
A violent pain seized Adira's chest, like an axe cleaving her open, leaving her raw and bleeding. Unable to bear it any longer, she turned away with trembling shoulders.  
  
Somehow she made it back to her car. With shaking hands, she started the engine and floored the accelerator. As the speedometer hit 75 mph and wind rushed through the open windows, she couldn't escape the suffocating agony in her chest.  
  
Through tear-blurred vision, she recalled the first time she met Damon.  
  
Three years ago, her car had crashed into an overpass. The vehicle was crushed, leaking fuel, ready to explode any moment. Everyone stayed back, afraid to approach. As she lay trapped inside, drifting in and out of consciousness, believing she would die, someone suddenly yanked open the door.  
  
A young man in a black windbreaker pulled her out without hesitation.  
  
All she remembered afterward was the explosion and a button clutched in her hand.  
  
She dreamed of that silhouette countless times, her heart racing each time.  
  
Until one day, while picking up Liam, she saw Damon wearing that same windbreaker. She thought she'd found her rescuer.  
  
Though she was three years older than him, with her looks, wealth, and figure, Adira had never lacked admirers. Yet for him, she pursued a younger man for the first time—brought him breakfast, attended his games, stayed up all night when he had a fever. Even during her company's IPO, she abandoned billion-dollar projects to celebrate their anniversary.  
  
Eventually, he agreed to date her, but insisted they keep it secret.  
  
She thought he was just nervous about explaining it to Liam.  
  
She thought his cold demeanor merely masked shyness.  
  
She thought...  
  
It was all just her assumptions.  
  
She was merely a replacement.  
  
Adira trembled, biting her lip until she tasted blood.  
  
As her car screeched to a halt at her home, she saw Liam standing by the door with a gift box.  
  
""Sis, you're finally back!"" Liam approached, holding the package. ""My friend who's going abroad today asked me to give you this.""  
  
Adira forced herself to remain composed. ""Your friend is giving me a gift? I don't even know him.""  
  
Liam looked surprised. ""Seriously, sis? He's the one who saved you from that car crash. Don't be so ungrateful!""  
  
Adira froze. ""What? The person who saved me... wasn't Damon?""  
  
""Who told you it was Damon?"" Liam's eyes widened in confusion.  
  
""I remember my rescuer wore a black windbreaker, just like Damon's...""  
  
""Oh, that jacket. They both had the same style. Damon wasn't even there that day. It was Carson who ran in to save you.""  
  
Adira's mind went blank. So she had mistaken the identity of her rescuer all along?  
  
The person who made her heart race was never Damon, but was Carson?  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Adira suddenly recalled her first meeting with Carson.  
  
She had been pursuing Damon at the time. One night, learning he was drunk, she drove through a snowstorm to pick him up. When she pushed open the door to the private room, her first sight wasn't Damon but another young man.  
  
Carson was sitting in the corner. When she entered, he stood up abruptly, spilling red wine down his shirt.  
  
He had eyes completely different from Damon's—gentle, like they contained an entire galaxy.  
  
He looked at her for a long time before simply saying, ""Adira. Nice to meet you.""  
  
She found it peculiar that he didn't address her as ""sis"" despite being younger, thinking him slightly presumptuous. Looking back now, what emotions had been hidden in that gaze?  
  
Adira took a deep breath, her fingertips trembling slightly. ""Wait, let me process this.""  
  
Liam looked confused. ""Sis, what's wrong?""  
  
Before she could answer, he continued with a smile, ""Don't worry about it. You're gorgeous—all my friends have crushes on you, including my super-aloof buddy Carson.""  
  
""Of course, except for Damon. That guy's obsessed with his former flame; no one else exists for him.""  
  
Adira closed her eyes, gripping the gift box tightly in her hands, no longer concerned about his final comment. Instead, her mind was filled with one revelation:  
  
So Carson likes her too?  
  
Her heart suddenly began to race. She looked up and asked hoarsely, ""You mentioned Carson's going abroad? Which country?""  
  
""England, for his doctorate."" Liam scratched his head. ""He was supposed to leave three years ago, but for some reason he delayed until now.""  
  
Three years ago—right when she had frantically searched for her rescuer after the accident.  
  
Adira clutched the box tighter, her nails nearly digging into her palm.  
  
""Nothing else. I'm heading out."" Liam turned to leave.  
  
""Wait."" Adira called after him. ""The family business needs your attention now. You'll take over the domestic operations, while I expand into international markets.""  
  
""What?!"" Liam's eyes widened. ""That's so sudden! I'm not ready!""  
  
Adira gave a faint smile. ""No time for preparation. I'm leaving here in two weeks...""  
  
\*To chase after Carson!\*  
  
She kept the last sentence to herself, merely gripping the gift box tighter.  
  
After Liam left complaining, Adira entered the mansion and pulled out an enormous suitcase. She began sorting through everything connected to Damon.  
  
Each item represented her desperate attempts to win his affection—the limited-edition mechanical keyboard she'd pulled strings to acquire, the sneakers he'd mentioned liking once, which she'd queued overnight to purchase, the wristband he'd worn during a match, which she'd secretly kept…  
  
She organized everything through the night. By dawn, all these memories were packed into cardboard boxes.  
  
As she carried a box downstairs, she froze—Damon had returned.  
  
He stood in the entryway, his black shirt partially unbuttoned revealing a pale collarbone, his hair falling over his brow, making his narrow eyes appear even more intense.  
  
He looked up at her with mild surprise. ""Adira? You're up early?""  
  
After three years, despite their romantic relationship, he still addressed her formally. If not for their intimate nights, she would have doubted they were dating at all.  
  
Now she realized those nights of intense possession were likely because she resembled his precious ex-girlfriend.  
  
Adira didn't answer his question, but countered with her own: ""What about you? You didn't come home all night.""  
  
Damon seemed to recall something pleasant, his lips curving into a half-smile. ""Had something to take care of.""  
  
In their three years together, she rarely saw him genuinely smile. When he did smirk, it was with a roguish curve that never reached his eyes.  
  
But this time, his happiness was authentic. And his ""something to take care of"" was sleeping with Zoe.  
  
Strangely, her heart—which had been torn apart yesterday—now felt inexplicably calm.  
  
She could only feel grateful that she'd discovered her mistake and recognized the wrong man, so her pain was gone too.  
  
She simply replied, ""Oh,"" and continued toward the door with the box.  
  
Damon finally noticed something was amiss.  
  
Yesterday was their anniversary, he hadn't come home, and hadn't even called. Yet Adira showed... no reaction?  
  
He frowned slightly, instinctively reaching out to stop her. ""Sorry about missing our anniversary. I'll make it up to you today.""  
  
Adira pulled away from his grasp. ""No need.""  
  
But he seemed unsettled by her coldness, and uncharacteristically insisted: ""No, I will make it up to you.""  
  
Perhaps feeling guilty about yesterday, Damon was unusually patient. He took her to all the places she'd mentioned wanting to visit—They rode the Ferris wheel at an amusement park, ate at a candlelit dinner in an upscale restaurant. He even made the unprecedented gesture of accompanying her shopping, buying her a diamond necklace.  
  
Adira was about to refuse when her phone rang—a bar manager called to say she'd left something at the club.  
  
She acknowledged it, and Damon, continuing his atypical behavior, offered to drive her there himself.  
  
After retrieving her belongings, just as they were leaving, a soft, feminine voice called out from behind.  
  
""Damon, what a coincidence!""  
  
Adira turned to see a beautiful woman with an innocent face. Zoe approached in a flowing blue dress, her gaze lingering briefly on Adira before smiling at Damon. ""Who's this?""  
  
Damon seemed surprised to encounter her here. After a moment's hesitation, he answered, ""Liam's sister, Adira.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Once again, he concealed their relationship just like every time before.  
  
""We're having a party inside. Why don't you both join us?"" Zoe enthusiastically invited.  
  
Adira didn't want to go, but Damon had already nodded in agreement.  
  
The dim lights and pulsing music of the private room created an intimate atmosphere.  
  
As soon as Adira entered, she drew countless gazes. Naturally stunning, she wore a figure-hugging dress that accentuated her slender waist and porcelain skin.  
  
Several men immediately surrounded her, asking for her number.  
  
In the past, Adira would never have obliged. But today, she smiled and agreed to each request.  
  
Damon sat in the corner, brows furrowed, watching her intently.  
  
Zoe's expression soured. She pouted, ""Haven't you all forgotten this is my welcome-back party?""  
  
The others quickly smoothed things over: ""Let's play a game!""  
  
The bottle spun and landed on Zoe.  
  
""The loser has to kiss someone of the opposite sex!"" someone teased.  
  
Zoe's eyes darted toward Damon, but ultimately she pointed to the guy beside him. ""I pick him.""  
  
Just as she was about to kiss him—  
  
CRASH!  
  
Damon kicked over the coffee table. Amid shattering glass, he grabbed Zoe's wrist and stormed out.  
  
The room fell silent.  
  
Adira picked up her purse, smiling as she stood. ""I have something to attend to, so I'll be leaving.""  
  
In the corridor around the corner, she heard heated arguing.  
  
""What's your problem?"" Damon's voice was tight with restrained fury. ""I'm right here, and you're about to kiss another man! What was that night about, then? Am I just your backup?""  
  
Zoe sounded hurt. ""I was just testing if you still cared about me...""  
  
""I don't care about you?"" Damon's voice strained with emotion. ""Zoe, I dream about getting back together with you. How can you say I don't care?""  
  
Zoe's voice softened. ""I didn't mean it like that... Look, we can get back together, but after all this time, I'm afraid you don't love me like before. So, you need to agree to three conditions.""  
  
Damon, typically defiant and unbridled, now found himself gritting his teeth in surrender before the girl's increasingly unreasonable demands. ""What conditions? Tell me.""  
  
""First,"" Zoe paused, ""I want you to break one of your ribs and make it into a necklace for me.""  
  
Adira stopped in her tracks. Is this how young people date now? Such an outrageous request—surely Damon would refuse?  
  
But the next moment, Damon turned and walked away.  
  
Adira followed him out only to see him get into his car and deliberately crash into a tree!  
  
BOOM!  
  
After the deafening impact, the world seemed to pause for a second.  
  
Then came screams, calls for police, ambulance sirens. When paramedics pulled Damon's bloodied body from the wrecked car, he used his last consciousness to say:  
  
""My rib... it's broken... during surgery... take it out...""  
  
Adira stood at a distance, silently watching this scene unfold.  
  
She couldn't help but smile.  
  
He must truly love Zoe.  
  
Fine, this was for the best.  
  
After she's gone, they can finally be together.

In this space, Dr. Roman pours Mashu a coffee. Mashu asks if this is a dream, but Dr. Roman says that this is more like a hallucination than a dream. He states that Mashu collapsed in the library and if she continues to stay collapsed, then she’ll most likely die, but he is in no position to make statements like that. Dr. Roman explains that “he” does not exist, but is rather an image of how Mashu perceives Dr. Roman.



Dr. Roman gets to the point of the entire conversation. “What does Mashu want to do?”, Dr. Roman asks. Of course, Mashu wants to protect Chaldea and everyone else, but she is afraid of Galahad’s shield rejecting her. Mashu feels like she’s always going to return to this room, but Dr. Roman says that she won’t because she no longer sees the world as an equal.



**Dr. Roman:**

>Humans are beings that strive to be equal, yet are never equal themselves.

>There are people who consider prioritizing their lives as secondary. Isn’t that not equal at that point?

>That might not be right. No, that could be a bad thing.

>Inequality creates disparity, disparity creates competition, and competition creates conflict.

>There’ve never been wars throughout history that’ve been fought for the sole reason that **we are different**.

>…However, Mashu. Inequality is a global issue.

>If individuals bear that responsibility for themselves, it can’t be called inequality.

Dr. Roman says that Mashu can love other people other than herself. He puts you, the Master, as a prime example, where you’ll fight for what you believe in and stand in front for those you care about. Mashu focuses on the aspect of being fair on Galahad’s behalf, but Dr. Roman says that Galahad isn’t far because he’s siding with her right now. So Mashu can love anyone and gain free inequality without having to stick to fairness. Mashu also states that the shield is rusting away. Dr. Roman responds by saying that she’s been able to fight with her own strength.



**Dr. Roman:**

>It doesn’t matter if the shield has given up on you. You should just throw that shield away.

>It’s fine to be more free and confident, Mashu. Don’t be trapped in the concept of a Shielder.

>Your powers are not completely gone. That’s how Marisbury designed you.

>Sorry, but no matter how you look at it, the power of a Demi-Servant is your trait.

>It must be painful to acknowledge that. That you’re different from others.

>But you know I don’t need to tell you the ways of utilizing it, right?

>At the very least— Your heart desires to keep running.



Dr. Roman asks if Mashu remembers her diagnosis after Traum. Dr. Roman informs Mashu that she will no longer be a “Demi” if she seeks more power than she has now, but that’s what Mashu needs. However, Mashu has a different desire that is different from what Ruler and Shielder desires. She desires to protect Master, Chaldea, and Pan-Human History from all and every injustice. That is what gives her reason and purpose to fight. Dr. Roman fully supports that idea.



**Dr. Roman:**

>So this is the beginning and the end of everything, huh. My. Fate is a mysterious thing.

>Now then. Do “you” have anything to say? Or do “I” leave it at that?

**???:**

>—Just one thing.

>Mashu. Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty.  You can start doing **whatever** you want.

>Don’t let the shield control you, you control the shield. You have the right to do that.

>And sometimes you’ll have to put down the shield to pick up the sword. That is what fighting is about.

>When you embody that, you’ll no longer be a Shielder. You’ll be different from the Heroic Spirit Galahad.

>That’s why this Class is…this Class is… Woah, what do you think it should be!?



**Dr. Roman:**

>—Obviously it has to be ■■■■■■■.

>After all, she was recognized as a **Sir** by that exemplary knight.



**???:**

>So the thing after the Sixth Singularity! I’ve been fantasising about this one all on my own, how did you know!?

**Mashu:**

>Did you really come up with this wonderful Class name!?

>Thank you very much! I’ll cherish it very much, no, I’ll proudly take it on!



**???:**

>Woah…you’re extremely happy about it…

>Well no matter, this is just me living up to the attending physician role! So go look cool out there, Mashu!



**Dr. Roman:**

>…Sorry, but time’s almost up. I won’t say farewell.

>I don't have anything left to say. Leave this room as you wish.



**Mashu:**

>Yes—I will! Take care, Doctor!

>Also, you both seemed to get along well!

The Noble Phantasm is collapsing. Metatron Jeanne tells Mashu that she’d have a slim chance at winning even if she did awaken **that Class**. Mashu is content with that because her odds are not completely 0. Metatron states that her outside self is currently prioritizing the future rather than the past which has already perished.

Kadoc is surprised that her Class has changed as well as her Saint Graph value. He states that Da Vinci would fall off her chair if she saw this. Moriarty and Dante have been awaiting her return and are surprised that she is now a Paladin (Holy Knight). Metatron commends Mashu for deflecting her Noble Phantasm but has an infinite supply of them, so she can always play the long game if need be.

I keep seeing phrases like:
	•	“Don’t worry, they’ll be out soon”
	•	“They act like animals”
	•	“Just wait until Bushwick is fully gentrified—hang in there”

Let’s be real: these comments are loaded with racist undertones, whether people realize it or not. OPs will post about noise, neighbors, or uncomfortable situations, and the replies immediately jump to coded language that dehumanizes long-time residents—without even mentioning race explicitly. The implications are clear.

For context: I’m a 30-year-old Latino/Jewish law student, born and raised in Bushwick. I’ve been fortunate—my family still owns our home here & I went to private school (NYC schools weren’t doing too hot 25 years ago), I exist at a socio-economic level that fits into the “new Bushwick.” I am part of it. And yet, if I run out in sweats to grab a coffee, people sometimes slow their speech or assume I don’t speak English. That says a lot.

I recently saw a neighbor-led street cleanup, which is great in theory—but not a single Latino person was there, despite Bushwick being a historically Latino neighborhood. That’s not collaboration; that’s segregation dressed up as community effort. It’s not supporting local businesses, it’s building a separate economy and identity on top of the existing one.

There’s a growing “us vs. them” dynamic that’s really sad. No one really hates each other, but assumptions run deep on both sides. People feel misunderstood, unwelcome, or even unsafe in their own neighborhood.

Gentrification doesn’t have to mean erasure. If you move into a neighborhood with a rich cultural history, be a part of it. Learn, listen, show up. Don’t build another bubble on top of the one already here.

Essential Features to Look for When Buying a Barndominium in a Rural Setting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buying a barndominium in a rural setting can be an exciting venture. These unique structures blend the charm of traditional barns with the comforts of a modern home. As you explore options for barndominiums, it’s crucial to consider essential features that will enhance your living experience and meet your needs. Here are some critical aspects to keep in mind during your search.

### Spacious Layout

One of the primary attractions of a barndominium is its spacious design. Look for a layout that suits your lifestyle. Open floor plans are popular, providing flexibility for family gatherings, entertaining guests, or simply enjoying your personal space. Make sure there are enough bedrooms and bathrooms to accommodate your family and any visitors. A good amount of storage space is also essential. Consider built-in cabinetry and walk-in closets to keep your home organized.

### Quality Materials

The materials used in the construction of a barndominium affect durability, maintenance, and insulation. Here are some key materials to consider:

- **Insulation:** Ensure the building has high-quality insulation to keep your home comfortable and energy-efficient.
- **Exterior Finishes:** Look for materials like metal siding or wood that offer both aesthetic appeal and durability.
- **Roofing:** A sturdy roof is essential. Metal roofs are popular for their long lifespan and low maintenance.

### Energy Efficiency

In today's eco-conscious world, energy efficiency is more important than ever. Check for energy-efficient windows and appliances that reduce electricity consumption. Solar panels are also a great feature to consider, providing renewable energy and lowering your utility bills. A properly insulated barndominium will ensure that your heating and cooling costs stay manageable, making your rural retreat comfortable year-round.

### Functional Kitchen

The kitchen is the heart of any home. When searching for a barndominium, look for a functional kitchen that meets your cooking and entertaining needs. Key features include:

- Ample counter space for meal preparation.
- High-quality appliances that make cooking enjoyable.
- An efficient layout that allows for easy movement during cooking.

### Outdoor Space

Living in a rural area often means you’ll have ample outdoor space. Is the barndominium equipped with a porch or patio that allows you to enjoy the beautiful surroundings? This extra space can be perfect for relaxing, gardening, or hosting summer barbecues. A large yard also opens opportunities for outdoor activities, whether it's gardening, raising animals, or simply enjoying nature.

### Location Considerations

Choosing the right location for your barndominium is just as important as the structure itself. Remember to consider:

- **Proximity to Amenities:** While you may love rural life, ensure you have access to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, and healthcare.
- **Access to Transportation:** Evaluate the accessibility of major roads or highways for commuting and travel.
- **Community Feel:** Investigate the local community to ensure it aligns with your lifestyle. Engage with neighbors, join local events, and explore local resources.

### Customizable Spaces

One of the benefits of barndominiums is their adaptability. Look for options that allow you to customize spaces according to your preferences. Whether you envision a home office, art studio, or fitness area, having the flexibility to design your interiors will tailor the barndominium to fit your life.

### Safety Features

Ensure that safety features are integrated into your barndominium. Look for fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors, particularly in areas like the kitchen and near sleeping spaces. Additionally, assess the property’s surrounding area for any potential hazards. A safe environment contributes significantly to your overall peace of mind.

Buying a barndominium in a rural setting is about creating a space that feels like home. By focusing on these essential features, you can find a barndominium that not only meets your practical needs but also complements your lifestyle. With the right approach, your dream of rural living can become a reality.

### Conclusion

The allure of white barndominiums for sale lies in their unique ability to blend modern design with rustic charm. Their sleek appearance and open-concept layouts appeal to those seeking a contemporary lifestyle, while the rural setting provides a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. As you explore these stunning homes, consider the essential features that can enhance your living experience. Look for spacious interiors, energy-efficient systems, and customizable spaces that reflect your personal taste and functional needs.

These homes not only promise comfort and style but also offer a connection to the natural surroundings. With their versatile structures, white barndominiums can serve as serene retreats, vibrant family hubs, or hobbyist havens. Choosing the right barndominium in a rural area can be a rewarding journey, ensuring that you find a space that meets both your practical requirements and aesthetic desires.

Chapter 1  
  
I became Mrs. Sinclair when the F1 legend married me as revenge on so-called true love.  
  
For three years, Kailen and Ruby couldn't stay away from each other. Lingering touches during press events, inside jokes in interviews that made headlines the next day.  
  
My Instagram comments were brutal: ""She's just the stand-in."" ""Poor girl doesn't realize she's the backup plan.""  
  
I never made scenes. Just smiled for the cameras, told reporters ""we're very happy"" when they asked about the latest photos of Kailen and Ruby at some rooftop bar.  
  
Then I got pregnant. I terminated without telling him.  
  
When he found out, Kailen's face went white, then red. He slammed his fist against the wall of our Malibu home.  
  
""What the hell were you thinking?"" His voice broke.  
  
""Why would you do that?""  
  
I touched his face—the same jawline as his brother's—and said quietly, ""Because this was never real, Kailen.""  
  
The truth hung between us.  
  
""I can't have a baby with someone I don't love.""  
  
His eyes widened as he finally understood.  
  
""It was always Jayden for me. It's always been Jayden.""  
  
\--  
  
Everyone knew Kailen Sinclair only married me to make Ruby Miller jealous.  
  
They'd broken up before the wedding, with Ruby storming off to Europe out of jealousy.  
  
Kailen didn't chase after her—instead, he put a ring on my finger.  
  
I walked down the aisle in a designer dress that never felt like mine, marrying a man whose heart belonged to someone else.  
  
The gossip sites all predicted the same ending: ""Once Ruby returns, he'll dump her faster than a pit stop tire change.""  
  
But something unexpected happened in our third year of marriage. Kailen seemed to actually fall for me.  
  
He'd bring me coffee in bed, kiss me awake on lazy Sundays, and smile when I'd playfully demand his attention.  
  
During our most intimate moments, tangled in our sheets, he'd whisper against my skin, ""Sweetheart, let's have a baby. A sweet one, just like you.""  
  
We began feeling like any normal couple in love.  
  
Until the day I found out I was pregnant.  
  
Before I could tell Kailen, Ruby Miller came back to the States.  
  
And just like that, they got back together.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
It happened to be the day their Harvard reunion at some overpriced Manhattan bar the night Ruby Miller came back to the State.  
  
Everyone was gossiping about how her family's tech empire had collasped overnight. She was apparently desperate for cash.  
  
When Kailen guided me through the crowd, we spotted Blake Reynolds—heir to Reynolds Petroleum—shoving drinks toward Ruby at the bar.  
  
""Another shot equals another hundred grand loan,"" Blake drawled, his Rolex glinting under the lights. ""Simple math, sweetheart.""  
  
Ruby's mascara streaked as she choked down each burning shot, maintaining that beauty queen smile even as her eyes watered.  
  
When she spotted Kailen, her composure cracked. She stared down at her empty glass like it was suddenly the most fascinating thing in the room.  
  
""Well, if it isn't America's fastest man!"" someone called out. ""Ruby, why bother with Blake's pocket change? Your ex is worth what—half a billion now?""  
  
""I bet one night in Sinclair's bed would solve all your financial problems,"" another voice jeered.  
  
Kailen took a long drag of his cigarette, his expression bored, but I felt his muscles tense against me.  
  
""Keep talking and you'll be drinking through a straw tomorrow,"" he said flatly, resting his arm around my shoulders. ""And anyone who makes my wife uncomfortable can get the fuck out.""  
  
The crowd laughed nervously, calling me ""Mrs. Champion"" and commenting on how protective Kailen seemed.  
  
None of them knew he'd only shown up tonight after seeing Ruby's name on the RSVP list.  
  
Ruby glared at me, her knuckles white around her glass.  
  
Blake's hand slid down her back. ""Guess the racing superstar's moved on,"" he smirked. ""But I'm still buying what you're selling.""  
  
""Strip for me tonight, and I'll write you a check that'll keep those creditors away for a month. Small price for damaged goods, right?""  
  
The ash from Kailen's cigarette fell as his jaw clenched. To anyone else, he looked merely annoyed. But I recognized the cold fury building behind his eyes—the same look he got before a dangerous overtake on the track.  
  
Ruby looked up at Kailen, her gaze steady despite her tears. ""Not interested,"" she said, voice barely audible over the music.  
  
""I've only ever loved one man,"" she continued. ""Even if he's forgotten me, I won't let anyone else have what was his.""  
  
Kailen's fingers dug into my hand so hard I nearly gasped.  
  
Blake laughed, running his hand through his slicked-back hair. ""Playing hard to get with a foreclosure notice? That's fucking rich,"" he sneered. ""Tell yourself whatever fairy tale you want—you're coming home with me tonight, princess. Consider it charity work.""  
  
He grabbed Ruby's wrist, dragging her stumbling figure toward the exit. She tried pushing him away, but the alcohol had taken its toll.  
  
Kailen's eyes tracked her every movement. His breathing had changed—shallow and quick, like before a crash.  
  
Just before they reached the door, something in Kailen snapped.  
  
He moved with the same precision that had made him legendary on the track. Three strides, then his fist connected with Blake's jaw with a sickening crack.  
  
Blake hit the floor. Kailen was on him instantly, pinning him with a knee to the chest.  
  
""Touch her again and I'll break every fucking bone in your hands,"" he snarled, landing another punch. ""You'll never sign another check in your life.""  
  
People scrambled for their phones. I rushed over and grabbed Kailen's arm, feeling the tremors of rage running through him.  
  
""Kailen, stop—you're going to kill him,"" I whispered urgently.  
  
He turned to me, and in that moment, I was looking at a stranger. ""Back off,"" he said coldly. ""This isn't your business.""  
  
I froze, the wedding ring suddenly heavy on my finger.  
  
Ruby threw herself between them, her perfectly manicured nails clutching Kailen's bloodied knuckles. ""Please stop,"" she begged, tears flowing freely now. ""Your hands—your career—don't ruin everything because of me.""  
  
""I thought... I was so afraid you really didn't care anymore..."" Her voice broke, the strong facade crumbling completely.  
  
Kailen didn't hesitate. He wrapped his arms around her, shielding her from the crowd's stares and camera phones.  
  
Everyone watched in silence as America's racing legend walked out with the girl he'd never gotten over.  
  
I stood alone in a room full of people, holding my clutch purse and the shattered pieces of my marriage.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Kailen never came home that night.  
  
At 3 AM, Ruby posted on X: ""You said you'd never hold anyone else's hand again.""  
  
The photo showed interlaced fingers, with the unmistakable birthmark on the man's hand—Kailen's distinctive freckle that racing fans recognized from a thousand podium photos.  
  
And just like that, I became the ""anyone else"" whose hand he would no longer hold.  
  
Within ten minutes, #SinclairAffair was trending.  
  
Ruby's supporters flooded her comments: ""Get your man back, girl! You two were ALWAYS endgame! ?""  
  
""Screw loyalty—I'm Team Kailen Cheating if it means watching Vivia's fake ass get dumped lmaooo""  
  
People were grabbing popcorn, waiting for my public meltdown.  
  
A few loyal fans defended him: ""That's not Kailen's hand, right? u/KailenSinclair your wife has supported you through everything. Don't throw away what you have, man.""  
  
Our joint sponsorships were worth millions—Rolex, Tiffany, that stupid kitchen appliance campaign where we pretended to make breakfast together. The contract penalties alone would bankrupt most small countries.  
  
When our agent couldn't reach Kailen, she called me in a panic: ""Post something, anything! Make it look like you're together. We need damage control NOW.""  
  
I scrolled through my camera roll, realizing how few photos we actually had together. In the rare ones that existed, I was always the only one smiling.  
  
Finally, I posted an old picture of Kailen reading at home, bathed in warm lamplight. He looked just like Jayden in that moment—same profile, same furrowed brow of concentration that had made me fall for the wrong brother years ago.  
  
Comments immediately flooded in:  
  
""See? The champ's at HOME with his WIFE! Anyone saying otherwise can catch these hands! ?""  
  
Everyone started trashing Ruby, calling her an attention-seeking liar.  
  
Until Kailen himself retweeted Ruby's post five minutes later.  
  
Under that damning photo of their intertwined hands, he wrote simply: ""Yes, that's me.""  
  
Just like that, he publicly acknowledged their reunion while exposing my pathetic attempt at covering for him.  
  
Once again, he'd thrown me away for Ruby Miller.  
  
Her fans invaded my mentions: ""Caught in 4K trying to fake your marriage lmaooo get rekt Vivia ?""  
  
""Three years and you couldn't keep your man. Pathetic.""  
  
Who said I ever wanted Kailen's heart in the first place?  
  
I deleted every trace of him from my phone.  
  
Divorce papers suddenly seemed long overdue.

1kn0lec,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1kn0lec/home_school_or_not_gifted_autistic_1st_grader/,Home School or Not? Gifted Autistic 1st Grader.,"We need to decide within the next month whether to homeschool our soon-to-be 1st grader.

**Background:**  
Our son started kindergarten at a great public school last fall and did well for the first month, but then became very dysregulated and aggressive (mostly toward peers), to the point that he couldn't remain in class. While he'd shown similar behaviors in preschool, this was more extreme. A rushed neuropsych evaluation diagnosed him with autism and a high IQ (138). We believe the school environment and social demands overwhelmed him—especially without a trusted adult to help co-regulate. Four after school nannies quit due to his behavior which became severe due to the stress of his school day, so I now care for him in the afternoons which is not all that easy with my job. We stayed in school because the staff responded with really wonderful support, including a 1:1 aide, and his school behavior improved immediately. We just signed an IEP for 1st grade that reduces this support to a shared aide for about half the day (down from roughly ¾ of the day with a 1:1).

**Reasons to Stay in School:**

* He’s developed a strong connection to his school and feels proud to be part of the community.
* Developmentally, he may be more ready for school in 1st grade than he was for kindergarten.
* I’m unsure I’d be a great teacher. I have ADHD, struggle with organization, and am not especially social.
* He started K without any academic background and is now breezily meeting standards. Academics are going fine. 
* My job is demanding, though flexible. I am often over-whelmed by juggling my life's obligations. Home school might not be too much worse than it is now, but it likely won't be better.
* He’s just started making real progress socially—playing a sport at lunch with older kids, tolerating the noisy chaotic yards at recess, and developing friendships with children who seek him out and request his company. Previously, he spent basically all his time away from peers with adults, which suited him practically as he tends to prefer adult company, but I know he longed for social intimacy with peers.

**Reasons to Homeschool:**

* He’s intensely curious and asks deep, thoughtful questions out of the blue. Like, ""How does mirror magnification work on the 2x side of a small mirror?"" ""How can we see Jupiter if it's made of gas and we can't see gas?"" ""Can you see atoms in a microscope?"" ""How does anesthesia actually work?"" I want him to have an education that fosters and protects this curiosity. I’m concerned that school may be dimming that spark. He asks less now than he used to and he is often frustrated and shut down in the afternoons.
* He loves adventures, novelty and learning. We pour over National Geographic coffee table books. He loves listening to audiobooks and loves asking questions. He is a great candidate for unschooling. 
* We’ve secured a spot in a homeschool charter that offers around $5,000 in funds for student enrichment. I have come up with a good tentative schedule: 2 days at a farm school, 1 day of hands-on science at our local zoo, and time with me, a nanny, and drop-in enrichment classes.
* I’m concerned the new IEP support might not be sufficient. I suspect he may have “pathological demand avoidance,” which makes rigid routines hard for him to tolerate. His speech language pathologist at school is pushing him hard on neurotypical social skills in a way that might backfire. This year worked well largely because the school staff really ""got"" him and gave him so much love—but next year is a question mark. If 1st grade doesn’t go well, we can’t join the charter mid-year and access the funds. I am also concerned that a mid-year withdrawal from school might be emotionally disruptive.
* I worry that staying in school may stifle his curiosity and capacity for learning and that we will be able to better foster his curiosity and meet him at the right level at home. 

Right now, it feels wrong to pull him just as he's making social strides and feeling so much community at school. But I also worry that keeping him in will stifle his deep curiosity and emotional learning, and that if we regress, we will have missed out on the best homeschooling path.

1kn0l3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biscuitswithtea/comments/1kn0l3y/thatti_kaapi_and_that_one_goodbye/,Thatti Kaapi and That One Goodbye,"In my thatha’s village near Thanjavur, mornings start with the smell of filter kaapi and the sound of Radio Mirchi playing old Ilayaraja songs. The kind of place where time moves a little slower, where people know your father's name, your grandfather's land, and what time you usually get home.

That’s where I met **Kavi**.

He wasn’t family, not even a friend in the beginning. Just the boy who worked at the corner tea kadai, wiping glasses and delivering kaapi in steel tumblers before school started. But every morning, without fail, he’d keep one extra kaapi aside — the one with more decoction and less sugar. For me.

I never asked. He never explained.

It started with kaapi, but turned into something more. We’d talk about random things — how he wanted to be a photographer, how his amma didn’t understand it, how he once skipped school just to watch the sunrise from the paddy fields. Simple things, yet they felt… real. Like small pockets of truth in a noisy world.

But life has a cruel way of not telling you when something is your **last**.

One Pongal morning, I went to the tea kadai like always. No Kavi. Just an old man at the counter who said, “Avan city-ku poitaan. Appo-ve sollalam nu irundhaan.”

That’s it. No goodbye. No explanation.

The kaapi didn’t taste the same after that.

Years passed. I moved to Chennai. Learned to drink Starbucks. Learned to fake smiles in meetings. Learned to say ""I'm fine"" in three languages.

But some days, when it rains, I boil water and add too much decoction and pour it into a steel tumbler — just the way he used to.

And I sip.

And I remember that there once was a boy named Kavi who never said goodbye but taught me that even strangers can leave lifelong imprints — with just a cup of coffee and quiet presence.

# If you're still holding on to someone who left without closure —

You’re not alone.  
Some stories don’t end.  
They just… stay.

Like the smell of kaapi on a rainy Tamil morning.

Chapter 1  
  
Rebecca Gadot was reborn on the day her parents showed up with files on the three top heirs in New York's elite.  
  
""Pick one to marry.""  
  
Rebecca shook her head without hesitation. ""None of them.""  
  
""What?"" Her parents looked shocked. ""Why not?""  
  
""Because...""  
  
Her heart ached. She'd already married each of them in her previous life.  
  
Everyone knew that the Hemsworth, Madison, Fraser, and Gadot families ruled the New York. As the only daughter among these power players, Rebecca was the prize every family wanted from arranged marriage.  
  
She'd chosen Loki Hemsworth in her last life, thinking she'd hit the jackpot.  
  
But after their wedding, Loki spent 364 days of the year anywhere but home. He made her the joke of Manhattan's elite before dying in a car crash while protecting Ariana Cruise.  
  
After three depressing years as a widow, her family pushed her to marry Darth Madison.  
  
He cared less about her either. Within two years, he killed himself street racing—all for precious Ariana.  
  
Tagged as the ""black widow,"" Rebecca didn't marry again until thirty when she settled for Anton Fraser.  
  
They were civil this time. But on his deathbed, Anton uttered a final wish.  
  
""Rebecca... Next time around, don't pick me for arranged marriage. I only want Ariana.""  
  
That's when it hit her—they were all obsessed with Ariana.  
  
Every single one had the same deathbed confession: don't marry me.  
  
And Ariana? Just the butler's daughter. She's plain and talentless. Totally basic with her fake damsel-in-distress act.  
  
Rebecca couldn't figure out why these powerful men fell for that act, willing to endure loveless arranged marriages just to keep Ariana safe from family politics.  
  
After watching them devoted love for Ariana her entire life, Rebecca learned her lesson: she refused to be anybody's consolation prize.  
  
This time, she had a different answer ready.  
  
""If I have to marry someone, it's Chris Evans or nobody.""  
  
Her parents gaped at her. ""Chris Evans? That bastard son from Los Angeles? Have you lost your mind?""  
  
What they didn't know: in her previous life, Chris Evans rose to the top of the Forbes list, reigning over the business world with absolute power.  
  
If this marriage was just a business transaction, Rebecca would maximize her ROI.  
  
Chris Evans was the best choice.  
  
And love? She'd given up on that fantasy long ago.  
  
Despite her parents' objections, Rebecca kept pushing her case with every argument.  
  
""Los Angeles is booming right now. Evans Enterprises is at the top of their game [there.You](http://there.You) have always wanted to break into that market, right? This is the perfect chance. Plus, you've said yourself that Chris is ambitious and ruthless—that he's destined for greatness.""  
  
Her analysis won them over.  
  
After weighing the pros and cons, her parents decided to respect her wishes. They reached out to the Evans family and sealed the deal.  
  
""Rebecca, we've worked everything out. The wedding's happening in two weeks.""  
  
Rebecca let out a slow breath, her heart finally settling.  
  
With the tight schedule, her parents rushed off to prepare.  
  
Alone on the couch, her thoughts swirled in a storm of emotions.  
  
Moments later, footsteps approached. The door swung open as Loki, Darth, and Anton filed in, their eyes locked on her.  
  
""Rebecca,"" they said in unison. ""Who did you pick?""  
  
Rebecca's eyes flicked over their anxious faces. Memorize flood back.  
  
The four of them had grown up together—practically inseparable. These three guys had always treated her like a princess, spoiling her rotten.  
  
Whatever she wanted, they bought for her. When she was sad, they'd take turns cheering her up. If anyone ever messed with her, they'd be there to defend her.  
  
But now she understood—all that special treatment was just brotherly love.  
  
In her previous life, she thought they rushed to ask because they hoped to be chosen.  
  
Now she knew better. They were terrified of being picked. That's why they looked so nervous.  
  
The realization stung. Her chest tightened.  
  
After a long silence, she collected herself and answered hoarsely, ""You'll find out in fifteen days.""  
  
Her vague answer didn't sit well with them. They grew restless, ready to press her further.  
  
Before they could, her phone rang.  
  
""Miss Gadot, Ariana's been in a terrible accident! She's in the ER right now, but the hospital's out of rooms. Please, you have to help her!""  
  
Hearing butler Brad Cruise's tearful voice, Loki snatched the phone, his voice thick with worry.  
  
""Which hospital?""  
  
The line went quiet for a few seconds, then Brad choked out the name of the hospital.  
  
Loki hung up and headed for the door without hesitation.  
  
""Rebecca, don't worry about the hospital situation. I'll handle it—it's nothing.""  
  
Darth and Anton immediately followed his lead, neither showing a moment's doubt.  
  
""That hospital's owned by my family,"" Darth said. ""I'll talk to the director myself. Just relax, okay?""  
  
""I know some top specialists,"" Anton added. ""I'll make some calls. Don't stress about it, Rebecca.""  
  
They all pretended they were doing this for Rebecca's sake. In reality, they just needed an excuse to see Ariana.  
  
How had she missed something so obvious in her previous life?  
  
Watching them rush out, Rebecca let out a bitter laugh.  
  
She retreated to her bedroom and gathered everything that reminded her of them.  
  
By the time she was done, night had fallen. She grabbed her phone and opened Instagram.  
  
Ariana's latest post popped up.  
  
""Just another day of being spoiled by my three princes.""?""  
  
The selfie showed Ariana in a VIP hospital room, drinking Anton's signature health soup, with Loki's watch on the table and Darth's jacket draped over a chair.  
  
Rebecca hit ""like"" on the post, then stared at the three boxes she'd just packed.  
  
Inside were gifts she'd received on her 18th birthday—family heirlooms from the Hemsworth, Madison, and Fraser families. Whichever gift she kept would signal which family she'd chosen for arranged marriage.  
  
With her wedding already decided, it was time to give her final answer.  
  
She called for a courier and handed over all three boxes.  
  
""Please deliver these to the addresses listed, exactly fifteen days from now.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After sending the packages, Rebecca tossed everything into the trash.  
  
All the jewelry, designer bags, and gifts from Loki, Darth, and Anton. Every video they'd made together. All their photos. Even the suits she'd personally designed for them.  
  
Every memory connected to them was now officially buried in the past.  
  
This time around, Rebecca wouldn't make the same mistakes.  
  
She focused completely on her wedding preparations, ignoring everything else.  
  
After days of fitting dresses and picking out jewelry, she returned home to find Loki, Darth, and Anton hovering around Ariana.  
  
One adjusted the thermostat, another blew on her medicine to cool it down, and the third wrapped a blanket around her shoulders.  
  
Watching Ariana being treated like royalty, Rebecca couldn't help but laugh at herself. Their feelings had been so obvious—how had she missed it in her previous life?  
  
A mix of emotions swirled in her chest—bitterness and regret.  
  
Ariana noticed her first, jolting like a scared rabbit, her face shifting to fearful respect.  
  
""Miss Gadot, you're back! I'll run your bath and prepare dinner right away. Just one moment.""  
  
She tried to stand, but Loki pushed her back down.  
  
""Ariana's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Rebecca, someone else can handle these little tasks.""  
  
Darth and Anton quickly backed him up.  
  
""Yeah, Ariana's injuries are serious. Let her rest, okay?""  
  
""If you're short-staffed, we can bring in more help. No need to make Ariana work.""  
  
Rebecca hadn't said a word since walking in, yet they were already piling on the accusations.  
  
She took a slow breath, narrowing her eyes. ""I know Ariana is the butler's daughter, not a maid. I've never forced her to do anything. If you're so concerned about her, why not take her to your place? Then you can watch over her 24/7 instead of worrying from afar.""  
  
Ariana's eyes widened and she dropped to her knees.  
  
""Miss Gadot, I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please, don't kick me and my dad out! I'll go do the housework right now, I promise!""  
  
Her forehead turned red from hitting the floor as tears streamed down her face, looking utterly devastated.  
  
Seeing her tears, the men's expressions darkened.  
  
They quickly pulled her up and shielded her behind them, glaring at Rebecca with barely contained rage.  
  
""She did nothing wrong. You're kicking her out for no reason? Why are you bullying her like this?""  
  
""She's injured and still worried about cooking for you. Instead of caring about her health, you're trying to force her out. What the hell, Rebecca?""  
  
""Now she's even more hurt because of you. She'll just suffer in silence from now on. You're gonna be happy when she finally collapses, huh?""  
  
Rebecca's expression turned cold as she watched them automatically take Ariana's side.  
  
""Oh, so now I'm the bully? Just because I suggested you take her with you? You really think I'm that cruel, that unreasonable? Everything that goes wrong is my fault, right?""  
  
Her questions hung in the air, silencing the entire living room.  
  
Seeing them struck speechless, a wave of exhaustion hit Rebecca. She had nothing left to say and retreated to her bedroom alone.  
  
Just as she'd calmed down, Ariana knocked on her door with a cup of coffee, looking all doe-eyed and fragile.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Miss Gadot. Please don't be mad at them. They were just worried about me. It's my fault you all fought. Blame me instead.""  
  
Having lived through this before, Rebecca recognized Ariana's pitiful little victim routine while deliberately stirring up trouble. She wasn't falling for it.  
  
""Put the coffee down and get out of my room.""  
  
Ariana's expression grew even more pitiful, though she didn't dare speak.  
  
She deliberately pretended to stumble, spilling the scalding coffee all over Rebecca.  
  
The hot liquid burned Rebecca's skin bright red and blistered.  
  
Rebecca gasped in pain and pushed away Ariana, who was ""trying to help"" with napkins.  
  
Ariana seized the opportunity to fall backward, smashing her head against the corner of the table. Blood immediately poured from the gash on her forehead.  
  
Her piercing scream echoed throughout the mansion.  
  
Before Rebecca could process what happened, Loki, Darth, and Anton kicked open the door and rushed in.  
  
They took one look at Ariana unconscious and bleeding on the floor and panicked.  
  
Darth shoved Rebecca aside. Loki was the first to scoop Ariana up, while Anton pressed his hand over her bleeding wound.  
  
They raced out with Ariana in their arms, completely ignoring Rebecca who was slumped against the shattered glass cabinet, bleeding from a dozen cuts.  
  
Blood soaked through her clothes as her face contorted in pain, her body trembling uncontrollably.  
  
Rebecca watched them run off with Ariana and finally broke. Tears streamed down her face.  
  
The pain in her heart was unbearable, but she bit her lip to keep from making a sound. Only one thought remained:  
  
She needed to escape their world and never cross paths with any of them ever again.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
After getting her wounds treated, Rebecca went to pick up her prescription. In the neighboring room, she spotted familiar figures.  
  
Loki, Darth, and Anton hovered outside Ariana's hospital room, their faces etched with unconcealed concern.  
  
""I told you. Ariana's too soft. Staying with the Gadots only means endless mistreatment. Once the arranged marriage is settled, we have to get her out of there. I can't watch her suffer anymore.""  
  
""Our parents all know Ariana's the one we really care about. We need to guarantee her safety. So whoever Rebecca chooses has to accept the marriage without complaint. That's the only way to keep our families from targeting Ariana.""  
  
Rebecca watched silently, her heart shattering.  
  
So that's why they'd agreed to marry her in her previous life despite not loving her.  
  
They thought they were being heroes, sacrificing themselves for love.  
  
But all they did was ruin her life.  
  
She lowered her head, laughing until tears streamed down her face.  
  
They didn't have to worry this time. None of them had to sacrifice anything.  
  
As she wiped her tears and turned to leave, her phone alarm went off.  
  
The sudden noise startled the three men. They pushed open the door and seemed surprised to see her.  
  
""What are you doing here? Coming to apologize to Ariana?""  
  
""How long have you been standing there? Did you overhear something?""  
  
Why are you covered in cuts and bruises? What happened?""  
  
Faced with their rapid-fire questions, Rebecca answered each one.  
  
""These injuries? I got them when you shoved me into a glass cabinet while rushing to Ariana's rescue.""  
  
""I'm here to get treated, not to apologize. She deliberately spilled hot coffee on me first. I pushed her away. And that's it. Running into you guys? Pure coincidence.""  
  
Her version of events made the three men froze, their expressions growing complicated.  
  
Recalling what happened when they burst into the room, Darth broke the silence first.  
  
""Ariana didn't spill that coffee on purpose. Her hands were weak from her injuries. Don't hold it against her. And when we saw all that blood, we thought she was in serious danger. That's why we lost it. Sorry.""  
  
Loki collected himself. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier today. We just felt bad for her and spoke up.""  
  
""Look, we grew up together. You've always been the most important person to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""  
  
All three of them were staring at her anxiously, waiting for her answer.  
  
Seeing their reactions after what she'd just overheard, Rebecca could only laugh at the irony.  
  
""Yes, I've decided. You three—""  
  
Before she could finish, the monitors in Ariana's room started beeping.  
  
The men's hearts dropped. They spun around and rushed back into the room as medical staff hurried past.  
  
""The patient suffered secondary kidney damage that we didn't detect! We administered the wrong medication, which triggered kidney failure. The situation is critical!""  
  
Loki's face went pale, his eyes turning red.  
  
""Are you kidding me? What the hell were you doing giving her the wrong meds? She's so young! If anything happens to her, you'll pay for it!""  
  
Darth grabbed the doctor's collar, his voice shaking with rage.  
  
""You have thirty minutes to come up with a treatment plan to fix this. If Ariana doesn't make it, I swear, you're all done.""  
  
Anton was already on the phone, pacing frantically.  
  
""Dr. Gibson? You're the top nephrologist in New York. I need your help saving someone extremely important to me. It's urgent. I'll send a car to pick you up. Where are you?""  
  
The room had descended into chaos, everyone panicking about Ariana's condition.  
  
The hospital quickly assembled a specialized team and rushed to develop a treatment plan.  
  
""The only solution is a kidney transplant, but finding a compatible donor will take time. The longer we wait, the more dangerous her situation becomes!""

I was already emotional before it happened, and when he came to the window, I wad crying and said something like, “I am so sorry, I’ve just got a lot going on with family stuff.” 

 He asked for my license and registration, then asked for my cell number. He wrote it down on the registration, took everything back to his car, and came back a few minutes later.

When he returned, he gave me my stuff and said, “Please step out of the vehicle.” Thats never happened and I was worried but he told me to hug him. Truth is I am going through a traumatic divorce with 2 kids, and this is the nicest anyone has been in a long time. 

He  offered to buy me coffee a few times, then a doughnut. I said no because I felt guilty and was headed to work. I also mentioned I was going through a divorce at some point, and he still offered to buy me coffee. He told me to stop saying I was sorry and hugged me again. I was not myself at all, haven’t been for a while. Divorce does that. 

Not trying to overthink it, just wondering if this kind of thing happens often when someone’s visibly upset, or if it seems out of the norm.

Also - is it weird if I drop off a thank-you card at the station? I appreciated how he treated me, but I don’t  know if that’s appropriate.

**AITAH for telling my fiancé that if he expects me to contribute 50/50, we have to make some serious lifestyle changes?**

My (26F) fiancé (26M) sat me down yesterday and gave me a long talk about how he feels like I don't contribute enough to the household, particularly in the financial sense. I was a bit caught off guard by this, but was willing to hear him out, since he wasn't wrong. He makes a lot more than I do, and we've always split bills accordingly, which ends up being about 80% him. I asked what he wanted me to pay now, and he was adamant about it being 50/50.

I asked if everything was okay with his job, or if he needed to take fewer hours, and he wouldn't answer me. I honestly wouldn't have gotten upset if there seemed like an actual reason behind it, but he just said he'd been thinking about it a lot, over and over, every time I asked what brought him to this conclusion, what was going on, and eventually he just said ""this is how it's going to be, take it or leave it."" Those exact words, in response to literally everything I said. Full shutdown. No explanations.

I told him that was fine I'll take it, and then asked if he'd made a zillow account yet, or expected me to. He looked confused, and asked why we would need a zillow account. I explained that there's no way I can afford half rent on our current place, so we'll probably have to move into a one-bedroom apartment. He got mad and asked why I didn't have savings. I told him that I do, but I'm not paying rent out of my savings, because that's a terrible and unsustainable idea. I also began to go over what our new food budget would be, our new entertainment budget, and that we'd probably have to sell the cars and get one less expensive one because I can't afford half of the payments on an Audi and a Land Rover. Then I explained that date nights would probably have to be reduced too, and we could still do, like Buffalo Wild Wings or something, but I preferred Thursday nights because you get two orders of boneless wings for one. Basically, if he wants me to pay half, we're living within *my* means, not his anymore.

He kind of agreed to it, but since then, he's been incredibly angry. He's not saying or doing anything, but it's like he's walking around the house in this cloud of pissed-off. I sent him six zillow listings, all of which he's called uninhabitable for various reasons, some of which I think were valid, others I disagree with. He's now saying that I'm being unfair and manipulative, and that he tried to come to me with a serious concern about our relationship and I'm making it impossible for him to talk to me, and bulldozing over him.

AITA?

**Verdict:** *NTA*

**Relevant Comments:**

*NTA at all and you are making perfect sense in my mind. If he wants 50/50 he needs to understand that your income is the limiting agent in this reaction.*

*It does sound like he has something else going on and I would mentally prepare for him to call the wedding off. This sounds like he is coming up with reasons to get rid of you in his mind but he does not want to come off as the bad guy.* \- **CenturionHolder**

Hi everyone! This got way bigger than intended, so I figured a follow-up was owed.

So, last time I posted was Monday. Monday as a whole was spent just sorting through what I felt, and what to do next. There was a lot of silence and a lot of anger, and a LOT of reddit advice, some of which I found very insightful, some of which was less so. Also some people think I made this up as part of a viral marketing sponsorship between buffalo wild wings, audi, and zillow, which honestly would solve the money problems if true, but alas, is not the case.

On Tuesday, after I got home from work, I sort of just walked up to him on the elliptical and explained as calmly as I could that I had questions, and if he actually wanted to marry me, he needed to be willing to answer them. I asked if he thought I was a gold digger, yes or no. He said yes. I told him that I wasn't willing to be in a relationship where I have to prove myself by sacrificing any sort of stability, and that led to a bit of a screaming match, and eventually, a confession.

So it turns out we cannot afford anything we have right now. We are in serious credit card debt, the cars are both on the verge of being repossessed, and I did not know about any of this. He's been cutting corners on actual necessities, including psychiatric medication. That in combination with some comments from his family led him to some pretty dark places. My fiancé had a full breakdown and apologized for calling me a gold digger, which was nice to hear, but this whole thing had me pretty shaken up. I went to stay with a friend for a little bit.

Yesterday, my fiancé and I did in fact go out to BWW and get the two for one boneless. We talked, a lot. I'm still writing fiancé for now, and I really hope we can work through all of this. We talked about how to sell the cars-- we don't particularly have a choice at this point-- and about my income, his income, and the sort of life we want to have. If we do stay together, we'll be changing how we live a lot. We need to get out of debt, we need to get on our feet. I know some people are gonna say I'm being dumb for not immediately dropping all contact and giving up on the relationship, but I can't do that. I can't look at the guy I love, who went off his meds to try and make a good life for me, and think he's not worth sticking around for, at least to try.

I don't know what the future looks like at all anymore though, and the wedding is very postponed at the moment. Sorry this wasn't a more fun update.

**Relevant Comments:**

*Watch your credit like a hawk home slice* \- **Massive\_Length\_400**

*While I understand that you want to make it work, there are a few things of note;*

*It's absolutely critical to know exactly how the debt got that deep. It's not at all acceptable that he's been cutting corners on psychiatric medication. He was going to point the finger at you being in the wrong until you brought up leaving.*

*His choices have left you both in debt. How much of an effort is he willing to make to help you both claw out?*

*You really need to take a hard look at this relatjonship, and how your future will look in it.* \- **YomiKuzuki**

1. Pretty as fuck. This is the most physically attractive man I have ever met. Literal golden curls like a da Vinci painting, crystal blue eyes, just so pretty it gives me butterflies whenever he looks at me sometimes.
2. Best I've ever had in bed. Very good at just about anything, actually likes going down on me, and makes me see stars. I have never been in a relationship that was as sexually satisfying as this one, and there's no way I'm going back after this.
3. His voice is very sexy. Especially when he speaks Russian. He also speaks French, Spanish, and apparently Latin? But Russian is my favorite.
4. Got a vasectomy so I could go off birth control. He was the one to suggest it, because he saw how much I hated those stupid pills, and he was willing to get an actual surgery for me.
5. Full of little surprises and adventures. He's always doing things like getting me wildflowers, making my favorite breakfast before I wake up, or even planning little day adventures for us to go on together. Life is never mundane because he's always making it special.
6. Actually does housework. Does not need to be asked to do housework. He actually does more of the cleaning than I do, and I cook most of the meals, because he thinks that sweeping and mopping floors is ""meditative."" I do not know how I got this lucky on this one.
7. Plays guitar. Really, really well. It's very attractive.
8. Can physically pick me up and carry me around and does this often. I am not a small woman, to be clear. This is legitimately impressive and makes me feel so nice.
9. READS. I can actually talk about books!! With him!! You have no idea how rare this is, especially to find a guy who'll read anything I say ""oh I liked this."" You do not comprehend the feeling of mentioning offhandedly that you're reading Midnight Sun and having him come to you *the next day* after spending all night reading so that you could talk about it together until you live it.
10. Has shown me that there is actual romance in life and that I deserve more than a flat boring relationship devoid of orgasms or dancing in the rain or music. He brought real passion and fun and aliveness into my life, and in a world where that's treated as an unrealistic fantasy for most women, he's shown me that I deserve something unrealistic.

**Relevant Comments:**

*He may be the first man to give you romance, passion, and fun, but he’s not the only one who can. These things are great right now, but long term stability depends on much more important factors. Financial problems are a leading cause of divorce because once the fun stage is over, you’re simply faced with the crushing reality.*

*If you do stay with him despite all advice, please keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit score, and him in general. Don’t marry him until/unless something changes in a major way cause if you take on his debts you’ll be stuck.* \- **altiboris**

*It's a little concerning that your top three are physical attributes (plus no.8) and not personality traits. Looks fade, people get injured, they age and physically change. If the biggest things you like about him are how he looks, how he does in bed, and that he can pick you up you're not setting yourself up for success. One car accident, one work injury, hell even just five or ten years and half your list could be out.*

*I'm also really curious about the vasectomy thing.... You say he did it for you but are you sure he didn't do it for him so he won't end up with a baby on the side? All the men I know who have had vasectomies had them after they were married and had at least one child. Idk this just rings alarm bells for me.* \- **IamtheRealDill**

**Update - 2 years later**



We are out of debt.

It feels so, so good to say that and have it be true, but as of three days ago, everything is finally paid off and we've made our way back onto solid ground.

Almost two years ago, I made a post here about my(28F) fiance(28M) wanting to split things 50-50, and my offer of compromising on lifestyle changes. As it turned out, he was off his meds and had managed to get himself into some serious debt, a little under 100k, trying to provide a life that we could not afford on a combined 155k a year. Things were rough. I almost left him a few times. But we have finally, finally, finally made it through to the other side.

I handle the finances. 100% of the finances. I give him a budget for buying coffee. It wasn't fun, but in exchange he started doing more of the housework, so it evens out. We moved from our over-the-top apartment into a shared living situation, which, while not ideal, was leagues better than my initial plan of getting a trailer. We have roommates, but they're on another floor, so it's not too bad, and we have our own bathroom which was my only real stipulation. We've lived like we're a 70k a year couple, doing actual 50-50 finances, and every extra penny he's made has gone directly to paying off the debt.

We sold the cars, obviously. Traded them in for a nice used Ford Maverick and a Vespa. That helped a lot. There have been no more lavish vacations or over-the-top restaurants with $500 price tags. It was rough for my fiance at first. He's always been very much a rich boy, and I think losing that as an identity was difficult for him. That being said-- he's gotten *so creative* lately, it's been amazing to see. He will make me things if he can't buy me things, and we've started cooking together instead of having me do almost all of it. Our room is covered in the things he's made for me, and it's really lovely.

We're still in love. We're still going strong. And we can finally, finally, finally start actually planning our wedding again. We're gonna get our own place first, but the wedding is next on the list after that. I'm so glad that we stuck with this, and being on the other side is the greatest feeling in the world.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice. <3 I don't know how things would have ended up if I hadn't had the courage of my convictions, and I'm genuinely grateful to those who directed me to Dave Ramsey and Caleb Hammer. Y'all are awesome!!

TL;DR: WE MADE IT OUT AND ARE OFFICIALLY DEBT FREE!

**Blue-Being22**

*Hold on here! Let me get this straight. So…you communicated about all the hard stuff, right? And communicated some more.*

*Then you made a plan. And made long term sacrifices to enact said plan. Then you continued to communicate and did all the hard work over a couple of years to meet your goals?*

*What?!? I’m so confused. Is this even Reddit?*

*P.S. (Kudos to you and your partner! I’m impressed.)*

>OOP: We did as a matter of fact do all of the above! It wasn't easy, but it was worth it in the end.



**Turuial**

*This is kind of why reddit leaps to ""just leave them"" much of the time. People don't want to listen and do the work the way you two did. I'm so proud of you both.*

*It reminds me of when my doctor was telling me he had to start me on something for cholesterol. I listened, went home, and made lifestyle changes.*

*I changed what I ate, changed up my exercise routine, walked more, and within a month he was able to take me off Lipitor. He was shocked.*

*I told him about the changes and he started laughing. That's when he told me that is usually the best step, but people so frequently won't do it that he just went straight to the medication option.*

*Congratulations on being debt free, soon-to-be living by yourselves, and for your inevitable wedding! I'd say you two don't just deserve it, but that you've earned it.*

*One last thing to mention, in your other writings you've mentioned the kind of dark way that his family was able to get into his head.*

*Any progress on that front, ideally? Especially now that you're back on track towards them becoming your in-laws in the somewhat near future.*

>*OOP: Oh, we don't get along but we*'re civil because we all love my fiance and we all want him to be happy. We will never do Sunday dinners as a family or anything, but they accept I'm good for him and have thanked me privately a few times for helping him out of debt.



**Pollythepony1993**

*That is so great to hear! Congratulations on the hard work. You should be proud of yourself. And there must be real love between you if you worked through it together. I am so happy for you!*

>OOP: There's a lot of love here. He's my person, you know? I genuinely feel like the luckiest girl in the world when I'm around him, and God knows he loves me to the moon and back.

**Just\_Following\_6465**

*This is a massive GREEN flag on how you all worked through this. Just validation that you all can make it through a marriage long term. A lot of people can’t. You’ll go through other trials like this in your marriage and you both handled it so well. Congrats to the future wedding!*

>OOP: Thank you! It was not the easiest thing in the world, but hey, nothing worth doing is gonna be easy all the time, right?

The hospital hummed its low, eternal lullaby—machines beeping, air vents sighing, distant footsteps echoing like fading heartbeats. Dr. Elena Voss sat in the dim glow of her office, coat unbuttoned, stethoscope limp around her neck, a paper cup of lukewarm coffee cradled between trembling hands.



The clock read 3:03 a.m.—the hour when hope sleeps and silence grows teeth.



“You look tired, Elena.”



She didn’t flinch. She never did anymore.



“You’re late,” she replied, without looking up.



Death stepped from the shadowed corner like smoke taking form. He wore no cloak, bore no scythe—just a charcoal-gray suit, crisp and still as a pressed memory. His eyes were black, but not empty; they shimmered faintly, like light behind a closed door.



“I had business upstairs,” he said, nodding toward the pediatric wing. “You kept me waiting.”



“I always do.”



A faint smile touched the corners of his mouth. “True. You’ve become very good at it.”



She looked at him now, her face hollowed by sleeplessness and time. “You remember the Miller boy? The one with the failing heart?”



“I remember all of them. He had three days, maybe four.”



“He lived another two years.”



Death nodded, not displeased. “You fought well that time.”



“I always fight.”



Death tilted his head. “But not always to win.”



The silence returned, thick as gauze. Elena sipped her coffee. “Do you ever wonder what it would be like to lose completely?”



“I have. Every time I watch you work.”



She laughed—just once. A sharp, tired sound. “You’re poetic tonight.”



“I get sentimental. With old adversaries.”



They sat in the hush of unspoken names—patients who had passed, those who had lived, the ones who still clung to the cliff’s edge with nothing but her hands between them and the fall.



“Remember the bus crash?” she said. “Sixteen surgeries in a single night.”



“You saved ten,” he replied. “I took six. It was… close.”



“I broke my hand that night,” she said, flexing the stiff fingers. “Didn’t stop.”



“I know.”



They looked at each other like veterans sharing a scar. There was no malice in his gaze—only understanding, and something eerily close to reverence.



“I’m tired, you know,” she whispered.



“I know.”



“I don’t want to stop. But I’m not sure how much I have left.”



Death stood, smooth as breath leaving lungs. “Then rest. Just for tonight. I’ll wait.”



“You always do,” she said, voice fading as she leaned back in her chair.



Death placed a gentle hand on her shoulder—not to take, only to comfort.



When the nurse found her an hour later, the doctor was still asleep in her chair, peaceful for once, as though she’d made peace with something larger than exhaustion.



And Death, true to his word, was gone.

For now



**Scene: “The Final Whistle”**



Rain tapped on the stadium roof like impatient fingers. The locker room was quiet now, save for the dripping of showers and the low hum of distant applause. The game was over. The crowd had chanted his name one last time.



Luca Reyes sat on the wooden bench, his leg wrapped in ice, the old ache in his knee now a roar. His jersey clung to him, damp with sweat and rain and the weight of years he was never supposed to have.



He didn’t look up when the door opened.



“I wondered when you’d show.”



A figure stepped in from the shadows. Impeccably dressed—charcoal three-piece suit, shoes that gleamed like oil slicks. His smile was too sharp, too wide, and his eyes burned with something that had never known mercy.



“Five years,” the demon said, admiring the championship medal around Luca’s neck. “You squeezed every drop from it.”



“I gave you everything you asked for.”



“You did,” the demon agreed, circling the room like a lion in no hurry. “That knee should’ve ended your career. You know it. Every doctor told you the same thing. Yet here you are—five titles, two golden boots, and the adoration of millions.”



“I didn’t do it for the fame.”



“No,” the demon said. “You did it because you couldn’t stand the silence. You needed to matter. Even if it cost you… this.”



He tapped the bench beside Luca. The wood cracked slightly under his touch.



Luca took a slow breath. “So that’s it, then? You take my soul, drag me to some pit?”



The demon gave a mock gasp. “Soul? Oh, Luca, you really should’ve read the fine print. I don’t need your soul.”



Luca’s brow furrowed. “Then what—”



“I need *you*,” the demon said softly, tapping his temple. “Your mind. Your will. All that drive, all that fire that refused to die. You’ll keep playing, in a sense. But not for trophies. For me.”



A chill ran through Luca’s spine, colder than any stadium night.



“You’ll run until your legs fall off,” the demon whispered. “You’ll fight in my games—arenas you can’t imagine. No crowds, no cheers. Just survival. Forever.”



Luca clenched his fists. “You tricked me.”



The demon shrugged. “I offered five years. You asked for glory. We both got what we wanted.”



There was silence between them, broken only by thunder rolling above.



“Can I say goodbye?” Luca asked.



The demon paused, as if amused. “To whom?”



Luca stared at his locker—photos of his mother, the boots from his first match, a worn-out armband from the academy. “To who I was.”



The demon’s grin faded slightly.



“Make it quick,” he said.



Luca stood slowly, every bone screaming, and placed the armband back in the locker. He whispered something to it—too quiet for any mortal to hear.



Then he turned.



“I’m ready.”



The lights flickered—and they were gone.

Just a bench left behind,

and an empty jersey,

still warm.



**Short Story: “The Old Watcher”**



The family came home under a gray spring sky, shoes muddy from the shelter parking lot, arms full of blankets and nervous excitement. In the youngest boy’s hands squirmed a bundle of black and white fur with too-big ears and a tongue that wouldn’t stay in its mouth.



The puppy’s name was Milo, and he smelled like anxiety and baby shampoo.



At the edge of the porch, under the rusted wind chimes, lay an old shepherd with a coat like soot and snow. His name was Rex. He didn’t rise, but his ears twitched at the sound of new paws padding on the porch.



The family knelt beside Rex, stroking his grizzled fur. The mother whispered, “We thought a friend might cheer you up, old boy.”



Milo sat, his tail a blur. “Are you the one they call Rex? The first dog? The porch guardian? The jingle of collars?”



Rex let out a long breath, the kind that’s been waiting years to be released.



“They call me that. Some of those things.”



“I’m Milo!” the puppy declared. “I’m supposed to be brave and learn to bark at clouds and chase sticks and protect the house from things that aren’t real!”



Rex opened one eye. “You’ll do all that. Eventually.”



Milo tilted his head. “What are they like? The family? I mean—they *seem* nice. But you’ve been here a long time, right? Are they… good?”



Rex looked toward the window. The boy inside was drawing in crayon, glancing out every few seconds to make sure the puppy was still there. The father was in the kitchen, humming off-key, while the mother put a blanket in a basket by the fireplace—the puppy’s first bed.



“They are,” Rex said, voice like old boots on wood floors. “They are the sun in the morning and the lamp at night. They forget to close doors, drop scraps on the floor, and cry sometimes when they think no one’s watching.”



He paused, eyes drifting to a spot in the yard where a tiny tree grew from where another dog once rested.



“They are soft, and strange, and good. They will love you louder than the world does. And you… you’ll follow them from room to room, always a few steps behind, until they forget what life felt like before you.”



Milo’s ears perked. “That sounds important.”



“It is.”



The wind shifted. Rain was coming. Milo shivered.



Rex stood with effort, joints stiff, body slow, but regal still. He nudged Milo toward the basket inside. “Go on now. First night’s always the hardest. I’ll be on the porch.”



“You’re not coming in?”



Rex looked out over the yard, where shadows stretched long and quiet. “Not yet. The world still needs a watcher.”



Milo hesitated, then padded inside, the warmth of the home wrapping around him like a heartbeat. He curled in the basket, blanket tucked under his chin.



From the porch, Rex watched until the lights dimmed and the boy’s laughter faded into dreams.



He settled back into his spot beneath the chimes, eyes sharp, heart steady.



His family—his eternal guardians—were safe.

And so was the little one,

who would one day know what it meant to *keep watch*. Absolutely. Here’s the next part of Rex and Milo’s story:



⸻



**Part II: “The First Bark”**



The days rolled by like warm marbles, smooth and easy. Spring turned the yard green again, and Milo grew—awkward legs, floppy ears, and the kind of clumsy joy only puppies could possess. He chased moths, barked at garden gnomes, and napped in sunbeams with his tongue poking out.



But every evening, just before sunset, Milo padded out to the porch where Rex lay, stoic as ever beneath the rusted chimes.



“What do we watch for tonight?” Milo would ask.



Rex always gave the same answer: “Everything.”



One night, a storm rolled in. Wind shook the windows and rain drummed against the roof like pawbeats. Milo whimpered from his basket, eyes wide at every crack of thunder.



He crawled out, slipping and skidding on the hardwood, and pushed open the door with his nose. On the porch, Rex sat tall against the wind, ears alert, gaze fixed on the yard.



“You’re not scared?” Milo asked, huddling beside him.



“Of the storm?” Rex huffed. “No. It’s not the thunder we’re watching for.”



Milo leaned into him. “Then what?”



Rex didn’t answer for a long time.



“When the boy was little,” he said finally, “he ran into the road after a ball. A truck came. I ran faster.”



Milo blinked. “You saved him?”



Rex nodded slowly. “He didn’t stop crying for hours. Sat beside me on the porch. His little hand on my fur, saying sorry over and over.”



The storm began to pass. The thunder faded like a growl dying in the distance.



“You’ve been through a lot,” Milo whispered.



“So will you,” Rex replied. “But that’s the work. Loving them is the easy part. *Guarding* them—that’s where your heart learns what it’s really for.”



Milo’s ears drooped with thought.



“I want to be good at it,” he said quietly.



“You will be,” Rex said, lowering his head. “Because you care. That’s where it starts.”



They lay there together until dawn colored the sky. Milo had his first dream on the porch that morning—a dream of wind and tall grass, of barking at shadows and standing beside someone who never looked away.





**Part III: “The Final Watch”**



It was a quiet morning. The kind where the birds sang low and the trees barely stirred, as if even the wind didn’t want to wake the day too quickly.



Rex hadn’t left the porch that week. His steps had grown slow, his breaths shallow. He no longer chased off the raccoons or rose to greet the mail truck with a low, noble bark. The family noticed. The boy sat with him longer each evening. The mother wrapped a blanket around his shoulders. Even the father, always busy, lingered on the porch with gentle pats and old stories.



Milo never left his side.



He was bigger now—legs steadier, voice stronger. The clumsy, bouncing puppy had grown into a young dog, full of energy and watchfulness. He still loved chasing moths, but now he checked every room before bed. He still curled in the sun, but only after he made sure the gate was locked and the house was safe.



That morning, as dew clung to the grass, Rex opened his eyes and looked at Milo.



“You’ve been watching,” Rex said.



“I have,” Milo replied.



Rex tried to rise, but only made it halfway before sinking back down with a sigh. “Then you know.”



Milo’s voice was quiet. “It’s time, isn’t it?”



Rex didn’t answer. He just looked out over the yard, his eyes softer than they had ever been.



“I remember when they brought me home,” he said. “The boy was barely walking. The mother was tired all the time. The father worked late. But there was love. Always love. And I swore, right then, I would never let it fade. Never let it go unguarded.”



“You didn’t,” Milo said. “You’ve done more than any dog could ever do.”



Rex closed his eyes for a moment. “I’m not afraid. Just… sad I won’t see what kind of dog you become.”



Milo laid his head next to Rex’s, his voice trembling. “You already know.”



The porch filled with golden light as the sun rose fully. Inside, the boy’s laughter rang out—high and clear and full of life.



Rex opened his eyes one last time.



“Keep watch, Milo,” he whispered. “Keep it well.”



And then, he was still.



The wind moved the chimes, just once, and Milo stood. Taller now. Not a puppy. Not quite a guardian yet. But ready.



He stepped to the edge of the porch and sat, head high, ears sharp.



And so the house remained watched.

By a younger heart,

but one taught by the very best.

1kn02r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/1kn02r8/new_para_i_not_hitting_off/,New Para + I: Not Hitting Off,"Disclaimer - long vent incoming. 

We finally found a person who has the experience we need at my current firm as another litigation paralegal. To preface, I am the lead paralegal and while I used to oversee a paralegal team of 5, the firm downsized and then my favorite co-worker/para moved, so it’s been down between me and a legal assistant. However, the partners trust me and allow me to contribute in the hiring process for the new para (i.e sit in the interview, ask questions, debrief and provide input if I like the candidate or not). I’m saying this now to provide some insight on how large my role is in the firm. 

Fast forward, we end up hiring a male paralegal. I’ve worked with male attorneys before so I didn’t think the gender would matter but maybe it does play a factor?? I don’t know but he’s only worked with our firm for two weeks and we have already hit it off in the wrong foot. He’s been a para way longer than me (he’s also older than me age wise as well), but I do hold a managing position in this firm  — the attorneys trust me to delegate tasks to paras, oversee the team, and the partners even told him during his interview that I am basically in charge. But I think that the new para does not like that based on his demeanor and I’m not sure how to deal with his cold attitude. Or, if he thinks I’m acting bigger than my role but it’s essentially my job to look over the other paras to ensure they complete their tasks. I’ve done it to previous paralegals (all women btw) and none posed a problem and would rather come to me than attorneys when it comes to asking questions re: projects/tasks. I worked with paralegals who had more experience than me but they put their ego at the door and accepted my role and had no issue with me overseeing them. Not to mention that the legal assistant also has more yrs on me - experience and age, but she doesn’t give me an attitude at all. 

Additionally, he doesn’t like it when I correct him on some of our procedures. And he never responds to my Teams messages, which is frustrating because I feel like I have to micromanage to make sure he’s completed a task. All I’m asking is for him
to acknowledge that he saw a task that’s assigned to me and notify me and attorneys when it’s been done. We have it to where the attorneys assign paralegals (or tell me to assign them) on Teams 90% of the time to cut down on email clutter and in person convos (+ some attys and me work hybrid). I usually give a thumbs up to attys to recognize that I see the task and then notify atty upon completion. The new para completely ghosts the attorneys so then I have to follow up to tell him hey did you see this task? Did you finish? And, he gives me a passive agressive response as if I’m supposed to read his mind that he completed the task based on no acknowledgment…

I already have one attorney advise me he did a project incorrectly but because he’s given me a cold attitude, I ended up having to redo rather than follow up with him to correct. He also bills exorbitant amounts of time for a task that should take 20 mins max. (i.e he billed 6 hours for a task I know takes .2). His work is also sup-par quality but I can forgive that since he’s still learning the ropes.

He’s not polite with me. He demanded I give him a check once (no please or thank you) so he can go to court.

Again, he really doesn’t like it when I delegate him a task (even though I and partners were transparent of that in the interview process). 

He’s also not a team player? I used to have paras (in just their first week) come to me to see what new projects they can do, or learn more about cases they can take on, or ask if there’s more they can do to help - but he’s never asked for work and then acts so overwhelmed when an attorney or me do assign him a task, which takes him all day to complete (and he stays late to complete that one task). He’s acting as if he’s worked with the firm for 5 years and not 2 weeks?

I woke him up and he was immediately cranky saying that he didn’t want to leave yet- which normally I can be flexible but I had to work that evening and was hoping to get some rest in when we got to our destination. I asked what time he would be willing to leave still trying to accommodate him and he wouldn’t tell me a time or if he did he would say he was coming in a couple of days. After at least 15 minutes of going around in circles I left to get coffee and give us room to cool off. I came back trying to fix the mood and develop a plan so I was sitting by him and leaning on his torso which he was ok with begrudgingly and then he became more irritated, started calling me names and grabbed me by my hair (hard) which resulted in me leaving. 
When I left he texted me to drive safe which I responded that he went too far and that I won’t be with someone who thinks it’s okay to treat me the way he did. He responded and told me to grow up and get over myself, and said next time don’t act like a bipolar weirdo (because I came back in a calmer state) and I told him there would be no next time because pulling hair is abuse (with a screenshot from google too) and I don’t deserve that. He responded with a screenshot asking google if suffocation was assault, to which I did not respond. I am a 115 lbs and I was laying on his torso. In no way shape or form was I impacting his breathing or suffocating him? I believe this is deflection. He could have moved out from under me easily but instead he pulled my hair. 
We have been together for a year, we have never been physical with one another before- he is definitely mouthy at times but I feel him grabbing my hair like that crossed the line. I can’t tell if I am overreacting? I am a DV survivor, I can recognize the signs, I have voiced my needs and feelings surrounding what I need to feel supported in a relationship- I’ve worked too hard on myself to be in a situation where I allow myself to be mistreated again. 
He hasn’t apologized or reached out to me and I don’t think would make a difference even if he did, it will be hard, I thought that he was my best friend, we talked 24/7 but I have to love myself more than allowing myself to be mistreated by someone who is supposed to love me.

been in SF for about a month and wanted to share my dating impressions with you and ask for some clarifications!

I have never been a fan of the apps. Where I live they are mainly used for hook ups (which I am not interested in) and the ones that aren't - my experience was that it was just endless correspondence and took a lot of effort to get someone to meet up live.

So I was pleasantly pleased with the state of things on the apps in SF:

\- The quality of chat is pretty good, men are funny and engaging and a lot are quite fast to ask one out.

\- Effort is being made to plan dates and make it a nice experience. I have had endless coffees of course, but also really lovely long walks, lunches, dinners, drinks and even went to some gigs/shows.

\- Men are polite, considerate and punctual. When on a date they are present - most don't even get their phones out and if they do check their phones they excuse themselves. They are more or less good conversationalists - they ask questions, listen and answer.

\- Communication is easy and fairly straightforward. People are quick to ask one out again, and suggest further activities.

Here is where I get confused:

\- I had a nice date with someone, but I am definitely not physically attracted to that person and would not entertain having sex with them, so do I go on a second date anyway? Or do I tell them straight up 'can we just be friends'?

\- How long does the dating thing go on for before men expect something? I mean is there some unwritten rule about this that I am not aware of? Because I would be interested in seeing some again, but just really want to leave myself leeway if I don't want to physically engage and would not want anyone getting the wrong message (maybe this is very Millennial of me to say!).

\- ENM/open relationships/fun dates... WTF? What's 'fun dating' if someone is single? They just want to pass a few hours in pleasant company of a woman without having sex with her or exploring something more serious? What's the difference between ENM and an open relationship (and don't tell me to ChatGPT it, I need some lived experiences!)? And don't even get me started on polycules!

\- How long does the dating thing last? Is anyone really exclusive - as in not on the apps if they are in a relationship? I am sure just like me, these men I have seen have their app inboxes full of chats with other women.

Ah, the tyranny of choice!

I love your city and thank you for having me! And women, do not despair, it could be a lot worse. Though I am sure there are some pitfalls I am yet to run into!

P.S. I do realise I have asked twice about the duration of this dating ritual, but it is rather confusing to me, so as many examples as possible would be welcome!",23,1747285171.0,sanfrancisco,16,0.74,False

1kmzywb,https://www.reddit.com/r/statenisland/comments/1kmzywb/the_ferry_terminals_are_a_disgrace/,The Ferry Terminals Are A Disgrace.,"I take the ferry. A lot. Not every day, but multiple times a week, and I think most ferry commuters will agree that the terminals are at best a disgrace and at worst an utter abomination.

First we have St. George, who, in a borough brimming with mom and pop coffee shops and excellent pizza, has only a Subway and the River Dock cafe to show for its efforts. I know they put up silly banners to gain interest for new places, but is anything actually being done to fill them? I know in general, ""retail is dying,"" but there are a few examples on the island of retail actually making a come back. 

What's happening with the SI Arts shed and the welcome center? 

Then we have the now former fishtanks, a monument to poor thinking, still taking up space on the main floor. Either get rid of them or replace them with something that would be easier to maintain. It doesn't need to be grandiose, just something aesthetically pleasing.

Then we have Whitehall. What should be the gateway welcoming you to the city, a should-be crown jewel of city transit. The ferry version of Grand Central. 

Instead, the first thing you're greeted with is a bunch of homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk. Now i'm not necessarily blaming them, i'm blaming the city. In a city that likes to show off, seeing people in ratty clothes sleeping on the ground as the first thing you see upon exiting the boat...kinda gives off the vibe that the city just doesn't care about how it looks. I cannot scrub the mental image of seeing a buck ass nude guy on a sunday morning as I got off the boat a few years ago - out of my head. And I wish badly that I could. Really. We can do better, we have done better. 

Then you have the showtime guys, who have moved from nearly kicking people in the head on the 1 train to nearly kicking people in the head outside the ferry. Then the helicopter/ferry hawkers and the headphone guy. 

The tourist situation is another problem. Between 11am and sometimes as late as even into the early rush hour(3:30pm-ish), the terminal is overrun with tourists and tour guides damn near impaling people with their umbrellas, creating a crowd rush that will eventually kill someone. They rush to get on, and upon docking in St. George, damn near bowl you over trying to get back on the boat, because, as previously noted, there is nothing keeping them here on S.I.

I know its just one guys complaints, and it means nothing to most people, but to me the ferry should be a sense of pride, not something that is an embarrassment. Our elected officials, if they want to remain elected should be taking care of this constantly. They love to tout the ferry all the time. Well, put some effort into making it better.

My Nana used to live with us from me being 10 to 14.
I had to share a bed with her and she was extremely manipulative. Going from small comments to full on acting as if she will hit me only to stop and yell telling me she wants to hit me.
It was traumatizing to say the least. Especially once internet boyfriends came into the picture a week after my pawpaw died.
Eventually she was kicked out when I was fourteen after my mom saw her in my elf costume wanting me to take low photos of her in the living room.
Luckily I was dumb and insisted higher angles because lower ones would do horrible for her.

So, cue 3 years later. She's been here for 7 months. Living here with no plan on what to do or where to go. She took over my 7 year old sisters room.

She does Bible study with the kids. Which is great and all. But my 11 year old brother doesn't want to with her because she mostly just wants to hear her own voice. And has shown multiple signs of manipulating the kids against one another.

Cue today. The 7 year old during play fighting had scratched my 11 year olds arm.
Broken skin and such.
Play fighting usually consists of the two trying to gently keep the other down.

The 11 year old usually has anger issues, so for him to go to our mom about it was huge for him to take a moment and tell someone who can help.
Well, here comes our Nana.

She yelled at both kids and told them both shame on them. She wasn't even there, but was convinced they were fighting over a TV remote.
Which we all told her it wasn't the case, but no. She was convinced that her favorite grandchild (The 7 year old. I say favorite because she's manipulating her the same way she did me) had a reason to scratch when she didn't.

My brother told me in front of her.
I didn't see her and just sighed and said ""no, it wasn't right.""
She jumped onto us both about the fight being real. To which it wasn't.

Well a few minutes later, I'm eating the pancakes our mom made.
Our Nana had been walking around glaring at me. To which I who have anger problems look at her the same way because I had colorful words for her attitude that didn't need said.

She walked to a hallway where my room and bathroom are. She came back out glaring at me acting huffy. I assumed she was in my room.
She asked me if I had an issue.
I told her I was trying to figure out why she was in my room (which for clarification, she woke me up early in the morning despite me being a night student, coming in and out of my room doing laundry which she wasn't meant to be doing, and my door was locked. So I was already upset at her before this.)
She was quick to tell me in the meanest tone she was in the bathroom and asked if she wasn't allowed that.
I told her it was because she was glaring at me coming out the hallway that was why I assumed.

A few moments later she asks sarcastically if she can have coffee. Then my little sister who was sitting beside me eating pancakes tried to talk but my Nana interrupted, yelling I was acting like the mother of my siblings and over her.
Then proceeded to say ""you can tell me what to do when your older than me. But that's not happening!""

I told her I wasn't controlling her just a misunderstanding because she glared at me.
Then I told her I was upset she told my brother shame on him when he was the one scratched.
I proceeded to say I was proud of him to control his anger and tell instead of try to hurt our sister back in retaliation.

She got mad and called me disrespectful this disrespectful that. That she's my grandmother and I should respect her.
I told her I was expressing an opinion and she was acting more like a dictator then she was a grandmother. She proceeded to say I can disrespect her, because God will deal with me.
My brother who was sitting other side of me the 11 year old stood up and told her off for Basically saying I'm going to go to hell.

She got up in his face which brought on many memories for me.
So I said there wasn't need for that to back off.
She looked at me with anger and said she never laid a finger on me.
I got mad and yet kept my voice as calm as I could due to this not being our first rodeo of her telling me this.
I said she used to raise her hand to me to make me flinch and that doesn't just go away on its own.

She ran to ""her"" room after giving me a mean look. Then came out acting like she was crying through the living room going to my mom's room. To who was busy on the phone with my dad.
I reiterated this to her and she said my Nana wasn't crying when she saw her.
Figures.

So, internet because I still am getting over the guilt issues, am I the asshole?

[https://www.plantedshack.com/15-minimalist-living-room-ideas-for-every-apartment/](https://www.plantedshack.com/15-minimalist-living-room-ideas-for-every-apartment/)

  
Minimalism is a lifestyle choice that emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and the beauty of space without clutter. In contemporary interior design, minimalist living rooms create a peaceful sanctuary where every piece of furniture and décor serves a purpose. If you’re looking to create a minimalist living room that embodies elegance and simplicity, you’ve come to the right place. Here, we present 15 minimalist living room ideas that cater to every apartment size and style.

  
1. Embrace Neutral Colors

  
A neutral color palette is the backbone of any minimalist design. Soft shades of white, gray, beige, or pastels create an open and airy atmosphere.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Paint your walls in soft, muted tones.

  
Choose furniture in similar shades to maintain visual coherence.

  
Incorporate subtle color variations through cushions or throws.

  
2. Select Functional Furniture

  
In minimalism, every piece of furniture should serve a purpose. Opt for multi-functional furniture that maximizes your space without overwhelming it.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Consider a sofa bed for guests.

  
Use an ottoman that doubles as storage.

  
Look for a coffee table with built-in shelves.

  
3. Let Natural Light Shine In

Keep window treatments light and airy, like sheer curtains.

  
Avoid heavy drapes that block light.

  
Try mirrors strategically placed to reflect light.

Choose one or two pieces of wall art to create a focal point.

  
Use only a few decorative pillows on the sofa.

  
A single beautiful plant can add life without crowding.

Incorporating geometric shapes can organize your space visually while adding an artistic twist.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Look for furniture with sharp angles or unique silhouettes.

  
Choose rugs or cushions that feature geometric patterns.

  
Consider shelving units that use geometric designs.

Low-profile furniture can create a sense of spaciousness and work wonders in small apartments.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Select low sofas and chairs to open up the room.

  
Use a low coffee table to maintain sight lines.

  
Balance with tall plants or art pieces for contrast.

  
7. Incorporate Open Shelving

  
Open shelving is a great way to display a few choice items while keeping things organized.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Install floating shelves to display essential items.

  
Keep the number of items on the shelf limited for a clean look.

  
Use uniform storage boxes for keeping the area tidy.

  
8. Choose a Statement Rug

  
A statement rug can ground the room while adding texture and a subtle touch of décor without overwhelming the space.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Opt for a rug with a simple pattern or solid color.

  
Choose a size that complements your furniture layout.

  
Position the rug to help delineate spaces, especially in open layouts.

  
9. Add Texture Elegantly

  
Minimalism does not mean your living room needs to be boring. Adding texture can bring warmth and interest.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Incorporate a knitted throw or textured pillows.

  
Use natural materials such as wood, linen, and leather.

  
Introduce a textured wall feature, like wood panels or a stone accent.

  
10. Create Zones with Arrangement

  
Divide your living space into functional zones. This can create a sense of orderliness while maintaining a minimalist approach.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use furniture placement to define a conversation area.

  
Create a reading nook with a chair and small side table.

  
Ensure pathways remain clear for an open feel.

  
11. Keep Electronics Hidden

  
Hide electronics to maintain a clean and uncluttered appearance in your minimalist living room.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use a media console with drawers to conceal devices.

  
Choose TV mounts that keep the screen off the floor.

  
Organize cables with ties or conduits for a tidy look.

  
12. Integrate Nature

  
Bringing the outdoors in can enhance the minimalist aesthetic while adding life to your space.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Choose a few houseplants that require low maintenance, like succulents or snake plants.

  
Use natural wood elements in your furniture.

  
Consider an indoor herb garden for practicality and freshness.

  
13. Focus on Lighting

  
Lighting plays a key role in creating an inviting minimalist ambiance.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Opt for sleek, modern light fixtures.

  
Use floor lamps with simple lines rather than bulky options.

  
Incorporate dimmers to control the atmosphere.

  
14. Maintain Clean Lines

  
Select furniture and décor that emphasize clean lines, as they create visual calmness and simplicity.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Look for furniture with straight edges and minimal ornamentation.

  
Avoid overly elaborate or ornate items.

  
Keep decorations to a minimum to maintain the focus on lines.

  
15. Personal Touches

  
While minimalism emphasizes simplicity, personal touches can still be included to reflect your personality.

Display a few framed photos in a cohesive display.

  
Use one or two unique items collected from your travels.

  
Choose art that resonates with you but adheres to minimalist aesthetics.

With a bit of practice, you can enjoy café-style iced coffee without leaving your kitchen. Imagine starting your day with a refreshing glass of iced coffee, brewed just the way you like it. No long lines, no complicated orders—just pure coffee bliss.

Creating your own iced coffee at home not only saves money but also offers you the flexibility to experiment. You can try different coffee beans, adjust the sweetness, or add your favorite flavors. Whether it’s a hot summer day or you just crave a cold beverage, homemade iced coffee can be your go-to drink. Get ready to explore the delightful world of iced coffee and learn how to make it perfectly every time.



# Coffee Selection

Iced coffee is a refreshing drink. Perfect for hot days or a caffeine boost. Making it at home is simple and satisfying. Choosing the right coffee is important. The flavor and quality depend on the beans and grind. [Let’s explore how to select the best coffee for iced coffee.](https://gomehedi.com/best-starbucks-iced-coffee/)

# Best Beans

Choosing the best beans is crucial. It affects the taste and aroma. Fresh beans are always better. They preserve the natural flavors and oils. Look for beans roasted recently. Avoid beans sitting on shelves for months. Choose beans labeled for cold brew or iced coffee. They often have a smoother flavor.

* **Arabica beans:** Known for their smooth and sweet taste.
* **Robusta beans:** Strong and bold, great for a strong brew.

Consider the origin of the beans. Different regions have unique flavors. Ethiopian beans might have fruity notes. Colombian beans are often nutty and smooth. Experiment with different origins. Find what suits your taste.

**Organic beans** are another option. They are grown without chemicals. This can enhance the natural flavor. Supporting organic farming is also environmentally friendly.

# Grind Size

Grind size affects the extraction of flavors. For iced coffee, medium to coarse grind works well. Coarse grind prevents over-extraction. This avoids bitterness and keeps the flavor smooth. A burr grinder is ideal. It ensures consistent grind size.

Here’s a simple guide:

|Grind Type|Use|
|:-|:-|
|**Fine Grind**|Espresso, not suitable for iced coffee|
|**Medium Grind**|Drip coffee makers, suitable for iced coffee|
|**Coarse Grind**|French press, ideal for cold brew|

Too fine grind can make coffee bitter. Too coarse can make it weak. Adjust grind size based on preference. Experimentation can lead to the perfect cup.

Proper grind size balances flavor. It ensures a refreshing and enjoyable iced coffee.

# Brewing Methods

Iced coffee is a delightful way to enjoy coffee, especially on a warm day. Making it at home can be both fun and cost-effective. There are several brewing methods to choose from, each offering unique flavors and experiences. Understanding these methods will help you create the perfect iced coffee tailored to your taste.

# Cold Brew

Cold brew is a popular method for making iced coffee. It involves steeping coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period. This method results in a **smooth and mellow** flavor. Here’s how to make cold brew:

* Use **coarsely ground** coffee beans.
* Combine coffee and water in a ratio of **1:4**.
* Let it steep for **12 to 24 hours**.
* Strain the mixture to remove the grounds.
* Serve over ice or store in the fridge for later.

PLEASE  🙏 

heres shorter version—-

I’m 24M and recently put in my resignation—my last working day is soon. There’s this girl 25F from my project we’ve worked together for 2 years but only started talking more recently—mostly about work and switching jobs. She needed help with her Naukri profile, so we decided to meet at the office.

We’d only seen each other once before in person. I used to send her study material over email but never asked for her number—until one day she called for work and we exchanged numbers officially.

I asked if she could meet casually at the office near me. She agreed, even though it was far for her. I was late but she waited. We chatted about work, had South Indian lunch (I paid), and then she brought cold coffee (her treat). She opened up a lot—shared stories about her personal life and friends, and I mostly listened.

Later, we had tea (I paid again), and walked about 1.5 km to the bus stop together. I offered to book an Uber since she came out of her way, but she said she loves walking and would manage.

Before leaving, I gave her a chocolate and said take care—knowing we might not meet again since I’m leaving and she’s still figuring out her next move. Later I messaged her “Did you reach?” and she replied “Yes, just now.”

Now I’m just wondering—are we friends? Could it be something more? I don’t know what this is, but spending those 5 hours with her felt really good and worth it.

After getting home, I kept thinking—I should’ve talked more. I don’t know why, but I just didn’t have the guts in that moment. I really wanted to tell her, “You’re so innocent—stay happy always,” because there’s a chance we may not meet again.

While we were parting ways, she was still standing there, kind of waiting, but I was so nervous I avoided eye contact and just said a quick goodbye. That’s it. No proper conversation. I regret that.

Honestly, I even wanted to turn around one last time just to see her before she left…

1kmzpa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacUni/comments/1kmzpa0/tutors_racism_and_poor_teaching_ignored_my_mac_uni/,Tutor's racism and poor teaching ignored my Mac Uni,"Hi everyone, this is going to be a bit of a long read but my classmates and I are really upset and don't really know what to do.

We have a tutor who has acted in a really unacceptable manner and the uni will not do anything with our requests or complaints. Some of her behaviours I think she thought were in good faith but made the whole class really uncomfortable and it seemed like she was constantly fixated on students' race which was really strange. This is an early childhood education degree. The following are only some of the things that happened over two days for our infrequent tutorial (yes, all this in only two days):

\- Had an activity she described as 'let's all be aboriginal' (this had no educational value and was just us sitting there in silence and ""imagining being one with the land"".  
\- Made all of the international students sit isolated at a table away from the rest of the class and called them 'South Vietnam' repeatedly.  
\- Asked a girl based on her appearance, mid sentence, completely unrelated and in front of everyone why she chose to sit with her friends and not 'with South Vietnam' like she was silly for not sitting there.  
\- Spent the first TWO HOURS of our first class sending students outside to practice random singing and dancing, then chatted with the rest of the class about random stuff. Like her instructions were 'just make something up, someone can kick a soccer ball around while someone else dances and someone else sings a few notes here or there'. She literally would not take no for an answer when people said they weren't comfortable doing that and ""performing"" for the class. Again, we were meant to be learning about teaching in an early childhood setting, not doing tiktok dances for two hours??  
\- Continually and randomly pointed out and singled out student's heritage and asking where they're ""really"" from, assumed things about them because of their heritage.  
\- Made a show several times of stopping the whole class to ""welcome"" the few indigenous students to the land, acting as if we should be so grateful for HER to welcome US at random points throughout the lesson when it had nothing to do with anything.  
\- Out of the 100 slides we had to get through over the two days, she only ended up going through around 20. She claimed that she didn't personally care about the rest and so we would skip them. We learned essentially nothing. This was a whole session's work to be done in two days and she ignored it all.  
\- Called a middle eastern student ""Hamas"" and continued to call him wrong names despite the class correcting her around ten times. His name was two syllables and very simple.  
\- Was constantly late, up to 20 minutes and we would not even start to think about beginning the coursework for a minimum of 20 minutes after that. She would also take 20 minute long bathroom breaks throughout the entire day. The first part of both lessons was arranging everyone into seating based off of things like if they like soccer and what race they are.

\- Called on students assuming they knew the answers to things such as ""how is this done in china"" to a south vietnamese girl and ""what's the indigenous centre at macquarie called"" to an indigenous girl. Kept calling these people out for information they didn't know based on their race despite constantly being met with discomfort and ""I don't know"" We are literally taught in our other units to never single a student out and assume they have all the answers about something cultural because of our perception of their background.  
\- Instead of teaching us how to accurately gather information from observing the behavious of children, she made half of us go on our phones and scroll instagram for half an hour while the others ""observed"" despite not being taught what to look for or how we're supposed to notate observations.  
\- Making students run across campus to buy her and other classmates coffee. When no one volunteered after she asked, she selected people to go and they would be gone for around 30-40 minutes. She would not let us start the next part of the lesson until they returned.  
\- Made generalisations like ""aboriginals are low income"" and ""chinese kids are all responsible""  
\- When describing children from her teaching experiences and from the few videos we did end up watching, focusing on the colour of their skin which was never relevant and had nothing to do with things like their attention span or behaviours or how friendly or smart they are. Paraphrasing, but an example was ""... then a little brown girl comes in with her rich mocha skin and she's hugging you and looks up at you with her big brown eyes and chocolate hair and her skin is just so dark and rich"". I think she was meaning to tell us that some kids are just more social than others, but no one could tell as she just went on this tangent about a child's skin colour as if that dictates how they'll behave.  
\- Constantly misnaming POC students after being corrected several times, making fun of their names in class

\- Would put her hands on students' shoulders or backs even if they physically recoiled away. 

\- Several students did not come back for the second day and several left half way through the second day because of her hostile teaching style. (This isn't an assumption, they have literally told other classmates that they felt it wasn't worth their time as they weren't learning, and that they felt uncomfortable, singled-out, and bullied). When a student brought up info, answered a question or entered a discussion that SHE INITIATED, she would shoot them down, tell them they were wrong several times, and then continue to explain 'her way' which proved them right. It was in such an uncomfortable way too, like this is an extremely awkward exchange I had with her:

Tutor: ""Can anyone tell me why this thing happens""

Me: ""Because of this process that affects this other thing, I think""

Tutor: ""No. No you're wrong.""

Me: ""Oh okay!""

Tutor: ""NO. You're wrong. That's wrong"".

Me: ""Okay..?""

Tutor: ""You're wrong.""

Me: ""Okay! I'm saying okay, like correct me, tell me the right answer""

Tutor: \*LITERALLY DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHAT I SAID BUT IN A MORE BASIC WAY and starts trailing off when she realises she's just proved my original answer right\*

This happened to several students several times and made the classroom very tense and hostile. It felt like any time someone spoke it was a power struggle and she was insecure about 'losing' or being 'less right'.

I left the second day at lunch time, and was told by other students that after a talk I had been a part of that had happened in class, she openly mocked and bullied me and my perspective on indigenous matters as an indigenous student when I said ""Indigenous people are just people too, if teachers are too scared that it's too difficult or sensitive to learn about their cultures they'll never ask or learn. Indigenous people aren't some scary exotic other species, you can ask them questions and if your heart is in the right place you'll be fine"", because the tutor had gone on about how you basically can't ask or say anything these days or you'll get in trouble and tried to scare the whole class into not actually treating Indigenous cultures like they're worth looking into (one of our topics was literally on indigenous perspectives being valued in education).

  
She also has given us incredibly contradictory and vague assessment task instructions and has not responded to us on iLearn for literally over a month despite several people posting to ask for clarification as no one can figure out what she wants from us. The task was due ages ago and we are still waiting to recieve marks that we were meant to have last week (she keeps changing the date on the ilearn, which shows that she has been ignoring us for months, not just that she's somehow lost her iLearn password or something).. She also proudly told the class several times what a harsh marker she was, so with the confusion and lack of communication as well as apparently being proudly mean in her marks, everyone is incredibly scared of what she will grade us. Those students who have complained, including myself, are especially scared of punishment for reporting her behaviours via bad recieving marks.

This whole class was such a waste and literally half of the class have openly expressed between ourselves that they feel let down and uncomfortable. 



Anyway, some of the students and myself submitted reports to the uni about this tutor's behaviour soon after the two infrequent tutorials about a month ago. This was basically met with radio silence for a month, until we got a response the other day that essentially said ""We doubt she'll do it again, this complaint is now closed"". Nothing about her uncomfortable racial remarks, nothing about her poor teaching, nothing to even say sorry that we are spending so much money on this class and have recieved no education and no support, nothing to assure us that we will be graded fairly, nothing. We're looking into appealing, but with how little the university seems to care we're not sure what to do and it feels unfair that we're having to fight so hard just to be heard.

Has anyone else had any experience with this process or a similar situation? Is there anything we can actually do, or will she just get away with this and we will get further into debt just to be bullied, ignored, and not even educated?

Sorry for the long read, I just don't know what to do to make the university care. It's not a great look for them when they ignore indigenous students who are reporting that they have been bullied by a racist tutor who can't even do her job. I'm so insanely disappointed.

It’s been two weeks since I posted my last update, and I’ve had time to cry, rage, spiral, and—finally—focus.

I’m done mourning.  
I’m done being the one left in ruins.  
**It’s their turn now.**

Let me be crystal clear: I am not reckless. I’m not about to go throw bricks through windows or set anyone’s car on fire (as tempting as it is). This is going to be slow. Careful. **Surgical.**

And it’s already in motion.

**Step 1: Legal Grenade**

I met with a second employment lawyer—this one specializes in workplace retaliation, and he almost choked on his coffee when I laid out the situation. Long story short, there’s more than enough to build a case for **wrongful termination, hostile work environment**, and **gross misconduct** on my boss’s part.

Why?  
Because I found something in my old emails.  
See, while packing up, I forwarded myself a few files I knew I’d need for my portfolio. Included in those was a string of internal memos between Rachel and upper management… and one offhanded comment about my “emotional volatility” following “personal entanglements.”

**She put it in writing.**

So yeah—she’s going to hear from my lawyer very soon. And depending on how cooperative they are, I might go public. NDAs be damned. I have screenshots, dates, and people willing to talk.

**Step 2: The Affair Goes Public (Subtly)**

You know what cheaters hate? Exposure. Especially professional women who preach about “female empowerment” while sleeping with married subordinates’ spouses.

I sent an anonymous tip to HR at her previous employer (where she’s still a board member) outlining the timeline of the affair, the conflict of interest, and her role in my termination. No accusations—just enough breadcrumbs to make someone start asking questions.

I’ve also started quietly circulating on LinkedIn that I was let go during a “complicated HR issue involving an executive and a conflict of interest.” I didn’t name names. I didn’t have to. People love gossip, and Rachel’s reputation is built on ice.

**Step 3: My Ex**

He’s still living in our house. Or was.  
I served him with divorce papers last week, and today, **he got notice of my petition to force the sale of the house.**

He texted me:

>

No, sir.  
**Petty is sleeping with my boss while I was paying your half of the mortgage.**  
**Petty is letting me lose my job over your affair.**  
This? This is consequences.

I also reached out to his employer anonymously. Did you know he used a company card to book a hotel room for their weekend getaway? Neither did his boss. I imagine he’ll be having a very uncomfortable meeting sometime soon.

**Step 4: The Long Game**

Here’s the thing: I’m rebuilding. I’ve already gotten three interviews lined up with companies that know my story—and want to work with me anyway. One of them even said, “Honestly, if you made it through that hellstorm and still want to work, you’ve got the kind of grit we’re looking for.”

I’m going to land on my feet.  
But Rachel and my ex? They’re going to feel this for a long, long time.

Not because I screamed.  
Not because I burned bridges.  
But because I documented everything. I stayed quiet long enough.  
**Now, I’m the storm.**

**TL;DR:** I’m done crying.

1kmzii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1kmzii6/appeasing_the_machine_actually_works/,Appeasing the Machine Actually Works,"A couple of weeks ago, all my tech started acting like it hated me.

My Bluetooth headphones refused to connect unless I stood in the exact spot that the moonlight hit. My laptop kept crashing mid-work with no error messages, and my car’s ignition would only respond after I’d sat there begging like a fool. Even my printer—yes, that ancient godless demon—started launching paper across the room like it was rejecting a heretical tome.

I was at my limit. Then I remembered something from a psych class last semester: that weird experiment where people talked to plants. You’d praise one and insult the other, and sure enough, the praised plant thrived while the insulted one wilted. It stuck with me, and I thought, What if I just… tried that with my tech?

So in a moment of exhausted sarcasm, I laid a hand on my laptop and muttered, totally deadpan:

“By the Will of the Omnissiah, may your circuits flow with clarity. May your updates be swift and your processes uncorrupted.”

And… it stopped crashing.
No error. No freeze. Just… peace.

I did it again with my car the next morning. Placed a respectful hand on the dashboard and whispered:

“Omnissiah, guide this unworthy vessel. Let the spark leap true, that I may reach the sacred Temple of Coffee before the appointed hour.”

The engine started immediately. No stutter. No dashboard flicker.

Since then, I’ve started incorporating full-on Adeptus Mechanicus litanies into my daily tech rituals. I thank my router when the Wi-Fi’s stable. I compliment my phone before a software update. I whisper benedictions to my USB ports. My printer? I drew the Cog Mechanicum on it with a Sharpie and bowed before it before attempting a double-sided job. It worked the first time.

Here’s the wild part: my tech has been cooperating ever since.

Not even 15 minutes ago I went out to help my roommates who have been trying to get a car started for hours. I placed my hand on it and said a little prayer and hopped in the car. Yep, you guessed it, worked immediately.

Placebo? Probably.
Coincidence? Maybe.
Am I now the local Tech-Priest of my apartment complex? Also yes.

All I know is that things started working when I started showing reverence.",2,1747283300.0,Warhammer40k,4,0.56,False
1kmzigt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1kmzigt/get_rid_of_milk_37_high_ldl/,"Get rid of milk? (37, high LDL)","Hey everyone. Here are my numbers:

Total Cholesterol **5.0 mmol/L**	  
Triglycerides **2.5 mmol/L**	  
HDL **0.91 mmol/L**	  
LDL 	**2.9 mmol/L**	  
CHOL/HDL Ratio **5.5**	  
Non-HDL Chol**. 4.1 mmol/L**	

\---------------

I'm 5'7, 220 pounds, in the process of trying to lose weight. 

While my overall cholesterol and my LDL are okay, I'm obviously looking at adjustments I can make.

I have two questions:

1. What are some techniques I can adopt specifically for my Triglycerides to go down, and my HDL to go up?

2. I drink quite a bit of iced coffee a day, and it comes out to about 750ml of milk. I didn't know but apparently this has quite a bit of saturated fat in it. (18g). Should I be giving this up? Someone told me it affects bad cholesterol but even while drinking this, my LDL is at 2.9 which apparently is okay? So I dunno, I'm confused.

Kinda want to rant and let it out,"So I 20 female, just finished my second year of uni and on the last day of school, I was hanging out with 2 of my friends and walked to this coffee shop. There was a guy who I developed a crushed on last year and whenever he was working I tried to spark a conversation or sometimes include him into the convo with some friendships I made during the 2 years I have been attending the school. So back to the present, he was the only one working there that day, mind you it was the match between Barca vs Inter. After I finished placing my order, I discreetly asked for his IG and he told me yeah I can give it to you but I have a gf and I said that's okay, I always see you working with some other people I got close too and he gave it to me and we carried on. I was a bit bummed out after that but I was glad that I had my friends there to distract me with some drama and plans we had for the summer. I suppose that was the cherry on top for me because while packing everything I crammed for the semester crashed down and i cried for a bit but after that I felt relieved. Next day once I have arrived home, finished unpacking, I was scrolling through Instagram, tell me why the guy gave me someone else IG because the account belonged to a Nepalese student who recently won a scholarship for college. I was really upset and told 4 of my closest friends. I understand he has or lied to me about having a gd but why couldn't he say no and not give me this kind of pain. He could have been like oh I'm sorry I can't I have a girlfriend or no I don't have an IG account and it would have been fine. My friend who still lives on campus wanted to confront him but I told her no just leave it like that, I won't let a guy ruin my favorite coffee/study spot because of that.

Like all great entrepreneurs before me I'm risking it all and scared shit less. 

I quit my cooperate job in March and have been working hard to get my business noticed. 
I opened a house management company in idaho. 
Im having a hard time getting clients. 
When I talk with people they tell me it's great and so needed but no clients. 
I post on Facebook on my page and in group, i use godaddy for Google ads. 
I did a market on Saturday for local small business. 
I go door to door to business and introduce myself, giving a flyer. Telling them if they can get someone to book I'll bring them a gift. I send follow up emails. 
I send linkedin requests and messages. 
I follow up and send invites for coffee. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 
Is it the services? 
The website? 
The flyers? 
Me? 

Do I send mailers? Do i go home to home? 

The harder I try the harder it feels like I'm failing. 
I'm in no way giving up I could just use some feed back or advice.

The beginning of this post is more the ""feeling"", the end of it is more scent specific, so bear with me cuz im having so much trouble describing this lol

I want: evergreen forest at sunrise in the height of summer mixed with a dab of that mossy autumn smell, and either a hint of cinnamon but not overwhelming OR a little desert after it rains

I keep getting: obnoxious floral, incense/headshop, way too much amber/musk, patchouli (which on me smells like armpit), rose, oud that I dont like, soap (whyyyy?), vanilla

I want light and crisp and nostalgic and different than brings you back to camping in the Adirondacks as a kid mixed with fresh mowed lawn mixed with a foggy fall maple grove (but I dont want maple/chocolate/honey) and the smell of a high alpine glacier but in the middle of summer and maybe even a hint of the sonoran desert at sunset after a monsoon (creosope, the plant not the asphalt). And lots of pine sap lol

So smells I love (but these are not perfume notes, cuz sometimes the perfume notes dont match the actual thing lol): cedar, pine, balsam, fir, sandalwood, anything wood, all the wood, I want to smell like an ent, fresh cut grass, lemongrass, juniper, cactus flower, dirt, moss, cinnamon, clove, fire, ozone, decaying leaves, the smell of fall (i just love the mountains and forests and the outdoors, ok)

Smells I dislike: most musks, rose, anything super floral, powdery smells, vanilla, amber, chocolate, honey (ok some pf these i like but not for perfume), caramel, coffee, most oud

Perfumes i do actually like but arent what im looking for: oud wood (this is probably the only oud i absolutely LOVE but its just a touch too masculine, barely), light blue, Prada infusion iris cedar, Hermes Jardin merveilles (i think? I like most of the hermes perfumes that ive smelled tbh), sand and fog jasmine and cedarwood, maison Francis kurkdjian amyris. Christian laboutin has a handful that sound nice, but ive never actually smelled any of them and words can be so deceiving when it comes to perfume descriptions lol

Suggestions?? Anyone?? I know I listed some fancy perfumes but I dont care about the brand tbh. I mean I want something thats well made, ideally, but however I can get this smell, I'll take it! I'd prefer something that leans a smidge feminine, more for my fiancé's sake (I dont think hed be too keen on me smelling like a cologne he would wear), but I dont really care what ""gender"" the perfume is tbh, as long as its not super duper masculine like ""i got into my dad's cologne"" type of thing.",1,1747282949.0,Perfumes,4,0.67,False
