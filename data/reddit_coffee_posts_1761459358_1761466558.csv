1ogf342,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ogf342/can_i_have_adhd_despite_having_really_good_grades/,Can I have ADHD despite having really good grades?,"I have always felt that I have ADHD but I always doubted it because I m a very good student academic wise. I was previously diagnosed with depression when I was 15 and I m currently 17 now. My home is kinda meh, it’s usually calm but I m not close to my parents. I don’t think they particularly like me either, they just care for me because I m a good student and fulfill their expectations. Other than that, my mother probably wouldn’t have any good words for me. 

Here’s why I think I might have ADHD. I get distracted very fast while studying. I can somehow force myself to study for an hour and sometimes when I get REALLY motivated I end up studying for 3-4 hours. But it’s just a short burst of energy that eventually goes away after a while. I have to force myself to sit or I just end up looking at my phone and studying alongside cause I m distracted. I feel constantly restless, I don’t know if it’s cause of anxiety or cause I m always busy with studying. I constantly move my legs to the point that ppl in my scl also notice it and tell me to stop moving my legs so much. I speak too much in front of people sometimes and end up cutting them off (EVEN WHEN I DONT WANT TO), I do end up apologizing though. I always feel in a rush to do things. I don’t know if I m impulsive, but I have made very wrong decisions due to not think too deep. This has directly affected my mental health due to the consequences.

I m still in school and my parents don’t care abt my mental health. Even when I was depressed, my mother berated me real bad for that. I can only maybe get diagnosed once I m in college but we’ll see that. Despite all of these problems, I however am a very good student. My daily study time is around 3-4 hours and I think it could be more if I didn’t get distracted and tired every few mins after drinking coffee. This is so frustrating.",0,1761466252.0,ADHD,1,0.5,False
1ogf1xq,https://v.redd.it/2orf5im4zexf1,Thoughts on extraction and advice?,"Hello everyone. 
I am new to the whole Gaggia universe, I bought the E24 based on its exceptional reviews, however I don’t think I’m using it right and it annoys me deeply. 

Firstly, I don’t think I’ve pulled any good coffee until now. As you can see, the extraction is uneven, it’s been like this from the beginning. I’d like to buy a naked porta filter, but I don’t know which would be good. 

Secondly, I’m using a Eureka Mignon manuale to grind the beans, yet I don’t think I have the best grind setting (tho so far, the current one is the best I could set). I bought coffee from a specialty cafe and they grounded it for me and it tasted a whole lot better. 

I don’t think I’m tampering the coffee right. I ordered WDT and I’m waiting for it to arrive, but so far I’m improvising with thin things to make it even. I don’t know how much pressure I should put when I tamper it. I’m afraid if I tamper too hard, the coffee won’t come out. But I know that if I don’t do it sufficiently hard, it will be too watery and tasteless 

I am open to any criticism, advice and thoughts. I want to get better at this and I want to drink good coffee. 

Why I’m so annoyed is that the store-bought ground coffee I make at my mother’s Delonghi Dedica Arte (which I got her last Christmas) tastes better than the coffee I make with my Gaggia. I was hoping to get coffee as good as specialty cafés around my town, but so far I’m not making coffee any better than the Nespresso I had before. 

Thank you for reading all this and I’m looking to improve, so I’ll accept any suggestions. ",1,1761466119.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

I don’t really have much of a local network or friends who share the same interest in coffee, so I thought I’d see if anyone around here might be up for meeting sometime — maybe for a casual coffee chat, cafe crawl, or even roasting experiments.

1ogez12,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelpNY/comments/1ogez12/the_fast_essay_writing_service_that_actually/,The Fast Essay Writing Service That Actually Works – My Experience with PapersRoo,"Let’s be honest - writing an essay in one night sounds like a total nightmare, but it’s something every student faces at some point. I’ve been there more times than I’d like to admit. Back in my first year, I thought I was just bad at time management - turns out, most of us are just overloaded.

Now that I tutor and help other students, I keep hearing the same thing: they need a way to finish essays fast without spiraling into panic mode. Over time, I’ve figured out some real strategies that actually work when you’re in a “write-my-paper-at-2AM” situation. And when even that’s not enough, I point people to *PapersRoo* \- a fast essay writing service that’s actually built for those last-minute, one-night-before-the-deadline kind of moments.

If you’re staring down a blank Google Doc and asking yourself how to write an essay in 1 night, I’ve got some honest, field-tested tips - and a solid backup plan.

I’ve got some honest, field-tested tips - and a solid backup plan. Trust me, once you know how to write a paper fast, you’ll never panic over a deadline the same way again.

# Quick Essay Hacks That Actually Help

Here’s what I do when I’ve gotta finish an essay in one night (yes, it's possible, no, you won’t love it):

* **Start with a quick outline.** 3 mins max. Intro > 3 Body Points > Conclusion. Boom. No overthinking.
* **Use voice-to-text. Seriously.** Talk your ideas out loud into Google Docs. You’d be surprised how fast ideas flow when you're not typing.
* **Sources first.** Grab 2-3 solid ones, plug in quotes, and build paragraphs around them.
* Pomodoro it. 25 mins writing, 5 mins break. No TikTok till you're done. I mean it.

But sometimes, even that doesn’t cut it. You’re fried. The brain says “nope.” And that’s where the real MVP came in…

# Enter: PapersRoo - The Fast Essay Writing Service You’ve Never Heard Of (But Should’ve)

I stumbled on PapersRoo after one too many coffee-powered panic nights. Honestly, what grabbed me? The speed.

[**Site Link**](https://essay.watch/SMRTZh?type=28)

They have this “3-hour turnaround” option - and not like, some draft, but the whole freakin' essay polished and ready to go. You pick the topic, length, style (MLA/APA/whatever your prof is obsessed with), and they roll with it.

I tried it once for a 1,500-word psych paper I kept pushing off. Thought I’d just get a rough version to tweak. Instead, I got something I could actually submit - and I wasn’t pulling my hair out at 4 AM wondering if I'd cited Freud wrong.

# My Take: Sometimes You Just Need a Little Backup

I tell students this all the time: it's not about being lazy, it’s about being strategic.  
Deadlines don’t care if your brain is in sleep mode or your laptop just decided to update mid-paragraph.

Using a service like PapersRoo doesn’t make you a slacker. It just means you’re being real about your workload. It saved me more than once - especially when I had two essays, a quiz, and a roommate drama situation all in one week.

>💡**Pro tip:** Pair it with Grammarly + Google Scholar for checking sources and polishing final edits.  
Also, if you need citations fast? Zotero is clutch. (And free.)

# TL;DR – You’ve Got Options, Don’t Panic

* If you’re wondering how to write an essay fast or just googled “write my essay fast” with tears in your eyes - I see you. I’ve been you.
* You’ve got tools. You’ve got hacks. And if it comes down to it, you’ve got PapersRoo. Don’t make it harder than it needs to be.
* Also: if anyone figures out how to make APA citations less annoying… please start a petition.

Stay strong out there. And don’t wait till 2 AM to open the assignment again. You know better. 😉",1,1761465805.0,homeworkhelpNY,20,1.0,False

I could use an outside perspective.

I (35F) recently came out of a 12-year relationship. Earlier this year, I got involved with a coworker (42M). It started as something physical, we’d only hook up at work events, no contact in between. The chemistry was insane, but we never talked about what it was.

After I burned out and took some time off work, he reached out again. We slowly started talking more, and last week, he asked me out properly, dinner and drinks.
On the date, we had a great time: laughed a lot, kissed in the bar, even met some of his friends by coincidence. I ended up staying the night. He made coffee and breakfast in the morning, and later said he’d like to cook me dinner one day.

Since then, he’s texted a little, sent a photo from a hockey game, but he’s still not super consistent.
He’s flirty, warm, and comfortable with me, but doesn’t open up emotionally. I can’t tell if he’s just keeping it casual, or if this was his way of showing he wants more.

I’m trying not to overthink, but after everything we’ve been through, I can’t tell what’s real and what’s just habit or comfort for him.

So, based on this dynamic, what do you think he’s thinking or feeling?
Is this just convenience and attraction, or could there actually be something more here?",1,1761465797.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

We spoke almost every single day and had great banter. Yesterday we finally got the chance to meet up and we went to a pub. Our conversation was great and I really thought there was some sort of chemistry. When the time came to pay, he said he’ll go pay it but then we can just split it later. I told him we should just split the bill but he said no I can pay him later. Then I said sure okay. As we were leaving, I asked him if he had payid and he said yeah. The total came to $90 so he said to give him like $30 or something. Anyway, i realised I didn’t want to payid him (privacy reasons) the money and was looking for an atm so i could give cash. 

As we were walking around the city, i was keeping an eye out for an atm. I couldn’t find one, so I told him I would just buy him things to make up for my half of the food we ate at the pub. We decided to buy iced coffee and I paid for that. Then I bought him some dessert he could take home. Then we played claw machines games which I spent another $20 on. And then lastly I got us more drinks for a juice place. 

Anyway, I’m all for splitting bills but the whole situation made me feel so uneasy. I won’t lie I am a bit traditional and I do prefer the man to pay, at least on the first few dates. But I kind of do like him so I’m just not sure if what he did means he doesn’t like me? Oh another thing, as we were parting ways, we went in for a hug and I accidentally said “it was nice knowing you” instead of saying it was nice hanging out. Anyway, once I got home, he messaged me and said he had a great time but my last comment threw him off. I told him I said that by mistake and we continued talking like normal. We spoke a fair bit earlier today but have had no conversation since then. 

Am I just overreacting? I don’t really mind about splitting bills, esp because I do like him. But it’s kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. ",1,1761465751.0,dating_advice,15,0.6,False

1ogev1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNarrativeSub/comments/1ogev1c/the_boy_they_laughed_at/,The Boy They Laughed At,"The township of Soweto was alive every morning with the noise of taxis, laughter of children, and the chaos of survival.
In one forgotten corner, there lived a young boy named Lerato Mokoena — a name that meant love, though life had rarely shown him any.

Lerato grew up in a tiny shack made of rusted zinc, where the sound of rain leaking through holes was a lullaby he had long grown used to. His mother, Mama Dineo, sold vetkoeks at the corner near the taxi rank, and his father had disappeared when Lerato was just seven.

Their mornings began before the sun even woke. Lerato would help his mother prepare a bucket of fruits and pastries to sell at the station. With his torn school shoes and faded shirt, he’d push the heavy cart down the gravel road, his hands blistered and his stomach often empty.

At school, the struggle continued. His classmates mocked him for wearing the same clothes every day, for not owning a smartphone, and for never joining them at the mall.

“Yoh, look at Lerato,” they laughed.
“Maybe if you had money, girls would notice you.”

And they were right — no one did.
When Lerato tried to speak to girls, they’d giggle and say, “You’re sweet, but you’re not my type.”
Their “type” was someone with a car, fancy sneakers, and a nice cologne — not a boy who smelled of fruit and sweat.

But Lerato didn’t let the rejection break him.
Each insult became fuel. Each humiliation — a reminder of why he needed to rise.

After school, he refused to hang around like others. He’d rush to help his mother sell, and when the day ended, he’d stay up late, reading business books he borrowed from a teacher who believed in him.

> “One day, Mama,” he’d whisper,
“I’ll buy you a real house. You won’t sell by the roadside again.”

- The Turning Point -

When Lerato finished high school, he didn’t have money for university.
But he had vision.

He began selling fruits at a bigger scale — waking up at 3 AM to buy from the market and reselling to vendors at taxi ranks. He carried crates with his bare hands until his shoulders ached.
When others gave up because profits were small, he kept going.

Slowly, word spread. People began trusting him for fresh produce and honest prices. He saved every coin he made — not for luxury, but for growth.

With time, he bought a small bakkie.
That bakkie became his pride — the first sign that his hard work was not in vain.

He began supplying schools, small shops, and local restaurants. Within a few years, Mokoena Fresh Supplies was born — a company he started with nothing but grit and hunger.

He hired workers from his community, gave back to the people who once mocked him, and built a warehouse that stood as a symbol of how far he had come.

- The Day of Glory -

One bright Saturday, Lerato drove into town in a sleek black Mercedes-Benz GLC.
He parked outside the same café where many of his old schoolmates often gathered.

Inside, laughter filled the air — and among the crowd were the same girls who once called him “broke boy.”

They didn’t recognize him at first. His sharp suit, confidence, and calm aura made him unrecognizable.

When one of them finally realized who he was, her voice trembled,

> “Wait… is that Lerato?”
All eyes turned. Silence.

He smiled — not arrogantly, but peacefully — and greeted them politely.

> “It’s good to see familiar faces,” he said.

They couldn’t find the words. Their laughter had turned to admiration. Their mockery had turned into envy.

When Lerato paid for his coffee, he also covered the entire table’s bill.
As he was leaving, he turned to them and said softly,

> “You see, life has seasons. Never look down on someone just because they’re still in their winter. Spring always comes.”

- Epilogue -

That night, Lerato drove back to Soweto — not to flaunt his success, but to visit his mother.
He found her sitting outside their new brick house, built by his own hands.

“Mama,” he said, smiling, “we made it.”
She hugged him tightly, tears in her eyes.
The same boy who once walked barefoot to town was now the man who built hope from dust
Never underestimate anyone because of their current situation. Life changes. People grow. The same person you laugh at today might become the person you wish you had supported tomorrow.
Hard work, patience, and faith turn pain into power.

All I really remember about the plot was that the boy was adopted by his grandfather? Or maybe it was their great uncle. This distant relative becomes the only person who’s ever raised the boy kindly.

For Christmas the boy wants to get the relative a present and uses a credit card number he memorized at a coffee shop because the card owner repeatedly showed it off almost everyday while making their coffee order. I think they bought a jacket online as the present. 

The relative also gives the boy a present. It was a used laptop but it was the boy’s first ever computer.

We got along very well and i'm also good friend with their partner. We passed the last months like friends with benefits, and a lot of deep connection. I have kinda of a crush on them but I've never been poly before, I started informing myself about the theme and i actually find it interesting, so I decided to try it. (disclaimer: 1. we are both not ready for a relationship and decided to take a step back and keep up being friends with benefits for a while longer. 2. in this four months they never had any affair nor situationship, they would just hang out with their 2 partners and i was totally fine with that. 
(eventually they broke up with their second partner, not the one mentioned in the beginning), All great we communicate they are a very smart person, I kinda processed mentally very well how poliamory works, I also knew it could hurt sometimes, but didn't expect how much.
WHAT HAPPENED: 
yesterday they hung out with an old friend who had a sexting with years before, they told me it was just for a coffee. Didn't respond my messages for a long time ( i'm fine with it it's normal if they are with an other person), and texted me at night time, telling me that after the coffee they made out and was going to do more but the other person got too worried so they stopped. They also didn't expect that to happen, I felt very bad, even if we don't have nothing serious, since i was mentally prepared on ""it's just a coffee"" it felt like i got cheated on and i'm freaking out, I should not be this worried, I was ok processing the fact that they could make out with someone else, but i needed to know that it could happen. 
I don't know how to handle it without making them feel bad and without losing them. They are very traumatised in this sense by his previous over controlling relationship. I don't want to make them feel like they did something bad. 
(I also have a pretty heavy trauma from being cheated on in my previous relationship, it felt like going back at that moment)

1ogej2w,https://youtu.be/fMAc3_0zQfo?si=_E862aKpKV-Iozbm,How a 1940s Superhit Bollywood Song Traveled to Yemenite Jewish Populations  in Aden: Sam Dalrymple's Five Partitions Theory in Practice,"The featured track here consists of a Yemenite Jewish singer's rendition of the song *Ab Tere Siwa* from the blockbuster 1943 Bollywood hit *Kismet* starring Ashok Kumar and Mumtaz Shanti. The singer here proceeds to perform the Hindi lyrics for the first minute before going on to proceed sing the rest of the song in Hebrew (שיר הודי עדני). The user who posted the video has this to say about the song:

>In the mid-1940s, a film was shown in Aden called ""Kismet"" (Lucky). The song *Ab Tere Siwa* became popular not only in Aden, but also in Yemen, especially in ""Sana'a"". Shlomo Chakhiani grapples with the text while in Aden. Chakhiani did not know that the film was sung to the Indian gods: Krishna and Bhagwan. Chakhiani attached Yemeni text to the Indian song.

Now the why does this post link to the Five Partitions concept laid out by Sam Dalrymple in his work of the same name? As the book explains clearly, the political fissures of Partition were not limited to its most explosive manifestation in the large scale violence and displacement that followed the setting up of boundaries on the basis of the Radcliffe line, in fact that event was a culmination of a series of events in the run up to the fall of the British Raj that saw the Subcontinent's link to the wider Indian Ocean world stretching from the East African Swahili Coast in the west to the Indonesian islands in the east being ruptured in a manner that has not yet completely recovered. Where trade winds and prolonged cultural exchange once made the Subcontinent a key node, now stand boundaries both political and religious. Yemen especially was a key point of exchange in these networks historically as seen in phenomena along the western Indian coast such as [Monsoon Islam](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianHistory/comments/1jyayup/how_a_wooden_throne_from_a_portuguese_ship_ended/?ref=share&ref_source=link) and the [longstanding presence of Indian merchant diaspora communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianHistory/comments/1kxfyvf/somethings_brewing_from_yemen_how_coffee_became/?ref=share&ref_source=link) of various faiths in the Gulf. After all, it must be remembered that even the tale of the biggest Indian business tycoon of the day, Dhirubhai Ambani, began in Aden, and there's where we see Dalrymple's description of what he describes as the **Second Partition** of the Subcontinent, the first being that of Burma in 1937, with this second one severing the Gulf from the British Raj:

>A second partition – the Partition of the Arabian Peninsula from India – started the same year with the separation of Aden, and would be completed a decade later with the transfer of the Persian Gulf states in April 1947.

The Aden Colony was a key node in British trade with India with it lying near the strategic Bab al-Mandhab strait, which to this day remains highly contested as seen by the activities by Houthi rebels targetting shipping in the region. Ships from say Bombay would halt at Aden before proceeding to the Suez Canal, then Marseille and then finally London. The British realising the tremendous significance of controlling the region and its close historical trade and religious ties with the Subcontinent, decided to govern their Southern Arabian possessions directly from Bombay:

>‘India’ in 1928 began in Aden, the Victorian harbour where the Red Sea 
opened into the Indian Ocean, and the party reached it on 29 January. 
Perched in a volcanic crater between enormous fists of igneous stone, Aden was the Indian Empire’s westernmost bastion, the largest city in the Arabian  Peninsula, and like the rest of Indian Arabia it was governed as part of Bombay Province. 

Indeed these close links were not without their tensions and fissures with Indian communities in the region often occupying the position of middleman minorities, as noted by the writer Evelyn Waugh who visited Aden in the late 1920s:

>Yet venturing away from white society Waugh observed a city racked with 
division, and in a small club in the ramshackle ‘native’ part of town a group of Arabs complained to him that they were low on the racial hierarchy in the Indian Empire. The Bank of India would prefer to give loans to Europeans and mainland Indians rather than to Arabs.

Either way these tensions and practical considerations of administrative convenience resulted in the Aden colony being separated from the Raj in 1937 following the recommendations of the Simon Commission. In the meanwhile however Indian cultural influence in these regions was definitely noticeable and extended to curious cultural artifacts like this performance of a Hindi film song by a Yemenite Jewish singer who most likely fled Yemen to Israel on account of that other major Parition event around this time, that of Israel-Palestine.

I’m just enjoying a cool, breezy morning with my coffee sizzling away. There's something peaceful about the air and that first sip, sets a nice tone for the day.

Today's soundtrack is ""Better Together"" by Jack Johnson, mellow, easy-going, just what I need. 

As for the book, I’ve been diving into Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse. It’s a deep, introspective read about identity, the duality of human nature, and the quest for meaning. It's a bit heavy, but it feels fitting for a quiet morning like this.

I’m just here looking for some good conversation. I’m into books, movies, nature walks, and anything that sparks a meaningful conversation. Sometimes a morning like this makes me reflect on the little moments in life, and I’m curious if anyone else has the same feeling.

1ogeeoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ogeeoq/am_i_wrong_for_feeling_bad_about_my_biological/,Am I wrong for feeling bad about my biological dad dying?,"Hi everyone, this is my first post. I’ll start off with a bit of background info- I’m 20 years old (female), and i was adopted when i was a couple weeks old. They called up my bio older brothers adoptive mom first, since i was related to him. She took me immediately. There are so many pictures of her just staring at me while i slept. You can see the love in her eyes, with the way she looked at me. I grew up never knowing my birth parents, not that i really wanted to. I was never interested when my life was already so perfect. I was given an amazing childhood filled with love and happiness. There were some rocky parts as my order brother never really got along with my mom (adoptive). Throughout this post i will refer to my adoptive mom as my mom, since that’s what she is to me. My mom and my brother didn’t really get along- more so my brother. My mom tried her best. For context, he was about 5 years old when he was taken from my birth parents. He grew up thinking my mom stole him from his parents, and because of that he always had a deep resentment towards her. He has a lot of mental problems. I remember meeting my biological mom once when i was little, it was my brothers birthday and we went to meet her somewhere. I don’t remember much about the visit itself, but she claimed to have forgotten the gifts for my brother at her work. My mom told her we could go get them if she wanted, and she said we could get them next time she worked. When that time came around and we showed up for the gifts, she seemed surprised we came. She had given my mom a look and that’s when my mom realized that there never were any gifts. She took my brother and we left. That’s the only story i have of my birth mom, but when i was older my mom told me that my birth mom was on meth while she was pregnant with me. In fact when i was born the doctors had to do testing on me to see if i had any withdrawal symptoms. My biological mom had 8 kids in total and was either doing drugs or was drunk for all 8 of them. We all have mental issues because of this and my older sister has autism which i think is because of the drugs? Correct me if any of this sounds weird or is just not correct. All this really just shows you the kind of person she is. Moving on to my bio dad, when we were younger we would do these visits with all the biological siblings and cousins. At one of these visits, it was in the park and my biological dad thought it would be a good time to ask his drug dealer to meet him there so he could yk- illegally buy drugs. My mom took me and my brother’s home immediately. When i was 18 my biological grandma died, and i actually liked her because every time she saw us, she always tried to include us. She never left us out unlike my uncles. Although i never really had a relationship with her, i still felt like i wanted to go to her funeral since she had been good to us. When we arrived to the funeral, my bio dad came walking up to us and gave me and my brother a hug. He said it was nice to see us and that he was happy we came. I didn’t really say much i just nodded and smiled. I had gone my whole life not knowing him so i didn’t know what to say. He had added me on facebook from three different accounts, on in which he linked his favorite corn to watch. So that’s lovely and gross. otherwise the funeral was great, you could tell she was a very resilient woman and had lived a long and fulfilling life. It was fun to learn about her. At the very end when we were leaving, my dad came up to us and he said “I love you, be good,” he hugged both of us individually and i never saw him again after that. 

Moving on to the issue that has been sort of weighing on me. So a month ago my brother told me that my dad had been found dead in my cousins apartment, likely from an overdose. Drugs was the main reason my bio mom and dad weren’t allowed to take care of kids. Everytime she gave birth the child was always taken from her. So this is just another one of those times that someone died how they lived. And frankly when i first heard the news i didn’t know how to feel. 

I didn’t cry but i didn’t smile either. I never really knew him but i still felt guilty. I stared at those friend requests and i felt heavy. All my life he never reached out to me, even when i turned 18. Not for anything. He was basically a stranger, my life won’t change now that he’s gone. And you know growing up, i had always wondered what he was like. In high school i had a plan to reach out to both of them to maybe meet or talk. But as the years went on i never did. Even at my grandmas funeral, i still didn’t know what to say. I always thought that someday, I’ll talk to him and maybe get coffee? But now that’s not an option, he is just gone. 
My brother was more affected by it than i was, and when he told me i guess he didn’t like my reaction. Again i didn’t really know what to feel. I went to check on my brother and when i knocked he was on the phone with my older sister (biological). He told her sarcastically and very exaggerated, that when i heard the news i fell into my knees and cried. After he said that i just left and went to my room. 
I remember staring at the facebook requests from him and i remember thinking all about the what ifs. What if the friend requests on facebook was his way of reaching out? what if all i had to do was add him and than the door would be opened and he would’ve contacted me. 
I confided with my bf about how i was feeling and he said that it was strange i felt anything because i never knew him. He told me that even if i did have a relationship with him than would it really have been a good one? Given his history with jail and doing drugs. He thinks i made up a happy picture in my head and that i probably would have been disappointed in the end. But i thought that i would have the chance to find out, and now it’s all just “what if”. 

so reddit, am i wrong for feeling bad about my biological dad dying? Even tho i never knew him? Please let me know, i cant talk about this with my brother because of our different experiences with our dad.",1,1761463545.0,family,1,1.0,False

1oge9r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawStudentsPH/comments/1oge9r7/law_school_personality/,law school personality,"I have this friend on Facebook who seems to have made law school their entire personality. Every single post is somehow related to law school. It can be something as small as drinking coffee, but the caption will mention how it is “fuel for studying for recits.” Or they will post a random picture of their desk with thick books and highlight how “the grind never stops.” Even their stories are full of updates about their achievements in exams.

At first, I found it amusing. I understood that law school can really take over your life and that it is something to be proud of. But after a while, it honestly became so draining to see. It felt like every scroll through my feed turned into a law school diary. Eventually, I just decided to block them. I know that is always an option, and I do not hold anything against them. No hate here, whatsoever.

Still, it made me think. Why do some law students make law school their entire personality? Is it because they are proud of what they are achieving, or does it reflect how overwhelming and consuming the experience can be? Mayber it is their way of coping with the stress, or maybe they outright just want to brag? 

I am curious what others think about this. Have you also noticed people who let law school or their profession completely define who they are? Do you find it inspiring, annoying, or just part of the journey?",7,1761463012.0,LawStudentsPH,11,0.82,False

Specifically for ""NF Feeler"" Types

# 1. Notice when you're doing their character development for them

**The 3-Question Test (ask yourself before helping):**

* ""Will doing this FOR them prevent them from learning to do it themselves?""
* ""Am I more invested in their growth/success than they are?""
* ""Have I helped with this same issue 3+ times already?""

**Action steps:**

* Keep a simple note on your phone: track repeat requests from the same person
* When someone asks for help, pause and ask them: ""What have you tried so far?""
* If they haven't tried anything, that's your answer—they're outsourcing effort to you
* Practice saying: ""I believe you can handle this. Let me know how it goes.""

**Red flag phrases that mean you're doing their work:**

* ""Just this once"" (it's never once)
* ""You're so much better at this"" (translation: I don't want to learn)
* ""I don't know where to start"" (they haven't tried Googling for 30 seconds)

# 2. Track actual reciprocity over time, not intentions or words

**Create a simple reciprocity tracker:**

* Monthly check-in: On your phone or journal, list the people you regularly help
* Note: What did I do for them? What did they do for me?
* Look for 3-month patterns, not individual incidents

**Example format:**

    Person A:
    - I gave:
    - Covered their shift twice, Date time
    -edited their report, Date time 
    -listened to relationship problems (3 hours) Date time
    
    - They gave: Bought me coffee once Date time
    
    - Ratio: Severely imbalanced
    
    Person B:
    - I gave: Advice on job interview Date Time
    - They gave: 
    Helped me move, Date time
    sent me a resource I needed, Date time
    checked in when I was sick Date time
    - Ratio: Balanced and mutual

  


**The 80/20 rule:**

If you're giving 80% and receiving 20% consistently over 3 months, 

that's not a relationship—it's a service contract you didn't agree to.

  


**Watch for ""intention debt"":**

* ""I'll totally help you next time!"" (but next time never comes)
* ""I owe you one!"" (the debt is never paid)
* Actions > Words, always

# 3. Boundaries aren't mean; they're requirements for sustainable relationships

**Reframe boundaries in your mind:**

* OLD THOUGHT: ""Setting boundaries is selfish""
* NEW THOUGHT: ""Boundaries prevent resentment, which protects the relationship""

**Boundary scripts you can use today:**

*For time boundaries:*

* ""I have 15 minutes to chat, then I need to get back to work""
* ""I can help you Thursday afternoon, but not today""
* ""I'm not available for last-minute requests anymore""

*For task boundaries:*

* ""I can point you to resources, but I can't do it for you""
* ""I'm happy to review your work, but not create it""
* ""I've helped with this before—you've got this now""

*For emotional boundaries:*

* ""I care about you, but I'm not able to be your only support system""
* ""I need to step back from this conversation—it's draining me""

**The discomfort is temporary:**

* Week 1-2: Feels terrible, they may push back
* Week 3-4: They adjust or reveal who they really are
* Month 2+: You have more energy and healthier relationships

# 4. Recognize exploitation patterns

**Pattern detection checklist:**

Run this mental checklist when someone asks for help:

□ **Timing**: Is this urgent only because of their poor planning? 

□ **Frequency**: Have they asked me for similar things repeatedly? 

□ **Alternatives**: Are there other people/resources they could use but chose not to? 

□ **Effort gap**: Will this take me significantly more effort than it would save them? 

□ **Reciprocity history**: Have they ever helped me when I needed it? 

□ **Emotional manipulation**: Do I feel guilty, obligated, or trapped rather than happy to help? 

□ **Pattern with others**: Do they do this to other people too?

  


**If you checked 3+ boxes: It's exploitation, not genuine need.**

**Create a ""usual suspects"" list:**

* Mentally note who always has ""emergencies""
* Notice who only contacts you when they need something
* Watch who disappears after you help them

# 5. ""I trust you can figure this out"" is a complete sentence

**Practice these response templates:**

*When they ask you to do something they can do:*

* ""I trust you can figure this out""
* ""You're capable of handling this""
* ""I know you can work through this""

*When they push back:*

* Them: ""But I really don't know how!""
* You: ""That's what Google is for. You've got this.""

*When they try guilt:*

* Them: ""I thought you were my friend...""
* You: ""I am your friend, which is why I believe in your ability to handle this""

*When they escalate:*

* Them: ""Fine, I guess I'll just fail then!""
* You: ""I don't think you will, but that's your choice to make""

**The power of silence:**

* After you set a boundary, stop talking
* Don't justify, argue, defend, or explain (JADE)
* Their discomfort is not your emergency

**Script practice exercise:** 

Write down the top 3 requests you typically say yes to but resent. 

Write out your new boundary response for each.

 Practice saying them out loud until they feel natural.

# The Hardest Truth Implementation

**Weekly self-audit (every Sunday, 10 minutes):**

Ask yourself:

1. Who did I say ""yes"" to this week when I wanted to say ""no""?
2. What did I teach them by saying yes?
3. What will I say differently next time?

**The ""not my circus, not my monkeys"" mantra:** 

When you feel the urge to fix someone else's self-created problem,

 physically picture yourself stepping back and repeat:

 ""Not my circus, not my monkeys.""

**Celebrate small wins:** 

Every time you set a boundary,

 even if it feels awkward, acknowledge it. ""I did the hard thing today.""

**Find your ""why"":** 

Write down what you're sacrificing by always saying yes:

* Your time?
* Your projects?
* Your Areas of Responsibilities?
* Your energy?
* Your self-respect?

Post it where you'll see it when someone asks for help.

  


**Start with ONE thing this week:** Don't try to implement everything at once.

 Pick one person who consistently exploits you and use one boundary script. 

Build from there.

The goal isn't to become cold or unhelpful—

it's to help people who genuinely need it while protecting yourself from those who just find you convenient.",1,1761462987.0,INFJ1w9,0,1.0,False

***

**Stiff Joints Got You Down? 😫: Unlock Your Mobility in Just 15 Minutes (No Gym Required!)**

Hey fellow RetirementReady folks!

Ever wake up and feel like you're auditioning for a rusty tin man in the Wizard of Oz? I know I have! Seriously, those first few steps in the morning can be a *struggle* when your joints are feeling less than cooperative.

It's easy to think, ""Well, this is just part of getting older,"" and resign yourself to a life of limited movement. But what if I told you it doesn’t HAVE to be that way? What if you could reclaim some of that youthful spring in your step, even if you haven't seen the inside of a gym in, well, *years*?

That’s why I want to share something that’s been helping me immensely. It’s all about simple, quick mobility exercises you can do right at home. Think 15 minutes, tops. No fancy equipment, no pressure to keep up with a bunch of 20-year-olds doing burpees. Just you, your body, and a little bit of self-care.

Here's the gist:

*   **Morning Stretches:** Start your day with gentle stretches. Think cat-cow pose, shoulder rolls, and maybe some gentle hamstring stretches while you're still in bed! Seriously, who *doesn't* love a good stretch in bed?
*   **Chair Yoga is Your Friend:** YouTube is LOADED with chair yoga routines. They’re amazing for improving flexibility and range of motion. Plus, you can do them while sipping your morning coffee! Talk about multitasking!
*   **Walk it Out:** Even a short, brisk walk can do wonders. Get those joints moving and the blood flowing.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** This is HUGE. Don't push yourself too hard, especially at first. It's about gentle progress, not breaking any records. Remember those days? Me neither.

I get it. Life happens. Maybe you've been focusing on other things. Maybe your joints are currently singing the blues louder than B.B. King. But, it’s *never* too late to start feeling better.

And if you're thinking, ""Okay, sounds good, but where do I even BEGIN?"" I have something that might help! I found this fantastic freebie guide with some awesome stretches and exercises. **We believe in strongest people**, and this will give you some easy steps to get going: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)

What are your go-to strategies for keeping your joints feeling happy and healthy? I'm always looking for new ideas. Do you have that *one* stretch that always makes a difference? Maybe a funny story about the time you tried to be too ambitious with your flexibility? Let's hear 'em!

I was up early, enjoying a fresh cup of coffee. My wife was asleep upstairs after working a long night shift. It was her day off, so I decided to work from home and let her rest. Not wanting to wake her, I brought my gear downstairs to the basement to set up for my podcast, The Afterthought Lounge.

While prepping, I skimmed through yesterday’s audio logs. That’s when I saw it—an unfamiliar voice memo.

Only two minutes long.

Timestamp? 2:30 AM.
I didn’t remember recording anything at that time. My last saved file ended around 9:30 PM.

Curious, I threw on my headphones and hit play.

Nothing.

Just a full minute of silence.

I figured it was an accidental recording—maybe background noise or mic interference—but something about it itched at the back of my skull. A weird pressure. I hit play again.

That’s when I heard the voice.

My voice.

Faint, glitching under heavy static. I ran it through my editing software—noise reduction, volume boost—and replayed it.

What I heard chilled me:

⸻

“Listen to me. The life you’re living isn’t real.
You don’t have a wife. You never did.
You need to wake up. Before it’s too late—”

(bitter, shaky laugh)
“She’s coming. I don’t even know why I still call it she.
That thing wearing her skin? It’s watching. Learning.
It doesn’t bleed. It doesn’t blink.
But it knows your habits. Your tells. Your guilt.”

(gunshots. a scream. something slams hard—like bone hitting concrete.)

“It lets you feel safe long enough to forget.
You’ve done this before. Don’t you feel it?
The patterns? The same words. The same coffee. The same lie?”

(panic rising)
“You think this is the first time we’ve had this conversation?”
“You don’t remember because it wants you to forget.
It feeds off the forgetting.”

(deeper static. heavy breathing.)

“Whatever you do—don’t go upstairs when it calls your name.
Don’t look at it. Don’t answer. Don’t believe its face.
It’s not real.”

(sobbing now—shaky, desperate)
“Please… just get out. You can still escape.
Don’t let it touch you. Don’t let it speak your name—
It doesn’t kill you.
It keeps you.”

(wet gurgling. dragging sounds. one final voice—yours—screaming through tears:)
“I think I loved it once. Or maybe… it loved wearing her.”

(A sharp snap. Metal bending. Something wet drags away.)

(Then: silence. Sticky. Heavy. As if blood soaked the tape itself.)

⸻

I ripped the headphones off. My heart was pounding. Was it a prank? Some messed-up audio experiment I forgot I ran?

And then—
I heard my name.
From upstairs.

Soft. Familiar. Too familiar.

“Hey…? Where’d you go?”

Then again—closer.

“Babe?”

I stood frozen. My blood felt wrong in my veins.
If that wasn’t my wife… then what the hell was it?

I turned toward the basement window. My hands fumbled with the lock. I had to get out. I was about to open it when—

“There you are, silly. I was wondering where you were.”

She stood at the top of the stairs, smiling sweetly. But her voice—it had no weight. Like it was mimicking something human.

She walked down slowly.

“What are you doing by the window?”

I forced a calm smile.

“Just… getting some air.”

I turned back to the glass.

And that’s when I saw it.

Her reflection.

It wasn’t human.

Distorted. Twisted. A grotesque mockery of her face—like it was learning what people should look like and almost got it right.

Then I felt it.

A hand gripped mine. Cold. Wrong.

“Let’s not do that, okay?”
Her voice was right behind me.

And then—

Everything went dark.

⸻

I woke up this morning.

Coffee. Birds. Quiet.

She’s still asleep upstairs.

And I’m just here, sipping coffee like nothing ever happened.

But something did happen.

I checked my laptop. The voice memo is gone.

But I swear…

I hear faint static in my headphones.

And sometimes, just barely—

I think I hear myself calling.

Regrettably, I must let every glittering fragment of our connection fall away for its triggers are much too strong and they usher me back into darkness. I do not desire any form of clarity, reassurance, contact or even validation-that is my fear imbued belief systems. I am connected to you through fear and unspoken truth; all that is light is overshadowed by the heavier elements of this journey and this cannot continue. I am so very sorry for any pain, hurt, confusion or hindrance. I hope that you can forgive me. I pray that you are surrounded by softness, understanding, compassion and pleasure. Thank you for being my catalyst. Thank you for giving me a second chance to live❤️ Life can be beautiful. May sobering sensations nurse our mistrusting wounds and remind us of our purpose in this world. Bye bye 👋 ❤️ Loved you like cheese and red wine 🍷 I must grow on my own, finally feel the grounding autumn breeze direct me towards intentional purpose. I cannot continue to resist what will be. I am absolutely terrified of what is yet to transpire for I am absolutely appalled by my own faithlessness and insolent mind-the convalescent consequences will be accepted. You are always safe, welcome and free to greet me in any way that you wish but I must learn how to separate myself from this cycle. I am so sorry. I trust the smile that your spirit blesses me with. I trust the softening touch of your healing hands, but it is so early for me and I feel the weight of possibility every hour. Truthfully, I do not feel safe enough to trust. I do not believe that you wish me well. I do not believe that you will show me mercy. I do not know if I deserve it. I tried my best ❤️🫶🏻 You are always safe Xx  Sidenote: Everyone should listen to this band-The Red clay Strays! Listen to sleeping at last too-they are so beautiful.

Most days, I’m somewhere between a caffeine high and a financial model. My mornings start before sunrise — gym, black coffee, and questionable life choices — and my nights end with either a good podcast or me trying to convince myself that scrolling LinkedIn counts as self-improvement.

I’ll text you good morning, send a meme five minutes later, and then act chill while secretly overanalyzing your “haha.” I’m that kind of balance — part chaos, part charm, full effort.

I can cook a mean breakfast, burn dinner impressively, and still make you laugh in between. I like people who can hold a conversation that goes from stupidly funny to strangely deep without warning.

I’m into long drives with loud music, sunsets that make you forget your phone exists, and spontaneous plans that somehow end up being the best nights.

If you’re someone who values ambition but still knows how to enjoy the little things — like coffee at 2 AM or laughing until it hurts — we’ll probably vibe.

I like my coffee strong, my playlists unpredictable, and my chemistry effortless.

Swipe right if you can handle sarcasm, late-night conversations, and the occasional existential crisis about brunch plans.

Coffee’s on me — just promise you won’t ghost me like my abs did. ☕👻

P.S. If we match, I’ll probably ask you what your toxic trait is… mine’s saying “one last episode” every night and pretending I’m mysterious when I’m really just sleep-deprived.

So this happened a couple of days ago, and I’m still cringing so hard that I might fold into another dimension.

At work, we have this little ritual where we all join a “coffee chat” Zoom on Fridays — basically just talking nonsense for 15 minutes before actually doing our jobs. Usually, it’s stuff like “what’s your favorite pizza topping” or “what show are you watching lately.”

This week’s question was: *“What’s a random childhood memory that still makes you laugh?”*

Everyone went around saying normal, funny things like “I once ate dog food” or “my brother convinced me the moon was following us.”  
When it was my turn, my brain went completely blank… and for some reason, I blurted out a story that was *way too dark* for a coffee chat.

I said, *“Oh yeah, one time when I was 10, I tried to make my own fireworks with matches and a deodorant can.”*  
Everyone laughed nervously, so of course, I doubled down and said, *“It exploded. I didn’t have eyebrows for two weeks.”*

Silence. Just… silence.

Then my manager went, “Oh… wow. You’re okay though, right?”  
And I just nodded while sipping my coffee like it was no big deal, but inside my soul was disintegrating.

Now they all treat me like I’m some chaotic gremlin who might blow up the office microwave any second. I tried to joke about it later, but every time someone lights a candle, they just… look at me.

The fluorescent lights hummed to life above me, casting a sterile, gray light over my desk. I grabbed a hot cup of eternally stale tasting coffee and settled in, the clatter of my keyboard echoing in the empty space. Another early morning, another spreadsheet. My mornings were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Widgets"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. My biggest challenge of the week was usually trying to find the missing five cents from the last delivery order for a new shipment of widgets. I was a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I was content with that.

An hour later, other people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. I glanced over my cubicle wall and saw the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was usually a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted over once she saw me and went for a high five, but she completely whiffed, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. ""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, and this time our palms made a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered a reply about it being a good start to the day, and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I looked up from my monitor and glanced across the room near Brenda’s cubicle, just to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her hands clasped behind her back, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so intense. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. But it wasn't Brenda. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all of her teeth. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, were fixed on me. And then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand hitting my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut returning, and the cold, unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above me grew louder, higher, until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in a final, wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision started to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Another person, Melissa the office admin, was there too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief moment of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there, gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I...?"" she whispered, her voice small and shaky.""What...?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding seemed to wash over her. Her eyes welled up with tears. ""Oh my god... what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't...""

Melissa was trying to figure out what
had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just... shaken. As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I couldn't bring myself to be angry. The look of genuine horror and remorse on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. I knew that if I told them what had really happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything.
""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just... slipped and fell. It was an accident.""

Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, their eyes darting from the fresh marks on my throat to the wild, panicked look on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest, but I held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I insisted, the words feeling foreign and clumsy on my tongue. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident.""
Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression slowly shifting from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he didn't say anything. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was.

""I'm fine,"" I repeated one last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""

1ogdmq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ogdmq9/he_was_25_years_old/,He was 25 years old.,"I have never lost someone like this before. He took his own life. I think what's really hurting me is the fact that his mother is posting such explicit things about his death. She has every right to grieve the way she needs to. I just never expected to read these things in great detail. 

I'm doing a lot of hopeful thinking. I hope it was just a mistake. I hope it wasn't intentional. I hope he wasn't suffering so badly that he did what he did. I hope he didn't feel anything. I hope he knew how loved he was. 

I'm also incredibly angry at him. He was supposed to grow old with a cute wife and have super tall children that look exactly like him. He wasn't supposed to die outside alone as the rain poured on him. I'm supposed to reach out and buy him coffee as he tells me about the new life that he built after we said goodbye to each other when we graduated high school many years ago. 

I'm supposed to reach out. 

I didn't reach out. 

I don't know how to process any of this. 

I just feel so sick.

1ogdm00,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1ogdm00/october_and_midlife_crisis/,October and midlife crisis,"It's that time of the year. October. 
The month Prince of Wales, became the first nobleman in Britain to be hung. Women got right to oxford membership. UN came into existence. Indra Gandhi was assassinated by two matyrs.

But october is more than that. It's the month
Dehradun has its winter line showing in the sky. The air starts smelling poetry. Regret for the year lost is mixed with nostalgia of the time won. 

The evenings are the most October. A feeling somewhere before the end. 
Mom is listening to gurbani while I make my filter coffee. Another shot at perfecting the milk to coffee ratio. 
The background noise of children in the street bursting crackers mixed with slack notifications sound. 

But october isn't about the midlife crisis. It's about being grateful. Grateful of a world where October exists. 
Imagine going directly from September to November. 

October starts with me being the youngest I have ever been, and ends with the oldest I will be this year.
The month which is a pathway for realisations. Becoming aware that JEE is not for me. Accepting that I have lost her. Comprehending that it's too late to reply to all the unread messages of my friends. Cognizance of my life, and another year of high hopes and unreachable dreams. 

True realisations often end with what if. 
What if it happens. What if I fly, I am falling anyways. The month of Chances. Possibilities. Probabilities. Questioning the odds and betting on yourself. A fight with destiny, Twisting of fate. 

October ends with acceptance. Not sure if in a spiritual way. But in my own way. 
It's a month that gives a reminder, you only have one life.

1ogdl5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ogdl5u/sharing_my_story_to_help_me_move_on_from_my_crush/,Sharing my story to help me move on from my crush,"TL;DR: I met a guy who was in my city for two weeks. We had feelings for each other, but we have not spoken in two months. I am struggling to accept that this all meant nothing to him. I am working on focusing on myself and trying to let him go.

I do not expect anyone to read all of this; this is solely for me to get this out of my head so I can hopefully begin to move on. I realize now that none of this truly meant anything.

I moved to a new city in September of 2024. I spent the last few months of 2024 and the first few months of 2025 dating. I did date one man for two months total, but no actual relationships with labels came from this time period. At one point, I believe in March of 2025, I went on a string of terrible first dates that caused me to delete the dating apps altogether.

After deleting the apps, I met someone in real life who asked me on a date. I was excited for this date, but there wasn't a romantic connection. I was super disappointed that there wasn't a romantic connection with this person. After this date, I went into a bit of a spiral for two weeks afterwards. I remember at one point, I was crying and just so angry with God for my current situation. I didn't know why I was brought to this city or what I was doing.

Then, two weeks after this spiral episode, I met Beck.

Beck was part of a group of students who temporarily came to my city as part of a school event, and the group stayed in my house for two weeks. I met Beck in my house. From the moment we met, we instantly hit it off; there was some sort of connection between us. I remember I woke up one morning and got ready for work. I went into the kitchen to microwave some food, and Beck was standing in the kitchen with a few other people. He introduced himself, I introduced myself, and we just got to chatting. Through this short conversation, we found out that we both did similar jobs in the past. After this short conversation, I knew there was some sort of connection between us. From then on, for the rest of the two weeks the group was in town, I did my best to try and see Beck as much as possible.

I remember one day I went into the kitchen to fill up my water bottle, and there was a group of the students (including Beck) sitting at the kitchen table eating lunch. As soon as I walked into the kitchen, Beck noticed me walk in and shouted out to me: ""There's food on the stove, please eat if you're hungry!"" I decided to sit at the table with the others and eat with them. While I was sitting and eating, Beck was telling a story. While he was talking, he was very deliberately making eye contact with me while he was talking. This was when I realized that he might have feelings for me.

Anytime he saw me walk into the house, Beck would look at me and immediately say something to me, whether it was him giving me an update that a group of the students was sick, to him letting me know that my laundry was finished washing. It felt like he was always keeping an eye out for me. I remember another time when I was walking around the house with my roommate to look for something, and I could feel him sort of keeping an eye on me while he was in a conversation.

There was also one afternoon when Beck, my roommate, and I had a conversation for a few hours. We sat at the kitchen table and got to know each other a little better. It felt like he was asking me questions and really trying to get to know me better.

There was also one evening when I went into the kitchen to fill up my water bottle. I was chatting with a few people in the kitchen. Beck was in the dining room and walked over to the kitchen island to join the conversation. I remember I set my water bottle on the counter and was putting the lid on it, when I looked up and saw Beck staring at me. I got shy and immediately looked back down. I also remember another instance when he came and knocked on my roommate and I's door. He opened the door, I immediately looked at him and smiled, and he made eye contact with me and smiled back.

There was one day when I came home from work and walked in the front door of the house. Beck was sitting on the couch, and when he saw me come in, he immediately sat up and asked me how my day was. I admittedly was not in a good mood this day, but I sat through dinner and watched a movie with the group. There was a point at dinner when we were all talking and Beck and I said the exact same thing at the exact same time. At one point, I was drinking tea out of a cup and left it at my spot at the kitchen table while I did dishes. After I finished the dishes, I walked back to the table and couldn't find my cup. I thought I must have taken it to the kitchen with me, but I hadn't. I spent a second looking for it, but I gave up and went to the living room with the others for the movie. When I went to sit down on one of the couches, I saw my cup on the coffee table and immediately realized that Beck had moved my cup for me. Even when I wasn't in a good mood, he took the time to care for me a little bit.

The night before the group left the city, my roommate and I got back a little late from an event in town. I walked into the house and immediately started to take the trash out. Beck was sitting at the kitchen table and saw me doing this. He got up and wanted to help me. He took out part of the trash (without me asking), and I took out the other part. After this, I asked Beck if he would be awake for a while longer - and he said yes. I went and changed into comfier clothes, and Beck, my roommate (for an hour or so), and I spent the evening working on a puzzle and talking. At one point, it was just Beck and me. Him and I talked that night for probably at least four hours. It was a good opportunity for us to get to know each other a little better. At one point, unprompted, he mentioned to me wanting to pursue dating after he finishes school. When we finished that night, we hugged, and he mentioned wanting to exchange phone numbers before the group left. After this night, I knew I had romantic feelings for him. After my talk with Beck, I couldn't sleep. I wrote Beck a note stating that I was shocked by how much we had in common and basically telling him that I liked him. I gave him the note the next day as I was saying goodbye to him and hugged him again.

Beck texted me the day after I gave him the note, saying that he felt ""the exact same way."" Beck and I began texting every few days with updates on our lives, little get-to-know-you questions, and occasional voice memos. This was a pattern for about two months.

Then, by the end of June, I didn't hear from Beck for two weeks. He came back and messaged me as if nothing had happened - and I did not have the courage to bring the silence up and how it hurt me. From here, it was I who started the conversations. I realized at one point that I had started the conversations with him three times in a row. He was responding and engaging with me, but he wasn't starting conversations with me. At this point, I worried that I was bothering him. I know he would respond to me if I texted him, but I don't want to annoy him. So, at the end of July, I decided not to start another conversation with him and to leave that to him.

As a result, I have not spoken to Beck for almost two months.

This hurts me. I realize now that, while he gave me a fun two weeks, he was either lying when he told me he felt the same way I did, or something changed with his feelings (i.e., he met someone else), and he has not communicated this to me.

I did have feelings for Beck, and it hurts that they are no longer reciprocated. I need time to process more, but this kills me. I really felt this would go somewhere. Sometimes my brain will have a thought that maybe he will reach out, but I need to be better about being realistic - that there is nothing here anymore. I need to move on.

I will do my best to focus on myself and what I can control in all this. I have a lot of things I can be working on in my life. I want to get to a place where I can let this experience go and just break free.

I was always told ""no man will love you if you're fat"" ever since I was 8. Because of this, every time a guy I was interested in actually confessed to me, I always reeled away and ghosted him. I'm just so scared of entering a relationship and being vulnerable. Like I feel so uncomfortable getting up close to anyone let alone with a guy I like. Even my friends of 10+ years have never been in my room because I'm scared they'll see how filthy it is. I never talk about my parents to anyone because they'll think I'll become exactly the same as these toxic immature, obnoxious, narcissists because I'm their offspring. So if I ever get in a relationship and am forced to show these vulnerabilities to my lover, I just know he'll be repulsed by every part of me. My double chin, back acne, crooked toes, immature humor, messy room, crazy parents, lazy brothers, etc. Yet at the same time I yearn so much for love and affection. I really want so badly to have a boyfriend that loves me for all my flaws.

About 3 months ago, I was introduced to this friend of a friend. It was a platonic meetup at a mutual's birthday party. I felt like we really hit it off. He's such a good guy. He's currently pursuing a master's degree, he is so emotionally intelligent, he's constantly bettering himself whether it's gyming or learning a new skill, he's the golden son that takes care of his single mother. So obviously I fell for him hard, and I could tell he also had mutual feelings for me. Yesterday he texted me to meet up for coffee today, and I just know that he'll be asking me out. I am so conflicted right now because my heart wants to be his girlfriend. Yet my brain keeps telling me that this will never work out. Once he sees me for who I am—a fat ugly loser that has nothing going on in her life—he'll quickly regret asking me out.",0,1761459909.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

I (20f) and my fiancé (21m) are coming up on our 3 years of being together, our anniversary being Nov. 7th. We wanted to do something bigger this year and decided we'd splurge on a trip down to Gatlinburg, TN. We live in MKE and plan to drive down there (a 10+ hour trip 🥲).

I looked at a lot of different hotels/inns in the area and my Fiancé and I decided we'd stay at ""The Appy Lodge"". This was one of the most promising spots based off of stars/reviews and location. We got a King Suite with a Mountainside view, hoping that doesn't disappoint.

We are making the drive on Thursday (Nov. 6th) and have our plans mapped out for Friday for our celebration. Saturday is the long drive back home. So, we really only have a whole day and the morning of our leave to be in Gatlinburg for our anniversary.
Listed Below is the roadmap for Friday:

Breakfast—
• The Pancake Pantry 🥞 

Lunch–
• No Way José's Cantina 🌮

Dinner—
• Best Italian on the Parkway 🍝

Adventures—
•Ripleys Aquarium 🪼
•Speedwerks Exotic Car Experience🏎

Other Snack Stops—
•Smokey Bear Brew🐻
•Waffle de Lys🧇
•Gatlinbrews Coffee-Boba-Energy🧋

Traditionally, we've sold our sun-dried coffee cherries to traders. However, we've recognized that the real value lies further down the chain—in roasting, grinding, and connecting directly with customers.

My cousins and I are planning to start a side hustle to roast, package, and sell our own coffee online. Since this community is full of passionate coffee enthusiasts, we’d love your input to help guide our strategy.

We're particularly interested in reaching a discerning audience and showcasing the quality of specialty robusta, which we feel is often overlooked. Any feedback on what you look for when buying packaged coffee online or in-store would be incredibly helpful.

Here are some questions we have for you:

* How can a new, small-scale brand gain your trust and stand out in a crowded online market?
* Do you prefer to buy whole beans or ground coffee?
* What is your perception of 100% robusta coffee, and would you be interested in trying a specialty-grade version?
* Are you more interested in a pure robusta or a robusta/arabica blend?
* What roast profiles do you prefer (light, medium, dark)? Are there certain profiles you would be particularly interested in for a robusta?
* How important are labels like ""organic"" and ""single-origin"" (from a specific farm or region) to your purchasing decision?
* What are your thoughts on flavored coffees (e.g., hazelnut, chocolate)? Is there a market for a high-quality, flavored robusta?
* What kind of information would you like to see on the coffee bag or our website? (e.g., processing method, altitude, tasting notes)
* When you try a new coffee, what brewing methods do you typically use? Are there any specific recommendations for a high-quality robusta?",1,1761459758.0,IndiaCoffee,5,1.0,False
