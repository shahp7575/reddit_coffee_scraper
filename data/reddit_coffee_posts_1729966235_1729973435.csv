I'm ""in charge"" of 7 different stations Monday and Tuesday 5 the rest of week when my coworkers are scheduled early to help. I'm a hard worker. I only take my scheduled 30 minute break I never take my 10 minute break or stand around and chit chat with coworkers. I have limited my water/coffee intake so I can get things done in time. My higher ups, coworkers, and customers are wonderful and so nice.

I'm constantly busy and running around. Management and higher ups are constantly praising me for what a great job I'm doing. But I feel like I'm doing the work of two people and I can't keep up mentally or physically and im not doing a good job. My manager had to remind me of things that i forgot and i feel bad that they have to pick up behind me/stay after me. They obviously can't higher someone just for a few hours those two days.

1gcto0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1gcto0g/different_sda_cultures/,Different SDA Cultures,"So I grew up in the Caribbean and have since visited multiple SDA churches on multiple Caribbean Islands and on multiple areas in the US. I would say, with some exceptions, most Caribbean churches (on the Islands) are conservative lifestyle wise, but generally not in relation to American politics. That being said, sometimes elements of cultural syncretism take place, and you may have Calypso versions of hymns played in churches; or SDA members having no problem with going out to cultural festivals (eg. Independence Day celebrations with cultural music).

With regards to America, what I have noticed is, discounting organizationally progressive churches like SDA Kinship, etc; on average, ""mainstream"" University Churches tend to be the most progressive ""orthodox"" SDA churches I have visited.

In particular, current Oakwood's University Church has had a pretty ""lit"" Sabbath Service (drums, etc); and Pastor Snell, while he definitely still preaches biblical fundamentalist ideas in the few times I've heard him, he hasn't so far really preach straight up lunacy (e.g. ""Why you shouldn't go to the movies"" or the need of 'Health Reform' in abstaining from meat or coffee, or things like that).

Outside of that, certain black American churches I have visited tend to not be remotely as conservative as white churches like the Village SDA Church in Berrien Springs.

Has anyone here visited both SDA churches from different racial or other cultural backgrounds? What have been your experiences with regards to the culture of those different churches?

Tunisians of reddit: Say Public University/High school (The free one) didn't work out for you  
Would you rather:  
  
1 - Work a menial job: Waitress / Sanitation Worker(ÿπÿßŸÖŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÅÿ©).  
2 - Do a formation in something ( BTS / BTP) or work as a bus / taxi driver.  
3 - Private University if affordable, I don't know anybody who failed private university (unless they didn't pay)  
4 - Do Nothing cause broke and have Ego.

I want to know your opinions on this BUT especially women's opinions between option 1/4.

I ask this because I've been traveling around European countries for the previous 2 years,  and I've seen girls working in many different jobs that I've never seen women do in  Tunisia (or it's too rare).  
  
Small example, when I get into a bus/metro in Europe you have a 30% chance to have a woman driver, in Tunisia it's 1% (I actually never seen one but I said 1 because they surely exist).  
When I get into a coffee shop / Bar in Europe it's 50% to be a women waitress, in Tunisia it's 15%.

Also men, would you be okay with your wife/daughter/sister doing these jobs ?   
  
I ask this because in my family, I have some female cousins who actually chose to stay unemployed rather than working a menial job (they failed high school/university -> did a formation/ Private University-> didn't find a job -> Unemployed for years)

So is it only my extended family (that I already know is toxic and have crazy ego) or is this common in Tunisian families ?

So this morning I got up to make coffee and breakfast.

And i should be greatful she hasn't cheated on me yet. So I shut up like I always do.

Because if anyone yells at me I just start to be quite idk why to be honest.

The dining room table splits the kitchen and living room. It‚Äôs a round, dark walnut table that seats 7. Ideally I think I would like to have wood(not sure if light or dark) and some color (just not white) on the chairs, perhaps brass or silver accents?

I have asked if my dad would give me a reasonable amount for TBI rehab that has been helping me and a neck procedure, as well as some money to get back in my feet to get back to work (apartment security deposit, furniture as I have none). He is technically considered wealthy, and makes money in perpetuity. D has refused to help in any way and emotionally abused me to a point I do not want to get into detail about.

I was thinking if he was willing, to see if he would mediate a conversation between myself and my dad. I know my dad will not come to an office so meeting at a coffee shop near his office.

She said her dad didn‚Äôt allow her to attend my wedding (her dad is really weird tbh) but she went to her other friends wedding‚Ä¶

I feel like we were only friends because we grew up together and our families know each other. But we‚Äôre actually very different and there are many things about her personality which irritate me. 

She comes from a weird family, her dad is super strict and never really allowed her to have any freedom. I always felt sorry for her. 
Her dad has gone away for a few months and whenever he goes away she wants to go out and make the most of her time.
I feel like she uses me in a way, and tbh I go out with her because I feel bad for her.

Whenever we go out for example, to the cinema, or to eat, I‚Äôve noticed I always end up paying.
She‚Äôs working full time, there‚Äôs no reason why she shouldn‚Äôt offer to pay. 
Another annoying thing is that when we go shopping I like to sit in a cafe and get a coffee.
I always ask her if she wants anything and she says no. So I bought myself a coffee and a cake. Then she started saying ‚Äúoh that cake looks nice‚Äù and I felt awkward eating in front of her so I offered some to her and she ate it and shared my coffee. 
I don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ she has money. She buys herself clothes when we go shopping but she‚Äôll never offer to pay for anything when we‚Äôre getting food or coffee.

Today we went to the cinema and guess who ended up paying for the cinema tickets.. me. 
I was waiting for her to offer but of course she didn‚Äôt.
I asked if she wants any popcorn or nachos and she said no. Who goes to the cinema without buying popcorn or a drink.. 
I bought myself some nachos and she ended up sharing them with me. 

There are also many other things that have been getting on my nerves. She acts like a know it all, I always listen to her rant but whenever I talk she hardly listens. 
I give her advice and she never takes it. 
She‚Äôs always been very possessive about stupid things, for example, if she likes a series or a celebrity she gets annoyed when other people also like them. It‚Äôs so weird. 

She assumes things about me, for example, I‚Äôm the one who asked if she wanted to go watch a movie and then she assumed that I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to go. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it..

Aside from me being nervous during the first draw (there were 4 total) it wasn‚Äôt bad. My husband came with me and in between draws, we did our best to fill in the time. After the first draw and finishing the drink, we walked to a coffee shop so at least one of us could enjoy some caffeine. We then walked around the block a few times until the second draw. After that, we drove over to our local fire station where they were holding an event to teach parents how to safely install car seats. We got back to the lab right on time. After number 3, we walked to the labor and delivery floor to pre-register and ask about hospital tours. Then walked around the block again for a good 20 minutes before going in for the last draw. Afterwards we rewarded ourselves with a late breakfast. Husband fasted with me all morning in solidarity. Ha! I love him. Anyway, my advice is that, if possible, just try and occupy your time in between getting your blood drawn. It made the process go by so much faster. And if you‚Äôre nervous about needles, so am I.

She is stealth, so I can never really tell the full story of our relationship when people ask about it. I hope you'll indulge me to let me briefly share it here. 

Puppygirl and I technically met when we were 5 and our parents were in the same church small group. But shortly afterwards my family left that church and started going to a different one (Southern Baptist). So I suppose we *really* met when we were 13 and were in the same band class. 

I had a crush on her pretty much as soon as I met her. She doesn't agree with me on this, but I think she was really pretty even before she transitioned (now after transitioning she's like a supermodel mixed with a Disney princess). I was *so* relieved to finally have a crush on a """"""boy"""""" because obviously being gay wasn't ok in my religious conservative family. I'd had crushes on girls before, but never on a boy, so I was starting to get worried that I was gay and broken. 

Anyways, puppygirl and I started ""dating"" in 8th grade (to the extent that two 8th graders can date‚Äîso basically just holding hands occasionally). The relationship was exactly as messy as you'd assume it would be, particularly given my mental health struggles at the time (that's a different story). We broke up at the end of summer before going to different high schools. 

Puppygirl then started dating my best friend from middle school. And after that didn't work out, she dated someone else who shared my first name (lol). I didn't date anyone. I didn't even talk to guys honestly. 

I kept waiting to have a crush on another """"""guy,"""""" but it just wasn't happening. Instead I just kept getting crushes on girls and hating myself more and more for it. There were a total of two openly gay people in my graduating class of 200, so it's not like I could have been out to anyone even if my parents *were* ok with it, which they very much were not. My dad refused to go to the wedding of his coworker (and supposedly close friend) because it was a gay wedding. My mom almost refused to let her best friend visit because she was going to bring her girlfriend with her. I got plenty of sermons on why being gay was terrible. 

Anyways, this whole time, I couldn't stop thinking about puppygirl. I hadn't spoken to her at all since the breakup, but 3 years later, I just couldn't get her out of my head. I Googled how long it takes to get over an ex and found some sort of statistic listing 2.5 years. Since I was half a year overdue, I figured I needed to do something about it. I thought that the only reason I couldn't get myself to feel interested in boys was because I was still stuck on puppygirl, not because I was a dirty homo. 

So I reached out to puppygirl on Facebook Messenger and asked if she wanted to meet up for coffee. She told me that she was watching The Bachelorette but would get back to me at the end of the episode. Then we planned a time to meet up that weekend. 

We got coffee together, and as soon as I saw her, I knew I was cooked. This meetup was *supposed* to be for me to realize that she wasn't *actually* all that and finally get over her, but instead I just fell for her even harder. 

So we started dating again. I had a scholarship to an Ivy League but decided to disappoint my parents by going to a state school instead (so that puppygirl and I could go to the same college).

Both her and I continued to be cis straight conservative Christians all throughout college. I literally taught Sunday school. We were Saving It For Marriage. It took us almost a year to even have our first kiss. 

I graduated a year early and we immediately got married. I worked at a dentist office while she finished up her degree, then we both moved to a bigger city so that I could work at a marketing agency there. 

Puppygirl never got a job. She tried a few different things to make money, but going out in public was just too difficult for her. I think the repression was really starting to get to her. She wore the exact some thing every day and hated looking in the mirror.

I could tell on some level that she was expressing her femininity vicariously through me. She loved helping me pick out clothes, which I thought was really fun. It also got a bit toxic sometimes, with her having very specific preferences for how I looked. I was already ana by this point, so this all sort of created a viscous loop. 

We loved each other very much, but neither one of us were happy. Then, one of my coworkers came out as a trans woman. By then I had a feeling that puppygirl might also be a trans woman, but I never brought it up to her because I thought it was just Satan tempting me with Evil Lesbian Thoughts. 

One night, puppygirl confessed to me that she wished she had been born a girl. This didn't come as a surprise to me at all. She didn't know if she should transition or just continue to rep, but I gently encouraged her to transition. I told her that now that she had admitted this to herself, the cat was out of the bag. She couldn't just go back to pretending to be a man. I thought doing that would probably end up killing her. 

She agreed with me and started HRT within a week. We told both of our families. Hers immediately disowned her after telling her she was going to hell. Then they sent her a few emails telling her that I had manipulated her into doing this because I was an Evil Lesbian. 

My parents' first reaction was to try to talk her out of it and tell her she was making a mistake, but they eventually came around. The first thing my dad asked me when I told him puppygirl was transitioning is ""does this mean you're a lesbian now?"" I told him I guess it did since I was married to a woman. He told me ""you know, having same-sex attraction doesn't make you gay."" I have NO idea what to make of that. Years later I explained what nonbinary was to my mom and she told me that she almost certainly would have identified as that if the concept existed when she was my age. 

Anyways, now that puppygirl was transitioning, we had to stop going to our Gay Is Sin church. She actually wanted to keep going to it, but I talked her out of it. One of my good friends who I met at work was openly nonbinary and also a Christian, so they invited us to their church. That was the first time I'd ever heard any pronouns other than he/him used to refer to God. 

It was all very overwhelming, but I coped by focusing all my energy on helping puppygirl. Transitioning is *so* much work, as most of you are already well aware. She had so many appointments to go to and so much paperwork to file and so many awkward conversations to have with friends. It was really hard for her. On top of that, her years of repressed dysphoria all came slamming down on her at once. 

There were many nights that I went to sleep not knowing if she would still be alive in the morning. I never had her committed because I also had an extensive history with suicidality and I believed (and still kind of believe) that involuntary commitment did more harm than good. So I just tried my best to make peace with the fact that I might lose her and did everything in my power to help her keep going hour-to-hour. We both cried so much that tears stopped coming out. I cried myself to sleep most nights, and I think she did too (she never came to bed until I was already asleep).

Slowly but surely, things got better. We moved from the east coast to the west coast and got an apartment we couldn't afford. Paying for laser, coolsculpting, FFS, and SRS added up quickly. At one point we had negative $5,000 in our bank account. 

I worked my ass off and was able to get a new job making almost twice as much as I had before. We lived as frugally as possible and managed to get our bank account in the positives again. Puppygirl had both her surgeries and started doing better every day. 

I still remember the first time she went out in public without me after she transitioned (a 20 minute run to the grocery store). It was so hard for her but she just kept pushing through it. It's crazy to look back on that and see how far she's come. Now she's a regular social butterfly and loves going out with her friends. She's even started applying for jobs at coffee shops!

I'm doing much better as well, mostly because I no longer go to bed every night wondering if I'll find my wife's body in the morning. My entire department got laid off 3 months ago, so being unemployed has obviously been difficult. Fortunately we have savings. Fingers crossed I'll get a new job soon. 

Having so much free time and no longer having someone else's crisis to focus on (now that puppygirl is doing so much better) has forced me to actually think about myself from time to time. I'm working on my own Gender Bullshit right now and trying to come to terms with the fact that it's time to disappoint my parents yet again. But puppygirl is helping me a lot. 

I have no idea what the next few months will bring for us‚Äîmuch less the next few years. One of my goals is to make some friends myself (inspired by puppygirl making her own friends). I'd also like to wear boyclothes in public and start lifting weights (neither of which I have any rational reason to actually be anxious about, but for some reason I am). I'm also still trying to get a handle on my sexuality and figure out what that might look like for someone in a dedicated monogamous relationship with an ace woman. Overall just a lot to work through, but all good things. 

If anyone has read this far, I applaud you. Thanks so much for listening to my ramblings. And always remember, C4T is a psyopp. ",5,1729971409.0,4tran4,2,0.73,False

I teach 9th grade. Some classes I am perfectly able to deal with classroom management. I‚Äôve given a few, one in particular, ‚Äúwake up call‚Äù talks to my students. But I have so far had a really hard time denying students a chance to go to the bathroom. I came in with zero teaching experience, and started as a teacher trainee in the spring but really given zero training. I‚Äôm a really nice and empathetic person. My male counterparts are now telling me that I am being taken advantage of by students. I do know they‚Äôre right, but the way they said it was in a way a bit extreme and sort of rude TBH (the one teacher lets his students all sit out if they want and is also know for rolling the ball out and doing coaching admin work during class‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs a bit authoritative when he wants to be‚Ä¶ and I def wasn‚Äôt asking for feedback.) 

One student was on pass restriction and I didn‚Äôt realize it because to be honest, it‚Äôs a lot to manage all of the different students, their behavior issues, accommodations, etc. not an excuse and it hasn‚Äôt happened other times students were on pass restriction, so this was a first time mistake.  I‚Äôm having a hard time juggling it all and I forgot. So recently I let her go to the bathroom and didn‚Äôt realize I shouldn‚Äôt have, and she didn‚Äôt come back. That‚Äôs when this lecture by my coworkers started. I will admit that I sort of just get worn down and when a student starts becoming defiant/arguing with me when I tell them no and they keep whining and nagging, and it becomes disruptive to the class, sometimes I just cave. I realized after the fact I shouldn‚Äôt have and I plan to hold my ground from now on (and try to realize who is on pass restriction.) I am honestly trying my best, and this is def my weakness. But now I keep remembering how this guy told me ‚ÄúI see you let your students walk all over you.‚Äù When he only sees me one block of the day, at the end of the day, and I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm trying my best and it just feels like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt teach high school. Did anyone feel this way their first year?

How on earth can one juggle teaching, traveling to different rooms, managing your class, managing the locker room, grading, admin work (my summative eval as a new teacher is approaching), communication with parents and admin, and all of the IEP/504/parent meetings? The way this dude talked to me seemed as though he thought I should know how to do everything day 1 as a new teacher. 

To add to all of that, I have an immune system disorder and two young toddlers at home. This happened yesterday (Friday) and Thursday night I spent 3 hours getting an infusion. This all happened Friday at the end of the day and I already had written two referrals earlier in the day. I spent extra time at work yesterday documenting all the behavioral issues that happened, then couldn‚Äôt find my fleece with my car keys in it, only to realize I was so caught up with everything that I left it out on the football field and my phone died too so I was late to pick my toddler up from daycare.

I it got me thinking whether the same (at least upto a level) can be done, with a model-agnostic approach, so I don‚Äôt have to rely on Anthropic to do it.

I got to building it, and in one day of idk-how-many coffees and some prototyping, I built Clevrr Computer - an AI Agent that can control your computer using text inputs. 

The tool is built using Langchain‚Äôs ReAct agent and a custom screen intelligence tool, here‚Äôs how it works. 

- The user asks for a task to be completed, that task is broken down into a chain-of-actions by the primary agent. 
- Before performing any task, the agent calls the `get_screen_info` tool for understanding what‚Äôs on the screen. 
- This tool is basically a multimodal llm call that first takes a screenshot of the current screen, draws gridlines around it for precise coordinate tracking, and sends the image to the llm along with the question by the master agent. 
- The response from the tool is taken by the master agent to perform computer tasks like moving the mouse, clicking, typing, etc using the `PyAutoGUI` library.

And that‚Äôs how the whole computer is controlled.

I dont really know anyone in this town in klamath falls, and honestly these might just be the emotional overload im experiencing due to losing the person i loved. 

And before anyone asks yes the separation was mainly my fault, i was a bad boyfriend, i have mental issues that never got addressed and life is leaving me behind and i am just trying to catch back up, i can‚Äôt even drive at 25‚Ä¶.. im very embarrassed.

I do have a stable job but i dont feel pleasure in it as i used to due to all of this sudden change has barely has me eating , barely sleeping, i‚Äôm panicking on moving bills, i dont really know many people around here.

And the worst of all my little kiddo is going to be taken by her that is yet to be decided but the way my life is i trust my kid to be with her more than with me, all i can do facetime my kid each day and try to visit him whenever i have more mental stability and life figured out.

And thats where we come circle around to i dont know what i want to do in life, or what to do next for my life all i really did was play videogames along side taking care of my kid it was kinda want i wanted tbh a stay at home mom while i worked, but now i dont really know where to go, where to start, what to even do.

It doesn‚Äôt help that we‚Äôve been no contact for 6 years. We broke up, I left college, spent time in the hospital, and we never spoke again. I won‚Äôt reach out because of my own pride but also I know you won‚Äôt be there. 

But every time I‚Äôm in the car in the heavy rain, I play Yellow by Coldplay because that‚Äôs what we did at the young age of 18. Driving up and down the coast of New England when we should have been in class. 

I‚Äôm gonna say something a little out of pocket here‚Ä¶ I know your new girlfriend doesn‚Äôt do that. She seems like something that comes in a girlfriend kit. Like shes plastic, made in a dollhouse. Much less work than me who still carries the darkness of my childhood home. 

I am 24 now. And I still dream about you without any reason, sometimes I still search for you on social media but you‚Äôre not active. I called you on the day of your graduation, you and I graduated at different times at different schools. The breakup kind of destroyed me tbh. I needed time off. We never spoke again but the year we had together never left my mind. 

I‚Äôm older and wiser now, I‚Äôve moved across the country and live on my own. Neither of us are kids anymore. Our faces have changed so much‚Ä¶ But just once I‚Äôd like to have coffee with you and talk about all the years that passed. The way the world changed, ours and everyone else‚Äôs. That‚Äôll never happen. Maybe in a dream, we‚Äôll be driving in the rain in your car listening to stupid Coldplay songs. Maybe. 

So if you‚Äôre ever out there and thinking of me, the answer is yes. Just ask. I don‚Äôt care where I am or what I‚Äôm doing. It‚Äôll always be you, for a roadtrip to Maine or as you said before I left, meetup in some bar someplace together. ",2,1729970489.0,DoesAnybodyElse,2,0.67,False

Hoping you all could help me.","I just moved from east coast to west coast. The prescriber, even though sessions were through doxy online, said she can no longer treat me once I‚Äôm here.  

On our last session, I decided since I won‚Äôt have health insurance next month(divorce), and that the med really stopped working (been a bit over a year, stopped working 6-7 months in) I wanted to ween off of it, then wait a few months, go back on and see if I am better equipped to utilize that burst of feeling good that rocked me when I first started taking it. I was in a really lonely environment, no family, no friends, my husband worked all day and night, so the medication could only work if my dopamine wasn‚Äôt being severely tested (I‚Äôm being poetic about it, I know how it works).   

I told her since I‚Äôm moving back to CA where I have family, friends, beautiful weather, etc etc, I will be in a better environment when the plateau starts to happen (that‚Äôs even if I get the honeymoon period again, I don‚Äôt know how that works. She didn‚Äôt either. She was the worst). 

Anyway, I was on 300xl. It‚Äôs been 7 days of two 75mg instant releases (so I can cut them when the time comes). I am feeling super lousy. Brain zaps. Fatigue. Spaced out.  

On the upside, I took some kratom and it did subside a bit. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with kratom, it‚Äôs a controversial product. It‚Äôs related to the coffee plant but works on the opiate receptors in your brain. Some people use it to get high. People like me get the proper strain and I take a low gram amount for bursts of energy. It really has been a god send but you have to be careful of dependency and take breaks and not take too much a day.  Anyway, it makes sense why this would help my symptoms.  

Does anyone have an idea of what my schedule weening off should look like? Since I‚Äôm feeling so bad, I imagine I should stay on the two 75s a bit longer before reducing. Remember I can cut the pills and I had 60 pills and have taken 13 (will be 14 by end of day)

So if any of you have a suggestion for what stain to use I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. Any other tips for making sure this comes out beautiful would also be appreciated. Thank you!

1gcs9zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1gcs9zz/you_have_to_quit_coffee/,You have to quit coffee,"This is a straight forward post, think of it as a PSA. I've had LPR for years and GERD for about a decade before I had successful surgery which cured my GERD (unfortunately not my LPR). I've tried about everything to fix my burning throat, I could write a 100 item list. Specifically for LPR, from my experience, you have to quit coffee to get to a baseline where it's even worth trying all of the other things that are out there and I think a lot of people (including myself) skip it because who doesn't love coffee?

* If your LPR is being caused by acid reflux, coffee is relaxing your LES and allowing acid to flow up into your throat. You probably need to quit the coffee forever. If you can't, cut back and switch to weak ass instant coffee if you're an espresso/filter junky. 


* If you don't have traditional GERD symptoms but have throat problems, you likely have pepsin and other stomach enzymes traveling into your throat (often at night) and the coffee is activating the pepsin and causing throat discomfort. Quit for a month and you might be lucky enough to be able to introduce a cup of coffee again. Don't drink it black. 

To wean yourself off, halve your consumption at first with the next goal being to taper down to a small amount of green/black tea consumption. Ideally you'd then cut these out too so that youre consuming next to 0 caffeine. 

Yes it sucks and for a lot of people like myself, coffee is one of the greatest pleasures in life but if you haven't tried cutting it out and you're suffering you are doing yourself a disservice. It's not going to be a panacea for everyone but I think a lot of you will feel better for it.

She got a boyfriend and completely stopped putting effort in anything but him.

I understand being in a relationship is priority but she takes TWO WEEKS to respond to one text. I‚Äôd ask if we can get dinner and I don‚Äôt get a response until 2 weeks out. Day of, she‚Äôd tell me her mental health is terrible and needs to reschedule. She‚Äôs too busy with work (she‚Äôs a bartender) or need alone time.

But she posts on social media every. single. day. I‚Äôm not kidding, she posts every hour of the day and is with her boyfriend EVERY DAY. I finally told her I didn‚Äôt appreciate the low effort and she went off on me for dismissing her mental health. 

I understand people go through all sorts of issues but it‚Äôs the fact that she blames her mental health when she still has time to go on trips and eats out with her boyfriend every day.

They‚Äôve been dating for a year and I‚Äôve seen her twice since. We used to see each other once a week. 

I text her that I wanted to discuss our friendship because I‚Äôm tired of the non-existent effort on her end and I feel disrespected with the same excuses and no responses. 

It took her 2 months to respond. Within that time, I got promoted at work and now have a boyfriend. She went off on me and said that her other friends are okay with her not responding for weeks. Am I seriously supposed to be fine with that? Especially seeing her post every single day on social media when she couldn‚Äôt respond when I ask to get a coffee? 

I told her she needs to shut the fuck up about this mental health excuse and she flipped so now the friendship is done. Which I‚Äôm honestly relieved. AITA though ",5,1729969191.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

1gcs7si,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1gcs7si/different_flare_this_time/,Different flare this time,"Hi everyone, 

I was told my pelvic floor muscles were extremely tight a year ago after experiencing frequency and non-stop urgency that coincided with my first MS flare up. I got in to see a pelvic floor therapist and it helped so much. I honestly did some exercises at home but not too many but was overall fine except that drinking coffee and having sex was impossible but I was ok giving those up. 

A year later and I‚Äôve having a different type of flare. Extreme lower back pain, butt pain, constipation, and urgency. My therapist didn‚Äôt really understand why it was happening but after a few sessions she suggested stretching me rectally. It did make a difference the first time, but I feel I have plateaued. I do daily stretching, pelvic wand vaginally and rectally daily. Sitting feels impossible.

The doc gave me gabapentin and suppositories but I don‚Äôt see a difference. He mentioned Botox could be an option but not sure when he could get me in as there‚Äôs a waiting list. 

Any advice? I‚Äôve been struggling for about a month and it‚Äôs getting really depressing. My MS has been doing well on the infusion I‚Äôm on.",3,1729969126.0,Interstitialcystitis,4,1.0,False

I've looked at some of them and maybe have an idea but if you care for a long read I'll try to be specific about my thoughts and concerns. Although this is generally about meeting people, I think I'm currently focusing a bit more on the dating aspect. 

I'm a 23-year-old Korean guy living in SoCal. The main reason for my lack of connections is the fact that I took a very untraditional path with school after high school. After graduating I did a certificate program with older classmates -> did nothing after program canceled -> online coding school -> worked a remote tech job for 1 year. After getting laid off I've spent the past year grinding through an online university to get my bachelor's within a year. Most if not all of my friends are people I've known online for about 6-10 years. I've never really felt lonely until I started thinking about how I've almost unintentionally been chronically online. I honestly don't think I lack the social skills to keep a conversation going, it's more about the opportunities and approaching part. I like to think I'm at least average in looks.

I've been trying to put myself out there more. I try to study outside at cafes multiple times a week; I sometimes visit random smaller events like farmers' markets and have spontaneously done stuff like finally visiting a rave/bar for the first time this past year. Problem being is none of these really lead to any socializing and it doesn't really feel natural besides stuff like speaking to sellers at booths. I've heard of¬†the site meetup¬†and I figured there should be a lot of events here in OC but they seem to generally be for people older than me. For some reason I also might have a weird perception of people using meetup (I know I can't judge though). I also don't think I'd connect really well with people at places like bars, combining the fact that I don't like to drink.

I tell myself that dating apps are probably the solution, but I've recently learned that it's probably not for me either. My view of dating apps has been mostly skewed into it being a platform for hookups which discourages me from trying to pursue something real from it. The whole experience just feels very empty. But the thing is some of the people I've strictly met for hookups were the ones I've actually connected to the most on a personal/emotional level. I think it's because skipping all the small talk and upping the pacing of everything just lead to a deeper connection. Experiencing this is what sort of changed me from only wanting fun to wanting something serious.

As I'm currently just a full-time student focusing on grinding my degree, I'm wondering if I should just maybe pick up a part-time job that might allow me to socialize at least a little bit (coffee shop, boba shop, idk). My main hobby has been just playing video games but it's hard to find a social group/meetup for this. I've been thinking about picking up a pottery/language/drawing class but these are paid classes I'd have to think on. Maybe I can pick up a single class from a local community college? I'm not religious, but I also wonder if a more modern and social church is a potential opportunity too. My friends tell me that I shouldn't stress about these things and let it come to me, but I try to think objectively and tell myself that not having natural opportunities means I need to put in some effort.

tl;dr: school, work, and friends were all online which led to the lack of in person connections. dating apps are seen as a hookup app for me. meetups related to hobbies are weirdly difficult to find and have interest in. where do I organically make nice friends and find a potential partner?

I met a girl there and immediately noticed we had similar interests and she's honestly exactly my type. I asked her out for a coffee, she said yes, I then clarified that it'd be a date, in my mind I wanted to make sure she understood I was attracted to her and see if that would affect her decision. She took it well it seemed but later told me that she was really shocked and thought it was way to soon to use the word ""date"". Which I agree with, I was probably too caught up in my own feelings about it.
 So far we've gone out once, I had a lot of fun even if we basically just walked and talked. In the moment she seemed to enjoy herself too but I'm not sure she did. She talks to me sure but I always am the one starting conversations and when I do she usually give a one word response. We also live in separate (close by ish) towns so we rarely talk in person, only in college and that's an if. At the same time when I text her she seems completely disinterested, if I text her ""how are you"" she'll reply ""good"" and nothing more. Yesterday I texted her and asked her if she found me annoying, she said if she did she wouldn't talk to me at all. 
 I asked her if she wants to do something again this following week, she said she has nothing else to do so why not? I'm incredibly confused. There's hope inside me but I don't know if that's good.
 I messed up a lot by pushing things too fast but even after sitting and thinking about it I do like her. She inspires me to better myself, I don't know how but I haven't felt like that before. I've also tried a lot of things to calm down about this but nothing really works too well. Anyway, thanks for reading I guess",1,1729968670.0,offmychest,5,1.0,False
1gcs1fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1gcs1fz/review_of_versatile_paris_discovery_set/,Review of Versatile Paris (Discovery Set),"**The Brand**

There are several things about this brand I really enjoy and several I don't like that much. It's undoubtedly very stylish in that fashionably utilitarian, scrubbed down, vegan, expensive minimalist way, but I'm not a minimalist at heart. I'm also not the target audience for the ""clean"" cosmetics - if anything, it's likely to put me off. To their credit, this brand doesn't promote its offerings as ""clean"", although they do describe their formula as ""healthy and free of alcohol"" (cringe) and have a ""Blacklist"" section on their website, listing their no-no's, which include stupid marketing tricks and gendered scents. Fantastic! I could do without the full list of chemicals they disapprove of, though: ""Ingredients of animal origin, animal testing, endocrine disruptors, dyes, anti-UV filters, CMR (Carcinogenic Mutagenic Reprotoxic) ingredients."" I am by no means knowledgeable enough to say whether these ingredients are truly harmful, but I'm slightly leery when a brand tells me how much better they are because their products don't include x, y, and z ingredients, usually with zero explanation on why exactly is this a good thing. I will applaud no animal ingredients and no animal testing, though - this is perfume we're talking about, not vital drugs - no animal should have to suffer so we get to smell good.

As far as I'm concerned, the best thing about Versatile is the products itself. I got the discovery set because the descriptions and notes were amongst the most unusual ones I've seen so far. Their inspiration is moments and moods in life, centered around meals and beverages. The foodie part of me was sold instantly. I bought the set with my own money. 

**The Discovery Set**

You get 8 oil-based perfumes/extracts in 1ml dabber vials, and a voucher for 15 euros off of one full bottle.  They're attached to little cards with some visuals, the name of the fragrance and the notes, but the names aren't printed on the vials themselves, so you have to take care to attach the vial back to the card, or you'll lose track of which one is which. The vials are a nightmare to open, quite frankly - I had the best luck turning the cap around while twisting it sharply to the side.

All their perfumes are a mix of natural essences and synthetic ingredients, which are meticulously listed on the website - this should make the matters a lot easier for anyone with allergies, sensitivities, or for people really invested in learning about the ingredients.

All the fragrances are between 30% and 38% of extrait de parfum diluted in a base of almond oil, and consequently, they're all a bit, well, almondy. This comes into effect in very late drydown, because that's when they all start smelling the same, vaguely sweet and a bit vegetal. So that's something to take into consideration. The other thing: these have medium to small sillage and don't fare that well in hotter weather - they faded in about 3 hours or sooner, but lasted considerably longer when I re-tested them later on in colder weather; about 8-9 hours in they're still clearly detectable on skin, although the sillage dies down after about 3-4 hours. A few from the lineup are a bit stronger and lasted longer. Versatile recommends applying them to pulse points - behind ears, crook of elbows, wrists etc. If you hit every pulse point, you can wring out a better sillage. Versatile's full bottles are 15ml for 59,99 euros, and the site claims the bottle should last 4-6 months, if you apply 1-2 times a day. I appreciate the honesty in warning you that these fragrances don't last all day, and Versatile even provides you with a formula for calculating the bang you're getting for your buck. The full bottles are also advertised as something small you can drop in your bag and take with you.

All the perfumes are conceptualised as contemporary, unisex takes on classic fragrances - they're described as neo-musk, neo-neroli, neo-tonka, and so on.

**The Fragrances**

**rital date** \- Neo-Citron  
This is the fragrance that originally got me interested in this brand, because it sounds like a whole damn Italian lunch from start to finish, and after trying them all, it's still my favourite one. It opens with a pretty good attempt at a photorealistic basil pesto, complete with olive oil and garlic, which progresses into fennel with a bit of tomato leaf, and finishes as warm sweet herbal lemon. My only complaint about this is that it's not stronger and that Versatile won't put it into a 100ml bottle of unhealthy, alcoholic EdP for me, so I can marinate myself in it every day the next summer.

**culot th√©** \- Neo-Jasmine  
In terms of behaving very differently in hotter and colder weather, this one is the worst offender. When I first tested this in the midst of the August hot wave, it was a burst of rather indolic jasmine, which progressed (but rather too slowly for my taste) into an apricot-scented green tea. My wife said it smelled like rotting fruit. I said it smelled like taking a shit in a very fancy bathroom before having a cup of lovely green tea outside said bathroom. Two months later in considerably colder temperatures, this is a nicely bitter blend of tea with some florals and apricot dancing on top of it. All in all, I think this is a well-made non-sweet floral and I do like the tea in the drydown, but beware that indolic jasmine, if you'd like to wear this in warmer weather.

**sea, sud & sun** \- Neo-Neroli  
Imagine you put on Jo Malone Orange Blossom, then went to the beach where you covered yourself in SPF, went swimming in the sea and then laid to dry off in the sun. It's a burst of neroli, followed by lots and lots of salty coconut (the official notes list figs - all I smell is coconut). There's something metallic and musky going on in there as well, like a sun-heated skin. I'm not a coconut (or fig) person, but this one is really evocative. If you want a mirage of yourself on the beach, this is it.

**dimanche flemme** \- Neo-Musk  
The ""lazy Sunday"" that starts with a burst of effervescent, freshly chopped leaves (notes say basil, I say it's closer to grass clippings, but lovely nonetheless), followed by some pistachio pastry, ending in a quite sweet vanillic musk when you went back to bed after breakfast. Like **culot th√©**, this one turns with the weather. In August, I found it overly sweet and not very interesting past the initial green bit, but retrying it in colder weather was a much more pleasing experience - the green stayed green the whole way through, lightening that musky sweetness. In fact, I'm still debating whether to spend my voucher on this one or on **rital date**.

**croissant cafe** \- Neo-Tonka  
This is Pocket Coffee chocolate bonbons, if they were of higher quality. I'm very impressed by how it manages to be bitter and sweet side by side, without the sweetness overshadowing the bitter coffee. This one literally made me get up for a second cup of coffee and some biscuits, when I first tried it out. I wish it was heavier on the coffee and lighter on the sweets though - drydown is a fairly uninspired tonka. As lovely as it is in the first half hour, the rest of it just didn't live up to the same standard for me.

**god bless cola** \- Neo-Vanille  
This one opens with a quite photorealistic combination of warm salty popcorn and freshly poured plastic cups of Cocacola. Then it progresses into a salty caramel and stays a salty caramel for the next 5 or so hours. I'm still trying to decide whether or not this is too sweet for my liking, but as far as sweet gourmands go, at least I haven't smelled this one every single time a group of Gen Z teens walked by me in the last 2 years. And it has a similar evocative factor that **sea, sud & sun** has - it's a genius loci in olfactory form, but better, because no cinema I ever went to provided me with such great smells.

**gueule de bois** \- Neo-Santal  
The name means ""hangover"", but there's certainly nothing headachey or sickening about what is probably the most masculine scent in the lineup. It's a very specific type of retro masculinity: the kind that wears unbuttoned silk shirts and gold chain necklaces and cries in Italian while getting soaked by the rain of lost love to the sounds of RnB. It's tobacco and booze on a bed of woody sweetness, eerily reminiscent of Cuba perfumes from my adolescence - the ones in bottles resembling huge cigars.

**accrodisiaque** \- Neo-Rose  
""Accro"" means something like ""addictive"" in French slang, and this fragrance is described as ""a night of sex, as seductive as it is irresistible"". I'm afraid there's absolutely nothing seductive or irresistible about it. I tried it twice so far: first time in the midst of a heatwave it developed so much that it filled a whole room and gave both me and my wife a headache. Second time, a month later in a much cooler weather, it's less aggressive, but that doesn't help much. It opens with a massive assault of an extremely acidic rose - so acidic, in fact, it's a lot more reminiscent of industrial toilet cleaner than a fresh bushel of roses. There are slashes of leather running through, and wafts of musky aldehydes. Think of a beautiful man in a leather jacket, but you're standing in a public bathroom with him right next to a urinal while he takes a piss. Then he leaves and you're left alone in a piss-soaked bathroom. The first part lasts about 30 minutes, the second part lasts about 2 hours. After that, you're left with something that resembles soap and old sweat. Zero out of ten, would not recommend. It's really insulting that this is the strongest one of the bunch. I can't report on the longevity, because I had to go scrub it off both times I tried it (and I'm not repeating the experience), but it was amazingly resistant even to soap and hot water.

I love exploring cultures through cuisines, it is also one of the ways I show love to family and friends along side words of affirmation either written or spoken. That‚Äôs why I tend to get along best with those who read and/or write - I feel like they appreciate the beauty of language and expression the most. So as mentioned I do like writing/poetry too. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone who enjoys meaningful conversations, and has a sense of humour. I appreciate kindness, genuineness, and someone who makes an effort.

Hey everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm looking to meet some new people and hopefully develop a genuine friendship. Currently preparing a cup of coffee to enjoy with some light reading or studying. I'm  a tech/computer guy job hunting after completely internship as a web developer, it's been a great experience and I'm excited to move forward. At the same time trying to broaden my horizons and develop my skills in computer science as well since I've been mostly just learning wev dev stuff. For anyone in a similar field I'd be happy to exchange stories and experiences and maybe you could help me finally decide on a couple of projects to work on, but no pressure. I enjoy reading books (though my pile of books that I've yet to finish would probably contest said claim), code (currently working on a recipe blog and also a udemy javascript course), play video games,though mainly Grim Dawn and star rail(yay new jingliu relic set). Huge fan of most From Soft games in general, albeit I've yet to play demon souls and armored core. Some other favorite games include Dragon Age, The Witcher (surprisingly all 3), Divinity Original Sin II, Dragon's Dogma, Valheim, Detroit: Become Human, Horizon Zero Dawn, Stardew Valley God of War. This went on for longer than I'd have liked so let's get back to books for a bit. I'm mostly into fantasy, and history but have also been delving into Japanese Authors over this past year and it's been great. Furthermore I listen to music a lot and would be down to share recommendations and playlists! Granted I've been listening mostly to game osts, pop and kpop but totally down to try something new. Also a fan of shows anime and impatiently waiting for the next episode of re:zero with excitement, finjdhed Love Next Door on netlfix and loved it a lot. Unsurprisingly I read manga as well and am still trying to decide on how I feel about jjk's ending. I feel that I've rambled for long enough so I'll cut this short by mentioning I love animals and would be very happy to see your pets!

I'm ""in charge"" of 7 different stations Monday and Tuesday 5 the rest of the week when my coworkers are scheduled early to help. I'm a hard worker. I only take my scheduled 30-minute break. I never take my 10-minute break or stand around and chit-chat with coworkers. I have limited my water/coffee intake so I can get things done in time. My higher-ups, coworkers, and customers are wonderful and so nice.

I'm constantly busy and running around. Management and higher-ups are constantly praising me for what a great job I'm doing. But I feel like I'm doing the work of two people, and I can't keep up mentally or physically, and im not doing a good job. My manager had to remind me of things that i forgot, and i feel bad that they have to pick up behind me and stay after me. They obviously can't hire someone just for a few hours those two days. I feel defeated, and I'm always anxious. 

I feel like someone else would be better suited, or is it all in my head?

1gcrur2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gcrur2,Review Four Seasons Maui,"Hi! I wanted to provide a review of a September trip my wife and I took. We go to FS Maui 2-4 times a year, usually on off season dates to get better rates and have less kids around. 

Where/When/Who:

- FS Maui for a 5 night trip to relax and recharge in September with my wife (no kids)
- 5 nights in a deluxe garden view room. Noe, you can see the ocean if you stand at one corner of the balcony. This was a great upgrade (thanks @alex_travels) considering we booked a Mountain View room. 

Property: 9/10

- Great property and set up like a traditional resort in a giant U shape. There are two towers and while we have stayed in both, we prefer the one closest to the lobby so we don‚Äôt have to walk as far to the pool and restaurants. 

- The adult pool is stunning and has the most beautiful overlook out into the ocean and shoreline. If you go at peak times, you need to get to the adult pool right when it opens at 7am to reserve chairs. However in September this was a non-issue and you can show up pretty much anytime and get seats. 

- We never sit at the main pool, however, one morning I was strolling near the beach paths and talking to one of the staff about the sanctuaries. These are like private small areas for 2-4 people. If you go the morning of and it‚Äôs not reserved, you can have it for FREE! These have great ocean views and are a bit more private. We did this 2 of the 5 days we were there.

- Room was clean as always, however some construction going on in the spa and lobby. It was a non-issue regarding noise and had no bearing on our stay.

- The only way this resort could be better is if they updated some of the areas like the spa, main pool, etc.. It‚Äôs a very nice resort with a great layout. 

Service: 8/10

- Usually service is fantastic however we had a snag at check in. I was using a free night certificate and forgot it at home; I didn‚Äôt know I needed to have it physically as I already made the reservation. The associate was kind, however, they were not letting me check in and I had to stand at reservations for an hour to get this sorted. I get it‚Äôs my fault, however, it seemed excessive over a certificate. I even called back home and had a neighbor go into my house and snap a photo, but that wasn‚Äôt good enough. 

- Eventually we checked in and agreed to mail the certificate when we got home. The service after this was fantastic at the pool and restaurants. Since we frequent the property, staff remember us which is a nice touch. 

- On the last day we wanted to extend our checkout by 1-2 hours and our fabulous TA (@alex_travels) was able to get this done! This property is usually very difficult to get a late checkout at however our TA made it happen.

Restaurants: 7/10

- Spago is a great view and the food is good but not great, especially for the price. One item that I think it absolutely worth it though is the fish special which is a whole fish, deboned, and lightly battered and served blooming onion style. It‚Äôs heavenly and enough for 2-3 people easily. We have had duck, chicken, and other fish dishes, however none really stood out except that one special. And be prepared to spend $400-500 for 2.

- Ferraros is fantastic for lunch and always has a great casual vibe. We absolutely love their menu and service. The pizzas are amazing, salads are wonderful, and they have great appetizers. Also, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get a spot at the bar if you don‚Äôt have a reservation.

- Duo is okay for breakfast. My wife and I are not big buffet people so usually ordered a la carte and split a breakfast entree. They are huge with the portions, especially for breakfast. 

- The lobby bar has the best mai tai with cherry foam and a good assortment of sushi. Also, they are building a proper sushi bar so can‚Äôt wait to try that out in 2025. 

- I‚Äôll mention one off property restaurant, which is the restaurant at hotel wailea. We have had breakfast and dinner there and it‚Äôs too die for. For breakfast they have the best coffee and ricotta pancakes and dinner is the best on the island. It‚Äôs expensive but justified. 

- one thing missing is more of a grab and go style. Although I hear they are building a new coffee shop and cafe for 2025.

Activities: 10/10

- For us the location is perfect. You can scuba, snorkel, go to Kihei beaches and restaurants, do luxury shopping at the shoppes, go up to haleakala, or just lie by the pool and beach sipping cocktails. 

- This FS has many complimentary activities that rotate. The day I arrived they were advertising a Sound Bath Meditation (3rd photo at adult pool). It was free and a lovely experience floating in the pool, looking up at the stars, and a perfect first night. Another activity we did was the snorkel out on the beach. This was an hour where you learned about corals and reefs and then snorkeled with a guide for 30 minutes. Note, you should be a strong swimmer for this. Other  activities include yoga and Pilates classes, sometimes mai tai classes, and other cultural experiences.

- We found we don‚Äôt usually need a car the whole stay so will rent a car for the day only. You can do this through FS directly or there is an Avis up the road you can walk to. It‚Äôs super cheap and they are great about dropping off after hours. This was you don‚Äôt pay FS parking fees. 

Lastly, do yourself a favor and book with a TA! It is well worth it and they provide so many extra perks. Also, if there‚Äôs an issue they can help resolve it quickly. ",13,1729968131.0,chubbytravel,1,0.94,False

We met during the pandemic. He had a big tech job when we met but he lost his job end of 2022 due to the tech layoffs. He took a year break on unemployment and was always so cocky to me saying he can easily find a job compared to everyone else. Well fast forward 2 years later , he can‚Äôt find a job and all of his coworkers have. I bought a house with my mom so we moved in with her. 

Since he‚Äôs living off his savings, my mom pays all the mortgage because she makes the most. While I take care of the utilities (water, electricity, trash, food) while my bf takes care of the Internet bills and his own bills.

Besides the money, he is a sports addict. All he wants to do is watch sports all day. He does not want to do anything with me. I am feeling trapped and bored. We haven‚Äôt gone out to a restaurant in months. Actually, we do nothing.

He can‚Äôt travel because he needs to save money but won‚Äôt let me travel with my friends because he feels left out. I‚Äôm tired of being at home watching sports.. also I am tired of paying for everything. Property taxes this year is 17k and he can‚Äôt contribute because he‚Äôs jobless.

We got into a fight this morning because I wanted to go out to eat and get coffee but he didn‚Äôt want to because ‚Äúit‚Äôs expensive‚Äù and he wants to watch some UFC fight in the morning.

He decided to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I had nothing else to eat so I made instant ramen. Before I even took a bite of my noodles . He kept criticizing my choice of meal and was like ‚Äúhow do you eat something to heavy first thing in the morning . How are you going to work out - doesn‚Äôt it burn your stomach‚Äù. Honestly that trigged me so I threw my ramen away and he got mad and said I had attitude problems and said fuck you to me üòÇ

We are not talking right now. I want things to work because I do care about him but I am tired 

I forgot to mention he‚Äôs really depressed because of the job market and he lost 2 of his best friends (2 years ). I think this is why he does not want to do anything. He is trying everyday to find a job so I can‚Äôt just say that he‚Äôs not trying‚Ä¶",4,1729967740.0,relationship_advice,9,0.83,False

I,xxxxx, want to file an FIR regarding rape at xxxxx station. 
I met xxxxxxxxxx on the matrimony site litimshaadi.com. I received request to connect on July, 2023 and accepted it on 21th Aug, 2023. We are connected on Whats App from
3lst Aug, 2023. We spoke on audio calls for a few times and connected on texts till Jan 2024. Xxxxxxx asked me to share marriage profile on 11th sep, 2023 to show to his family. From then, I was under the impression that his family is aware of me and he had his permission. On Dec 17,2023 I asked if his family considers horoscope, for which he w saying they look at min. Score and he doesn't consider. Also, on our call in April 2024, he promised we can tweak it a little bit if scores don't align well as my family doesn't consider horoscopes. He is a little inconsistent in following up the scheduled calls between both of us. So, I even asked if he is interested to talk further or not. I have decided to meet atleast once and then make a decision. We decided to meet in Hyderabad on Feb 3;2024. He is proactive to meet texting by himself first. We met for lunch at around 3pm on feb3,2024 and stayed until 7pm. He asked when will we meet next time and if I want to. I said I want to meet another time and will let him know when I will be in Bangalore as I have some meetings, We spoke on text on Feb 14, 2024 and said I will be in Bangalore around 11th, 18th Feb. I Said I could stay in either in HBR layout / marathahalli and he said he stays in Whitefied. I stayed in Airport Authodity of India, Brookefield dusing this visit.
We decided to meet on17th feb but it don't happen and so, planned for 18th feb. It was supposed to be for lunch, but postponed it to 4pm, then 7pm. The place was Nexus Shantiniketan mall in Whitefield.
I went by myself and he came on a bike and we met at around 7pm. After that, we had dinner over there. He came on a bike and as we wanted to go out for drive for sometime,I said I can't come on bike and change to car. He said his apartment is just behind and we can go and change the keys. We went to his apartment and then got in a car. First, we went to Udupi hotel and then had coffee. After that, he stopped at petrol bunk near to it and refilled the car.
Later, we started talking about families, about ourselves our backgrounds and such. He even mentioned that although he is in a relationship with a girl for 3 years, they never even held hands and later on she decided to marry someone else. It was more about Physical Intimacy talks like one of his friends is bisexual and does casual hookups, and one of his other friends gets physical with girls and later dumps them saying he lost feelings. When I asked if he gets angry, he gave an sexual example for it- After talking and driving around for 2-3 hrs, he stopped car somewhere to stretch his legs and take some break. I have a spinal cord issue, and I can't sit for longer times. So, I was resting in the back when stopped. That's when he pulled up my t-shirt and taken pics. He already knows about my family and background and said pics will be shared if I don't give  consent for Physical thing. I dont have phone on my hand then. I was scared that family will ostracise me if they get to know this. He also promised we will anyway marry and let this be a fun thing once in life as I have never done mischief in life. I never had any relationship in my life as I am scared of family. We spoke for few hours after this happened and he promised as we will marry, I don't even have to tell anyone and everything is secured. we spoke like until 2.30am and dispersed on friendly note and I trusted his word of marriage. I also took a promise explicitly from him that we will not talk about this to anyone or anytime from then until marriage. But I was thinking if I should share with authorities or just let it be. For 10 days, we didn't speak after that.
We met again on 8th March, 2024 in Bangalore at Chef Pillai Restaurant, Whitefield and later went to Phoenix mall. This time he asked if I wanted to drink, even though he knows I don't smoke or drink .
I declined and I came separately to that place, eventhough he said he wanted to come and pick up on bike as his car is under repair.We left at 12:30 am midnight separately. We spoke about family, his upcoming new job, my family and cousins, and plans of future. We wanted to take sometime before informing family talk as he' is in the middle of transition to newjob. That day, it was saturday and he asked if we can meet on sunday also, as I will leave on Sunday night. But later that day, he said he is busy and can't meet. For the call I made on loth mar, 2024, and dropped a message, he called back on 16th march, after reminding multiple times. That day, he said we can initiate Parents' talk after he joins xxxxxx and we can even change time of Birth if horoscope scores doesn't match. We were having calls after he joined and he started postponing parents talk saying he is busy with new company etc, During this time, he introduced his friend as I asked for help for my Business. He would immediately call back and attend calls of business at any time. He would got 2% commission if deal gets through. We had few calls but he will postpone talking to parents. I have called many times and he even stopped taking calls or calling back. So, I decided to meet him as he already asked earlier when we will meet again, We had to meet on 14th  April and he agreed on 13th also that we can meet on 14th but he went out with a friend of his and came back late evening. So, he asked to stay one more day and we met on 15th. Until the Physical thing, the first two meetings, he used to follow-up but after that, I almost, have no control as I am woried he would decline marriage, if he gets a chance, as he already started distancing. I can't even tell or report publicly because of family. I also come from a village of 2000 voters. During that meeting on 15th also, we had a little disagreement regarding Parents talks. From then till May 15th, he started giving some reasons for not taking calls. But I asked firmly that he Should talk the next day with Parents. He stopped taking calls even though I called him tens of times. I apologised eventhough it's not my mistake and he spoke after a week but he is not interested. From then, I was texting and calling him if he has changed his mind or any other reason for not talking and that I told my parents that xxxxxx is ready to talk to them. I texted and called on both numbers but he never took calls after May 12 till 16th June. And that too because I texted from a new number and he responded to that all this while but never to my number. I didnt even tell him that new number is me. And from then, he started avoiding calls like usual. On 30th June, we had a call where he was abusing me saying as why he should stickwith me- asking - are you the most beautiful or super rich a atleast guy should catch feelings after Physical intimacy. He started saying he is not interested for marriage and I can do whatever I want. He Spoke many bad words and I crossed lines with many people, and I am involved with guys. questioning character, how he doesn't even if I get an abortion, and I am shady and my family is shady. Emotional abuse is beyond tolerable levels that I involved my friend to persuade him to delete all whatsApp chats and end the relation there itself. Even though he said, he deleted and no backups but they exist. I said I will file a complaint, so he spoke for 7-8 hrs on call and convinced me not to go for it.. I agreed but said I will let his family know about this and then end it. As I don't have Parents number, I called his cousin whose number is available on Instagam. Asked his parent's number and his cousin said (xxxxxxx), it's better I talk to xxxxxx‚Äôs sibling than Parents, and he would ask him to call me, which he never made a call.
The next week I got call from xxxxxxxx and Said he got some threatening, mail and if I got any. I didn't say anything but he asked if I got any explicit/ nude images. That's when I knew it was him who sent that nude pictures.. He even threatened, he would leak more such pictures that he took on feb l8th, if I talk to his family. I didn't know what to do and left home and attempted suicide. Unfortunately, I couldn't successfully do it. After I, came back, I had to tell family why I attempted sucide and left home. So, I told them everything that happened and they disowned me. Even if I didnt consent, they don't care, and doesn't want anyone to know I was raped!
Because of family situations I couldn't report earlier. But now, if I had to face suicide or reporting this to Police, I decided to register an FIR. I was even diagnosed with clinical depression and consulting a Psychiatrist. I was raped; and he made promise of marriage deceitfully with nointention to fulfill it; I was intimidated, threatened and blackmailed; he published obscene material in electronic form; he threatened to use my private pictures; insulted and assaulted modesty & character defaming me in friends and mutually known people; and emotional, Pyschological abuse. Please kindly take action as necessary.

Thank you!

So I found out Monday I am pregnant. Husband and I have been wanting a second baby for a few years but only started trying a few months ago. My first was conceived while on birth control so while we weren't actively trying before I would get weird symptoms that made me think I may be pregnant and I'd take a test and it'd be negative. Was always a little sad but it was ok. Now that we're actively trying the negative tests were always a little more disappointing but the positive tests were exciting and what I needed. I've been so depressed lately that my entire mental state shifted into things to look forward to. Everything felt like normal pregnancy symptoms from what i remember, even though I'm still fairly early along.

Then yesterday I started bleeding, not a lot but also more than I would think would be normal. And though the bleeding is very light at this point, it's been pretty constant and I've been cramping. I don't think I'm at the point of needing to go to the er, but my body feels like it's over. The pregnancy symptoms I felt a few days ago feel gone, maybe it's just the placebo effect but my body definitely feels different. 

Today my son has his last soccer game of the season and we just got home yesterday from a trip where we traveled for a friend's wedding, so we have very little food in the house plus we're out of all of our essentials like milk and coffee. So gonna take my son to soccer, his team celebration is afterwards, and then we need to go shopping. I don't wanna do any of it but I don't think I have much of a choice, and maybe getting outside will help distract me for a little. 

I don't really have much of a point to this I just needed a place to vent because I just am having a hard time talking out loud about it right now. ",1,1729967199.0,Mommit,3,1.0,False

I (21F) set a boundary with my situationship (21M) and regret it. ,"I (21F), started seeing him (21M) around Mid-September (it‚Äôs Late October as I write this), and hit things off right away. He‚Äôs kind and generous, silly and the right amount of awkward to vibe well with me. We‚Äôd gone on many dates and had started to be physical with each other. Nothing serious but playful, getting to know you kind of touching. But things were going well and I really started to like him. 

Last week, he came over to my apartment and watched a movie together. Like any budding relationship, things started to get physical again.  For context, my freshman year of college, I was taken advantage of and that‚Äôs the reference I have for sexual experiences. Pretty negative and seriously messed with me as a result. We didn‚Äôt go ‚Äúall the way‚Äù but it was enough to trigger me  since I don‚Äôt often make myself so vulnerable around people. Especially not if that involves physicality. Long story short, I shared that it may take me a while to get comfortable before we have sex. We can continue to ‚Äúfool around‚Äù but let me get used to you for more than a couple weeks, to really trust the connection. A couple days later,  we got together for coffee and talked. I explained this boundary and he said that he wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship where he would feel like he‚Äôs pressuring me to be sexual. Fair enough! 
We ended things then and haven‚Äôt talked since. 

But now, I feel I really dropped the ball on something special. I miss him a lot and feel completely delusional with how much time I think about him. I want to experiment with him, I want to get comfortable and have a serious bond with someone like that, and I want it with him. But he may not be interested any more. Do I reach out try to fix things? Do I let him go? I don‚Äôt know but I don‚Äôt want to wait too long to find out he‚Äôs moved on if we could make it work.

But I digress! I never took my trauma very seriously until the past week. I couldn't handle it until now. And I had a very cathartic experience half yelling a lot of stuff my parents did and I had so much rage. This was vented out to my very supportive and understanding husband.

Well afterwards ofc I felt a toll on myself emotionally but I was extremely horny. I couldn't do anything ab it as I'm sick as a dog too. But I was also extremely addicted to porn as a child (11-12 when it started). Excessive masterbation sometimes 6-12 times in a row in one 'session'.

So I guess my question is this- what triggers this for any of you? Or what has your therapist/medical professional you say ab it? I'm just curious as to what to expect on this healing journey. I will be starting therapy fairly soon (insurance needs to be in order first) and I want to go in understanding at least to some degree what's going on with me so I can continue to tackle my trauma head on and make as much progress as I can.
