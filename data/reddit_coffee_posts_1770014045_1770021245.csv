1qtpgw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocknear/comments/1qtpgw2/premarket_news_report_feb_2_2026/,"PREMARKET NEWS REPORT Feb 2, 2026","**1. MAJOR NEWS**

* US — Equity futures are modestly softer after last week’s tech-led volatility, with the S&P 500 hovering just below recent record highs and the Nasdaq consolidating gains ahead of this week’s jobs data and the first full trading week under Fed chair–designate Kevin Warsh (Bloomberg, WSJ).
* US — President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell has driven a sharp repricing across assets, with the dollar rebounding from four‑year lows and long-end yields pushing higher as markets brace for faster balance‑sheet runoff despite steady policy rates (Reuters, NYT, Fed commentary).
* Global — Precious metals are unwinding part of last year’s explosive rally as gold snaps back from above **$5,000** and silver sells off more than **25%**, while copper and oil remain choppy, flagging tighter financial conditions and rising input‑cost risk for cyclicals (MarketWatch, GuruFocus).
* FX/Crypto — The dollar’s rebound and renewed Fed-hawkish bets have pressured Asian FX and crypto, with Bitcoin extending losses toward two‑month lows as traders rotate out of high‑beta risk assets (WSJ, Reuters).
* Asia/EM — Indonesian and broader EM equities remain fragile after recent index-downgrade threats and outflows, while Japan and Australia data keep global rate‑volatility elevated into key US data later this week (CNBC, Reuters).

**2. SPECULATIVE POSITIONING**

* Index options flows show call activity still comfortably ahead of puts, with a put/call volume ratio near **0.39** and open‑interest skew around **0.20**, signaling a pro‑risk stance even as short‑dated hedges pick up in mega‑cap tech – Stocknear options flow (30/01 data).
* Technology continues to dominate options premium budgets, absorbing over **$4.4B** recently versus far smaller flows into defensives, underscoring a crowded AI/growth trade – Stocknear sector flow.
* Composite sentiment sits at **58** (‘greed’), consistent with dip‑buying in US equities despite policy, tariff and AI‑capex uncertainty – multi‑source sentiment gauge.

**3. MAG7 COVERAGE**

* [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA) — Trades near **$191.13** (about **-0.7%** Friday) as China’s conditional H200 approval and a **$105M** Taiwan AI hub keep the AI‑infrastructure story intact; Street targets cluster around **$250–275** with a Buy bias, while options show elevated volatility and a bullish call tilt into late‑February earnings (Reuters, multiple brokers, Stocknear options).
* [AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) — Around **$259.48** (+**0.5%**) after a record quarter with **16%** revenue growth and **23%** iPhone sales; several brokers raised price targets toward the **$300–350** range while large upside call blocks out to 2026 (**$300** strikes) and multi‑billion‑dollar closing blocks signal ongoing institutional accumulation despite margin worries from soaring memory costs (WSJ, Sell-side, Stocknear dark‑pool/options).
* [MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT) — Near **$430.29** (about **-10%** Thursday, flat Friday) after cloud/AI revenues beat but Azure growth slowed and capex guidance surged; the analyst pack remains firmly Buy with a median target near **$605**, yet heavy deep‑in‑the‑money put blocks around the **$475–$500** strikes and tense sentiment around OpenAI exposure keep volatility elevated (CNBC, Citi, Stocknear options).
* [AMZN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMZN) — Trades around **$239.30** (about **-1.0%**) as investors weigh layoffs (\~**16k** roles), physical‑store exits and reported talks to invest up to **$50B** in OpenAI; Street remains Buy with median PT near **$300**, and options flow shows sizable June upside calls (**$245–$250**) alongside protective spring puts ahead of 05/02 earnings (WSJ, BofA, Stocknear flow).
* [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL) — Around **$338.23** (flat Friday, just off highs) as EU and UK regulators push for broader Gemini/data access and Google dismantles a major proxy‑botnet; consensus is Buy with a median PT near **$330–350**, while options and dark‑pool prints show continued call accumulation out to 2027 into 04/02 earnings (Reuters, CMA, Stocknear dark‑pool/options).
* [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META) — Near **$716.50** (about **-3.0%** Friday after a post‑earnings surge) as Q4 revenue jumped **24%** and AI‑driven ad targeting expanded margins despite capex guidance of up to **$135B** for 2026; analysts lifted PTs toward the **$825–$900** band and large call blocks in May and long‑dated 2027 strikes (**$730–$800+**) underscore confidence in AI monetization (WSJ, Guggenheim, Stocknear options).
* [TSLA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA) — Around **$430.41** (+**3.3%**) as Tesla posts its first annual revenue decline but beats Q4 EPS and pivots hard to “physical AI,” planning > **$20B** in 2026 capex for robotaxis and humanoid robots while retiring Model S/X; downside Feb–Mar puts in the **$550–$650** band and long‑dated upside calls reflect a barbell around Musk’s robotaxi/SpaceX‑xAI tie‑up narrative (Reuters, Bloomberg, Stocknear options & blocks).

**4. OTHER COMPANIES & SECTOR THEMES**

* Tech / Aerospace — [HXL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/HXL) Upgrades by Kristine Liwag (Morgan Stanley) to Equal‑Weight with **$90** PT (\~**8.6%** upside) on improving aero build‑rates and structural margin leverage (Stocknear).
* Financials / Wealth — [AMP](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMP) Upgrades by John Barnidge to Neutral with **$530** PT (\~**0.6%** upside) as higher markets offset fee compression (Stocknear).
* Software / Workflow — [NOW](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NOW) Maintains by Tyler Radke to Strong Buy with **$237** PT (\~**102.8%** implied upside), arguing investors should look through near‑term software jitters to durable automation and AI‑platform demand (Stocknear).
* Tech / Thermal & AI Infra — [MOD](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MOD) Maintains by Matt Summerville to Strong Buy with **$255** PT (\~**37.9%** upside) on leverage to data‑center cooling for AI and solid execution (Stocknear).
* Healthcare / Pharma — [TEVA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TEVA) Maintains by Louise Chen to Sector Outperform with **$40** PT (\~**21.0%** upside), citing balance‑sheet repair and pipeline optionality despite litigation overhangs (Stocknear).
* Consumer / Coffee — [SBUX](https://stocknear.com/stocks/SBUX) Reiterates by Peter Saleh to Buy with **$105** PT (\~**11.8%** upside) as traffic stabilizes and modest margin pressure from wages/commodities is seen as manageable (Stocknear).
* Financials / Insurance — [PGR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/PGR) Maintains by Meyer Shields to Market Perform with **$225** PT (\~**8.2%** upside) as strong pricing power is offset by concerns margins are near peak (Stocknear).
* Industrials / Aerospace — [TXT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TXT) Maintains by Seth Seifman to Neutral with **$90** PT (\~**2.5%** upside), reflecting steady defense/aviation demand but limited re‑rating scope (Stocknear).
* Logistics / Transport — [LSTR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/LSTR) Maintains by Lucas Servera to Hold with **$145** PT (\~**-3.3%** downside) as soft freight volumes and pricing cap near‑term upside (Stocknear).
* Biotech — [MNPR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MNPR) Maintains by Keay Nakae to Buy with **$100** PT (\~**48.5%** upside), framed as high‑risk, high‑reward oncology exposure with multiple upcoming data catalysts (Stocknear).
* Small‑Cap Financials — [GBFH](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GBFH) Maintains by Matthew Erdner to Buy with **$50** PT (\~**56.5%** upside) on asset‑sensitive balance‑sheet leverage to higher rates and improving credit metrics (Stocknear).

Overall, options, dark‑pool and news flow point to a still risk‑on but more selective tape: institutional money is rotating within AI (favoring platform and infrastructure leaders like [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META), [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA), [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL)) while tactically fading the most extended software and capex‑heavy names; stance is neutral‑to‑constructive on US equities near term, with preference for AI infrastructure winners and high‑quality cyclicals funded by trimming crowded, rate‑sensitive and long‑duration exposures.

so my struggle is that I’m pretty small (5'1) and I get really nervous. I don't want to be ""just another customer"" or, even worse, make him feel uncomfortable while he's working. what are some good ways to start a real conversation?

1. what are some low-pressure questions I can ask him that aren't about the menu?
2. since I have a drawing for him, how can I use it to spark a conversation instead of just handing it over awkwardly?
3. how can I tell if he’s being nice because it’s his job or because he’s actually interested?

For **high bar stool chairs**, back support is non-negotiable if you plan to actually use them for meals or work. The backless ones photograph beautifully but aren't practical for extended sitting.

Swivel function is surprisingly useful too - makes conversation and getting up/down much easier. And if you have kids, choose something sturdy with a wide base. I learned this after my nephew nearly toppled a wobbly designer stool!

1qtp4nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1qtp4nu/so_close_to_giving_up/,So close to giving up...,"I'm almost 38, female and currently weigh  between 188-190lbs at 172cm. I'm a UK size 12. I could do with losing another 14-21lbs.

I grew up very overweight. A few years ago, I lost around 60lbs. I maintained my weight for the most part, had two children, but since then I've found it insanely hard. 

I track my food, I reduce carbs where I can. My average daily intake is around 1400 calories a day, and I also run/work out at home 4-5 times a week, but I don't consider these calories burnt. I consider myself to be sedentary when working out my calories. It's a lot of work but I'm happy to do it. But recently, it just kind of stopped working? 

If I have a social thing planned, I'll amend my intake to reflect this - even if I need to skip lunch or dinner, I'll factor in any extra drinks. I rarely eat out (maybe once every couple of months, and I still track). Even still tracking calories and never going over my maintainence (around 1900), the scale just seems to shoot up. 

I appreciate water weight exists, but eventually I should be seeing a down trend somewhere? Libra says I'm over eating by 1500 calories a day, which is not the case. My weight increases by about 5-6lbs if I deviate from 1400 calories a day, then takes a week to start coming off, at which point it's often the weekend again. 

I just can't seem to lose anything unless I'm 100% committed to 1400 calories a day, with exercise, etc, and even then it's painfully slow. The second I move away from this, even if it's healthy and still within maintenence, my body seems to rebel. I feel bloated, visibly bigger, and the weight just clings onto me. I haven't actually ""lost"" any weight since November and on the scales, I'm 9lbs up, but I can honestly say at no point in that period did I eat or drink enough to warrant that (I wish!). 

What can I do? I was hoping a ""refeed"" over Christmas might sort anything out if it was something to do with metabolism but it hasn't. It's getting to the point where I don't want to do anything with friends, because I'm desperate to lose weight. I'm anxious over everything I eat - but nobody else seems to have to go to this extreme to lose weight? I end up cutting out meals, which really worries my husband, but it's the only way I've seen an impact. 

Breakfast is usually a normal coffee and a protein yoghurt, lunch is tuna (sometimes on one piece of bread, sometimes not), and dinner is usually vegetables and a protein source. Oils, butter, etc, all tracked. 

Blood tests all come back fine - historically, thyroid has always been perfect. No obvious insulin resistance. 

I just feel insanely depressed. I'm doing everything right on paper but I feel like there's one glaringly obvious thing I'm not doing?? 

My mother, who is 154cm tall and incredibly slim, weighs 140lbs, so part of me wonders if maybe it's a body composition thing? But I don't think that's a real thing - I think there's just something I'm not noticing. Is losing weight when you're closer to your goal this much harder? Did having the big loss all those years ago skew my experience of weight loss??

Been like this for 17 years.

I grew up with a psycho raging alcoholic Dad. I swore I would never end up like that.

I nearly dropped out of high school and ran away. But I couldn’t because I felt overprotective of my baby sister and my Mom.

The rest of my siblings jumped ship and left the house young. My parents owned a business and forced me and my siblings to work 13 hour days on our feet and we were told by mom to never complain since my dad did not tolerate negativity. They would pull us from school to work as kids during the busy seasons. The 90’s were a weird time.

My Dad drove his business into the ground because of his alcoholism.

I got bullied relentlessly for being poor.

Then my friends from high school went away to college. They all lived a life I dreamed of. They were gifted IPhones, brand new cars, etc. They treated their parents like shit. If I ever spoke to my parents like they did. I would have no teeth.

I had to work at a coffee shop for 2 years to save up for cosmetology school.

These high school friends peer pressured me into drinking once they dormed at college in the city. I got hooked immediately. Been chasing the dragon ever since then. So many negative consequences within the last 3 years.

I have been struggling with alcoholism and drug addiction for years. Wish I could be normal like everyone else. Don’t have kids. Never want them. Too much trauma. I’m ending the generational curse with me.

I feel like I am destined for so much more.

I wasted almost 2 decades getting wasted.

Sober now. But keep slipping.

I’m so jealous of all the rich, entitled people I went to high school with. My household was legit like the TV show “shameless” but more reserved if that makes sense.

1qtosby,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1qtosby/a_cautionary_tale_sahm_edition/,A cautionary tale SAHM edition,"My husband treats me like I am his domestic servant. I doubt it’d be better when I go back to work full time. But he’s called me his “subordinate” before while upset a few months back. He comes and goes when he pleases. He makes appointments without consulting me. He makes plans with his friends without consulting me. The only time he seems to spend with us is if there’s nothing better going on. He does no real parenting. He doesn’t do any night wake ups (and our child gets up 6+ times some nights so I’ve just resorted to sleeping in their room on a floor bed). If I’m lucky he will wake up early whenever the baby wakes up (but my husband says he sleeps poorly because he stays up all night worried about work.) He creates these imaginary problems. He’s fine. If I ask for help or I insinuate that he’s not doing his fair share he reminds me that he pays for everything right now! What a stand up guy. And I do everything for our child and lives but you act like you’re in charge. You can’t even find a replacement roll of toilet paper. 

He left yesterday for an off roading trip. He was gone from 6am-3:30 pm. Never told me when he was leaving to come back he just showed up. He gets home and tells me “the dog is dirty he needs a bath.” He asks me “what’s for dinner?” As if I wasn’t alone with a sick baby all day. The baby is so clingy to me he won’t even nap by himself at this time. I had two minutes of alone time yesterday while I snuck away but then he realized and was up screaming. I was genuinely looking forward to him coming home so I could give him some parenting responsibility. Lmao that was a dumb want. 

My husband doesn’t let me walk away whenever he is with the baby. Whenever he is I walk away and just have a moment by quietly putting away laundry or something that is truly a luxury. If I want help I have to ask my in laws (who are so fucking weird and I don’t feel comfortable with them watching our son for long periods of time) or hire a babysitter. So I have to hire a babysitter. My parents live 3,000 miles away or they would be such wonderful help. No my husband won’t move there as he hates where my parents live. It’s all about him and his happiness and why would we leave HIS family who drop us off food multiple times per week (sometimes it’s pink chicken and all of my husbands favorites. Mommy’s little boy!) 

I was proud of my son (11 month) for copying me as I cleaned the windows. He picked up a rag and started doing the cleaning motion on the window. This is a beautiful cognitive skill and I love watching his mirror neurons develop. My husband says “you need to teach him other skills than cleaning.” I’m literally one person. I have to clean or else I’m bitched at. What do you want me to teach him? How to change a lightbulb? He’s already walking and is super friendly/social. 

My husband doesn’t want me to return to work full time since he travels. I have to, though. I need a way to support myself and my son if and when we separate. He’s treated me so poorly this first year of motherhood. I’ve done it all alone while his life has gone on uninterrupted. He has felt so out of control by me changing that he threatened to divorce me countless times and even suggested to me he gets an open relationship for himself since I have no time for him. I have no time for even myself. He has so much freedom while I have none. I didn’t realize motherhood meant giving up any sort of independence I had. I don’t have a partner I can rely on. My son is so needy and I have no time to myself. My husband cannot handle the baby’s moods or poopy diapers. He acts like he is going to pass away. 

I am so grateful I have my masters degree and a 6 figure career. I gave it up to be a SAHM and a wife to the most ungrateful man. This is why people warn you about being a SAHM because your life could turn out like this. 

You think you’d be excited for your husband to get home from a trip or an outing because you’d have a break. Someone who understands why I desperately need to drive to a coffee shop and just sit there in silence. The only time I get a break is if the baby naps in the stroller. At night I can get small breaks but my husband wants me to cuddle him to sleep. There’s no more space left for me and it’s starting to swallow me whole. I love my son more than anything and the love he has for his mama is so pure. But he doesn’t deserve to grow up seeing his mom being treated to poorly by his father. Like wtf is that going to show him? That despite mommy doing EVERYTHING and all emotional labor it’s never enough. The bar is always raised higher. I’m under the microscope for literally everything. Couples counseling isn’t an option as my husband has turned it down countless times. He has a therapist but they don’t hear the real story they hear his crafted stories that he stays up all night perfecting then claiming he’s so tired because he works so hard. He literally has a room to himself and doesn’t handle the baby at night and I want to throat punch him. And the funny thing is he wants another child HA. The fuck I think not.

A few days ago, a conversation with a waitress there became more personal than usual and we ended up talking for a couple of hours. She opened up about some personal things and said she’s always found me friendly/likable. During the conversation, she also mentioned that some of the long-time regulars there tend to watch out for her when customers get creepy (she’s family of the owner), and that they’ve told her they usually leave earlier when I’m around because they feel she’s fine then (wierd). She added that she feels safe when I’m there as well.



I normally avoid hitting on people while they’re working, because I don’t like putting someone in a position where they can’t easily pull away or shut things down. That’s part of why I’m trying to be careful here. Later I said something like, “Would you like to continue this somewhere else one day?” She said yes, so I asked for her number and she gave it to me. When I was leaving, she also told me to come by for coffee the next morning.



I did. We chatted briefly (the place was packed so I didn't want to bother her too much), she was friendly, and she paid for one of my coffees. When she gave me her number the day before, she also mentioned that she sometimes replies very late to texts (up to 10–15 hours) which I have no idea why she would say. That evening I texted her, thanked her for the coffee, and suggested grabbing a drink later this week. It’s now been about 12 hours with no reply.



I’m not planning to double text or push anything - I’m more curious in general: when you give someone your number and are at least somewhat interested, how quickly do you usually reply? Does a long gap early on mean much to you, or not really?

My wife (29f) and I (31m) have been married for five years. No kids yet. We generally have a healthy relationship and not many disagreements happen, but if they do we usually talk things out and move on. That’s why this situation has me second guessing myself a bit.

So earlier this week, we got into an argument over plans with friends. She had agreed to host a small get together this weekend, but I had already committed us to something else without realizing the dates overlapped. That’s on me 100% … I owned that and apologized. Still, she was pretty upset and said that I “never check with her first.” … I admit I pushed back a little and said it was a genuine mistake, but was definitely not disregarding her.

Things cooled off later that evening, or so I thought…

The next day we ran errands together. On the way home, the tension came back up in the car and we exchanged a few snippy comments. Nothing too crazy, just clearly unresolved frustration. When we pulled into a shopping center, she said she needed to run into a store and asked me to wait in the car.

About 20 minutes pass. Then 30. I texted asking if everything was okay. No response.

After nearly 45 minutes, she finally comes back hands full with carrying coffee and acting totally relaxed. I asked what took so long, and she said, “I needed time to calm down, and you needed time to sit with how annoying you were being.”

I laughed at first because I thought she was joking. Buttttt She wasn’t.

She told me she deliberately took her time because she felt I hadn’t taken responsibility during our argument, and this was her way of “creating space.” I told her that leaving me sitting there without a word felt unnecessary and kind of humiliating. She shrugged and said, “You weren’t in danger. You were just inconvenienced.”

When we got home, I told her it really bothered me, not so much the waiting, but the intent behind it. She said I was overreacting and that if I hadn’t been defensive earlier, none of it would’ve happened. She also said I should be grateful she didn’t “escalate things further.”

That comment stuck with me. Like wtf quite frankly…

This kind of behavior isn’t normal for her, which is why I’m struggling to process it. I’m trying to figure out if I’m being overly sensitive or if this crossed a line into something more controlling.

Even the Pilates Eros…I’m revising that. I think it was my Eros she responded to not my Psyche. I’m trying to figure out the placement. It’s not moon or mercury. I’ll have to think on it.

I still have these waves of pain and I feel like I’m gonna cry uncontrollably but then I remember it’s just pain and I contain it and carry on. If I’m at home I let myself cry. If I get triggered and angry I walk away or move my body or something to set myself free of the stress.

I’m definitely in the rebirth phase. I’m starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with basic life, like the sky isn’t constantly falling. Psyche crawling out of the underworld successfully with no help like 👍

No problem guys I handled it! Thanks for the help.

If you want to know who you married 1) see how they treat you when you’re sick and 2) see how cooperative they are while traveling. My wife ruined every vacation, worked every holiday and was ice cold when I was sick. I loved her but damn I paid for it. Even when I told her about this…she was a complete bitch to me. I wasn’t allowed to be vulnerable at my most vulnerable. That wasn’t cool at all. I refuse to age with someone like that.

Thank god that relationship is over. Idk what I was thinking. I kept trying to leave and Covid really trapped me.

Now that this archetype is pretty much over I’m feeling better. I miss me. I miss feeling peaceful. I miss being who I was before I met my exwife.

I just want my morning coffee at the Dogpark, good food, a comfortable bed, money and for people to leave me alone more or less. I’m low maintenance and lowkey af. I need someone to match that speed of life.

I’m not 20 or 30. I’m old, I’m tired. I want quiet, I want stability and home.

Now that I’m out of the underworld I don’t expect an Eros. I don’t expect a relationship. I’m honestly hoping to just be myself without the burden of this game. If I meet someone great, but after everything I’ve been through emotionally, physically and psychologically…I need a whole new speed of person. I can’t do the rollercoaster thing anymore. X and Y are hyper af. The highs and lows burned me out! My body is tired! I don’t have capacity or stamina to do this again. I want a slow walk on the beach or hiking for a date with a normal person who doesn’t have me feeling stressed and wound up and freaking out.

Dear inner Psyche in Leo and 5th house moon….hear me out here…perhaps we can modify the souls search for love to something new? What was fun and attractive when I was young isn’t anymore.

In 3 weeks Saturn won’t be opposite my Venus/Rising anymore. Then I wait on Uranus to leave Taurus. Gosh, I can’t wait.

You know what’s funny? Even if it was psychosis, how was I able to accurately feel out an Eros to my Psyche? I found the pattern not knowing the Greek myth. Astrologically, each Eros was conjunct or trine my Psyche. 3 trines were exact and the conjunction was within a few degrees.

That’s incredible. The other funny thing…when I first read the story and realized how bad I screwed up and also I might be lowkey In psychosis was when a guy who had been possessed by Pan reached out and made friends with me. He was really sweet. I hope he’s doing well. He deserves all good things.

I wasn’t in Psychosis like he was though. He thought he was Pan. I thought I was me. I was just living out the myth but I was never not “me”. I still look around and wonder…cause I never identified as Psyche and I reluctantly played the game to escape. My motivation was to endure to get to the end because once you get to the end it’s over.

Did I pass? Has suffering concluded? “The beating will continue until morale improves.” Ok, she’s going to choose him over me. It hurts. Over and over and over. I get it. I feel it. I’ve felt it a 1000 times. It stings a little but I’ll walk it off. It’s nothing I haven’t experienced before.

I’m tired of being Psyche. I’m free of it. I don’t need this anymore. I don’t need old patterns either. It’s time for new. Whatever that means.

Idk if life will listen to me but seriously guys…can this story be over? I’m ready. I’ve been ready.

I gotta go back and read the book. Am I there yet? I think so. Seems legit? I passed the test. I finished the game. I ate the whole enchilada. Can I clock out now? This has been one of the longest, hardest jobs of my life.

Let’s see what my guru has planned. Only he knows. I keep side eyeing him like…bro you really gonna put me through all this without properly finishing the story? I wanna trust he’s not gonna leave me hanging after all this work. Although I am grateful for the healing path. That’s exactly what I prayed for. I’m lucky it worked. I shouldn’t be so selfish asking for more. But it’s not selfish to ask for what you need and want is it?

I’m glad I don’t know how it ends. I need the peace.

Ugh….get me through April. I may curse like a sailor and have massive attitude but I’m still classy and civilized. I want the rest of my life to match that Libra vibe. I’m more and more committed to embodying that Libra stellium, and people around me need to comply with the standards or I’ll be forced to balance the scales.

Edit: I was thinking about my friend Pan. He had a personal psychosis. Is this a collective psychosis? Like, most of the people involved didn’t know each other but archetype constellated in and through all of us? Most people have no idea. I haven’t volunteered anything. It is in the collective though…not just me. That’s actually a good question. Am I the only one paying close enough attention? Or even thinking to ask? ",1,1770017416.0,u_NewNeptuneSaturn,0,1.0,False

When we started dating, we had unbelievable chemistry, we had a strong connection, desire, passion and love. Within months of dating, that changed. All the sudden, we fell into a “routine.” We both had our work, we lived together, but very separately due to different schedules. He was switching between shifts while I had usual 9-5. We were still happy and having sex once a month was not bothering me. We still had connection. We would watch a movie, show, eat together, have coffee, go for walks and so on. We get married. We get pregnant. While we were TTC we had sex 3-4 times a month and it felt amazing. We got pregnant very shortly afterwards (2 months) and went into no sex for whole 9 months and 6 months postpartum. It bothered me. I voiced it. He said our parenting differences, my personality changes affected his connection with me and he has to be in a better marriage. I respected that. I worked on myself, got to a good place. Nothing changed. We would have sex maybe every 3-4 months. He would go to bed WAY later than me and I would not be able to initiate it even. Having spontaneous sex is just completely out of picture. We worked on our marriage, rebuild our relationship and started feeling connected again. Decided to have another child. We had sex once that month we decided to TTC  and I got pregnant. We did not have sex 9 months, had once when I was 4 months postpartum and not again. I am currently 10 months postpartum.

I am feeling lonely. I am feeling undesirable, unattractive. I am feeling like I was used to bring kids to the world and make him a father. I feel like I was not his soulmate. I feel like I was not his best friend and that he settled for me. I tried bringing up a topic and he shifts it into a “don’t blame your personal insecurities on me, you should work on yourself so you don’t feel that way.” I stop bringing it up, I stopped initiating as we are never together. I stopped asking for dates, to find a movie to watch or flowers. I stopped talking as every conversation turned into a mindset lecture.

I am aware that this is a temporary hard phase. Sleep deprivation, very strongly opinionated older child, stressful work. I still love him. I still desire him and miss the person I fell in love with.",2,1770017343.0,DeadBedrooms,4,1.0,False

1qtoi9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Investment_Partner/comments/1qtoi9a/the_drunk_neighbor_parody_price_vs_value_why_you/,The Drunk Neighbor Parody | Price vs. Value : Why you shouldn't panic sell your Stock Portfolio during a Market Crash.,"We often talk about ""Price"" and ""Value"" as if they are the same thing. They aren't. And the reason most investors panic during a market correction is that they confuse the two.

Here is the best way to understand the difference: **The House Analogy.**

Imagine you buy a house for ₹1 Crore. You buy it because it has 3 bedrooms, it's near a good school, and the foundation is solid. You plan to live there for 10 years.

Now, imagine you have a crazy neighbor. Let's call him ""Mr. Market.""

Every morning, Mr. Market stands on your lawn and yells out a price for your house.

* **Monday:** ""I'll give you ₹1.2 Crores for the house! It's a boom!""
* **Tuesday:** ""The economy is bad! Your house is only worth ₹60 Lakhs today!""
* **Wednesday:** ""Wait, interest rates changed! I'll give you ₹90 Lakhs!""

**The Question:**  
On Tuesday, when he screams that your house is worth only ₹60 Lakhs... do you panic? Do you pack your bags, sell the house immediately, and move out because you ""lost money""?

**No.**

You ignore him. You go back inside, make coffee, and sleep in your 3-bedroom house. Why?

1. Because the **Utility (Value)** of the house hasn't changed. It still has 3 bedrooms. It still shelters your family.
2. Because you aren't planning to sell today anyway.

**Now, look at your Stock Portfolio.**  
Stocks are just partial ownership in businesses.

* **Value:** The cash flow, the products, the brand, the management (The ""Bedrooms"").
* **Price:** The red or green number flashing on your screen (The ""Crazy Neighbor"").

When the market crashes, it’s just the neighbor yelling a lower price. The business (the house) is usually fine.

Stop letting the crazy neighbor dictate your mood. If you wouldn't sell your home because of a low-ball offer, don't sell your long-term portfolio because of a bad news cycle.

I switched off the keyboard, turned it upside down, took out the keys  only post which the keyboard worked for 2 days, after drying out the coffee and with only the num pad enter not working, 2 days after the entire QWERTY row stopped working, at first i thought it was the keys, replaced them with other keys and same effect , looked like the PCB was done. I reached out to AULA India who quoted 6k for repairs plus sending the keyboard to them and back, which would come to 6.5-7k considering courier costs.

So i need help getting another replacement, I have looked for a bit, i can still get another F99 pro and will have plenty of spares left, but i also want to try something new preferably with a volume knob. If i can swap the LEOBOG Nimbus's to the new keyboard that would be great. A couple of people have recommended the below :

1. NuPhy Node 100
2. Weikav WK MAX102 
3. Barebones Q1 Qmk

Am also open to getting something used and then replacing the keys and keycaps as long as the Aula ones fit in it considering am prone to spillage.

Would appreciate your inputs on the same.

I consumed a cup of tea and began my workout approximately 5 minutes later. Shortly after starting, I experienced severe nausea followed by vomiting, which forced me to stop the session.

Upon reflecting, this may be due to:

	•	Milk and sugar in tea slowing digestion

	•	Increased gastric acidity combined with physical exertion

	•	Starting exercise too soon after consumption

Black coffee, which I usually tolerate well before workouts, has never caused this issue for me. However, tea clearly did not suit my body as a pre-workout beverage.

Sharing this as a cautionary note:

If you are sensitive to digestion or acidity, tea may not be an ideal choice immediately before exercise, especially with minimal time gap.

3. I then proceeded to filter off the solution using a regular brown coffee filter

4. Once i had let the solution cool to around room temperature (it felt a little lukewarm, but not hot), i added a small crystal of the Epsom salt to the solution. I should note that by this time, a thin crystal layer was already forming on the top as the solution was cooling. 

5. Let it sit overnight. 

  
Did I not let it cool enough prior to adding the starter crystal? Thats the only idea I have as to why it formed lots of smaller crystals.

2. **Standard Hybrid/Immersion:** I tweaked the recipe and saw a big improvement in sweetness and body, but I'm still feeling like the flavor notes are muddled together. I’m missing that distinct separation and ""sparkle.""

 I suspect the constant immersion is muting the acidity, but I'm hesitant to go full V60 (open valve) because of the risk of channeling/under-saturation with such dense beans during the bloom.

So, I’ve drafted this specific **Closed Bloom -> Open Pour** workflow to get the best of both worlds.

**The Recipe:**

* **Brewer:** Hario Switch (02)
* **Coffee:** Apollon's Gold (Ultra-light)
* **Dose:** 17g
* **Ratio:** 1:18 (Total water: \~306g)
* **Water:** Third Wave Water / Soft water at 98°C (208°F)
* **Grinder:** Zerno Z1
* **Grind Size:** \~540 microns (um)

**The Steps:**

1. **0:00 - Bloom (Valve CLOSED):** Pour \~50g water (approx 3x coffee weight).
2. **Agitation:** I use a WDT tool or spoon to aggressively agitate the bloom. Since the valve is closed, I want to ensure 100% saturation of the dense beans without losing water.
3. **0:45 - Open Valve:** Release the switch. Let the bloom water drain.
4. **0:50 - First Pour (Valve OPEN):** Pour up to \~180g in a slow, circular motion.
5. **1:30 - Second Pour (Valve OPEN):** Pour to total weight (306g).
6. **Total Brew Time:** Aiming for \~3:00-3:15.

The closed bloom acts as a ""safety net"" to fully saturate and degas the coffee, preventing channeling. Opening the valve for the main pours ensures a constant flow of fresh water (percolation) to highlight the acidity and clarity that was missing in the immersion recipes.

Has anyone experimented with this specific ""Closed Bloom only"" workflow for Nordic roasts? Do you think this will solve the ""muddled"" flavor issue with this specific grind size/ratio, or should I change the pouring structure?

The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it.","I originally posted this a year ago today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ig5a26/groundhog_day_ned_ryerson_is_the_devil_and_he/)):

**First and foremost:** 

When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, ""Well-ha-ha! Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!"" 

The ""first step"" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is able to enjoy.

**Secondly:**

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him.

**A tertiary point:**

Immediately after Phil takes his ""first step"" into his hellish torment, the framing of the shot prominently shows a red coffee cup with steam coming off it as Ned laughs devilishly. http://i.imgur.com/IL0ti5t.jpg. Perhaps this symbolizes the firey torment of hell, directed at Phil as Ned points his finger at him.

Further corroborating that this is religious symbology...note the framing when Ned finally releases Phil from his perdition: http://i.imgur.com/Avvvil7.jpg

Phil's head is illuminated in a halo of light reminiscent of the Christ, and the groundhogs appear above his head in a Holy cross. 

**A point that just occurred to me:**

Consider this: in this day and age, buying a shit-ton of life insurance is as close as you can get to selling your soul to someone.

**Summary:**

Phil's journey didn't involve his betterment as a person or getting Rita interested in him. Instead he was cast into damnation by Ned when he insulted him and refused his insurance, and he was absolved of his sin when he finally bought it and treated him respectfully.",16,1770015622.0,FanTheories,2,0.9,False

Well we are both managers you know…so we basically see each other everyday. So when I started working I would buy drinks like coffee tea for the people on the shift. And it has become a thing now but just me and that guy. When I work mornings I would offer him like coffee since mainly coffee shops open early (sometimes he texted me to ask if I’m going anywhere to pick up breakfast or coffee and if so he would ask me to get him something) and when he would pull up to work at his scheduled time he brings me food. To sum it up we always give and return to each other. I don’t see anything weird with that cus it’s a mutual thing hopefully in a friendly way.

When I go on my breaks he sometime also goes on break but on weeknds he always sits with me to eat and talk

So there are older people at put jobs spreading rumors that we might be a thing because of that. I promise y’all that there isn’t anything.

Recently the days that I close he’s been staying to actually close with me when apparently he hasn’t stayed for as long with the other managers. I thought it was kind of weird but again I recently got promoted so I’m just thinking he’s making sure I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing.

So as a manager I was told that I wasn’t able to leave the store because I’m the only manager on duty. So I stated getting this habit of just sitting in the office on my break but still doing some computer work.

And lately he’s been staying on my shifts to cover breaks so I went on my break last and just went to sit down in the office. He then goes into the office and just sat next to me asking me why am I working for free. And I had just told him because I wasn’t hungry and didn’t have anything to do. So he then closed the door in the office and started talking to be about his private life and I ended also taking about my life.

And ever since that day he’s always calling me into the office not to talk about work but to talk about each other and I did ask why does he close the office door (mind you I don’t want more rumors going around) and he completely ignores my question.

Another thing I’m still learning how to do schedules so he was showing me how to make a schedule and he kept getting out of topic and continuing talking about himself and asking about my life. And so like I ended asking a lot of questions to avoid getting off topic. And I notice that when I would put my main focus on the computer he would stare really hard at me i don’t know how to describe it. But when i turned to look at him he would quickly turn to look at the computer.  Maybe I’m dragging it..I don’t know

Also before he used to be super serious and now he laughs at everything I say or do. He even points out little habits I do like squinting my eyes to see better, or even point out things like my ankle bracelets. But I get weirded out because why is he picking up on little things. Is he interested or just being friendly??",1,1770015266.0,bodylanguage,2,0.66,False
1qtnyfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qtnyfs/back_to_dating_and_im_done_playing_nice_these_men/,Back to dating and I’m done playing nice — these men get ZERO access now. Any other tactics?,"I’m back on dating apps after a break and I’ve completely changed how I operate. This is no longer romantic, hopeful, or “let’s see where it goes.” It’s tactical and intentional.

I’m not interested in giving access to men who bring nothing but entitlement and excuses.

At this point in my life, **men who are unattractive, sexually unappealing, out of shape, short, balding, sloppy, desperate, cheap, rushed, emotionally needy, unemployed, broke, uneducated, uncultured, living with their parents, addicted, lacking discipline, no car, no home, no real life experience, no travel, no foreign language, no hobbies, no responsibility — do not get access to me. At all.**

Not my time.  
Not my energy.  
Not my emotions.  
Not my body.

I’m done with the pattern where a guy wants closeness immediately with zero effort. No more “coffee dates” that turn into expectations. No bar dates. No car hangouts. No “let’s just vibe” nonsense. No rushing intimacy. No emotional dumping. No pretending we’re in a relationship after 2–3 low-effort meetups.

For me now, **the first 10 dates come with zero emotional intimacy, zero sex, zero personal disclosure**. No private life details, no vulnerability, no access. Car, home, trips, weekends, emotions — all off limits. If that scares him off, good. That’s the point.

I don’t “manage” men anymore.  
I don’t educate them.  
I don’t fix them.  
I don’t motivate them.

If a man is inconsistent, cheap, unclear, evasive, lazy, or tries to guilt me with “you’re cold / distant / guarded” — he’s out immediately. Those lines are just manipulation for faster access.

Also: **no real name, no phone number, no address, no social media early on.** Way too many men get obsessive, stalk, harass, or reappear months later. I don’t owe anyone permanent access just because we matched.

Yes, I know this sounds strict. I don’t care. It works.

And before anyone asks: yes, I’m matching with very attractive, wealthy, well-dressed, confident men right now. All photo-verified. We’ll see who’s real and who isn’t — but at least now I’m filtering from a position of control instead of hope.

So my question to the women here (or anyone dating strategically):

**What other tactics or rules have you used that actually saved you time, energy, and sanity?**  
Any red flags you now eliminate instantly?  
Any boundaries that changed everything for you?

I do remember that feeling inside me, as a 26-year-old male smoker, and I don't care about my family. Now as a 29-year-old I am not a smoker and I hate smoking and thank god I quit smoking. But from my financial perspective, I feel like I haven't changed a lot which I hate this feeling inside me.

I am trying to change, but I feel like it's so hard to overcome the gradual phase, I do remember that fitness coach when I asked him why I am still mediocre, and why I am not changing. And he told me you will gradually overcome any phase that you are facing in any chapter of your life and eventually he is right, the saddest thing is about to change is you need to change your system, your habits, and it is step by step. Otherwise, you will not be changing, and you will be stuck.

Liquid Brun: This is essentially a ""warm hug"" in a bottle.Think creamy vanilla mixed with a bit of spice. It’s sweet but sophisticated, perfect for when the air gets crisp and you’re wearing a coat.

Khamrah Qahwa: If you like the original Khamrah, this is her more mature, caffeinated cousin. It’s got that signature boozy, apple-pie sweetness, but the added coffee note makes it darker and less ""sugar-overload."" It’s cozy, loud, and lasts forever on clothes.

☀️ SUMMER 

Khadlaj Island: This one is pure vacation vibes. It’s light, coconutty, and very easy to wear when the sun is Sunning. It doesn't last too long ...it just makes you smell clean and slightly fruity.

AAM Kaaf: This is a hidden gem for the heat. It’s a beastly performer for a fresh fragrance. It smells like high-quality laundry mixed with a cool sea breeze.

💼 WORK

Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Man: The ""MAN"" scent. While the opening can be a bit sharp (like lemon cleaner for the first 5 minutes), the dry down is legendary. It projects confidence and smells ""expensive"" to everyone else in the workplace.

🎩 SPECIAL OCCASIONS

Hawas Elixir: It’s sweet, spicy, and very ""loud."" This isn't for a quiet dinner; it’s for a wedding, a big party, or a night out where you want people to notice you the moment you walk into the room. It’s modern and very mass-appealing.

🏋️ GYM

Rue Broca Theoreme:  It’s zesty and sharp enough to cut through the smell of a sweaty gym without being ""perfumy"" or cloying. It just smells like you’ve got your life together while you’re hitting a PR. It last so long in the gym.

1qtnsj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qtnsj2/canvas_of_carnage/,Canvas of Carnage,"I hate this school, everyone's the same. I tend to hide out in the art department that’s completely isolated from the rest of the school. There are several strange paintings here deemed inappropriate for the students. My favorite being the painting that depicts a skeleton taking a blood bath. It really speaks to me. The idea of bathing in the blood of your enemies really inspires me.



I read online that if I ever wanted to summon the devil I would need to do a blood ritual. I heard from one of the teachers that the painting is supposedly made from real blood. Legend has it that the artist made a pact with a demon to erase one of her memories. It's a hauntingly beautiful piece.



As I stood there, lost in my thoughts, the sound of footsteps approached. I turned to see Irvin, a dorky student I'd seen around before, making his way towards me.



""Hey there!"" he greeted with a wide smile. ""I've seen you hanging around here quite a bit. Mind if I join you?""



""Um, sure,"" I replied, somewhat reluctantly.



Irvin plopped down beside me, his enthusiasm undimmed by my reserved demeanor. ""So, what's your take on this painting?"" he asked.



""I hate this painting,"" I muttered.



""I wish they would just take it down.""



""Cool,"" Irvin said with a nonchalant shrug. He then reached into his bag, pulling out a small spatula and a scalpel. With practiced ease, he carefully used the spatula to scrape off a small piece of the paint from the canvas. I watched in surprise as he held up the sample, a mischievous glint in his eyes.



""Then you won't mind if I do this,"" he said. I couldn't pretend not to care about the painting.



""Hey, wait, what are you doing? What are you doing with that?"" I blurted out.



Irvin paused, his hand holding the small sample of paint mid-air. He turned to me with a quizzical expression.



""Why do you care?"" he asked, genuinely curious. I hesitated, grappling with my conflicting emotions.



""I... I don't really care. It's just a stupid painting,"" I lied, my voice barely above a whisper.



I watched him tuck the sample away.



""Alright then,"" Irvin said, zipping up his bag. ""I'll catch you later.""



With a wave, Irvin turned and headed towards the door of the art department, his footsteps echoing softly against the tiled floor.



As the door closed behind him, I was once again left alone with the painting.



The clock ticked. There was a note under my cup of coffee. Books lined the walls. Irvin plopped down across from me, too casual this time.

""You always sit here, huh"" he asked. Hands tucked into his hoodie pocket.

"" I like this spot, you can hear everything from here"" I said.

He dug in his bag. Pulling a tiny scrap of tinfoil on the table.

""“Go ahead,” he said. “Touch it. See what happens.”

I unfolded the tinfoil it smelled odd. My fingers hovered over the scrap.

""Nah, im good, what the hell is it"" Irvin leaned back

 ""Proof,"" he said. ""Blood. Mixed with paint. From the painting downstairs.



I leaned my elbows on the table, resting my chin on my hands.

""You're something else.... you know if the art department finds out, they will expell you right? You have brought heat the chillest place I know!”

"" Relax I'm sure it will be fine"" he said.



The PA system crackled.

“Irvin Jagr—report to the office immediately.”



Irvin grabbed his bag, hoodie swishing, and stood.

"" I'm sure its unrelated"" I snorted.

""Keep it safe,” he said. “Don’t do anything stupid.”

I nodded and flipped him the bird.



Now what to do with this obsessive love letter under my cup. I recognized the handwriting immediately. Clark. My lab partner.

He always pressed too hard with the pen. Like the page owed him something.



I slid the note out, skimmed it once, then folded it smaller than it needed to be. It wasn’t bad. Just… a lot. The kind of thing that looks harmless until someone decides it isn’t and in this shitty school it will spread like wildfire.



A chair scraped somewhere behind me. I didn’t look.

I tucked the note into my pocket anyway.



Bell rang. Chairs moved. Noise came back all at once.

I stayed seated until the room thinned out.



When I stood, the tinfoil was still there. I wrapped it once more, tighter this time, and slipped it into my bag.

Two things I shouldn’t be carrying.



The bio lab was still locked. I slid the spare key from my wallet. I always forget to give it back. The lights flickered when I flipped them on. I washed my hands out of habit.



The microscope was already out. One of the newer ones with the tablet attachment. Overkill for a school lab, but the school liked their toys. I pulled the tinfoil free and peeled it back just enough. 



I placed it on a slide. Added a drop of saline. Slid it under the scope.



The screen blinked on.



At first, nothing. Just texture. Cracks. Pigment clumps.

Then I adjusted the focus.



Cells.



“Lili?”



I jumped. Almost knocked the slide off.



Clark stood in the doorway, backpack slung over one shoulder. He looked tired. 



“You’re skipping club,” he said.



I didn’t answer. I didn’t minimize the screen either.



He stepped closer. Leaned in. Squinted.



""I cant see it without my glasses, whatcha looking at? water bears again? 



I slid the tablet a few inches away from him instead of closer.



“Hey, you wrote this?” I asked.



His eyes flicked to my jacket pocket before I finished the sentence. 



“Figured you didn’t want it making the rounds.”



He didn’t smile.  Just crossed his arms.



“Are you serious?” he said.



“Yes” I replied 



“You shouldn’t out yourself like that in this place.”

I muttered, stashing the sample back into my bag. “This school is … gossipy.”



He blinked. Then he started talking faster, almost tripping over himself. “I mean, it’s not like anyone else cares, —she’s so genuine and—she’s just so nice and funny, and I just—I didn’t mean for anyone to see it.""



""I dont appreciate your tone"" I scolded.



""Well I dont like what youre up to, its messed up."" he stormed of. 



It made me so angry, how dare he treat me this way.  I could have let it go there. That would’ve been the decent thing. But decency depends on timing, and  people who don’t plan ahead deserve to be put down.



I took out my phone and rang him.



""Clark where did you go, can you please walk me home?""



If he couldn’t recognize that I was trying to help him, then maybe he wasn’t equipped to keep himself safe. Some people need decisions made for them.",1,1770014681.0,scarystories,0,0.67,False

Today I learned that Einstein Bagels is part of Panera Bread.  In fact, it's an example of how so many restaurants out there are owned by a relatively small number of holding companies.

Einstein Brothers was formed in the eighties from, of all places, Boston Market, and created by combining a number of smaller, regional bagel chains that were basically doing the same things in their own areas.  Einstein was bought out by megaconglomerate JAB Holdings, and then later became part of Panera Bread, along with sister-companies Bruegger's Bagels, Noah's Bagels, Manhattan Bagel, Peet's Coffee, Caribou Coffee, and Pret a Manger. All under the same umbrella.  If you thought it all tasted the same, then maybe it's not your imagination.

When you think of bagels (or, rather, the Americanized version of the bagel, that is), you usually think of mornings and breakfast.  But Einstein Bros. does offer a line of bagel sandwiches for lunch as well.  In my opinion the 'bagel' is an under-utilized bread, and perfect for whenever a roll or bun is used.  I have made hamburger sliders using a bagel for the bun, and it's awesome.  I don't know why there aren't more burger bagels.

At Einstein's, I ordered a turkey deli sandwich on a bagel.  A fairly simple sandwich, with all the dressings (tomato, lettuce, etc), and that's fine.  Simple can be perfectly good.  And this was a decent sandwich, not too large, not too small, with fresh ingredients.  Frankly any cold deli sandwich would do well with a bagel for the bread.  And maybe more people should consider Einstein's instead of the various sub sandwich chains once in a while.  Especially considering this was a good five bucks cheaper than most sub chains - granted it's not a foot long, but it's about the size you want for a lunch meal.  

Good stuff.  Worth considering for future visits.

The logic is that, I believe, the brain constantly tries to spam random thoughts into consciousness, such as distractions or anxiety and fear for the exam or something. But when sleep deprived, the brain gets tired and stops doing that and goes from multithreading to single threading. That means if ur able to make that last single thing ur brain can still focus on the exam, it makes u perform better.

I have been meeting a 28 f NRI citizen via arranged marriage.

I have been the one scheduling these dates and contacting her first. She is great when we meet up and follows up when I ask her out for the next date but never reaches out to me first. It's usually complete radio silence between the dates. I added her on insta and we had a day of chat there but she then again moved the chat to text/sms. He discuss deep things when in person but she seems like someone who either does not reciprocate the interest or is a very very busy person (with the job, family, and dog?).

1qtnly6,https://i.redd.it/pxh3gb8l01hg1.jpeg,Coming down from actually living out one of my recurring nightmares for a whole week,"Already typed this out in detail once then it got erased when I got a phonecall, so here's a slightly abridged version.

Long story short, I came into work last Monday to find out literally everyone else at my job was leaving for the week, and it was on me to run everything and also meet all the deadlines my coworkers had already set for the entire 7 day stretch. This exact situation is a recurring stress dream I already have, though it has never actually happened before. Mental health deteriorated as the week went on. Working 11 hour days alone except for the constant flow of people at the front desk and 3 phone lines ringing, having to take the fall for every single one of my coworkers' fuckups they left behind, and getting overwhelmed with the workload and deadlines of an entire staff really fucked me up bad and sent my major anxiety disorder to the fucking moon. First panic attack was Wednesday, by Friday I was not eating.

This morning my boss came back and we had to do inventory, which is always the most stressful day of the month. I was shaking really bad and thought it was another panic attack taking its time until we realized the heat had gone out and I'm actually shivering. Don't know how long it had been out, I know I was shaking Saturday too. Fighting with the person I'm seeing because I've come to the independent conclusion that she hates me based on all my internal dialogues about what she must be thinking. I keep it together at least on the surface for almost the entire day, then in the last hour I start to fall apart. Boss gives me one last project to finish then says I can go home. As I'm working on it I start to have a meltdown, and I sit there trying to focus while violently shaking and trying not to cry too loud or hyperventilate too much in front of the boss. He must have noticed, no way he couldn't have. He thanked me in an uncharacteristically sincere and not sarcastic way. Couldn't look at him or talk without breaking on the way out, just gave him a thumbs up. Panic attack on the drive home, more once I got to my bed.

7 hours now since I got home. Talked it out with lady friend, we're on good terms. Heart rate is just now starting to go down, not light headed anymore, still shaky and ears are still ringing, still crying a little every now and again but a lot less than before. Have tomorrow off, then back to work Tuesday. Don't know if I'll actually go in.
