Obviously, I can read this is bad.

However, they deemed I wasn't in immediate danger, as they then sent me out to the waiting room for 4 hours after. After 4 hours of being curled up in a wheel chair I vomited ALL of the contents of my stomach.

I immediately felt better, all symptoms went away. Have not had them in 24 hours.

The last ECG and x rays I had 4 months ago showed high rate but was otherwise normal. Chest x rays showed no heart enlargement, lungs normal, CAT scan showed no blockages.

Could this be caused by High stress? I started a new night position and been drinking a lot of coffee. Sleep schedule has been fucked as well.

I told her that I can make changes in myself if that’s what you want, but she said no, She can’t date me, then she said that I might have everything but I don’t have what she wants, in the end I told her that I still have feelings for her, and for me it’s gonna be the same in the future too, now it’s on you how you interpret it, I have made myself clear.

So anyways her group presented today in my science learning class and they did a good job! I wanted to ask her a question about her presentation but she left right when class was over, (she does that a lot). I thought ""Damn since next week is fall break I likely wont see her for two weeks!"".

THEN like an hour later after I got something to eat and walked over to this computer lab I like to sit in, she walks right by me! I immediately called her name and me and her had a nice chat! She is really nice to talk to! We talked for maybe four minutes! She had a big smile on her face as well when I told her a joke! I told her our writing professor is a tough grader but not the toughest one I have ever had! I then told her how I had a professor from community college who is still to this day the harshest grader I have ever had! She seemed like she wanted to keep walking and talking but I said ""well I will see you in class tonight on the computer"".

She did seem to really enjoy it like I did! She is really nice to talk to and she is so cute! She reminds me of Ariana Grande without the plastic surgery and homewrecking!

1o14j1p,https://i.redd.it/hb1z4nfwhutf1.png,"I made this: Trespot, a city-based chat app for travelers (free)","Hey everyone! 👋 I’ve been building Trespot, a super simple way for travelers (especially solo travelers) to meet people in the same city, swap insider tips, and plan quick meetups without the awkwardness.

With Trespot you can:

* Join city chat rooms (Goa, New York, Bangkok, etc.) to find travel partners and last-minute plan ideas
* Verify trips by uploading a ticket (keeps chats real & spam-free) or join with limited messages if you’re just checking a city out
* Share and browse activities/photos from the people actually there (hidden gems, cheap eats, nightlife, rentals)
* DM privately from profiles to find your next trip BFF
* Get notified when your city access is approved & when someone messages you
* See upcoming trips in your profile so you can coordinate meetups ahead of time

Why I built it  
Most trip meetups feel scattered across random groups. I wanted one place where verified travelers can instantly talk to others in the same city and actually meet up for coffee, hikes, coworking, or exploring.

It’s free. I’d love feedback from real travelers what would make this genuinely useful on the road?

I don’t have a team in this country, my boss and coworkers live in the UK. We just have an office used by our separate engineering team. The site leader there wants office presence and at first wanted me there once a week (3 hour commute each way).

I moved close to the office, but I‘m sitting at a desk alone. There are no weekly get togethers, no coffees, lunches. They are very closed to others outside of engineering.

The town isn’t high quality either and there are no social or professional benefits. That site leader isn’t in my chain of command.

I asked my boss if I can work remotely as I don’t have a team (approx. 50% of our global workforce is remote, but this site leader wants people close).

My boss said as long as I can make it to the capital city that’s fine.

The issue is that 1) I don’t have a team in the capital 2) home prices have increases 16-20% so I’m priced out of the market for purchasing a one bedroom flat.

There is a nice town 2 hours away, that’s affordable, where I can be productive. But it seems not possible.

I‘m feeling a bit stuck now. Also, it’s been about a year of isolation. People just aren’t friendly or open to socializing here. I wasn’t expecting such a cultural shock.

It seems I either get a higher paying job in the capital or keep pushing and hope one day they would allow me to work more remote since I don’t have a team. Even my boss and his boss are remote.

It has been a while since I last posted. My wife died of cancer 13 months ago. Life has been quite a struggle since then. I really don't need to explain to you how that goes.

Loosing her was like falling into and sinking in a deep, cold, dark lake. The first few months I struggled to just get air in my lungs. It took me several more months just to be able to float and stop sinking. The past few weeks, I have felt strong enough to attempt to swim towards a shore (wherever that it).

I am still grieving deeply for her. I know I won't stop grieving her. I also feel very lonely and isolated. I think you all know that the intimacy of marriage cannot be replaced by friends, not matter how many or close they are. My closest friends have been wonderful. But 13 months in, they have returned back to their normal distances, if you follow my drift. They are not around as much as they were 10 months ago, which is natural.

So, the only way I can imagine feeling less lonely is to try to connect to new people. I've had beer and coffees with some people, testing if new friendships can develop. In that vein I recently I asked a person to get a coffee, the same way I have done it before. Just looking for companionship and friendship as usual. But the thing is, I know I find that person... well let's say, extra interesting. 

What I am wrestling with, is the realization that I have, for the first time, allowed myself the possibility of going out with someone that I find... extra interesting ;-). Because of that realization, my head started spinning with overthinking and millions of what if scenarios. What does it mean to grieve my wife and also find someone else I might want to know better? How to handle it? Etc. Etc. 

I know the standard answers. I am human being, so looking for a new person in my life at my age (or any) was bound to happen at some point. Still, the cross currents of feelings and thought and grief are quite disorienting.

How did you all (if you did) navigate such moments?

Sorry for the long rant and thanks for the ideas.

What do you honestly find interesting living in Korea. 

I know the bad side of it is the crime rates and the government literally working their country to the bone and the government etc. woman not being able to work while having kids but also the forceful way that they are trying to get people to have children. Which is the reason out of many I wouldn’t live there forever however  do want to go visit for a long period of time.

I gave cocaine an honest go. The first time I fell asleep. I thought maybe I just had drank too much that night (I was told it’s supposed to sober you up?) so the next time I only had 2-3 drinks and while I did stay awake ish, it wasn’t energizing? Not sure it did much and I fell asleep earlier than I would have if I had just been drinking. Alcohol is supposed to be a depressant but I get more energized. 

MDMA has always made me very calm and happy BUT absolutely zero energy, I do not like moving. I am pleasantly happy curled up in a blanket around a campfire chatting with friends, or laying in the grass on a warm day at a festival. I’ve never experienced this said energizing euphoria. I thought maybe it’s the environment that makes a difference. So I tried doing it at a rave - I ended up chilling in the lounge area for a lot of it as I didn’t find enjoyment (or energy) dancing. I did try though, and it honestly made me a little less angry about all the people bumping into me. I typically don’t drink anything other than water/gatorade when I take mdma. 

Mushrooms vary, when I’m not anxious I tend to learn more on the low energy side. With LSD though I do find it energizing and stay awake and find I have a normal response in comparison to my friends for that one! I’d be impressed if someone managed to fall asleep on acid.

Modafinil (100 mg 2x per day) worked for a bit until it didn’t, I would build up tolerance annoyingly fast even with breaks and I didn’t want to take more as I knew it could interfere with my birth control. 

The first time I was prescribed 5 mg dextroamphetamine IR I fell asleep for 5 hours. It was actually refreshing. 20 mg vyvanse was hell, it felt like someone gave me a heavy sedative and I thought I was going to get into a car accident while driving. I tried it for a week but I was a shell of a human I was so exhausted - ironically it drops my blood pressure. The 10 mg dexedrine SR version was tolerable. So I currently take 15-20 mg dexedrine SR in the morning and another 10-15 mg SR in the afternoon. It mostly does the job of keeping me awake but I’ve just been getting so brain foggy on it. Additionally I usually drink 3 cups of coffee a day. It’s never affected my ability to sleep. And I need to be careful not to sleep/nap within the first 2 hours of taking it otherwise I will stay asleep. 

I don’t know, has anyone else ever had this experience? I’m wondering if maybe it’s something genetic related in terms of drug metabolism.

Cooking for the house when given the duty is NOT wrong, but it's interesting why only women are given the task. The men conveniently say ""I can't cook"" (weaponised incompetence btw) and so all the girls have to switch between each other. Even Farhana didn't know how to cook, but she learnt right? What's the issue with the men then? I've only seen Mridul and Pranit being around to cut veggies, ek tadka lagaana seekhna is not hard. I believe kunicka will be happy to teach people. 

Now, Neelam cooking for the whole house is not the problem. The problem lies in her cooking extra stuff for her group people, even chai coffees and all. Bhai ek insaan apni chai ni bana skta? Malti raised a good point waha, if people make individual food of their own then extras should stop too, jispe her reaction was not very nice. If you're doing naukargiri willingly then you're just a people pleaser mate, sorry.

About Gaurav, i don't know what he's thinking. He could literally play a HUGE part in the game from kitchen, because in past people have reached to even winning positions by making hold, but he would rather just enjoy the paid vacation. Like you can cook professionally in a whole MasterChef competition but not personally even help the ladies who cook for 15 people and then use that against them in the task? Insane 😭

My end opinion is that put these men in kitchen, if they know cooking or not. They'll learn if they don't, sabji banana is NOT rocket science. They're adults, mostly in the age range of 25-45, every adult of this age should know how to cook for atleast themselves.

*Grimshaw County has a dozen stories that start the same way: empty road, low fog, and old county lore warning people to stay away. This case is no different. Ridge Road is a dead end, and it goes by another name — Deadman’s Hollow. It is said that a farmer who used to own the land at the end of the road back in the 1960’s caught one of the local boys up in his hay loft with his eldest daughter. He told the boy that if he ever caught him with his daughter or on his property again, he wouldn’t live to try once more. Naturally, this did not deter the young man. He came back, several times. The farmer figured out where the boy was coming on to the property at. He got there just before dusk and planted his truck off in the brush, hiding it under some branches to camouflage it. As anticipated, the boy came back that very night. Coasting his way onto the shoulder. He exited his vehicle and started towards the property line. Just as his hand came to rest on the fence to hop over, a raggedy old truck engine roared to life. The boy panicked and dashed towards his car. He clambered in, started the engine and through it into reverse propelling himself backward into the night! The farmer was hot on his heels. The truck burst through the foliage and into the night. There they sat, in the middle of the road, nose to nose. The young man’s headlights shown into the cab of the truck to reveal the rage of a vengeful father intent on keeping his promise. The kid did a K-turn but as he did, the farmer turned on his headlights, blinding him. The farmer laid on the gas, plowing to the side of the boy’s car and launching him into the embankment. There were no survivors.*  

*Legend has is if you take your girl to the end of Dead Man’s Hallow, and try to reverse out of the dead end, a pair of head lights will appear and chase you to the end of the road.*

Is it normal?","It’s been 15 months of dating my boyfriend and I have never felt this way with anyone else in the past. I had a 5 year relationship history with an ex and it didn’t make me feel anything like this then. Later in life, many other guys came to my life in a hope to pursue a relationship but I didn’t click with any one of them. I used to be a very outgoing and socially sound person. I would meet people, go on small coffee dates with guys when I was single and never felt uncomfortable around men (unless they try something sexually disgusting). But since I have started dating my now boyfriend, I feel complete. I don’t feel the need to make new friendships or even know a man if I have no solid reason for that. I am very much ok with hanging out with his guy friends when he makes me a part of their hangouts and we even hosted dinner at my apartment for his guy friends and I never felt anything uncomfortable, infact quite happy and fun. But in my personal life, a lot have changed. Now I don’t feel like meeting any of my male friends alone (except 3 of my guy friends back from school). I once went out with a very good college friend just for a hangout, and I never felt this kind of discomfort ever. I constantly missed my boyfriend. I would cancel all meeting plans whenever a past male friend would ask me to meet. I would rather sit back home and do crocheting, skincare, cook, or just pass time with my sister at home than meet anyone without my boyfriend being around. 

Is this normal? My past self would never do this I am sure. ",3,1759907274.0,Advice,14,0.8,False

I’ve gone through models that cater to different needs—whether you like to keep it simple, prefer full control, or need something that works with pods. Here are my top five picks:

* [**Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV**](https://technorokie.com/technivorm-moccamaster)
* [**Fellow Aiden Precision Drip Coffee Maker**](https://technorokie.com/fellow-aiden-precision-drip-coffee-maker/)

* [**OXO Brew 8 Cup**](https://technorokie.com/oxo-brew-8-cup/)

Let's look at each of them:

# [1. Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV](https://technorokie.com/technivorm-moccamaster)

A favorite among coffee purists, the Moccamaster delivers smooth, balanced coffee every time. It uses a pump-free system to heat water to the optimal brewing temperature and completes a full pot (40 oz) in just 4–6 minutes. The brew-volume selector is great for small or large batches, and the auto shut-off and 5-year warranty add extra peace of mind.

# [2. Fellow Aiden Precision Drip Coffee Maker](https://technorokie.com/fellow-aiden-precision-drip-coffee-maker/)

Looks modern, brews like a pro. The Aiden gives you temperature precision, a bloom cycle, and a thermal carafe that keeps your coffee hot for hours. It supports both single serve and full batches without compromising flavor. One-touch brewing, a removable water tank, and even a schedule feature make it a solid smart pick.

# [3. Breville Precision Coffee Machine](https://technorokie.com/breville-precision-brewer/)

This one’s a dream for control freaks. You get six brewing modes—Gold, Strong, Fast, Cold Brew, Iced, and a fully customizable My Brew setting. It uses PID temperature control and gives you options to adjust bloom time, flow rate, and filter type. Whether you want floral pour-over or a bold pot, it nails it every time.

# [4. Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301](https://technorokie.com/ninja-dualbrew-pro-cfp301-drip-coffee-maker/)

If your household mixes pods and grounds, this is your all-in-one solution. Brew K-Cups or full carafes, choose from four brew styles (Classic, Rich, Over Ice, or Specialty), and even use the built-in frother. It’s got a dedicated hot water system for soups or tea, and the adjustable reservoir fits wherever you need it.

# [5. OXO Brew 8 Cup](https://technorokie.com/oxo-brew-8-cup/)

For those who want great coffee without too many settings. It’s SCA-certified and delivers both single cups and carafes with even water distribution thanks to the Rainmaker showerhead. It has a thermal carafe, compact size, and precision temperature control. Bonus: it fits under most cabinets.

Verdict

If you want a simple, reliable brew every morning, the Technivorm Moccamaster or OXO Brew 8 Cup are great picks. For more advanced control and café-level results, go for the Fellow Aiden or Breville Precision Brewer. And if you need flexibility with pods, grounds, and multiple brew sizes, the Ninja DualBrew Pro delivers serious versatility.",1,1759906828.0,u_Creative_Long8343,0,1.0,False

Currently drowning in a 20-page evidence-based practice paper on a topic I swear my professor just invented, and it got me thinking. We all have that one assignment that lives in our nightmares forever.

For me, it was last semester's community health project. We had to create an entire public health campaign, complete with a budget, educational pamphlets, and a 15-page rationale citing local epidemiological data. It wasn't just an assignment; it was a full-time, unpaid job for six weeks. I think I survived on stale coffee and pure spite.

So, what's yours? Was it a brutal care plan for a patient with 17 comorbidities? A group project where you did all the work? That one pathophysiology exam that felt like it was written in another language?

Due to recent events I have decided to document the occurrences a little more thoroughly.

I’ve been adding to this post over the last few weeks as developments arise, and I’ve honestly been using it as a chance to sort out my thoughts. I apologize for the lack of objectivity, it’s been getting harder to maintain recently. 

Anyway, that’s enough introduction.

The next target has been found.



I first saw them working at a large chain coffee shop. At first it was impossible to determine who the actual subject was, as the room was packed with people. Half a dozen baristas shuffled around, taking orders, mixing drinks. Their shift went by; plenty of customers coming and going, a lunchtime rush,and a few impassioned conversations about mistaken orders.

It wasn’t until late in the day, when they got off of work, that I found out who the subject was. They were a relatively tall and thin individual, wearing the standard issue black polo shirt and baseball cap. They rode a bike home at a slow pace, dodging pedestrians, dogs, and some poorly parked cars, eventually arriving at an apartment complex. It was a little run-down, but not to the point that it would decrease quality of life too much. The camera at the top of the stairwell had some cobwebs in front of the lens.

Their apartment was small, but adequate for a single person. The kitchen was more or less just a sink and a stove, the bathroom just a toilet and a shower, the bedroom just a twin bed and a nightstand.

Despite the size it seemed rather comfortable. There were a large variety of house plants on the window sill and on the table. Some were in jars of water, like they had just been cut from a neighbor’s garden. There were posters on the wall of movies and bands, clothes discarded in a pile by the bed, a birdfeeder outside the window. Compared to the last individual’s house (and honestly compared to mine) it felt cozy; lived-in.



I can already feel the next couple weeks of my life disappearing.



\------------------------------



I had another video call with my grandma today. This is the most I’ve talked to her in a long time, but still not as frequently as I would like.

She asked me how my studies have been, as she always would. She never fails to check up on me, see how I’m doing, make sure I’m on the right track. She always knows when I’m slacking off. I could never fool her.

She’s an amazing grandma; the most remarkable person I know. Her and my grandpa split when my mom was in college, so she worked as a nurse for decades. How she was able to survive those awful shifts for as long as she did will always baffle me.

I was her only grandchild for about a decade, so we always had a special connection. She would let me get away with murder.



It doesn’t seem like she’s doing well. I know she has had a few health complications given her age, but I could tell that they’ve progressed more than I realized. I need to reach out to her more often.



\------------------------------



Whenever they get home to their apartment, they seem to change. They take off their hat and their hair falls to their shoulders, and they adjust the self-cut bangs that usually remained hidden. They often spend their evenings in their bedroom, putting on makeup and stuffing socks in their shirt. At work, they’re a somewhat average-looking young man, but at home, they shift into something else. I can’t say I’ve ever seen anything like it, so I can’t help but find it intriguing, though a bit jarring.

  


I enjoy the one-sided company of this unique person a lot more than the last one. They live a pretty quiet life, seemingly preferring the comfort and safety of their apartment to the city outside. I can’t help but feel a kinship with them.



Once again, my opinion of the subject was not shared by the people on FairSeas



“I am so f\*\*\*ing sick of this b\*\*\*\*”

“This freak is so boring”

“i cant wait for this p\*\*\*y to disappear”

“Hes headed for the asylum”

“that would be too good for him”

“can someone just kill that reprobate”

“he’s a waste of oxygen”



That’s the last conversation I have from them, as I left the group chat shortly after.



\------------------------------



One of their coworkers has been showing a lot of interest in them lately. She’s a girl about the same age as them. She has a rather unconventional manner of dress, with hair bleached underneath, and she often wears heavy makeup. Her demeanor is very laid-back and outgoing. They spend a significant amount of time together, often taking breaks at the same time and talking about things I can only guess.

The times when they are together are the only times where they seem to be having a good time around other people. I wish I could hear the topics that they discuss, and the jokes that they laugh at together.

I wish I could just sit there and listen.

I suppose I have been sitting with them in a way. These two strangers are kind of the closest thing I have to peer companionship at the moment.



I think I’m losing it.



\------------------------------



I’ve been having difficulty keeping up with Tsikuri recently. My grandma’s in the hospital. Her heart’s been getting weaker. It seems like it’s only a matter of time.

I’ve been joining the Rest Home call room every day, so it’s been interfering with my viewing of the website. This is probably for the best though. It’s better to be around actual people; better to have real connections. It doesn’t feel like enough. It all feels hollow.



There’s usually a few other people there, sometimes a dozen or so. Despite the circumstances, It’s really nice to see how many people care for my grandma. My mom spends almost all of her time there. She doesn’t seem to be taking it very well.

I think she has a lot of regrets. I mentioned before that my relationship with my grandma had been distant for a long time, and a big part of that was because of my parents. Not that it was their fault, it really was mine to be honest...



My relationship with my grandma changed when I was 8. At that time I would spend almost every weekend at her house; gardening with her, taking food to her neighbors' houses. She was by no means the best cook in the world, but she would always know someone who could use a free meal.

One day I was at a town hall meeting with my parents. They were very involved in the community, like all decent citizens. One of the other adults there, attempting to make conversation with me, asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I had always disliked that question, as I never really had many life-long aspirations. This time though, one thing came to mind. I answered:

“I want to be a grandma.”

I can still clearly see the reactions of the people around me. The concerned looks of the other adults nearby, the shame on my parents’ faces.

After the meeting, my parents tried to explain to me that it was impossible for me to be a grandma. Maybe I should’ve understood at that age, but for some reason I couldn’t wrap my little head around it.

“But Grandma’s the best person in the world! I wanna be just like her! Grandma says I can be anything I want to be, and I want to be a grandma!”



The next weekend, my parents said that I wouldn’t be going to her house. It didn’t seem too abnormal at first, but as more weekends came and I still wasn’t allowed to see her I began to grow worried.

“Where is Grandma? Is she sick?”

They said she was fine, just on a trip.

“When is she coming back?”

They said they didn’t know, but that it would be soon.

“What about her garden? If me and Grandma aren’t there how are they gonna drink their water?”

They said not to worry about it, that I should not think about my grandma for a bit.

I couldn’t let it go.



The next day when my mom was making lunch, I snuck out of the house. I had to know if my grandma was okay.



Having only ever paid attention to the first few seconds of the drive, I had no idea where I was going. I walked to the end of our block and made the first turn. When I reached the end of the second block I stopped at the corner. I looked down the street to find that I already didn’t recognize where I was. The almost identical houses and similar-sounding street names melted together in my mind, and for the first time the weight of my decision fell to the bottom of my stomach.

A man who had been trimming his hedges in his yard across the street approached me, likely concerned for the well-being of a confused, wandering child.

I asked him if he knew where my grandma’s house was, not realizing how obtuse of a question that was. I guess I got lucky, because he was able to tell me exactly where to go.

I thanked him and followed what I remembered of his directions to the best of my childish memory. After just a few more blocks I once again lost track of where I was headed. A woman watching her kids play in the yard asked if I was alright, and I posed the same question I had to the man. She similarly pointed me in the right direction.

I went on like this for what felt like hours, walking a few blocks, coming across an adult who seemed to know where I was headed and trudging on towards my destination. As I walked further and further there seemed to be more and more adults out in their yards. Elderly gentlemen in rocking chairs on their parallel porches, younger men washing their identical cars. Eventually almost every other house had a person standing there, acting busy with one thing or another. Some women would just stand in their doorways while talking on their phones and point without me as much as approaching them.

I still don’t understand how everyone knew where I needed to go. At the time I was far too drained to find that suspicious, and my throat was too parched to want to use it. I would think now that I had just been walking in circles, lost in the labyrinth of driveways and lawns, if I hadn’t arrived at my grandmother’s house before the afternoon was over.

I stopped in the driveway to rest my aching feet and burning shins, then slowly inched up to the door, scared of what I might find inside. I raised my hand to knock, but before my knuckles made contact with the wood, it swung open and my grandma’s arms swooped me up in a hug. It was a firm, almost suffocating hug. I clung to her, mostly to hide the emotion on face, finally feeling relief from the days of worry and hours of lost anxiety. By the time the hug was over her shoulder was stained with tears and snot.

My grandma immediately drove me back to my house. My parents handled my disappearance with a kind sternness. My mother made me eat dinner in my room that night.



After that day, my parents tried to get me to connect with other adults, but I was never interested in any of them. Those men would ask me about my life, my studies, my life goals; but I never knew what to talk about with them. It just wasn’t the same as talking to my grandma.



Damn, I feel so stupid. I took so much of my mother’s time with her own mom away. All because of an idiotic remark, and my foolish curiosity.

\------------------------------



My lecture this week was about integrity; about following the law at all times, because you never know if you’re being watched. Normally I would find this encouraging, a motivator to be the best person I can be. Now that I can see what it’s like to have your whole life displayed for others to judge, it feels a little different.



Every second is a chance to break the rules. What if there’s a rule I don’t know I’m breaking? How long can I last until I mess up?

I do my best to be a good person and follow the guidelines of our city, but there’s so many gray areas, so many differing opinions. My old acquaintances would say that using foul language isn’t a violation, but some of the older people I know have said that calling someone “stupid” is something to be ashamed of.



It’s getting hard to do anything. My brain is filled with constant calculations of what is noble, what is evil, what is wasteful, what is optimal.

Everything I do matters, everything I say matters, everything I think matters.



I wish I could shut my mind off.

I wish I would get sent to the asylum sometimes.

They could clean out my brain and tell me what to do.

I could sleepwalk through the rest of my life, unburdened by the weight of my conscience.



\------------------------------



Today they had their coworker over to their apartment. She walked with them and their bike after work, taking a leisurely pace. Despite the long trip they both didn’t seem to mind, chatting and laughing as they usually did.

They would stop occasionally to look at the nearby stores, observing cats in windows and art displays.



When they finally made it home, they locked up their bike and climbed up the stairs.

They were starting to look nervous. This was the first time that anyone else had entered their house in all of the time that I had been watching.



After the shortest house tour I’ve ever seen, they both sat down on their bed. Their anxiety seemed to be building even more, one hand massaging the other, and their legs crossing back and forth. As they talked the mood became much more serious. She looked at them, contemplating something. At one point a tear or two fell down their face. As she saw those small tears, she hugged them.

After an earnest embrace, she held them at arms’ length. She took off their hat, and adjusted their long, thick hair.

They looked embarrassed, she looked excited.

They showed her the makeup they kept in their room, and the few pieces of feminine clothing they had scavenged. They spent the rest of the night trying on clothes, applying makeup, and braiding hair; the joy of the two friends palpable, even through the pixels of my screen.



This shouldn’t be right. Should it?



\------------------------------



Grandma’s gone.

We knew it was coming, but it still hurts. I know she’s in a better place, but I can’t help but miss her. So, so much.

Even after my parents intervened, and later when my younger siblings took all the attention; one look from her was all I needed to know that she still saw me. She knew who I was. She could cheer me up and make me laugh quicker than anyone. Her slyest of grins, and her wryest of humors.

Now the only witty remarks I receive are from nihilists on the internet.



Those first eight years with her still means so much to me. The times in her garden. I doubt I was much help, but we would spend hours pulling weeds and looking at the bugs crawling around in the dirt. Maybe you think your grandma has a green thumb, but hers was on a whole other level. She could grow tropical fruit in her backyard right next to cacti.

Now I haven’t touched a plant in years. I spend my free time watching other people do things.



Sometimes I can’t remember what her house smelled like. Sometimes I can barely hear her cackling laugh. Sometimes I forget what her hugs felt like.

Now I only feel hugs through computer screens.



\------------------------------



They took a different route home from work today. They’ll do this every so often, though I have no way to clarify the reason. I like to think that they get bored by taking the same trip every day; that they need to explore new locations every once in a while.

That’s beside the point though, what really matters is the neighborhood they rode through. A few blocks in I start to feel a sense of déjà vu. I’ve never been particularly good at remembering locations, but the longer I watched memories began scratching the back of my brain. Young memories; the kind I’ve been thinking of a lot recently. It wasn’t until they passed a particular house that it became fully clear to me; it was a house I had been to many times, even if not for many years.

It was my grandma’s house.

The snowball bushes along the sidewalk were always her favorite.



As shocking as it is to see her place after all that time, it’s even more shocking how it shatters my beliefs about the website. My grandmother lives only on the other side of town; surely I would know if there was an elaborate web series being filmed at a coffee shop so nearby.

No, the only way this could be possible is if the subjects of these videos are completely unaware of the recordings being made, right?



It’s only a matter of time before the car shows up isn’t it? Now I’m deeply concerned for the safety of this person.



Please, car. Please don’t show up.



I want so desperately to do something to help.

I should’ve been paying attention to how they got home after they passed my grandma’s house. I let the shock of the situation distract me from solving the issue at hand. I have no idea how many turns they took, how many blocks they rode by, how long they traveled for. 



Knowing where they work isn’t helpful either. The chain that they work at is on every block in the city. If I were to look around at every installment it could take weeks to find the right one, and there’s no guarantee that the company would even tell me if she works there. And then, if I were to find her, what then? I don’t know anything about the people in these cars, the likelihood of me being able to do anything to stop them is astronomically low.



This sucks.

I feel so useless.

1o137or,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1o137or/help_needed_3_weeks_post_gdm_diagnosis/,Help needed! 3 weeks post GDM diagnosis,"Hello! I randomly stumbled upon a post and realized I clearly have this all wrong, but at the same time, I don’t think the Dr’s office has been very helpful in actually guiding me on what I should be doing.

I failed my 1-hour glucose test, so I had to do the 3-hour test. I failed at the 1-hour mark, was in perfect numbers at 2 hours, and barely failed at the 3rd hour.

I had a Zoom meeting with a doctor who’s also the hospital’s dietitian (and a type 1 diabetic) and with the nurse practitioner I’m supposed to meet with weekly for my diagnosis.

After that meeting, I received my glucometer and a bunch of restrictions and was on my way with the directions I was given. I struggled a bit because I went from eating 2 meals plus random snacks throughout the day to suddenly eating 3 timed meals and 3 snacks. It was hard for me to adjust. I also take thyroid medication, and my bottle says I have to wait 2 hours to eat afterward. And, I had to measure my levels before 8 a.m. daily. I was struggling with sleep, constantly exhausted, and just overall found the first week tremendously difficult.

Despite all of that, when I measured 2-hrs after every meal my numbers were within range, so when I met with the nurse practitioner, she suggested I add more carbs but continue doing what I was doing. She also mentioned that because my numbers looked good, I didn’t need to prick 6x a day. She said when I met with the doctor the following week, he’d likely change to 2x a day but until then continue with 6x a day.

I kept it up but started adding cheat meals, mainly because it was baby shower weekend, and we had a ton of guests, prep, and chaos. I was famished and just ended up consuming whatever was around. Thankfully, my numbers were still within range, and I never fully splurged until the day before the baby shower event and the day of the baby shower itself.

During these two weeks, I had experienced a “crash,” similar to how I felt 1.5 hours into my 3-hour glucose test. However, at the 2-hour mark, my numbers were still within range.

On the day of the baby shower, I had dessert during the event and Pizza Hut for dinner. I crashed during both meals, but since my numbers still looked good, I didn’t think much of it. I’m not sure if it was a true crash or if I was just exhausted from the weekend because I slept 4-5 hours for the past few nights leading up to the baby shower. I showed my meals and glucose numbers to my OB, and he was fine with the numbers—he didn’t mention anything about my cheat meals. He just told me to measure 2x a day and left it at that. He just glanced at it and didn’t really go through it with me which felt strange.

Last night, I had another cheat meal for dinner (chips, salsa, queso, and black bean enchiladas), then a snack afterward (whole grain Goldfish and a cup of decaf coffee with no sugar and Fairlife milk). This morning/afternoon my reading was 74. I decided it was finally a good day to have a strawberry cupcake I’d been craving for 3 weeks (sadly, it wasn’t good). A couple of minutes after eating it, I noticed my heart rate felt elevated, but I didn’t have a crash 1.5 hours into my 2-hr timer. And my 2-hr reading was still within range.

Tonight, I came across a post talking about overnight numbers getting too low being dangerous. I was never told this, and I couldn’t get a prescription for an arm monitor, so I have no idea how to track this. I also didn’t think much of the crashes I experienced until I read on Reddit how bad they can be for GDM.

Anyway, I need help. I feel like I need to unlearn everything and start from scratch because it doesn’t seem like what I’m doing is good for me or the baby. I honestly have no idea how to navigate all of this. Should I be measuring 1-hour after my meals instead of 2? Do I continue giving into my cravings if my numbers are still within range? I’m just so, so confused about everything. I don’t see my doctor for 2 more weeks and no plans of seeing the nurse practitioner. 

Also, I read about the Stelo arm monitor not being accurate and my drs office doesn’t want to write me a prescription for the Dexcom 7 because I’m now checking 2x a day. ",1,1759905608.0,GestationalDiabetes,0,1.0,False
1o137oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChair/comments/1o137oi/how_do_i_protect_fabric_chairs_from_spills/,How do I protect fabric chairs from spills?,"This is one of those topics I get asked about constantly—especially by people who’ve just invested in nice upholstered dining chairs or a new sofa and are already picturing the first coffee spill. Protecting fabric furniture isn’t just about one “hack” — it’s about layering prevention, protection, and maintenance in a smart, realistic way.

Let me break it down from the perspective of someone who’s worked with fabric treatments, furniture restoration, and home design over the years.

**1. Start with a quality fabric protector (the right kind matters)**

Most people reach for Scotchgard and call it a day. It’s not bad—but there are better, longer-lasting options depending on the fabric type. Professional-grade protectors like *Guardsman Fabric Defense*, *FiberSeal*, or *3M Scotchgard Professional* offer more consistent coverage and deeper fiber penetration.

Here’s what actually happens: these products coat the fibers with a microscopic barrier that resists water and oil-based stains. Liquids bead up instead of soaking in, giving you time to blot them away. The key, though, is *proper application*. Most people make these mistakes:

* They spray too close, oversaturating the fabric.
* They don’t let it cure long enough (usually needs 12–24 hours).
* They skip the second coat (which doubles protection).

If you want serious spill protection, two light coats, applied evenly and left to cure, make all the difference. And yes—reapply every 6–12 months, especially on high-use chairs.

**2. Consider slipcovers or removable, washable covers (especially for dining areas)**

If your chairs get a lot of daily use, practicality wins over aesthetics. I recommend ordering custom-fit slipcovers from Etsy or companies like Comfort Works or Bemz. They can look surprisingly polished and allow you to throw them in the wash after a spill instead of panicking with a towel and a prayer.

Even if you don’t want full slipcovers, seat protectors or “chair pads” made of washable performance fabrics like Sunbrella or Crypton are a game changer. These are the same materials used in hotels and restaurants—they repel stains like nothing else.

**3. Prevention by placement and behavior (sounds boring, but it works)**

If your chairs are in a dining setting, choose washable placemats and make “coasters mandatory” a habit. For families with kids or pets, darker, textured fabrics (think tweed, heathered linen, or polyester blends) hide small accidents better than solid light colors.

Also, don’t underestimate how much *routine care* extends lifespan. Vacuuming fabric chairs weekly removes dust and grit that grind into fibers and weaken them over time. That’s one of the main reasons older furniture starts to look dull or unevenly stained—it’s not just spills, it’s friction and dirt.

**4. Emergency protocol for spills (timing is everything)**

When a spill happens, your reaction time determines the outcome.

* **Blot, don’t rub.** Rubbing forces the liquid deeper.
* Use a clean white towel or paper towel to lift as much as possible.
* Then, use a mild cleaning mix: a teaspoon of dish soap with a cup of warm water works for most water-based stains.
* For oil-based stains (like salad dressing), use a drop of rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and test a hidden area first.

If the spill’s large or on a natural fabric like linen or wool, call a professional cleaner as soon as possible—home attempts can set the stain if the fabric’s untreated.

**5. Optional: upgrade to performance fabric if you’re still shopping**

If you haven’t bought the chairs yet, this is the easiest long-term solution. “Performance fabrics” like Crypton, Revolution, or Sunbrella are engineered for stain and moisture resistance from the fiber up, not just sprayed on top. They’re used in hotels and hospitals for a reason.

I’ve seen white Crypton chairs shrug off red wine like it’s water. They’re more expensive, yes—but you’ll never regret the upgrade if you live with kids, pets, or coffee.

**TL;DR:**

* Use a professional-grade fabric protector (2 coats, cure fully, reapply yearly).
* Add washable covers or pads for high-use areas.
* Keep a quick-clean kit nearby for immediate spills.
* Vacuum regularly to prevent abrasion wear.
* If shopping new, invest in performance fabric—it’s worth every penny.

It’s one of those “ounce of prevention” things. The people who take 30 minutes to do proper protection up front are the ones who, years later, still have furniture that looks like new—while everyone else is Googling “how to get coffee out of linen.”",1,1759905607.0,ComfyChair,0,1.0,False

CHAPTER I: BOOTS

They say that there would be no discharge in the war.

Fluorescent tubes leaked light I likened to urine, dripping from their bulbs like soft candle wax crackling under peroxide flames. Cubicles were rowed each to each, stacked upon another—an unending cascade of monotony and labour. Finding myself here, all I could care about was the noise. The buzzing of said lights paired with the endless ticking of the analog clock could never fail to distract me from my supposed work.

Not aware of it yet, I would soon be free from this nauseating shift; for the clock struck thirteen, and we were all dismissed.

Greeting coworkers with the familiar apathy I gave every time they tried to interact with me, I shrank myself from them once more and escaped to the elevator in solitude. While the elevator descended, I tried to think in-between the obnoxious beeps it made and the cramped space I was allocated with. The scent of sweat was a smell I had to swallow, surrounded by damp animate suits. Five or six people were inside, of course all strangers to me—for I don’t recall having any other connection in this work. The perspiration from the claustrophobic conditions of the elevator dried as I stepped out into the cold breeze of night.

Clocking out, something twitched, a smile was felt disturbing my cheeks while I let the view seep into me. The silky skylines of the silt city I call home stopped me dead in my tracks. The spotlights and sirens let me submerge myself in them; their sounds and their glare proved an escape; and the serenity I felt somewhat surpassed the Sulphur in my soul. I wandered as a cloud does in a thunderstorm: aimless, with the updraft of my mind leaving my legs to carry me me into a café I haunt nightly, as if unwilling to let my brain protest. Staring off to my only love, I watched the city’s lights, the skyline buzzing with muted colours. I observed the reflections of the pond, and I smiled once more, this time with intent. A fire brewed within me as I gazed, coffee kissing my lips secreting an aroma only found in the city, rising in burnt coils like incense for the insomnolent. Insomnia is not a curse, for without it I would be unable to drink coffee this late. No, nothing can be summed up to curses or blessings. There is no virtue or vice in this life… Maybe with the exception of this view.

I’m in the office again.

They say not to look back at what’s in front of you. The same fluorescent yellow lights. The same obnoxious buzz. The same ticking of the clock. The same faces. The same cubicles that smell of stale Teflon. The same people. The same life. The same death. The same thing—all over again.

I have come to know them all.

Yet suddenly, I find that something rippled the puddle I’d spent years filling with blood, bit by sterile bit.

By the water cooler I found it—the disturbance.

Those two pale azure moonstones, shimmering like knives of lapis and lenoleum. 

It was you…

And so,

we met.

CHAPTER II: SALT AND SUGAR

I don't believe in luck.

it's been a while since I landed myself an office job like this. Mundane. Stale. Boring. Three words you could (hopefully!) never use to describe me.

It's my first day here. Everything seems weirdly robotic... The people, the things, hell even just that creepy old brass grandfather clock with that pendulum that swings with tachycardia, they're all just really, really weird.

Take for example those lights over there. I recognize that model. They're way too bright for being so yellow. And what's with that buzzing? Genuienly sounds like bees.

This place gives me the creeps.

Then there's the guy in glasses…

By the water cooler, and locking eyes, we exchanged a brief dialogue, not with words—of course not—but with the intensity of our glares. Gazing at eachother didn’t take long, maybe ten seconds at most. But it was like he was searching for something in me, like reading a book that just so happened to print onto my cornea. He wasn't searching for a page though, his gaze was clearer than that, he was looking for a line, hell maybe even just a word, but all I truly knew was that he found the book, and the chapter was me.

I need to get my mind off things like this.

I pretended not to notice afterwards, like most things I see. I tend to notice a lot of things I really can't afford to. Like, take for example that seemingly innocent wife.
 From the outside, picturesque; perfect husband, perfect wife, perfect life, right? 
Wrong. 
The husband's abusive and the wifest a whore. 
How do I know you ask? Why?
Because people don't notice those bruises on her, or her guarded phone habits. People don't notice that specific brand of perfume or that sadness in her eyes. People don't notice those frantic calls, those missing patches of hair. People don't notice self harm scars until it lets them score bonus empathy points. People don't notice the concealer so why would the notice what's concealed? People don't notice the things that are hard to un-notice. Because people never notice—except me. And it's infinitely fucking stupid to suppose otherwise.
Phew.
Sorry. Had to let that out.
Anyways, did I mention how I figured all of that out in the intro seminar? Yeah, I'm a brag and a potty-mouth. Not much bride material eh? Well, I suppose many people would disagree with that. They'd be disappointed too though.
I see through things well. Too well...
Maybe that's why he was staring at me.


But why did I stare back?

...

Well in any case I hope I don’t have anything to do with that guy.




So like… You know how I said I don’t believe in luck? Can I at least believe I’m unlucky?

Sigh…

My cubicle is right next to his!

Eugh. Everything's off. The smell, the sound, the sight, the damn ticking! Ugh, still slightly sentient I started my shift seriously, supposing I should kick off with a bang, you know, soar like Icarus and all that. But I couldn't. The sight of him kept distracting me, and it seemed he was distracted too—not by me however, but his thoughts. It was like he was stuck in a box of his own making, of his own mind. I wonder what's in those few cubic centimetres inside his skull...
Eugh. He's starting to rub off on me.
Time flew, faster this time, and the clock struck... Thirteen? Wait huh? 
Oh, he's leaving. I guess that's my cue to leave too.

The elevator stank. It was weirdly damp and always overcrowded but atleast the ticking was gone. Brushing against like half a dozen people inside the elevator I finished my first shift! I wanted to celebrate. There was a warm fuzziness in me and it seemed to want booze, so I went, satisfied with my work. The people here don't talk much though. I guess I'm drinking alone.



Only the most stubborn of stars are peaking out from the sky right now—muffled by pollution both of light and of cloud. It seems kind of ironic to see even Polaris gone. Oh well...
I'm new around here, so finding a good bar will be hell. Searching around, there's nothing. Empty streets, closed shops, neon signs that blink off and on like neurons. That spray painted asphalt seems to be the only dash of colour in this goddamn city. It's like every single bar in the vicinity seems to be hiding from me! I just want beer. Not a salon. Not a 24/7 grocery shop. A bar. That's it. Beer. I doubt I need a new mattress! 
Sigh.

This city is bleak.

It's too quiet. And when it's not quiet it's usually because of those obnoxious sirens. It's too dark. And when it's not it's usually too bright. Do you get my gist?
I've been walking for hours. It's hypnotizing though, I'll give you that. This city seems like it can ensnare a person, trap them in it's web. I hope I don't turn into it's fly though.

Hmmm... Oh!
There seems to be a nice café nearby. It's odd, why is coffee being sold at midnight yet beer isn't? 

Well, guess I have no other options.

This café is a dark one. The coffee smell jolts you awake, like a gentle punch to your central nervous system. Immediately you get hit with that pristine polished dark pine you'd expect in proper places, beautifully brought to life by better bulbs than the office. It's like Maplewood and marble combined. Kinda eerie though... This place is too elegant for a simple coffee shop. There's a balcony too. Woah that views aweso—

—Wait... Is that?

...

Looking into getting my first gaming computer tower.,"Hi I’m a 30 year old gamer who has been a console gamer for 25 years that is looking into getting a gaming pc right now but I’m having trouble finding a pre built that would fit my budget and needs. I am not comfortable with building my own due to being autistic and having mild shaky hands so it would have to be pre built only. My budget is no more then $2000 and I will be hooking the pc up to my HD non 4k tv to save money on a monitor, desk, chair, etc since I’ll be able to use it sitting on my couch with a coffee table that has a top that can be pulled towards you. I have a keyboard and mouse already but will mostly be using a controller for games since i play a lot of fps games like CoD, Borderlands, Battlefield, etc. I will only be using it for gaming and photo editing/digital art if anyone could help me with giving me recommendations to where to get a high end pc for my budget I would greatly appreciate it thank you in advance!

We have a ton in common, so I asked her out for coffee.

When she showed up, I was hyped. She looked even better in person. I mean she has great style, confident, super chill vibe. But the second she got close to say hi, the smell hit me like a wall. I don’t even know how to describe it. It was so strong I literally had to take a step back.

I tried to act normal, but the whole time I was dying inside. THANK GOD! We sat outside, because I was doing everything I could to keep a bit of distance. She was genuinely sweet though, and our convo flowed easily. I felt awful because everything else about her was perfect… except that smell.

I ended up making up some excuse to leave early, and now she’s texted asking if I want to hang out again this weekend.

Part of me feels bad, maybe she just had an off day or something, but I don’t know if I can go through that again. Am I being too harsh here, or would that be a dealbreaker for you too?

I didn't sleep.
Or maybe I did, the way you trip and wake up before you hit the ground.

The city never stops. Trains humming under the floor. Someone's TV droning through the thin wall. My jacket sitting on the chair like a dog that knows it's done something wrong.

When the light finally came, it was colorless. Flat. Winter sky like paper left in dirty water.

My phone lay face down beside me, screen cracked from when I threw it last night. Notifications stacked like trash bags at the edge of a street no one cleans.

Fraud.
Privileged brat.
Nepo kid idol caught lying.

The last one stung. Not because it was new. It stung because it had my face next to it.
Except it wasn't my face.

I opened a thread.
Someone had posted a screenshot of a blog white background, harsh black serif text:

Commercialism is rot. To perform for profit is to sell your soul to the machine. Amateur work is the only pure work. Professionalism is a trap.

And under it, my name. Rin Watanabe. Bold. Public.

She the other me had been writing essays. Using my name.
Using my face to spit on everything I'd bled for.

I scrolled down. Photos of me at sixteen. At twelve.
My old street before debut. My high school uniform.
Images no one should have unless they'd been inside my life, inside my skin.

It felt like someone had gutted me and pinned the pieces on a bulletin board.

My hands shook.
I dropped the phone. Sat very still.
Breathing shallow, like moving too much would let her see me through the walls.

The thought came sharp and hot: who the fuck is this impostor?

I needed to move. Sitting still made me a target.
I threw on the jacket. My jacket.
Scarf. Sunglasses. Mask. The uniform of someone too recognizable to be recognized.
It never works, but it makes me feel like I'm not prey.

Outside, Ikebukuro tasted different at eight a.m.-stale bread from bakeries opening, exhaust from scooters, faint incense drifting from a temple down the alley. The air stung my nose, turned my breath white.

I didn't know where I was going until my feet stopped.
A coworking café near the station.
Wood tables. Outlets everywhere.
I ordered tea and sat with my back to the window, laptop glowing like a spotlight on a suspect.

Search: Rin Watanabe blog.

And there it was.

The Impostor Journal.

Weeks of posts under my name.
Titles like Against Commercial Idols, How Nepotism Destroys Talent, The Idol Factory and Its Products.
Each one with my stage photo me smiling like an idiot next to words about how my entire career was fake.

She was dragging me to hell with a smirk I'd perfected myself.

I clicked About.
One line stared back:

I'm Rin Watanabe. This is the truth you weren't supposed to know.

My pulse jumped so hard it hurt.

I read anyway.
Each word was a needle.

She wrote about idols like we were mannequins on a conveyor belt.
How fans were sheep buying ""prepackaged voices.""
How someone like me a ""nepo baby"" born behind the velvet ropes stole dreams from girls like her.

Somewhere between rage and nausea, my body started shaking.

I opened a blank note on my phone.
Typed: This isn't me. I'm not her.
Deleted it.
Typed again: Fake. Liar. I'll prove it.
Deleted it again.

The words all felt like chewing tinfoil.

A tap on my shoulder.

I almost screamed.

It was Kana hoodie up, mask on, eyes red like she hadn't slept either.

""Rin, you can't just sit here,"" she hissed. ""Agency's losing it. They want you to post a statement.""

I laughed, too sharp, like glass breaking.
""What kind of statement? 'Hey everyone, I'm not me?'""

Kana's gaze dropped to my laptop. ""She's escalated, huh?""

""She's writing essays now,"" I snapped. ""Under my name. Calling me a spoiled little factory product.""

Kana didn't even flinch. ""People believe her?""

""Of course they do. Why wouldn't they? She has my face. My voice online. My life.""

Kana tugged my arm. ""We can't stay here. Come on.""

We ended up in a karaoke booth three floors above a drugstore.
Neon lights blinking. Vinyl seats sticky with last night's cola.
Kana locked the door, turned on the screen, but no music played.

""Feels like a crime scene,"" I muttered. My own voice didn't sound like mine.

Kana crouched low, whispering. ""She's doing amateur journalism about you.""

I barked out a laugh that wasn't funny. ""Amateur journalism? She's murdering my career, Kana.""

Kana's eyes were flat. ""Maybe she thinks she's proving something.""

""What, that she's more authentic than me? That she's some kind of anti-idol rebel?""

""Maybe."" A pause. ""Or maybe she's just jealous.""

""She has my fucking jacket,"" I spat.

Kana didn't answer.

The screen flickered.
Instead of lyrics, black text scrolled across a stock image of a mountain.

Don't be mad. I'm just making you interesting.

I froze.
My skin went hot and cold at once.

""Kana,"" I whispered. ""Look.""

The line dissolved. New text appeared:

Check your locker at Studio B.

Kana's face drained of color. ""She's in the system.""

My breath stuttered. ""She hacked everything. My socials. My files. My whole damn life.""

""We need to call security.""

""No."" My voice snapped like a whip. ""If I don't go, she wins.""

The train ride to Studio B felt like being hunted.
Every stop an eternity.
Every reflection in the glass a stranger wearing my face.

The studio's back hall smelled of dust, hairspray, and the ghosts of other girls' dreams.
My locker sat at the very end.
Paint chipped. Sticker half-peeled.

I opened it slowly.

Inside: a plain manila folder.

I pulled it out with trembling hands.

Photos spilled across the floor.
Me at twelve, eyes too wide.
Me at my first audition, shaking so hard I forgot the second verse.
Me at the hospital, holding my father's hand the day before he died.

Private moments.
Things that were mine.
Things no one else should ever see.

On top of the pile: a handwritten note.

You don't know me yet.
But I know you.
Amateurism is practice for the real thing.
This is my practice.
You are my practice.

- R

My throat locked.
The paper smelled faintly of coffee and cigarettes the same smell as that first photo.

I wanted to burn it.
I wanted to scream.
Instead, I knelt there, shaking, wondering if maybe this was what it felt like to be erased in real time.

The idol me.
The girl me.
The ghost the internet wanted to kill.
All splitting apart.

A memory slammed into me like a punch.

My father's voice, rough from years of dancing on ruined knees:
""Rin, nothing's yours unless you fight for it.""

He'd been a legend once.
A performer who could pull tears from a crowd just by standing under the lights.
He built a dance empire from nothing, fought off rivals like a warlord with sequins instead of swords.
When the rebel crews rose up, he crushed them. Built alliances.
A general in the battlefield of applause.

My mother she was different.
Soft where he was iron.
The kind of idol who made fans believe she was their best friend, their sister, their first love.
People wept when she graduated from the stage.
She taught me how to bow properly.
How to smile like I meant it, even when my stomach hurt from hunger and nerves.

The fans called me ""nepo kid"" before I ever stood on a stage.
Like my blood was a privilege instead of a weight tied to my ankles.

They didn't see the nights I spent locked in rehearsal rooms, crying until my throat was raw.
They didn't see how many times I lost.
Lost auditions.
Lost parts.
Lost friends who couldn't handle the competition.

All they saw was a shiny product stamped Watanabe™.

The impostor's note burned against my palm.

""You are my practice.""

Practice for what?
To replace me?
To destroy me?
To prove she's more ""real"" than I ever was?

Who the fuck was this girl?

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

Unknown number.

Enjoy the archive?

My fingers moved before my brain caught up.

Who are you?

Three dots appeared.
Then:

You, but better.

The world tilted.
The locker room spun.
For the first time, I wasn't sure if she was pretending to be me or if she actually believed it.

Kana found me on the floor, clutching the folder like a lifeline.
""Rin, we have to go,"" she whispered. ""Agency's calling the police. This is serious.""

I stood, knees shaking.
""No,"" I said. My voice didn't sound like mine anymore.
""I'm finding her first.""

Because if I didn't...
Maybe I'd disappear.
And she'd be the only Rin left.

1o130nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1o130nx/thenespressoaffect/,#TheNespressoAffect,"I’m curious to know as a coffee lover what everyone’s opinion is on the downturn in foot traffic at SB’s. It hasn’t been discussed elsewhere and while SB’s and Nes Press are two different markets I really feel that the expansion of the brand in retailers has been a life change for many. For me as I’m sure it was for many others, it was love at first capsule. Lol. Almost as if you were going through the motions of a comfortable and familiar LTR that was good and moderately satisfying. One you never thought you would leave, then BAAM, your dream person comes along and has you questioning everything you ever knew. 

It’s really an entire shift in your life when you get one of these little machines. I can’t explain it. Sure daily coffee in-store can be pricey for many. But aside from that there’s so much comfort and pride in the set ups. The recipes, the little cups. The foam 😍

I do still adore the quaint and cute coffee shop culture and getting things done in a little cafe. But the joy I feel from my little machine is unmatched. Lol

Do you think the discovery of Nes Press by more people is affecting sales at SB’s more than what is being stated?

1o12zsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoraAi/comments/1o12zsh/sora_2_prompt_playbook_how_to_create_viralready/,SORA 2 PROMPT PLAYBOOK How to Create Viral-Ready Videos That Sell - With Zero Editing Required,"Hey, I shared these prompts on X and they seem to be getting a lot of attention.  
Thought I'd share here as well as it might be valuable for you guys!  
  
*(Built for SaaS founders, content creators, and UGC marketers) by* [*simonasdip*](https://x.com/SimonasDip)

# ⚠️ Why This Matters

Sora now limits you to **30 generations**, so you **can’t afford to waste prompts**. Every video must look organic, trend-ready, and product-focused - all from a single sentence (or less).

This playbook gives you **4 viral prompt styles** \- with proven examples, credited prompt writers, and bonus modifiers - to help you generate viral videos that **look human, promote your product, and require zero editing.**



# 🧠 How Sora Thinks

Sora was trained on millions of short-form videos - TikToks, Reels, Vlogs.

If your prompt *resembles* a real video format (like “What I eat in a day” or “a girl trying on hoodies”), Sora fills in the rest with realistic scenes, character expressions, transitions, and even captions or voiceovers.

But the better your prompt, the more control you get.

# 🎬 The 4 Prompt Styles (With Examples)

# ① Short-Form Natural Prompts

**(Fastest to Use - Least Consistent)** **Credit:** [**@david\_attisaas**](https://x.com/david_attisaas)

These are simple one-liners. Sora understands popular formats like vlogs, hauls, POVs, and food diaries - and fills in the rest.

**Examples:**

“What I eat in a day vlog of a Gen-Z woman in Bali” “Girl eating after gym and scanning food with a calorie-tracking app”

**Why it works:** Sora is trained on TikTok-style content and can output highly watchable, organic-feeling UGC - even from one sentence.

**Drawbacks:**

* Characters may change gender, race, or age
* Scene consistency varies between runs
* Little control over visuals  

✅ Good for fast ideation ⚠️ Bad for repeatable content or brand consistency



# ② Detailed UGC-Style Prompts

**(Most Reliable - Most Realistic)** **Credit:** [**@consumerxai**](https://x.com/consumerxai) Use this for **repeatable, brand-safe UGC content** with full control over lighting, lens, wardrobe, mood, and dialogue.

**Prompt Example:**

    Primary Target & Visuals  
    A 20-year-old blonde woman filming a casual TikTok in her cozy bedroom. Warm natural light, pastel walls, soft fairy lights blurred behind her. Expression reads genuine warmth and digital closeness.
    Format & Look  
    4K, 180° shutter, fine grain, crisp micro-contrast. Large-format digital look with restrained halation on skin highlights.
    Lens & Filtration  
    35mm spherical lens on handheld rig for slight organic motion. Black Pro-Mist 1/8 for softness, mild polarizer for balanced reflections.
    Grade & Palette

**Why it works:** You’re giving Sora a cinematic blueprint - so it behaves like a real director. This lets you control every variable while still getting realistic short-form content.

✅ Repeatable ✅ Highly controllable ✅ Ideal for founders who want *brand-safe UGC*

🧠 Pro Tip: Have ChatGPT generate these for you on demand.



# ③ Second-by-Second Prompts

**(Best for Dialogues, Skits, Reaction Memes)** **Credit:** [**@0xFramer**](https://x.com/0xFramer)

Use this format when you want full control over timing, shot types, and interaction between characters.

**Prompt Example:**

    Upload your reference image to Sora. Then paste this:
    [00:00-00:03] Man says in loser’s voice: “I tell people I’m single by choice”
    [00:03-00:05] Close-up shot of a girl, who says: “Oh, your choice?”
    [00:05-00:07] Close-up shot of a man, who says: “No, theirs!”
    [00:07-00:09] Over the shoulder shot - in front of a man - a girl who looks sorry for him
    [00:09-00:10] Close-up shot of a man - he starts crying

**Why it works:** You’re giving Sora timestamps, tone, camera angles, and scripted lines - so it can build a full narrative scene, not just a vibe.

✅ Excellent for meme content ✅ Great for branded character videos ⚠️ Can’t go longer than \~15s unless you’re on Sora Pro

🧠 Pro Tip: Use this format for relatable ""conversation"" TikToks or creator-style storytelling (like cut scenes, punchlines, or back-and-forth skits).



# ④ Sora Prompt Library Remix

**(Fastest for Inspiration - Low Originality)**

4. Modify it for your niche  

**Example:**

Original Prompt: “Bob Ross playing PUBG” Your remix: “Retired designer trying CalStudio AI to build his first startup MVP”

✅ Great for quick ideas ✅ Easy to remix ⚠️ Not optimized for branded, realistic UGC

🧠 Pro Tip: Use these as **starter prompts**, then pass to GPT to rewrite them with your product, tone, or target customer.

1o12w66,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1o12w66/help_kontex_giving_instruction_in_generation_phase/,"Help: kontex, giving instruction in generation phase","Hi everyone,

I’m experimenting with **Kontext**, and I’ve fallen in something that is not clear to me: when I feed it a wireframe-style base image (like a clean architectural line render) and promped something simple like *“make it photorealistic”*, it creates an incredibly coherent and detailed output — way better than anything I’ve managed with SDXL or ControlNet so far. 



[the base image, from rhinoceros modelling](https://preview.redd.it/pnae5ppjyttf1.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2bb61cea9ce069c0300bdf19618135641c4c172)



[the resulted image, on which I have no control \(colour, texture, materials, bacground\)](https://preview.redd.it/tkw6v3ptyttf1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=e730cabf2b70aaa81d5cb44a18bde01069f919cc)

The issue comes when I try to **add control over specific elements** on first generation (for example, apart for making it photorealistic, being able to decide in first place material, light, or color of a single zone or element).   
Right now, I am only able to change one element at the time, hoping it understand the image.

[In this case, it decided that the coffee table was a sofa too, then it changed it colours according to the sofa one](https://preview.redd.it/zibflwa0zttf1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce00b173c11145201b52cf7492af5cdea0f719b7)

If I start being more descriptive in the prompt, Kontext tends to **ignore the original image completely** and generates a *new composition* instead of refining the existing structure ( I recognise the style of flux txt2img).



So the question is:

**How can I keep the base composition (same geometry, same framing) but still direct Kontext on individual parts — without it regenerating the whole image?**



I’ve tried different by masking, and latent reference tricks, but none of them gave me reliable control on first image generation, is always having to mod element after element.   
On top of that, every time, no matter what, I have a subtle shifting of the image, even if the size is correctly set up.

Is there a node setup or prompting technique that helps **lock the structure** while allowing detailed control at generation time?  
Am I missing somtehing different?  
Thank you in advance!
