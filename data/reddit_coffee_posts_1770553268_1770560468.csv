Vienna coffee was basically coconut cream on top of Americano. Cocoa Madeleine was decent but I liked their Financier pastry the most, nothing beats that. 

Prices are slightly less than “⭐️bucks” and taste/quality way way above! Don’t know why anyone would go there when gems like these exist.

Few months later we reconnected and he came back talking about how much he loves me, missed me and regrets his past decision. While we were broken up I became interested in a guy but things didn’t move forward anywhere. When my ex reached out I fell for him again because he was a good boyfriend but I was still a bit unsure. A month into me and my ex being back my crush, 23M, reached out and became interested in m. Because I was unsure about trusting my ex again despite him not giving me a reason, I called things off with him and start talking to my crush. My ex kept reaching out confessing his love and even though my heart skipped a beat every time i saw him or saw his text pop up and he would talk and cry about how i am his person he saw me as his wife and leaving me was the biggest mistake of his life.I couldn’t get back with him because I was already dating my crush and he was a very respectful guy. As time passed I found that my relationship with my crush was more so about being respectful and nice rather me being loved the way I wanted to be loved. 2.5 years from our breakup I found out from mutuals that my ex had moved away and 3 months from then he reached out to me. Things between me and crush were not the greatest and we were heading towards taking a break. when my ex reached out I was ready to get back with him because I truly missed him so much but I found him to be a bit different than before. When he was visiting for holidays we met up for a quick coffee and ended up making out and talking about how much we love each other. things didn’t progress much and we would text or facetime occasionally. Until I found he was with someone through social media (him being a bit different around me when we met up made sense). I confronted him and he told how he had messed up reaching out to me but he couldn’t hold back because he thinks about me everyday and how it might be too late for us to get back together because him and his girlfriend had introduced each other to families and friends and he is now being pressured by her to get engaged soon, so its too late to get out of that relationship. What bugs me about this whole situation is that the night before he was talking about marrying me so passionately and the next day he mentioned being forced to get engaged. I did get back with my crush 2-3 months later because i felt so broken after I found that out and needed some support. He doesn’t know this happened and it also makes me sickk all the time to know that he is now engaged his fiancee doesn’t know how he truly feels about her.

So here's a long ass post to test my theory.

I'm Felix, no I'm not a bot, idk how convince you otherwise. I'm currently having a post-event crash-out of my ""final-final"" year of design school. After an extra 1.5 years of wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix on clinical anxiety and depression, and way too many sleepless nights, I finally at the finish line.

I'm here for dem random chaos of taking to people who lives a completely different life from across the globe. Where ever you're from, if you can ping-pong the convo we have and take serious things I seriously, we might be vibin.

I live for graphic design, but lately, I've been obsesed with the more ""analog"" stuff such as junk jurnaling and clay stamping. Basically anything that can get me  away from too much screen. I'm currently in the middle of binging Abbot Elementary, Bob's Burgers, nd Fionnna and cake. I'm updated on Genshin (yikes), WuWa, Brawl Star, and The Sims. If you have lore bomb about any of these, drop it on me. The vibe of me is INFP 5w4, looking for regular chats, bromance or just yappers. 

I've been in the trenches with clinical depression for a long time and its getting back to me again after awhile. Juggling final year with all this is tough but hey I did it. I've had some dark episodes recently, but I'm back on meds and focusing on healing now. I find escapism in hearing about people's mundane daily life, tell me what the weather is like or what you're currently hyperfixates on.

Wanna skip the small talks? DM me with ""Panda"" so I know you're a real person and not just a dead internet bot. Tell me your go-to coffee or tea or any drink order or the last game/movie you watched that actually made you feel something.

1qz9tkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/manchester/comments/1qz9tkn/really_dislike_living_in_warrington/,Really Dislike Living In Warrington,"I really don’t want to offend anyone but this is how I feel. 

I live in the town centre and I know there are lots of lovely areas in the suburbs like Stockton Heath (which still isn’t my vibe) and Lymm which is one of the most beautiful villages I’ve seen (wouldn’t want to live there as not much going on).

  
I moved here end of 2024 from South Manchester as couldn’t afford to live there anymore and I’ve lived in a few areas around there Over the years.

As soon as I moved here I felt a heaviness from how drab and grey it all is. Im used to warm customer service and strangers making conversation in coffee shops and parks etc but the people here barely make eye contact. Again, it’s the town centre so not much of a community feel with transient people coming and going for work/shopping etc. Everything is so uninspiring. Everyone dresses in black or grey and the architecture is just so drab And somewhat dystopian. 

It first hit me how much I hate it when summer hit last year. Every time I went outside (which I rarely do, only to go to the shops) I came back really worked up and distressed. There is absolutely no greenery! No trees, no flowers! Just endless concrete reflecting the blazing sun in your face. Like I said, I don’t go outside as there is nowhere to go. I don’t have a car and yes Warrington is well connected but I don’t fancy having to get on a bus or train ever day! I WFH and live alone and having some nice coffee shops or parks in walking distance would be amazing. Where I lived in South Manchester had lots of independent coffee shops and beautiful green spaces and I can’t believe I took them for granted.

I have been feeling like this for a long time and have no one to talk to about it With. I’ve tried to see if anyone else has experienced this with Warrington but can’t find anything. 

Does anyone know what I mean?

  
Also, the apartment building where I live is huge and there are so many dogs and there pee and poo everywhere (even indoors in corridors and stairs) and the carpets are getting more and more stained as time goes on. My flat is small but modern. It was fully furnished but the sofa is one of those uncomfortable structured boutique sofas and the bed is soooo uncomfortable too! Hard lumpy mattress. I have bought many toppers and try to make the best out of it. The hot water in my bathroom is intermittent and a few months ago I had a big drain fly infestation (so did many other flats) and I constantly have to cover the plugs with tin foil. And I worry it will happen again in the summer! There are good amenities like a free onsite gym (not big and always busy) and a place for coworking but people go and hang out there and it’s distracting. I’m in my 30s and it feels a bit too ‘university halls’ and I just want a grown up apartment where things work, not full of dogs and some nice scenery (trees, flowers etc). The bin areas were horrific during summer with fruit flies , I literally had to cover my nose and mouth when putting rubbish out. 

  
Some positives: I feel safe. There doesn’t seem to be any crazy characters knocking about as everyone is just subdued and keep to themselves. Close, walking distance to all the big shops. Affordable.

  
I am in a position to move back to South Manchester now. However, it will cost me £200-£300 more a month. But I think it will be worth it for a better quality of life? 

I know there will be people who will defend Warrington to the ground and be rude back to me. But there has to be someone out there who gets what I’m saying?

I prefer the kind that grow quietly. The ones that start with conversation, curiosity, and a sense of ease rather than expectations. That’s what I’m here for.

I’m someone who enjoys depth, but not heaviness. I like thoughtful conversations mixed with humor, teasing, and moments where you don’t feel the need to perform. I’m spiritual, not religious, drawn to philosophy, introspection, and understanding how people work beneath the surface.

I’m calm most of the time, with my own share of chaos tucked away neatly. I listen well, care deeply, and value honesty more than charm. I’m not into drama, games, or mixed signals. I appreciate warmth, emotional intelligence, and people who are kind without trying to prove it.

Life for me is about small comforts and quiet rituals. Strong coffee in the morning. The smell of it lingering. Dark chocolate. Simple food. Music that fits the mood. Nights that feel slower than the day. Sometimes an occasional joint to take the edge off and breathe.

I’m open minded about connection and relationships, including ENM or polyamory, as long as everything is honest, respectful, and clear. Above all, I value communication.

I’d like to meet a woman who enjoys conversation, presence, and letting things unfold naturally. No rush. No pressure. Just seeing if two people can feel at ease talking to each other.

Background info: my mother was an unstable drug addict and victim of familial sexual abuse, she died when I was 7 and placed me in the care of my grandmother, who then emotionally and physically abused me, sometimes as far as not letting me shower and refusing to feed me when I was sick as I would 'throw it up anyway' 

I have a friend who knows basic information about my upbringing; my mother dying of a drug overdose. I have referenced my mental health and issues with not being able to sustain relationships and jobs to which she seems to dismiss. She also negatively focuses on qualities about my personality: I dont like to wear stuff other people wear and I am quite unconventional as a person, which she struggles to understand as she is very much a person who does what other people do. She got married recently and even though the marriage is not working she seems smug, I asked her to hang out on valentine's day and instead of saying no she said 'I am spending it with my husband' like okay there's plenty of hours in a day we could've grabbed a coffee..

I really do value our friendship but I am terrified of telling her how I feel but to be honest I'm so fed up of feeling like not understood by her. I am not one for messaging all the time and she messaged me other day saying 'are you alive?' instead of just asking if I'm okay what I've been up to etc. I'm really struggling with my mental health at the moment and I want to be honest and say 'when you do this it makes me feel small' but to be honest I feel like I know how she is going to react and make out I can't take a joke or I am making something frivolous serious.

It might look quite long but I put a lot of thought behind it and I sectioned it into two parts which should be an easy read

**ABOUT ME**
I'm a uni student currently doing my second bachelor's in biomedicine (I currently have a bachelor in psychology). I'm average looking, brown hair blue/greyish eyes and slightly chubby but it's something I'm quite confidently working on. Politically I don't think I relate to a certain group but I vibe more with left-leaning open-minded people.

As a person I find myself quite laid-back, easy-going and flexible. Many people have told me that I'm a kind person (not only my mom), funny and mature. I might not talk much at the start and I'm not a very assertive person but if you really want to know me truly I think you should see for yourself, this is mostly the gist of me.

If Myers-Briggs interests you I'm a mix of INTP and INFP leaning more to the feelings perspective. My star sign is Gemini but I'm not very concerned about such things myself and my love language is physical touch and quality time. I'm a sucker for hugs and it will brighten my day tremendously!!!!

I'm very introverted spending most of my time happily at home indulging in my hobbies which are reading up on psychology and medicine, being tired and quite generically gaming. 

I do like reading books mostly non-fiction literature about tea, coffee, alcohol, botany and misc but I also really want to get into gothic, philosophy and specific classical literature. One book I'm very interested in getting at the moment is Wuthering Heights. 

I like watching TV and anime. For my taste I like Satoshi Kon, Studio Ghibli, Evangelion, and a recent movie that I saw was Josee, the Tiger and the Fish a romantic anime which I really adored. If you have any recommendations I would love to hear them since I'm quite open for different genres.

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR**
I'm looking for a girl +/-3 years from my age within a reasonable distance from Sweden, I do not mind long distance if we could make it work. I do not really seek a traditional heteronormative relationship but I do not mind certain gender norms that comes from it

If I remember correctly ""opposites attract"" has somewhat been debunked by science. I think it depends on what aspects we are looking at, I do think  (and from what science has said) having a common hobby, view or interest is important for a relationship so I would like something we could bond over. But I do believe certain personality quirks follow the notion of opposites attract. Soooo.. this is a really long way of saying I would like a yapper. 

I do not care for high intellect and I'm quite open for different personalities. I can love both a woman that is strong and tells the cashier that they got my order wrong but also someone who is more soft-spoken and shy that I would headpat and cheer on for doing a great job. This doesn't mean that I would fall for anyone though since I do still have preferences.

I'm not very concerned about looks, as long as you take care of yourself. I do have certain traits I find appealing but if I would fall in love with someone I would grow a physical attraction to them and love their features since it's a part of my woman 

Hope it didn't take too much of your time and I would love a response with who you are what you're seeking and if you have any thoughts about what I've written",1,1770559474.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1qz9p40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianBeautyTalks/comments/1qz9p40/rating_the_glosseslipcare_i_own/,Rating the glosses/lipcare i own,"Hello! I’d like to point out that I try to take great care and time to choose my lip products. My dermatologist has advised me against wearing makeup because my skin is very sensitive, so I try to be careful with my lip products because they’re the only kind of makeup I have. I apologise if the reviews are a bit biased, but they are based on how they have worked for me. 

What works for me may not work for you, and vice versa. 

Feel free to ask me about any questions regarding the products in the post, I’ll do my best to answer them.

None of what I’ve written is Ai, and i’ve been working on this since november. 

**1)** Victoria’s Secret flavoured gloss in the shade/flavour Apple Brûlée: The smell at first is nice and reminds me of apple crumble, but it gets too strong and makes my stomach feel queasy. It tastes okay but smells very sweet. 

I feel like the taste should be better, more apple-like perhaps, because isn’t that the point of a flavoured gloss?

The smell does dissipate after a while and it’s bearable. The gloss is nice and makes my lip soft, leaving a subtle pink tint behind. It is non sticky and comfortable to wear otherwise. I got it during a sale, so 599 with a platform fee, 622. 7.4/10

**2)** Foxtale Brightening lip Balm, in the shade Light Mauve Glaze: it’s a decent spf lip product. But I didn’t notice much lightening/brightening as it claims, as this is my 2nd purchase. Smells like caramel, tastes a bit sweet. 

This used to be my moisturising base before any lip product and it used to pill on my lips after sometime, along with whatever lip product I applied on top. I noticed this after I bought it the 2nd time. And even by itself it used to do the same thing. For that, I will give it a 7/10 

3) Lux Lip Oil in the shade Bengal: it’s moisturising, and it’s non sticky, that’s the good part. It leaves a neon pink tint after reapplying, which I don’t like. I got this a while back on a sale for 500, and it is 999 otherwise. There are better options out there, won’t be repurchasing. I would also like to tell you that Nykaa alters reviews. 6/10

4) Inde Wild, Og, Wedding Rose, Chai, caffeine addict, and glazed jalebi

Og DLT: it’s too thin for me, felt like rice water and had to apply it lots of times to maintain its thickness. Had a bitter after taste. If you’re looking for a thin lip mask, go for it. 7/10 

Wedding Rose: Leaves a neon pink tint. I thought it would be more darker, and not so—bright. Go for it if you don’t mind it. Not my kind of colour. Feels thicker than the OG, oddly enough. 6/10 

Chai: smells like Elichi. I don’t hate the smell, it can be quite unpleasant for those who do not like it, though. Colour payoff is better than i expected. I prefer this one over the other ones, which is surprising because I never go for browns.  8/10 

Caffeine addict: okay, I really like the scent of this one. It’s like mocha coffee at first then smells like coffee beans. It feels thicker than the other three. It’s also really dark, but is buildable through layers. A thin layer that dries down a bit looks alright on me. Could wear it at home too. Not the most flattering, but somehow I like it the most. 8/10

Glazed Jalebi: smells really sweet, I like it. Like an actual Indian sweet. It’s very sparkly. Works as a lip topper upon a lip stain i suppose. I wouldn’t wear it much, personally. 7.6/10

All the colour/scented variants feel more thicker than the OG

5) Tyspy Beauty Strawberry Cheesecake and Chocolate Fondant. 

Strawberry: One of my favourite scents out of all of them. I keep smelling it more than I apply it. It’s a nice pink, a little bright but sheer. Buildable payoff. The shine can go away after a few hours, but I think that’s most glosses and balms. 9/10 

Chocolate: this also smells pretty good, but I prefer the strawberry more. Brown glosses look odd on me but this wasn’t terrible, just strong, though it’s not a true brown. It’s buildable as well. It leaves a pink tint after. It feels nice enough on the lips, but I would rather try the caramel variant instead if I had to repurchase. 8/10 

6) Masaba Lip Gelato Guava Glitz, Raspberry Rose, and Passion Plum.

Guava glitz is my favourite shade. It’s my second purchase. This lip oil is decently pigmented, and it glides onto the lips nicely. It doesn’t dry down uncomfortably and I’ve bought my second bottle. The formulas are more or less the same, with no significant scents. 10/10

7) Kiro Creamfinity Lip Gloss Blushing Apricot 

This gloss didn’t feel like much of a gloss. It looks like a shiny liquid lipstick. I’m still trying to like it. The formulation is nice, and if you have pigmented lips then go for it. Pairs well with a decent lip liner, and I liked the colour I chose—though many opt for Cocoa Walnut. 6.6/10 

8) Laneige Sleeping Lip Mask Berry and Taro

I tried this brand years ago, another sleeping mask I don’t remember the name of. Due to budgeting issues I had to stop buying it, but I repurchased the mini one recently and I loved it. It’s perfect for me, and would be good for those with dry skin or who would want a thicker balm for their lips. It is thick, and moisturising. 8.5/10 

The taro one had more of a lavender tint, and faint grape scent—that smells like tapioca balls after application. While the berry has a more pink tint and smells like berries I guess. 8/10

9) Akind Take a Shine Lip Gloss, Love Note

Removing the applicator can be a bit tricky as the doe foot applicator is too big for the stopper, I have to move the bottle away from me to prevent any spilling, so be careful about that. 

It feels light, and it is non sticky. Leaves a bright stain on the lips. Dries down quickly. There’s nothing really special about it, unless you’re keen on the ingredients. Wouldn’t repurchase, gave it to my mom and it looks great on her. 7/10 

10) Elf Gloss Boss spf 25, Pink Me Girl

Minimum spf for our bodies should be at least 30. But I needed an spf gloss and well, something better than nothing. 

It is quite thick which was surprising for me, and can feel a bit heavy on the lips. If you’re not used to heavy products like me, it can take a while to get used to. It’s not really sticky, but yeah. Heavy. 

It has a nice faint coconut scent, which is nice. I usually don’t like the smell of coconuts, but this one isn’t so bad. I had to return this because the expiry was in March 2026. I’ll be repurchasing it after that month has passed. 

I like the shade I chose, and it’s only downside is that it can feel heavy, but I can bear it personally. 8.3/10 

11) Maybelline lifter gloss, petal 

My third purchase! I like this gloss a lot, but i believe there have been some changes to the formula. 

The first one that I got in 2024 would leak, and was very runny. I thought it was just how it was, or maybe it melted as I travelled with it every day.

The second one, that I currently have, is much different. It’s thicker, doesn’t leak, and feels like I’ve got something on. Just wanted to clarify, not sure if anyone else has noticed the difference. 

i’ve noticed that when the gloss is newly bought, it’s thicker. as time goes on, perhaps because of the heat, it becomes thinner. 

The gloss itself has a nice colour payoff, and tastes a bit sweet at first if you accidentally eat it. Tastes like nothing after a while. But the top does leak after a while as the stopper loses its grip. 8.6/10

12) Fae Peptide Non-Sticky Lip Gloss, in the shade Living 

I kept it in my bag as an “in case of emergency” gloss, and it just stopped coming out of the packaging. The product just wouldn’t come out no matter how much I squeezed it. It wasn’t dry, the product inside was liquid and it moved around. Bad experience, a waste of my money. 

The gloss itself was actually nice, after I cut it open with a pair of scissors. Have to apply a thick layer to get that shine and moisture. It’s quite nice, I just wish I had a better experience with the packaging. 4/10 

Edit: I purchased the Fae mini trio with the shades Living, giving, and some other white gloss I don’t remember. I liked the glosses a lot, and they’re hydrating. I’m happy with the packaging and the product too. They’re non sticky and give a good colour payoff, but some people can find them sheer. A much better experience, 8/10

13) Clinique Almost Lipstick, Black Honey 

I bought this a year ago, thinking it would look great on me. Well, it doesn’t look too good. Haven’t touched it in months. The formulation is balmy, and it’s honestly overhyped. Nivea blackberry could be compared with this—and at least that has a taste to it. 4/10 

14) Laneige Lip Glowly Balm, Gummy Bear

I personally like the smell of this. This smells like a hard grape candy. I don’t understand why people don’t like the glowly balm range, but it could be for the price. They feel like the sleeping masks in a tube. It’s a good option if you don’t want to dip your finger or a tool inside a tub. It’s a bit thinner than the sleeping masks, but feel just as comfortable. 

15) Chemist at Play, Chocolate Lip Jelly spf 50 PA+++ 

This smells like chocolate or something similar. doesn’t look odd on me. Does have a bitter taste if you consume, but best not to consume spf products. I needed an spf lip balm and this does the trick. But please be careful if you’re eating—remove the balm first then dig in. 8/10

16) Diam beauty Love Potion Lip Oil, Rose, and Funfetti

Okay. I love the scent of this one so much. Smells like a faint vanilla, or like something sweet. It’s thick and nourishing, and I personally really love it. I was debating on getting this for a long time and I just decided why not. I see a repurchase in the future. The colour does fade away after a while, but the oil remains, and I do wish it was a bit more pigmented. 9/10 

17) Derma Co, spf 30 Kojic acid lip balm 

When I first got this it was quite grainy, but it then became smooth. I assume that’s because of the weather or perhaps because it was stored in a cool room for a while. 

The balm itself doesn’t feel like anything on the lips, and wearing a lip mask over it is best before applying a lip product after removing the excess. I’ve only been using it for a week, so I don’t know how the lightening aspect of this lip balm works right now. 7/10 

18) Vaseline lip tin, Original

For people who want unscented, unflavoured products, this is a great choice. I was experiencing some small bumps on my lips and I thought it was because of the amount of lip products I use, and this healed and moisturised my lips. Made my lips smooth. Stays on for hours and can survive a meal too. 10/10

19) - \[ \] Vaseline Lip Care, Mellow Rose. 

the pigment does show up. i like the smell, its not like gourmand but its decent enough. it has a slight taste. the moisture level is 3/5. overall. i think for 3g of product the price should be less. 6/10

My favourite glosses/lip oils that I would repurchase and some that I have repurchased, in no particular order. 

• Masaba Lip Gelato, Guava Glitz 

• Diam Beauty Love Potion Lip Oil, Rose

• Typsy Beauty Pout Polish, Strawberry Cheesecake 

• Elf GlossBoss SPF 25, Pink Me Girl

• Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, gummy bear/berry

• Maybelline Lifter Gloss, Petal

• Vaseline lip tin OG

• And lastly, Fae beauty. This one is controversial for me, but I don’t mind trying it again as I did find the gloss enjoyable if the packaging wasn’t so ass. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me! For safety purposes, I won’t do swatches, but I will link the videos from YouTube or Instagram of what you want to see swatched. ",1,1770559355.0,IndianBeautyTalks,0,1.0,False

I feel like a bit of an outlier making this post but I'm someone who kinda really enjoys (enjoyed i guess :')) dailyscape. I had a 30-40 min routine that I enjoyed with my morning coffee every day, doing the daily tasks, jack of trades, mining sandstone, doing rune goldberg machine, & div locations etc. 

This very much wasn't about xp, gp, or progressing in the game. I've been playing this character since 08 & I'm pretty happy with where I'm at. I didn't even know until recently how op a lot of people find these things. I just liked having a repeated list of the same tasks that I could check off every morning before I had to go check things off my list irl.

I'm sad that my morning routine is being removed. It's brought me a lot of comfort and satisfaction over the years. That being said! There are clearly a lot of people who are happy with these changes & I don't think my player experience is more important than anyone else's. I'm all for any change that will genuinely improve the health of the game & I'm trying to be positive about continuing to play.

So.... if anyone else had a dailyscape routine that they did because they genuinely enjoyed it & not because of FOMO, what are you planning to replace it with moving forward? I know some people are saying ""make your own dailies"", but there's a reason we do the quests in the game rather than just making up our own. I'd like tasks that the game also recognises as complete.

I think I'll still base my routine around a herb run and player owned port. But beyond that I'm not sure what to do with my precious 30 minutes. Maybe a couple of clue scrolls or a slayer task. I don't really enjoy bossing.

Any ideas welcome! (sorry for the long post)",4,1770559326.0,runescape,4,0.75,False

I am a 37-year-old man.
She is a 48-year-old woman — married, with a child, intelligent, social, strong personality.
We never had a relationship.
We had moments.
Cycle 1 – The Attraction
She made the first contact.
She suggested the first meeting.
She sought my presence.
Our conversations were deep, calm, intelligent. There was no drama, no scenes, no jealousy.
There was strong chemistry.
The first romantic evening — the tension was tangible. Her gaze would change, she spoke more softly, she sought physical closeness.
I did not cross the boundary.
After that, she froze.
Cycle 2 – Peak and Freeze
Second romantic evening — even stronger charge.
Hotel.
Wine.
Silence in the elevator.
A look that said, “Do it.”
I opened her room door, said good night, and left.
After that — disappearance.
There were no accusations. No insults. Just withdrawal.
Later I understood — it wasn’t a lack of feelings. It was overwhelm.
Cycle 3 – Controlled Meetings
After the first disappearance, she began initiating more controlled formats:
Coffee.
Lunch.
Short meetings.
Daytime conversations.
During those meetings, there was no disappearance.
The disappearing only happened after a romantic evening.
That’s when I started seeing the pattern.
The Realization
At some point, I understood that my presence was activating something she could not regulate.
I wrote her a letter.
Not blaming.
Not pressuring.
Not rescuing.
I told her I would not cross the boundary because I didn’t want to hurt her or deepen her internal conflict.
She responded.
She admitted that I had seen beyond her barriers.
She admitted that she had to get herself out of the “wrong situation.”
She said the page was not closed.
That was her most conscious moment.
After the Letter – 8 Weeks of Observation
There was no direct contact.
There were:
Story reactions.
“Bridges.”
Symbolic posts.
Late-night activity.
Insomnia.
Opening the chat without writing.
During a случайна encounter — she froze.
She was prepared to see me. She parked next to me. She entered the venue.
She did not come to say hello.
That was not indifference.
It was blockage.
My State
At first, I had the impulse to write, to do something.
Then I realized:
What is logical here is illogical.
I had to become a rock.
Not open bridges.
Not react.
Not rescue.
Not explain.
With time, it became lighter.
I did not stop living.
Work, sports, friends, family — everything continued normally.
There was no obsession.
There was interest and observation.
What I Saw in Her
She is a strong person.
She is intelligent.
She is self-aware.
But when feelings become real — she freezes.
She is not running from me.
She is running from the intensity inside herself.
The more real it becomes, the stronger the fear becomes.
Where We Are Now
Nine weeks after the last peak.
No conflict.
No ending.
No beginning.
There is a pause.
I am not waiting.
I have given myself an internal deadline.
If there is action — it will come from her strength.
If there isn’t — I accept it.
The Most Important Thing
I did not lose her, because I never possessed her.
I was not betrayed.
I was not lied to.
I simply encountered a person fighting an internal battle that I cannot fight for her.
Conclusion
This was not a relationship.
They were moments.
Either something new will happen — on equal ground, without cycles.
Or it will remain a beautiful, unfinished experience.
I am ready for both outcomes.",1,1770559246.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m currently experiencing a ""unique"" gameplay feature in ZZZ v2.6 called **""Negative Optimization""**. My Intel Arc B580 (Battlemage) went from a smooth 80 FPS beast in v2.5 to a 20 FPS potato in v2.6. Why? Because some genius at Hoyoverse decided to remove the -use-d3d12 launch argument, forcing us into the prehistoric DX11 mines.

**My Rig:**

GPU: Intel Arc B580 (ReBar ENABLED, drivers fresh 32.0.101.8425).

CPU: Ryzen 5 3600X.

OS: Windows 11.

**The Comedy Gold:**

* GPU Chill Mode: My card is literally sleeping at 35% load during combat while the game struggles to hit 20 FPS. It’s like having a Ferrari but being forced to drive it in a swamp.
* Comparison (The Shaming): Even the brand-new Arknights: Endfield (which also runs on Unity) works like a dream on this hardware, giving me a stable 100 FPS. If a ""newborn"" game can do it, why can't ZZZ?
* Frame Times: I’m getting spikes up to 116ms. I can literally go make a coffee between frames.
* The Log Horror: My Player.log is a comedy of errors. Their XWeaponTrail system is throwing NullReferenceException every single frame.
* Engine Meltdown: I'm seeing UnityPlayer.dll Access Violations (0xc0000005) and the in-game browser is failing to initialize GPU acceleration.
* Cyberpunk 2077 Check: I get \~60-70 FPS on Ultra with RT in Night City, but ZZZ combat makes my PC want to commit Alt+F4.

**The Logic:** Hoyoverse, why kill DX12? It was the only thing keeping the draw call overhead from murdering our CPUs. Now the DX11 backend is just barfing on modern architectures.

If you’re on Intel Arc and feeling the pain, upvote this so the ""Small Indie Company"" might actually notice they broke the engine for an entire GPU architecture.

TL;DR: v2.6 removed DX12 support -> Unity DX11 backend is barfing on Battlemage -> 20 FPS slideshow gaming while *Endfield* runs at 100 FPS.

1qz9j3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/1qz9j3y/lil_chapter_88/,LIL Chapter 88,"“Over there is our gym. Well one of them at least. It’s filled with equipment for mundane workouts and is one of the ones better suited to your physique.” Scott informs me as we make our way down a path that leads away from the Darkholme Student Center. The building he is pointing to is a modern building with plenty of windows that people can look into or out of. From where we’re standing I can see various students and some faculty in the building doing various mundane workouts. 



Scott and I walk in comfortable silence for a while before he spots more features to show me. He gives me more rehearsed talking points as we move through the space. I glance at him and those glasses and I wonder how to best help the man.



The whole premise of Supervirgins is that it is a CYOA about building a super harem. It takes place in an odd reality where 14 supers of various moralities; Supergirl, Mystique, Starfire, Raven, Blackfire, Rogue, Shadowcat, the White and Red queens; Emma Frost and Jean Grey, the main heroines of My Hero Academia; Ochako Uraraka, Momo Yaoyorozu, and Tsuyu Asui, and the psychic sisters from One Punch Man; Fubuki and Tatsumaki, have never had meaningful and long-lasting romantic connections. Since I’m gonna kind of, sort of, take Scott Summers’ canon love interest from him so the least I can do is help him control his powers and thus allow him to take off his glasses.



14 canon love interests is a lot. I’ll be the first to admit that. I’m not 100% interested in every love interest here, but I do like the idea of having as many love interests as I can, and I certainly plan to interact with all 14 and let the cards play out as they may. 



Scott walks me to an apartment building and lets me know that it is an apartment style dorm. He walks me all the way to the front door. I open the door and immediately see a nice looking living room right next to a small but functional kitchen on the other side of it. I invite Scott in. He accepts my invite but tells me that the apartment is lacking all but the essentials. 



“Charles told me about it via telepathy on our way here.” He explains. I nod and invite him in anyway. We walk into the space together and internally I war between how to help Scott. 



I have a number of approaches I could take here. I could ask to heal him and possibly use my “Just give me one chance” perk’s usage for him to heal the injury that keeps him from controlling his powers. Alternatively I could give him an essence that shares my “Within Control” perk, one that doesn’t do other stuff like confer immortality or anything like that; an essence that is just to give him control over his vision. That’s probably the simplest route and I walk over to the kitchen as I decide to go for simplicity and speed over delicacy and stuff with a chance for failure. 



Scott chats with me as I use metacreativity to create a glass and position myself near my sink. I turn on the water and simultaneously create a weaker essence using my crafting system and essence alchemist perks. I don’t go crazy, I just pour an essence containing the “Within Control” perk into the cup. A clear liquid fills the cup I’m holding as I ask Scott if I can give him some water. When he says yes I smile and go and hand him the glass. He takes a sip and even from behind his glasses I can see his eyes widen in surprise. 



“I’m really thirsty.” He tells me, and I nod playfully at him before he downs the rest of the drink. When he finishes the drink he flashes me a smile. The leader of the X-Men tells me Charles is giving me access to the university’s basic resources while I’m here and he tells me that I have the equivalent of a student email, which will allow me to do stuff like use the library. His advice to me is to go and use that email and take advantage of the kindness Charles is showing me to get myself set up. I plan to take that advice.



Scott doesn’t spend long in the apartment but when he leaves there’s a bit of an eagerness to it that would lead someone less aware to think he didn’t like hanging out with me. I know why he’s eager to get out and I don’t blame him. I would be surprised if the next time I see him he’s wearing those glasses. When he’s gone I take his cup and I unmake it, causing it to become ether again. I also pull out my “Meet Cute” item, a small necklace, and fuse it with Bringsamen, which is itself already fused with a few other goods like the Amulet of Articulation and the Gauldur Amulet which is the form my “Lost Treasures” item from Skyrim took.



I am quiet and still as I look out at the living room. I don’t have much use for it but it gives me a view of the campus that I can quietly appreciate. 



I study the scenic view and take in the fact that I’ve effectively resolved the most pressing short term stuff: finding a place to live. This gives me a chance to sit down and soak in my new abilities and items. I pull one of my new toys out of my inventory; the Precursor Data Core. 



The object that materializes in my hands is a curious cube of metal. I look at it and smile as even just touching it allows me to feel memories of a time in the unthinkably distant past wherein cutting edge scientists of an ancient civilization built the relic. I peer at the lab the cube was constructed in and look at the ethereal humanoids who sat down and built the item. I admire their robotics and feel a surge of excitement race through my veins as I quietly absorb the item.



The cube shrinks as I begin to pull it into my soul. As the object becomes smaller, slowly and seamlessly entering my body, I feel the knowledge contained within begin the process of becoming a part of me, my intellect growing as I begin the process of internalizing the secrets within the piece of technology.



My new ability to absorb things, particularly things that aren’t meant to buff me as directly as an augmentation like a magical prosthetic or a cybernetic implant could, is a fun power. It is an especially fun power when I synergize it with Afarkaup Avarkostir, which gives me three copies of any and all of the items I get from this point on, thus allowing me to take an item, absorb it, and STILL have copies to play around with. And now I can do more than copy my items…



I look at the floor in front of me and reread the description for one of my new perks. For my best new perk. Simulacra. 



There are challenges that jumpers need to overcome. One of the trickier challenges that jumpers need to figure out how to deal with, unless they are fond of a specific type of drawback or they have alt-chain rules, is the challenge of doing everything they want to do within ten years. Ten years, in a lot of settings, actually isn’t that long. A cloning perk, even one that lets you create just a single clone and that never scales higher than that, is one of the better ways of overcoming that particular challenge. Simulacra is much better than a cloning perk that gives you a single clone and never scales higher. 



My clone, a perfect copy of me with all of my perks and the like, appears before me. As I look him in the eyes he looks me in the eyes. I take a deep breath and he mimics that. 



“I’ve been jumping for 73 years and I finally have you.” I tell the clone. Our minds are linked and as he studies me I can feel his excitement level mirroring mine. I’m in perfect control of the two of us, and so when I will him to shapeshift he immediately uses the Vixla trickster perk to become a bracelet which I pick up and put on my hand. It subtly adjusts itself to fit my arm perfectly and as it does I smile. 



I take off the bracelet and will the clone to shapeshift again, causing him to return to his natural form: our human body. I begin to adjust to the reality here even as I begin to think of the insane possibilities here. With enough clones I can outfit myself with equipment made of me, or I can protect any of my lovers and friends with my body. There’s also some secret synergies here as well…



Rett-Ligr applies to my clone as readily as it applies to me, and what’s nastier is that killing a clone doesn’t kill me. So long as I have a clone available somewhere even if it’s just somewhere inside of me and not active, even killing my original body doesn't actually kill me anymore. I need to train this ability up so that I have two full clones and thus can squirrel one away somewhere and keep it safe but now it is worlds harder to end my chain through violence or destruction. It takes just 3 days for a clone to regenerate from destruction, though during that time the clone is completely gone and inaccessible. 



This means that I can go visit settings with nasty instant-kill effects and so long as I don’t act like a complete dumbass I can be very safe. One setting that comes to mind is Harry Potter… Which makes me laugh since I completely eclipse Harry Potter in terms of power. It’d still be fun to go there and get some magical followers though. 



I look at my clone and communicate that it is to use my assorted ways of manipulating items, give them bodies, and then go full Ultimate Chad on them. By seducing our surprising array of items, particularly stuff like the daedric artifacts my clone and I can get a range of fun powers while also training all of our abilities. In the meantime I suppose I’ll go out and explore the world. My clone can turtle it up while I go out and interact with the setting which can help me overcome the annoying nerf that is New Game! 



My clone immediately conjures a copy of Brisingamen, as it seems that Afarkaup Avarkostir works even if I give an item away permanently, refreshing at the start of a new jump, and even as I slip out of the apartment I sense my clone going all desire entity. As the necklace becomes a doll I feel the love that dolls feel towards me surging into my veins and acting as a constant, perpetual source of empowerment via the buffed effects of Rett-Ligr. 



“Oh.” I remark as I close the door behind me. I can easily peer through my clone’s eyes and standing before him is a beautiful figure with white hair and a devious smile. She immediately does as the clone commands when he asks her to suck him off and I feel my own charisma increase as a result of the coupling. By the time I step out of the elevator I can physically feel the curious sensation of my muscles becoming stronger thanks to the way that Ultimate Chad allows me to use sex as a means to train and hone myself. 



I never thought much about the wild ways that training boosters and alternate methods of training would synergize with cloning perks. I am actively leveling up as I slip out of the building and enter the public parts of Superville. I’ve become a power-leveling gremlin and it feels incredible. 



I exit the housing unit and decide to go on a walk. More than anything else what I want to do is proc the encounters that lead to me meeting the various love interests that are canon in the source material for the Supervirgins jump, all of which have their own distinctive encounters with the protagonist and so far I’ve only met 1 of them: Supergirl. I make my way to a huge building situated on the far end of campus and as I do my clone continues to have a blast by embracing the Grand Adonis way of life. I decide to do some of the same thing and I use my pheromones though only a touch. My clone, meanwhile, is using them as powerfully as he can and is currently facefucking the doll-body of the necklace. 



I slip into the huge building and walk through various security scanners and other, more supernatural, protective measures before I enter a large room where a number of librarians sit behind a large counter and idly work on various things while students use computers. I can smell books and I know that this library is a university library so it blends both technology and good old-fashioned books to help a range of students and other patrons. It reminds me a bit of the main room of the Jackson Library Tower at UNCG. I explore the space before spotting an unused computer. I walk over to it and sit down, ready to become a techie geek. Signing in with the credentials Scott gave me is easy and in moments I’m online and surfing the web. 



I set up my email address properly, giving myself a real password and then begin to check out social media sites. It’s been a while since I’ve had cause to be active on social media and I definitely feel a bit rusty but I hurl myself into it with an almost impressive level of enthusiasm. I speedily fill out the digital forms needed to sign up for various websites, effortlessly memorizing which ones have apps I can download onto a phone whenever I go out and get one. 



“God I missed modern stuff.” I mutter to myself as I explore Reddit, a website I haven’t seen in decades. 



There’s a level of fun and convenience to modern stuff that causes me to feel a rush of dopamine as I scroll the web. It helps that I can passively sense the adrenaline and other feelings surging through my clone as he begins to summon other items and give them doll bodies. To his credit he wisely goes after the collection of wands, staffs, and rings I’ve collected first, which delights me as it results in me gaining abilities that are echoes of the powers possessed by my magical tools. My spooky ring, an item I’ve had from the very beginning of my journey, manifests as a pretty goth girl and it gives me the ability to collect pain and fire it at people, or use it to fuel abilities without expending mana or the universal sea of power coursing through my veins as a result of One Power. At the same time my clone scans stuff. He is an eager analyzer even in the throes of lust and the results of his labor fill me with power while I familiarize myself with popular websites native to this world. After a while I log off and realize that I need to go and get some of the more basic essentials out of the way.



I get up and leave the library and as I exit the building I touch my ID card in my inventory and I study the thing. In doing so I scan it and see a blueprint for the thing that fills my mind’s eye. At the same time one of my trains of thought takes my wealth items and fuses them with the ID which acts as a combination of a form of identification and several other things including a bank card. With this I can go ahead and permanently address some of the basic-level struggles about making a living in this world.



I use the map I integrated into myself earlier to locate stores that sell the basic electronics I will need in the days to come and I pay them visits. In a Best Buy I snag a cheap computer, a laptop, TV, and tablet, before going to a cellphone store and purchasing a phone from it, all of which cost three times less than they should and result in me getting three times as many goods. I use my own wealth to do this and I quietly wonder if I should go after some villains and use my ability to get money for beating people up as a means to enhance my wealth. As I start to make my way back to the student housing I have been given a space in I hear distant voices that get my mind racing.



“Friend Raven, let’s go get some sweets!” Says a voice, filled with the level of enthusiasm that only a sweet tooth could have. 



“Starfire, the other titans will want to hear how we did.” Replies another, much more monotone voice. I can hear flickers of emotion in it, including a level of content amusement. Raven doesn’t put up much of a fight and in moments the two members of the Teen Titans slip into a cafe not far from here. 



The voices aren’t coming from far away, and I decide to go ahead and have this early encounter. I walk to the cafe and enter it right as the titans finish ordering their food. The cafe is a cute place with a lot of style and the two titans are standing near a counter waiting for their food. I walk over to them and as I do Starfire, hearing me approach, turns to face me and when she does I can physically feel the wave of emotions that course through her. Starfire’s body and mind both react to my presence and proximity in vivid ways and her mind fills with powerful images that my nature as a mindreader allows me to see.



The tamaranean has a sharp imagination and the beautiful, slender redhead, imagines our bodies intertwining in precise detail. I remember the intense attraction I felt to Sif as I take a step back. Raven grabs her friend’s shoulder and this snaps the alien back to reality.



“Uhh hello! I apologize for startling you. Are you a telepath? How are you-” Starfire says, speaking fast and blushing as she studies me. I laugh and interrupt her. 



“I’m good. I’m a new arrival, a spontaneous arrival, and as such I’ve never been to this cafe before. I was just wondering what you’d recommend?” I ask, causing Raven to look at me more closely. As she does I can feel a similar, though much less intense, reaction from her. 



Raven is dressed in normal, though gothic clothes that cover her body and allow her to look cool and mysterious. Starfire is dressed in the clothes she’s usually shown wearing; a dark top that exposes her midriff and shorts of the same color and basic design. Both women seem to be in their very late teens or early twenties, meanwhile I look like I’m in my late twenties or extremely early thirties. 



Raven answers my question first, telling me she likes the coffee from here and the crepes, while Starfire is a voracious eater who likes the sweets this place offers. I thank them for their advice and go order my food, ordering a crepe and a sweet drink that Starfire recommended. When they get theirs Starfire asks if I want to sit with them, which I tell them I’ll be happy to do. I get my food a second later and the three of us go outside and sit at a table near the entrance to the cafe. 



“So I’m Lalo. I got here earlier today and have been getting my bearings.” I tell the two titans. Starfire is chatty and energetic and as we eat she does a lot of the talking. Raven interjects occasionally but she seems almost comforted by Starfire’s energy. The titans are interested when I mention that I’m living at the University and mention that some of their friends live and work there as well, which interests me. 



“So… What are your powers?” Raven asks, giving me a curious look. 



“I can fly. I discovered I could fly a week before I got here. It’s a handy power but I like to stay walking if I can.” I explain, causing Raven to nod.



“Staying grounded is a good attitude. Superpowers can be a lot.” She admits. The titans and I exchange numbers when we’re done with our meal and we go our separate ways, for the time being at least. I return home and as I do I am grateful for some of the whimsical magic I have attained that allows my clone to do stuff like instantly clean a space. The clone is in the bedroom and I can both hear and feel the pleasure he is experiencing and inflicting on some of my possessions. His dick is inside the mouth of the Ebony Blade’s doll form and I mentally examine the Black Widow ass effects we have gained through this particular bout of sex; namely that our abilities are stronger on those who are attracted to us and that we are more effective in battle against people based on how much they like us, which is a powerful, and deadly, ability to use if you’re a traitor or something. 



I look at the apartment and begin to set up some of my stuff. I quietly craft a table and set it up in the living room before placing my laptop on it and using telekinesis to begin to surf the web. A second later I use spatial warping to make this part of the apartment bigger. This is a simple usage of the ability and one I like a lot, as it allows me to really go buckwild when setting up bases and the like. I kneel down and reach into my inventory to retrieve a button. I touch it to the floor and press down on it, causing it to enter the hard wood of the apartment’s living room. As it does this the whole apartment expands and takes on new qualities.



I have just manifested and used the “Harem Housing” item, which is a housing item that allows me to take a housing situation and make it fit for a harem of any size. This means that any kind of housing can fit and expand to accommodate any number of lovers, children, and even changes to suit the needs of specific lovers. 



Over the course of the night I have a bit of fun with some of my less used talents and I quietly make myself a recording booth using a tricky combo of spatial warping, metacreativity, collector (a new perk that allows me to summon copies of things I have engrams of) and my world archive (an upgraded Worldwalker item that gives me generic engrams of every pre-chain, real-world, object and animal, as well as some legendary and mythical objects and animals). Once I’ve created my recording booth I take out an item I’ve only rarely used from Skyrim’s Scenario Supplement; the Boon of Y’ffre, which is a shapeshifting musical instrument. 



Being a bard is something I infrequently take advantage of along my adventures. In this jump I can have fun with musical talents and use them to become famous even outside of the super-harem I will inevitably be at the center of. I turn on the equipment in my booth and I begin to play, recording some songs from Skyrim which in this world is a game that both exists and is popular. 



I play the songs perfectly and take advantage of my supernatural singing voice to flawlessly record several distinct performances in a row of different songs. A drone with the power to record things flies around me as I perform, capturing footage of me from different angles. I record the total suite of Skyrim bard songs and decide that that’s enough for the time being. For the remainder of the night I quietly edit the songs, releasing a cover of the Tale of the Tongues as my first video and going ahead and sharing it online. 



I can’t sleep. I don’t just not need to sleep, sleeping is an actively bad idea for me thanks to a drawback I was assigned that will fill my dreams with horrifying night terrors. So until I can get more clones and become even more industrious I’ll be going ahead and doing stuff like this at night. As the sun starts to creep out over the horizon I feel its rays stretch out and touch me. I don’t actually need to eat but there’s a part of me that just likes eating so I turn off my computer and get up. 



In minutes I’m stepping into a breakfast restaurant located near the university and I am delighted when I see Supergirl of all people in the clothes of her alter-ego sitting on a high-top chair and ordering herself a meal. I make my face a mask and go sit next to her. The waitress catering to Supergirl smiles at me and tells me she’ll be with me soon. Supergirl turns and when she sees me she smiles in surprise but very quickly regains her composure. She smiled just long enough for someone with super senses and super speed like me to catch it before making her face a mask. 



“Good morning.” I tell her with a warm nod. She is dressed in a professional outfit though not one that tells me what this world’s version of Supergirl does when she’s not being a superhero. When the waitress who took Supergirl’s order comes and takes mine I order a Texas Melt and some soda. I almost never buy food thanks to my abilities but I taper down AA enough to make it not give me three times the food I’m buying and instead only make the food cheaper. Kara’s order, coffee and a stack of pancakes, comes and when it does I laugh. She asks me what’s funny.



“Did you know that there are Waffle Houses in other worlds? It’s like some goofy universal constant.” I tell her. She uses this as a way to ask me if I’m not from around here. ",3,1770558935.0,JumpChain,0,1.0,False

I built Moonshine, a native Swift menu bar app that saves and restores your entire workspace — window positions, audio devices, dock settings, and running apps — automatically when you. connect or disconnect monitors.

The problem: Every time you dock your laptop at work, plug into your home setup, or go to a coffee shop, macOS scatters your windows, routes audio to the wrong device, and you spend 5-10 minutes getting everything back in place. No single app solves all of this together.

What Moonshine does:

\- Window memory — Saves and restores every window's exact position and size across all displays. Works with Chrome, VS Code, Slack, Finder, Terminal, Firefox, and more.

\- Multi-monitor profiles — Automatically detects your display setup by hardware (vendor/model/serial). Plug in your monitor and everything snaps back. Works with any number of displays.

\- Audio routing — Switches output and input devices per profile. Restores volume levels too. Go from laptop speakers at the coffee shop to your USB mic + headphones at your desk,automatically.

\- App launching — Remembers which apps were running per profile and silently launches them in the background when a profile activates.

\- Dock position — Saves dock orientation (bottom/left/right), autohide setting, and icon size per profile. Dock on the left with your ultrawide? Bottom with just the laptop? Handled.

\- Manual profiles — Same monitor at different locations? Create multiple profiles and switch manually from the menu bar.

\- Keyboard shortcuts — Ctrl+Opt+R to restore, Ctrl+Opt+C to re-capture.



What I'm looking for:

10 beta testers to try Moonshine before launch and report bugs, UX issues, or edge cases I haven't hit. Especially looking for:

  \- Multi-monitor setups (2+ external displays)

  \- Mixed monitor brands (e.g., Dell + LG + Apple)

  \- Dock/undock workflows (MacBook + Thunderbolt dock)

  \- Unusual app setups (lots of windows, niche apps)

  

What you get:

 \- Free license for the final release (launching at $14.99, one-time purchase — not a subscription)

 \- Direct line to me for feedback

Requirements: macOS 14 Sonoma or later. Requires Accessibility permission (not sandboxed — this is how window management works on macOS).

Website: [https://moonshine.griffoncrest.com](https://moonshine.griffoncrest.com)

If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me. I'll send you the build directly.  
Even if you can't test, an upvote helps me gauge interest and motivates an earlier release.

1qz9ehn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz9ehn,Complete 5 Star Cooking (F2P),"My cooking addiction started when I found out that placing 5 star food gives a special ‘gliterring’ visual so from then , I aimed to collect all 5 star food. I must say that the hardest food to 5 star are those that requires eu crayfish which was also my very first 5star. I was lucky enough to get its 5 star on first try BUT I forgot to turn off my settings and a friend ATE it on my kitchen display so ironically it became my last 5 star piece in my collection as getting eu crayfish is hard.

Second hardest are the Doris Cakes (those that needs specific color of sugar) not only they are rare (can only buy when Doris spawn) but also very limited as you only have 20 (and its color is random). I wish that we can exchange different colors to Doris in the future , or maybe make all colors available but limit the purchase to 20 in total.

Third are more annoying than hard but those that need wheat because there’s A LOT of them and also with fruits if youre lazy picking berries, apple and mandarines. If youre not lucky enough, youll need HUNDREDS of each as JAMS requires 4 per dish.

If you want to collect 5star foods, I suggest only start seriously aiming for it once you hit lvl8 cooking and dont waste those hard to get ingredients until youve reached lvl8 including the RB boquet. Lvl 7 and below seems to have lower odds.

Oh and dont stress yourself out trying to click the flame thingy on green. Trust me, it doesnt matter. Ive had several 5stars with me clicking it in red because of those evil goblins living in my house, I mean pets.

Bonus Tips:

Always max buy those ingredients from Massimo. Youll need LOTS of eggs for example. Butter, milk, coffee, etc. 50 a day isnt enough espcially once youre at those mushroom pies.

Using RB flower boquet indeed gives higher chance of getting 5 star foods so use it wisely though, I dont know why but per boquet session, I usually only get 4-6 5stars. Prioritize those food with scarce ingredients when using this. I also used this on those JAMS that requires forraging as I am lazy getting berries and fruits.

If gold and wishing stars isnt an issue, using the ‘secret ingredient’ thingy (sorry i forgot its name but I am not talking about the universal ingredient, Im talking about the other one that adds 1star to your dish) though I only used these when Im on boquet sessions. 

Event foods-

If youre lvl8, you dont need anything special like RB boquet and that secret ingredient thingy. Dont waste them unless you are hard stuck on lvl7 cooking and just wanna perfect the cooking catalogue.",10,1770558596.0,heartopia,0,1.0,False

Here's what I do differently now.,"I quit my job as Head of Growth at a fintech to build my own thing. Had savings, had a co-founder, had what I thought was a great idea. So we went dark for 8 months and built.

No blog. No social media. No talking to potential customers. Just heads down building because I was convinced someone would steal the idea if we talked about it. Looking back thats embarrassing to admit but at the time it felt like strategy.

We launched to nothing. Not criticism. Not rejection. Just silence. The kind of silence where you refresh your analytics dashboard 40 times a day and the number stays at zero. My co-founder and I sat in a coffee shop the day after launch staring at each other like ""now what.""

The product wasnt bad. We actually got decent feedback from the few people who tried it. The problem was that nobody knew we existed and we had zero relationships with the people we were building for. Eight months of building and we hadnt talked to a single potential customer.

Heres what I do completely differently now:

I dont build anything until Ive talked to at least 30 people who have the problem Im trying to solve. Not surveys. Actual conversations. Most of them will tell you things that make you uncomfortable. Thats the point.

I build in public now. Not in the cringey ""day 47 of my startup journey"" way. But I talk about what Im working on, what problems Im seeing, what Im learning. The people who engage with that become your first users.

I stopped being precious about the idea. Nobody is going to steal your startup idea. Execution is everything and most people cant even execute on their own ideas let alone yours.

The stealth mode thing felt like strategy but it was actually fear. I was afraid of putting something imperfect out there. I was afraid of hearing that maybe the thing I was building didnt matter. Stealth mode is just expensive procrastination disguised as strategy.

If you are reading this and you are currently in stealth mode, stop. Go talk to 10 people this week about what you are building. The discomfort you feel doing that is the exact work you are avoiding.",4,1770558437.0,Entrepreneur,5,0.83,False
1qz9bbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WordPress_org/comments/1qz9bbw/the_great_backup_showdown_allinone_wp_migration/,The Great Backup Showdown: All-in-One WP Migration and The Big 4 (which one actually fits your stress level?),"I have a confession to make. For years - literally *years* (since 2014) *-* I’ve been in a ""committed relationship"" with the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin.

It started innocently enough. I needed to move a client site from a terrible shared host to a shiny new VPS. I was dreading the usual FTP nightmare, the database export timeouts, the broken image links… you know the drill, and my old trusted friend / BackupBuddy let me down several times in that period on such hostinings). A friend told me, “Just use All-in-One. Click export, click import. Done”.

I didn’t believe him. It couldn't be *that* simple.

But I tried it. And it worked. No timeouts. No 500 errors. No white screen of death. Just a progress bar that actually finished.  
It felt like magic. Since then, it’s been my ride-or-die. Every site I launch, every domain I swap, every time I need to save a snapshot before a risky update - it’s been my go-to.

But recently, I realized something:  while All-in-One is perfect for *my* workflow, the WordPress world is huge. There are other massive names in the backup game - plugins people swear by, fight over in Facebook groups, and recommend in every “best of” list.

I wanted to dig deeper. Not because I’m switching (spoiler: I’m not), but because I wanted to understand the *business case* for the other guys. Why would someone choose UpdraftPlus? When is Jetpack the better call? Is Duplicator actually easier?

So, I spent the last few weeks analyzing the following tools:   
**UpdraftPlus**, **Jetpack Backup**, **Duplicator** and for **BlogVault** I already knew as I have been using it on some sites, too. I wanted to see how they stack up against my old faithful, not just on a feature sheet, but in real-world scenarios.

Here is what I found. If you’ve ever wondered which backup plugin actually fits your specific type of stress, this is for you.

# The “Real Question” you need to ask first

Before we go into deatils, let’s be honest about something: most “best backup plugin” lists are useless because they ignore context. A freelancer moving 10 sites a month has totally different needs than a business owner who just wants to sleep at night without thinking about databases.

So, before you pick a tool, ask yourself:

1. **Are you moving sites?** (new host, new domain, staging to live?)
2. **Are you protecting a live site?** (need daily/hourly backups that restore instantly?)
3. **Do you want control, or do you want a “magic button”?**

Different plugins shine in different scenarios. Let’s break them down:

# 1. All-in-One WP Migration & Backup: the ""It Just Works"" heavyweight

Let’s start with the one I know best. If you’ve ever tried to migrate a WordPress site manually, you know the classic traps: timeouts, memory exhaustion, serialized data corruption, and the dreaded “why are all my images broken?” moment.

All-in-One WP Migration is built around one core philosophy: **make full-site moves boring.**

**Why I (and millions of others) love it:**

* **The single file ""magic"":** it exports your *entire* site (database, media, themes, plugins) into one `.wpress` file. You don’t have to chase down loose folders.
* **The chunk strategy:** this is its secret weapon. It processes data in tiny **512 KB chunks**. This bypasses the strict upload limits and timeout rules on cheap shared hosting. If you’ve ever had a migration die at 90%, this architectural choice is why All-in-One usually succeeds where others fail.
* **Automatic URL replacement:** it handles the search-and-replace for URLs and file paths during import. No more broken links or mixed content warnings after moving domains.
* **Developer friendly:** it has WP-CLI support, granular exclude options (e.g., “don’t export the spam comments”), and integrates with modern tools like WordPress Playground (SQLite support!).

**Where it can be annoying:**

* **The Free Limit:** the free version has a strict size limit (usually 512MB). If your site is bigger (and most are), you need the Unlimited Extension. It’s worth it, but it’s a hurdle for hobbyists (not problem for me and my business as I use Agency License).
* **Export Quirks:** very rarely, on super restrictive server environments, the export connection can drop. It’s uncommon, but it happens.

**Best for:**

* Agencies and freelancers who move client sites constantly.
* Anyone who wants a reliable “pack it up and move it” button.
* Teams that need a repeatable migration workflow.

**The verdict:** if **migration** is your main headache, this is the king. It turns a weekend project into a coffee break.

# 2. UpdraftPlus: the ""Swiss Army Knife"" of backups

UpdraftPlus is very popular dedicated backup plugin in the repo - if you ask for a recommendation in a Facebook group, five people will shout “Updraft!” before you finish typing.

**Why it’s popular:**

* **Cloud storage:** it connects to *everything*. Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, Rackspace, FTP… if you have storage, Updraft can probably send a backup there.
* **Granular control:** you can schedule separate schedules for files and databases. Want the DB backed up every hour but files only weekly? Easy.
* **The ecosystem:** it’s been around forever, so there’s a tutorial for everything.

**Where it feels less “hands-off”:**

* **Restores can be tricky:** while it has a restore function, I’ve found that on complex sites or when moving between very different server environments, it sometimes requires some manual troubleshooting.
* **Resource heavy:** on larger sites, the backup process can sometimes chew up server resources, slowing things down while it runs.

**Best for:**

* Site owners who want traditional, scheduled backups sent to their own cloud storage (like Google Drive).
* People who like having lots of knobs to turn (what to back up, where, and when).

**The verdict:** UpdraftPlus is the **flexible classic**. If you want full control over where your backups live and don’t mind a bit of configuration, it’s a solid choice.

# 3. Jetpack backup (VaultPress): the ""Set It and Forget It"" safety net

Jetpack (formerly VaultPress) is the “Apple” approach to backups. It’s designed for people who don’t want to know what a database prefix is; they just want to know their site is safe.

**Why it’s appealing:**

* **Real-Time backups:** this is huge for ecommerce. It backs up every change as it happens. If an order comes in at 2:00 PM and the site crashes at 2:01 PM, you don’t lose that order.
* **One-Click restore:** it really is one click. You don’t need to install a plugin first or FTP into the server. You log in, hit restore, and it fixes itself.
* **The activity log:** it pairs backups with a detailed log of *who* did *what*. “Oh, the site broke because Dave updated a plugin? Let’s rewind to 5 minutes before Dave logged in”.

**Trade-offs:**

* **The ecosystem:** You have to use Jetpack. Some devs hate the bloat of the full Jetpack suite (myself as non-developer included).
* **Cost:** it’s a subscription service, and real-time backups aren’t cheap.
* **Not a migration tool:** while you *can* use it to move sites, it’s really designed for protection, not migration.

**Best for:**

* WooCommerce stores where losing data means losing money.
* Non-technical owners who want a “magic undo button.”

**The verdict:** Jetpack Backup is for people who want backups to **disappear into the background -** until the day they save your life.

# 4. Duplicator: the developer's favorite

Duplicator is another massive name, especially among developers who build sites locally and then push them live. It’s famous for its “installer.php” method.

**Why people choose it:**

* **The package system:** it bundles your site into a zip file and a PHP installer script. You upload both to the new server, run the script, and it unpacks everything.
* **Cloning:** it’s fantastic for developers who have a “starter site” blueprint they want to clone for every new client (PS I have been using All in one for this, for our WP Template site duplicating).
* **Control:** it gives you a lot of manual control over the deployment process.

**Considerations:**

* **Higher technical barrier:** unlike All-in-One’s drag-and-drop, Duplicator requires you to be comfortable with FTP and creating empty databases manually on the new server. It’s not for total beginners.
* **Pro version needed:** like most, the best features (like drag-and-drop installs or cloud storage) are locked behind the Pro version.

**Best for:**

* Developers who are comfortable with FTP and databases.
* People who want to clone “blueprint” sites quickly.

**The verdict:** Duplicator is the **developer's tool**. If you know your way around a server and want a robust cloning tool, it’s excellent.

# 5. BlogVault: the agency powerhouse

BlogVault isn’t just a plugin; it’s a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. It’s built for agencies and people managing multiple sites who treat backups as part of a bigger workflow.

**Why it stands out:**

* **Offsite processing:** the backups happen on *their* servers, not yours. This means zero load on your website while the backup runs.
* **Staging magic:** it has one of the best one-click staging features out there. You can spin up a staging site, test an update, and push it live seamlessly (I use it very often, when some site isn't on Site Ground servers - our main hosting, which offers staging feature as well).
* **Reliability:** it has a very high success rate for restores because it doesn’t rely on your hosting server’s resources to do the heavy lifting.

**Trade-offs:**

* **Price:** It’s priced like a professional tool. It’s overkill for a single hobby blog. I was lucky to buy 30 Lifetime licences when they were on AppSumo many years ago (it was a one-time payment).
* **Interface:** you manage backups from their dashboard, not inside WP admin (though some prefer this).

**Best for:**

* Agencies managing 10+ sites.
* Sites where downtime is expensive and you want a “managed” safety layer.

**The verdict:** BlogVault is for **PROS**. If you’re managing client sites and want backups + staging + uptime monitoring in one place, this is the gold standard.

# The Cheat Sheet: which one fits YOU (and your business)?

Okay, that was a lot of words. Let’s simplify it. If we were having coffee and you asked me what to install, here is what I’d say:

* **Pick All-in-One WP Migration** if you move sites often, hate technical headaches, or need to clone sites from staging to live. It’s the best *migration* tool, period.
* **Pick UpdraftPlus** if you want a reliable, free (or cheap) way to schedule backups to your Google Drive and like having control over the settings.
* **Pick Jetpack Backup** if you run an ecommerce store, have a budget, and want a literal “undo” button that requires zero technical skill.
* **Pick Duplicator** if you are a developer who loves cloning sites and is comfortable with FTP and manual database setup.
* **Pick BlogVault** if you are an agency or freelancer managing multiple client sites and want a professional dashboard that handles backups, staging, and updates off-server.

# The honest bottom line

After digging through all of them, did I change my mind?

Honestly… no. I’m still sticking mostly with **All-in-One WP Migration**.

Why?

Because my biggest stress isn’t usually *daily backups* (my SG hosting handles that pretty well). My biggest stress is **moving things**. I’m constantly spinning up test sites, moving clients to better hosting, or pulling a live site down to local to fix a bug.

For that specific workflow - the “pack it up, move it, unpack it, and have it just work” workflow - All-in-One is still unmatched (at least for me and my mentioned business case). The chunked uploading, the auto-URL replacement, and the sheer reliability of the import process make it indispensable for me.

The best backup plugin isn’t the one with the most features. It’s the one you actually trust to work when your hands are shaking because you just deleted the wrong table.

Choose the one that fits your stress level. And please, whatever you do - **make a backup right now.** Don’t wait until later. “Later” is when sites break. 😉

1qz9bae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buyingforbaby/comments/1qz9bae/stroller_regret_what_to_do_now/,Stroller regret - what to do now,"So my husband and I had done a ton of research and landed on the Joie Ginger LX and Mint Latch Travel system. Went to purchase online and realized Joie discontinued the LX version and I didn’t love the original Ginger so we decided to start looking again, dabbling in Nuna research. I had sent my mom a link to the Nuna Mixx Next and Pipa URBN travel system and she found it on a good deal through a friend of a friend’s employee discount and excitedly pulled the trigger and purchased for us without really confirming that’s the one we absolutely wanted. She got a good percentage off the original price and saved $400. We just got it delivered and we realized it’s heavy and large and not easily foldable. Of course then my algorithm starts showing me all of the things wrong with this stroller and how much better the Nuna Triv LX is. After doing more research, I’m wishing we had got the Triv LX. Baby isn’t due until April so we still have some time but I guess my questions are: Do you have the Nuna Mixx Next and do you love it or hate it and why? And if it’s the worst stroller ever, what do you suggest we do? I’m super close and honest with my mom and I told her I wish I had gotten the other one and she’s telling me if I can find someone to buy the Mixx Next, then she’ll buy us the Triv LX instead. But I don’t even know where to begin on selling it and returning it back to the store isn’t an option unfortunately. My husband is 6 ft, I’m 5’9 and it’s likely our baby will be long/tall. We like to go on long road trips to the coast but we don’t hike and never plan on taking our stroller “off roading” lol. I will be taking the baby out alone a lot for coffee shop runs, quick trips to see family, etc. Any and all advice is welcome! Thank you!",1,1770558364.0,Buyingforbaby,3,0.67,False

1qz98sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alone-Broccoli-9153/comments/1qz98sn/part_six_of_my_story/,part six of my story,"Just a couple of weeks after the confirmation at Walmart, I received a call from Mrs. A. She said she would be visiting in a few days and needed to speak with RPA about something important, asking me to pass along the message. By that point, I had stopped wearing my wedding ring. To me, it had become nothing more than a painful reminder that my marriage had fallen apart. The white and gold band, once beautiful with its half-carat diamond and smaller diamond chips along each side, now symbolized only sorrow.

Whenever RPA noticed my ring in its box, he would ask when I planned to put it back on. He made empty promises that he would change and keep me in his life. The day his mother was scheduled to arrive, he even begged me on his knees to wear the ring again. Reluctantly, I agreed, allowing him to slip it onto my finger once more.

When Mrs. A came to our door but did not hug RPA.  Instead, she slapped him across the face and snarled, “I raised you better than that.” RPA took the slap without protest, staring down at the floor in shame. I brought out a couple of chairs for her and D. Despite the warmth of that spring day, the atmosphere in the room turned cold as I served them some iced tea.

That was when RPA’s web of lies began to unravel, starting with Mrs. A’s confrontation. As I went to light a blue candle for RPA’s deceased son, Mrs. A stopped me, saying, “Don’t, sweetie—I have to talk to the boy.” I turned around, startled, wondering if she meant to communicate supernaturally with the child. But Mrs. A, noticing my expression, clarified, “No, he called the house via AT&T.” I stood there in shock, unable to speak, looking from RPA to his mother. I told her, “I swear to god I didn’t know.” She gave me a warm smile and replied, “I know.”

In an instant, RPA leapt to his feet, snatched his car keys, and bolted out the door. The three of us sat in tense silence as the sound of his Trans-Am tires screeching out of the parking lot echoed through the air. Mrs. A turned to me with a searching gaze and asked what RPA had told me, but I was still paralyzed by shock, unable to find the words. Instead of answering, I hurried upstairs and retrieved a copy of RPA’s résumé, handing it to Mrs. A. As she read through the details, her complexion paled, and then she silently passed the document to D, who examined it next.

It was in that moment that the reality of RPA's military service became painfully clear. Contrary to the stories she had shared, RPA had only served in the Marine Corps for approximately sixteen months, and his time ended with an other-than-honorable discharge. He had never left the United States, despite any claims to the contrary.

As the truth surfaced, memories from the past came rushing back. I recalled a particular incident when I discovered his driver’s license inside the tent, alongside his DD Form 214. On that occasion, I had glanced at the document and read a few lines, which revealed that RPA had broken a cue stick over his commanding officer’s kneecap. The altercation had occurred because the officer was speaking with RPA’s girlfriend at the time.

Until now, I had nearly forgotten about that event, but with the revelations unfolding before me, it suddenly stood out as another example of the secrets and half-truths that characterized our relationship.

The realization left me feeling as if I had wandered into a blizzard, completely lost and disoriented. I had to sit down. Looking up at Mrs. A, I saw her simply sigh, a sad acknowledgment that it was RPA’s decision whether or not to tell me the truth. I didn’t even notice when they left. Slowly, I removed my wedding ring and placed it on the coffee table, where its presence was stark against the forest green oval surface. The significance was clear: everything RPA had ever told me was a lie. Our entire life together had been built on deception. I had always been honest and open, but he had never given me the same in return, not even once.

As the weight of every lie pressed down on me, tears began to flow, each one accompanied by the painful repetition of his falsehoods in my mind. I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at the ring, until I heard the roar of the Trans-Am as it returned to the parking lot. I didn’t bother to look up when RPA came in. He paused at the base of the stairs while I sat on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Without looking at him, I asked, “Are your feelings for me real?” RPA stormed upstairs without saying a word, slamming the second bedroom door shut behind him, and then, at the top of his lungs, shouted a single word: “FUCK.”

After the confrontation with Mrs. A and the unraveling of RPA’s lies, our relationship began to deteriorate rapidly. By August of that year, things had reached a breaking point. We were facing eviction from our townhouse, unable to keep up with the bills on our combined incomes. I had returned to work at Wendy’s, despite my misgivings, because we desperately needed the money. Even with my job and RPA’s position at Walmart, our financial situation remained dire.

Working just a few blocks from the Walmart where RPA was employed, I often heard from coworkers or acquaintances if RPA was seen speaking to any other woman, Jess would tell them you know he is married. They would come by the restaurant to tell me about him. These constant reports cut deeply, and by that point, I had not only built walls around my heart but had constructed a moat around my soul—one that felt twenty feet deep and ten feet across. Sometimes, it seemed like RPA was calling out to me from the other side, but I was no longer willing or able to listen.

Eventually, we packed up all our belongings and placed them in a storage unit. We moved to a small town near the Kansas-Colorado border called Lumar, where a new Walmart was being built. RPA secured a job in loss prevention there, while I found work at Carl’s Jr. Known as Hardee’s on the East Coast. Though we tried to start over, the damage had already been done.

It wasn’t long before RPA returned to his old patterns—disappearing without explanation and leaving me alone to wonder about his whereabouts. I tried to be patient, holding out hope that things might change, but by the end of October, the inevitable happened. One evening, he walked into our room, sat heavily on the bed, and, without any preamble, declared that he no longer loved me.

I looked up from the television, stunned by his words. In that moment, something inside me snapped. Without hesitation, I pulled off my wedding ring and hurled it across the room in anger and pain. I told him plainly that if he didn’t love me, he was free to leave—and to “fuck off.”

The shock on his face was unmistakable. He scrambled to retrieve the ring from where it had landed, hidden behind the motel dresser. Returning to my side, he grabbed my hand and forced the ring back onto my finger, desperately trying to make amends. He leaned in, attempting to kiss me, and insisted, “I swear, babe, I was just joking.”

On the first day of November, a memory that remains vivid to me even after all these years, the events of that Sunday morning unfolded with a quiet intensity. I had go out to the car, hoping to find some change in order to finish our laundry. When I opened the glove box, I found, tucked among the papers, a simple engagement ring. The band was gold, with a stone larger than the one in the ring I was wearing. I returned the ring to its place and went back to our room, where RPA was sitting on the bed, absorbed in the start of the football game.

Somehow, the atmosphere in the room seemed to shift; the air felt colder. Sensing my mood, RPA turned to me and asked what was wrong. I met his gaze and responded with a single sentence, each word sharper and colder than the last: “I found it.” Instantly, RPA’s face turned pale. He tried to explain, “Honey, I wanted to get you something new—you know, new beginnings.”

I looked him in the eyes and reminded him, as I had many times before, that I hated regular gold. Without a moment’s hesitation, I threw my ring at him once again and declared, “I am done.” He immediately slid off the bed and dropped to his knees, pleading, “Please don’t leave me.” I wriggled out of his arms, determined to stand my ground and prove my point. I didn’t want to take the ring back, knowing it came from Walmart, I wanted one that was white gold. His face became even paler, and he simply stuttered, “I can’t.” I managed to free myself from his grasp, shaking my head no; I refused to let him see me cry again. I ran into the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. As I looked into the mirror, it felt as if someone had taken a permanent marker and written “SUCKER” in big letters across the glass.

Moments later, I heard the roar of the Trans-Am coming to life outside, signaling to me that I was finally, truly done with this man. After that, I barely spoke to him at all. If I did, it was with brief, dismissive responses—“yeah, whatever,” or “sure,” or muttered under my breath, “I don’t give a shit.” Of course, the ring disappeared soon after I found it. He offered one excuse after another: “It’s safe,” or “It’s in a safety deposit box,” or even, “The dog ate it.” I just shook my head and walked away, unbothered by his fabrications. I was finishing my final plans to leave, knowing there was a Greyhound station just down the street from our hotel.

But about two days before I was set to leave, I heard his car roaring into the parking lot. His footsteps pounded up the stairs as if he were sprinting. He threw open the door with a frantic look and stared at me. “You’re leaving me,” he blurted out. I responded, “Damn it,” then looked at him and I asked, “How did you find out?” He explained that he had gone to pick me up from work, only to learn I had already quit, and my boss had called him “trash.” For the next few days, he begged me to change my mind. I told him plainly: if he wanted me to stay, he had to give me the ring. He just shook his head and said, “I can’t.” At that, I answered, “Oh well. I can’t stay.”

The day I left Colorado for the final time was marked by a sense of finality that I had never felt before. As I prepared to go, he continued to plead with me, begging me over and over to reconsider and stay. His desperation was evident, but I had already made up my mind. Then, amidst his pleas, he uttered words that solidified my resolve: “You are just like my other ex-wives.” Hearing that, I turned to face him and spoke with clarity that it was his actions, his choices, and his words—that had led us to this point. He was the one who had destroyed what we once had, the one who had dug the grave for our relationship and marriage. Without another word, I picked up my things, climbed onto that bus, and left without looking back.

In the months that followed my departure from Colorado, RPA discovered that I was staying with my mother and grandmother in North Florida. After the New Year, the only year I remember the Denver Broncos winning the Super Bowl—he drove all the way to Florida, bringing along a dog that was in heat and Missy. The visit was brief and tumultuous; it lasted less than a week before RPA was on his way back to Colorado and, inevitably, to another woman. My mother overheard him speaking with her on the phone, confirming my suspicions.

By the following Sunday, RPA had left once again. The pain of his absence lingered, and for a long time, I found myself unable to listen to Reba McEntire’s song “For My Broken Heart.” Every word of that song seemed to echo exactly how I felt during those difficult days. Then, not even a month later, RPA was calling me in a drunk state, crying about how badly he screw up our relationship. Please give him one more chance. I agree and sent him gas money for the drive. In the long run, I gave him only $ 100 because he had changed his mind, and he went and joined the Army. How I found out was that I was studying for my GED. I got a call from RPA telling me he was in basic training, looked at the receiver in my hand like it had grow other head, sure enough, he had joined the Army.

That summer, after much pleading from RPA, I agreed to attend his graduation at Fort Bragg. By then, I had dyed my hair a deep red and was embracing a new, Gothic look. I arrived in a short black dress and six-inch heels wrapped around heels, drawing the attention of everyone present. I simply smiled behind my dark lipstick, unfazed by the stares. When the ceremony ended, RPA turned to me, his face full of shock at my transformation. But at that point, I was beyond caring what any man thought I should or shouldn’t do.

After his initial surprise faded, we went to lunch with Mrs. A. During the meal, RPA excused himself to use the restroom. While he was gone, Mrs. A confided in me that RPA woman had more or less stolen the Trans-Am, leaving him penniless. She then asked me directly about my intentions towards her son. I was honest with her—I told her I was finished living in any man’s shadow and that it was time for me to forge my own path in the world. Mrs. A simply smiled and said, “Good for you.”

Later that night, I did sleep with RPA, but I made him wear a condom. Once it was over, he rolled over and went to sleep, but I lay there feeling nothing for him—no spark, not even a trace of affection for the man beside me. The next morning, while he was in the shower, I took off my ring and left it on a note on the hotel stationery. I told him to keep everything, not to look for me, and not to call my mother. I ended the note with a simple goodbye—my final farewell.

After that summer, I decided to start fresh. I got a tattoo and began to reinvent myself, becoming just another face in the local Gothic scene. My journey eventually led me to Kentucky, where I spent the next two and a half years building a new life. During this time, my family kept a close eye on RPA, especially since he had lied to the military by claiming we were not still married. That lie resulted in a financial benefit for me, as I received a substantial check, which I used to fund my move to Kentucky.

In 2002, an unexpected turn of events unfolded. I had lost my ID and needed to get a new one, so I made my way to Fort Knox. There, I received surprising news. Before the clerk could turn the computer screen away, I caught a glimpse of RPA’s records and saw that he had remarried. The date of his new marriage stood out—it was February 14 of that year. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. I realized in that moment that I was no longer bound to him; we were truly finished, and I could finally move on with my life.

In 2005, I learned through RPA’s Myspace post that he had been seriously injured while serving in Afghanistan. According to his message, he had lost his leg from the knee down, an eye, a testicle, and part of his small intestine while guarding a children’s hospital. The news was shocking, and I needed confirmation. I called his mother, who solemnly told me that it was all true. She explained that RPA had crashed twice on the operating table, fighting for his life. I could only offer to pray for him. She thanked me quietly before hanging up the phone.

A couple of weeks after the events that had finally brought me closure with RPA, I was jolted awake in the early hours of the morning by the persistent ringing of our phone. It was 3:00 a.m., and Papa Bear, clearly irritated by the interruption, mumbled that someone had better be dead to justify calling at such an ungodly hour. When he picked up the phone, she asked if she could talk to me. I was met with the sound of RPA’s fourth wife, her voice trembling and filled with anguish as she sobbed uncontrollably on the other end.

Through her tears, she accused me of being the reason RPA had ended up in the barracks, demanding to know how I could have done something like that to her. Her words were laced with desperation and confusion, but I had no patience left for the tangled web of his life or the drama that inevitably followed him. I responded flatly, telling her, “Well, you’re the dumbass who married him in the first place,” and promptly hung up.

After I returned to bed, Papa Bear pulled me close, a hint of amusement in his voice as he remarked, “That was cold.” I simply rolled over, unfazed, and went back to sleep, leaving the chaos of RPA’s world behind me once and for all.

For many years after leaving Colorado and closing that tumultuous chapter with RPA, I found a sense of peace in my life. It wasn’t until 2011 that I began attending Lander and enrolled in a speech class that old memories resurfaced. For one of my assignments, I chose to speak about the signs of emotional and physical abuse—subjects I knew intimately from my own experiences. My history included living with men who inflicted both physical and emotional pain; one had hurt me physically, while the other, RPA, was a master of emotional manipulation.

On a warm October day, as Papa Bear drove me to school, our conversation drifted to the past. He joked, wondering aloud how strange it would be if I were still connected to ‘one leg man’—our nickname for RPA at home. I quickly told Papa Bear to stop, not wanting to invite thoughts of RPA back into my world. Yet, as I prepared my PowerPoint for class, curiosity led me to contact El Paso County records office to obtain copies of relevant paperwork. To my disbelief, I discovered that RPA had knowingly committed bigamy at least once. I had married Papa Bear in 2002, believing that chapter with RPA was firmly closed. The truth was shocking, but I was grateful to have finally moved on and found happiness with a wonderful man.

In October 2012, just a year after my speech class revelation, I witnessed a moment that brought everything full circle. At the courthouse, I watched as RPA was rolled up the wheelchair ramp in a chair. He was no longer the man I once knew. Years before, he had been proud of his baldness, wearing it like a badge of honor, much like a fellow Texan in the wrestling world. Even after injuring himself playing softball, he insisted on wearing jeans during the summer months until his leg healed—a testament to the vanity he once held.

After learning about RPA’s devastating injuries, it became clear that the man I once knew was now forever changed. He was confined to a body that no longer matched the vibrant, glory-seeking spirit he had so desperately clung to in his youth. Seeing him being wheeled in by another woman, I was struck by the realization that the admiration and validation he had spent his life chasing had ultimately led to unimaginable loss. The price of that pursuit had been far greater than he ever anticipated.

With that final revelation, I felt a sense of closure. The chapter of my life that had been overshadowed by RPA’s choices and my own pain was finally ending. With a stroke of a pen, I closed that part of my story, filing it away as another footnote in the larger book of my life.

With these reflections, I close this last chapter, hoping that my story offers some comfort or understanding to those who may read it.

Good luck, I hope you find your own happy ending

1qz96zd,https://v.redd.it/y6pd2562y9ig1,How Benares dynasty commissioned North India’s greatest Ramayana paintings,"The last bloom of North Indian art
The popularity of Ram, the ideal god-king, rises in times of political churn in India. The 1700s were no exception. Though Benares was most holy to Shiva, the ruling Narayan dynasty were great devotees of Ram. The Ramcharitmanas was, to them, the ideal text: it depicted Shiva as a devotee of Ram, and Ram as a devotee of Shiva reconciling Benares’ two most powerful religious strands. Patronising the Ramcharitmanas was guaranteed to bring popular acclaim.

When the Ramcharitmanas was first composed in the 1500s, the idea of telling Ram’s story in the vernacular was not popular at all. Tulsidas, its creator, was snubbed by the city’s conservative Shaivite Brahmins. In her introduction to Book of Gold: The Kanchana Chitra Ramayana of Banaras, the late art historian Kavita Singh quotes one of his verses: “Some call me a fool, some call me a sage, some call me a [high-caste] Rajput, some a [low-caste] weaver… I don’t need to ruin anyone’s status by associating with them. Everyone knows I am the slave of Ram… if I need to, I’ll beg for my food and sleep in a mosque.” The booming Benares of the 1700s, home to many Vaishnavite ascetics, instead welcomed the Ramcharitmanas with open arms. Unlike Valmiki’s Ramayana, its Awadhi language made it instantly accessible to all the city’s castes and people.

And so, the Narayan court hosted Ramcharitmanas scholars and developed a lavish Ramlila performance that lasted for weeks at a time. (It continues in Benares to this day). Completely sidelined by the British, the Narayans reached out to all their contemporaries, inviting artists to create the first-ever fully illustrated Ramcharitmanas. Artists came from Delhi, which, in its imperial twilight, had become home to coffee houses, provocative Urdu literature, and Mughal-obsessed British White sahibs. They came from Lucknow, where the Nawabs of Awadh presided over a court of music and dance and European fashions. They came from Kota and Jaipur in Rajasthan, dazzling with colourful textiles and avant-garde artists. Some were drawn by family and professional networks. Others, as Singh notes, may have been sent by nawabs and rajas in a show of diplomatic solidarity.

The Kanchana Chitra Ramayana was to have nearly 1,100 pages, of which 548 were illustrated. Each illustration took months to finish. It needed the attention of master sketchers and outliners, apprentice painters, and expert illuminators to create its gilded borders and golden palaces. It needed a constant supply of precious materials to turn into paint and pigment. Its workers needed food, residences, and cash. Most importantly, it needed project managers to assign pages to specific workshops, to put artists in touch with religious teachers who could explain complex philosophical ideas, and to manage calligraphers and illuminators for each page.

The pages of the Kanchana Chitra Ramayana are startling to look at, because of the sheer variety of regional and individual styles on display. The delicate, exquisite empathy of the Mughal courtly artist; the heavy-lidded eyes of the Jaipuri; the architecture-focused composition of the Awadhi.

Did I do/say the right thing?,"First I’m going to start off by saying this is my first time posting, so I’m genuinely sorry if I mess up in anyway. I will 

I’m going to start off by running through the day and the conversation we had that day. I will also be referring to her as T. So this all happened on Wednesday (2-4-26). I got up to go to drive truck that day. I sent T a good morning text as I do everyday. Then I went to work and called T at 6:30 to make sure she was up for her job. We talked about me coming over after we both got off work and we both said that we couldn’t wait to see each other. 

So let’s fast forward to when I arrived at T’s house. I walked in and me and T hugged. I went to back off the hug and she wouldn’t release from the hug so I continued hugging her. I then told her I missed her today and she said she missed me too. When T released from the hug she looked down and then looked at me and said she thinks she is a lesbian. I instantly started tearing up and responded “you can’t be doing this to me again.” Me and T talked and she was telling me that I was the best boyfriend she has ever had and I was amazing. She said she just feels like there is more of a spark with women. She still wanted to be friends and that I was her best friend. We talked for an hour that night before I left and went home. I was in shock and didn’t really know what to say besides you’re fine when she apologized and I confessed that I AM NOT TRYING TO MAKE HER FEEL GUILTY, but I was planning on marrying her soon, so this just is really hard. I have been looking for my own house and wanted that before asking her. We always walked each other to our vehicles and when I got in my car T was telling me all the stuff we always said before we left each other’s house “drive safe, don’t speed too much, watch out for deer, and text me when you get home.” I proceeded to accidentally say I love you and then apologized. It just came out because we always said that before leaving. She said I love you too just I not in that way. 

When I got home I texted her and laid down for bed. She then called me to help her fix her breaker box because I did it the last time I was at her house. The moment I heard her voice I started crying harder. T apologized for calling because it was a face time and she could see how upset I was. I took the next day (2-5-26) off of work. I couldn’t mentally drive a commercial truck for 10+ hours just being by myself. So I had a whole day to think about what I was thinking. I went over that day to drop off her Christmas presents that finally came in. I didn’t realize it was a preorder lol. As well as her valentines gift that came in literally that day. She didn’t hear me knock so I just dropped them on her island just through the door. I did ask T if it would be okay to drop them in the house so I just put them on the counter directly through the door and took off. I called her later that day after I had time to think about what I wanted to say. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to go on the trip to Texas with her for her grandpa’s funeral. I told her it would be too hard on both of us I I did. I told T that I wanted to go to be there for her but I think it would be easier on the both of us if I didn’t. She started telling me about how she was doing and so I told her what I got to thinking about. I told her it would be best if we were not friends right now. I told her this doesn’t mean indefinitely just I think it would be better. I told her that it hurts me to say that because I love her and that she is my best friend. I heard her immediately choke up and start crying harder. I told her I always just wanted her to be happy and I want her to live the one life she was given on the earth exactly how she wanted too. I said that all I want is to see her succeed in life and find out what she wants in her life. I then made a joke about how if I found out she was getting with another guy I will throw rocks through her window which made her laugh. T then told me that if she finds out she doesn’t want to be with a women she would want to be with me, but not to wait on her because it wouldn’t be fair to me. I told T that if that ever happens and I’m with someone else by then that she go find another guy as well. I told her that we never know where we will be in the future and who knows we might be together later down the road. I said that I think we need to cut back on communication for a little bit. I told her we can still keep our streak on Snapchat. I thought it was best because I think we both need time to figure everything out and I don’t want to hold her back from finding out what she wants. I just felt it would give me false hope and it could possibly make her want to get back with me and not have the time to figure herself out. I told her that I can no longer be there for the minor problems but if something major comes up do not hesitate to call me. I told her that maybe this time apart would be for the best we wouldn’t have to check in like we always did and we wouldn’t have to worry about each other as much we can just have our on time. She told me she would always worry about me. She always worries a lot because in my field of work I have to haul over weight to make a profitable day and where I bring it is not always a safe and flat location to dump the stone. I told her that I would always worry about her. We then just talked for a minute and joked around a little. She then confessed she was scared to tell her parents because she texted her parents to tell them I was no longer going to Texas and wondering if the ticket was refundable. This trip was supposed to happen the following Thursday. Her mom was asking what happened and kept trying to call her. I told her that the cutting back communication didn’t have to start after the call ended and if she needed to talk because her parents can be a lot and they have always been controlling so she doesn’t have the best relationship with them. She never called back.

I hate every day that goes by that I can’t talk to her. She was my best friend and the person I planned to marry soon and live the rest of my life with. I really don’t know how to go on right now. I texted our mutual friend L(19F) I have know since 6th grade and she has been friends with T for about 3 years. Asking L and T’s other friend C (19 F) that I also grew up with but wasn’t that close with if they would make sure they continue checking up on her because I just want to make sure she is all right and I just want her to be happy. I was worried because she has mental health issues and has attempted before. I don’t know if I did the right thing and I don’t plan on never talking to her again. I plan on keeping it how it is for about a month then asking her to meet me for coffee not to attempt to get back together, but I want to see her and hear her voice again. Last night she finally recovered her apple account so I think she was able to see my location. I believe this because it said she read the message I sent on Thursday at 4 something on Saturday and I was finally able to see her location. I think she was trying to see what I was doing. Which this may sound bad but made me feel better because I do that I check every once in a while if she made it to work or home. I still deeply care for her but I’m not trying to stalk her. Sorry got a little side tracked there.

So Reddit did I do/say the right thing? And is the coffee thing a good idea?

He waved, grinned, and disappeared ahead while I sat there fuming. That image haunted me for the rest of the day. Eight miles to work. That was my commute. Eight miles that somehow took 45 minutes most mornings because of traffic. Meanwhile, Jake was probably already at his desk with his coffee. That weekend, I walked into a bike shop feeling slightly ridiculous.

The guy working there had me test ride one, and I wasn’t prepared for how it felt. The motor kicked in with my first pedal stroke, and suddenly I was moving faster than I expected with almost no effort. He explained how the assist levels worked, how I could control how much help the motor gave me. Hills that would normally destroy me? Suddenly manageable.

I kept thinking about arriving at work sweaty and gross, but he showed me how adjustable the assist was. I could dial it up on hot days to minimize exertion. Rain was another worry until I saw all the weatherproof gear available.

The price made me pause, but I did the math. Gas, parking downtown, gym membership I
barely used. Three months after that traffic jam, I sold my car. My morning commute went from stress to actually enjoyable. I even started browsing Alibaba for accessories, which became its own little hobby.",1,1770557628.0,HomeDecor_Furniture,0,1.0,False

HELP MARVIN'S MARVELOUS MECHANICAL MUSEUM REOPEN

[https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-marvins-museum-reopen](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-marvins-museum-reopen)

For generations, Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum has been more than a place. It has been a feeling. It is the sound of laughter echoing through aisles of blinking lights. The clink of coins. The wonder on a child’s face the first time a mechanical figure springs to life. Created by the late Marvin Yagoda, this magical museum has welcomed families, first dates, longtime friends, and curious kids for decades. It is where memories are made and where time seems to stand still. Marvin did not just collect machines. He created joy. And that joy became part of our community.

Today, that magic is at risk. Due to redevelopment, the museum was forced to leave its longtime home in Farmington Hills. While we have secured a new and larger space at Orchard Mall, the journey has been far more difficult than anyone anticipated. Moving hundreds of delicate, irreplaceable machines, upgrading the new space, and protecting Marvin’s extraordinary collection has come with rising costs at every turn. We have truly tried to do this on our own. We stretched every dollar. We absorbed increasing expenses. We kept moving forward even when it felt overwhelming. Now we are in the home stretch. The doors can reopen. The lights can come back on. The laughter can return. We just need a little help to cross the finish line.

That is why we are asking the community who loves this place to stand with us. Your support will help us safely move and protect Marvin’s collection, complete the new museum space so it can welcome the public, and preserve this one-of-a-kind experience for future generations. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a difference. Every share helps spread the word. Every act of generosity brings us closer to reopening the doors. Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum is not just a museum. It is nostalgia. It is wonder. It is magic. Please consider donating today and helping us keep Marvin’s marvelous dream alive.

[Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Sgn22oEdk&t=1) combat is racing toward a tipping point where speed, data and exotic physics matter more than radar cross section alone. Seventh generation fighters, hypersonic strike weapons and quantum-enabled sensing are converging into a battlespace that could make today’s stealth jets look like analog relics. The same technologies that promise unprecedented reach and precision are also eroding the very invisibility that defined airpower for a generation.

I [see](https://www.wionews.com/photos/what-is-a-hypersonic-fighter-jet-the-next-big-shift-in-air-combat-1757579140588#:~:text=Experts%20suggest%20that%20hypersonic%20fighter%20jets%20are,and%20safety%20remain%20barriers%20to%20near%2Dterm%20adoption.) three intertwined revolutions driving this shift: aircraft that blend autonomy with extreme speed, missiles that compress decision time to seconds and quantum tools that can both expose and protect forces in ways classic radar never could. Together they are forcing militaries to rethink what “survivability” means after stealth.

# The contested future of stealth

For decades, low observable design has been treated as the entry ticket to high-end air warfare, yet senior technologists are now openly questioning how long that advantage can last. Rob McHenry, the Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has argued that the combination of proliferating sensors and advanced processing risks making traditional stealth an “attractive but elusive technology,” a warning that reflects [DARPA](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/why-darpa-thinks-stealth-is-obsolete-in-future-wars/#:~:text=Rob%20McHenry%2C%20Deputy%20Director%2C%20Defense,an%20attractive%20but%20elusive%20technology.) concern that survivability must be redefined. Analysts describing an emerging “electromagnetic armageddon” argue that dense networks of emitters and receivers, spread across land, sea, air and space, are beginning to close the gaps that once allowed aircraft like the F-35 to hide effectively, a trend captured in detailed [Key Points and](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/electromagnetic-armageddon-era-of-stealth-bombers-and-fighters-might-soon-be-over/#:~:text=Key%20Points%20and%20Summary%20%E2%80%93%20The,F%2D35%20to%20hide%20effectively.) on how modern radars are eroding low observability.

[Top-10 USGS critical minerals like Niobium, Dysprosium, and Terbium, plus Scandium, Titanium\/TiCl₄, and magnet REEs \(Nd\/Pr\). That’s a full-spectrum industrial basket tied directly to defense, aerospace, EVs, SMRs, drones, missiles, and AI-era manufacturing.](https://reddit.com/link/1qz8o9m/video/6ax6dtsdr9ig1/player)

At the [same](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/forget-ngad-or-the-j-20-a-7th-generation-fighter-could-hit-mach-5/#:~:text=Given%20the%20risks%20inherent%20to,scenarios%20like%20air%20superiority%20missions.) time, other defense experts caution against declaring stealth dead, noting that each new detection technique must still be integrated into a kill chain that can track, target and engage fast-moving aircraft. Research that surveys emerging radar and computing technique concludes that while new systems will complicate operations, Stealth will likely remain a core Air Force tool for decades to come, a view captured in analysis that notes Stealth has survived multiple predicted demises and that, But for all the hype, it still underpins U.S. airpower [today](https://defenseacquisition.substack.com/p/headlines-drones-cmmc-and-sda#:~:text=Stealth's%20demise%20has%20been%20predicted%20many%20times%2C,Air%20Force%20tool%20for%20decades%20to%20come.). The result is not a clean obituary for stealth but a transition toward platforms that treat low observability as one ingredient among many, rather than the whole recipe.

# Seventh generation fighters: speed, autonomy and space

Seventh generation concepts build directly on that shift, treating survivability as a system-of-systems problem that fuses speed, autonomy and multi-spectral management. Reporting on future designs describes seventh generation fighters as autonomous, hypersonic, multi-spectral stealth platforms able to coordinate swarms of sensors and shooters, a vision that would make the F-35 look obsolete by comparison and could reshape air warfare for decades, as highlighted in recent [analysis](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/the-7th-gen-fighter-that-makes-the-f-35-look-obsolete/vi-AA1Sjvat#:~:text=Seventh%2Dgeneration%20fighters%20won't,reshape%20air%20warfare%20for%20decades.). Another detailed explainer on the next leap in air power emphasizes that the seventh generation fighter explained properly is less a single jet than a node in a wider combat cloud, with the next leap in air power expected to make today’s jets obsolete and set the tone for power projection for decades to come, a perspective captured in [Jet Insight](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/the-7th-generation-fighter-explained-why-the-next-leap-in-air-power-makes-today-s-jets-obsolete/vi-AA1VlUY6#:~:text=Jet%20Insight-,The%207th%20generation%20fighter%20explained%2C%20why%20the%20next%20leap%20in,power%20for%20decades%20to%20come.) coverage that underscores how software and networking will matter as much as airframes.

Some visions go even further, sketching a hypersonic, space-traveling 7th generation stealth fighter that could operate in near-space regimes and carry directed energy weapons. One such concept, described as potentially flying by 2050, links the rise of the U.S. Space Force and the necessary task of preparing the U.S. military for offensive and defensive operations against intercontinental ballistic missiles or even hypersonic weapons, a connection drawn explicitly in a forward-looking [assessment](https://warriormaven.com/news/air/a-hypersonic-space-traveling-7th-gen-stealth-fighter-may-fly-by-2050#:~:text=This%20of%20course%20has%20inspired,ICBMs%20or%20even%20hypersonic%20weapons.) that notes, “This of course has inspired the creation of a US Space Force and the” broader shift to orbital [defense](https://www.openpr.com/news/4378845/quantum-warfare-market-emerging-technologies-defense#:~:text=Quantum%20warfare%20refers%20to%20the%20military%20application,enhance%20defense%20capabilities%20and%20counter%20adversarial%20threats.). Even nearer term, discussions of a 47 designated next generation fighter suggest that an Air Force Chief Confirms an F-47 Next Generation Fighter Jet First Flight in 2028, a detail circulating in [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/FighterJets/comments/1owqyj6/us_air_force_chief_confirms_f47_nextgeneration/#:~:text=Thecontradicter-,US%20Air%20Force%20Chief%20Confirms%20F%2D47%20Next%2DGeneration%20Fighter,Jet%20First%20Flight%20in%202028) discussions that, while not yet officially corroborated elsewhere, reflects how quickly planning is moving toward a post-sixth-generation era.

# Hypersonic strike and the shrinking decision window

While [airframes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOaneGWOCic#:~:text=From%20Cold%20War%20flying%20wings%20to%20today's,aerospace%20heritage%20meets%20the%20future%20of%20deterrence.) evolve, the most disruptive change may come from weapons that travel at hypersonic speeds and maneuver unpredictably. The United States has already reached a major hypersonic weapon milestone with a new long-range system, a development framed as historic in the contested race for such capabilities and described as a moment when The United States signaled it does not intend to sit out of this arms race, according to detailed reporting on a recent [test](https://airforcetechconnect.org/news/us-reaches-major-hypersonic-weapon-milestone#:~:text=6%20August%202025,out%22%20of%20this%20arms%20race.). Parallel work on Conventional Prompt Strike, or CPS, aims to deliver non-nuclear effects at ranges comparable to intercontinental ballistic missiles, with assessments noting that CPS offers capabilities comparable to nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles while employing conventional warheads, and that the U.S. Army’s LRHW is part of a broader portfolio whose effectiveness will take time to fully assess, as outlined in an overview of [current programs](https://dsm.forecastinternational.com/2025/12/22/an-overview-of-current-u-s-hypersonic-missile-developments/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Army's%20LRHW%20is,to%20fully%20assess%20CPS%20effectiveness.).

Industry is racing to keep pace, with a recent Press Release describing how GE Aerospace and Lockheed Martin Demonstrate Rotating Detonation Ramjet for Hypersonic Missiles, a propulsion breakthrough that could make future weapons smaller, faster and more efficient, as detailed in [hypersonic](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html#:~:text=Jan%2014%2C%202026,Third%20Party%20Article) updates. Naval forces are adapting too, with Capt. Trinque stressing that “We have to continue building not just better missiles, but finding better ways to use our vertical launchers,” as the Navy explores a new missile that could serve both air defense and be a hypersonic strike weapon, according to [naval](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2026/01/new-us-navy-missile-to-support-hypersonic-strike-air-defense-roles/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20to%20continue%20building,be%20a%20hypersonic%20strike%20weapon.) reporting that underscores how ship magazines are being reimagined. Analysts tracking global developments note that hypersonic missiles are able to travel at extraordinary speeds and maneuver unpredictably, compressing reaction time and demanding decisive action on the battlefield, a dynamic highlighted in a recent [update](https://www.mirasafety.com/blogs/news/hypersonic-missile-update#:~:text=Able%20to%20travel%20at%20extraordinary,decisive%20action%20on%20the%20battlefield.) that also points to the role of systems like the Patriot defense system provided by the United States.

# Quantum war: sensing, targeting and the end of hiding

[Quantum](https://www.pass4sure.com/blog/inside-the-cyber-battlefield-threat-hunting-and-detection-explained/#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20now%20operate%20in%20stealth%20mode%2C,security%20doctrine%E2%80%94from%20static%20protection%20to%20dynamic%20anticipation.) technologies are emerging as the wild card that could finally tip the balance against stealth, even as they create new forms of protection and attack. Strategic assessments of Quantum Sensing and the Future of Warfare argue that Quantum’s Military Promise lies in sensors that will keep pushing the limits of detection, generating new radar and LiDAR signatures that can spot objects conventional systems miss, a prospect laid out in a set of Five Essential Reforms to Stay Competitive that warns Western forces must adapt quickly to [quantum sensors](https://www.csis.org/analysis/quantum-sensing-and-future-warfare-five-essential-reforms-stay-competitive#:~:text=Quantum%20sensors%20will%20keep%20pushing,new%20radar%20and%20LiDAR%20signatures.). A separate analysis notes that since the Chinese Politburo’s study session in 2020 on quantum science, quantum references increased from 2% of Chinese science and technology planning documents to a much higher share, and that Quantum sensing will enable precise detection and targeting that could ravage millions of innocent people if misused, a sobering warning in a broader discussion of how the quantization of warfare is reshaping strategy and ethics in [conflict](https://thequantumrecord.com/philosophy-of-technology/quantization-of-warfare/#:~:text=Quantum%20sensing%20will%20enable%20precise,ravage%20millions%20of%20innocent%20people.).

Concrete hardware is already appearing. Chinese sources describe a photon catcher built by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Center in Anhui province, characterized as an ultra-low noise, single-photon detector with four channels that can detect even a single particle of light, a device that Beijing claims as the “world’s first” and that could underpin quantum radars to track advanced stealth fighters like the F-22 Raptor jet, according to detailed [reporting](https://www.facebook.com/NextGenerationWeapons/photos/china-producing-world-first-quantum-radars-to-track-us-stealth-jets-like-f-22chi/1251303863690569/#:~:text=Advanced%20jets%20with%20enhanced%20capabilities%20The%20US,has%20already%20started%20working%20on%20the%20jet.) that also notes Advanced jets with enhanced capabilities The US Navy has already started working on the jet. Another account explains how a Chinese quantum radar sends pairs of entangled photons toward a target area and, Upon reflection, measures the returning photons to infer the presence of stealth aircraft, a method that, if operationalized at scale, could dramatically reduce the effectiveness of classic low observable shaping, as described in technical [summaries](https://www.facebook.com/groups/849994733672039/posts/1202367558434753/#:~:text=The%20quantum%20radar%20sends%20pairs,%2D%20in%20New%20York%2C%20NY.) of the system. Analysts like Bharat Karnad argue that It ( quantum technology ) is not happening anytime soon but Quantum technology will mark the end of stealth aircraft too, linking this to broader trends in Cyberwar and more, a perspective laid out in a call to speed up the hypersonic to the FOBS regime that frames quantum as the eventual stealth killer [over time](https://bharatkarnad.com/2024/11/17/speed-up-the-hypersonic-to-the-fobs-regime/#:~:text=It%20(%20quantum%20technology%20)%20is%20not,and%20more%20but%20that%20for%20another%20day.).

**The “Death of Stealth” = The Rise of a MATERIALS WAR — and Elk Creek Is Sitting Dead Center**

That Feb 7th air-combat piece nailed the real shift happening right now: stealth alone isn’t the ace card anymore. The future battlespace is becoming an “electromagnetic armageddon” where survivability is about **speed, power, cooling, data, autonomy, and exotic physics** — not just radar cross section. Seventh-gen fighters, hypersonic weapons, swarm warfare, and quantum-enabled sensing are compressing decision time to seconds. And when that happens, the real bottleneck stops being “design” and becomes **Materials + Supply Chain**. This is the start of a *materials war*.

That’s why the 2026 USGS report hits like a hammer: America’s critical minerals problem isn’t “we forgot to mine.” It’s that **China controls too much of the chain** — mining, processing, separation, refining, magnets, and downstream leverage. The U.S. response is now turning into a policy machine: **Project VAULT** (stockpile + procurement), **FORGE** (allied pricing/trade bloc logic), and **EXIM** (financing weapon). **Washington isn’t asking nicely anymore — it’s building a national-security procurement lane where strategic projects get plugged in and funded.**

Elk Creek isn’t a “one-mineral junior.” It’s a **Seven-mineral strategic basket** sitting in the middle of the exact USGS/Vault/FORGE thesis: **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium/TiCl₄, and magnet rare earths including Nd/Pr plus Dy/Tb**, with additional REE recycling potential. **That’s basically the full ingredient list for next-gen defense manufacturing: hypersonics, aerospace structures, missiles, drones, actuators, guidance systems, high-temp alloys, and the magnet supply chain the U.S. is desperate to secure!**

Now add the part Wall Street is still sleepwalking through: **NioCorp’s downstream move into scandium alloys.** NioCorp formed **NAMA** and bought **FEA Materials’ proprietary IP**, which enables conversion of **scandium oxide directly into aluminum-scandium master alloy** — bypassing the costly scandium metal step. That’s the process breakthrough that could finally put ScAl into real industrial scale economics. And management has telegraphed a **Feb 2026 ScAl alloy reveal tied to Lockheed + the DoD for platforms and components**, which implies this is already beyond “lab coupons” and into defense-grade qualification work.

[And management has telegraphed a Feb 2026 ScAl alloy reveal tied to Lockheed + the DoD for platforms and components, which implies this is already beyond “lab coupons” and into defense-grade qualification work.](https://reddit.com/link/1qz8o9m/video/vb7nezhus9ig1/player)

This is the real inflection: if stealth is eroding, the winners are the platforms that can **fly farther, carry more, run cooler, survive sensor saturation, and integrate massive power systems** — and that requires **ScAl structural alloys, titanium systems, niobium-bearing superalloys, and magnet REEs**. That’s why Elk Creek is a U.S. must-have. It’s not just a mine — it’s the backbone of a domestic defense materials stack.

IMHO\~ NioCorp is lining up as a **vertically integrated U.S. industrial base buildout** — mine → processing → oxides → metals → alloys → (eventually) parts. With Vault/FORGE/EXIM now in motion, the March DFS becomes the stamp, and the mid-2026 EXIM FID logic becomes real.

**The catalyst stack is now lined up like dominos — Feb 2026 ScAl alloy/platform reveal with Lockheed + DoD, March DFS as the hard reset, and then the real endgame: offtakes + EXIM underwriting toward a mid-2026 FID. This is exactly why Mark Smith has been calling Elk Creek “a National Strategic Asset,” and even labeling it the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium.”**

Those aren’t hype lines anymore — they match the direction of U.S. policy, the USGS warning, and the reality of a post-stealth, hypersonic, sensor-saturated battlespace where materials decide who wins. Wall Street can keep pricing this like a Jr. miner… until the market finally realizes it’s watching America build a defense supply chain in real time!

HELP MARVIN'S MARVELOUS MECHANICAL MUSEUM REOPEN

[https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-marvins-museum-reopen](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-marvins-museum-reopen)

For generations, Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum has been more than a place. It has been a feeling. It is the sound of laughter echoing through aisles of blinking lights. The clink of coins. The wonder on a child’s face the first time a mechanical figure springs to life. Created by the late Marvin Yagoda, this magical museum has welcomed families, first dates, longtime friends, and curious kids for decades. It is where memories are made and where time seems to stand still. Marvin did not just collect machines. He created joy. And that joy became part of our community.

Today, that magic is at risk. Due to redevelopment, the museum was forced to leave its longtime home in Farmington Hills. While we have secured a new and larger space at Orchard Mall, the journey has been far more difficult than anyone anticipated. Moving hundreds of delicate, irreplaceable machines, upgrading the new space, and protecting Marvin’s extraordinary collection has come with rising costs at every turn. We have truly tried to do this on our own. We stretched every dollar. We absorbed increasing expenses. We kept moving forward even when it felt overwhelming. Now we are in the home stretch. The doors can reopen. The lights can come back on. The laughter can return. We just need a little help to cross the finish line.

That is why we are asking the community who loves this place to stand with us. Your support will help us safely move and protect Marvin’s collection, complete the new museum space so it can welcome the public, and preserve this one-of-a-kind experience for future generations. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a difference. Every share helps spread the word. Every act of generosity brings us closer to reopening the doors. Marvin’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum is not just a museum. It is nostalgia. It is wonder. It is magic. Please consider donating today and helping us keep Marvin’s marvelous dream alive.

I was tired of the default white background in SSMS, so I decided to recreate the **Capycocoa** VS Code theme to make long coding sessions easier on the eyes. I've manually tweaked the settings to ensure a consistent, warm experience across the entire editor.

**Key Features of this theme:**

* **Soft Cream Background**: Uniform color for the editor, line numbers, and margins to reduce eye strain.
* **Optimized Syntax**: Custom colors for **SQL Strings**, Local Variables, and System Functions.
* **Matching Results Grid**: The results grid has been customized to match the brown/cream palette.
* **Clean & Professional**: Perfect for those who find ""Dark Mode"" too high-contrast but want to avoid the ""Flashbang"" of the light mode.

**How to install:**

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Import and Export Settings...**.
2. Choose **Import selected environment settings**.
3. Select the downloaded `.vssettings` file.
4. I recommend checking **only** ""Environment > Fonts and Colors"" to keep your other personal settings (shortcuts, etc.) intact.

Now, I see me. I understand what I can be and what I want to be, though my only answer to the question “What do you do?” is “Being great”. What I’m looking for, as the title suggests is, a woman who is also in pursuit of greatness. I could do this in person, go out maybe, I tried, and failed. So thought I’d do it online again. I’ll write more about me in the coming sentences. 

I write this as I sip some Ginger Coffee (chukku kaappi as it is named in the native) from a whiskey glass, which is part of a set of 6, which I accidentally bought because I thought it’s one glass, and not one set.

An example of my cool-ness and my genius-ness is the fact that I wrote this post in Emacs’ org mode, which I recently have gotten into, it’s so much fun. This is what I am mostly like, I don’t have a specific topic that I am into, I go in all directions.

1qz8fem,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qz8fem/how_to_network_as_an_introvert_sciencebased/,How to Network as an Introvert: Science-Based Tricks That Actually Work,"ok real talk. networking feels like hell when you're introverted. everyone acts like it's supposed to be natural, like you should just walk into a room full of strangers and start chatting about synergies or whatever. but here's what nobody tells you: the most successful networkers aren't always the loudest people in the room. 

i've spent months digging through research, books, podcasts, youtube rabbit holes, trying to crack this code. talked to career coaches, read behavioral psychology studies, listened to actual introverts who built massive networks. turns out the whole ""networking"" game has been explained wrong this entire time. it's not about being fake extroverted. it's about playing to YOUR strengths.

the reason networking feels impossible isn't because you're broken or antisocial. it's because society pushes this one-size-fits-all approach that honestly works better for extroverts. you're fighting against your biology when you try to become someone else at these events. your brain literally processes social stimulation differently. you're not weird, you're just wired different.

but here's the good news: introverts have SECRET advantages in networking that nobody talks about. you can build deeper connections, people actually remember you more, and you waste less energy on surface level BS.

leverage one-on-one conversations instead of group settings

forget the networking events with 100 people. they're overstimulating and superficial anyway. focus on coffee chats, lunch meetings, or even just DMs that turn into video calls. introverts are INSANELY good at deep conversations when it's just two people. this is your superpower.

research from organizational psychologist Adam Grant shows that introverts often build more meaningful professional relationships because they actually listen instead of waiting to talk. people feel heard around you. that's rare and valuable.

practical move: after meeting someone briefly (even at a big event), send a message like ""hey really enjoyed our quick chat about \[specific thing\]. would love to continue this over coffee if you're down."" most people say yes because it's flattering and low pressure.

prepare conversation starters and exit strategies

this sounds calculated but honestly it's just smart. having 3-4 go-to questions in your back pocket removes the anxiety of blanking out. try stuff like ""what's the most interesting project you're working on right now?"" or ""how'd you get into this field originally?"" 

the trick is asking questions that make THEM talk. people love talking about themselves and they'll walk away thinking you're a great conversationalist even if you barely spoke.

and here's the thing nobody admits: you need exit strategies. it's ok to have a polite way out. ""this was great, i'm gonna grab another drink but let's connect on linkedin"" or ""i should probably mingle a bit more but seriously let's continue this later."" you're not being rude, you're managing your energy.

use asynchronous communication to your advantage

email, linkedin messages, twitter DMs, whatever. this is where introverts absolutely dominate. you can craft thoughtful messages, edit them, make sure they're good before sending. no pressure of real-time responses.

i use this app called Dex (it's basically a CRM for personal relationships) to track everyone i meet, add notes about our convos, set reminders to follow up. sounds robotic but it's honestly a game changer because my brain doesn't naturally remember to reach out to people.

send articles or resources that remind you of them. ""saw this and thought of you"" messages are LOW effort but HIGH impact. shows you actually pay attention.

quality over quantity always

you don't need 500 linkedin connections. you need 15-20 people who actually know you and would vouch for you. focus on building real relationships with a smaller group instead of collecting business cards like pokemon.

there's this book called Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi (bestseller, dude literally wrote THE networking bible). but here's the twist: the most valuable insight isn't about eating with people constantly, it's about being genuinely helpful and staying in touch consistently. this book will make you rethink everything about professional relationships. insanely practical advice that doesn't feel gross or transactional.

another book that changed how i see this: Quiet by Susan Cain. she's a harvard law grad who literally studied introversion for years. this book breaks down the science of why introverts are different (spoiler: it's about how your nervous system processes dopamine). best part is the chapter on networking and leadership. she profiles successful introverted leaders and shows how they built influence without pretending to be extroverts. genuinely one of the best books i've ever read on understanding yourself.

if you want to go deeper on networking psychology but don't have hours to read dense books, there's this app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. it's an AI-powered personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns networking books, career psychology research, and expert insights into customized audio podcasts. 

you can set a specific goal like ""i'm an introvert who wants to build genuine professional connections without draining my energy"" and it generates a structured learning plan pulling from resources like the books mentioned above, plus communication research and real success stories. the depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples and frameworks you can use. makes learning feel less like homework and more like having a smart friend explain things while you commute or work out.

find your networking format

not all networking happens at happy hours. look for:

• smaller industry workshops or seminars (30 people max)

• online communities in your field (discord servers, slack groups, reddit even)

• volunteering for causes you care about (automatic conversation starter plus you're doing good)

• professional development courses (you're learning AND meeting people with similar interests)

i found most of my actual valuable connections through niche online communities, not fancy networking events. people are more authentic when they're behind screens anyway.

follow up within 24-48 hours

this is where most people fail. you meet someone cool and then... nothing. send that linkedin request or email while you're still fresh in their mind. include something specific you talked about so they remember you.

template that works: ""hey \[name\], really enjoyed our conversation about \[specific topic\] yesterday. especially that point you made about \[thing they said\]. would love to stay connected and hear how \[their project\] develops.""

reframe networking as learning, not selling

stop thinking you need to impress people or prove your worth. approach it like you're genuinely curious about what they do and want to learn from them. this takes the pressure off and makes conversations feel natural.

people can smell desperation and self-promotion from a mile away. but genuine curiosity? that's magnetic. 

also there's this youtube channel called Charisma on Command that breaks down social dynamics in a way that doesn't feel cringe. they have videos specifically about networking as an introvert. the insights about body language and conversation flow are surprisingly useful.

use your listening skills strategically

introverts typically listen more than they talk. this isn't a weakness, it's literally your competitive advantage. people LOVE being heard. they'll remember you as someone who ""gets it"" even if you barely shared anything about yourself.

take mental notes (or actual notes later) about what people care about. their challenges, goals, interests. then follow up on those specific things later. ""hey remember you mentioned wanting to learn about \[thing\]? just came across this resource.""

set boundaries and honor your energy levels

you don't have to attend every event. pick the ones that matter most. arrive early when there's fewer people (less overwhelming). give yourself permission to leave when you're drained.

networking isn't about forcing yourself into exhausting situations constantly. it's about sustainable relationship building over time. slow and steady wins here.

protect your energy like it's a currency because it literally is. you can't build good connections when you're running on empty and forcing fake enthusiasm.

the whole ""introvert networking"" thing stops being painful when you stop trying to be someone else. play to your actual strengths: depth, listening, thoughtfulness, authenticity. those qualities build better networks anyway.",1,1770555932.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

She attempted to order coffee as it was listed as a big sale. Each checkout attempt failed so she kept trying different cards.

She realized the mistake after she called black rifle coffee support phone number. How she got from death wish to black rifle, I do not understand but they advised her that it was a fake website and she cancelled her cards quickly before damage was done.

However, a few days later she got a call from her ""bank"". They were claiming to be from the fraud department and they were asking her about suspicious activity on her account. They listed off the first 7 digits of her bank card and asked her to confirm the rest of the information. She willingly did this and shortly after her bank account was wiped.

I didn't hear the phone conversation but the number on her call history matched her bank and she said they spoke with no accent.

I'm assuming the call was related to the coffee website as they probably had the first few digits of her cancelled card and used this info to impersonate her bank. 

When she got to the phony coffee site, it wasn't like she mistyped a URL in the browser, she was searching for black rifle coffee and somehow ended up at that phony site. I looked at her phone and it was a sponsored result when she searched for black rifle. How can something like this be kept up for so long? I can't seem to find it on a search result any more but I can bring up the site with the URL. It looks like a legimate online store. 

Also, I'm sure someone is going to ask, she doesn't drink the high caffeine stuff from death wish, they have regular strength coffee as well. She thought black rifle and death wish were the same company.

1qz8bbe,https://i.redd.it/4upt7iawq9ig1.png,Looking for advice on coffee machine that doesn't power on + missing portafilter [ISOMAC Tea],"Hi all, 

For context I found an Isomac Tea (same as picture) in the curbside waste in Victoria, Australia. So it was free! The machine has cleaned up beautifully (it did not look at all like the attached picture on the curb, and needed some TLC to clean it up). All parts are there apart from the portafilters. 

To the real issue... Unfortunately it doesn't power on when I plug it in! I have 2 questions and am hoping for advice/ recommendations: 

1) Is it worth repairing/ getting a technician to look at it (recommendations for Melb would be amazing if you have any). Or does anyone have ideas on what could be wrong?

2) Any suggestions on where to buy portafilters & which ones if so! 

I am a newbie to this level of espresso machine, so I am diving in the deep end, but think the machine is beautiful and I want to learn. Would love to hear your feedback on if it's a win or I'm setting myself up for failure!

Because when he tells me something I dont understand right away and want help, he doesn't think we have anything in common to talk about anymore, and even me trying to wake up with him in the morning makes him angry.

Without coworkers walking by or coffee breaks, I end up sitting in the same frozen posture for 6-8 hours straight. My back is wrecked.

I tried using phone alarms and Pomodoro apps to remind me to stand up, but I just swipe them away and keep working. The ""digital"" reminders don't work for me.

**So, I tried a physical solution.**

I’m building a custom desk that has a silent pulse mechanism built directly into the wood top.

* **How it works:** Instead of a loud alarm, the table gives a gentle physical ""nudge"" (vibration) through your wrists/arms.
* **The idea:** It breaks your focus just enough to make you realize, ""Oh, I haven't moved in an hour,"" without startling you like an alarm clock.
* **Bonus:** I also routed power outlets to the top of the desk because I’m done crawling on the floor to find a plug.

**The Question for other WFH folks:** If your desk physically ""nudged"" you to stand up, would you actually listen to it? Or would you find it too annoying to have your furniture vibrate while you're typing?

I am a 37-year-old secure man.
She is a 48-year-old FA woman — married, with a child, intelligent, social, strong personality.
We never had a relationship.
We had moments.
Cycle 1 – The Attraction
She made the first contact.
She suggested the first meeting.
She sought my presence.
Our conversations were deep, calm, intelligent. There was no drama, no scenes, no jealousy.
There was strong chemistry.
The first romantic evening — the tension was tangible. Her gaze would change, she spoke more softly, she sought physical closeness.
I did not cross the boundary.
After that, she froze.
Cycle 2 – Peak and Freeze
Second romantic evening — even stronger charge.
Hotel.
Wine.
Silence in the elevator.
A look that said, “Do it.”
I opened her room door, said good night, and left.
After that — disappearance.
There were no accusations. No insults. Just withdrawal.
Later I understood — it wasn’t a lack of feelings. It was overwhelm.
Cycle 3 – Controlled Meetings
After the first disappearance, she began initiating more controlled formats:
Coffee.
Lunch.
Short meetings.
Daytime conversations.
During those meetings, there was no disappearance.
The disappearing only happened after a romantic evening.
That’s when I started seeing the pattern.
The Realization
At some point, I understood that my presence was activating something she could not regulate.
I wrote her a letter.
Not blaming.
Not pressuring.
Not rescuing.
I told her I would not cross the boundary because I didn’t want to hurt her or deepen her internal conflict.
She responded.
She admitted that I had seen beyond her barriers.
She admitted that she had to get herself out of the “wrong situation.”
She said the page was not closed.
That was her most conscious moment.
After the Letter – 8 Weeks of Observation
There was no direct contact.
There were:
Story reactions.
“Bridges.”
Symbolic posts.
Late-night activity.
Insomnia.
Opening the chat without writing.
During a случайна encounter — she froze.
She was prepared to see me. She parked next to me. She entered the venue.
She did not come to say hello.
That was not indifference.
It was blockage.
My State
At first, I had the impulse to write, to do something.
Then I realized:
What is logical here is illogical.
I had to become a rock.
Not open bridges.
Not react.
Not rescue.
Not explain.
With time, it became lighter.
I did not stop living.
Work, sports, friends, family — everything continued normally.
There was no obsession.
There was interest and observation.
What I Saw in Her
She is a strong person.
She is intelligent.
She is self-aware.
But when feelings become real — she freezes.
She is not running from me.
She is running from the intensity inside herself.
The more real it becomes, the stronger the fear becomes.
Where We Are Now
Nine weeks after the last peak.
No conflict.
No ending.
No beginning.
There is a pause.
I am not waiting.
I have given myself an internal deadline.
If there is action — it will come from her strength.
If there isn’t — I accept it.
The Most Important Thing
I did not lose her, because I never possessed her.
I was not betrayed.
I was not lied to.
I simply encountered a person fighting an internal battle that I cannot fight for her.
Conclusion
This was not a relationship.
They were moments.
Either something new will happen — on equal ground, without cycles.
Or it will remain a beautiful, unfinished experience.
I am ready for both outcomes.",1,1770554828.0,FearfulAvoidants,0,1.0,False

I’m 22, and currently studying Biology + Industrial Engineering (focused on ecology & nutritional science). I live a structured, disciplined life, but I’m also trying to open myself to new experiences and perspectives. I’m a slim nerd, masc, Arabs–Chinese, 5'8"", and based in Indonesia.

I’m looking for new friends from anywhere! as long as we get along, it’s all good. I’m into lifelong learning and real talks, so I’d love to meet people who love talking about life, ideas, and random interesting things.

For fun, I listen to pop, alternative, rock, country, classics, and folk. I read sci-fi, draw imaginary maps, and I’m a beginner at traveling. Biology fieldwork also gets me outdoors a lot, so I love exploring Indonesia’s nature. I’m also into culinary adventures and healthy living (not vegetarian), and lately I’ve been doing a lot of cardio. I had retinal detachment before so I can't do any activities that can make my eyes strained.

I also like memes, cats, PC games (Stardew Valley, Fall Guys, TheHunter, Terraria, Minecraft), horror movies, and a bit of anime (Chainsaw Man, Azumanga Daioh, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu!!, Gachiakuta, Dr. Stone, Naruto, Pokémon (I wanna rewatch this), and Doraemon!). Oh, and I love drinkinh coffee + matcha at the same time!

I value mutual respect and balanced energy. I’m a bit old-fashioned about communication and boundaries, and I’m not into adult things easily. I’m also not into hookups. I’m into phone detox and productivity too! mindful tech use, deep work/focus time, and being present offline, so it’s a plus if you relate!!

I’ve also been living with a very disciplined routine. I’m an early bird and I keep my own daily schedule and to-do list. I really try to respect my time each day because I believe life is precious, so I want to use it as wisely and meaningfully as possible.

Most importantly, I want someone who can genuinely respect, understand, accept, and appreciate each other as we are. I’m the kind of person who's ISTP and likes to grow and move forward together, and I’m also big on planning and organizing, so I hope you can understand and be comfortable with that. If you’re more extroverted, I might be a little shy at first, and if you’re more introverted, that’s totally fine too! As long as we communicate and understand each other.

Sooo, I’m (21f), and my friend—let’s call him Jo (21m)—have been friends for almost 3 years now. We got to know each other through a mutual friend who is also my best friend and kind of his best friend too (she’s 4 years older than us).

When we first met, we used to go out as a group with other mutual friends, and everything was normal—no feelings, no crushes.

Since then, Jo and I didn’t go out a lot until last year because my work was close to his house. Sometimes I would finish early and call him to see if he wanted to go to a restaurant or a coffee place, and he would agree.

At first, the hangouts were nice and fun, but then I started feeling dizzy, my stomach flipping, and even nauseous like I mentioned before. Even just talking to my friend about what’s going on with him makes me nervous and uneasy.

I honestly don’t know if what I feel are butterflies in my stomach… or cockroaches… or a warning sign… or what.

I still haven’t told my best friend—our mutual friend. My girl told me to tell her everything, because maybe she could get a few words out of him and find out how he feels about me.

Jo is such a great person—caring, loving, and peaceful—and many of our mutual friends can attest to that.

I have never enabled that setting that allows Grok to remember previous chats and I have always used that button in the top-right corner to prevent any chats from being saved in the history.

Despite that, I am now noticing that Grok seems to remember things. Elements from previous chats, where I asked for specific changes to a fiction I had it write. And now Grok frequently uses those elements without me prompting it to do so.

And I'm not talking about anything that is common enough and could therefore show up so often randomly.

Without going into detail what it is exactly in my case, assume you have it writing a story where people go to some eatery and order something. It would be normal, if Grok's idea for what they're ordering is something like pizza. Perfectly normal. Something that could randomly happen. But something like fugu, civet coffee (don't look it up if you don't want to throw up), or fried tarantulas? Grok using that kind of thing seems unlikely, right?

Some of the 2/2 condos downtown look fantastic but small. Is anyone actually renting out those 2nd rooms?

I also found some 4/3 condos near the Mangrove Bay golf course that’s in my budget and I could rent out 2 rooms and still have a dedicated office but it seems so far away from the actual city. 

I’ve been looking at what Zillow calls Downtown, Historic Uptown, Crescent Lake, and Mariners Pass (for the one 4/3 condo) but I’d love some input:

	•	Where do you love living?

	•	Where should I skip?

	•	Any underrated areas?

Appreciate any advice, thanks!",0,1770554057.0,StPetersburgFL,10,0.15,False

1qz7qm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1qz7qm4/am_i_overreacting_or_is_this_worth_quitting_over/,am i overreacting or is this worth quitting over? could this be putting my life and safety in danger?," work at a coffee shop and yesterday I was electrocuted by our espresso machine at work. This was not a static shock. When it happened, I felt electricity travel up and down my arms, my entire body tensed up, and I was visibly convulsing. It scared me badly. I did not have visible burns, but my arms were sore for hours afterward and my body felt shaken.

This machine had been repaired the day before. I immediately reported what happened to my managers. Instead of shutting the machine down, I was told it was fine to keep using as long as we followed certain rules, like not touching the grinder and espresso machine at the same time and not placing the metal tamp on top of the machine. That already felt unsafe to me because no piece of equipment should require specific physical positioning to avoid electrocution.

Because I was genuinely concerned, I personally called a licensed electrician. He told me very clearly that the machine should absolutely not be used and that this was not a harmless static shock. He said that a machine involving water, metal, and electricity that causes electrocution indicates a grounding or wiring issue and needs to be taken out of service until inspected.

Despite this, one of my managers came in and said the electrician did not know what he was talking about. She used the machine anyway and got shocked. She then called our boss and told her it was fine to use. After that phone call, she attempted to use the machine again and was shocked worse than before and physically hurt herself.

When I escalated this to my manager’s boss, her reaction was to ask someone to touch the machine again and to ask if it was really “that bad.” This was extremely upsetting to me given that multiple people had already been electrocuted, including a manager. Even after all of this, the machine has not been formally shut down, and employees are still being put in a position where they are expected to use. my boss, not even my manager, my boss! Said that she’s stuck a fork in an outlet when she was a kid and asked if it was “ really that bad “and ask someone to touch it again to see if they got hurt.

I have refused to use the machine at all. I do not feel comfortable being asked to work around something that has already electrocuted multiple people, especially after a professional electrician explicitly said not to use it.

i’m worried about safety, I’m worried about my other coworkers, and I’m worried that three grown adults are not taking this as seriously as it should be taken. Like the cord wasn’t half plugged in or something like that the whole machine electrocuted people and it was literally just worked on the other day something definitely went wrong. All I know is what I researched and what the electrician said. This also violates several safety rules that are put in place for a reason.

I’m just wondering if I should quit over this because I’m transferring colleges starting this fall so I would really only be looking for a job until the end of summer and I don’t know if it’s worth it since I’ve been here for two years. No one else is taking it seriously not even my coworkers I feel like I’m the only one and I don’t know if I’m going crazy and overreacting because I’m paranoid from the shock before or if this could actually be life-threatening from what i learned online.

anyway if anyone could just help me out and let me know if I’m overreacting or not that would be great thank you",1,1770553880.0,WorkAdvice,18,0.57,False

coffee, hot coco, summer, the beach, the fires of Mordor, anything works for me!

I'm a nerdy stay at home parent looking for friends. I like to play cozy video games, read books (currently very obsessed with the dungeon crawler carl series) hike and bird watch. but our conversation does not have to be limited by my interests. I'm one of those super extroverts who can talk to anyone. if you have an interest different from mind I definitely will go down a few Google rabbit holes 

personality wise I like to joke around, I can be a bit childish, have a dark sense of humor, curse like a sailor (not sure if bad manners are a personality trait but didn't know where else to stick that warning) generally happy but angry at society vibes!

1qz7qim,https://i.redd.it/c4myr1sol9ig1.jpeg,Sentimental Sunday - Why do we find communication and connection so hard these days?,"So this isn’t a story, more of a sentimental observation about connections and communication. It’s something I briefly explored with my therapist (and a poor work friend over coffee this morning lol), and felt fitting for today’s theme. 

It’s a long one so if you’re not in a deep and meaningful mood today, I’d skip it 😂 If you do want to get deep (not that kind of deep 😉), then grab a cuppa and strap yourself in…

Why is connection and communication so hard these days? It’s by far one of the most common questions I come across here on Reddit. 

I think the internet gets blamed a lot for ruining communication and the way we view each other. And I do think it’s definitely played a large role in damaging friendships/relationships. It’s conditioned us in many ways to see people as dispensable, and in some ways not even human. 

When we’re chatting to someone online, essentially it’s just us and a screen. So it’s easier to disassociate and forget it’s a real human being we’re interacting with. Combine that with the fact there’s millions of people vying for our attention online, and how easy it is to move on to the next person who grabs our interest, connections just seem almost impossible to maintain. 

I’ve noticed in other friend groups over 40 on Reddit, you often see the same types of posts. People asking for genuine connections, asking why it’s so hard to find them, complaining about ghosting, and the same people posting looking for connections and seemingly never finding them. 

In my own experience, I think it’s because most aren’t honest about wanting a genuine, lasting connection. They want a distraction, or someone to flirt with to either make them feel good or fulfil a temporary need. They chase that initial excitement with making a new friend that ultimately fades, then move onto the next. There’s always someone else we’re going to have Mor or different things in common with. For some, it’s boredom, escapism, or even about monetary gain.

But I don’t think it’s all the internet’s fault. I feel if it was taken away and we were forced to just interact with the people around us, we still wouldn’t necessarily foster better connections. After all, isn’t that why we turn to the internet in the first place, because making connections and maintaining them in our vicinity is hard?

Ultimately they come down to communication and honesty, and that’s something so many people struggle with. Being honest, emotionally available, and vulnerable with the people in our lives isn’t easy. 

It’s like we’ve become so addicted to temporary highs and satisfaction, that we have no idea how to connect long term. 

So those are my musings today 😂 What are your thoughts and why do you think it’s so hard to develop meaningful friendships/connections in today’s society? 

What struggles have you faced when looking for friendships at this age? 

Do you think it is the internet’s fault and we’d be better off without it? ",5,1770553871.0,TheRealFriendsOver40,3,0.86,False

1qz7m91,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qz7m91,Digital Underground - Sex Packets (1990),"What’s good, Funkateers? I’m calling this Thirteen Days of ‘90s P. We won’t be rockin bells that go a-ding and a-dong, but a couple (literally, two) of y’all will recall the 51 Days of P-Funk I did like 6 weeks back. I had a good time so I’m back for more. Thirteen more. Chronological-ish.

In the 1990s, the Parliament-Funkadelic sound, the whole sub-genre, launched in all kinds of directions musically, lyrically, philosophically, technologically, all that. It would become a legacy thing with all kinds of unreleased shit dropping. It’d reboot with whole new albums rockin’ classic lineups. It would spin off jazz albums, New Jack, metal, hip hop. It would be sampled more or less legally and repurposed for a whole new brand of Funk. That’s what we’re about. Good? Let’s go.

Watch whatcha doin’. It’s 1990. We’re rhymin’ on the Funk. It’s Digital Underground and *Sex Packets* and the P will never be the same.

We’re talking samples now. In the liner notes for \*Sex Packets\* we got George and the Funk Mob given the credit and these tracks named: “Flashlight,” “Let’s Play House,” “Motor Booty Affair,” “Four Play,” “Dr. Funkenstein,” “Atomic Dog,” “Aqua Boogie,” “Pumpin’ It Up,” and “Bootzilla.”

It’s cool to go sample hunting on \*Sex Packets.\* We open with the classic that ya’ll know, “Humpty Dance,” the Parliament “Let’s Play House” sample throughout in the brass. I love the claps. Humpty’s voice and the backing vocals sort of fill stuff out. The P brings melody sneakily and the Digital Underground kids are on top of it. No doubt this is the iconic cut on the album. I won’t dwell on it.  It’s just the start anyhow.

“Rhymin’ on the Funk” is mostly Parliament’s “Flash Light.” A little bit “Pumpin’ It Up” by the All-Stars, too. It’s sparse though, man. The effects from “Pumpin” are louder than any groove. The riff is still there but it’s in and out. Distant in the verses. But when the break kicks in they’re throwing down a whole new way. And these cats dig the “Flashlight” groove. It’s everywhere. “Dowhatchyalike” is another one, but I like it for the “Atomic Dog” drums more. That electro-verging-on-New-Jack feels perfect with the vocal. When it draws out. It drives the track to my favorite thing in the world right now: \*This message has been brought to you by the makers of the way we swing…\* The cool is unmatched. \*Chase the cat!\* And the piano? Come on now… we’re off topic… aren’t we?

There’s plenty of other P, too. Let’s be quick with it: “Danger Zone” is “Flashlight” and “Bootzilla.” The strings are killer. “Sex Packets,” the title track, builds on the live cut of “Dr. Funkenstein” and tosses in some Prince riffs and \*DAMN\* the groove is thick now… that’s the one that sticks with me most to be honest. “Underwater Rime” leans heavily on the Herbie “Chameleon” sample but inside the “Aqua Boogie” beat. Super dope. Very smooth.

Plus, there’s plenty here that doesn’t stick solely to the P and still kills. “Gutfest ‘89” samples Ray Charles. “New Jazz” is entirely a Run DMC sample from what I can tell and it breaks up the album especially nicely. A little grittier. “The Way We Swing” too. That’s leading with the Jimi Hendrix sample, grittier, and the duo vocal they put on top makes more of that NYC 80s sound. Boom. You rhyme like a school teacha. These dudes are more than Sons of the P now. Right? Is this “P” because they use P samples or because they sample wild shit? \*They don’t know - they don’t know - they don’t know what I know.\*

Best proceed with an open mind now.

Anyway. The 90s P is upon us and it’s gonna come in all kinds of unexpected ways. Sometimes is chopped and screwed by someone else. Sometimes it’s straight right out of the Cosmic Slop. Sometimes it’s fuckin’ reggae. Or is that a werewolf? So. Until then, you deep sea gangstas and underwater prankstas. It’s gonna be a weird two weeks. Cool as shit. But weird.

What’s next? Is that your favorite song, darlin’? You gonna rock it all night long, darlin’?",19,1770553495.0,funk,2,0.91,False

Instagram is newly created [u/sugarandsweet28](https://www.reddit.com/user/sugarandsweet28/), and Snapchat sugarandsweet28  
  
I am looking for a legit sugar daddy. I'm not interested if you're not willing to show me how you look, hear your voice, and send pictures back. I want a real connection and arrangement. Need someone who can handle me. I have a witty mouth. Like to banter, but if it's disrespectful and degrading, move along, it's an instant mood killer for me - dirty talking is fine boundries will be discussed.  
  
I'm cautious of scammers and first want to connect and have normal conversations to see if I like you. Yep, you heard right. How dare a sugar baby make demands? This is the first time ""selling"" myself. I'm a corporate tycoon myself, just in a tough spot at the moment, but I won't need to be reliant on your finances forever. Getting to know you is a must for the arrangement before any sexual content is sent, a clear arrangement and boundaries prior.  
  
You need to be a friend with benefits, someone I like, because like I said. I would like it to turn into an emotional connection once I no longer need your money. To meet in-person only after I'm certain I won't become a murder doc or something along those lines. Wanting to connect, have fun, and just be free. I'm very careful and suspicious of scams. So if you are one don't even bother you won't get far because I know what I'm looking for - I'm a slut with standards and no amount of money will make me settle.  
Also needs to be a Dom. As you can see, I have a mouth and attitude on me that someone needs to dominate, and I'm cheeky about it too, which will give you some fight. If you're not a scam looking for something long term send me a message. Only looking for one exclusive sugar daddy. I'm also not interested in being with someone who likes to be dominated. I like to be dominated so respectfully stay away from my dms, money won't change my mind don't even try it. I basically need a friend who can enjoy my kinks and fantasies with.  
  
I am assertive and want you to prove to me why you should be my one and only sugar daddy. Tip my long message is an indication of how I like to talk. If you don't know how to keep a conversation flowing or too short with replies you can also consider yourself disqualified. Applications are open😉 only one spot. I'm a white female  
I'm a married 28 year old woman. Extremely new to this. I do have a story that I'll share with you.  
  
I'm interested in an online dynamic only. It can be as sexual as we want. I don't mind in person meetups as long as I know I'm safe.  
  
However in-person meetups - I prefer to only be platonic. We can flirt but no crossing the actual boundary. I want to be able to have fun, laugh enjoy the moment with someone who can banter, tease, compliment.  
  
Someone who enjoy a blooming sunflower girl whose eyes lid up when they see the little things in life. Whether it's a small butterfly or tasty coffee. Someone who can get lost staring at me being gleefully happy in the moment.  
  
No hubby doesn't know I'm here. I'm looking for someone who will also have normal convos with me - a balance.  
  
To make me laugh, blush and enjoy each other's company. I'm very picky and very careful. But once I have that solid foundation with someone I want it to be natural fun and safe.  
  
Emotionally and physically. If you're someone who degrades move along. I don't mind banter and dirty talk but I won't take the arrangement lightly as it's a big leap for me. It's my first time doing this. I'm cautious of suspicious requests. I need real and legit. And if I'm comfortable I'll let go with you online. And you'll see another side other that sweet and innocent.",1,1770553491.0,u_Sugar_and_Sweet,0,1.0,False
1qz7m4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qz7m4w/other_half_to_your_heart/,Other Half To Your Heart,"You held your index and middle finger out in a heart-shape towards me. I looked at you with suspicion for a split second, as I was unsure of your intention in doing so. *Ultimately, I obliged and matched your fingers with mine*. We are always so silly honestly, I love us (*you*) so much.

There was not much significance in this action but I hope this confirms for you that you will always be *the other half to my heart no matter what, my child*. I just want to pour my soul into you so badly at times but I don’t want to mess up our progress after we’ve come so far. 

I guess I should just be content that you hold such strong platonic love for me, right? I really do cherish every moment and memory we make together but you know I want more from you. I was even thinking of surprising you with a box of chocolates next weekend honestly as chocolate is the one thing I know you love more than myself lol. I would personally buy you some baby food too but only if I get to spoon-feed to you lol (*you’re so strange and I love it so much*). 

Things were going so well too but then you randomly brought up your ex to me just to rain on my parade (*thanks for that btw*). Maybe you were trying to express that you were feeling lonely in that moment but there’s other ways to convey that personally. You’ve broken my heart hundreds of times now and I will probably let you break it a hundred times more because I crave you like an addict craves their drugs sadly. 

*Yet you are probably the only thing I crave in the mornings more than my coffee if you hadn’t realized it yet*. Without you two, I feel like I am a hopeless wreck as you can tell. I need you to guide me so that I can be the best version of myself for you. So I can be someone worthy of claiming. *I really do want to be that someone you fantasize about when you are feeling lonely*. I know I was that person for you in the past and now we finally have a fresh start to try again so please don’t waste it being afraid. 

*Being your’s is all I want to be at the end of the day, beautiful*. For all intents and purposes, I already am but I don’t know how to express that to you without risking our relationship. I will continue to wait patiently for you in the meantime as you have given me no choice. *I just hope and pray you will match the other half to my heart when I hold it out to you the next time*…

Take care for now, my human squishy ball. I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing you next week no matter what happens. *I’ll be okay as long as I am blessed to see your beautiful face and shining smile*…

Love,

1qz7lsw,https://i.redd.it/xlz8cpyfk9ig1.jpeg,Effort Is Invisible Until Results Appear,"I’ve been there, sitting in a tiny room, staring at a slow laptop, cold coffee piling up like sad trophies, tabs multiplying like a virus, grinding on a project nobody seemed to notice. Months of late nights, revisions, failed prototypes, and yet, nothing. Meanwhile, social media is full of wins: diploma selfies, business launches, viral posts. And I mutter, “Is all this work invisible or am I just cursed?”

The world worships results. The final product gets applause. But the 3 a.m. edits, the hours of practice, the days you dragged yourself out of bed when you wanted to quit? Invisible. Effort stays hidden.

Think about it. The student who studies every night while friends party gets called “lucky” when they top the exam. The entrepreneur surviving on instant noodles while “overnight successes” get the hype. The musician practicing scales in the dark. The parent working double shifts so kids can have opportunities. Talent? Often just invisible effort finally showing up.

I’ve been that person, doubting every step, envying quick wins, almost quitting countless times. The invisible phase is soul-crushing. But that grind is doing its work quietly, like roots underground. Most people quit right before the breakthrough. That’s why success seems “instant” for some, it isn’t.

Effort compounds silently. The bloom, the diploma, the launch, the skill, comes later. Showing up when nobody sees you is the real test. When results appear, they’ll be yours, earned the hard way. The world will call it luck. You’ll know better. You’ll remember the nights of doubt, the failed attempts, the silent persistence, and quietly think, “It was worth it.”

The grind is frustrating. You’ll want to quit. You’ll scroll past highlight reels and wonder if it matters. But invisible effort is the real flex. Show up consistently, especially when no one’s watching. One day, the results will show up too. And when they do, you’ll smile, knowing the real win was refusing to stop.",1,1770553454.0,u_yeshuaxrpl,0,1.0,False
1qz7kvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarAnomalies/comments/1qz7kvm/why_my_morning_coffee_obsession_led_to_solar/,Why my morning coffee obsession led to solar panels,"Camping always meant going without real coffee, and I’d accepted that as part of the deal. Instant coffee or nothing, those were the options. Then my nephew showed up at our family camping trip with this weird contraption that looked like it belonged in a sci fi movie. It was a solar kettle. He set up these reflective panels, filled the container with water, and twenty minutes later we had boiling water for proper coffee. No fuel, no electricity, just sunlight. I was more fascinated by the device than the coffee, honestly.

Back home, I fell down this research rabbit hole about solar thermal technology. The basic physics was straightforward, but the practical engineering was clever. Reflective surfaces concentrated sun energy onto a small area, dramatically increasing temperatures. Performance depended on weather and sun angle, but for the right conditions, these things were legitimately useful.

The applications went way beyond camping convenience too. Developing regions without
reliable electricity could benefit hugely. Emergency preparedness kits could include these for disaster situations. The more I learned, the more possibilities I saw.

I started comparing different models, efficiency ratings, portability features. Some folded flat for
easy transport, others prioritized heating speed. The price range was all over the place. Found
options on Alibaba from budget to premium.

My nephew thought it was hilarious that I’d gotten so into this. What started as curiosity about his camping gadget turned into genuine interest in renewable energy applications. Now I’m that
person at parties talking about solar technology.",2,1770553374.0,SolarAnomalies,0,1.0,False
