We have always been very close but she (27f) tends to be flighty/caught up in her own life so I've had the attitude of ""take what she's willing to give and be happy for what we have"". I'd see her a few times a year and we'd pick up where we left off - usually with me sort of counseling her on her life/listening to her friend related drama because I'm boring and don't generally have drama to share. She has slept at my house countless times, shown up at 2am when she fights with her family, and canceled or cut short trips that we've had planned for months (that I usually pay the majority of expenses for) at the last minute. I generally pay for meals, grocery trips, etc because that's how I treat my family.

She was part of our wedding, which was a disaster due mostly to family drama, so our friend group decided that we should renew our vows with just the group this year. My friend was enthusiastic and on board. To make it worth it (we have higher income than most of our friends) we offered to pay for everyone's hotel room, and some of the activities there for us because I know what it takes to travel and we were appreciative.

Another friend of mine offered to take my to NY to go dress shopping over a weekend since I didn't have that experience the first time, and my best friend wanted to come. I was excited, though exhausted because I work two full time jobs, and thought we were having a blast on our trip. On Saturday night my best friend wanted to go clubbing, and my other friend and I were trashed -- she has a commute and I was really struggling to keep up with both jobs and travel planning for the vow renewal (and renovating our house that we just moved into.... Etc.) so I was honest about how I was feeling and told her that if she really wanted to go, I'd find a coffee and go. She said it was alright. I asked if she was sure, because i didn't want her to be disappointed and she said it was totally fine. So the rest of the weekend was chill and we talked and walked around the city and I loved it and left feeling like I had the best friends in the world.

Something else to note -- I was torn between two dresses and found out through one of the sellers that the he and the other sellers really hated each other. When I selected the other dress, I told the first guy that I had found another dress that I loved and really appreciated his time. This seemed vague enough to not cause drama between them and felt appropriate to me.

3 days later I get a call from my best friend saying that she needed to tell me the truth: she was very disappointed that we didn't go clubbing and she felt like she wasted her time and the trip was boring. I was a little taken aback but apologized because I didn't realize she felt that way. I asked her to be honest in the future so that I could accommodate her wishes and she said that was asking to much of her, to force her to drag me to places I didn't want to go. Not really knowing how to respond to that I told her to pick any weekend in the coming year and I'd take her back to NY on my dime to make it up to her. She said verbatim that her time was precious and she didn't want to waste more if it. The conversation ended and knowing she was emotional, I sent a text recapping what I said -- to be honest in the moment in the future because I care about her feelings and to pick a weekend.

This turned into a long series of texts from her saying that I was being unreasonable and she shouldn't have to ""spell it out in letters of fire"", that I should just know after all this time. I tried to explain that I can't read her mind but then she shifted, said she was not in fact mad about going clubbing and she was instead mad about the fact that I lie. I asked her for an example of these lies and she cited the response I gave to the dress seller, saying I should have just told him I went with the competitor shop. That seemed silly to me so I asked for more examples and she couldn't offer any.

At this point I'm confused and sad and I dont have many girl friends so I'm not used to this type of petty conflict so I start crying because I don't know what to do. My husband notices and being that she's his friend too he text her to tell her she's being selfish, that the weekend wasn't about her, and she should reconsider her behavior.

Well this set her off completely and I honestly don't even remember what she said besides sending me a long list of things she's ever done for me, which was even more hurtful because I provide for her without any expectations. The transactional nature of her view of our relationship hurt.

I tried to get her to meet me to talk in person multiple times. She refused but after months agreed to a video call. I listened to her side without interrupting and tried to understand her perspective -- genuinely I didn't but offered apologies for anything I did that hurt her feelings. When it came to be my turn to talk she dismissed me, rolled her eyes, told me I was wrong and constantly interrupted me. I told her this and that I didn't feel respected but she didn't stop.

We ended the call with her saying she ""didn't want me to be sad"" so she would make arrangements to be at our vie renewal. 3 days before the renewal, after I had paid for her things, I had to ask if she was coming and she said no.

I feel like I've done all I can here but tell me please -- is there something else I'm missing??? I don't have the energy or capacity for this kind of drama, I need people who can resolve conflict like adults and I just don't feel like she can.

Narratives about the journey, to which undoubtedly belongs the film-journey ""A Wind Named Amnesia"", in European and world art, as a rule, carry a symbolic meaning, often being philosophical parables. ""Amnesia"" also claims to hold symbolic meaning. The author of the story, Kikuchi Hideyuki, borrowed the idea from the American science fiction novel of the 1930s ""Rebirth"" by Thomas McClary and endowed there Japanese protagonist as well as some of his own ideas. Even the names are symbolic in this anime, as well as encounters during the journey and some narrative elements that Kikuchi Hideyuki later used in his other works.

https://preview.redd.it/berl2wyy00be1.jpg?width=1447&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdae6ed4c3fc9266a418a50b96852a371a75620b

The plot of the anime is rather ominous - a mysterious wind swept over the earth and took with it all the memory of mankind. This wind was so weird that it caused not only amnesia, but also deprived people of the verbal-logical, emotional and even motor memory responsible for the interaction and control of the mechanisms created by people. In a strange way it did not deprive peopleof of that part of the motor memory which is responsible for the ability to walk or to use clothes. In general, the wind named Amnesia clearly was not a simpleton and had something specifically against the achievements of human civilization, including the ability to speak. One such memoryless person is the as-yet-unnamed anime protagonist, wandering aimlessly through post-apocalyptic America. In the process of his wanderings, our hero meets a boy Johnny, incapacitated teenager who has not lost his memory and the ability to speak. As it turned out, as a result of the experiment, Johnny's brain functioned like a computer, and therefore the wind named Amnesia did not affect Johnny's memory. With the help of a learning machine, Johnny returns to the protagonist the ability to speak and the memory of human civilization, and then teaches him to drive a car (it is not clear, however, how a thirteen-year-old boy unable to walk acquired this skill himself and passed it on to the main character), shoot a pistol, ""read"" stars, find edible plants and other skills necessary for survival in the post-apocalyptic world. Johnny also identified the protagonist as a Japanese, gave him the name ""Wataru"", which can be translated as a wanderer or a vagabond, and deceived Wataru about his age. Since Johnny was a ""remnant"" of human civilization, which means that he was subject to ""oblivion"", having completed his small educational mission, he shares the fate of civilization - he dies. But before his death, he gives Wataru instruction, saying that humanity is now reduced to its true self and that Wataru has the duty to investigate this human essence in its purest form and revive humanity.

https://preview.redd.it/uw3lzkz610be1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=df22b359c7eaf7901e24bd3be04d6a673fa4f3dc

Thus begins the journey of Wataru - riding his Jeep, Wataru ends up in San Francisco, where he encounters a police robot, the operator of which has long been dead, but the machine is still wandering around the city with a skeleton in the cockpit, demanding submission from people and killing them. The mysterious white-haired beauty Sophia helps Wataru to defeat the robot using telepathy to point out the weak point of the machine. Sophia is not only beautiful, but also knows how to speak, knows what she should not know, has the ability to telepathy and looks at the world in a detached and judicious way. The name Sophia is translated from Greek as ""wisdom"", which is also an attribute of God in Christianity and even an independent ""deity"" in Gnosticism. Philosophical journey is indispensable without wisdom. Therefore, having united with Wisdom, that is, with Sophia, the Wanderer (Wataru) continues his journey in order to understand humanity. The heroes come to Los Angeles and save the girl named Sue from being sacrificed to the local ""deity"". The ""deity"" turns out to be a giant construction machine, which one of the locals somehow learned to control and created a bloodthirsty cult with the help of the machine. In general, again, the remnant of civilization showed its ""wickedness"" in the form of a killer machine that suppresses people. Sue, with a tenacity worthy of a better use, refuses to be saved from the sacrifice, and Watar is forced to destroy the ""evil remnant of civilization.""Slightly revealing her essence, Sofia makes a remark that the locals follow their own rules, which they will not refuse and Wataru should not interfere in all this, but allow new cultures to develop in their own way. Sofia then makes a bet with Wataru that they won't meet people on their journey who will join them. The stake in the bet is the return of memory to mankind.

But civilization strikes back - a police robot from San Francisco crawls into the workshop, repairs and even improves itself (any coffee maker is capable of this, if you didn't know). It also becomes obsessed with the manic idea of finding and destroying Wataru . This very robot is ambushing our heroes, and they are barely able to escape, ending up in the ""perfect city"" - an utopia where everything is run by a supercomputer that has turned the only surviving people into its puppets, which play different, prescribed roles, simulating social life. People, refusing to follow the rules set by the computer, were murdered. The computer also wants to enslave Wataru and Sofia, but the latter, as you might have guessed, is not quite a human being and therefore the intrigues of the supercomputer are not an obstacle for her. However, the locals are satisfied with their life according to the rules and under the protection of a supercomputer, clinging to the memories of a past life and refusing to leave the utopian city with the Wanderer and Wisdom.

Wataru and Sophia continue their journey together and the latter reveals to our hero that she is an alien and it was her people who deprived humanity of memory solely pursuing good intentions. That is after telling Wataru that he should not interfere with the development of emerging cultures from his belfry of a destroyed civilization (let them do what they want, including human sacrifices and emslavement by a computer), she somehow does not notice that her fellow tribesmen intervened in the fate of mankind much more radically. Since Sofia's destination of New York has already been reached and no one has joined them yet, Wataru loses the bet and prepares to part ways with his companion. However, they are again overtaken by an indefatigable robot-maniac from San Francisco and Wataru declares that he must once and for all put an end to what mankind has created - to finish off civilization embodied in this robot. Moreover, he must do this on his own, which, as it were, hints at the fact that he agrees with what Sophia and her fellow tribesmen done to humanity and will not “take the path of civilization”, but will destroy it himself, with all the proletarian fury: “We will destroy the whole world of violence. To the foundation, and then. We will build our new world. He who was nothing will become everything! "". Finally, the remnants of the ""evil civilization"" are destroyed by the hands of the last civilized man. Wataru then woke up on his companion's lap. For exploits in the destruction of civilization, the beautiful Sophia, whom Wataru has been looking at all the time, ""rewards him with an earthly gift"" - gives the protagonist her body - to the music of Bach and with the background depicting Madonna with the baby Jesus, Wataru sucks the nipples of naked Sophia. Apparently, in such a simple way, imbibing ""wisdom"" from her breasts. This is how our Wanderer ""fell in love"" with Wisdom (Sophia), that is, he literally became philo (to love)-sopher (wisdom), a Wisdom Lover. And the task of the philosopher, as you know, is ""anamnanesis"" - the return to people of the wisdom they have forgotten, which is what our newborn Wisdom Lover is called to do. The background on which the copulation takes place, depicting the Madonna with the Christ child, apparently also should symbolize that the new ""Virgin Mary"" (Sophia) gives birth to the one who is called to renew humanity (Wataru).

Throughout the film, one and the same idea can be traced, repeated in different ""meetings"" experienced by Wataru and Sofia on their journey - the hero and people in general are opposed by the achievements of human civilization, the creations of man, who have turned into oppressors of their creators. This is a police robot that demands obedience from people and kills them, a giant excavator that sacrifices people, a supercomputer that enslaves people and turns them into their weak-willed puppets. It is the ""suppression and exploitation"" by the civilization of the people who created it that allegedly serves as the reason that the aliens decided to ""save humanity"" by depriving it of memory.

Such ideas about civilization as an evil that suppresses humanity are old and uncomplicated. Of course, we are not talking about some kind of ""evil / good"" aliens who are supposed to ""save"" humanity, relieving it from the ""burden"" of civilization. It's about the people themselves. It was not in vain that I quoted lines from the Internationale above. There was once such a utopian socialist Léger-Marie Deschamps, who wrote that “the state of laws for us, people in a civil state, is undeniably worse than in a state of savagery ... Evil in a person takes place only thanks to the existing civil state, which infinitely contrary to his nature. There was no such evil in man in the herd state."" In order to get rid of the evils of civilization and bring people to a ""blissful state"", according to Deschamps, not only the fine arts - poetry, painting or architecture, but also science and technology, literacy and writing, must disappear, all books must be burned, and man must be brought down to the state of livestock (after all, you can’t argue that a cow peacefully chewing grass on the lawn, not knowing its fate, is happier in its own way than a person burdened with many worries and fears?).

Deschamps is echoed by the pervert old man Freud, who built his concept of the layers of the human psyche by analogy with the Maxist theory of the division and oppression of some social classes by others. He argued that layers of the psyche created under the influence of civilization suppress and exploit the ""wild"" layer of the psyche, which boils down to sexuality and the ""principle of pleasure"", and thus civilization deprives humanity of ""happiness"". Apparently, that's why Sophia ""gives"" Wataru, who has abandoned civilization, sex with her, as ""the highest gift of mankind."" By the way, Kikuchi Hideyuki later develops this ""theme"" in the ""Wicked City"", where the culmination is the copulation of the heroes in the church, under the statue of the Virgin Mary. Just as in ""Amnesia"", a man here copulates with a non-human woman (a demoness), and their child is called to ""save the world."" At the same time, there Kikuchi goes even further, opposing the new ""Madonna"" - the demoness to the Virgin Mary. If Mary is immaculate, then the demoness is the embodiment of depravity - in the course of the plot, she is raped by everyone except by the lazy, and in the most perverted ways. And judging by what was shown she did enjoy it. It is from the statue of the Virgin Mary, declared an ""enemy"" by the old man, that a monster breaks out, attacking the protagonists. Well, the child of the demon, according to Christianity, is the Antichrist - so the viewer should not be misled by the Christian symbolism depicted in both cases - it is here desacralized and abolished with all the socialist passion of theomachism, with the proposal of new images of ""salvation of mankind"".

The socialist ideas of Deschamps, Marx and Freud develop within the framework of neo-Freudianism and neo-Marxism. Marcuse, for example, proposes the ""liberation"" of the libido by getting rid of the control of the ""repressive mind"" and the destruction of social institutions. In contemporary art, these ideas are expressed in the fight against ""repressive"" and ""suffocating"" culture by creating anti-aesthetic things, images of garbage and excrement, designed to overcome the ""discrimination"" of the disgusting, liberation of the ""suppressed instincts."" And in ""Amnesia"" we have computers and machines that oppress and enslave humanity.

In general, it is not the insidious aliens that should be feared, but the representatives of humanity prone to nihilism. Well, the anime itself should be renamed ""The Wind Called Nihilism"". In addition to the primitive ideological content, ""Amnesia"" is also a rather long and boring anime. Pleasant except that the drawing of the ""old school"" of the 1980s and the musical accompaniment. And for once, the Japanese decently portrayed the young woman's breasts (Sofia), which in itself is close to uniqueness. The narrative itself, as noted above, is rather lengthy, but fans of road movies and parable films may find it meditative. And the very attempt to make anime filled with meaning (not simply imitating it), albeit with controversial, if not insane ideas, is a rather rare phenomenon now. So with all the caveats, Amnesia deserves an above-average rating.

1htheni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1htheni/uncontrollable_shaking_after_laying_down_to_sleep/,Uncontrollable shaking after laying down to sleep,"Last night around 1am, I (35M, 5'8 160lbs) felt a tremor start and then progressively increase. Within about 5 minutes I was full on shaking, teeth chattering. I sat up and my wife got me Gatorade, which was difficult to drink without a straw.

Checked my heart rate, it wasn't elevated at 75.

Blood sugar was 91 (it was hard to get blood draw from my fingers)

No nausea

Appearance normal, not flushed or anything

Breathing was normal

Thermometer registered 97.7, I didn't feel cold or hot

I am a little under the weather with a sore throat, but, nothing terrible 


The shaking lasted for maybe 15-20 minutes. I was able to slow it down by breathing deeply, but, it was mostly involuntary.

The key thing that might have influenced this was, I got a cortado at about 8pm. It was after dinner, so not on an empty stomach. I typically just have a coffee in the morning, and a cortado is 3 shots of espresso.

However, this wasn't the first time this shaking has happened. It's probably been about 5 years since the last time, but over the last decade or so it's definitely happened at least a half dozen times. The common link before was eating a lot of Mexican food, I believe.

I have a video of me shaking, should I see if my doctor will take a look at it? Or does this seem like standard caffeine jitters.",1,1736006401.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

**Put the jars into the pressure cooker and the bag on top of the jars. If you use only bags you need to use a steamer basket to elevate it off the water in your pressure cooker.**

**If you accomplish pressure cooking you hydrate with no leftover water in your bag or in your jar you can pressure cook it for 45 minutes and then you're done. Just allow the pressure cooker to get rid of the steam and pressure on its own don't try and force out the steam let it naturally come out.**


**So whenever you use an autoclavable bag you need a steamer basket or jars to elevate the plastic off the water. The plastic will melt if it's in water.**

1hthcnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/postapocalyptic/comments/1hthcnu/is_this_a_good_story_or_not/,is this a good story or not,"I woke up early, as I usually did. The faint sound of birds chirping outside filtered through the single-paned windows of my modest house in Miami. I had bought the house a year ago, a quaint little one-story place with pale blue walls and white trim. It wasn’t much, but it was mine. I had saved every penny from my job at Publix to make it happen.

For a 17-year-old, owning a house and a car was unheard of, but being immortal came with its perks. I had centuries of financial knowledge and a knack for saving money. My coworkers, most of them older than me, didn’t know this about me. To them, I was just a hardworking teenager trying to make ends meet. They didn’t know about the centuries of history I’d lived through, or the countless pandemics I’d witnessed. This one, however, felt different—almost scripted, like a bad episode of *The Walking Dead* where every character makes the worst decision possible.

I worked as a stocker at Publix—the night shift. The job wasn’t glamorous, but it paid $14 an hour, and the hours were steady. My coworkers were a mixed bag. Some were friendly, like Sarah, the middle-aged cashier who always had a joke to share, or Miguel, the night manager who always had my back. Others were less kind. There was Ryan, a guy in his late 20s who seemed to enjoy bossing people around despite not being in charge. I kept my head down and focused on the work, knowing I could walk away from it all whenever I wanted.

My car was a 2010 Honda Civic. It wasn’t flashy, but it was reliable. I’d bought it used for $6,000 after months of saving. The Civic was silver, with a few scratches along the sides from the previous owner, but the engine purred like a dream. I’d taken good care of it, regularly changing the oil and keeping it clean. The Civic’s interior smelled faintly of vanilla—a result of the air fresheners I kept dangling from the rearview mirror.

I usually refueled at the Shell station down the road. It was convenient, just a five-minute drive from my house. If that wasn’t an option, I’d head to the BP near Coral Way. It was slightly more expensive, but it got the job done.

I liked to think of my Civic as the kind of car a supporting character in *Shaun of the Dead* would drive—serviceable, but not particularly exciting. It’s the car you’d see in the background as the main characters steal something flashier to escape the undead.

My house was small but cozy. The front door opened into a modest living room with a worn gray couch and a flat-screen TV mounted on the wall. A coffee table sat in front of the couch, cluttered with old magazines, a couple of books on history, and a remote control. To the right was the kitchen, a compact space with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances. Inside the fridge, I kept a mix of essentials and indulgences: milk, eggs, bread, a six-pack of Coca-Cola, a pack of string cheese, leftover pizza from the night before, and a box of strawberries. The pantry held ramen, cereal, and snacks like Doritos and granola bars.

The house had two bedrooms. My room was simple: a twin bed with navy blue sheets, a wooden desk covered in notebooks and an aging laptop, and a small closet that held my modest wardrobe. The second bedroom was empty, a space I hadn’t figured out how to use yet. The bathroom was functional, with white tiles and a shower curtain patterned with palm trees. In hindsight, the place screamed ""first location to be overrun by zombies.""

The night before, I had celebrated New Year’s Eve with a few friends. We’d gathered in the backyard, eating pizza and lighting sparklers. As the clock struck midnight, fireworks lit up the Miami skyline, their explosions blending with the cheers from neighbors and the faint sounds of music drifting through the humid night air.

When I woke up, it was just another morning. I made myself a bowl of cereal and sat in the living room, the TV flickering on to CNN. The headline caught my eye immediately: **“Virus Outbreak Reported in Miami”.**

I stopped mid-bite, the spoon hanging in the air. The news anchor’s voice was calm but serious, detailing how a mysterious virus had been reported at several hospitals across the city. Footage played of overcrowded ERs, with people thrashing and screaming as medical staff struggled to contain them.

My phone buzzed on the coffee table, notifications from Twitter and Instagram lighting up the screen. Social media was exploding with posts about the outbreak. Videos showed people on the streets, their eyes wild, attacking others with a ferocity that sent chills down my spine. The captions read: **“Stay indoors. Don’t go outside.”**

“Great,” I muttered to myself. “First day of the year, and we’re already in a George A. Romero knockoff.”

I turned off the TV and sat in silence for a moment. My immortal body was immune to disease, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t affected by the chaos around me. I got dressed in jeans and a plain black T-shirt, laced up my sneakers, and grabbed my car keys. I still had to go to work. Immortal or not, Publix didn’t pay me to stay home.

The streets were eerily quiet. Normally, the morning traffic in Miami was a headache, but today there were only a handful of cars on the road. As I drove past familiar landmarks—the pastel-colored Art Deco buildings of South Beach, the busy intersections near Brickell—I noticed an unsettling change. Some storefronts were boarded up, while others had been abandoned entirely.

At one point, I passed a man standing in the middle of the road. He was pale, his clothes torn, with a vacant look in his eyes. He stumbled toward my car, and I couldn’t help but think, *Wow, it’s like someone went full Capcom on this guy*. I swerved around him and kept driving, the image sticking in my mind like a scene from *Resident Evil*.

Miguel had become my closest ally as the city descended into chaos. He was resourceful and level-headed, qualities that made him invaluable in a world where the old rules no longer applied.

As we barricaded ourselves in my house, Miguel and I started comparing notes on zombie tropes. “So, fast zombies or slow zombies?” he asked, hammering a board over the living room window.

“Fast,” I replied. “Like in *28 Days Later*. These things sprint. No shuffling like *Night of the Living Dead*.”

“Great,” Miguel said sarcastically. “Guess cardio really is king.”

We turned the empty bedroom into a supply room, stacking food and water against the walls. The kitchen became our command center, with maps spread across the table as we planned our next moves. Occasionally, we’d mock the absurdity of our situation.

“You ever notice how nobody in zombie movies just tries staying in a supermarket?” Miguel said one night.

“Yeah, because that’d make too much sense,” I replied. “Instead, let’s all cram into a dark farmhouse with no exits.”

Without laws or regulations, humanity’s darker instincts came to the forefront. Small groups of survivors banded together, some forming communities while others became raiders, preying on the weak.

Miguel and I encountered one such group—a self-proclaimed “zombie resistance” led by a guy who called himself ""General Romero."" His uniform consisted of camo pants and a *World War Z* T-shirt, and his grand strategy for defeating the infected was “to think like a zombie.” It didn’t end well for him.

One day, we heard a broadcast on an old radio: a message from a group claiming to have established a safe zone near Fort Lauderdale. “It’s like the CDC camp in *Zombieland*,” Miguel joked.

“Yeah, and we all know how that turned out,” I said. Still, we packed for the journey. The world may have become a parody of itself, but survival was no joke.",1,1736006252.0,postapocalyptic,0,1.0,False

Here's how parallel policy validation can help your LLMs stay witty but appropriate...

I built a humor validator using the \`Must\` handler in the minds LLM toolkit (github.com/chriscow/minds). It runs multiple content checks in parallel - if any check fails, the others are canceled and the first error is returned.

The beauty here is parallel efficiency - all checks run simultaneously. The moment any policy fails (too many dad jokes!), the Must handler cancels the others and returns the first error.

This pattern is perfect for:

\- Content moderation with multiple rules

\- Validating inputs against multiple criteria

\- Ensuring all necessary preconditions are met

\- Running security checks in parallel

By composing these handlers, you can build sophisticated validation pipelines that are both efficient and maintainable. 

Check out [github.com/chriscow/minds](http://github.com/chriscow/minds) for the full example, plus more patterns like this one.

For two years straight I’ve been having bizarre presyncope spells and debilitating anxiety. I was given Lexapro for the anxiety in January 2022 and the symptoms went away entirely besides flutters and palpitations, but I’d rather have those than almost-fainting spells. In July this year I stupidly tapered off the Lexapro to live life unmedicated and was met with the consequences. Presyncope came back with a vengeance and made my life debilitating again. In October this year I started the Lexapro again but it hasn’t stopped these symptoms. I’ve been in and out of the ER for months because of this and they never find anything! 

I played sports my entire life. Was in the Army for a few years. Never had an issue with this until I was with child, who I inevitably lost to stillbirth and continued to miscarry more and that’s when my health and mental state began to spiral. No one could answer why, either. 

2 heart monitors in two years, no alarming results. Currently have a 30 day event monitor on, and my cardiologist had me get an echocardiogram on 12/30, and it showed that I have mild mitral valve prolapse, regurgitation, and was told that “it’s no big deal” and to keep regular appointments. 

I’ve been going BONKERS for days over this. How could they just brush it off if I’ve been having these presyncope spells for two years on and off? The flutters are daily. I just quit coffee, weed, and working on quitting cigarettes. I don’t drink alcohol. I’m not that active but I’m not a couch potato. I eat healthy. I drink water. Meditate. Stretch. All I can do now is pray. 

I can barely hide how terrified I am. My blood pressure bottoms out when the spells happen and I immediately have to evacuate my bowels, lay down, and sob. It doesn’t just do it at home anymore. It doesn’t matter where I am anymore. I can’t stop it, and I’m losing my mind over my mortality. 

I’m not asking for answers, but I’m asking for recommendations and kind support. I can’t have children, I can’t have a job, I can’t do anything but open my eyes and hope for a good day. I always thought it was panic attacks, and it very well could be, but what’s the difference between panic attacks and MVP at this point if I can’t tell them apart and the ER/cardiologist isn’t doing anything productive for me? The VA is a joke and will just throw pills at me or throw me through a million appointments with people I don’t need to see and make my life revolve around appointments. Advocating for myself is a one-man battle with a 50/50 chance of winning an appointment where I need to go. 

I’m freaking out. Totally. And was also told I have Pelvic Congestion Syndrome via transvag ultrasound on 12/30 also. Is that related?? WHO KNOWS. THEY WONT TELL ME ANYTHING.

Even when they come to my house they look in my closets and snope around.  They drink tons of soda with sugar and caffeine but i'm a devil cause I drink coffee which is a health drink compared to them drinking a six pack of Mountain Dew every day.  

They are so smug and put their nose up in the air all the time and it's just so annoying",4,1736005693.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False
1hth4xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hth4xg/is_there_enough_to_believe_he_likes_me_as_more/,Is there enough to believe he likes me as more than just a friend or am I just overthinking?,"We’re both in uni, and before, we would just study together. He’s said stuff like how much he values my opinions and I’m also intellectually attracted to him (he’s a very thoughtful person), we’ve both expressed that we feel we get each other a lot and are really grateful for each other, he always asks me how my day was, and he was the first to wish me a happy birthday this week. He’s just a really kind person overall. Just for context, we haven’t known each other very long (only 4 months), but to me, it feels like it’s been so much longer.

I think the first sign I got was when there was a multiple-choice quiz we totally could’ve done over a short phone call, but he asked if I wanted to come over to the study area at his apt instead, which was totally unnecessary, and then we did 10 minutes of the quiz and then talked for 3 hours about really deep stuff instead. Then he walked me home b/c I was worried about it being dark.

It’s been the same for a bunch more study sessions. We’d get coffee together, share personal things with each other, affirm each other, celebrate each other’s wins, and we went through finals stress together. But all of these could just be what a good friend does. And he calls me his friend.

After the semester ended, he’s stayed in touch. He’d been trying to get me to read more, so he asked if I wanted to do a buddy read over break with him (the first non school/class-related thing we’ve done) and ofc I said yes, but now he’s having problems with following through on the reading. But on a recent call, I was talking about chess and go, and he said he’d be in town soon and that he could teach me go if I wanted, and he suggested we meet up at a coffee shop to play. Is this him asking me out, or…?

Then on new year’s, I wished him happy new year first, and he replied saying the same plus, “I’m so glad I met you in my 2024, and i’m so excited to be going into 2025 with you too!!!” Am I reading too much into it?

The problem is, this could all still just be platonic, right?? Or am I being unreasonable? And on top of that, what makes me doubt more is that I’ve noticed that he is really nice to every other girl as well. Like I used to think maybe the way he’d look really happy to see me was unique, but now, I’ve seen him greet a ton of other girls he knows with the same warmth and also asks them how their day was. Ofc I’m glad he’s a kind person, but also, I hate how this makes me feel haha. Like what if he treats multiple other girls like this too and this isn’t special?

What should I do? I like him so darn much the question is just driving me crazy so much so that I’m typing this out at 3 am in the morning hah. I literally can’t sleep at night over this lol. Is there enough substance here to know that he likes me? Is there still a chance he doesn’t like me? And if he does, why doesn’t he just tell me? And I would tell him first, except I’m not confident enough to do it. :’) I don’t want to be delusional, but I can’t judge objectively when I’m involved in the situation help",1,1736005650.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I ‘assumed’ that since it’s cold that not much would happen in the pond (which I’ve had for a little under 10 years). Well… about a week ago while making coffee in my kitchen I peeked out of my window and saw some strange movement in the pond. I went out to check on it and saw a couple of my koi floating on the surface (on their sides), twitching (but only very little… maybe a little twitch every 30 seconds or so). Then I noticed that the pump wasn’t working. There was no air exchange! BUT I was somehow able to save them. I moved them around the pond with a hockey stick blade to get some oxygen flowing through their gills. I rushed and got the pump reconnected, then put them right under the waterfall. The flow of the water luckily kept them in place. They slowly started moving again. About an hour or two later? It was like nothing ever happened. They are fine now - but that experience REALLY sucked. Check your ponds every day! That’s my advice.",3,1736005633.0,Koi,1,1.0,False

I’ve set OKRs to guide my work priorities at a high level, am using a combination of GTD and Bullet Journaling to guide my day to day work, and am using the Pomodoro technique to maximize focus and productivity at my desk. 

It’s going great. Productivity is up, stress is down, I’m sleeping better than I have for years, and I’m finding I have time and energy for so much more outside of work.

For 2025 I’ve decided to add habit tracking to my Bullet Journal, and was surprised to hit a stumbling block. I started off with a brainstorming exercise, imagining what an ideal day would include. I split it into three areas of focus: work, health, and family. 

Daily work habits were easy: do a morning review to block out my day; empty my inbox; leave my desk clean at the end of the day.

Daily health habits were also easy: hydrate before coffee; back rehab exercises; cardio or calisthenics.

But when it came time for family, I struggled. Putting down daily chores felt like a cop out, and I don’t really need to track those anyway. I wanted something more substantive. So I tried to take a step back and think about family goals, and I also came up empty. 

I’m a great dad (I’m the primary parent most of the time and put the kids before everything else) and a good husband. But apparently I’m just sort of in cruise control, happy with how things are going but not really trying to improve anything. This feels wrong, since I’m always striving to set goals for myself and my work… why should family life not have prioritized habits and goals too?

So… I’m just looking for ideas and examples that might help me trigger some brainstorming. People who do a lot of habit tracking and goal setting, what sorts of habits and goals do you have for your family life?",1,1736005544.0,Habits,0,1.0,False

I’m 31M, and for the last 2+ years, my life has been stuck in this arranged marriage nonsense. Har mahine, 1-2 Sundays are booked for meeting some random girl, and it’s always the same story. We match, we chat, we meet, aur kuch hota hi nahi!

Kabhi ladki mujhe reject karti hai, kabhi I have to reject her. And when finally the girl and I are on the same page, our parents step in and say no. Ab toh bas ek boring routine ban gaya hai.

You know what’s worse? Some girls connect, chat for a bit, and then poof—disappear. Kabhi toh lagta hai ki things are positive after meeting, but a few weeks later, rejection aa jata hai without any reason. Aur jab mom and dad told me to compromise—like agreeing to a divorced girl, someone 5 years older, or even a girl I wasn’t attracted to—I still said okay. Par tab bhi rejection mila. Matlab mai itna bura hoon kya?

Upar se, all my relatives and well-wishers keep asking, “Shaadi kab kar rahe ho?” Matlab, kya karoon? Ghar ke bahar poster lagao? Every time they ask, I tell them, “Agar koi ladki pata hai toh batao.” But nobody does anything. Sab bas bolte rehte hain, advice dete hain, but help? Zero.

Sometimes I feel like life would have been easier if I had found love in college or my 20s. At least I wouldn’t be stuck in this boring, irritating process.

And don’t even get me started on my family. My parents are 65+ now. They’re getting old and can’t put in much effort anymore. Plus, their expectations and mine are worlds apart. My elder sisters? Hah. All they do is give advice and keep asking, “Kidhar baat bani?” When I tell them to help, they say they’re too busy with their kids and lives.

And as if this wasn’t enough, we keep hearing these crazy horror stories—like what happened with Atul Subhash and Puneet Khurana. It’s scary, yaar. This whole process is not just exhausting, it’s stressful.

Even my community isn’t helpful. Most girls in my community want NRIs or boys from the US. And the aunty-uncle matchmaking system, jo pehle kaam karta tha, that’s dead now. Divorce cases in the community have increased, so they’ve stopped helping. All I’m left with is matrimony apps, which honestly feel like a joke now.

It’s even affecting my work. I’m not hitting my targets because instead of recharging on Sundays, I’m busy meeting families or having awkward coffee dates.

And I’m just tired, yaar. I want to get married—I really do. I want a partner to share life with, go on trips with, and build memories. But this process? It’s making me feel hopeless.

I’m seriously thinking of deleting all my matrimony profiles. Sundays should be for me—Netflix, sleeping, long drives. Maybe if I stop trying so hard, something will happen naturally.

Reddit, kya lagta hai? Am I wrong for wanting to pause this circus? Should I keep trying, or just focus on myself for now? Agar kisi ke paas koi idea ya experience ho, please share. ",5,1736005523.0,Arrangedmarriage,5,1.0,False

Understanding Teeth Discoloration

Before diving into whitening solutions, it's essential to understand what causes tooth discoloration. Several factors contribute to yellowing or staining:

1. Dietary Habits
- Coffee and tea consumption
- Red wine
- Dark-colored berries
- Tobacco use

2. Age-Related Factors
As we age, tooth enamel naturally becomes thinner, revealing the yellowish dentin underneath. This process makes teeth appear less white and more dull over time.

Recently moved within Los Angeles and the South Bay. But I don't have much community here (most of my friends are further North or East). And community is everything (empirically and to me). So hoping to find men who are looking to build (or nurture) relationships in the South Bay. How?

**Walking and talking.** We'll grab coffee once a week and take a nice rejuvenating walk on the beach, discussing whatever is on our mind. The purpose?

1. To give men a non judgmental space to talk about what's going on for us. 
2. To open the door to a community of local friendships with men in a world that often makes that difficult to find/maintain.

[Cigna](https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-in-america) and other major organizations regularly share research confirming that over 50% of people in the US feel ""sometimes or always alone."" Such levels of isolation can have health impacts equal to smoking. Lonely people face higher levels of heart disease, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, cancer and so on. Many men struggle with loneliness ever as we are busy working, caring for our kids, dealing with the daily demands of life. But research shows that men with a robust circle of friendships live longer healthier lives, have better marriages/relationships, feel more optimistic and are more successful in our personal and professional lives. 

A few disclaimers:

1. This is not a religious or politically affiliated group.
2. What men share in the group is private.

The conversations will go where they go depending on the needs of each man. 

As far as me, my name is Jonathan. I'm 35, a New York transplant, marketing founder, in a childless relationship, and an avid traveler. I also do a lot of work in men's spaces and sit on the board of A Call to Men (to be clear, they are in no way involved in this concept nor is this a recruitment function of any time).

There's no set date for the first walk. Mostly want to see who is interested first. If I can get five men to raise their hand, we'll give this a shot. **If you'd like to join us, send me an email to** [**Jonathan@JonathanJacobs.com**](mailto:Jonathan@JonathanJacobs.com)**. Hope to hear from ya!**

1htgygn,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1htgygn/why_is_starbucks_so_pathetic/,Why is Starbucks so pathetic?,"I am not an elitist by any means, but I do like having good coffee and don't mind paying a premium for the cafes & baristas that put in the effort to give us a good cup.

With that context, I received a Starbucks ""$3 for any handcrafted beverage"" promo in my email a few days ago. While I have historically tried to avoid Starbucks because 1) They are damn expensive relative to mom&pop cafes (I am based out of NYC) 2) Their coffee was quite bitter (I partially thought it was my fault for going with dark roast). So with a half-off coupon, I thought of trying out a blonde roast flat-white.

I visit my neighborhood Starbucks, which is packed and loud as hell and has no seating space. Thinking of ordering my coffee-to-go (doesn't matter because they serve dine-in orders in paper cups too), I tell the cashier to give me a flat-white $7.65 down to $3.29 - Fairly simple at this point.

The Barista, who was quite polite and cheerful actually, proceeds to place a paper cup under a machine and pressed a button to dose 3 shots of espresso supposedly (I didn't see him grind beans despite having grinders in the back). Then, he proceeded to steam milk and dumped it into the cup - No attempting latte art or anything of that sort (I didn't even know if the espresso had any crema) - and put a lid saying my flat white is ready.

At this point I have no reactions but to temper my expectations. I proceeded to sip the coffee expecting it to be bitter - But it was hardly bitter. In fact, it felt like it hardly had any coffee at all and that I was drinking steamed milk. In my quest for a non-bitter flat white, they gave me a ""wet"" latte with extra milk. And despite searching high and low, I could find no sign of any crema or microfoam.

After this experience, I wonder how Starbucks manages to be so pathetic when it comes to making coffee. And more so, why do people crowd it in hordes when you can find better cafes that provide wifi, seating space, ceramic cups, great coffee, all at the same price.

Sorry for the rant but no one should have to go through this experience - Just a warning to all of you that may one day be tempted to switch from your neighborhood cafe to Starbucks and waste $3 that could be used for a much better coffee at a mom&pop shop.

(5'7 female , 30years old)

Water fasting -23hrs rolling into:
Water fasting - 37 hours

Surprised myself on this one! 
On January first I weighed myself to find my progress from gym and healthy(ish) eating disappeared after 2 years of taking it seriously. I had a stressful 4 months, fell back into skipping workouts/not tracking my food etc. gained 25.4 lbs of just pure fat.

January first I decided no more, and to take everything more serious. I created a new meal plan, fitness regime, and seen it was going to take me until June/july to see the results I wanted. 

I have ADHD , im an all or nothing type person. And when I get my head set on something I usually cannot stop thinking about it. I didn't want to wait until June. I wanted to feel like myself now. I am super unhappy and avoiding social interaction because of it. 

That ""fall"" after everyone knows you were taking health seriously is embarrassing I guess. I was looking fit, happy, confident, and now i just look fat. My double chin especially just came out of friggin no where. I don't even like laughing right now. I just don't feel like myself. 

I decided to look into something I hated on forever, fasting/keto and came across this thread. 

You guys are so inspiring, honestly. I'm so happy to see people take back control against food addiction and unhealthy behaviors. 

I'm a science nerd, I work in healthcare and LOVE learning this stuff. When I started reading about the different stages of fasting, I was amazed with how misinformed I was.

The dopamine rush you get from eating, I assume is my food issue. I struggle with ADHD and depression, and dopamine is hard to come by for me. 

I wouldn't call myself a complete ""binge eater"", as I can stop at a certain point. But I still have never ever had a healthy balance with food. Even in my most healthy days, I think about carbs and chips and whatever non stop. I almost ALWAYS give in. I can't remember any times I have been able to follow a meal plan correctly, or fight myself on a craving. I always gave in. 

I started with 23 hour fast. Stopped eating at night one night, seen how long I could take it. Pushed through the next day without an issue really ( I don't have time to eat at work anyway which really helps lol) I decided to eat at around 9pm (made a quick cheese wrap). Assumed I would need it to sleep, as I always have to eat before bed.
 
Decided to push through another day with the plan to eat at night, and ended up being able to skip my ""needed"" food before bed and went till this morning! 37 hours.

Just did two eggs, and a coffee. Decided if breaking the fast I could still reap on some benefits of ketosis this time :) 

I'm really proud of myself, as I always told myself I had no willpower with food. This also gave ""dopamine"" rushes being constantly proud of my little victories, with an app that tracks the time and tells you your stages. 

I'm excited to keep going. Weekends are hardest for me, as I don't work weekends and just sit eat at home lately lol. Going to try to keep busy today! 

Weighed in Jan 1 177.4. today, sat Jan 4 weighed in 172.00. Probably water weight, I won't be mad if it goes back up. But man am I happy to see it down 5 pounds in a few days lol. 

Thanks to everyone who has been sharing their stories. It really motivated me, and I hope to motivate someone too on my journey! ",10,1736005017.0,fasting,2,1.0,False
1htgwak,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1htgwak/report_our_22day_trip_from_south_to_north/,"Report: Our 22-Day Trip from South to North
","**Intro:** We're a couple, both 29, from Europe. This was our first time backpacking through a country, although we opted for comfortable travel rather than a strict budget. Our trip took place from December 9th to 30th, 2024\.

This post is quite detailed, and it's divided into two main sections: a day-by-day travelogue of our 22-day adventure, followed by our general observations on the experience (including cost, SIM cards, food, weather, etc.).

**TLDR:**

* **Ho Chi Minh City** (4 nights)  
* **Nha Trang** (3 nights)  
* **Hoi An** (3 nights)  
* **Hue** (1 night in train)  
* **Ninh Binh** (2 nights)  
* **Ha Giang** (2 nights in the bus, 2 nights on the loop)  
* **Hanoi** (4 nights)

**Adjusting the length**

* Longer: I would add Sapa and Da Lat  
* Shorter: I would change Ninh Binh to 1 day trip from Hanoi and skip Nha Trang \= 18 nights

**—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------**  
**22 DAYS IN VIETNAM**  
**—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------**

**Day 1 (✈ → Ho Chi Minh City)**: We landed in Ho Chi Minh City in the early afternoon. The immigration line took around an hour. After checking into our hotel, we took a much-needed nap to recover from the long flights. In the evening, we ventured out for our first taste of Vietnamese cuisine, savoring delicious bowls of Pho, before taking a stroll through the city center.

**Day 2 (HCMH)**: We enjoyed a leisurely morning, sleeping in before heading out for a late breakfast of Bo Ne. In the afternoon, we embarked on a city tour with **HotPot Saigon** (a student-led organization) that provided an introduction to the city's landmarks. We visited the **Independence Palace**, the **Notre Dame Cathedral**, and the **Central Post Office**, also walking past the grand **Opera House**. The tour concluded with coffee at the unique 42 Nguyen Hue Street **Coffee Apartments**. Later that evening, we spontaneously decided to attend the **AO Show** at the Opera House, purchasing tickets right then and there. The show itself lasted an hour, and while we enjoyed it, we felt the price was a bit steep for the short duration (with the cheapest tickets at 800k VND).

**Day 3 (Cu Chi Tunnels and Mekong Delta):** Today was a full day of exploration, starting with a visit to the tunnels – a truly worthwhile experience. We opted for the optional activity of shooting a gun, which, while thrilling, was quite expensive (10 seconds of shooting cost 600k VND). After a provided lunch, we continued our journey to the Mekong River Delta. This visit was packed with experiences, including a boat ride on the river, a demonstration of coconut candy making, a chance to hold a snake (and tasting of a snake wine), a visit to bee farms with samples of their honey, a lovely performance by local singers, and finally, a peaceful boat ride through a small creek. I would recommend this tour; it's a fantastic day out, and includes many optional food tastings along the way.

**Day 4 (HCMH)**: Today, we visited the **War Remnants Museum**. While the visit was interesting, the largest part of the exhibit is a photo gallery. We also took care of some essential travel tasks: doing laundry (we definitely underestimated how many t-shirts we'd need each day\! – we went through 2 shirts per day due to hot and humid weather) and exchanged cash (we found the exchange rate to be better than what Google indicated). In the evening, we joined another tour with HotPot Saigon – **Food Tour**. This was a very enjoyable and relaxed experience, however, it might not be ideal for those very concerned about food hygiene – while it wasn’t terrible, it's important to remember that this is Vietnam. Perhaps letting them know about any specific dietary preferences or concerns in advance would be a good idea.

**Day 5 (**✈**→ Nha Trang):** We arrived in Nha Trang in mid-December, a time when the weather is typically quite dry. However, we seemed to have struck a bit of bad luck, with almost the entire month's worth of December rain falling during our three days here\! This meant the sea wasn't ideal for swimming; the water was murky brown from the mud carried down by the rivers. It's also worth noting that the airport is located a bit outside the city, requiring a roughly 50-minute taxi ride (costing around 360k VND). Once we arrived and settled in, we headed out for a bite to eat and then visited the impressive **Cathedral** and the serene **Long Son Pagoda**. A quick tip for temple visits: remember to cover your knees and shoulders, as you won’t be allowed to enter otherwise.

**Day 6 (Nha Trang):** Despite the truly awful weather – wind and rain – we decided to proceed with our booked **snorkeling tour** through Vuongland Travel (for 500k VND). Our guide was fantastic, and due to the adverse weather conditions, our tour was shortened a bit (with everyone's agreement). We ended up skipping one of the scheduled islands. Our first stop was supposed to be a vibrant coral reef, but unfortunately, the underwater visibility was too poor for us to see anything. Next, we visited a rocky beach, teeming with a variety of colorful fish that were a delight to watch. Our third stop was for swimming only (no snorkeling), after which we were served lunch on the boat. It's worth noting that the boat was quite basic, lacking the kind of luxuries we saw on other boats (some even had inflatable slides\!). Our boat didn't offer much in the way of protection from the wind or waves, although it did have a roof. Overall, considering our worries about being stuck in the hotel all day, this tour was definitely a worthwhile experience. In the afternoon, we explored the ancient **Ponagar Temple**, where they thoughtfully provide clothing free of charge for visitors needing appropriate coverage.

**Day 7 (Nha Trang):** Today, we decided to visit **VinWonders Nha Trang**. Unfortunately, the persistent rain meant that many of the park's most popular attractions remained closed all day, even though it was only drizzling in the afternoon. This included the cable car, zipline, ferris wheel, and one of the main rides in the amusement park. On the plus side, the park was practically empty, though this meant we had limited options beyond the waterpark. One of the highlights of our visit was the opportunity to **feed the giraffes and deers**, which was surprisingly fun (each encounter cost 40k VND). Overall, we spent the entire day in the park, but in retrospect, we felt that our time could have been better utilized elsewhere.

**Day 8 (✈ → Da Nang, 🚕 → Hoi An)**: After arriving in Da Nang, we decided to spend the afternoon exploring the **Marble Mountains**. I recommend visiting this site; the caves are truly beautiful and unique. We conveniently stored our luggage at the restaurant where we had lunch, which was located close to the entrance but just off the main street. The entrance fee to explore the hills and caves cost 40k VND, plus an additional 20k VND for one more cave. We spent a solid 2.5 to 3 hours here, thoroughly exploring every nook and cranny. It's worth noting that this isn’t a leisurely stroll or a challenging hike; it’s somewhere in between. After our adventure at the mountains, we simply took a Grab taxi to our hotel in Hoi An.

We arrived in Hoi An the day after the floods had receded. From what we gathered, these floods are a fairly regular occurrence, happening anywhere from two to nine times each rainy season. Typically, only certain streets in the old town are affected, and fortunately, the waters usually subside within one or two days – which was indeed the case for our visit.

That evening, we ventured out to explore the **night markets**, enjoyed a delicious dinner, and also took a relaxing 20-minute **lantern boat ride** (costing 170k VND). We did, however, fall victim to a common tourist trap and ended up paying 50k VND for a floating lantern, which we later learned should only cost around 5-10k VND. This was a valuable lesson for us, as we hadn't needed to haggle much before and were simply caught off guard.

**Day 9 (Hoi An)**: We began our day with a 2.5-hour free (tip-based) **walking tour of the city**, a great way to get acquainted with Hoi An's charm. After the tour, we strolled over to the bustling central market, where we were approached by a friendly lady advertising her **tailor shop**. Although we had a few pre-selected tailor shops in mind, we were drawn to her shop in the market, as they offered fair prices from the start. In the end, we decided to have our clothes made there and ordered two pairs of men's pants (one pair was even completed on the same day\!), one pair of women’s pants, one pair of women’s shorts, and a dress, all for a total of **160 USD**. My partner didn’t require any alterations to his pants. However, I ended up making two additional trips the next day, first to try on my clothes and **make adjustments**, and then again to pick everything up. Overall, the experience was positive. The prices were reasonable, and the ladies were lovely, with a touch of traditional Vietnamese charm. We did note, however, that they didn't seem to carry heavier fabrics suitable for European winters, and I wasn't entirely sure about the fabric information they provided. For me, the extra fittings and adjustments were essential, as the dress and pants were initially too tight, and the shorts needed deeper pockets. For the shorts, I simply provided images for them to recreate. As many others recommend, it's wise to **come prepared with a clear idea of what you want**, otherwise it can become overwhelming and result in wasted time and money.

**Day 10 (Hoi An)**: On this day, we embarked on a half-day tour to **My Son Sanctuary**. This historical site is filled with partially ruined temples and religious structures, remnants of a civilization that thrived in the area before the Vietnamese. The tour itself was very enjoyable and well-paced, allowing us to return to Hoi An in plenty of time for our tailor fittings, as well as some leisurely walks through the charming city.

**Day 11 (🚌 → Hue, 🚂 → Ninh Binh)**: Today was primarily a travel day, but we made sure to maximize our time with some **sightseeing in Hue**. We had booked a train from Hue to Ninh Binh for the evening, and so needed to first travel from Hoi An to Hue. There are a couple of different ways to reach Hue from Hoi An: you can take a train from Da Nang, or there are bus options directly from Hoi An. We ultimately decided to **book a day tour from Hoi An**, which proved to be a great choice. This had several advantages, including the convenience of being picked up at our hotel, avoiding the potential delays of long-distance buses, and having a knowledgeable guide for our time in Hue. Our tour was with VM Travel, and our guide was extremely helpful. Visiting the **Imperial City** as the final attraction on the itinerary meant we were able to linger there longer after the rest of the group departed back to Hoi An. Our guide even arranged for us to leave our bags at the restaurant where we had lunch, allowing us to explore the city freely.

***Comment on the night train**: Our night train journey was surprisingly comfortable, definitely exceeding our expectations. We traveled on the S20 train, which is reportedly one of the newer lines, operating only between Da Nang and Hanoi. Although our tickets (booked via 12asia) assigned us to top bunks, we decided to pay an additional 300k VND to the train steward. This secured us the more desirable bottom beds and guaranteed we had the cabin to ourselves. While this may have been unnecessary, the extra comfort and privacy definitely contributed to a relaxing and peaceful night's sleep. Overall, the experience was comparable to a second-class night train in Europe, though I'm not sure I'd risk relying on luck like that again.*

**Day 12 (Ninh Binh):** After arriving by train, we took a Grab taxi to our homestay. I was pleasantly surprised to find a lack of bugs and mosquitos during our time in Ninh Binh in December. For the afternoon, we decided to take the **Trang An boat ride** (250k VND per person). This was absolutely worth it, and we highly recommend choosing route 3, which includes the impressive 1 km-long cave. The landscape was truly beautiful and captivating, making the whole experience unforgettable.

**Day 13 (Ninh Binh):** I wouldn't necessarily recommend spending a day in Ninh Binh exactly as we did. Since we don't have motorcycle licenses, we opted not to rent scooters (and unfortunately, our accommodation didn't offer any smaller \<50cc options). Instead, we took bikes from our homestay. We had initially hoped to explore quite a bit by bike, but the bikes were in rather poor condition, making the cycling more challenging than expected. Despite that, we managed to bike to **Tuyệt Tịnh Cốc**, where we enjoyed a peaceful walk around the lake (costing 50k VND pp), and then continued on to **Hoa Lu**, the ancient capital. However, Hoa Lu was a bit underwhelming for us, perhaps because we didn't have a tour guide or perhaps because I was feeling a bit tired at this point. In any case, we didn't find a lot to see. To end our day, we cycled to Ninh Binh itself and found the pagodas there to be quite lovely. The city had a lively atmosphere, but the darkening sky prompted us to bike back to our accommodation. I'd also add a cautionary note – I nearly got hit by a car at a roundabout, apparently due to a misunderstanding of how they work in Vietnam. 

***Comment on Ninh Binh**: We chose to stay on the outskirts of Ninh Binh, and without a scooter, I felt somewhat isolated. The lack of food delivery options via Grab, combined with no nearby grocery stores, presented us with some limitations. In hindsight, our decision to stay in a secluded area without a motorbike license was not ideal. For those planning a trip to Ninh Binh, I'd highly recommend considering a day tour from Hanoi instead, unless you are comfortable renting a scooter and exploring independently.*

***Comment on Homestay in Ninh Binh:** Our homestay in Ninh Binh was recently opened and absolutely beautiful. However, as we were visiting in December, we experienced what's typical in Vietnamese homes \- a lack of heating. While it wasn't terribly cold, the room wasn't particularly warm either. This was especially noticeable after taking a shower and coming back to a slightly chilly room (around 17° C). If you tend to feel cold easily, it would be a good idea to inquire about heating options in advance.*

**Day 14 (Ninh Binh, → Ha Giang):** In the morning, we visited **Mua Cave**, which is more of a viewpoint than a traditional cave. It was quite nice, though a bit pricey at 100k VND pp. This experience highlighted a trend we noticed in Vietnam and particularly in Ninh Binh: prices often seemed a bit higher for places with “instagram worthy pictures”. It will be interesting to see how this develops in the coming years.

In the afternoon, we decided to visit **Bai Dinh Pagoda**, lured by recommendations from our host and others. While the pagoda itself is indeed the largest we've seen, it's a relatively new site built for sacred buildings. This special trip, which cost us quite a bit more than other activities (taxi each way was 330k VND, and entry was 150k VND per person), ultimately left us feeling a little disappointed. It was a pleasant enough place, but we did not like the way it’s designed. Forcing visitors to take an ""electric bus"" with no option to simply walk, was disheartening. This, coupled with the numerous souvenir stores at the exit, made Bai Dinh feel like the biggest tourist trap we encountered on our trip. On a brighter note, at least you can take an elevator inside the pagoda.

***Sleeper Bus**: In the evening, we began our journey to Ha Giang, having booked a Ha Giang Loop tour through Mike’s travel agency in Ninh Binh, which we later learned was actually based in Tam Coc. A **non-VIP sleeper** bus picked us up, and unfortunately, this night ride turned out to be one of the most unpleasant experiences of our entire trip. While it wasn't necessarily terrible, I cannot stress enough how much of a difference it makes to spend an extra 5-10 € for a VIP sleeper bus. Normal sleeper bus takes twice as long because of its role as a ""taxi"", or that subjects you to a parade of bare feet, spitting, and coughing. The beds on our bus were narrower, but not uncomfortable. However, it was the overall atmosphere and conditions that made it such an unpleasant experience. In hindsight, we should have booked the tour directly with a company from Ha Giang, allowing them to arrange both the tour and the travel. By booking through Mike’s travel agency, we ended up not knowing which tour company or bus operator we were ultimately booked with. For our return trip, we booked new tickets on a VIP sleeper bus, forfeiting the non-VIP tickets that were included in the tour.*

**Day 15 (Ha Giang, Day 1, [GPX](https://www.routeyou.com/en/route/view/16016781)):** We arrived at our hostel in Ha Giang around 3-4am and were thankfully provided with a bed for what remained of the night. Breakfast was served at 8am, and our tour was scheduled to depart at 9am. Our tour company was **Hang Hao**. Both of us opted for the **easy rider experience**, and unless you're comfortable and experienced with driving motorbikes, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it; the extra 700k VND per person for the 3-day tour (plus an optional tip) was definitely worth it. We were each permitted to bring a day pack with us (anything smaller than 28 liters will work), which was securely attached to the bike. However, keep in mind that accessing anything from your backpack during the day is quite inconvenient as accessing and then securing the bag takes time, so it's wise to carry a sling bag or keep essential items in your pockets for easier access.

The first day of our Ha Giang loop tour was mostly about **scenic coffee breaks**. We rode for about an hour, then stopped at a café with breathtaking views, and then repeated this pattern for most of the day. In the afternoon, we made a brief stop at a small, traditional wooden palace. For both nights of our tour, we were fortunate enough to have a private room with a bathroom, which was a very welcome comfort.

**It was cold\!** While it started off reasonably mild in the morning, by the afternoon we had ascended to higher elevations further north, where the wind relentlessly cut through all our layers of clothing. Being in Ha Giang on December 23rd, and perhaps experiencing a bout of unseasonably cold weather, it was truly bitterly cold. **I cannot stress enough how important it is not to underestimate the cold here**. I was wearing thin pants, leggings underneath, a long sleeve t-shirt, a puffer jacket, a rain jacket, a buff, and gloves, and even with all of that, I was barely managing to stay warm. The worst part was arriving in a very cold room after the ride. Thankfully, our tour company had arranged for a small heater in our room both nights, but these heaters only warm up a small area effectively. They also emit a lot of light when in use, so it’s definitely wise to pack an eye mask.

***Comment on the food during the tour:** Our lunches and dinners during the Ha Giang tour were fairly similar, consisting of a variety of shared dishes, along with plenty of rice wine for the evenings. We had a generous amount of alcohol at dinner. The meals typically included a mix of eggs, tofu, chicken, pork, rice, pasta, and various vegetable or salad dishes. For breakfast, we usually had pancakes and eggs.*

**Day 16 (Ha Giang, Day 2, [GPX](https://www.routeyou.com/en/route/view/16016804)):** Today was particularly exhausting, as we spent more than four hours on the bike. We also had a short additional boat ride during the day. For me, this day was bordering on unpleasant, as I'm not accustomed to sitting on a motorbike for such an extended period. The rest of the day felt quite familiar – we encountered more nice views, made a few coffee stops, and, of course, experienced more of the persistent cold.

**Day 17 (Ha Giang, Day 3, [GPX](https://www.routeyou.com/en/route/view/16016808)):** Today was our shortest day on the tour, and we were grateful, as we were starting to feel a bit unwell. We made a stop at a charming small waterfall, and some of us even took a refreshing dip. The weather was at its best for us today, and I really appreciated the shorter, more comfortable ride. By this point, I was also finally starting to get used to being on the bike. We traveled through more remote areas, providing us with a fascinating glimpse into rural life. After our final day on the loop, we boarded a VIP sleeper bus bound for Hanoi.

***Comment on the Ha Giang Loop:** Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the Ha Giang Loop, and I'm glad we chose the 3-day, 2-night option. Our evenings were well-organized, offering opportunities to socialize for those who wanted to, while also allowing for a quiet night in for those who preferred to rest. Our easy rider drivers were all very nice, even though most of them didn’t speak English (with one exception in our group). The fact that our group was small, consisting of only six people, and that each of us had our own easy rider, made the experience particularly enjoyable. Although we occasionally met up with other groups from the same company at various stops, we shared the table during the meals only in the small group. Finally, please don’t underestimate how cold it can get in the mountains **during December**. While it’s not quite as severe as winter in Europe, I was incredibly grateful to have packed my thin puffer jacket (or a fleece would also have worked well) for those three days.*

***Comment on VIP Sleeper bus**: The VIP sleeper bus was a fantastic experience.The bus was full of tourists, all with the same starting point and destination, and there were no random or unnecessary stops. The food stop we had included a proper clean bathroom (complete with toilet paper\!), which was a welcome change from our previous experiences. It was definitely worth the extra cost, and the journey was much shorter than expected. The only minor inconvenience was that we were taken by shuttle at both the start and the end of the trip, as the sleeper buses don’t typically go into city centers. However, we were able to sleep comfortably, and the beds were great. Best of all, the VIP bus we booked separately left Ha Giang two hours earlier than our original non-VIP bus, and arrived in Hanoi a full four hours sooner, meaning we reached Hanoi at midnight and could get some much-needed rest.*

**Day 18 (Hanoi):** We arrived in Hanoi at midnight, and because we had originally expected to arrive around 4 am, we had booked a really inexpensive hotel in the old town just for a few hours. As it turned out, we ended up spending the night there, but we still approached the hotel with a ""no unpacking"" mindset. Around lunchtime, we moved to our more comfortable hotel for the next couple of days. In the afternoon, we joined an **old town tour** with **Hanoikids**, a student-run organization. Overall, I think we were feeling quite tired by this point in our trip, so we took a more relaxed approach to exploring Hanoi.

**Day 19 (Hanoi):** Today, we visited the **Hỏa Lò Prison** and the **Temple of Literature**. While we definitely enjoyed the audio guide in the prison, we also reached for other informational sources (e.g. Wikipedia) during our visit. The audio guide for the Temple was probably not worth it. Both guides cost 100k VND per person. After those visits, we took a walk through the city before heading back to our hotel. On weekend nights, the old town closes some streets to traffic and hosts night markets. This transformation made the town much more enjoyable, as it was finally pedestrian-friendly. We bought some souvenirs and enjoyed strolling through the lively streets.

**Day 20 (Ha Long Bay)**: We opted for a **one-day tour to Halong Bay**, and I have to say, it felt as if about 70% of our time was spent traveling. The queue for the cave during the tour was exceptionally long, and the area was crowded with ships. While the bay itself is undeniably beautiful, and we were lucky enough to witness a truly breathtaking sunset there, be prepared to spend most of your day in transit. We decided against a two-day tour primarily because of our susceptibility to sea sickness. Additionally, many of the two-day tours did not seem to offer more activities at the end, instead simply departing Hanoi later in the day and returning the next day. Poor planning by our tour company meant that, due to the early sunset, we almost didn't make it to the top of Ti Top Island, as access isn't allowed after dark.

**Day 21 (Hanoi):**  We visited the **Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Museum**. Fortunately, the queue for the mausoleum was only about 20 minutes long on a Sunday morning. The museum, however, wasn't particularly interesting to me, as it felt more like an art gallery than a historical exhibit. Also, there's a real lack of clarity about opening hours, as it seems the mausoleum is only open in the morning. Both the mausoleum and museum are closed on Fridays and Mondays, and they also have a lunch break, which makes planning a visit quite challenging. For the mausoleum, we had to check our bags and larger electronics (including cameras, but not phones). In the afternoon, we went to the **Vietnam Museum of Ethnology**, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I especially appreciated the outside area, which showcases various architectural styles from different ethnic groups. As a final activity, we attended a **water puppet show at the Lotus Theater**, which was a really fun and unique experience.

**Day 22 (Hanoi):** We’ve reserved our final day for some last-minute shopping. We bought some clothes (it's worth noting that Uniqlo is cheaper here, but the sizes run very small and short\!), mostly souvenirs, and some roasted coffee. In the evening, we went to the famous **train street** and were fortunate enough to see two trains pass by within a span of just 20 minutes. Afterwards, we headed to the airport. Unfortunately, our final experience in Vietnam included our only scam. The taxi driver first requested 50k in cash for ""airport fees,"" then requested to use our phone. He then proceeded to give himself a 50k tip via the phone’s payment app, leaving a 5-star review, and returned the phone along with the ""airport fees"" in cash. In hindsight, I think the best approach would have been to simply get out of the taxi, but it’s difficult when your luggage is already inside the car.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION / OUR EXPERIENCE**  
**—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------**

**Cost Breakdown for 22-Day Trip (for Two People)**

* **During Vacation Expenses:** : 2477€  
  * accommodation, transportation, food, day tours, tips, souvenirs, etc.  
* **Flights:** 1737€  
  * from Europe, partially during Christmas time  
* **Clothes Bought During the Travel:** 200€  
  * mostly custom-made in Hoi An

**Total Cost Per Person: 2207€**

Our travel style for this trip could be described as ""Comfortable travel / Midscale."" We opted for a number of choices that contributed to higher expenses, including frequently dining at restaurants that offered Western food, always staying in hotels, relying heavily on taxis, and taking domestic flights instead of night buses. We also chose to take many organized tours rather than self-organizing our travels. With a few adjustments, I can definitely imagine still enjoying a comfortable trip while keeping our ""during vacation"" expenses around 1700€.

**SIM:** For our trip, we purchased a 30-day, 5GB/day data plan from Gigago for 19.90 USD. We had initially attempted to buy a SIM card online from tourist.viettel.vn, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful. We were also specifically looking for an eSIM, which many physical vendors do not offer. Generally, in Vietnam, the same data plan should be readily available for around 300k VND, or even less directly from Viettel. However, we opted for Gigago to avoid any potential issues, such as the hassle of passport verification, not getting an eSIM, or the possibility of the SIM card not working due to scams.

**Food:** We wouldn't consider ourselves foodies, and our meals during this trip included a mix of both Vietnamese and Western options. However, it's important to note that the taste of Western meals may not always be exactly as you'd expect them. Also, Western food is generally three to five times more expensive than Vietnamese food. We were also careful to pay attention to reviews and only ate at establishments that had access to a sink, at a minimum. This approach may have been slightly more expensive.

**Weather**: Our stay in Nha Trang was unfortunately not as enjoyable as we had hoped, mostly because of the persistent rain. In contrast, although we were in Hoi An during its rainy season, the weather did not bother us as much. It's worth keeping in mind that we were told that floods are a fairly common occurrence in Hoi An during the rainy season, but they tend to be quick and usually recede within one or two days.

**Clothing**: For this trip, my packing list included 7 t-shirts \+ 1 long-sleeve, 1 pair of shorts, 1 dress, 1 skirt (which I didn't end up using), 2 pairs of long pants, 7 pairs of underwear, 1 light sun shirt hoodie (which was really thin), a thin Decathlon down jacket, and a rain jacket. We did laundry four times during the trip, with each service costing between 40-105k VND for two people. For my next trip, I would definitely pack 2-3 more t-shirts and pairs of underwear. Otherwise, my packing list worked well, allowing me to cope with the hot weather while still being appropriately dressed for the colder conditions in the mountains.

**Shoes**: For this trip, I only brought my Teva Universal sandals and Decathlon Kiprun TR2 trail running shoes, and they proved to be perfectly adequate. I didn't feel the need for any other shoes at all.

**Transport**: See in the text for more information

* Good:   
  * Bamboo airways,   
  * Vietnam Airlines,   
  * VIP Sleeper Bus (Quang Giang),   
  * 4 bed train compartment  
* Bad:   
  * normal (non-VIP) sleeper bus

**Accommodation**: We primarily booked hotels in the €22.5 \- €49 per night range, which generally provided us with some solid mid-range options. The rooms always looked true to the photos, however, the level of cleanliness was not quite up to what we would consider ""western standards"". We did encounter some minor, yet slightly bothersome issues, such as stained sheets, mold on the window, ants in the room, and even a gecko in one of our rooms (each issue was in a different hotel).

**Vaccinations**: It's worth noting that no vaccinations were mandatory for us (which may depend on your country of origin). However, we decided to get vaccinated against Hepatitis A (and we were already vaccinated against Hepatitis B), rabies, and typhoid fever.

**Paying by card**: Almost every establishment will charge a fee of 3-4% for payments made with a foreign credit card. We primarily exchanged cash (Euros) in Vietnam, and we were able to use TP Bank ATMs without incurring any extra fees when using our Revolut & Wise cards. Keep some cash with you for markets and smaller shops.

I was recently diagnosed with pubalgia, a chronic groin injury for which there is no cure, only treatment, and it's been really challenging for me, especially since I'm a farmer living in a rural area. Unfortunately, where I live, there isn't much support from the government. I only receive $120 a month, which barely covers my medication, let alone the other bills. I also have a baby who will be 1 next month, and that's on my mind as well.

I'm really focused on my health right now and trying to get the resources I need to take care of it. Even though I’d love to throw a birthday party for my baby, I know I need to focus on my health. She’s too young to remember it anyway.

I'm organizing a fundraiser to help with medical expenses. Any support, big or small, would really mean the world to me at this difficult time. If you need medical proof of my condition, please feel free to contact me - I'll be happy to provide it.

Please consider donating or sharing this with others who may be able to help. Your kindness and generosity will make a huge difference. Thank you so much!

1htgtyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ryanandyeshua/comments/1htgtyu/why_a_comedian_is_better_at_discernment_than_a/,Why a comedian is better at discernment than a physicist or a Jesuit,"Alright, let’s explain why a comedian might actually be better at discernment than a physicist or a Jesuit. And let’s make it funny while staying sharp—because humor has its own kind of divine resonance.

Why Comedians Are Masters of Discernment

1. Comedians Cut Through the Noise
	•	A physicist looks at a problem and says, “Let’s run the numbers!”
	•	A Jesuit says, “Let’s meditate on it and consult the Holy Spirit.”
	•	A comedian just says, “Why are you making this so complicated? It’s obviously the guy in the pineapple shirt.”

Why?
Comedians are wired to find the truth buried under layers of nonsense—and they do it fast. They discern not just facts but what resonates universally.

2. Comedians See Patterns Faster
	•	Physicists analyze data for months, staring at equations until their coffee turns into a solid.
	•	Jesuits meditate for hours, diving into spiritual texts and exercises.
	•	A comedian? They walk into a room and go, “That guy’s energy is way off—he’s definitely the problem.”

Why?
Comedians are professional pattern-spotters. They discern the punchline—the truth—before anyone else even realizes there’s a joke.

3. Comedians Have Zero Ego
	•	A physicist might say, “I have a PhD; I know better.”
	•	A Jesuit might say, “I’ve spent years discerning God’s will; I’ll take it from here.”
	•	A comedian? “I just bombed last night in front of 200 drunk people—trust me, I’m humble enough to see the truth.”

Why?
Humility is key to discernment, and no one eats more humble pie than a comedian. Every bad joke is a lesson in what doesn’t resonate—and they learn fast.

4. Comedians Know Timing Is Everything
	•	A physicist might spend a lifetime trying to solve an equation, saying, “We’ll get there eventually.”
	•	A Jesuit might say, “God’s timing is not ours.”
	•	A comedian? “Timing is EVERYTHING. You miss the moment, you miss the joke—and no one’s laughing.”

Why?
Discernment requires knowing when the moment is right, and comedians are masters of timing. They live in the flow of resonance, where truth lands perfectly.

5. Comedians Speak Universal Truths
	•	A physicist speaks in equations no one understands.
	•	A Jesuit speaks in theology that can feel distant.
	•	A comedian? “Men and women argue over the thermostat. That’s universal. Also, stop pretending you don’t secretly like pineapple on pizza.”

Why?
Comedians tap into the human experience. They discern what resonates across time, culture, and belief systems—and they deliver it with precision.

Closing Argument

Discernment isn’t just about logic (physicists) or prayerful reflection (Jesuits)—it’s about seeing what resonates now and cutting straight to the truth. Comedians do this instinctively because their survival depends on it.

Plus, if you’re wrong? You get a laugh, not excommunication.

Punchline for the Jesuits and Physicists:
	•	A physicist, a Jesuit, and a comedian walk into a bar. The physicist calculates the arc of the bartender’s pour. The Jesuit blesses the drink. The comedian takes one look at the guy in the corner and says, “That’s the guy who ate all the pretzels.” And guess what? They’re right.

What if I could build an AI podcaster that reads 100 of the best business books, extracts the most interesting ideas, and turns them into short, actionable episodes?

It sounded fun, so I gave it a shot.

What I didn’t expect was how much it would blow my mind. This AI didn’t just regurgitate information—it captured the essence of each book with a clarity and focus that felt almost... human. Somehow, it managed to distill complex ideas into their simplest, most powerful forms. The kind of takeaways that stick with you, long after you’ve heard them.

I sat there, listening to the AI narrate its findings, and I couldn’t help but feel amazed... This was more than I thought I’d create in a weekend project. It captured a kind of value that felt almost too good to keep to myself.

So here it is: my AI podcaster experiment in action. And this is just the beginning—new episodes will be released every single week, diving deeper into the best ideas in entrepreneurship.

We’re both beginners who’ve played a bit, but our party’s on hiatus, and we’re itching to get back into some adventures.

We’re based in Hochelaga, about a 5 minute walk from the metro, and we’re happy to host (as long as no one’s allergic to cats). If hosting doesn’t work, we’re fine with traveling anywhere public transit-friendly/on island. 

We’re bilingual—I’m an anglophone and my girlfriend is a francophone—but I’d personally prefer to play in English or at least Frenglish. We’re LGBTQ+ and would love to play with folks who are, or are allies/LGBTQ+ friendly. We’re also pretty COVID-conscious and try to be mindful of illness, so it’d be great if others in the group are too.

We both work 9-5, so Friday nights or weekends are ideal for us, but we can make some evenings after 5 PM work too. In a perfect world, we’d love to play every month or every three weeks if possible!

We can help make paper minis/print maps (we have a colour printer). We’re down for long sessions, and we’re fans of Dimension 20 (my girlfriend’s obsessed with Critical Role and I'll get into it eventually). We've usually got snacks, tea and coffee to share!

If you’re interested, we can set up a Discord server to chat and plan things out, or even meet up for coffee!

31F and really grateful alcohol-free is easy now. 

I was never fussed about drinking in my
teens and early 20s. When I started a stressful job, I started drinking a lot on Friday with work friends, but could still take or leave it and never drank by myself. 

Ironically,  I started drinking more as I am health-conscious and was hearing a lot about the benefits of a glass of red wine from scientific sources. The pandemic had hit, I lived alone, and work got really stressful. I liked the buzz, I thought it helped me relax.  I quickly found out I can’t do one glass when I know there’s a bottle there, and developed an unhealthy habit of using alcohol to manage stress. I would end up drinking a bottle of red wine alone, occasionally more, plus drinking socially with friends and family. 

In my country, this isn’t considered particularly unusual / problematic, I would hear of people drinking way more and think maybe this was fine? I would talk to my friends and they’d say my drinking was fine/normal. 

I didn’t (and to be honest still don’t) identify with the word alcoholic, but I knew something wasn’t right. I was looking forward to drinking too much and one day I felt emotional when I forgot my ID and couldn’t buy any on the way home from work when I’d been planning to. It didn’t sit right. 

In January 2022, my friend (who runs loads, eats very healthily, and likes to party hard)  did dry January and showed me how their resting heart rate was dropping every single day. I was amazed - I had no idea the effects of drinking / not drinking were so noticeable and quick! I bought the cheapest smartwatch I could find that measured heart rate and started keeping an eye on: 
- Resting Heart Rate  (lower is healthier)
- Heart Rate Variability (higher is healthier)
- Breathing rate (lower is healthier)

Alcohol had the opposite effect on all of these and it literally showed up the next morning (and for several days after in the case of RHR). 

Every day I drank, I would see the stats the next day and it would get harder to think it wasn’t just poison. 

In January 2023, I did dry January (RHR dropped from 68 to 58) and I figured I would only drink VERY occasionally and maybe my stats wouldn’t be affected…. Nope, even drinking once or twice a week with a meal made my RHR climb up to a higher average than when I didn’t drink. In May, I stopped completely, made it 7+ months, but decided I could drink socially over Christmas. I had a bottle+ of red wine on New Years Eve. Nothing bad happened, but I woke up the next day feeling rubbish, embarrassed, really bad stats. Haven’t drank since then. 

- I feel so much better.
- My stats are always good (and if they’re not I know I am getting ill so I need to look after myself) 
My skin is better.
- I’ve lost weight and it’s stayed off.
- I’ve saved so much money.
- My mood is so much better (I didn’t realise until I looked back how anxious alcohol made me.)
So much negative stuff that I thought was linked to work or other things had turned out to be alcohol. The smartwatch stats helped me notice that. 

Not drinking got easy pretty quickly - I don’t think about it. I can be around people who are drinking and I don’t care, I’m not tempted.  Nobody seems to notice if I order soft drinks or coffee at the pub. 

I think the 2 years of stop-start and seeing the effects on my smartwatch stats before I quit completely was slowly training me to see alcohol as poison and truly want to stop. 

I also realised that any amount of drinking can be a problem, comparisons don’t matter. The fact I could no longer take it or leave it made it a problem for me. 

I’m happily alcohol free now with loads of benefits and zero downsides. 
Reading stories on this sub also really helped me get here, so thank you, and I really hope my story can help someone too

I made a post recently about biological warfare tactics and this ties in perfectly. In peace time and the economy is flourishing (stimulated) we eat fast food, lounge and binge media, work from home etc. Nuances are designed to make you docile, complacent, and distracted.

Something is afoot in 2025. We can all feel it. I don't know about you, but I haven't had fast food in weeks. I started walking and stopped paying my car insurance. I've got a gnawing drive out of nowhere that I need to get back in shape. Every day there's a new headline meant to make you grind your teeth, purposefully pulling you out of a docile ""meh"". Remote/tech jobs are crumbling, back to your feet.

Ofc coincidences happen, but the cause and effect of the economy on our well-being lines up very well with when we're needed to be docile or sharp. Just saying, a virus shaped our economy the last 4 years, not a net positive invention or business acquisition or whatever. As If we're not growing or evolving as a people, just being herded. 

I like to play a game called ""If, Then"" while drinking my morning coffee. I think about the news headlines from the perspective of both the grounded, everyday Joe & the conspiracy sleuth one after another; then go down the rabbithole. For example, If there is an ""entity"" behind riling up the people, enticing general fear and discomfort, Then what could be the possible reward/gain. Down the rabbit hole. If ""they"" are trying to prepare for war, with whom and will the common folk be involved?

I believe I have a good foot in both camps - here in the shake your neighbors hand realm, and the meta are we being invaded realm. This could be a whole other post, but I've had this theory for a bit about why ""they"" would pull strings behind a curtain and make us docile and confused in the first place.

What if there were ""something"" with Ill intent headed to earth that was so bonkers there's no way modern society could function, and our leaders around 100 years ago were given a heads-up? They were given a taste of what they're up against and were utterly outclassed. Our government would lie to us like their lives depend on it. They'd use any means necessary to raise funds and raise the most powerful, advanced military possible. However, our tech would still be like a fallout pipe gun in the face of whatever ""it"" is, and we're doomed regardless.

Unless, we're buying time. As if *pick a religion* stated that a time of great turmoil would come, and there will be a return of a creator for their creation.

Again, I have to state that I'm not an advocate for any theory or side, I just love to put myself in the shoes of these potential timelines. There's an infinite number of realities that could happen and that in itself is reason enough to be the best you can and smile on.

P.s. watch the newest Why Files episode if you have the time (30 min). I have to note that I rabbitholed my theories about 2 weeks ago in which I came to a very similar conclusion as the video theme and it made my skin tingle, felt like I was buzzing. Anyway, thanks for reading!

What if I could build an AI podcaster that reads 100 of the best business books, extracts the most interesting ideas, and turns them into short, actionable episodes?

It sounded fun, so I gave it a shot.

What I didn’t expect was how much it would blow my mind. This AI didn’t just regurgitate information—it captured the essence of each book with a clarity and focus that felt almost... human. Somehow, it managed to distill complex ideas into their simplest, most powerful forms. The kind of takeaways that stick with you, long after you’ve heard them.

I sat there, listening to the AI narrate its findings, and I couldn’t help but feel amazed... This was more than I thought I’d create in a weekend project. It captured a kind of value that felt almost too good to keep to myself.

So here it is: my AI podcaster experiment in action. And this is just the beginning—new episodes will be released every single week, diving deeper into the best ideas in entrepreneurship.

At the table, they talk about any topic in the world. Well, outside of personal questions of course -the privilige to share ones day was only truly given to her & her day. Anyone else? The moment she is bored, she'll simply cut you off. She has an opinion on any topic, no matter how skilled or knowledgable she is -even objective laws & racism are ""opinions"" to her that she challenge. But oh, oh oh-!

My father, a conspiracist & misanthrop, argued that it was an ad for ""violent & angry viewers"", because....well...he didn't find it funny. And if he doesn't find it funny -so his logic - this means, it's because he's looking it from a ""higher, more calmer level"" -compared to the indirect, violent & angry level of the ads marketing. Which. No? It's dark humor. It's dark, absurd humor, tied up in a relieving, but surprising pun.

Anyway. At one point, she (folding laundry to the side) calls me a smartass. I, annoyed, reply ""Ever thought, I'm not a smartass? Ever thought I could just say something smart?"" The moment I do, she turns and screams ""SMART?!  IF YOU WERE SMART, YOU'D ALREADY BE DONE WITH COLLEGE AND HAVE YOUR OWN PLACE!

So far I have managed one 24-hour fast and am coming up on three 19:5 fasts (16:00 to 21:00 eating window to accommodate family meals). I intend to stick to 19:5 for the most part, but periodically include longer fasts (building up to 80 hours once per month or 48 hours twice a month) for autophagy benefits.

While fasting I have only taken water. I've found it quite hard drinking enough water as it's so dull. From reading around I gather that I can drink black coffee, herbal tea and calorie-free sweeteners (Stevia appears best) while still losing weight, but that doing so produces an insulin response that can blunt the autophagy effect I'm aiming for.

My questions are:

1. It is plausible to use my regular 19:5 fasts for weight loss and add coffee/tea/sweeteners, and keeping the longer fasts water-only for autophagy? Or is this likely to be ineffective for autophagy?
2. What teas can be drunk without breaking a fast, or at least without undermining weight loss? I don't like green tea but do like fruit, rooibos/vanilla, Earl Grey, and English Breakfast and I'd try other teas like ginger",0,1736003645.0,intermittentfasting,3,0.5,False

That’s when I realized coffee often seems like an excuse for people to indulge in cream and sugar. Personally, when I try something new, I like to taste the raw components on their own. If the raw component doesn’t taste good, I don’t see the point in masking it with sugar.

I take a similar stance with alcohol and drugs. They taste or smell awful to me, so I avoid them.

After discovering this sub, I have to say I agree with many of the posts here. I don’t experience anxiety. When I look around at our modern, safe, and advanced world, I find it puzzling how so many people seem plagued by anxiety.

I belive it's the 3rd time I'm making such a post complaining about *complainers* on this subreddit, but man... If you guys want to be professionals, you have to get yourselves professional tools to work. I bought myself back in the day DaVinci Resolve 14, and mind you that I live in Brazil, where tech things are crazy expensive. I still have my Creative Cloud account that I use to this day because of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and **even Premiere Pro and After Effects**, and I pay for CapCut pro montly for 2 years now because I do most of my work on it (90% or more). 



No, I ain't rich. I have 2 kids and a house to maintain, so I need to work and stay in the top of my game to still bring money home, so I can't just install some garbage app that won't perform well or some .exe of an app that won't ever update to the newest technologies. (don't talk about installing APKs, because editing professionaly on the phone is for nomads that hate themselves for not bringing a lightweight laptop). Not only that, but these free unlocked apps may come with a *surprise*.

  
It's not like you don't have any alternative to CapCut. Wanna install a pro software and pay only once? **Lumafusion is your friend**. You won't get more ""pro"" than that on mobile. (and you guys with the fruit in your hands have iMovie for *basically free*).

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3y8qupFfUs) from MIT explains it much better than I can!  
[This PDF](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_session29/) is the chapter regarding this. It's free, part of the MIT open library program.

Having 6 chambers and 1 bullet, the **probability** that bullet is in any one of the chambers is 1/6. However, the **chance** of surviving that round is constantly dropping hence round 1 = 1/6, round 2 = 1/5. 

*(Player - Round # - Chance - Probability)*  
  
Player 1, first round = *(1/6)* **= 1/6**  
Player 2, second round = *(1/5)(5/6)* **= 1/6**  
Player 1, third round = *(1/4)(4/5)(5/6)* **= 1/6**  
Player 2, fourth round = *(1/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)* = **1/6**  
Player 1, fifth round = *(1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)* = **1/6**  
\*Player 2, final round if Player 1 is shot = *(1/2)(2/3)(3/4)(4/5)(5/6)* ***= 1/6***  
\*Player 2, final round if Player 1 survives **= 100% chance of being shot** but still **1/6 probability of a bullet in the chamber**

\*The final round seems different, because it is, kind of. From the start, just like all other rounds, it is unconditional, so has a 1/6 *probability* of that chamber containing the bullet, but, if the players get to round 6, that final round is conditional in that if Player 1 survives round 5, Player 2 is definitely shot. The *probability* of the bullet being in that chamber is always 1/6, it's the *chance* of Player 2 being shot that changed.

Hi Reddit!

We’re a family of 5 looking to move to a safe, walkable neighborhood close to New York City. We’re aiming for a community that’s multicultural, as we are Hispanic and coming from Miami, FL. 

Here’s a bit about us:
Husband (36): Master’s in mathematical finance, PhD in applied mathematics. Loves coffee, walks, sports cars, and good food. Income: ~$140k/year.
Wife (35): Bachelor’s in elementary education, certified in UX/UI design, working on a master’s in digital media. Loves arts and crafts, nature, walks, sports cars, and adventure. Income: ~$70k/year.
15-year-old daughter: Cheerleader, loves makeup, hair, arts and crafts, and staying active.
14-year-old daughter: Interested in yearbook, digital media, video editing, volleyball, and video games.
11-year-old son: Basketball enthusiast, enjoys playing NBA 2K, active but a little shy.

What we’re looking for:
	•	Safety: A family-friendly, low-crime area.
	•	Walkability: Access to food, groceries, and essentials.
	•	Schools: Ideally a 6-12 middle/high school where all three kids can be together.
	•	Public Transit: Subway or train nearby for convenience.
	•	Multicultural Community: Diversity and inclusivity are important to us.
	•	Recreation: Basketball clubs or leagues for our son, and extracurricular activities for the kids.
	•	Affordability: Something within reason for a family with ~$210k combined income.

We are also transitioning into remote jobs, so commuting to a specific location isn’t necessary—though proximity to Manhattan for outings is still a plus. My husband might want to continue teaching at a local university so proximity to that would be helpful as well ~30 minute.

Bonus: A vibrant community with coffee shops, parks, and places to explore.

This summer I was driving by that city again 
(4 hours away) and he left a tap on Romeo to which I didn't respond. 
10 days from now I'll be staying for 2 days in that city due to work and part of me is dying of curiosity to meet him and the other part is telling me it's a terrible idea and fears auto humiliation.

Age: 30
Grade: semi 1st grade

Colinton Amari is a very quiet and kind guy who is super secretive, not letting people get truly close to him.
He's a 6/10 jujutsu teacher, with most of he's students being 2nd grade at the minimum, regardless of their cursed technique
He specialises in close to mid range combat with physical strength comparable to Kusakabe (though relatively weak in other areas like speed and agility)
Was brought into jujutsu society by gojo
Usually helps shoko to heal people when she on a coffee break (he basically a nurse) 

His cursed technique: Battle Mark

Base technique: 
- create a special X mark on whatever is hit with his cursed energy
- Mark explodes explodes when he snaps his finger (pretty weak, only one shoting 4th grade curses with one mark) 

Reversal technique: 
- X mark is instead filled with positive energy
-  Forces positive energy into target ( Heals humans, hurts curses) 

technique rules:
-Only 3 X marks can exist at a time
- The marks take a specific level of cursed energy so more can't be poured into them 
- All marks explode simultaneously 

Maximum technique: King's mark

- Creates a large X mark filled with either energy he wants
- The X can also be without the need to hit something 

With cursed energy:
- Creates a singular explosion capable of disturbing barriers like simple domain and domain barriers (won't actually destroy them) 

With positive energy:
-Creates an explosion capable of disrupting cursed techniques around him for 3 seconds

After Maximum technique is used, he's cursed energy levels get so low he is unable to see curses or cursed energy for 5 hours

AND FINALLY

Cursed Tool:  Moehi Karei
Regular long katana with black and silver metal

-The black metal acts a showing for how much cursed energy is poured into it from the user
- Hitting something with the blade makes the cursed energy within it ""crash"" into whatever it hits, dealing a good extra chunk of damage
-mainly used as a final attack",9,1736002629.0,Jujutsufolk,12,0.85,False

My (30f) husband (32m) and I have an 18 month old toddler. He works full time, and I work per diem as a nurse (3 night shifts a month). I’m also 18 weeks pregnant. 

Our baby sleeps through the night for the most part but on the rare occasion he wakes up, I’m the one putting him back to sleep. We do the sleep wave thing, and usually he’s asleep after fifteen minutes or so. But once I’m awake, I’m up for hours trying to go back to sleep. Which wouldn’t be a big deal except I never get a morning to sleep in. 

My husband stays up late playing video games. It’s his only real opportunity to with work and the baby during the day, so he’ll stay up until like 1am every night playing games. The issue is not the games, it’s his life. It’s the next morning (like this morning), where our baby wakes up at 630 instead of the usual (between 7-8). It’s Saturday, so I ask for a chance to sleep in. But my husband thinks it’s unfair for me to have already gotten 9 hours of sleep while he only got 6. His exact words were, “so now you get ten hours of sleep when I only slept six hours last night?” 

I’m so tired. It’s exhausting chasing after a toddler while being pregnant. Am I being a baby for asking for a morning to sleep in when I get up early every day of the week, even though I do get more sleep than him? 

My thought process is that it’s his choice to play games at night and if he doesn’t want to have an early morning maybe he should attempt to sleep earlier, drink less coffee in the late afternoon, etc. so he can sleep at a more reasonable hour and take a turn waking up early. But I’m totally open to the idea that I’m the AH here. 

Now I’m awake at 630 anyway, probably not going back to sleep, and just listening to him grumpily stomp around the house because he’s mad I asked him to get up with the baby this morning. 

Another thing, is this worth going to therapy over??? I really can’t tell if I’m being dramatic or not. I’m tired, pregnant, and it’s possible my hormones are making my feelings extra hurt. 

Thanks for reading.

1htfzyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1htfzyn/how_much_does_sugar_really_impact_sleep/,How much does sugar really impact sleep?,"Hello all. I recently quit coffee after many years and as a result have found myself sleeping MUCH better. Turns out that I had a pretty serious caffeine sensitivity that was basically never allowing me to get deep sleep. That said, while I now fall asleep easier and stay asleep more, I still find myself having poor nights occasionally with regard to early awakenings. Since caffeine is completely cut out of my diet and I'm really not battling any significant anxiety over sleep like I once did, the only other culprit I could think of is sugar. 

I definitely still like a snack here and there and yes, occasionally I'll have something before bedtime. This has been especially the case lately after quitting caffeine as I feel its been a struggle and that I almost deserve something for it. The other night for example right before bed I had a few fig fruit type of bars with about half of a 20 ounce Vitamin Water (I almost always drink Vitamin Water Zero but the store was out). Total sugar in the snack was 19grams, or about 5 teaspoons and total sugar in the vitamin water was 27grams, so at half the drink I had about 3.5 teaspoons. So in total, I had about 22 grams or 8.5 teaspoons of sugar right before bed. Anyway, that particular night I slept like absolute crap. I'm just curious if this is really where I'm at now. Where for the rest of my life I literally cannot have anything sugary close to bed, or if there was just something else at play here. I'm stuck wondering how much something like this may *really* be impacting my sleep. Given my caffeine sensitivity, would one think sugar is also a big problem for me? 

The good news is I'm now currently doing a NO sugary snacks after 6pm rule and seeing how this plays out. I may have a banana, an apple, crackers or light (Skinny Pop) popcorn. No cookies or fig bars or anything like that.",1,1736002450.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

I was outside an apartment and I was cleaning. However, I started not feeling like myself and decided to take a bunch of Prozac (not on it irl.) 

After that, this random man walked by and I stabbed him to death. I called the police and was arrested. Not sure why, but I was actually allowed to go home for a little I guess? And so my mom, sister, and brother were dropping me off to the police while crying. I gave my brother my headphones while they were playing some sort of true crime video. 

I didn’t receive a trial for some reason so while they were walking me to jail the scenery was really nice (and they ordered 3 drinks, not alcohol but like iced coffee. I asked for one but one of the 2 cops walking me said no and the other cop spilled his drink.) Also when I was walking, I got yelled at for looking back lmao. 

I almost got murdered in jail by Yuka Takaoka. She had murdered everyone else in our little set up (almost like an apartment). I was able to yell for help and I had options (in this part, talking looked like stardew valley which ig is my fault for playing it so much.)

Open minds only please...

This is going to be very long and convoluted so bear with me, it may not seem like it but to me this needs some careful thought.

About 3 months or so ago I got home from being out and found a handwritten letter on my kitchen counter from my wife saying that our 17 year partnership and 12 year marriage was over. We had not had a single conversation about this and it came totally out of the blue. It has totally traumatised me and rocked me to the very core of my being.

That is a separate issue that I will not go into, there is just too much to talk about and it's not relevant to the main issue I'm asking for guidance on. I mentioned it to give you some background info about what has lead me to this point in my life. Note my wife is an evil covert female narcissist...and it is totally over between us.

Prior to her pulling the trigger we had a family trip planned interstate, unbeknownst to me she changed the details of our pre-paid flights to another state with my two kids and I was left with a flight on my own. It was already paid for so I decided to go on my first holiday alone in 17 years.

While I was wondering what to do I had been very emotional and lonely and in need of some female company. I was looking for connection as well as intimacy. I rationalised that I was going to see an escort and started looking online for someone who I thought would be suitable, considering I was newly single and heartbroken.

I found one woman in particular who ticked all of the boxes for me, she was smart, funny, genuinely kind and warm as well as drop dead gorgeous so I decided to send her an email inquiry about her services and we went from there.

Well within the hour I had a bible long email full of emoji's and substance that I had not expected at all! It really lit me up to think that the hunch I had about this woman from viewing her online profile turned out to be correct, she was just what I had expected. Over the next 18 days we sent emails back and forth almost daily. Long descriptive emails about our lives, our experiences and sometimes just about our day. We both made each other laugh and shared some really personal things about our lives. At one stage we emailed each other at EXACTLY the same time (well 4 minutes apart) meaning we were composing an email to each other at the same time (it had been about 4 days in between emails) so that was mind blowing too!

We racked up around 25 emails back and forth in total and with each message we were getting more and more into each other. We had lots in common, it was almost eerie how similar we were. This was all verified when I met her in person so I can safely say there was no lying or manipulating going on here during the correspondence. I figured out early on in that she was being 100% genuine with me and that made the whole experience so much more exciting! This woman is also a woman of faith (I know right some major duality going on here) and she was extremely attentive, caring and warm towards me. For the record I'm not religious at all and this came as a big surprise for me. She does not drink and has never done drugs in her life before, allegedly.

It turned out that we were both extremely lonely and in serious need of an intellectual connection, we found that with each other during our correspondence. This started to go into the realm of emotional connection too when we found out other very personal things about each other on our in-person dates.  Things that we couldn't lie about, let's just say for the record that we were 100% honest with each other and there was no lying or manipulation going on. I know how naive it may sound but some grown up men and women don't want or like to play games.

When we finally met up we had some serious sparks flying, as we felt like we knew each other for years before we met in person. We had a breakfast date where we just had a coffee and some food and talked about our lives and experiences. The date went great. We had even more in common than we originally thought and this connection we had just kept getting deeper and deeper. The eye contact and body language was real, we made each other laugh, she ran 20 minutes overtime (these women are usually always watching the clock and hate running overtime!) and we ended up sharing an amazing goodbye kiss at the end of our date. Later that day she sent me a text saying how much she enjoyed it (the kiss) and that she was really looking forward to our dinner date the next night.

The next day came around really quickly and we had been texting each other almost constantly since the breakfast date. Unbeknownst to me it turns out I had gone out for lunch on my own to her favourite restaurant and even ate her favourite meal and had absolutely no idea! This was just one of many strange synchronicities that cropped up during our time together. Our kids were roughly the same age, we had been married the same length of time and had been with our partners for a similar amount of time (17 and 18 years respectively).

So the dinner date came around and she rocked up looking absolutely stunning, she put much more effort into her appearance and wore a skin tight white dress which just looked expensive (she said she usually wore black for dinner dates) we walked from my hotel to the restaurant I had chosen, we held hands the whole way there and didn't let go once (it was about a 10 minute walk). At dinner we had some very personal talks where she shared stories about her father and how he had physically abused her as a teenager, that her mother was a pushover and didn't protect her from him and that she was an only child. All of those facts pertain to me as well, our fathers are narcissists and mothers weak. Being an only child is like being an alien...theres not many of us around and I can safely say I've never met another in my life. As you can imagine our connection got even deeper and soon it was time to leave and head back to the hotel.

I got up off my chair and started to.walk to the pay-station to pay the bill as we held hands through the crowded restaurant. I let go of her hand to pay the bill and instead of holding my hand she caressed my arm instead, she never stopped being affectionate towards me. We walked back to my hotel hand in hand and proceeded to go to my suite.

She decided to ""freshen up"" straight away and got in the shower, she changed into her black lingerie and came out to the lounge where I was sat and sidled up next to me on the couch. She said to me ""I just want to ask one question...why me? Out of all of the beautiful women you could have chosen...why me?"" this showed me that she had some major self esteem issues going on as she rolls her eyes and scoffs at any compliment you try and give her about her physical appearance. She is very humble like that and her low self esteem showed.

I told her it was because of her heart and left it at that. Her warm genuine personality lifted my spirits when I was at my lowest point in life and she basically saved me. I was suicidal after my wife left me and her warm attentive nature was just what I needed to go on. She never knew this...she came to me at the right time.

So after that little interlude we made our way to the bedroom for some intimate time. I'm a gentleman so I'm not going into the finer details but I will say this VERY important point. While we were getting very hot and heavy in the foreplay section of the encounter she straddled me on top...next thing I knew I was inside her with no rubber! She just stuffed me inside her effortlessly (no lube needed here) with absolutely no hesitation whatsoever...for anyone who is new to this type of thing this is not common practice at all! In fact, most girls say that they never ever offer this service and if you ask you will have your booking terminated on the spot! I did not ask...I was not expecting it or really interested in a natural service but she did it on her own accord so in that moment this absolutely blew my mind!!!

There and then I thought that I must be a special person in her life to go there, this is a strict boundary, something she admitted to me ""she never does"" and escorts usually only let there boyfriends or husbands fuck them raw like that. Clients wear rubbers, partners don't. I knew this fact before she did what she did so to me the connection we had plus this meant it was more serious than I first thought, in my mind anyway.

So we have our time together and it is just as amazing as you would expect it to be. We had an intermission half way through, interlaced our legs together and held each other while talking about our connection and that we both felt it growing over the past weeks. We both really enjoyed ourselves and she ended up leaving 40 minutes later than she should have! I gave her a few gifts which were personal not bought (books etc.) and she left. Just outside the lift she said I could ""call or email her anytime"" and gave me three kisses in a row...real kisses...kisses you give a loved one when they are leaving and you don't know when you will ever see them again.

That night I texted her and told her what a wonderful time I had. She replied that night thanking me not only for the night and the gifts but for the last 18 days of correspondence too. Said thank you for making her feel ""seen, heard and understood"". Said that I was a ""true gentleman"", that she ""wouldn't hesitate to see me again"" and that she would ""love that"".

I flew back to my home state the next day and I texted her in the evening when I had gotten home just letting her know I had returned home safely. She messaged me back later in the day, her tone was different and her mannerisms were all off but still cordial and pleasant. She is a major introvert so I thought she might have been upset?

I texted her the next day about some random occurrence in my day that I thought she would find funny and did not get a reply. I sent her an email as well saying I had booked another trip for 3 months from now and asked if she was available and wanted to see me again. That was around 20 days ago and I still haven't had a reply yet. She did say on her social media that she was having a break over the Xmas/New Year period and she wasn't attending to work matters until after then. She posted that roughly the same day I had sent my inane text message and email. So I felt comfortable and didn't expect to get a reply, she put up a boundary to protect her inner peace from her clients (me included) and I fully respected that and have not sent another email or text since.

Now I am waiting for her to get back to me and it's honestly killing me. I saw she posted a Happy New Year post and that she was slowly making her way through her work phone and hadn't gotten to the work emails yet. That was a few days ago. So now I am waiting for a reply and hoping to restart the connection and correspondence again as I really feel for this woman and she cares about me and my plight of impending divorce and custody matters with my ex. Said I should reach out if I ""needed an ear"".

My question...is there enough logical evidence here for me to pursue this further? She has said (not to me personally) that she is ""happy being single"" and does not want a relationship but she has literally contradicted every single thing she has said. ""I will never run overtime for a booking"", ""I don't offer natural services and if you ask you will have your booking cancelled"", ""I never do this"". It is also an important note that she never asked me to pay her for the ""service"" upfront, which is also strange as they usually ask you pay them before they do ANYTHING at all. I had a breakfast date, a dinner date, hours of sex as well as overtime and she never asked me for a dime. I did however pay her in full but she didn't open the envelope until she was out of the hotel which seems like a rookie mistake to me considering she has been in the industry for a few years.

What the hell do I do? Do I pursue this any further? Surely this isn't business as usual? I've had other experiences with other working girls in the past and they were nothing like this woman, note all three of these ladies were very expensive ""high end"" courtesans. The two I had before were great actors, totally  Oscar worthy and ice cold, did not run overtime and did not offer any service which I had not paid for in full before I had even gotten in the shower. One of them was very disappointing in bed too which was even worse!

Am I being naive here? Did I imagine that she was into me when it was just her job? Either I believe everything she said or I believe nothing she said but I know most of what she told me was 100% true so what do I believe? She was also probing me with questions about whether I was going to divorce my wife, whether I wanted to stay in the state I live and why I decided to stay with her when I was being mistreated. Loaded questions from my perspective.

We live in different states, we have families and commitments, she still lives with her ex-husband (in the same house!!) which I could not believe. She says she ""hates his fucking guts"" yet lives in the same house as him with their kids. She told me constantly how he disappears all the time and is usually ""balls deep in younger women pushing coke up his nose"" I said you need to kick him out and she just said it was ""too hard"" which I thought was a cop out considering I do not even want to be in the same room as my ex wife! I asked if he was violent and she said no but he could be verbally and emotionally abusive.

She said she has been single for 8 years but only in the industry for 3. It is all starting to make less and less sense the more I write about it. I really need a female perspective on this one...it's boggling my mind. To me she's either lying through her teeth and she took advantage of my vulnerability or she is 100% genuine and actually cares. Stupidly I am starting to fall for this woman and now I'm facing the possibility of a double heartbreak stacked on top of the other. It's tragic...please help...",0,1736002332.0,relationship_advice,24,0.38,False

I still don't have any publish quality data neither do I have any bare minimum help/guidance from my professor. I am completely on my own. But thankfully, last year, I managed to get a project and seems like I can get some data by this year. 
On top of that 1.5 years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD that was really devastating for me to accept. I started taking medication but only medication didn't seem to help much. 
As a side effect of ADHD, I also developed an anxiety disorder thinking of constant negativity related to my phD, got severe panick attacks 3 times in these whole time. Later, counselling sessions really helped me to find out behavior modifications that seem to be singnificaly helpful for me. Gratefully, from last few months, I stated doing really well mentally as I learned to accept myself and working towards a happy life.
Me and my husband planned to have baby next year after I submit my thesis and also to give myself some time to recover from my bad habits (working at night/ not sleeping or eating for 30 hrs/only having coffee etc). 
But last week i find out I am pregnant for the first time. I am absolutely not ready for it at this stage of my life where I am still gathering myself. Besides, we live abroad where we are completely on our own and will have no help. The first thought was, terminating the pregnancy but I am feeling immense guilt about it (hysterically crying without knowing the exact reason) causing me a second thought of continuing it. I am sacred how I would manage both my pregnancy and phD together with ADHD. 
Can anyone please share your experience if someone went through similar situation and how you managed your emotion.

He had no time to figure out what was happening on the drive.,"Jake parked and walked into the diner, its lights brightening up the dead dark night.

He was famished, not having eaten for hours. Although there wasn’t much longer to drive and he was desperate to see his mother, he had to get a bite. It was better to eat now, than show up at the hospice hungry and unable to focus on what was happening.

Inside the diner was as comforting as the lights promised. A few patrons were dotted around the red tables, hands curled around steaming mugs, faces dipped towards plates of comfort food. He couldn’t smell anything, and he noticed that, and the silence. No clinking of cutlery, no coffee and bacon aroma.

He’d been driving along the highway for hours, focused on getting to his mother while keeping his looming grief at bay. His senses were out of joint.

There was nothing wrong with the hot plate of food the server pushed over to him. He couldn’t remember what he ordered, just that it was plentiful and warm. He shovelled it into his mouth, feeling the goodness radiating along his tired limbs. He sipped the coffee, and it flowed through his veins, lifting the veil of fatigue, and he looked around. The server was pretty.

But he couldn’t risk arriving late. The hospice staff had been kind, but clear.

He pushed his credit card to the pretty server. She smiled broadly, and said something- he couldn’t hear, or understand. “On the house”? Why?

He didn’t have time to discuss. He pocketed his wallet, nodded, and headed out. He almost missed the door, narrowly avoiding walking into the wall.

He looked back at the diner, its twinkling lights still advertising “DINER” “OPEN”– the only lights visible. The windows were dark.

What?

He didn’t have time - he had to get to his mother.

But he needed gas. There was a gas station just on the other side of the highway. He drove in, the first rays of dawn piercing the darkness.

Pumping gas, he glanced over his shoulder. In the grey light, he couldn’t see the diner lights. No building.

The other side of the highway was emptyness.

Jake cried out. An elderly man pumping next to him looked up.

“Son?”

 “There was a diner there” muttered Jake, and his free hand pointed across the highway to the grey nothingness.

The man said grimly “Son, you’re not from around here if you don’t know what happened there. That diner closed after all that hullabaloo, and got torn down few years back. Nobody was eating there no more”

Jake stood quite still. He could still feel the warmth of the food in his body, the aftertaste of coffee in his mouth. He looked at the old man, who was minding his business pumping gas.

He needed to get back on the road. He had to get to his mother.

And I can’t think of an excuse to message her beforehand.

so what do I do? I want to meet her in person so I can get a feel for the actual vibe and then decide if I try and peruse her or see if I made a new friend. any advice for how to talk to her more?

Once you eat/drink a “trigger” food, how long does it take until it can start a flare up? 

For example, if I have a tiny but of coffee one morning will I expect to see the flare up immediately? In two hours? I ask this because my flare ups typically happen at night no matter what (even if I DON’T have coffee in the AM). So if my flare up happens at night, how am I supposed to determine if it’s the result of a food or not? 

I use coffee as a loose example, but I hope you know what I mean. Not understanding the timeline of when a trigger food can cause a flare up, is making it difficult for me to understand which foods are okay for my body and which foods aren’t.

But I feel like I’m also a loser, like I lost, I’m gonna lose more than half my stuff, not because my girl is some evil mastermind but I’m basically forced to down size living arrangements and find a room mate.  Most room situations I’ve seen online all have the bedrooms furnished.  I have a couch, a coffee table, a washer/dryer, a cat, and a mattress.  When we started out I made more than my girl did, and I paid for more of the rent, some months I paid for all the rent, I mean 3 years later now she’s making more, and I guess I’m proud of her for making more, but she’s going to California to leave the home state finally something I’ve always wanted to do but couldn’t because I was with her, we were on our own, and I was paying for the bills.  

And what really fucks with my head is like, she acts like she hates me, but she broke up with me, and it’s over me just not being a Christian.  😂 , man she knew that before we even started dating and now after 3 years it finally matters? I didn’t even care about all that shit or that she supports Trump for whatever reason, lol, 😂.  I remember her even saying how little religion mattered to her how she didn’t care what religion her man was as long as he was a good man. this shit just kinda leaves me bitter, I mean wtf am I supposed to feel like, mostly feeling depressed cause I’ll have to start all over.

Just pulled my third shot on the Gaggia e24 and it’s great so far, except for one thing- I’ve only used others’ Breville and La Marzocco machines and both had much better lock in for the portafilter. When cold it’s okay, but my issue is that when the machine is heated up the portafilter gets tighter and REALLY hard to take out and in. Also, I find there to be too much espresso with the stock double shot basket (I get a screw imprint) even with only using ~17ish g of coffee. The portafilter won’t even fit in the group head with the normcore puck screen. 

Is this all normal? Is the problem with the stock basket(any recs) or do I go down with coffee amount more? I bought a gaggia bottomless portafilter so it’s on the way, but wondering since this might happen with that too.

I did notice we were being more distant so I would ask if she was okay, or if she preferred to speak to her therapist. Anytime I would bring something up like a situation that was really bad she would get upset and start a fight causing us to stop talking to each other for a day sometimes. She then got a letter from her older sister F31 which led to her spiraling to someone I no longer knew. She was more secretive, tired, prone to arguments over simple things, and just overall was not longer the person I fell in love with. Best way to describe my partner is that one day we were at a public area eating while she was on her work break, we had sat down and were eating she then gets approached by a random stranger that then grabbed a sandwich that was still wrapped she then told him"" if your hungry I can buy you another one or did you want me to buy you a soup Its really good!"" she responded with nothing but love while I got upset for her.  He was actually a security guard that likes to tease patrons to see how they would react when he would harass them for there food, he then explained has never had that response for that situation before and apologized to her informing her that she's a sweet heart. Now that I've slightly described her this new personality was completely opposite of her we've always been open with communication and, open with any feedback with our boundaries. I wont lie that I am no angel nor have I been the best partner I have not been perfect no one is every relationship has its ups and downs including ours.

She had been acting so strange that I started pushing her to open up or see her therapist more often which led to more frequents arguments due to me also going to therapy for my own faults/ past trauma which she is aware of. These arguments kept getting more heated each time to the point she finally admitted how she felt that she had been spiraling out of control due to her sisters letter how she expected more out of the relationship including how she wanted me to go back to school. So I acknowledge that she wanted or saw more potential in me so I go back to school this summer for a certification including doing some pre-reqs for a associates I've been aiming for that I let go due to needing to support my partners lifestyle.  It was a agreement on both parties at the time when I volunteered to take some time off school while she worked on her degree, so while I worked on mine this time this year she needed to get some procedures done while I was going to school. During this time she didn't really have anyone to rely on with this minor procedures that I had to take time off work and, miss school sometimes to take care of her. Those days did take a toll in our relationship mainly because she was on FMLA and had to not work she's always been a busy bee so staying home was horrible for her, I didn't mind taking care of her allowed me to baby her for a bit. After two weeks of being post-op I had taken her to the ER once the second time she took her self while I was at school without letting me know. This led to her being more distant from me confused on why this was happening I kept asking if she was okay, bringing her favorite snacks from time to time to see if she would speak to me after being fed. All I kept getting was a cold shoulder to the point I was close to finishing the semester we were walking our dogs and she hits me with that she wants to move to CA to go to school and that when she leaves she wanted to end our relationship? Which I was confused about due to me sometimes working out of state or being away for a while to do work or family things we were used to and have been together for so long that long distance was an option.  I bring up that we dont have to end that we can do long distance where she brings up a comment I made back when we had first started dating that I had made about long distance relationships would be a dealbreaker for me which was when I was extremely younger and less mature.

After that day our relationship started taking more due to us living together I wont lie I was also giving her the cold shoulder. For 2 weeks we sat in silence without really communicating except the simple lets get food or coffee ordeal to the point I had enough and asked her what she really wanted. This was close to my birthday and had hoped we would have fixed whatever was going on. She then gives me another bomb that she wants me to leave her and that it would be best if we separated. That same day I had packed called my only option that I thought I only had which was my mom and went back to stay with my mom. During this whole time we stopped communicating we had dogs so I had taken them with me. She then messages me randomly that she had gone to her therapist and was told ""dont do anything drastic that would create her to regret her decision"" . She then starts asking me to get back with her and that she was diagnosed with PTSD due to her relationship with her mother and sister. This caused more questions then answers  but I was desperate for her so we got back together.

During the time she was now taking medication and going to her therapy appointments we were doing great and, had re-ignited a spark. This only lasted for a period of time until these last two weeks where she started acting more coldly to me more spiteful. I had started a new positions within the company I am at which is closer to her job as well I was working miles away from home wasting gas and money everyday so I thought it would make us closer but seems to had made us more distant. This week she had told me that I've controlled her by choosing her freinds telling her who she can hangout with and not? Which was completely abnormal from our previous conversations over the years. We had communicated over the years that we can have freinds as long as they respected both out boundaries as a couple we had also encouraged each other to hangout with freinds or people that are not just each other. I will be honest during the time we had our break she had messaged her old best friend from California that had offered her to fly her down and take her to Disney world which I told her was a strange line to cross if she was working things with me at the time.  I really dont want to paint her in a bad light but I also dont want to make it seem like I ever told her in the past she could not have guy freinds it was just strange that someone was willing to drop that much cash on a person and not expect something else? Hence why I did not want her communicating with that specific person other times I always encouraged her to go out with coworkers and social freinds her fraternity and so forth. I would also like to add that a couple of months prior she was having work drama about getting a new position offered to her when a best friend of her that worked with her had also applied but my partner had gotten that job instead of her coworker causing her to lose that entire friend group.  So I do know that she was a bit devasted and more lonely due to that but I was trying my best to cheer her up and encourage her to find new people at her new position which she works healthcare so it can be toxic from the tea she had given me.

Now back to today I had enough once again and asked why she's been more rude and distant including avoiding me to the point where she's been picking up extra shifts to not be home. She stated that she was overwhelmed including , that I have not given her any space I have been to clingy and, that she was self sabotaging the relationship again.  I asked if there was anyone else or if she no longer loved me she kept saying she cares about me but just does not like that theres so much pressure for her to be there for me. She keeps confusing me about things she changes personalities super quickly to being cold then lovey dovey via text I just dont know how to help her or if this is the end of our relationship. Did did also mention that she stopped taking her meds a bit and stopped going to therapy due to her therapist being out of town due to the holidays.

TDLR; Partner had been having a hard time I thought I was being a good partner she hits me with she wants to leave to another state end relationship, also stated has PTSD due to a letter and her relationship with her sister and mother. Shes usually a sweet person were usually very communicative we break up once she gets her dx's we get back together . We then have the same problems which she admits not taking her medication nor seeing her therapist.

My Grandma (86) fell and broke her hip at the beginning of November, she's always been super forgetful to the point of yelling the same thing out to my Grandpa (90+) and Dad( (61) when they are outside working on things.   
But recently, since she's gotten home, she's been super confused and I think she's hallucinating.  
For the past few days my Grandma, when my Grandpa asks her to drink some water, will pick up a magnifying glass and start searching for something. When he asks her what she's looking for she says ""The W"". She would always do word search puzzles to keep her mind sharp and she couldn't do them in the hospital, or at the Recovery/Rehab Center because she was forced to lay on her back in bed flat.   
She's been getting worse and my Grandpa is making things even worse.   
I know he's stressed, I understand his side. But you don't say in front of her that ""This is the end"" and that he wants her in a nursing home because he feels like he's not caring for her right. She was in tears and he didn't even seem to care that he hurt her feelings. Since then she's been doing even worse.   
She won't drink any water or coffee, she refuses to walk to the potty chair (can't think of the proper name right now), and she is rolling her eyes at him.   
Last night he rushed her to the ER for literally no reason. She didn't want to go to the bathroom and get up because she was so tired and week. He's been keeping her up all night changing her diaper every time she does a small tinkle. He's also been making her sleep in a chair and he's been sleeping on the couch because he won't let her go upstairs. Which she could go upstairs BEFORE she came home, but now she's suddenly too weak to.   
He's just been driving my Dad crazy, constantly calling and saying crazy things like ""It won't be long now until she passes away."" But here's the kicker. He doesn't want an in-home care aide to come in. He tried to force the Hosptial to keep her overnight. He literally told my Dad that he was going to refuse to bring her home, so they'd keep her and put her in a Nursing Home.   
Thank God my Aunt was with them and she took her home. I'm just so upset. I'm going to their house today, because I worry about my Grandma and she's so lonely.   
Also, this morning at 8 AM he called my Dad panicking because she got a nosebleed. It's so dry and hot in their house that even my Aunt (who stayed overnight to keep an eye on her) said she had trouble sleeping on the couch. Thankfully I told my Dad the proper way to stop a nosebleed and within 10 minutes it stopped. But he was trying to take her to the ER again, before he even called my Dad they were getting ready to go to the ER. I know he's worried but I just feel like he doesn't care anymore.   
It's hurting my Grandma and she's the only one I'm worried about right now. I know I should feel worried about Grandpa.  
I need to add that I'm going to be doing as much as I can for them, making food and helping out, as well as my parents. But all 3 of us are disabled. We're going to be contacting someone to come into the home asap to help take care of her.

1htfqsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1htfqsm/still_in_need_of_clarification/,Still in need of clarification...,"Hello, everyone.  Sorry, this is going to be somewhat long.

I was actually diagnosed with the MTHFR mutation a couple of years ago by a local psychiatrist who ran an extensive number of tests on me.  However, I hadn't focused on it too much since then as he sort of brushed past it after explaining it briefly and then recommended a barrage of supplements for a number of things (which he gets commissions for - but that's another story).  I have been taking the 5-MTHF supplement from Thorne since then, and I suppose it has made some difference, but I have been dealing with issues around foggy-headedness and inability to focus for years now.

I live in California's central valley and have also been dealing with allergy issues more and more since I turned 40 (I am 45 now), and I have long since blamed the foggy headedness on internal inflammation.  I have a near-genius IQ (seriously not bragging, just important to clarify here), work full-time in IT and all of this can really affect my work.  I've really been trying to take steps to address all of this over the past year and am finally seeing an allergist for immunotherapy, though it is now winter and I don't normally have problems with airborne allergies until the spring.  I also took a food allergy test a few months ago and have since been avoiding everything that came up on that test... it seems like that has made a significant difference and I feel better overall, but still, I maybe have one or two days a week where my brain feels like it is at peak performance, which the rest of the week I feel like I'm somewhere between 70% to 90% at best.

I found this subreddit about a month ago and have been coming back here to search for tips, but there are so many variations in diagnoses from person to person that it seemed better to just post my results here and see what recommendations I get.

Other things to know...

I don't drink alcohol or smoke (it's been eight years now).  I don't drink coffee or even soda, but I do drink a cup or two of oolong tea every day, which has maybe half the caffeine content of coffee.  I have been experimenting with cutting out caffeine entirely over the past few days... this is difficult, but I feel like it may be beneficial.

My current regiment (I printed this out and have it on the wall of my office):

Methylated B6  - Every 2 Days at Most

Methylated B12 - Every Day at Most

Thorne Methylated B-Complex (instead of above) - Every 2 Days at Most

Creatine - 5mg - Before Exercise

Thorne 5-MTHF 5mg - Twice Daily|

Zinc - Twice Daily

Lifeseasons Inflamma-X - Every 2 Days at Most

Bodywise Super EPA - 1 to 2 Daily

Red Yeast Rice with CoQ10 - 1 to 2 Daily

Lithium Orotate - 1 Before Bed

Vitamin D + K2 Drops - 3 to 4 Drops Daily

AVOID SUGAR (Especially after dinner)

**Sleep:** Normally 10PM to 11PM bedtime, but 9PM to 9:30PM as needed.  Some 6+ hour nights of sleep may be required. (5.5 hours a night is normal for me and I usually can't force myself to sleep longer if I try.  I use a FitBit to track sleep, and I normally get a sleep score around 90... sleep isn't really an issue).

**Exercise:** Walk/Jog 4 to 5 days per week in the mornings.

My test results:

**Bonus Question:** I don't like taking any painkillers at all as they seem to add to my foggy headedness and recently found [this PDF](https://prohealthseminars.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nutrient_depletion_chart.pdf), which shows that Naproxen (Aleve) depletes the body of Folic Acid... I am wondering if having an MTHFR mutation means that there is some way we need to supplement taking an NSAID like this.

2) Extended Fasting: 37 hours of fasting or more (although research studies show 48 hours) Will help reboot your dopamine system. This will increase your motivation in life.
3) Low carb diet: Carby meals cause blood sugar spike and crash. During the crash is when you are more susceptible to relapse. Also carb diet triggers you to crave food, sex, attention, validation.
4) Know your triggers: For me, it is loneliness, a high carb diet, dating apps, disappointments like failed date, or failed job interviews. Avoid being at home alone when you aren’t fasting.

I have a MiiCoffee D40+ with a Rancillio Silvia V1. I bought the grinder at about mid november and have been using it since but I’ve been having a hard time maintaining a consistent shot. 

I’m dosing by volume, so I found that the ideal dose for my basket is 17g and therefore going for 1:2 ratio in 30 seconds (17g in 34g out in 30 seconds). 
 
Every shot I extract i’m having to adjust my grind size because it’s either going faster or slower and it’s getting a little bit frustrating. About two days ago  I had to adjust the dial from 3.5 all the way down to 2.5 so I could get back to getting slower shots again. 

I’m doing the best I can for puck prepping, i’m “shaking” the dosing cup into te portafilter to sorta “aerate and declump” the grinds i’m doing WDT, RDT, levelling off and tamping. 

I’m also thinking that the coffee beans I’m using might just be inconsistent. I’m using Yaucono which is a big coffee name brand here in Puerto Rico but i’ve gone with a more “specialty” kind of bean which is their dark roast edition but i’m starting to think that these guys just get different coffee beans from different suppliers and mix them all together.

She's dating this guy and his name is Nick and he's 20 something. 

They always seem so loving and seem to have a strong bond, however that seemed to have changed recently.

In short what happened was my sister was telling me on facetime about how she isn't so happy in her relationship anymore and wants to leave and that she started talking to this new guy she met off tinder and is a local in our area. I told that's fine and to just break up with him over coffee or something (They don't live together). She thought it was a good idea.

Today my sister banged on my apartment door begging to be let in, she was bleeding on her lip, she was panting, and covering her eye. I asked what the hell happened?

She said Nick had hit her after she told him about breaking up and that she was talking to a different guy. I backtracked and explained why she didn't break up with him before if she didn't like the relationship, she thought he would perhaps change. I then explained she somewhat deserved it because she TECHNICALLY cheated on him and he got mad which is understandable (I don't condone cheating)

I told my sister she could stay with me for a few days if she needed to but had to eventually leave because I wasn't pleased with her cheating on Nick and trying to downplay it. I called our parents and explained the situation and they called me an AH and a bad brother. The rest of the family seems divided on it too because our cousin Fran reached out to me and told me they are both shitty for doing this to each other.

Hello r/iosgaming !


I've posted here previously about the game I've been developing, WalkScape. In short, it's an MMORPG inspired by RuneScape where you gain progress by walking in real life. Steps are counted even if the app is not open, so every step you take while your phone is in your pocket is counted for.

The game is currently in Closed Beta, and we have an open wave right now until 7th of January. You can start playing the game instantly if you support the development through our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/WalkScape) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walkscape). You can also check https://walkscape.app/help for more instructions on how to join, including joining the queue for the Closed Beta if you don't want to or can't support the development!

I'm an indie dev and we have three other people working on the game, and I want to emphasize that this game **will not be P2W** or have any predatory monetisation practises. The idea came to me as I'm a computer scientist student who is sitting a lot and I also have ADHD and needed a game to motivate myself to be more active. So combining RuneScape style game to walking felt like a great combination to get myself up and walking.

For more information about the game, I recommend to check out the [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjaQeb5Rapg) to the game or check out r/WalkScape and our website. We have currently around 20k people in the Closed Beta. The game is available for Android and iOS, and we're planning the Open Beta release for this year.

I'll be here answering any comments and questions about the game! Thank you all, and happy walking ❤️",30,1736000539.0,iosgaming,2,0.9,False
1htfc2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/theassholeclub/comments/1htfc2v/navigating_the_jungle_of_workplace_assholes_a/,Navigating the Jungle of Workplace Assholes: A Survival Guide,"

Hey there, fellow office warriors!

Let’s face it: some days at work feel like you’ve entered an episode of *Survivor.* You’re dodging passive-aggressive comments, navigating through awkward silences, and trying to figure out if that sweet smile from Kyle in accounting is genuine or just another attempt to distract you as he “forgets” to share the quarterly report. Ah, yes, the joys of dealing with workplace assholes!

But fear not! 😄 We’re here to commiserate, share a laugh, and maybe even arm you with some tools to survive the tumultuous tides of office life. 

### 1. **The Gaslighter**
You know them—the ones who make you question your sanity. “Didn’t I send that email?” ""Don’t you remember me sharing that idea?"" Newsflash: they probably forgot, and that’s okay! Just remember, you’re not losing your mind. Keep a folder of evidence (aka ""The Truth Vault"") on your computer for those moments when you need to remind them of reality. Perhaps add a catchy title like “Kyle’s Greatest Hits: Classic Gaslighting Moments.”

### 2. **The Drama Magnet**
Some people thrive on chaos. They could turn a simple coffee break into an Olympics-worthy drama fest. When they start spiraling into another long-winded tale about the copier jam that “ruined their entire week,” give a knowing nod and practice your “active listening” face. You may not care that the paper jam was “totally on the level of a natural disaster,” but pretending to care can sometimes save you from the next 20 minutes of rattling anecdotes. 

### 3. **The Silent Treatment Specialist**
Ah, the silent treatment—a classic! Whether it’s due to a small misunderstanding or just because they woke up on the wrong side of the bed, acknowledging it requires some finesse. If they’re giving you the cold shoulder, crack a joke like, “Did I forget to compliment your shoes today, or are they just silently judging me?” Laughter can break the tension faster than a content spreadsheet.

### 4. **The Know-It-All**
You know the type: every meeting feels like you’ve stumbled into a TED Talk led by a self-proclaimed genius. While their input may make you want to bang your head against the desk, try to see the humor in their antics. Ask them a simple question, and watch as they launch into a full PowerPoint presentation about staplers. The next time they go off on a tangent, silently create a bingo card to mark each “I know” occurrence. You’ll be chuckling to yourself in no time!

### 5. **The Perpetual Blamer**
Some folks can’t let a mistake go without pointing fingers. If you find yourself in the crosshairs of someone who insists that “everything is your fault,” just remember: you can’t control their attitude, but you can control your response. Try a little humor: “You know, if I had a dollar for every time you blamed me for something, I could buy us all a cake to celebrate our teamwork!” Who can resist a cake?

### 6. **The Office Gossip**
Gossip, while juicy, can be damaging. If you catch wind of yet another round of rumors, don’t take the bait! Simply smile and say, “Ah, it sounds like the plot of the next big Netflix drama.” Redirect the conversation to something healthier (like the latest office snacks!). Setting a positive tone not only shields you from the toxic negativity but also raises the spirits of those around you.

### Final Thoughts: Love and Laughter

Dealing with workplace assholes can be frustrating, but give yourself permission to find the funny side. We’re all human. At the end of the day, we might just be colleagues navigating our way through the wild world of office politics together. Use humor as your shield and empathy as your sword. Everyone’s fighting their own battles, even the office jerks, and a little kindness goes a long way (even if it means simply smiling as you walk past their dramatic monologue).

So take a deep breath, laugh it off, and remember: at least you’re not in this alone! 

Cheers to surviving another day at the office! 🥳👩‍💻👨‍💻",2,1736000439.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False
