She’s supposed to be on the road 3 out of 4 weeks per month. She thinks if she grinds now it can ease up a bit later. She told me it would be like this, and now that it’s like this, it’s hard and she’s not very sympathetic about it being hard on both of us.

I’m turning 34, lol so not exactly a milestone. Also we are DINKs so I acknowledge my life is objectively not hard.

The Science Behind Using Pudding Mix in Ice Cream Making Techniques
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Making ice cream at home can be a delightful and rewarding experience. However, getting that perfect creamy texture sometimes feels like a challenge. One popular method to enhance the richness and creaminess of homemade ice cream is using pudding mix. This technique is becoming a favorite among ice cream enthusiasts, and it’s worth exploring how it works.

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
Pudding mix is primarily made of starch, sweeteners, and flavorings. When you add pudding mix to your ice cream mixture, it plays a significant role in achieving that luxurious texture. The starch in the pudding mix serves as a thickening agent, which helps to create a smoother consistency in the final product. This is especially beneficial when making ice cream at home, where traditional stabilizers and emulsifiers may not be readily available.

Here are some reasons why using pudding mix can elevate your ice cream making:

- **Creaminess:** The starch in pudding mix binds with the liquid ingredients, helping to trap air and creating a lighter, fluffier texture.
- **Stability:** Pudding mix can help prevent ice crystals from forming as the ice cream freezes, which is often a problem with homemade versions. This is crucial for maintaining a creamy mouthfeel.
- **Flavor:** They come in various flavors, allowing you to infuse your ice cream with unique tastes easily.
- **Sweetness:** Most pudding mixes contain sweeteners that can enhance the overall flavor of your ice cream without needing additional sugar.

To create your own vanilla ice cream using pudding mix, start with a basic recipe that includes heavy cream, milk, and sugar. You can make this vanilla ice cream even richer by incorporating the pudding mix. Here’s a fantastic Ninja Creami Vanilla Ice Cream recipe that utilizes vanilla pudding mix as a delicious hack.

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
**Ingredients:**

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 box (3.4 ounces) vanilla pudding mix
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Follow these simple steps to create your ice cream:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, and vanilla pudding mix until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
2. Add the vanilla extract and mix it in thoroughly.
3. Pour the mixture into the Ninja Creami ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. If you prefer a firmer ice cream, place the mixture in the freezer for a few hours after processing.

This ice cream will have a delightful creaminess and flavor that’s hard to beat! The pudding mix hack not only ensures a luscious texture but also simplifies the ice cream-making process.

While incorporating pudding mix is a clever trick, it’s essential to understand the science behind it. The key lies in how the starch molecules absorb moisture and expand when heated. When mixed with your ice cream ingredients, they help create a consistent emulsion that keeps air in the mix as it freezes, leading to a rich and creamy texture. The pudding mix stabilizes the ice cream and reduces the chances of forming undesirable ice crystals, making every scoop smooth and enjoyable.

Furthermore, the versatility of using pudding mix enables you to customize your ice cream flavors effortlessly. Consider experimenting with chocolate, banana, or even coconut pudding for unique twists on your vanilla ice cream. Each variation brings distinctive flavors while maintaining that desirable creaminess.

It’s an exciting twist on traditional recipes, allowing you to create delicious frozen treats with minimal effort. So, grab your ingredients and get ready to enjoy a homemade ice cream experience that rivals store-bought versions—all thanks to the wonders of pudding mix!

### Conclusion

Experimenting with the Ninja Creami Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe using pudding mix opens up a world of delightful flavors and textures.

**Memory transcription subject: Lerai, Venlil Fighter**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 29th, 2136. Eight hours before previous transcription.*

\++++++++++

I was tending to the nectar drops, enjoying the sweet taste in the air around them, when another groundskeeper approached me. Coron, a fellow Venlil. One of my coworkers who avoided me due to my *hereditary PD.*

“Uh, h-hey, Lerai…” he stammered, like I was about to chop his head off with my gardening shears. He’d always been an anxious one. “N-Naartis wants to see you.”

“Hmm? What for?” I asked, glancing at him and stopping my shears.

“H-He didn’t say.”

*…What’s this about?*

With a confused tail-swish, I pushed myself to my feet, brushing the dirt off my damp knees and heading towards our main site. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him breathe a small sigh of relief and stand up a little straighter as I walked past him, and it made my ears pin back in frustration.

As I entered the main site, a few gave me discreet side-eyes as I walked past, silencing their conversations and watching me go as they tracked me with their ears. What was going on? This was worse than usual…

I shook my head. *Don’t let them get to you, Lerai… let’s just see what Naartis wants, and then you can get back to your work claw.*

Soon, I was standing in front of the door to Naartis’s office. My fist rose, and I hesitated only slightly before knocking. “Sir? It’s Lerai. You wanted to see me.”

“Yes, yes, come in,” came the Kolshian’s voice.

I put a paw on the door handle, before noticing my tail had gone stiff. I was too tense. Taking a deep breath, I tried to force myself to be calm. Whatever he wanted, it was probably nothing…

My paw turned, and the door opened enough for me to peek my face through. Naartis was sitting at his desk in the center of his neat, prim, and proper office, watching me with bulbous eyes. His tentacles were placed under his chin, slightly obscuring his mouth.

“Welcome, Lerai,” he greeted neutrally. A tentacle waved towards the chairs on the other side of his desk. “Please, sit.”

I flicked an ear in approval and slowly stepped into the room, closing the door behind me. All of my earlier tension had returned, and my tail was as stiff as a tree trunk. As I approached, I tried to calm myself again by looking through the window behind him, which had a perfect view of his *personal* garden. A small plot of land right next to the main site where he was completely free to create as he pleased, without needing to take the sensibilities of other people and species into account. One of the luxuries of being a topsoil School of the Flora grad, I suppose.

That said, it wasn’t pretty. It was filled with beautiful and colorful plants and flowers of all kinds from all over the galaxy, but either I didn’t understand Kolshian design philosophy, I couldn’t see the same colors as a Kolshian, or Naartis just didn’t have much sense of aesthetic. All the colors clashed against one another in strange arrangements to turn the garden into an eye-searing mess. Needless to say, it didn’t soothe me at all.

I took a chair and sat, my paws gripping the hard wooden armrests. Naartis’ gaze never wavered.

“...I’d like to talk to you about your attendance recently,” he said, a bit of a hard edge in his voice.

*…My attendance?* My ears couldn’t help but waggle in confusion reflexively. I hadn’t had any issues that I was aware of—at least, nothing that didn’t have a clear explanation.

“What about it?” I asked.

“Well…” Naartis leaned back in his chair, winding his tentacles across his chest with a dismissive expression. “Frankly, Lerai, there have been too many issues as of late.”

*…What?* “Wh-What are you talking about…?” I asked disbelievingly.

Wordlessly, he took out his pad. He tapped away at it for a scratch before placing it on the table. The built-in holodisplay began projecting a chart in the air between us. It was a graph of the employee attendance records. We had thirty-two total groundskeepers maintaining the park, and the paws that they had showed up to work was displayed as a bar. Many of them were green, or at least yellow. Mine was red, and the smallest bar of all.

“Over the last solar pass, you have had the lowest attendance of any employee here at the Starlight Grove City Park,” he said sternly. 

I stared at the chart. “Wh… Naartis, I’ve missed two paws! And one of them was out sick!” I bleated. *That was the paw after I fought Rika the second time. I was too sore to move…*

Leaning forward to get a closer look, I studied the chart carefully. “I… who made this? The lowest point on this chart is seventeen paws worked out of twenty in a pass! This whole thing is intentionally misleading!”

“Regardless of the chart’s appearance, it does not change the fact that your attendance has been poor in comparison to the others,” Naartis replied with a dismissive flick of a tentacle.

“Naartis, I’m allowed to take sick paws! And you know I don’t abuse them!” I argued, my tail waving wildly. What the brahk was his problem? He was a jerk, but he wasn’t *stupid,* he had to know he was being ridiculous. “And you know why I missed the other paw! That was when I was arreste—”

My voice withered, as the seed finally sprouted in my head. *…Wait… is that what this is about?*

“...You may recall that you recently had a no-call-no-show, Lerai,” Naartis’s voice filled the space.

I didn’t respond for a moment. I was still stunned at the… *brazenness* of it all. I’d heard about this sort of thing happening—someone getting hauled in by the exterminators for a PD screening or some minor crime and being held for a paw or two, coming back clean, and then getting punished at their job anyway for missing work. And despite the obvious problem and lack of protection for the workers, many just waved the incidents off as a personal failure. “*Well, if they didn’t want to be punished, they shouldn’t have acted like a predator,”* they’d say.

Most of the time, the business just didn’t want to deal with having someone *potentially dangerous* around. Too much liability. And in many cases, their solution was…

 “...You’re letting me go,” I concluded. “Now that I have an arrest on my record, I’m a burden to the herd.”

Naartis responded by turning his chair sideways, looking out the window into his private garden. “Lerai,” he began. “The paw I hired you, I knew I was taking a risk. But it wasn’t without purpose… there are some incredible artists who are known to have minor cases of Predator Disease. Polohn. Dorlasav. Sematii. All eccentrics who have caused great waves in the vast ocean of art. Perhaps… I hoped I’d find a little pearl of my own, that I could nurture into something greater. Truly, I did see some potential in you.”

Without turning his chair, he glanced back towards me. “...But not all pearls can become true gems, I suppose. This will be your last paw with us.”

…

*F-Fired…*

*…*

Silently, I stood. I turned, and I walked out of the room without so much as a tail-flick, quietly opening the door and shutting it softly behind me. Naartis watched me go without a word.

Turning down the hall, I trudged towards the locker room to go collect my things and leave my apron. Prey of all kinds stopped their conversations and side-eyed me as I went. Did they all know about the arrest? Had Naartis told them?

Well, not like it matters now.

I shuffled into the locker room, entered my code, and quietly took my bag and hoodie. Then I removed my apron and hung it on the hook. My paw went to the locker’s door to shut it.

And I didn’t. I just… numbly stared at the apron for a scratch. Soon, emotions began to swirl inside me. Sadness. Frustration. Anger. My breath began to quicken.

“RRGH!” I slammed the locker shut as hard as I could, and the crashing sound reverberated through the room. Anyone who wasn’t already staring at me definitely was now.

I threw my bag and hoodie over my shoulder, not even bothering to put them on, and stormed out of the room towards the exit. “Stupid Naartis, brahking… ‘oh you saved your dad and sister from getting harassed great job Lerai now as a reward why don’t we FIRE YOU!’” I brayed into the air, not caring who heard me.

As I exited the building into the park and stomped towards the gate, I happened to run into Vyrlo, shoveling fertilizer into a flower bed near the path. His ears perked up as he saw me approach.

“Oh, hey Lerai…” his voice withered and his ears fell. “Ralchi’s light, what’s wrong?” he asked full of concern.

“I was fired,” I muttered darkly, without slowing down.

“Sorry, WHAT?” He looked towards the main building where I’d just come from, then back at me. “What for?!”

“The arrest. Said it was for a no-call no-show, but we know that’s vyalpic.”

“Well, that’s…” He began to follow after me. “Aren’t there supposed to be protections against that kind of thing? I mean, you weren’t even formally accused of PD! Maybe you could sue–”

“It doesn’t matter!” I interrupted with a loud bleat. “I don’t have the money for another lawyer! Syhan cut me a deal since I helped out Parla and it *still* ate up most of my savings! I-I just…”

The anger started to give way to tears. “...I-I’m sorry…” I muttered, before I turned and ran.

“Lerai, wait!” I heard Vyrlo call after me. But I didn’t stop.

Running for the exit, I paused only briefly, right as I reached the gate. There, bordering the fence, was the nectar drop bush I was just tending a few scratches ago.

A little bit of the anger, and a hint of defiance returned. I grabbed a flower and shoved the whole sweet blossom in my mouth, before my feet carried me down the road.

  

\++++++++++

  

It was a while before the frustration began to fade. I found myself sitting on a public bench.

Make no mistake, I was still *really* frustrated. But it was just sort of… aimless. I wanted to go home, and yet I didn’t want to be alone in the house by myself. And yet at the same time, I DID want to be alone. And also I wanted to talk to someone. The swirling conflict in my mind was just annoying me further.

*Maybe I shouldn’t have run from Vyrlo… I could use a friend right now. Stars, I’ve been a terrible herdmate to him. This is twice now I’ve ditched him.*

The thought that I’d been a bad friend was only making me feel even worse. I leaned forward, cupping my face in my palms and sighing. I needed to do *something* besides mope here on a bench\*,\* if only to let out some of this frustration.

Reaching into my bag next to me, I took my pad and sent a message to Vyrlo, just for my peace of mind.

*TwilitFloret: Hey. I’m sorry I ran off.*

A moment later, the pad chimed.

*HarvestDancer: You just got fired and you’re concerned about ME?*

*HarvestDancer: Please, it’s fine. I know the whole thing must have been a shock. Do you want to talk?*

*TwilitFloret: …Not right now. But thanks.*

*HarvestDancer: I’m only a message away.*

My mood lifted ever-so-slightly, I stowed the pad. *Well, now what? I have nothing to do… I could go to the gym early, but none of my herdmates will be there. I haven’t even been back since the match with Rika. And there’s no one at home either… Should I call Dad or Hiyla? No, no, Hiyla’s at school, and Dad’s having his interview this paw. If it doesn’t go well, we’ll be completely jobless…*

I began to anxiously twist my tail. *I-I don’t know for sure if Dad’s gonna be able to handle being around Humans… and I don’t know if anyone is going to hire me now! Stars, I… what am I supposed to do now…?*

The fear swirled inside me. Supporting three people on one wage was tough enough… even if I found something else, it probably wouldn’t pay as well. If Dad didn’t get the job, or if I couldn’t find something new, we’d be out of the house by the end of the pass!

I shook my head. *Okay. Okay. Calm down… I still have some time… I just have to find something else. Even if it’s cheap work, it’ll be better than nothing. And I’m not gonna do that just sitting here.*

With my mission decided, I stood, and finally put on my jacket and bag. “Okay…” I muttered to myself. “Time to go job-harvesting, I guess. Oh, stars, I haven’t updated my resume since I was hired at the park…! W-Well, I can do that at home later. For now, let’s just see if there’s any ‘help wanted’ signs anywhere.”

  

\++++++++++

  

“I’m sorry, but I can’t really afford any new employees right now,” the Venlil said, hefting a crate of fruit to display in front of the store. Setting it down, he brushed his thick wool out of his eyes. “You know how it is with the recession. But if you leave a resume, we could get back to you if something opens up.”

“I…” *Brahk, I should have just updated my resume first…* “I’ll just come back another time. Thanks.”

With an ear flick, the busy shopkeeper returned to his work, and I continued on my way. *Well, that’s another rejection…*

This was already getting tremendously discouraging. Less people were hiring than I thought… it’d gotten to the point that the lack of a “help wanted” sign was no longer a factor in whether or not I asked. I didn’t realize how lucky I’d really had it. Ever since the Venlil split from the Federation, we’d been deep in a recession. And we didn’t really have the wartime infrastructure of other species like the Gojid or Krakotl… we’d always trusted them to protect us.

Already, the dejection was draining me. Rejection after job rejection had planted weeds in my spirit. I felt completely exhausted and it was barely third sun.

*Maybe I should take a break…*

I looked around. I was near the market… maybe I could see if Pikro was around. I shouldn’t buy a mocha now that we had no income, but he was a great listener, and I really needed an ear. 

So I made the short trek into the market. It was crowded as usual… but I didn't mind. If anything, my mood was lifting just a bit. Pikro’s stall just had a nice atmosphere to it, and thinking about taking a break at his counter and chatting his ear off made my tail wag ever so slightly.

But as I finally broke through the crowd to see his stall, I only found it shuttered. Coffee Gojid was nowhere to be seen.

My ears fell. There was a sign hanging on the shutter itself, and I stepped closer to read it. It was written in rugged Gojid script, so I pulled out my pad and activated the visual translator.

It read “Gone on a trip with the missus. Be back in five paws!   –Pikro.”

I blankly stared at the sign for a moment. The misery returned full force, this time with a nice healthy dash of anger. “Brahking…!” I cursed to no one, before I pulled the hood of my jacket in front of my mouth and let loose a muffled scream into the fabric. The noise was drowned out by the hustle and bustle of the market.

Why was this paw stars-bent on being so awful? Was it something I did? Were the stars watching and passing their judgement? I’d been good, though! Tell them, Mom!

Letting the fabric fall, I let loose a groan of frustration. Now what? I guess I could find another place to rest, or keep looking for work… but honestly, the whole paw had been ruined completely beyond repair at this point. I just wanted to go home. My family should be getting back about now, anyways.

I shook my head again. I still had a little fuel in the reactor. I could look a little longer.

*Hey, uh, Little Flame? Now that we’re more cool with each other, could you maybe give me a boost?*

I waited a moment, but it didn’t respond. Figures. This sorta thing isn’t really *its* thing.

Still, I turned and got back to my search. Asking around the marketplace at each stall, which I realized quickly was probably a flowerbird’s plan. Most of the stalls were family operated, and weren’t hiring outsiders.

So I tried down the street, heading back in the direction of the park. There were a few restaurants around, and I asked in every single one. Maybe someone needed tables waited, or brahk, dishes washed. But at each place I tried, I was only met with further rejection.

Eventually, I’d had enough. I was miserable enough to no longer be able to hide it—my ears were in a constant state of drooping, and my tail was practically dragging along the ground.

*Guess I’ll just go home and deliver the bad news…*

So I turned… when something stopped me.

*…Hmm?*

I looked up. I hadn’t realized it, but I recognized the business in front of me.

*Eorna and Seagal’s.* *This is the bar where that whole thing happened… I met with Vyrlo’s herd, and I threw a Letian into their floor…*

I stared at the building. I couldn’t help but notice that the “Humans welcome” sign had been removed… but other than that, it looked the same. It was open, too. Since Venlil Prime didn’t have a day/night cycle, many bars were open on different suns.

*…Didn’t Vyrlo or somebody else say that they’d buy me a round on the house next time I went in?*

I couldn’t exactly say no to “free” right now… and if I was being honest, I could use the drink. So despite myself, I trudged towards the wooden door and quietly entered. The bell above the entrance jingled to announce my arrival.

The bar itself was moderately busy, with about half the tables and seats filled. Prey species of all types were enjoying the cozy, warm atmosphere with their herdmates, some in joy, and some in sympathy. It really was a nice place… Vyrlo and his herdmates had good taste.

“Hey, welcome!” came a voice. It was the Fissan at the bar, serving a drink to another customer. Was he Eorna, or Seagal? I didn’t remember. “Have a seat, I’ll be right with you…”

He stopped briefly, staring at me for a scratch before his eyes widened. “Oh, hey! It’s you! It’s, uh…”

“Lerai,” I finished for him.

“That’s it! I recognized the pelt!” He turned his head out towards the tables. “Hey! Seagal! That Venlil’s here!”

“What Venlil? We have a *ton* of Venlil, it’s Venlil Prime!” answered the Nevok, serving more drinks to patrons at one of the tables. But then his eyes fell on me. “Oh, *that* Venlil! With the flip!”

A Venlil at his table glanced at me curiously. “What are you two talking about? What flip?” she asked.

“Oh, you shoulda seen it! There was this Letian that got completely plastered, and then–”

“Hey, uh, sorry…” I interrupted. I didn’t really want them to make a big deal out of it. “I was just wondering if that drink offer is still available?”

The Fissan—Eorna, by process of elimination—let out a soft, nickering chuckle. “You look like you need it. Have a seat. Seagal, don’t torture the poor thing, yeah?”

“Alright, alright,” he replied, flicking an ear before turning back to me. “But seriously. We did appreciate it. It’s rare for things to get that rowdy around here, but I’m happy you were here when it did.”

“Has it happened more than once?” I asked, sliding into the seat.

“It’s a bar. The occasional drunk losing their prey inhibitions happens every once in a while, especially given how strong the local liquor is,” Eorna replied. “Speaking of strong liquor, what’ll you have?”

“Sweet stinger. Thanks.”

The Fissan flicked an ear the Venlil way, and pulled a bottle of middle-shelf rymek from its spot. “So what’s up? I’ll be honest, I wasn’t sure you’d actually come back here to claim this,” Eorna said with a sympathetic look, as he began mixing the cocktail.

I sighed, slumping forward on the bar counter. “I got fired…”

“Oh, no…”

“Yeah. Worst part was, I was basically punished for doing a good thing.” I buried my snout in my arms. “I’ve been job-searching for a claw and a half, and haven’t harvested a single thing.”

“Yeah, things are rough right now with the recession,” Eorna said in sympathy. “I know Tarva was right in the end to split from the Federation, but it’s still awful how much pressure it’s putting on the average person. Just hang in there, yeah?”

I let out a weak laugh. “Hey, you don’t happen to be hiring right now, do you?”

Rather than the polite rejection I’d been expecting, to my surprise, the Fissan looked me up and down. “...Well, maybe…”

“Wait, really?” This was the first time all paw I hadn’t been turned down, and I couldn’t help but feel a surge of hope. “Wh-What do you need done?” I brayed, pushing myself up on the counter excitedly. “I can wait tables, I can wash dishes, uh, I could serve drinks, I don’t have a liquor license but I could get one–”

“Whoa, whoa, slow down!” Eorna laughed. “It’s, well… it’s complicated.”

Those were the worst words I’d ever heard. “Complicated how?” I asked, dejectedly slumping back into the barstool.

“Well…” The Fissan placed my finished stinger in front of me. It looked delicious, and the sweet notes of the alcohol filled the air. “Am I safe to guess from the pelt that you’re around Humans often?”

“Uhh… Yeah, I am,” I replied. I took the glass in a paw and gently took a sip of the yellowish cocktail, letting the sour-sweetness envelop my taste buds. *Brahk, I needed this…*

“I see…” the Fissan muttered. “Then, is it true they can drink alcohol? Despite being predators?”

*Uh?* “Why are you asking? Didn’t you have a ‘Humans welcome’ sign up last time I was here?”

“To be fair, we weren’t sure any of the predators were actually going to take us up on that,” the Fissan admitted, picking up a dirty glass and beginning to clean it. “We just figured ‘well, the Humans are clearly here to stay now, and after the Krakotl bombed their planet and Nikonus turned out to have lied about a lot of things, why don’t we just say they’re welcome even if they probably can’t drink?’ We figured we’d look more progressive at the time.”

My ears pinned back slightly in disgust. “So you were just trying to pull people in without actually caring about the Humans?”

“It’s not that we didn’t care. When that Human came in, we agreed to honor the offer and serve them, remember?” the Fissan countered. “We just didn’t think the offer would ever *actually* be taken up, because of their biology as predators. Alcohol tolerance is typically reserved for prey, since it appears naturally in fermenting fruit.”

He let out a snort. “Shows what we get for not doing the market research… Seagal went through the data dump the paw after you showed up, and it claimed that they could eat plants just fine. Which meant they could have alcohol by extension. It’s weird…”

“So if you know Humans can drink, why is it gone now?” I asked.

“Because the one time a Human *did* show up, it turned into you scuffing our nice floor with a drunkard. That was the worst fight I’ve seen since we opened this place\*.\*”

I couldn’t help but look away. “Sorry…”

“No, don’t be. That came out a bit harsher than I meant. We really did appreciate the help, just…” He let out a snorting sigh through his nose. “Too much liability, you know.”

My ears drooped, and I let out a breath. I couldn’t help but feel bad for the Humans. “It wasn’t even their fault though…” I muttered.

“I know… it’s unfair. But it was still too much of a risk,” he replied, though he didn’t seem proud of it. “We should have prepared better… funny enough, now we sort of have the opposite problem. The original offer seems to have spread through the Human pack via word-of-mouth. We’ve had more show up at the door since, and they’re always disappointed when we turn them down…”

“I see…” I muttered, taking another sip of the drink. *I still wish they hadn’t taken the sign down, but I can see why they’d do it…* “Wait, so what does that have to do with you hiring someone?”

“Well, Seagal and I have been debating trying again,” he admitted. “We know it’s risky, but… it doesn’t seem like any other bars are willing to take the chance on the predators. A lot of bars serve as safe-spaces for prey to mingle without the Humans around, you see. But we figure that if we were the first to allow them, and became a similar space for Human-friendly prey to come with their predator herdmates, we’d be filling a gap in the market. We already know there’s a customer base, since they keep showing up.”

“That’s a great idea!” I brayed. “I’d love to come here with my own Humans. You should do it!”

“...Welllll…” The Fissan hesitated. “It’s just… despite everything, neither of us are actually all that comfortable around the predators. I mean… How do you handle a drunk predator? We have no idea. So we’ve been considering hiring someone who really understands them.”

“I mean…” I thought aloud. “...You already know how to handle a drunk predator. You saw me toss that Letian, right?”

“What are you talking about? Letians aren’t predators.”

“They *were.* They’re one of the cured species. They used to be omnivores like Humans.”

Eorna stopped his glass-cleaning. His ears flicked and his snout twitched as he considered my words. “...No, that’s different,” he eventually replied.

“How so?”

“Because they *were* predators. As in, no longer predators,” he explained. “I get what you’re saying, but… regardless of the horrible things the Federation have done, Letians don’t eat flesh. They don’t hunt. They don’t have those latent instincts like Humans do.”

Seagal joined the conversation as he passed by. “What we’re worried about specifically is that if a Human gets drunk, it’ll lower their inhibitions, and loosen their control on their instincts. And then, well… we just don’t want some poor Dossur getting turned into a snack to go with their drinks, know what I mean?”

“They don’t have hunting instincts.” I sipped my drink. “Besides, last I saw, that Letian tried to slice my friend open. Seems pretty violent to me. A Dossur would be at risk there too.”

“That’s… hmmm…” Eorna mumbled. It didn’t seem like he’d thought of that.

“See, I know that’s what the Humans *say* about their instincts, but I don’t know if I really believe it,” Seagal replied. “Like, let’s not kid ourselves, they’re *real predators,* yeah? They’re really good at suppressing their instincts to hunt and kill, but they gotta let ‘em loose at some point. ‘S probably why they mostly keep to themselves over in their own district.”

I grumbled, taking another sip of the strong drink. “Buddy, trust me, I’ve seen them at their worst.” My mind went back to the second time Vince found me being harassed in the alleyway. “It’s not an issue of control, they just don’t have them. You don’t have to worry about it.”

The Nevok, however, just flicked an ear dismissively. “I’m just sayin’...”

I just sighed. Why couldn't people just understand?

Eorna let out deep, soothing chuckle. “Hey Seagal. Why don’t we just ban all the ex-predator species while we’re at it? Gojid, Krakotl…”

“And miss out on those customers? Fat chance,” the Nevok replied dryly. “‘Sides, I do kinda get what she’s getting at. Not like we prey can’t play dirty sometimes.”

“Nonsense. Name one time.”

Seagal just looked at his friend, thoroughly unimpressed. “Well I could start with our species’ respective media all about corporate espionage, buuuuut… Remember that time you snuck into my family’s store in the middle of the night ten cycles back to–”

“Alright, alright, point taken,” the Fissan sighed. “Let’s not go airing out all my mistakes now.”

With the topic seemingly dropped, Eorna quickly began mixing up some more drink orders. “But even though we understand what you’re saying, Lerai, it all boils down to the fact that we don’t really want a repeat of what happened when you were here.”

“Hmmm…” I intoned. *I could hear the unspoken implication: that things would happen with Humans around. I could definitely see someone getting rough with a Human. And if the Human got rough back… regardless of what happened, they’d probably end up getting blamed.*

“But all that said… we do still want to give them a chance,” Eorna continued, as Seagal took the drinks and wandered off. “We’re just worried about the risk, so we first need to find a way to *minimize* that risk. So I guess we’re looking for a bouncer?”

“A bouncer?”

“You know, like the big Mazics and Takkans and whatnot at other bars that check IDs and throw out rowdy drunks,” he explained. “We’ve been considering hiring one for the occasional prey drunks anyhow, especially since the incident. But the issue is that Mazic or not, the prey who are willing to challenge a predator in a show of dominance are few and far between.”

“I see…” I muttered. With a slow sip, I finished the drink and placed the empty glass on the counter. “I could do that.”

Eorna, at my offer, simply let out a soft, nickering laugh, causing my ears to fall slightly. “Listen, I appreciate it, but… we’re looking more for someone like an ex-Exterminator. Someone who really understands predator behavior beyond just being herdmates with them. Do you have any experience in the force?”

“I… no,” I admitted. “But I know I can handle Humans! What, is it because I’m a Venlil?”

“No, no! You’re obviously plenty knowledgeable about Humans, and you can handle yourself, even if I don’t understand how. It’s just… we have to pick *really* carefully, if we do this at all. Because if there’s a slip-up, and someone gets hurt, or worse, eaten…” He shuddered, his snout scrunching up. “Forget business liability, *I* wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”

I must have looked *really* dejected at the opportunity slipping through my digits, because he gave me a look of sympathy. “Look, I can’t promise anything, but if you’ve got a resume…”

“No, it’s fine…” I mumbled.

“You sure? Even if you’re not an Exterminator, I figured you might have some military training, to do what you did…” Eorna questioned idly. “How *did* you do that crazy flip-throw-thing, anyway?”

“I, well…” I hesitated. I didn’t want to put anyone in danger until we were ready to go public. “I’d… rather not talk about it.”

“I see… well, I won’t push it,” Eorna replied, a hint of disappointment in his voice. He motioned to the empty glass. “Want another? You’ll have to pay for it, though.”

“No, I should probably be getting home,” I sighed, sliding from the seat. “Thanks, though.”

“Sure. If we do figure something out and reopen to Humans, then bring your predators, yeah? Assuming they’re not *really* rowdy drunks.”

“I will.”

With a simple tail-flick goodbye, I put my paws in my jacket pockets and made for the door. “Bye! Thanks for stopping in!” Seagal called after me. I repeated the tail-flick towards the Nevok in response.

I gently shut the wooden door behind me. My tail swayed idly—I was still feeling anxious about the future, but at least for now I did feel a little better.

*I hope those two do figure something out… I want to take my Human herdmates places.*

With a little breath of contentment and a hint of disappointment, I turned to start my walk home. Where should I look next paw? Well, I should actually get my resume updated first. Then maybe… I dunno, are the Humans still hiring? Maybe if Dad does get his job he could put in a word—

Lost in my own thoughts, I snoutplanted right into something fuzzy.

SW-200lbs CW-192lbs 46F Perimenopausal 

I am a newbie because I started seven weeks ago. I started with 14-10, but very soon, I increased it to 16:8. I usually do 18:6 on weekends.

I started working out regularly -3-5 times a week, strength training, and walks—three weeks ago. The first month, I didn't have any problem with hunger pangs. However, my hunger pangs have been killing me for the last two weeks. My appetite increases noticeably in the last 5-10 days of my menstrual cycle. This is not new. This has always been the case. 

So now, the combination of my new workout schedule and period food cravings is killing me. I try to include more protein and good carbs—the whole deal. :( But I am really struggling right now. I can't stop thinking about food all the time when I am fasting. 

I have tried black coffee and water, but they only help briefly. The thought of food is always there. Has anybody else felt this before? How do you deal with it?

Snow White: she would adapt very quickly. She’ll sing to the birds but they won’t sing back and she’ll be fine with it. She’s one of those girls that have a very can-do attitude. She’ll find a job right away and excel doing it because she’s one of those people that just wants to be helpful.

Cinderella: also adapts to the world around her. Her dreams might be a little smaller and easier to achieve. She blends in very well.

Aurora would be the tricky one. Because she immediately hides when she meets a stranger and I can’t imagine that going well if someone’s just like trying to be nice and help her. On the other hand, she adapts pretty quickly too.

Ariel wants to get into everything and talk to everyone and she’s very perky and maybe a little annoying to everyone around her. I don’t think she’s the one that knows boundaries quite yet. I love her, but she’s very eager to learn everything, including maybe taking apart a microwave. I think Rapunzel and Anna would follow in her footsteps. Both of them are just poking around at the world trying to figure out what is going on.

Belle: fine just like Cinderella and Snow White. She’s gonna be hanging around; maybe she’ll hang out at that café with her book and a hot chocolate (coffee was everywhere chocolate was a commodity just for the upper class).

Jasmine: judging from the time she took that apple and didn’t pay for it I think she’s gonna have a hard time at first before settling in quickly. She’d love luxury goods and like shop at Bloomingdale’s, she strikes me as having an expensive taste but in a classy way.

Mulan, Pocahontas, Raya, Elsa, and Merida observe and adapt. They like wearing jeans or pullover dresses. Merida is quite disappointed to learn that she doesn’t ride horses everywhere, she likes the big flatbed trucks though and hikes. Mulan becomes a board game junkie. 

Honestly, a majority of their hobbies (except Raya) still exist in today’s world and probably will continue to do them. Merida will find a stable and archery range. Mulan will find those old people that play checkers in the park and watch them for a little bit. Pocahontas likes extreme sports and a roller coaster junkie. Elsa likes school and learns engineering. Raya just rides a motorcycle around everywhere.

Tonight we’ll be looking at the AFC South. I have a feeling this one should be fun, so let’s jump right into the biggest one:

Houston Texans: *Force everyone that was born in the state of Texas to live within the stadium*

As complicated it would be, on so many different levels, to have every natural born Texan moved into a limited stadium, it could happen if everyone just chose to freeze in place and lay on the ground like sardines forever. Granted, that would make viewing the actual game much more difficult, but then profits could be made by selling tickets to the lucky few who get to sit in the stands and actually watch the players, who will also be laying down in sardine formation to conserve space. The o-line may not be the best, but they’ll find a way to get under their opponents.

Indianapolis Colts: *Horses everywhere, and multiple games of horseshoes around the stadium*

We’re going full western with this one. Horses around the field putting the janitors to work, on the field munching on that sweet sweet artificial turf, and even in the stands filling up unused seats (would that count as pumping crowd noise?). Just don’t ask the vendors what they use when they’re running low on meat. As for the horseshoes, it may not be the best form of entertainment, but as always, this is about accuracy, not practicality, and hey, maybe this can help them bond with their great-great-great grandparents over entertainment, so this is a family-friendly idea, of course (we are not bringing in Megan Thee Stallion to fit with this).

Jacksonville Jaguars: *Just like the Colts, but put jaguars everywhere, and cover the stadium in plants and vines*

We’re going with some full predatory themes here, and I mean animals, you sickos. Granted, there’s still plenty of safety hazards with jaguars and potentially 5 year old kids in the same room, but as long as we don’t have the next Harambe, and as long as no one is injured, everyone will be a-okay, hopefully. Bonus points if the vines are painted blonde to match Trevor’s hair.

Tennessee Titans: *Bring God down to the stadium and force Him to live there*

Would this be controversial? Sure. Could it count as sacrilege putting a deity in the same building as a man who puts dollops of mayonnaise into his coffee before drinking? Absolutely. But imagine the scene of literal God sitting with the fans watching the Tennessee Titans of all teams play football on a regular Sunday. That could boost some ratings.

**PROLOGUE:**

  
our story begins when audrey, (now with control over the cycle) went to get some coffee from downstairs. But when she returned, she realised the book controlling the cycle disappeared! She realised someone stole it, and took it for themself. in the cycle, we pan to a lost one named Michelle. Michelle is in Charge of searching for supplies to keep the lost ones safe & healthy, but when she exits, she notices a stairwell she didn’t notice before. She goes through it and ends up on another floor of the studio: Level M. She searches for any life, but comes across a GENT Pipe. This seems to have been upgraded by someone… and she then is ambushed by the butcher gang. they knock her out, but before She blacks out, a mysterious figure takes out all the butcher gang.

She then meets a searcher-lost one-mix whose name is Allen. allen agrees to help Michelle find out the secrets of the lost Levels. Allen gives Michelle a key and she leaves. Michelle comes across a door, and it could only be opened by a switch in a nearby storage room. The storage room is gated of though, and Allen seeps under the gate. She then flicks the lever and leaves Michelle to fight for herself. After entering the door, we see a small figure scurrying away. Michelle corners the figure, and it’s revealed to be a small fellow named “Benny.” Benny is small, scared, and has a mechanical arm that can access executive-access doors. they both briefly encounter a version of The Ink Demon. This is a minion of the much more big And powerful Ink Demon. Michelle and Benny both get in a little miracle station, and the demon leaves them alone. They both press on and enter a small storage room. After getting swarmed by searchers, they continue into a large storage warehouse. here, Michelle finds a GENT Pipe upgrade. a syringe for getting rid of searchers easier. They come across a flooded staircase that they need to drain. they find a valve and they insert it into a pipe. Then the stairwell drains. They eventually make it to Level 8. They both see another Ink Demon Minion, this time being battled by a lost one. This time wearing suspenders and welding a wrench, and an axe. the Ink Demon Minion runs from her and disappeared into a wall. It is revealed her name is Carla, and she trusts Michelle because she took care of Benny for her. They both wander into a safehouse of sorts where there is a bunch of friendly lost ones and a pile of bacon soup cans. Carla explains how the Ink Demons Michelle has met were mere clones of a much larger, more powerful ink demon. Located in a large cavern containing a gigantic “REEL INK MACHINE.” and the only way to defeat the REEL Ink Demon, he Has to first be vulnerable. And you do this by turning off the REEL INK MACHINE. 

**”CHAPTER 2: OLD FAMILY RECIPE”**

They all exit the safehouse, and get attacked by more searchers, but this time, Michelle has an upgraded GENT Pipe. She easily takes them out. They find a large room With giant vats of Bacon Soup. AKA: The Bacon Soup Production Plant. After turning on the Bacon Soup Machines, the next room is unlocked, but an Ink Demon Minion lurks nearby.

The gang wander around and enter a room where there’s another section of the Bacon Soup Production plant. This time, there are winding corridors and offices, and there are lost ones wandering all around. after The gang navigates the offices they end up at a large bendy statue in front of a giant vat of bacon soup. the door that sammy went through required a key. And that key was somewhere in the area… behind the bendy statue, there were offices where people were employed, and where bacon soup designs were made. But now these halls lurk with Lost ones with machines for their heads… they all welded different weapons and all were roaming the halls of the offices. after the gang followed arrows drawn on walls, they found the keys. After they unlocked the room Sammy entered, Sammy ambushed them, resulting in a boss fight. after the gang defeated Sammy, they got to a part where three levers must be flicked at the same time. After the gang does so, there are bashing and clanging sounds coming from Benny‘s location. Carla runs to investigate and a door shuts behind Michelle. Leaving Michelle alone. She finds a long corridor with a door at the end of it. She walks up to it and enters the room. It’s a control room with a pedestal in the center. There’s a big window and two doors left and right. Suddenly, the wall where the window is is broken open, revealing a giant ink demon standing in-front. The REEL INK DEMON. Michelle must navigate through caves all around the large cavern while trying to find three objects and place them in three control rooms. She does so and pulls a switch in a main control room. after that, it turns off the REEL INK MACHINE. this opens a door to her right. behind it is a stairwell, and at the bottom is a tram. She enters the tram and it goes through a door. a door closes behind the tram and another one opens in-front. the tram goes through a long, inky pipe.

She come out as a cartoonish-human. more of a silhouette, but human. She was made of ink But wasn’t dripping everywhere? She found some suspenders to cover herself. And found out shortly that she had the power to traverse through ink. She entered another train station and it led to an area where she found a dock where she found a boat. She climbed Up a ladder and was met with another control room. She met up with Carla and Benny. Carla commented on Michelle’s human appearance and brushed it off. the Ink demon was still a threat though. So they had to act quickly. carla went to a control panel and operated a giant crane and helped Michelle to defeat the ink demon. Michelle found A drill and used it to attack the giant ink demon. When Carla hit the demon and had it knocked over, michelle travelled To the ink demon through the ink and hacked the demon to pieces. and when it was weak enough, Michelle dove Into the demon through a hole on his back. Michelle traversed tunnels inside of the ink demon and found a film reel in his chest labelled “The End.” Michelle took this item and escaped the demon. When she got out, she went to the crane control room and a Door has opened. She walks through and finds a pipe in the ground. Michelle Jumped into the pipe, and ended up in a room with a projector in the centre. She placed the “THE END” Reel on it, but was ambushed by a group of searchers, lost ones, GENT Minions, and butcher gang members. but then, the gang came back together and fought them all off. Everyone was there, including Allen! After a battle, Michelle placed the film reel on the projector, and turned it on…

**CB Wes Morgan** \- since I don't have any Jamaicans (I wonder if anyone plays any cards at all?) I decided to take an Englishman who always adds charm and always has something going on around him - ***Harry Maguire***. No need for introduction.

**CB Robert Huth** \- I don't have a decent white German in this position, but since I swapped Wes in terms of color, I'll do it now and there's ***Tah***.

Here's some things about us:

- We've been together for 2 and a half years.  
- She's not a gamer. I'm one since I was a kid.  
- I never forced her to play games. I asked her once to watch me play Final Fantasy Rebirth on launch (only that day), but that was it.  
- She works from 8am to 4pm. I work from 1pm to 5:30pm.  
- She played through It takes two from start to end with me. She had problems at first, and she asked me if I could skip some sections for her. I gave her clues, but she managed to complete the game without me touching her controller once. I feel that's important, because if I skipped, I'd lack trust for her, and she'd have more trouble later in the game, which didn't happen.  
- We started two other games, A way out and Unravel 2. We've only played each of them once, and I'm not in a hurry to finish those games.  

I feel like that's enough info. Since December 12th, when Split Fiction was announced, I told her I wanted to play this game with her. For me, this game will be the best experience in the year. I just love everything that Josef Fares does with gaming. We watched trailers, I shared my excitement with her.

And then, on release day, I picked her from work, made her coffee (which she likes in the afternoon), gave her time to take a shower. Although I was super excited, I didn't want to rush her. After all this, we started to play. She was playing with an angry face, and ONE hour later she says ""When are we stopping?"". We barely started, but I did turn the game off. 

We've played 10 times already since release on March 6th, but she keeps asking when are we shopping, sometimes she gets stressed and she starts to play badly saying she lost focus, and she uses cutscenes to grab her phone. She can't even recall that much of the game's story.

I feel it's not enough. I give my life for this woman. I put her even before my needs. And always smiling. Never complained about having to do something for her. I was happy because of being with her. But she says I should be grateful and that I do not understand. I know she might be tired, but I feel like at least on the release day, she could've put a little more effort, played a little more, would be more willing to engage with me and the story, but the feeling I get from her is that a burden.

That's it, am I expecting too much of her? We say we are each other's best friends, and I know she works more than me, but it feels like an excuse when I hear it every time we play.",1,1742524511.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Maybe more. I’ve been listening to some of Neville’s lectures but as I’m pretty busy recently I haven’t got far. And some tips here on this sub have been pretty helpful.

Anyways… I kinda had a realization this week. A realization that me and my family have kinda been manifesting my whole life. We’re in a good spot now, but early on we had a pretty cruddy life, but for simplicity I’ll leave it at that unless it’s relevant.

When we’d find ourselves in a less than optimal situation, like when we all got the flu and our power/water was out, or longer term situations, we’d always say “It will get better. Things will work out like they always do.” And… they always do. A lot of times it happens in the most unexpected or magic-feeling ways. Like when I was in high school and we were looking for a house because our current house was becoming unsafe, I told my bus driver “I may not be here much longer. We’re looking for a new place to rent.” And… she told me her family was renting out a house in the next town over. After giving her my mom’s number to send info, we got into the house within the month, and even at a discounted rent because we were recommended by a family member.

So now I’m thinking… how can I apply this to “consciously manifesting?” As in… I always said things like “things will work out how they’re supposed to” because it was a phrase ingrained in me since I was young, it’s easy to set and forget, but when I’m trying to manifest, even something small like a coffee, I can’t really “assume.” I can tell myself with the utmost confidence “I’m getting a coffee today” but it just… doesn’t. Has anybody had similar experience (realizing you’ve manifested all your life and applying it now) and if so, what advice might you have? I know in the end everyone has their own way of working the law, and I think given some work with this realization I could come to that same point.

Basically the title but obviously some more context 
So I (25F) and (24F) reconnected at the end of 2024 through Instagram. We went to high school together weren’t close but close enough that I can consider her as a friend , we did hang out ALOT during the summer of our senior year, and got her a job at where I worked since. but we just kinda drifted apart. I guess since we went to different colleges and really didn’t have that much things in common so it was a given that we weren’t gonna be speaking to each other a lot. No hard feelings, just life be lifing. Went to college Covid hit and she deleted her social media or more like she blocked everyone from high school, including myself I didn’t know what happened from other high school friends it was because of her political stand, I personally didn’t care much of it and did my own thing

Now she’s married with a much older man ( none of my business) she added me on Instagram again we started sending some memes and just chatting in general about life and she wanted to talk to me in person. So we scheduled a date in December and I thought it went well. I got her a small Christmas gift as well. It was mostly about her venting that she has no friends and that her only friend is her husband and and told me the reason why she blocked everyone was because someone from her friend group was joining insults to her husband because hes police officer, which made her not want to associate herself with anybody, come on with other friendship drama in the group that she was in. she’s currently pregnant and it made her rethink about friends and wanted to get close to me again because of common believes and that she liked my company. we talked for hours in the coffee shop until it was time for her to be picked up by her husband. We still chat, send some song recommendations. Nothing too crazy but we still keep in touch. Probably like every other day. along with sending memes. 

In January, she sent me a baby registry which is fine. I told her I’ll take a look and see what I can (was unemployed at that time and she was aware) 
Now a few weeks back, she just had her baby shower… I wasn’t invited. It looked like a big baby shower with venue. I’m not gonna lie. I was a bit hurt and confused but mostly confused because she sent me her registry but not an invite. I saw her posting in her story about the baby shower so I sent her a message and curtain congratulated her and told her to have fun. Maybe I should tell her I was a little hurt that I wasn’t invited or WIBTAH if I stop talking to her? I don’t want to feel like I was just her therapist and she’s good to go now.",3,1742524103.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

**First question.**

We have these ""default"" he/his, she/her:

He has a drink. This is his coffee.

She has a drink. This is her coffee.

Now, let's take ""she/they"" and ""they/them"" that I often see:

She has a drink. This is they coffee..?

They have a drink. This is them coffee..?

Is this how it's supposed to work? Okay, you'll say these are the options and it implies that I can choose any. Let's get back to where we started then:

He has a drink. / His has a drink..?

She has a drink. / Her has a drink..?

It clearly isn't.

In a word, what is going on?

**Second question.**

What's the point in writing two words for everyone? Would be logical to use two words only for people who needs it.

**Third question.**

If these are options, why are there objective forms? All the forms must be subjective in this case. Otherwise it's inconsistent.

If these are different genders for different forms, why are there non-objective forms for the second one? All the second forms must be objective in this case. Also, why are there always only two forms? What about possessive, reflexive forms?",0,1742524058.0,asktransgender,12,0.09,False

Same thing with Door Dash, ordering food twice a week adds up. Both are very tempting when you’re tired or not in the mood to cook or to make your own coffee.

I deleted both apps at the beginning of the year. I didn’t delete either account; in case I needed to redownload them (for whatever reason). I have caved a couple times. I had the excuse of “oh I’m running late to work, let just order a coffee quick to pick up” or “I’m not in the mood to cook.” But I’ve kept them deleted for a long time since those hick-ups.

Today, I’ve made the executive decision to delete both accounts. I realized that if I’m not willing to sit in the drive-thru or stand in line to wait for coffee/food (or anything at this point), I don’t deserve to enjoy these splurges. This seems obvious but self-control can be a tricky thing.

**Theme:**

The theme that we're inspired by is Organic Modern - not married to this but it is quite compelling. Minimalistic and Japandi are quite nice too. 

Hoping to feel safe, welcome, cozy and warm. 

I've added a GIF of the walkthrough, a 2D rendering of the space (as close to measurement as possible), and more pictures. 

**What we currently will bring with us on our move:** 

1. We have 2 standing desks. The left table top is oak with grey legs and the right table top will be black with black legs. We prefer to keep these as we work remotely.
2. We have a 55"" TV, and a white ikea [AURDAL ](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/aurdal-wardrobe-combination-white-s09331524/)that has only drawers, with no rods protruding from it.
3. There is overhead lighting and we hope to switch the bulb so we have more control of the lighting, but also are intrigued by floor lamps, or any additional lighting we can bring in.

  
**Constriants:** 

1. The walls are white.
2. The floors are light brown wood 
3. There's overhead lighting in each room, but we will probably want additional lighting 

**Thoughts so far:** 

So far what I've looked at is Lovesac for couches - a sectional chaise, since we don't have an incredible amount of space we were considering a 2 seat with chaise, with each section (3 total) having storage underneath).

  
We also are conflicted between a coffee table and a small dining table - sitting on the floor to eat dinner is a deal breaker, but a lift top coffee table might be sufficient.

1jg6gzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jg6gzl/fn_the_static_bloom/,[FN] The Static Bloom,"The rain tasted like rust in New Veridia. It always did this time of year, clinging to the neon signs and slicking the grimy alleyways I called home base. My name’s Flicker – or at least, that's what they call me. Real name? Doesn’t matter. I specialize in minor inconveniences: rerouting power grids to dim streetlights during rush hour, subtly altering traffic signals for maximum chaos, occasionally swapping out the sugar in the mayor’s coffee with salt. Harmless stuff. Annoying, sure, but harmless. The local supers – the Bright Guard – tolerated me like a persistent mosquito. A nuisance, easily swatted away when they bothered.

I considered myself an artist of disruption. A maestro of mild mayhem. It was all a game, you see. A way to feel… something in this city that felt increasingly grey.

Then came Obsidian. He arrived without fanfare, just a ripple in the usual hum of New Veridia’s energy field. They said he was from the Outer Rim Territories – a place where heroes were legends and villains ruled with an iron fist. I dismissed it as hyperbole until I saw him. A towering figure wreathed in shadows, his eyes burning like cold embers.

The Bright Guard tried to stop him. Foolish, brave idiots. They charged in, all shining armor and righteous fury. Obsidian… he played with them. Twisted their powers back on themselves, shattered their defenses with a casual flick of his wrist. And then... the screams started. Real, gut-wrenching screams that echoed through the city’s underbelly.

I watched from the shadows, huddled in my usual perch above a noodle shop, feeling a cold dread creep into my bones. Obsidian didn't just defeat them; he *destroyed* them. Publicly. Brutally. It was… theatrical. And terrifying.

He moved through New Veridia like a plague, systematically dismantling everything the Bright Guard represented. The city held its breath. Even I, Flicker, the self-proclaimed maestro of mild mayhem, felt powerless.

Then, he came looking for me. Not to fight, not yet. Just… to observe. He found me in my alleyway, surrounded by flickering neon signs and discarded tech scraps.

“You’re Flicker,” he said, his voice a low rumble that vibrated through the pavement. “The little spark.”

I tried to play it cool, leaning against a wall with an air of nonchalant defiance. ""And you're Obsidian. Heard stories.""

He chuckled, a sound devoid of humor. “Stories are often embellished. You, however… you’re more interesting than I anticipated.” He gestured towards the city skyline. ""You manipulate energy fields, don't you? Subtly. Like a whisper in the wind.""

I swallowed hard. My power wasn’t flashy. It was subtle – an ability to subtly influence electromagnetic fields. Enough to dim lights, reroute signals, cause minor electrical glitches. I always thought it was… insignificant. A parlor trick.

“What are you getting at?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

""You have a resonance,"" he continued, ignoring my question. ""A latent potential. You're suppressing it."" He paused, his eyes boring into mine. “Why?”

Suddenly, the alleyway felt smaller, the rain colder. A strange pressure built within me, a tingling sensation that started in my fingertips and spread through my entire body. I clenched my fists, trying to contain it.

“I… I don’t know what you're talking about,” I stammered.

Obsidian smiled, a cruel, predatory curve of his lips. ""Don't lie to me, little spark. Your fear is radiating outwards."" He raised a hand, and the neon signs around us began to pulse erratically, their colors shifting into an unsettling kaleidoscope. The air crackled with energy. “Let it out.”

I fought against it, but the pressure was overwhelming. It felt like my skin was about to split. Then, something snapped. A surge of raw power erupted from me, not subtle manipulations anymore, but a blinding wave of electromagnetic force that sent debris flying and short-circuited every electronic device within a hundred yards.

The rain stopped abruptly. The neon signs exploded in showers of sparks. And I stood there, trembling, bathed in an eerie blue light, feeling… different. Powerful. Terrified.

Obsidian’s smile widened. ""Impressive,"" he said softly. “You were hiding quite the bloom.” He turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows. “I'll be needing your assistance, Flicker. New Veridia needs a conductor.""

The city was silent now, save for the crackling of dying electronics. I looked down at my hands, still trembling with residual energy. The little spark had ignited. And I knew, with a chilling certainty, that my games were over. My harmless annoyances were a distant memory. Now, I was something else entirely. Something… dangerous.",1,1742523842.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

Whether you're a homeowner replacing your filter for the first time or a property manager looking for bulk discounts, we've got you covered.

## Why a KitchenAid Water Filter Matters

Before we dive into comparisons and reviews, let's quickly recap *why* a KitchenAid water filter is so crucial. These small but mighty devices play a crucial role in ensuring the water and ice from your KitchenAid refrigerator are clean, fresh, and safe for consumption.

   **Improved Water Quality:** A genuine KitchenAid water filter is designed to reduce contaminants like lead, chlorine, pesticides, and other impurities that can affect the taste and odor of your water.
   **Healthier Drinking Water:** By filtering out harmful substances, your KitchenAid water filter helps protect you and your family from potential health risks associated with contaminated water.
*   **Prolonged Refrigerator Life:** Cleaner water flowing through your refrigerator's internal components helps prevent mineral buildup and corrosion, which can extend the lifespan of your appliance.*   **Better Tasting Beverages:** Filtered water translates to better tasting coffee, tea, and other beverages.
   **Crystal Clear Ice:** A quality KitchenAid fridge water filter ensures your ice cubes are clear, solid, and free from any unpleasant tastes or odors.

## Understanding Your KitchenAid Water Filter Needs

Choosing the right KitchenAid water filter starts with understanding your specific needs and the type of filter your refrigerator requires. there are several factors to consider:

   **Refrigerator Model:** The most crucial step is to identify your KitchenAid refrigerator model number. This information is typically found on a sticker inside the refrigerator compartment. Knowing your model number will allow you to pinpoint the correct KitchenAid water filter model compatible with your appliance. Many online retailers and appliance part stores have compatibility checkers to simplify this process.
   **Filter Model Number:** Once you know your refrigerator model, you can determine the corresponding kitchenaid water filter model number. Common models include KitchenAid water filter 4 (KAD4RXD1) and KitchenAid water filter 2 (KAD2RXD1).Check your refrigerator's user manual or the existing filter for the correct model number.
   **Water Quality Concerns:** Consider the quality of your local water supply. If your water is known to have high levels of certain contaminants, you may want to choose a filter that is specifically certified to reduce those substances. Look for certifications from NSF International, which indicate that the filter has been tested and proven to meet specific performance standards.
   **Replacement Frequency:** KitchenAid recommends replacing your water filter every six months (or 200 gallons, whichever comes first). Regularly replacing your filter ensures optimal water quality and prevents the filter from becoming clogged and ineffective. consider setting a reminder on your phone or subscribing to a kitchenaid water filter subscription service to ensure you never forget to replace your filter.
   **Budget:** KitchenAid water filter prices can vary depending on the model and were you purchase it. While it's tempting to opt for the cheapest option,prioritize quality and certification to ensure you're getting a filter that effectively removes contaminants. Look for discount KitchenAid water filters from reputable retailers or take advantage of KitchenAid water filter sale events.

   **Bad Tasting water:** If the water tastes bad even after replacing the filter, there may be other issues with your water supply. Consider having your water tested by a professional. Some users may use a KitchenAid Refrigerator filter substitute to fix this issue.

1jg6by3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1jg6by3/heres_how_we_managed_to_spend_312_less_in_the/,Here’s how we managed to spend 31.2% less in the last 6 months—without sacrificing our quality of life.,"My fiancé and I are trying to start a business. Unfortunately, borrowing money from a bank isn’t an option for us, and we don’t have anyone to ask for financial help. That means every dollar counts.

Saving enough for a business is a massive challenge no matter where you live, so we decided to get serious about our spending. That meant cutting back, being more intentional with our habits, and making smarter financial choices—including how we power our home.

Here’s exactly how we reduced our expenses by 31.2% in the last six months:

1. Setting a Monthly Spending Limit

If we hit our limit, we don’t spend another dime. Simple as that. Hungry? We get creative with what’s in the fridge. It sounds extreme, but it works. We set a reasonable cap that still covers essentials, and we’ve never actually had to push it to the breaking point.

2. Cutting Out Unnecessary Subscriptions

Everything from streaming services to random app subscriptions—gone. Instead, we use free entertainment options, and honestly, we don’t miss a thing. This alone saved us over $100/month. It’s crazy how much money was going toward things we barely used.

3. No More Takeout or Eating Out

We still eat well—probably better than before—but we cook everything ourselves. We prioritize fresh, local ingredients and have actually started to enjoy the process of meal prepping together. Before, we were spending $320/month on restaurant food. By cutting that out, we’re saving $210/month while eating healthier.

4. Reducing Transportation Costs

If a destination is within a reasonable distance, we walk or bike instead of driving. We still use our car when necessary, but this small change has saved us $80/month on gas and maintenance.

5. No New Clothes or Shoes (Unless Absolutely Necessary)

We realized we already had everything we needed, so we made a rule: no buying new clothes unless we have no replacements at home. In the past six months, we’ve spent just $72 total on clothing.

6. Making Coffee at Home

We used to spend $120/month on coffee from cafés. Now, we use our own espresso machine and take our coffee to go in reusable cups. Not only does this save money, but we also get to make exactly what we want every morning.

7. Optimizing Our Home Energy Use

This was a game-changer. We’ve always been mindful of our electricity bill, but after discovering monalee.co, we realized how much we were overpaying. Their AI-powered platform helped us figure out how to transition to solar in a way that actually made sense financially—without the pushy sales tactics or unnecessary fees. By cutting our dependence on the grid, we’re seeing real long-term savings, which is huge when every dollar matters.

8. Cooking for Our Dog Instead of Buying Expensive Food

We used to spend $230/month on high-quality dog food and treats. Now, we cook balanced meals with real meat and some grains, and our dog loves it. This saves us $112/month while giving our pup healthier food.

Of course, cutting back alone won’t build a business. We’re using the extra savings to invest in growth—funding the tools, marketing, and resources we need. If all goes well, this will help us scale faster and succeed!

It took me a while to find him and he has good reviews, and he seemed concerned about my endometriosis symptoms unlike other Drs ive met with.
I had kind of an uncomfortable experience though. 

He wanted to do an exam, which in my 23 years of living I've never actually had an OBGYN do. No doctor has ever looked down there, not even for a pap smear. 
Well he looked and confirmed what I already kind of figured: my hymen is still fully in tact. Which is already kind of embarrassing as a 23 year old. 

But he also kind of grilled me with questions? He asked if there was a religious reason I had never had sex, if I was celibate. I said no, I just... havent found anyone I wanted to have sex with yet. I WFH so he started asking about my social life, seemingly worried I was some sort of recluse. But like I have a couple good friend groups and friends in multiple states, I travel frequently to visit and go out with them all. I just got back from a business trip to Canada and I literally got someones number when I went for coffee one day because I do in fact have game.
I online date too. Its not for a lack of trying im just.... not sure how to get past the talking stage with people. Im a lesbian and I live in the south, and its really really hard to meet other women organically irl and even harder to figure out when the right time to make a move is when online dating.

Im ngl ive also been kind of ashamed/embarrassed to try having sex *because* of my hymen. Ive tried breaking it myself over the years, but even when I first started my period in middle school I was never able to try a tampon because of the pain. And when your body is telling you to stop, its very hard to push through :/ I kinda just gave up after a while.

The doc said they could open my hymen up while im under for the laparoscopy, and I think I want them to do that because it will make things so much easier for me in the near future. The Dr warned me if i tried to have sex now, the pain and bleeding would likely be very distressing. I think not having to go through that, and the embarrassment id feel from it, would be nice. This might give me more confidence.

But for now I feel kind of humiliated and sad. I understand he was likely just like, worried. I mean 23 yr old woman, obviously very anxious, never even had a vaginal exam before, works from home, hymen fully in tact. It tells a tale of a woman who gets no bitches and probably has no friends. I get it. But I still feel a lil ashamed :/ 

Also when he had me lay down, he grabbed me and pulled me forwards really roughly and adjusted me himself which really spooked me. I wish he wouldve just told me to scooch down? I understand he likely thought I was really timid or something but a little warning at least would be nice. It was already an embarrassing scenario for me, since id never had an exam and was obviously a little jumpy and y'know, in tact hymen and all. 

Anyways its over now but I keep thinking back to it. Im glad he did the exam and gave me a solution, because my regular OBGYN has brushed me off at every turn so far. Ive been grappling with this forever and assumed id just. stay like that until I died, and that id never have sex and jusy stay single. So even though this was embarrassing I feel a little more hopeful.

I dont really know why im posting this. It feels too personal to talk to anyone about irl, and i feel like i just need to vent about it I guess. Or maybe im hoping for reassurance? I dont know. Its been a really distressing past few months lol. ",6,1742522542.0,WomensHealth,4,1.0,False
1jg61e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1jg61e9/honeycomb/,Honeycomb,"Honeycomb was watching TV in her room when she heard a loud clang in the kitchen. She ran over to see her daughter, Nectar crying because she was sneaking a jar of cookies on the pantry. And it fell on her head, causing her to fall. However, instead of comforting her, she took her phone out and recorded her. Throughout the recording she would repeatedly tell her ""What did you do?"" before capping it all up with ""Clean this mess up or i'm sending yoh to your room!"" Nectar was obviously sent to her room because she was too upset to care. When Honeycomb returned to her couch, she was watching the viral video show. She learned she could earn 50,000 dollars and a cruise trip if her video won, so she sent it via. Email. 

Weeks later, the host would invite her over to the show. And in the end, she would end up winning the Grand prize. Nectar, however, was not happy about this because she was not aware that her mother sent the video about her. No matter how much the host tried to comfort her, she would keep crying and crying. Suddenly, she started throwing a tantrum, and the program was cut short because of it. Honeycomb dragged her daughter out of the studio and started yelling at her. Telling her how wrong she was for making a scene in front of the whole audience, and how everyone watching saw as well. ""You know, maybe if you didn't touch the cookie jar like I told you to, we wouldn't even be in this mess! What do you think of that, young lady?"". Of course, she continued crying. But before she could take her home, she bumped into a crew member. She stood in front of Honeycomb, with her arms crossed. It turns out she was getting coffee when she overheard the conversation. ""You know what? Take your damn prize money! This little girl deserves a better mother than you!"" Honeycomb watched as the crew member took Nectar away from her. 

Of course, Honeycomb took the money and went to the cruise trip all by herself. But as she was boarding the ship, she started to look back on when her husband, Magnum left her. When Honeycomb was pregnant, Magnum decided he didn't want to take responsibility for Nectar, so he left. It crushed Honeycomb, because all she wanted was for Nectar to have  a father. It was here, Honeycomb would then realize she had become no better than Magnum. Honeycomb decided to get off the ship. Unfortunately it was too late. As the door closed and the horn whistled, she would spend the next month haunted by the luxury she so desperately wanted all this time. ",0,1742522492.0,bluey,6,0.2,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

* **Outdoor-wise,** we've hit up **Jackson Wellsprings, Lithia Park Trail, and the Japanese Garden.** Any other cool outdoor spots we've missed?

* **Any local events or performances happening in late April?** (Live music, drag shows, queer shift, etc.)
* **Any late-night spots good for a big group?** 
* **Any must see spots in the afternoon when we break up into smaller groups?** (Coffee shops, bookstores, art galleries, etc.)

So, two questions:

1. Does anyone else have memories of orange coffee ice cream? I swear, Google has nothing on it. I imagine that with the number of Orange Creamsicle coffee recipes out there it would be a thing, but I can't find anything specifically about an ice cream this flavor.

2. If you HAVE heard of it, any chance you've run across a recipe that might do this combination justice? I can certainly start experimenting on my own, but it would be great to have a solid starting point.

\-------

Lysa sauntered across her kitchen to the front door. While en route to opening and welcoming in her guests, she, of course, planted a gentle drive-by kiss on her Ruh’ah’s cheek. She also playfully gave his pert rump a squeeze, a gesture he was lightning quick to turn about and return. 

“Now, dear, we have guests,” Lysa winked.

“Oh, I did not think Lira and Fienel would be insulted by it,” Martinez replied. 

“I’m not,” Perla quipped from the nearby table. She leaned back and downed an entire beer without even taking a moment to breathe. 

Martinez shook his head, shocked by the amount of sauce that Perla had already put away. Before her gravitic figure, Perla had neatly arranged a dozen bottles of beer, each emptied within the last hour. The only reason Martinez found it surprising was that Perla seemed barely buzzed. She showed no signs that she had drunk any alcohol other than her usual jibbing, and jokes grew from one with point and sass to almost random and nonsensical. 

“I figured you would not be,” Martinez replied, sliding the grilled cheese sandwich he had made out of the pan and onto a plate. 

Martinez walked over to the table and joined Perla just as Lysa opened the door and greeted Finiel and Lira. As the sounds of their greeting flowed around the corner, he pushed the sandwich across the table toward Perla. 

That succulent morsel of cheese, bread, garlic, and butter did not even last a second within the reach of the Varintol woman. One second, it was there; the next, it was already traveling down her gullet. 

“If you keep cooking like that, I will have to steal you for myself,” Perla burped before pointing a clawed finger at Martinez and winking. “Oros would love to have someone like you in her court.” 

“I doubt Lysa would appreciate that,” Martinez replied, “She probably would hunt you down.”

“Meh, I can take her,” Perla shrugged. “When is dinner, by the way? The roast smells amazing,”

Martinez rolled his eyes and looked over his shoulder at the timer on the oven. “It’s got about an hour left.” 

“That's good because I'm ready to eat,” Perla smiled, cracking open another beer she had fished out of the case beside her. 

“You just ate a fourth sandwich and all the jerky out of the pantry,” Martinez reminded. 

“And? I am a lot of woman who needs a lot of food,” Perla chuckled, ravenously running her hand over her plump stomach and broad hips. 

Martinez sighed and took one of the beers, deciding to not argue the point. 

He was already paying to feed Lysa as much food as a small army; now, with Perla here, he had blown an entire month's pay on dinner alone. Go figure, twenty kilograms of Hartox, and all the fixing to make a pot roast fit to feed ten people was not cheap. 

There were only going to be six people coming over to Lysa’s house today, but planning around Perla and Lysa’s appetites was absolutely necessary. Martinez did not know what a buzzed Perla would be like, but he would prefer not to add her hunger to that likely volatile equation.  

There was no particular reason to have everyone over today; Lysa simply wanted her friends to come. So, while Martinez had moved many of his things into her house today, Lysa extended the invitations to most of their mutual friends. 

“Martinez,” Feinel said, walking into the room following Lysa. 

Looking at the lupine man, Martinez raised a brow. He had expected Lira to arrive as well, but he had not seen their state coming. 

Lira, the proud white wolfen alien, was hanging off his arm, giving him goo-goo eyes, while Lysa grinned like a mischievous fox at the duo. 

“What’s up, brother,” Martinez replied, standing up and fist-bumping Fienel. 

“Not too much. Work has been hell lately,” Fienel replied somewhat nonchalantly. 

“Still dealing with the Visage issue?” Martinez asked. 

“Yeah, that and I have to train another rookie,” Fienel explained as Lira slipped out of his arm and walked over to hug Perla. 

“Man, that blows,” Martinez said, handing a beer over to him. “Any funny fuck ups by them?” 

“A few. Come on, I will tell yah,” Fienel said, walking past Martinez and heading toward the bean bag chairs. 

Martinez looked at Lysa, silently asking if she wanted him there with the girls for anything. She smiled, shook her head, and picked up her non-alcoholic cider. 

Lysa knew well that over the last few weeks, Martinez had been outnumbered by women in his life to a degree most men would be driven to the brink of madness. 

He had been their dutiful companion, shopping, planning for the baby's arrival in less than two months, and, of course, attending every checkup with Lysa, which had been administered by an all-female staff. 

Now, Martinez did not hate doing all of those things; he considered them part of the preparations for what was to come. However, that still did not mean he did not need companionship from people who enjoyed what he did and where the soul focus was not on something that had been stressing him out. 

Because Martinez had his falling out with Ivorn, he was off the table, leaving Martinez with only two male friends on the planet: the ever-busy Feinel and the generally equally occupied Ezol. 

Ezol would not be in attendance today; something was going on with his wife and their extended family, so only Fienel would be here today. 

Martinez joined Fienel on the beanbags in the living room, setting his beer on the coffee table. At the same time, the sounds of the girls laughing only grew in fervor. Glancing back at them, the three seemed to be laughing about something to do with Lira. It did not take a genius to figure out what their topic of mockery was. 

Lysa leaned onto Perla's arm, looking at her tall companion with mocking puppy dog eyes. “Oh, what strong arms you have,” she laughed. 

“You have such lovely white fur,” Perla growled, brushing hair out of Lysa’s face while dropping her voice an octave and mimicking Fienel’s gruff speech patterns. 

Lira buried her head between her palms and let out a long, low whine. Though it was physically impossible for their species, Martinez could have sworn he watched Lira's cheeks turn red as her friends made light of her embarrassment. 

“So, you and Lira?” Martinez raised a brow.

“Yeah—that finally happened,” Feinel shrugged. 

Martinez knew that the two Jurintik had been dancing around the idea for several years. Their main hang-up had been the typical expectations behind how Jurintik relationships worked. 

Typically, their species had a bit of a female-dominated dating dance, which would involve the woman essentially staking her claim on a man and the relationship taking its course from there. 

However, Martinez knew that Fienel and Lira were atypical for their species. Fienel was generally far more aggressive and acted on what he desired. In contrast, Lira was actually a rather shy soul who detested violence and never tried to act selfishly—her time sparing and practicing martial arts was a notable exception. 

It was good to see that the two of them had finally decided it was time to take their relationship to the next level. In all honesty, Martinez was getting tired of watching them beat around the bush, worried the other would not mesh with their eccentricities. 

Everyone at the dojo knew their hang-ups and saw they were perfect for one another—the only ones unable to see that were the trepidatious potential pair. 

Teacher was more than willing to openly mock both about their yearning glances during practice, an act that likely did nothing to persuade them to take the plunge. 

“Well, good,” Martinez held up his beer in a salute. 

“Took me long enough,” Feinel replied, clanking his glass against his friend’s. “Now then, let me tell you about this new N.U.G.I.T. (New Useless Guy in Training).”

Feinel went on to explain all the fun he had been having over the last month and a half with his brand-new rookie. The man was apparently of the same race as Sursee, so he was a small, feline-like species that stood at most a meter tall. 

Martinez already wondered about the man's viability as a beat cop because of his size, but the fact that he acted very typical of that bubbly and empathetic species only made him wonder how in all the universe that little man was going to manage in the big bad city of Draun. 

Apparently, that was exactly the issue Fienel was running into with the man. He was too open, forgiving, and willing to look the other way. Now, even Fienel agreed that as long as it was nothing serious, he was more than happy to slap someone with a fine or a warning, but this NUGIT was unreal. 

The other week, they were responding to some domestic situation across town; once on site instead of control the situation, separate the people involved, and work out the details, this man started an impromptu therapy session right there. 

Now, this was not all rainbows and sunshine. It started out heated: screaming, tossing plates, insults, and one even punching the NUGIT in the face. Yet despite all of that, the NUGIT was insistent. He stayed calm and patient and let them air out their emotions. They even hugged him when, through some kind of verbal jujutsu that Fienel was still trying to understand, he got both of them to start crying and pouring their hearts out to the police. 

Apparently, the off-the-wall tactic actually worked out well. While the couple's problems had not entirely ended, it had allowed the police to provide the pair with resources for therapy and even some financial relief. An issue that the rookie had uncovered was one of the primary problems the couple was facing. 

“That's unusual,” Martinez said, still not entirely believing everything about how things had gone down. 

“I swear it was. He is some kind of wizard,” Feinel laughed, “Plus, working with him is much better than tolerating Surail. That ass hole would have just shot the man and traumatized the woman.” 

“What happened to him anyway? I haven't seen him in a few—fuck months,” Martinez questioned, only now realizing he had not seen Officer Surail since before things with Shiksie had gone south. 

Feinel leaned back in his beanbag chair, “No one is sure. He just left, dropped off his gun and gear, and poof. Sure, there are rumors about him being quietly pushed out of the force for various reasons, but none that command will confirm—likely for some political reason.” 

Martinez could understand Surail being removed for quiet reasons. The man was not right. While Martinez could not confirm anything, the way he treated arrested persons, acted when he was on patrol alone, and his general demeanor did not add up.

The man seemed crooked, lacking the empathy, professionalism, and general attitude of most of the Draun PD officers. 

At least that meant Martinez would no longer have to deal with Surail coming around the Trauma Center and causing issues for him anymore. The man was a downright menace with how he treated even people who simply were drunk and needed to sleep off the booze. 

“Well, good riddance,” Martinez said, “I hated that guy.” 

“Yeah, I feel that,” Feinel replied, finishing his beer. 

“Another?” Martinez asked. 

“Sure,” Feinel smiled, his tail wagging at the offer. 

As Martinez stood, the alarm he had set on the roast went off, something Perla noticed. She dropped the conversation the girls were having in a picosecond, stood, and started toward the oven. 

Martinez moved to intercept the living food disposal, something he could do quite easily. She may be large, but Perla was not blinding fast, especially while being careful not to spill the drink she was carrying. 

“Hold up there, big girl, I will bring us all dinner,” Martinez said, using his body to shield the oven and his pain-staking work from the already drooling woman. 

“But I wanna eat,” Perla pouted. 

“We will, Perla,” Lysa said, stepping beside her friend and lightly tapping her knuckles against the woman's side. ""Help me set the table, then we can all eat.” 

Perla looked at Lysa with a bit of a pout on her lips, which she was exaggerating to look more apathetic. “Lysa Martinez is trying to starve me,” she whined. 

Lysa smiled and brought her hands up to cover her mouth in equally feigned shock before looking at Martinez. “Ruh'ah, I never expected you to be so cruel to Perla.” She shifted to guide Perla to the plates she had staged earlier. “Worry not. We will ensure you get your first choice of cut for dinner, and you can choose the movie once we are done, okay?” 

“Okay,” Perla smiled, happily helping Lysa set the table. 

“Fienel, dinner is ready,” Lira yelled. 

“Yeah, lover boy, get in here,” Martinez echoed. 

“You are one to talk,” Feinel yelled back, lumbering into the dining room. ""At least my girlfriend is not pregnant.""

""Yet,"" Perla added without missing a beat. 

That got a laugh from everyone—even Lysa, something Martinez had not been hearing enough of lately. That she was laughing, and enjoying her time made all the efforts of wrangling the passionate Perla worth it.

The rest of the evening was honestly surreal for Martinez and Lysa. With everything that had been going on that night, just being with their friends was some much-needed rest. 

They savored every moment, Perla devouring half of the roast, the sound of each jubilant laugh as they watched a comedy special Perla chose. But above it all, they cherished that for that short little time, life felt normal—something that would not last for long. 



\-------

So what did you all think of this one? It was a bit of a more relaxing chapter, showing a bit more of the slice of life the pair needs in these trying times, something we will see more of as we go; until its time for Martinez to pay the piper, then we get to have the hectic hell he will be dealing with. 

Please do not forget to updoot and comment.

1jg5mxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosleeping/comments/1jg5mxk/new_cosleeper/,New cosleeper?,"Hi all,

Hoping for some advice/guidance on if co sleeping is appropriate for me and my baby and any guidance you may have 

- My baby is 9 weeks old. 
- I do not exclusively breastfeed. I predominantly feed expressed breast milk by bottle with some formula as well. I do nurse my babe but it’s typically just comfort nursing and the odd snack. 
- my baby was small for gestational age at birth, 6 pounds 3 ounces at 41 weeks
- it would just be me and baby in bed, husband is away for work

Anything I’ve looked at says that breastfed babies and babies who were not born early/small are very low risk. Wondering if these risk factors we have then mean I should not consider co sleeping at all. I’m a little desperate but also terrified to do the wrong thing with bed sharing. 

My husband and I had been often sleeping sitting upright on the couch with babe snuggled up on our chest until I learned that was like the most dangerous way to co sleep. I was horrified and still feel so guilty. Now when it’s my shift with the baby each night I try to get him to sleep in the bassinet and when he doesn’t end up sleeping in the bassinet I’ll make a cup of coffee and hold him while I’m awake. Basically I just don’t sleep when it’s my turn to be with him at night. My husband is going away for a mandatory work trip though next week so I’ll be solo parenting. I’m so scared about nighttime because I won’t be able to take shifts with my husband during this time. Goodbye to my guaranteed 4 hours of sleep. 

I am desperate for any advice, guidance or encouragement you have to help me get through this week. I know there are millions of solo parents out there so I feel so stupid for being nervous about being alone with my literal child for a week. It’s really just the sleeping part though that is stressing me out because I’m just not sure how I will safely go about this without my husband there to make sure I get a 4 hour chunk of sleep. 

If you got this far thank you so much for taking the time to read. I really appreciate your guidance❤️",1,1742521241.0,cosleeping,2,1.0,False

1jg5gnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1jg5gnj/signs_of_alcoholic_partner_it_doesnt_seem_as/,"Signs of alcoholic partner? (It doesn't seem as extreme as most here, but...)","Hi Everyone,

I have been reading through the sub and a lot of stories on here sound much more extreme than my own experience, so perhaps I am overthinking things, however I've been dating someone (both mid 30s) now for several months and am starting to wonder about his drinking habits. 

We went out a few times last summer and I then heard rumors from some colleagues about his drinking, which put me off seeing him and I put distance between us.

We then started dating again in early January. We enjoy similar, niche physical activities - extreme backcountry hiking, skiing, etc - that many other people do not and I think that's largely why I dated him to begin with and got back together with him.

A few colleagues who knew him but didn't know I was romantically involved with him mentioned to me last summer that he had a reputation for excessive drinking when his name came up (we all work in the same field and in a small city, so everyone ends up knowing each other). One guy mentioned he'd been ticketed in a road rage incident after someone cut him off. He got out of the car and started yelling at the other driver, the other driver punched him, and my Q was ticketed for provoking the fight. Another colleague mentioned my Q had been part of her friend group but that they'd distanced themselves from him after his drinking became problematic. It's not clear what happened - I didn't ask, she didn't say - but she also showed me some really crass, off color comments he'd made on various women's social media profiles. I thought it was gross and also mortifying and distanced myself from him at that point. 

In December, he showed up at a work event for our field and was super nice and supportive. We got back in touch and hung out a few times, doing non-drinking activities, and I had a great time and thought, ""Well maybe see if he's changed or perhaps your colleagues were exaggerating his behaviors."" 

*HOWEVER*, I quickly noticed some of his old patterns. He doesn't start working until mid-day (presumably because he's hungover) and most of his work is done in bars/breweries. He claims that this is because he likes to socialize with people, but you could conceivably do work at a coffee shop if that's the case. He typically stops by his office in the afternoon and chats with his business partner, then goes to do work at several breweries, then moves off to a few bars or wine shops, then ends the night a dive bar where he works for several hours. I'm fairly sure he is ethically walking a fine line doing his work under the influence in our field. 

On one occasion, I tried to keep up drinking with him and ended up getting sick (I didn't realize how much I'd consumed and was mortified). After that, whenever we go out, he goes, ""You shouldn't have more than two drinks, you need to take it easy"" (which, fair, my limit is about 2-3 drinks), however he goes on to have 5, 6 drinks and typically wants to continue even though at that stage I'm just sitting in a bar with him sucking on water (which is boring for me). 

A few times he made insulting comments about my decor - ""it is classy, but I want cozy"" - and made comments about how if we lived together (in the house I own) he wanted a say in decorating because my house looks too much like a museum. There were also some other nasty remarks he made on cohabitating. This happened on multiple occasions and I finally told him he'd crossed a line. His excuse was that he'd been drinking. It still pisses me off. 

I think that incident spurred him to cut back on his drinking, as he says he's now mixing having beer/hard liquor with soft drinks - ie, he has a beer, then a coke, then a beer, then a coke. Sure it's cutting back but it still seems like a lot, particularly because we can't really plan dates in the evening or on the weekends, barring a few exceptions, because he has to work at night on the weekends because ""I'm not very productive during the week,"" (again, is it because of his drinking while doing work). 

Anyway this is long and rambling. He never seems drunk but everything about his behavior/lifestyle indicates to me someone who has a dependence on alcohol that is impacting his relationships with other people and perhaps his own life given how he structures his days. 

I do like this person and I think he means very well but I also think, particularly as I type this out, that he is showing signs of alcohol use disorder. Should I cut and run? Is it worth addressing this with him? I'm honestly not too sure he's going to change and I think he might blow up if I mention it. But the flip is: I would continue to date him if he could get it under control and we could do things together in the evenings/weekends that were sober or, even, have a drink or two but end it at that.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jg5ed8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jg5ed8,[📣Beta] v2.1 Savings goals now organized & new income entry screen,"Hi everyone!

We’ve been hard at work on the next big update, v2.1. Here's what's new:

**Savings goals now organized**

Previously, savings goals and spread-out expenses were grouped under *Expenses*—which was confusing 🫤 Here's what's new:

• **\[Log\]** Savings goals now live under *Savings*. Spread-out expenses stay under *Expenses*.

• **\[Savings Jar Graph\]** New savings goals will appear in your *Savings Jar* graph—making the graph more accurate and your progress easier to see.

• **\[Menu\]** To create a new savings goal, just tap the piggy jar toggle on the main screen and select **“Savings goal”** from the menu.

• **\[Older Goals\]** Your previous savings goals are still under *Expenses*. You can convert them to the new savings goal anytime. Just go to: **Log > open an entry > Convert to savings goal**.

• **\[Withdraw When Ready\]** Once you’ve saved 100% of your goal, you’ll be able to withdraw the target amount.

**Personalized Income Entry Screen**

The income entry screen used to feel cluttered—with templates like “Rent income” or ""Pension"" that didn’t apply to many people but couldn’t be edited.

We’ve cleaned it up! Now, you’ll only see income entries you’ve actually used before. Your screen stays relevant.

**Download link:** [https://testflight.apple.com/join/BzZSSUsm](https://testflight.apple.com/join/BzZSSUsm)

A couple of things to keep in mind:

⚠️ **Premium Features**

When you download the beta, premium features might be locked. To unlock, just choose “Premium – One Time.” Don’t worry—you won’t be charged for beta versions. You’ll see a confirmation screen to reassure you.

🧐 **If You’ve Beta Tested Befor**e

You might need to scroll down in TestFlight and tap **“Stop Testing”** before downloading this new version.

I don't know why,  but he's addicted to his iPad and watching nursery ryhmes like abcs or whatever, I tell him not to since he's a little too old for that but he just doesn't seem to care. It's affected how other people look at him and he gets rejected from playing with our relatives.

He also throws tantrums and bursts out crying when unable to do something. I have to help him study at home because he's just incapable and too lazy to do it himself. But even when I tell him things dozens of times over, especially in language arts, he just doesn't understand. Like how I'm teaching him how to do opinion writing, he just cannot create an opinion for himself. Whenever I give example, he just copies mine and does it slightly different. (E.x: I give: Coffee is the worst drink) He gives: Tea is the worst drink. I'm so tired of it. He also can't speak clearly when giving his input.

He always gets ignored by others for how he acts and it breaks my heart every time, but I dont know how to defend him because he's never once acted properly. 

I get really frustrated sometimes when he ignores me  and makes me think I'm talking to a wall and yell at him, and then he cries even more, i just don't know what to do anymore. I know this won't fix with time, please give me advice on how to help him. My mom also just doesn't seem to care and keeps giving him whatever he wants. When his devices are taken, they are given right back in like 10 minutes. Whenever he's punished, it's like a light slap on the wrist and a ""don't do it again."" But he does it time and time again. I don't know what to do anymore. He's in 6th grade now, it won't take long before he's in highschool, I can't imagine him acting like this even at the age of 13 or 14.

1jg596p,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1jg596p/my_tahajjud_and_isthikara_success_stories_to_give/,My Tahajjud and Isthikara success stories - to give hope to others (Alhumdulillah),"Salam everyone, and Ramadan Kareem. 

As we enter the last 10 nights on this holy month, I wanted to share some of the positive experiences I have had over the last 6 months to inspire hope to those who feel like they are struggling with their faith due to tests they are currently undergoing. I know when I was at the lowest point 6 months ago, I was scanning Reddit for these stories so I thought I’d create a thread here for us all to share and inspire each other and reaffirm our belief in Allah (SWT). 

1. Last year I moved to a new country by myself, I’m a single female and I moved for a better life and opportunity in the Middle East. The job I transferred with was horrible, I was fired after 2 months after reporting sexual harassment against me. I was in despair, somewhere new, not being paid, 10 years of working to being fired was unprecedented. I felt helpless. Prior to this, for context, my faith had never really been consistent . I missed prayers, and didn’t consider Islam very much. 

I started to pray 5x a day. I’d wake up for Tahajjud. A ton of people told me to leave and go back home, but my mum supported me mentally and told me to stick it out. Allah had sent me here for a reason, see how much I could bear. I did Isthikara every night to help guide me to the decision I had made - to stay, and to make it easier on me.

I finally started landing interviews after finding the strength to start networking extensively. I built a huge network. One hiring manager went back and forth with me for weeks on a role - he was very hard on me, I didn’t like him and didn’t want the job and hoped something else would come along. He gave the job to someone else, but I was still distraught as I needed a job. A month later, he told me to meet him for coffee. Another 1,5 hours of him grilling me, asking if I was a difficult employee, what I’d learnt from
The experience at my last place. To be honest, at this point I was not happy. If he wanted to give me the job, just give it to me! He had so much doubt about me in his head. 

Until he did give me the job. I was anxious, reluctant, worried I’d be watched like a hawk, going from one terrible job to another. 

I’ve just completed week 5 and ALHUMDULLILAH I am so happy here. He has warmed to me, is genuinely kind and so are the rest of my team. Inshallah this continues, I pass my probation and I continue to do a good job. 

2. A prayer that was answered almost overnight. My dad died 12 years ago . Since then, almost weekly I have dreamt about him - he is always sick (like he was before he died) and I always seem to abandon or forget him in these dreams. In my sleep I remember that he’s passed away, but then he’s come back to life and ‘haunts me’ whilst sick in these dreams but I forget and abandon him which brings me guilt. I genuinely think it’s because after he died, i wasn’t committed to my faith. I never prayed. I never prayed for him. After I started mentioning his name during Tahajjud, asking Allah to forgive his sins, protect him from the fire, make his Kabar ful of light, and his journey to the day of judgement pass quickly, things changed. I asked Allah to send my apologies to my father for abandoning him in real life, for not praying for him, not sending my Duas or love or blessings to him. 
Guess what? It’s the longest it’s been since I slept and saw of him in that  horrible state. Allah answered my prayer almost immediately. It was like I was abandoning him in life, and that was haunting me in my sleep .

3. My grandma. She is nearly 90 and has been very unwell the last few months. On and off every week we have thought it is her time to pass. I pray diligently in Tahajjud that my grandma get to see me meet a righteous partner, and hold my children, as Allah can make anything possible. Alhumdulillah, over the last two days, she has made miraculous improvements that no one can believe. 

My point is, not all of our Duas will come through instantly but I have been convinced that they are heard and are delayed, accepted immediately or something better comes our way. 

My faith has been strengthened immensely the last few months. 

When you are in difficulty, turn to Him and he will guide you, he will heal you, he will do the impossible. When you are in moments of joy, STILL turn to him, and thank Him. Never forget him and his mercy and generosity. 

We are not perfect, and we are not meant to be. This was always something I worried about - I was all or nothing. But knowing that I am trying my hardest, and even if I make a mistake, my intentions are pure - that in itself pleases Allah. We will make mistakes, but we have the chance to repent and continue to try to be better, even if we make the same mistake over and over. He is the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful, and delays any punishment to give us time to amend our ways. 

I still have my tests currently in my life, but my Tawwakul is strong. I know Allah has it figured out for me in a way I can’t even imagine. That is so comforting. But it took time to get here, took time to truly let myself believe fully. I am here for anyone who was in my place a few months ago and is struggling to surrender, it doesn’t make you a bad person, it’s just your test.

I have never felt more confident that I will find and complete my Deen, the desire Allah has put in my heart is so strong and Inshallah it is granted. But I feel so assured because I submitted. I know what is for me, will never pass me by. Everything will be okay, because He is watching over us. How beautiful. There is never any need for anxiety, He has it all planned for us. 

And remember, Kun Fa-Ya Kun: Be, and it is. 

May the last ten nights bring you ample blessings and may all of your fasts be accepted. 

I hope my stories have brought some hope to those struggling, and Inshallah we ALL continue to reap the benefits of our worship.

P.S. large piece in first pic is Catalpa. It’ll be my first attempt at a coffee table. Live edge with a waterfall end. Leave the legs long enough to cut square if that goes sideways. Milled from 2-1/4” to 1-3/4” and she warped after the fact while kept in a climate controlled apartment. 1/8” cup side to side, 1/4” cup end to end. Learned after the fact that the grain pattern I picked tends to do that and warp can occur after milling, even when dried properly. Going to get creative and round over the waterfall edge a bit to hide the cup. Might not be perfect, but it’s a first attempt and will hold the tv remote just fine! Next time I’ll def be a bit more selective on grain pattern.

Drop a comment share your thoughts 'don't be a stranger' could make a group, share the shit we like and see how everything flows, amongst busy lives and being broke theres a shit ton of fun stuff to do just gotta add the people with spirit so bring it on! :)

1jg4suw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jg4suw,Goodbye Taylor 😭💔,"I will never forget the day I met Taylor. I remember picking her up with my parents and on the way home, my ex-boyfriend and I were trying to come up with the perfect name for her. Her original name was Creamer because her sister's name was Coffee. We tossed around different ideas when Taylor Swift's You Belong with Me started playing, and at that moment, it just felt right-Taylor did belong with me.
From that day on, she was by my side through everything.
She was there through college, my first love, and losing my first love. After my first heartbreak, we lived with my friend's family while I picked up the pieces of my life again.

She was there through the jobs I hated, my 21st birthday, and even having her own puppies, who she loved so much. She was not thrilled when I brought home her sister, Sadie, but eventually, they became friends. She was there when I met my now husband, and more importantly, she approved of him. She moved with me from home to my first apartment with my husband, then to our house. She was there when we got her brother, Dexter, through the heartbreak of losing my brother, through many eventful Halloween parties, the walks she loved, and our bike rides together. She was with me as I entered my 30s, through so many holidays, and as we added Bird, GiGi, and Lana to our family. 

Over the years, my sweet princess grew older, but she never stopped being there for me. I told her my secrets and held her through so many tears, and in return, she kissed me and made everything feel okay.
At the end of January, we lost Sadie. She was my comfort during that time, even though I knew she was also sad. We then lost our bird, Bird. 
Not long after, we noticed how thin she was getting and how little she was eating. We were devastated to learn she had kidney disease. She took a bad turn last week and had to be hospitalized. We had such high hopes that she would recover, that we would get a few more years together. But that isn't the news we got.

Instead of letting her pass away scared and alone in an animal hospital, we decided to bring her home to fill her final moments with love, warmth, and peace.
She passed surrounded by her friends, family, and her brother and sisters. 

Taylor, I will love you and miss you forever. You will always be my princess. Losing Sadie shattered my heart, but now, with you gone, I feel like a massive piece of it is missing. I don't have the words to describe the love I have for you or the depth of my grief. But one day, I know I'll see you again. I'll run across that rainbow bridge, scoop you and Sadie up in my arms, and feel the love and happiness you both have always given me.

I love you, Taylor. I will miss you for the rest of my life.",90,1742518660.0,chihuahuas,11,1.0,False

1jg4rsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1jg4rsj/8_weeks_5_days_medical_route/,"8 weeks 5 days, medical route","After 7 months of TTC, we found out on Valentine’s Day that I was pregnant.  Went in on Monday to finally see our little one only to find a gestational sac and tiny, tiny yolk sac but no visible baby or heartbeat.  I was shocked.  They did hcg bloodwork and it was extremely high (around 123,000) to not see a fetal pole so had me come in today for another ultrasound which showed the same thing.  I was so hoping the ultrasound tech had just screwed up.

They confirmed a blighted ovum.  Is this because my baby had some sort of abnormality?  If that’s true, I’m glad I found out sooner rather than later but it still hurts.

I’ve been incredibly sick the past few weeks (almost constant nausea) along with the other normal first trimester things, fatigue, sore breasts, peeing a lot, a little cramping but nothing that scared me…. Never in a million years did I ever let my mind wander to this possibility.  It really sucks to be relentlessly sick for the last 4-5 weeks only to NOT get a baby at the end of this journey. 

Now I’m just ready to not feel dizzy when I smell coffee again and have enough energy to work.  I’m ready to move on and hopefully at some point try again.

I was given the normal 3 options: miso, natural, or D&c and I chose the miso.  I just took it at 7:15pm along with Percocet and zofran.  I’m working remote tomorrow.  I’m super scared of what comes next, but heartbroken that this happened.  I live in the Deep South in a very red state so there’s a lot of fear over what’s available in these types of scenarios and I’m thankful I was given the option of what route to take, even though I’m still uncertain of whether that was the right option.  

We will see how this goes.  Sending love to everyone going through this.  It’s truly not fair.",2,1742518568.0,Miscarriage,3,1.0,False
1jg4r0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1jg4r0x/lets_talk_about_airports_not_all_but_most_a_low/,"Let's talk about Airports. Not all. But most, a low vibrational, vampire, energy sucking and harvesting portal of misery. An Archonic Feeding frenzy. I know, I'm here as I right this.","I'm sure this post won't get many views and might get deleted because it's low vibe. But I believe it's something to look out for or just out right avoid. But the energy I have always felt inside large airports, especially tonight, is extremely low vibrational with the feeling of it literally designed to be an Archon Hive energy feeding frenzy. It's so damn tiring, most people, especially those that work here, are straight up NPC's with literally no soul, pissed off and literally get off on being ass holes to people. No body is friendly, people are rushing and don't want to be bothered. Getting help from anyone is gymnastics in itself. Nobody seems to happy at all, it can appear strange for some reason. Like some hell realm. Again sorry to sound so low vibe, but I'm here right now while writing this. 

All I'm doing now is smiling, remaining friendly and treating people the way I would like to be treated. keeping myself high around busy low vibe energy's. I went to the food court to ask for some ice, and the nasty lady at the coffee shop said ""no ice, try next door"" clearly she was lying, then said some smart ass remark to her employee. Never seen this women in my life and is showing me she is a disgusting person. I go next door and the women in the restaurant smiled at me as I smiled back and she gave me a big free cup of ice. I was very appreciative and it turned my night around. 

I understand if we are to give off the same unfriendly disgusting energy to match places like this, then the archons have one and they feed off of us. The discipline is to remain high, or somewhat high if possible, and unplug from the misery, the negative energies, don't let them effect you and remain in a bubble of joy and freedom. That pisses off the Archons and the negative people who want to be nasty. Their nastiness just rewinds back on them. So my advice is to just remain high and unplug if you ever have to experience having to put up being in a energy field such as this. 

Raise the low vibration. Some say that's what we are here to do. ",16,1742518502.0,starseeds,7,0.87,False
