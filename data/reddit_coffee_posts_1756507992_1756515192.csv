I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1756515013.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

1n3o8xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1n3o8xb/i_applied_atomic_habits_for_30_days_and_it/,I applied Atomic Habits for 30 days and it completely changed my life,"I was skeptical about another productivity book promising to ""change everything."" But after 30 days of actually applying James Clear's methods from Atomic Habits, I'm a different person.

Here's what happened when I stopped reading about habits and started building them:

* I started stupidly small. Instead of ""I'm gonna work out for an hour every day,"" I committed to one push-up. That's it. Sounds dumb, right? But I actually did it. One turned to five. Then five turned to 10. I now do 20 pushups in a set when it's chest day.
* I made it impossible to fail. Put my workout clothes right next to my bed. Left a water bottle on my nightstand. Put a book on my pillow. When I woke up, healthy stuff was literally in my face. I also stopped buying junk food and soda's. No more fast food deliveries too.
* I piggybacked on stuff I already do. ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do my push-up."" ""After I pour coffee, I'll read one page."" I attached new habits to things I was already doing automatically. Same thing where I'll meditate after making my bed.

What happened week by week:

* Week 1: Doing my one push-up feeling like an idiot. But hey, I did it every day.
* Week 2: Started doing 5 push-ups because one felt too easy. Read 2-3 pages because one wasn't enough.
* Week 3: 15-20 push-ups felt normal. Reading for 10-15 minutes became automatic.
* Week 4: Full 30-minute workouts. Reading 30+ pages daily. It just happened. I realized this what compound growth means.

I stopped thinking of myself as lazy. I became ""someone who works out daily"" and ""someone who reads."" My brain literally rewired itself.

What I learned:

* Small and consistent beats big and sporadic every time. I'd rather do one push-up every day for a year than 100 push-ups once.
* Your environment matters more than your willpower. If you make good choices easier and bad choices harder, you'll naturally do better.
* Missing one day doesn't matter. Missing two days in a row starts a bad pattern.

Biggest mistake I made was tying to change everything at once. I focused on just two habits exercise and reading. That's it.

If you want to try this: just Pick ONE tiny habit. Make it so small it feels almost stupid. Do it for 30 days. Don't worry about results, just show up.

I went from zero exercise and zero books to working out daily and reading 2-3 books a month. Not because I became more disciplined, but because I made it easier.",2,1756514799.0,Discipline,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Giants vs. Orioles: A Tale of Two Parks (and One Very Confused TV Schedule)**

The San Francisco Giants, fresh off a season where they’ve been favored 77 times (and failed to capitalize 39 of those times, because *of course*), host the Baltimore Orioles in a matchup that’s part “Friday Night Baseball” and part “why is this game on Apple TV+?!” The Giants, with their 3.70 ERA and pitching staff that could probably hold a coffee cup without spilling it, face a Baltimore team that’s hit 160 home runs this year—enough to build a small bridge, if bridges were made of regrettable life choices.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers. The Giants are favored at -150 (implied probability: 60%), while the Orioles sit at +225 (33.3%). The spread? Giants -1.5, Orioles +1.5. The total runs line is a modest 7.5, which feels about right for a game where the Giants’ 1.281 WHIP suggests they’ll keep things tight, and the Orioles’ 1.370 WHIP implies they’ll let the Giants’ offense do the same.

Key players? Robbie Ray for the Giants, who’s struck out 158 batters like he’s just really bad at a game of “Don’t Swing.” His 2.93 ERA is better than my dating profile’s honesty. On the Orioles’ side, Gunnar Henderson (.277, 16 HRs) is their golden goose, while Rafael Devers (.258, 27 HRs) has been a mixed bag for the Giants, his .796 OPS this season a sad echo of his .905 with the Red Sox. Imagine if Devers were a toaster—still functional, but no longer the breadwinner.

**News Digest: Injuries, Streaming, and Existential Crises**  
No major injuries here, which is surprising. The Orioles haven’t tripped over their own shoelaces (yet), but let’s talk about their 60-74 record. That’s like a student who aced the first exam, then realized the final was worth 90% of the grade and decided to major in “meh.” The Giants, meanwhile, are a team that’s been favored more than a vegan at a BBQ—often, and with little hope of a successful outcome.

As for streaming? This gam

* The mudroom/office space is where their kids will do their homework, they will do some work. Talks about adding built-in cubbies and shelving in the future. 

* Previous owners left a fridge and chest freezer behind in the garage for them.

* She loves their kitchen, the counters, color of cabinets, hardware. Talks about watching their kids play in the yard from the kitchen window.

* Previous owners left behind the dining table and chairs. Talks about using the built-in cabinets under the chalkboard as a coffee bar or baby bottle bar (you can’t make this stuff up)

* in the room that used to have a pool table, they’re taking out the hanging light so they don’t knock into it. Putting a TV in the corner with a big comfy couch. Can’t wait to sit in the bay window seat and read. 

* first room upstairs will be her “work room” because the lighting is great. She’ll take videos up there, so get ready for more try on hauls with the same boring backdrop from her house because she’s too lazy and self conscious to put effort into taking photos in a better environment

* the room across the hall is the biggest room, which will either be a guest room or the nursery. Probably the guest room. She messes with the lights which don’t turn on and Nick dully says that the bulb is probably off and it’s not a big deal. He likely hates his assigned job of filming her content.

* Upstairs bathroom is not updated but still livable. She wants to eventually redo the tub and tiling but it works. That will likely be the bathroom she does her makeup in. (God, her life is so boring that these are the things she thinks about in her new house)

* Room with the dark blue wall will likely be the baby’s room.

Then she shows the closet which she literally describes as “my closet. This is the biggest closet I’ve ever had.” Nick apparently gets his own closet. Primary bathroom is the one downfall, apparently, because it’s small.

* She turns off all the lights.. “those are in our name now.” So she just left all the lights on in her parents’ house because she wasn’t paying the bills? Makes sense for a brat like her.

1n3nzyz,https://i.redd.it/zl44tgz4y1mf1.jpeg,Twisted Lies,"Looking for this book:

I found an old iPhone by accident.It contained a video of my husband and sister making out.
Damien’s voice, slurred but distinct. “You shouldn’t be here,” 
She smooched the corner of his jaw. “That never stopped you before.”
“I’m marrying your sister tomorrow.”
“You don’t love her like you love me.”
Silence stretched.
Then, a whisper.
“No. I don’t.”
Kelly smooched him. Slow. Deep. Hungry. 
I couldn’t breathe.
“I always wanted you,” he growled. “You knew that.”
“You’re drunk,” she purred.
“You came anyway.”
“I always come when it counts.”
The moan that followed snapped something inside my chest. Their bodies tangled, urgent and shameless. 
I watched every second.
Every.
Single.
Second.
Until the screen went black.
————————
They said every great love story began with a spark. Cassie King’s began with a lie. She didn’t see it at first. Not in the way Damien smiled at her across the ballroom. Not in the way his hand found hers beneath linen-draped tables.
Not in the whispered promises that curled like smoke in the night. No, the lie came gently. Wrapped in silk and roses, in murmured endearments and grand gestures. In the way he smooched her like she was the only woman who ever existed. In the way he married her. Vows etched in gold, forever promised before hundreds of watching eyes. But even then, forever had a shadow.
It watched from the front row in crimson heels and a knowing smile. It wore her sister’s face. Cassie never expected to become the woman who was betrayed. She was the good one. The perfect wife.
She loved Damien Sterling with every part of her soul until the night she discovered he never stopped loving someone else.
Now, on the eve of their second anniversary, as champagne chills in silver buckets and her heart thuds quietly beneath a silk gown, Cassie prepares for the celebration he believes she planned out of love but this time, her vow isn’t one of devotion.
It’s revenge.

The Perfect Wife
The smell of jasmine and vanilla candles curled through the penthouse suite like a whisper, delicate and intoxicating. Cassandra King moved gracefully across the marble floors, barefoot, her silk robe flowing behind her as she inspected the final details of the anniversary surprise she had spent the last week secretly preparing. Every corner of the space reflected intention from the chilled bottle of Cristal on the ice bucket stand to the vintage record player humming a soft jazz melody in the background.
The rooftop terrace glittered in the warm evening light. A private chef waited on standby, hidden behind the double doors, while a string quartet tuned their instruments quietly in the next room. Rose petals trailed a path from the bedroom to the rooftop, lit by soft golden candlelight.
Two years.
It had been two years since she said ""I do"" to Damien Sterling, the man who had once been the embodiment of every romantic fantasy she’d ever dared to believe in. The man who had smooched her forehead in boardrooms and held her hand beneath tables at society galas. The man who made her believe, against all odds, that she was his first and final choice.
And she had believed him. Every vow. Every touch. Every unspoken promise between the lines.
Cassie adjusted a silver fork on the formal dining setup, heart fluttering with both anticipation and an unfamiliar unease. She brushed it off as nerves. Every anniversary stirred memories. Some beautiful, some bittersweet but this night was about celebration, not doubt.
Delia, her executive assistant and closest confidante, stepped in quietly.
""The chef says everything will be ready on your cue and the terrace is fully prepped. You look stunning, by the way.""
Cassie offered a small, gracious smile. ""Thank you. I just want tonight to be... perfect.""
Delia hesitated, then added softly, ""He’s lucky to have you. Not every woman would go this far to keep the magic alive.""
Cassie looked out the floor-to-ceiling windows as the sun dipped below the Manhattan skyline. The suite was perched like a crown on top of the Kings Grand, one of Cassie’s luxury developments. Everything about their life screamed perfection: wealth, power, beauty. Yet somewhere between the golden surface, she often felt a chill she couldn't explain.
He hadn’t said much about the anniversary plans. But he was always busy. Always distracted lately. Still, she had brushed it off.
She stared down at the sparkling diamond ring on her finger. The same ring he had slipped onto her hand in a whirlwind proposal after a month of late-night confessions and undeniable chemistry. A proposal that silenced every lingering doubt she’d once harbored.
She’d loved him long before he even saw her.
The first time she met Damien, they were teenagers at a garden party hosted by his parents. He was already magnetic, already chased by every girl in their private school orbit. But he had eyes for her sister, Kelly,the golden girl. Cassie had watched from the sidelines, quiet and content to be unnoticed, secretly nursing her ache in silence.
Years later, fate and timing shifted. A misunderstanding. A few chance encounters. A night when Cassie comforted him after Kelly left the country on a modeling tour. And from then on, the tide turned. Or so she thought.
The elevator dinged.
Cassie's heart jumped. She straightened her shoulders, checked her reflection in the hallway mirror. Ivory dress hugging her curves, lips a soft rose, eyes lined just enough to draw focus but not steal it.
Damien stepped into the suite, loosening his tie with one hand, phone in the other. He didn’t notice the setup at first. Or her.
""You’re home late,"" she said, voice calm but deliberate.
He glanced up, startled. ""Cass... I thought we were meeting at the restaurant?""
Her smile faltered.
""I canceled the reservation. I thought a private evening here would be more... meaningful.""
His eyes scanned the room slowly, taking in the flickering lights, the roses, the dinner setup.
""You did all this?""
She nodded, stepping toward him. ""Happy anniversary.""
Damien blinked, then leaned in to smooch her cheek, slightly off-target.
""Right. Of course. Happy anniversary, baby. This is... incredible. I’m sorry, I got caught up in meetings.""
Cassie wrapped her arms around him, inhaling the faint scent of scotch and leather.
He had forgotten. He remembered only because she reminded him.
She smiled anyway.
Because perfect wives forgave. Perfect wives understood. And tonight, she would be the perfect wife one last time.
Before everything changed.
---
Champagne & Secrets
The party was everything the society pages would rave about by morning. Crystal chandeliers bathed the ballroom in a warm, opulent glow, and the curated guest list sparkled with the city’s most powerful elites. Waiters in black vests carried flutes of champagne on silver trays, and a jazz trio played soft, elegant notes that floated above the hum of polite laughter and whispered gossip.
Cassie moved through the crowd like she belonged because she did. Her custom navy silk gown hugged her in all the right places, her dark hair swept into an effortless twist. A smile played on her lips, the practiced kind that softened her features without revealing too much.
From across the room, Harper Linwood watched her.
""You’re smiling like a woman in love,"" Harper murmured as she handed Cassie a fresh glass of champagne.
Cassie took it, sipped. ""That’s the idea, isn’t it?""
Harper tilted her head, studying her. ""You’re always so put-together, Cass. Almost too put-together.""
Cassie didn’t answer. Instead, her eyes scanned the room until they found Damien. He stood near the bar with Leo Durant, laughing at something a man said. But there was a tension in his shoulders, a stiffness in his smile.
And then, the subtle shift: Damien excused himself, weaving toward the hallway behind the ballroom.
Cassie’s eyes narrowed.
She didn’t follow. Not right away. Instead, she waited, counted to twenty, then murmured to Harper, ""I’ll be right back.""
She walked slowly, her heels silent against the carpeted corridor. At the far end, the door to the coatroom stood ajar. Light spilled into the hallway. Voices filtered through, muffled.
Cassie paused. Heard Damien’s voice. Slurred, low.
""You know I love you... always have.""
Her stomach twisted.
""I just... tonight's hard, okay? It’s her anniversary, not ours.""
A pause.
""Yeah... yeah. I wish I could be with you instead.""
Cassie felt the blood drain from her face. Her body froze, every cell screaming denial.
Then came the clincher, ""I’ll leave her soon. I just need a little more time.""
Kelly’s voice was faint but unmistakable on the other end. Laughing. Mocking.
Cassie took a step back, heart hammering.
She didn’t cry. Didn’t collapse. She simply turned around, each movement deliberate, composed.
When she returned to the ballroom, Harper caught the flicker of something in her eyes.
""What happened?""
Cassie handed her the half-drunk champagne. ""I think I need something stronger.""
She smiled.
But this time, Harper noticed her smile didn’t reach her eyes.
--- 
The Forgotten Gift
The morning after the party, Cassie sat on the edge of their California king bed, her hands wrapped around a mug of black coffee gone cold. The penthouse was quiet, too quiet, except for the soft hum of the city waking up outside. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the skyline stretched endlessly, bathed in the pale gold of early light.
Damien was still asleep, sprawled across his side of the bed in a half-unbuttoned dress shirt and black slacks. His tie lay forgotten on the floor, his phone blinking with missed calls. Cassie stared at it for a moment longer than necessary before setting her cup down and rising to her feet.
There was no card on the vanity. No box on the nightstand. No bouquet waiting near the door.
No gift.
Two years of marriage. And not even a handwritten note.
She checked the closet, the hallway table, even the kitchen island where he’d once left a surprise diamond pendant on their first dating anniversary. Nothing.
Her stomach tightened.
Maybe he left it at the office. Maybe it was coming later. Maybe—
The elevator dinged.
Delia stepped out with her usual grace, holding a slim planner and a paper bag of croissants from Cassie’s favorite French bakery.
“Morning,” Delia said, eyes scanning Cassie’s expression. “You didn’t sleep?”
Cassie shook her head lightly. “Just woke up early.”
Delia placed the pastries down. “Want me to get started on your briefing for the investor brunch?”
“In a minute.” Cassie hesitated. “Did Damien… happen to leave anything with you for me?”
Delia blinked. “Like what?”
“An envelope. A gift. Anything.”
A pause. Then, gently, “No.”
Cassie nodded. Her lips tightened into something that wasn’t quite a smile. “Right.”
By noon, Damien emerged from the bedroom with sleep-tousled hair and a groggy face that under any other circumstance might’ve made her smile.
“Morning,” he mumbled, stretching. “What time is it?”
“Almost noon.”
He winced. “I was supposed to be in a call an hour ago.”
Cassie handed him his coffee, black and just the way he liked it. “You were tired.”
He smooched her cheek. “Last night was amazing. Seriously, thank you for everything you did.”
She nodded, searching his face. “Did you… forget something?”
He looked up from his coffee, blinking. “What do you mean?”
Cassie gave him a moment.
He glanced at her, then down at the cup, then away. “Oh. The gift.”
Her heart thudded softly.
“I… meant to have it delivered to the office yesterday, but things got crazy. I’ll bring it by tonight. I wanted it to be perfect.”
Cassie nodded slowly. “Of course. I understand.”
But the way his gaze slid to the floor said more than his words. There was no gift. There had never been one.
“Do you want to tell me what it was?” she asked, her voice gentle.
He hesitated. “A bracelet. Emerald. To match the one you wore at the gala last spring.”
Too specific. Too fast. Practiced.
Cassie smiled and leaned up to smooch his cheek. “I’m sure I’ll love it.”
He gave her a quick nod and disappeared into the bathroom. Cassie remained still, the air around her strangely heavy.
When the water began running, she picked up her phone and texted Delia one word “Check.”
Later that day, Cassie wandered through the Kings Grand’s grand ballroom for a final check before an upcoming gala. Her heels echoed against the high-gloss floor as she moved past gold-trimmed columns and crystal chandeliers.
Delia met her by the reception desk, tablet in hand.
“I checked the company card and Damien’s personal Amex. Three days ago, he bought a diamond bracelet from Raffin’e Jewelers. Not emerald.”
Cassie’s jaw clenched. “Shipping address?”
“Not listed. But the pickup signature was K. King.”
Her breath caught.
Kelly.
Her sister.
Of course it was.
Cassie swallowed, her mind racing. Her heart didn’t even ache. Not yet. Not the way it would. Not the way it used to. Right now, it just… observed.
“Thank you,” she said quietly.
Delia glanced around. “Want me to tell Harper?”
“No,” Cassie said. “Not yet. I need to think.”
Delia didn’t press.
That night, Damien came home with two glasses of wine and an apologetic smile.
“Got caught up again,” he said, smooching her forehead. “The gift’s still coming.”
Cassie took the glass from him and smiled.
“I can wait.”
And she would but not for the gift. She would wait to see just how far the lie would go and when the moment was right, she would make sure it ended exactly where it started. With her.
--- 
Delia was waiting for her the next morning in the corner booth of their usual café, low profile, tucked inside a bookstore. She slid a manila folder across the table. “I pulled his charge history again. Here’s the purchase. It wasn’t sent anywhere. It was signed for in person. And I found this.”
She unfolded a printout of a security cam photo, grainy but unmistakable. Kelly. Long blonde hair. Oversized sunglasses. Holding a Raffinée shopping bag and grinning.
Cassie’s stomach turned.
“She left from there and went to the Fifth Avenue spa,” Delia added. “One of Damien’s drivers picked her up. Same day.”
Cassie pressed her fingers to her temple. “He told me he had meetings. Said he was tied up with investors.”
Delia’s voice was gentle. “You okay?”
“No.”
“What do you want to do?”
Cassie closed her eyes. “I want to play the part. Just a little longer. Let them think I’m still clueless.”
She opened her eyes and looked directly at Delia. “And I want you to find out everything.”
Delia nodded. “Everything?”
“Dates. Times. Hotel rooms. Messages. I want a timeline that’s bulletproof. I want a story that doesn’t leave room for denial.”
Delia exhaled, as if bracing herself. “All right. You’ll have it.”
That evening, Cassie returned to the penthouse and made dinner. Damien walked in late, tossed his blazer on the arm of the couch, and smooched her cheek. “Sorry I missed lunch. Meeting ran long.”
She smiled. “Of course.”
He paused, looked at her. “You’re... being really patient with me lately.”
“Shouldn’t I be?”
“I mean, yeah. It’s just... things have been a little off. I’ve been distracted. Doesn’t mean I don’t care.”
Cassie handed him a glass of wine. “I know.”",1,1756514065.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

the way the ssv explained it i wasnt connecting well enough. i forgot to offer for here cups bc i wasnt aware of that being a rule at first and then i just kept forgetting, and i was told i was standing too much at the register and not being helpful but my other ssvs have told me to stay put on front sup. if theres not food to be ran or coffee to help with.  but now im in trouble for staying put and my ssv just ended up sending me straight home.

i know this can easily be my fault but my training was very lackluster and i still dont know how to do a lot of things and im physically + mentally disabled so i have a lot of trouble remembering new steps at first if im not constantly getting to practice and i was having a bad flare-up for the past few days so i havent been as smiley as i should be.

i just feel kind of humiliated and dont want to go back there, the ssv in question made me feel anxious before all this and im dreading having to go back in general. i wish it wasnt so strict now, i always thought this would be a fun place to work but instead im just always overwhelmed and in pain. :(",2,1756514039.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

I ended up writing about 3 small parts before I realized I didnt really have anyone to share with. I hope you guys enjoy your stay in our small town.


Welcome to Pine Ridge: An Introduction 

I have lived in the Pacific Northwest for the majority of my life and sometimes you see or hear something odd. Best thing you can do is pretend you didn't notice anything, close your eyes and go about your business. 

At first I was a bit skittish about telling people where exactly we live since it's a very small town, so small in fact that when I went to Google it I couldn't actually find it. The more I dug the more I started to realize that our little town might not actually exist in an official capacity, there are signs welcoming people in and even a town hall but when you look at the mail you see a post code for the city over. I asked a few neighbors about it, passing them a loaf of fresh bread for a dozen eggs and they told me “Don't know, something about the way the land intersected means you're just barely a city over. Walk across the road and you'll find yourself in another post code.” And looking at a map, they're right. Our town is on the border of the two closest cities and we sit in the middle. Unmarked but still here.

So I wanted to introduce you to our town, nestled deep into the mountain roads, far enough away from anywhere on the map, is Pine Ridge. You might drive through it on your way up to the mountains for some of the most scenic hikes you could ever walk in your life or maybe you blinked during the drive and missed it all together.

These long winding roads tend to make people dizzy and even a bit sleepy, if you drive our roads you might want to bring a friend or two with you to help you stay awake. You'd be surprised how often you'll see cars parked along these mountain roads and if you're driving home during twilight you might just see someone park their truck and walk off into those woods. I wouldn't recommend stopping them, I don't know why but my Aunt tells me it's best to leave them alone.

“They know where they're going.” She would tell me when I first started driving.

My aunt's name is Helena, well at least for you her name is Helena. Helena took in myself and my brothers when we were very young. I was a troubled kid and that was due to my parents divorce. One day everything was fine and the next they couldn't stand the sight of each other, next thing I knew we were living with my aunt while dad packed up the rest of our things. Shortly after he moved into her house, she sold her house and we moved to Pine Ridge. I'm not sure exactly why all this happened since I was so young, only that it did and that it was necessary but my aunt was an angel through it.

She was basically my mother for most of my life, we don't really know where our bio-mom went after the divorce, only that she had to “Get out of here. Go somewhere brighter.” And then she was gone. Since then we've all just been one big family.

We've lived in Pine Ridge for most of our lives now and we've become aware as we've gotten older that Pine Ridge isn't the most normal place. No one goes anywhere alone, that's one of the many rules that we have that others don't. No one walks outside alone, no one goes for a drive alone, you always take someone with you. People go missing here.

When we moved in there was a missing person support group run out of the local grocery store. We have no idea how they ran it, we were lucky enough to never have to go but we always watched. Every time we went out my aunt would remind us. “Okay, love you. Be safe and remember, watch who's watching you.” She would almost sing on the way out the door. “We know, people go missing in the Ridge. Love you too.”

Logically, we could chalk it up to possible human traffickers living in the incredibly small town but it never felt that way. Maybe I'm wrong but don't missing people usually get found once in a while? People don't just run away for a day and get found by police in Nevada, people just vanish in Pine Ridge. They leave behind everything from clothes to cars, personal belongings, and grieving mothers just trying to understand. It's sad but it's the world we live in.

Cases of people coming back are extremely rare, I think the only case I’ve heard of someone coming back might be Helena. 

Aunt Helena and Grandma were extremely close. They had endured Helena's divorce and Grandma's four husbands together. After Grampa number four passed on, Grandma moved in with Aunt Helena and after that they simply took care of each other. Until Grandma was suddenly rushed to the hospital. Aunt Helena received the news while she was at work and rushed to get to the hospital as soon as she could. That would be her last day working there, on her way out of town Helena had to go through one of the local reservations. To this day, she'll tell you not to speed in the Res, she claims it's because the Res cops are harder on those outside of the tribe but we know it's something deeper. Traffic cams caught her speeding through a red light just before she was on the Res and after that, there are no pictures of her car on the road that night.

She was missing for three days and when she returned she couldn't say where she had gone. She was taken to the hospital, doctors believe she was in a car accident but they never found her car. By the time they found her, Grandma had passed on. I still remember that first night she came home, there was no grief in her, no sadness. When she finally spoke she didn't even look at us.

“It was an angel… A great and terrible angel…”

She struggled with her faith after that, rapidly shifting between blind devotion and a constant questioning of everything she had ever known. I think it was the guilt. She was gone while her mother laid in the hospital, she wasn't alone, we were there of course but Helena wasn't there. It messes a person up. I tried to ask her about the angel later when she was doing better but she didn't really answer. She waved her hand, called me silly for bringing it up and asked me to pass her something she was looking for in the kitchen.

Welcome to Pine Ridge, gateway to beautiful hikes, small town coffee shops and there might be angels in the woods. Great and terrible angels.


Welcome to Pine Ridge: The Wooden Bones.

Welcome to Pine Ridge, far off the map and a thirty minute drive away from anywhere real. We truly have it all, coffee shops with small town charm and enchanting views so beautiful you may never leave. 

I took a drive out to Tumwater the other day, not a place we normally go since it's a three hour drive but I had an appointment. Looking around at Tumwater makes the Ridge feel so much different. It's like you cross a line somewhere and the world feels different. Like how Tumwater doesn't have the wooden bones.

We have burn bans in the summer and the only ones allowed to violate that are the fire department themselves. It's so nice of them to fill the air with ash while we have every window open in a vain attempt to escape the heat. 

However, after the first leaf falls and summer comes to its end, you'll start to notice deep in the burn-etched forest, trees lying oddly in the grass. Laying on their sides, an almost aligned group of branches reaching up to the sky and all bending the same direction. Something about the way they do this and the way it turns white once the rain washed the black bark away always makes me think of bone. 

It's like some unknowable beast laid down for a nap and simply never got back up. Not all look that peaceful, some you can see the upturned root system of the stump and with the finer roots gone; it's almost like an open maw. Permanently burned open and screaming.

With autumn upon us, the rain has washed away any risk of a wildfire and the controlled burns have come to their end. Which is great for us since the furnace is currently broken. No AC, no heater and our local HVAC has no interest in fixing our current furnace, only on selling us a new one. It's still too hot for me to sleep at night, normally I would have the AC on low to give my room a good breeze and make it easy to sleep. With the AC broken though, my only option is having my window open at night. It was fine for the first few nights but then I woke up one night in a sweat and with the odd feeling something was close. My entire body on edge, I sat there and listened. 

Silence.
Pure and complete silence.

It was as though the wind had completely stopped. Everything had stopped; no wind, no frogs croaking in fields, nothing outside made a single noise. The longer I sat there the heavier the silence became until I heard just outside my window the sound of shuffling feet in the gravel.

All at once the spell was broken, I took off like a shot to the living room. My brother and cousin were still having coffee as the clock neared 12; they are both the type to have coffee late at night and still sleep soundly. 

“There's someone outside.”

“What?” My cousin asked while my brother quickly rushed over to the closet.

“I heard shuffling outside my window. There's someone outside.” I reiterate while my brother passed my cousin a hunting rifle. 

Hunting rifles and flash lights in hand, they went to check what I had heard only to find nothing. The gravel didn't even look disturbed and so we had to assume that it was just one of the cats from the small feral colony that lives on our property. 

I closed my window that night. I suffered the discomfort of the heat and nestled myself deep into my blankets as though they were a shield keeping the dark at bay. I didn't open my window the next night or the next. 

I found that the bathroom window was close enough that I could open it and receive some relief. I kept opening the bathroom window before laying down but on the nights I'd forget, I'd listen extra close after opening it. I could see the shape of the trees whipping in the wind but the wind was quiet.

I wasn't sleeping very well after all of that. The heat in the house was getting to me and I couldn't do it anymore. I started opening my window again. I wake up in the night a lot but after the first time, I started listening every time I woke up. Listening for just a moment to hear, often being greeted by silence but often if I listened I would hear the wind start up again. The noise would return and I would fall asleep again.

The hunting rifles are for the coyotes by the way, I know some people have opinions about guns but when you're this far out, you can't afford to be caught off guard. The coyotes don't get close to the house, but we're prepared just in case. 

You never realize how small coyotes really are until one night you see one standing in the backyard, stock still on its hind legs. I have no idea if it was staring at me because it heard me coming or if it was looking inside the house for some reason. I minded my business though, forest animals don't like to be stared at, and it lowered its head and walked off into the night. After it turned I'll admit I looked it over, I think I was a bit too tired that night though; the fur almost looked like splintered wood.

I saw the coyote in the yard shortly before I finally closed my window for good. It was the dead of night and I had been listening to junk on my phone so I didn't focus too much on the window. I finally dozed off only to wake up an hour later to stagnant air filling every corner of my room. 

“Must have forgot to open it tonight.” I told myself as I pulled my sweaty body out of bed and checked the window. 

I usually like to check the window without opening the curtains, the way I do this is simply by reaching through the curtain to feel for the mesh screen or glass. I reached into the fabric and as my hand reached forward passing where the glass should be, I heard nothing. My hand suddenly collided with the screen for just a moment, I felt something push back as something on the other side breathed out warm, stagnant air.

A jolt ran through my body as I pulled my hand back and did the only thing I could think to do; I slammed and locked the window. Shaking I threw myself back under my covers, fumbling to put something on to distract my shaken mind. After a few minutes rational thought started to take over.

“I'm just tired, I was probably half asleep. There's nothing out there.” I repeated in my mind until sleep took over. When I woke up, we found no evidence of anything outside my window again but I put a wooden rod in the tracks of my window just to feel a bit more at ease about the whole thing. The next night we could hear the coyotes outside again, they were very active, howling the night away.

The fire department did an out of season controlled burn after that, and driving by on my way to Tumwater, I couldn't help but notice the roaring, open maws of the root systems.  We did manage to find the burnt out fuse in the furnace and have ordered the part to fix the furnace, which is just in time since winter without a heater would be difficult. Either way, if you decide to visit us you might just want to stay the night and if you do, I recommend closing your windows if the night air is too warm. 

Welcome to Pine Ridge, home to any number of majestic animals, from elk to black tail deer, and if you see anything strange standing on two legs with splintering wood instead of fur, I recommend you mind your own business.


Welcome to Pine Ridge: Don't mind the cameras.

Welcome to Pine Ridge, friend to small businesses and home to a half dozen free range homesteads. Small businesses sprinkle just about every main road, ready to help any traveler that might drive through on their way to the next breathtaking vista. Not many shops in town are open 24/7, people would rather employees get to spend time with family and friends. Nevertheless, rest assured when your car breaks down the auto-shop down the road is open and selling jumper cables.

My brother, Hunter, used to work at the only 24 hour business in the whole of Pine Ridge, the auto-shop. He never worked the night shift at the owners insistence and never fought him on it. He would come in to perfectly stocked shelves, clean floors, and not a smudge of dirt on the windows. 

“I think the owner just likes the quiet, so he takes the night shift.” He would say when describing the shop, he'd give a shrug and go on about his day.

The owner had a number of rules, some more flexible than others, he didn't care if you spent an extra minute on your phone in the restroom but you can't move the old cardboard cut out from his favorite car movie. Apparently that's how the last guy got fired. The strangest rule was about the CCTV cameras; the whole shop was wired with cameras but when you went in the back, the cameras were off with a note over the power button.

“Leave OFF!! At ALL times!!” 

They had a break in and the owner called in panicking.

“Do not watch the tape back! Just pass the police the tape for that day and leave the monitor off.”

“Sir, I don't see the-”

“Just let the police handle it and go home. I'll be there in a few minutes to take over.”

“Alright, I'll hang out the sign and lock up-”

“Don't bother. I'm already on the way. Just go home.”

It was possibly one of the only times Hunter talked about his day after work.

“If the monitor is broken he should just get it fixed or unplug it. It's better than an electrical fire possibly burning the place down.” He commented but never really went much deeper. 

He's a stoic kind of man like that, the auto-shop was perfect for him since he mostly just had to stand there and know about cars. Both things Hunter was good at but all things come to their end and after I started writing all this down, I realized he had never said why he quit. One day he just walked in, sat down and said “I think I'm doing something else. I don't think I want to be there the rest of my life.” 

I went into the workshop the other day and asked him why. What made him quit. Drawing in a long steady breath he heaved a heavy sigh.

“The cameras. You don't turn on the cameras.” He looked on at the wall, the bleak acceptance of life washed over him and he began to explain.

Mister Park was a good man to work under, easy going, soft spoken and quick with a joke. Rules weren't really rules, more guidelines. If you follow the spirit of the rules then you're within the rules, the only rule he was strict about was the cameras. 

“It was the only thing he would actually get angry about. So I never told him when I broke it.”

Hunter would be working either early in the morning or late in the day when he would need to get something out of the back. No one would be in the shop, he would pop into the back and turn the cameras on so he could watch the front while working. Of course, no one would come in but he could grab a glance, see nothing and move on with his work.

A simple, easy system. Until one day he walked passed and, in stealing a glance at the front lobby, noticed a customer. A woman busily exchanging niceties with the store clerk. Hunter was already at the front counter. He watched the grainy visage pass the woman a fuse in exchange for a few dollars, the woman left and Hunter turned, looking into the cameras. 

“I think it was probably a playback error, playing some other day or time instead. The thing that bothered me is, I never looked at the cameras in that place.” 

I think most people would have ran but Hunter isn't most people. He grabbed a good chunk of pipe meant for linking the exhaust system to a muffler and charged up to the front. Only to be greeted by an empty shop. Going into the back he found the cameras were already off with the note placed slightly higher on the screen. He didn't leave when his shift ended either, he clocked out and waited for the owner to come in. When the owner did come by it was after he fell asleep waiting. Looking around to see the store perfectly managed and stocked he asked if the owner had just gotten there.

“Yeah, just pulled up a moment ago.” He smiled with a twinge of concern “Why are you sleeping here son?”

“Sir, why are the cameras always off?”

Mister Park's smile fell. “You turned them on, didn't you?” 

Hunter nodded.

“You saw it, right?” 

Hunter once again nodded to confirm and Mister Park silently replied by rubbing at his brow. Mister Park pulled up a chair and sat for a moment.

“This place is a bit odd, I run a skeleton crew because of it. There's nothing bad here but nothing right either. I don't come in every night because a part of me never truly leaves, I've already been here and part of me always will be there in those cameras.” He stated in an almost nostalgic tone but his eyes looked guilty.

“I don't know if it's the cameras or the place but I figured it's better if you just don't know. Some people have worked here through the years and didn't stay so I guess they followed the rules. You always leave a part of yourself here, Hunter. You'll always be here with me. What you do with the rest of yourself is up to you.”

Hunter sat there staring at the wooden key chain he had been craving before I stepped in, rubbing at the smoothed wood as he thought it over. He hadn’t met my eyes since we started talking.


“I don’t know what part of me I left back there but when I walked out I saw it. I rounded the corner to greet Mr. Park.” 

And he was right. I took a drive down to the auto shop for some oil and there he was, my brother, still tending the counter. It's odd exchanging greetings with a man you know is sitting in the car outside. I can't say what part of him he left there but I think it has his smile.

I don't know how much more of this I'm going to write, since I started the baby crying in the wetlands has been getting louder and I'm thinking if I stop, it'll calm down.

Welcome to Pine Ridge, home to some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet and maybe some day you'll stay too.

1n3nygq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BariatricSurgery/comments/1n3nygq/preop_adopt_day_3/,Pre-op adopt (day 3),"I’m just finishing my 3rd day of the pre-op diet. 27 more to go. 

I figured I’d share my experience so far for anyone else who might be worried about it.

A couple facts. 

1. My diet is just water and 4 Optifast “shakes” per day. Nothing else. My surgeon doesn’t allow broth or jello like some programs. But DOES allow sugar free/calorie free flavour enhancers. And let me tell you, those make all the difference. 

2 optifast was fully sold out of the chocolate, so I was only able to buy the vanilla for the full 30 days. 

3. The vanilla flavour is very very sweet and very very vanilla, and a little bit like chalk. But just a little. After my first one I knew that it wasn’t bad, but would get old REALLY fast. 

4. When I stepped on the scale this morning (after 2 days) I had already lost 7 lbs!!! That was crazy and super motivating. 

5. Im rarely hungry to be honest. But I’m drinking a LOT! On top of my shakes, I’ve had 3 32oz bottles of water today. So I’m also peeing a ton. 

6. Honestly? Maybe it’s naive but after 3 days I’m not at all worried about the next 27. It’s been pretty not bad so far. 

7. Worst part was going to my inlaws’ apartment yesterday and smelling all their cooking, but even then I was still fine. 

8. Matteo’s zero Cal coffee syrups are LIFE SAVERS! I got Mocha, Peanut Butter Cup, and Pumpkin Praline. Those totally save you on the flavor of the optifast. 

9. I got this! Yeah there will be hard moments. But if I can get through the first 3 days without  any real issues, and if that scale keeps dropping (it’ll slow down, I know) this is totally doable guys! I’m not even worried anymore. 

Thanks everyone on this sub for being so awesome and all the advice you share. I love this community!

If you’re reading this, what’s done is done. I’m sorry for everything they say I did. I know that my apologies will never make up for my actions, but it’s all I have left to offer. 

By now, the news has undoubtedly painted me as a blood thirsty psychopath, but know that I had a good reason for everything. It filled me with immense dread and pain, but for the sake of us all, I had to do it. 

Sarah’s Parents: I know you’ll never forgive me. I don’t expect you to. Losing your daughter must have been heartbreaking, let alone the grandkids. The paperwork and instructions for all of our assets are in the top drawer of the armoire. I have a lawyer on standby to liquidate anything you don’t want to provide financial assistance for the both of you. I know it’ll never replace what you lost, but it should relieve that aspect of grief. The photo albums are in the top of the closet. You know Sarah loved to scrapbook so any memory you could want should be there. Just know that what I did was not malicious. I did it out of necessity. 

Hilldale Police Department and any other investigators involved: Everything past this point can be considered my confession. I understand if this document cannot be accepted as of sound mind and body so I have also dictated this to my lawyer and he has a notarized copy that should match up. There is no reason for the investigation to continue. My in-laws have no need to be harassed with questions. Let the case close and let them bury their loved ones. 

Monday 7 July

I was awoken from a nightmare filled with gore and violence. At the foot of my bed sat my two children, John (6) and Sally (9). I got out of bed, got them water and put them back to bed. On my way back to my room, I slipped on the floor and hit my head. While in my daze, I was met by a dark figure that handed me a book and explained that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I got myself up and returned to bed. That morning, on my desk at work, sat the same book. Its dark brown leather bindings were unmistakable. The pages were brittle and yellowed with age. As I turned to the first I was hit with an odor of decay and sulphur. The book began “I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals.” I quickly closed it, immediately recognizing its origin. The book went into my bag and I attempted to finish my day. 

That night, I was blessed with another nightmare. In this one the dark figure spoke to me. What I assume were its eyes stared into mine and in a dark ethereal voice it said “2. 23.” Then I awoke. I scrambled for the book. Inside I turned to chapter 2, page 23 and saw what had to be done. I woke Sarah, told her I had gotten a call from work, and left to begin my preparations. 

When I returned later that day, I called everyone into the family room. They sat on the couch and I stood before them with an air of defeat. “Daddy has to do bad things. Don’t worry, everyone will be okay. Trust me.” Sally and John seemed frightened but assured by my fake confidence. Sarah had a look of quiet disgust and fear. She shoved it down to embrace our children. That evening we had a long discussion where I explained to her my visions and I showed her the book. After some argument and hushed yelling she decided that I should seek mental help and gave me a number to call. Instead I went to the priest. After explaining to him what I felt were the important details, he reassured me that a higher power had a plan for me and my family. His words, undoubtedly meant to be comforting, only cemented in my head what I had to do. I went home that night and prepared for the worst. 

Before I go on, I’m sorry. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I’m no one special. Sure I had my dreams and aspirations but then I got married and had kids. I was a normal suburban man with a normal job. I don’t know why I did what I did, except that I had to. That part was clear. 

Wednesday 9 July

I started with Sally. She had always been meek and soft spoken so I knew she wouldn’t put up much of a fight. She was still asleep in her bed, so I stood in her doorway and watched her sleep. My little angel. After two long years of trying and trying, she surprised us as a welcome Christmas gift. That tiny pink blanket made it so that September would never be the same. When we brought her home she was no bigger than my forearm. The long nights and endless diapers formed the princess that slept so peacefully wrapped in her big kid blanket that we got her when she went to kindergarten. That long beautiful brown hair that her mother meticulously brushed every morning became a dark mess as my hammer connected with the cowlick. Strike after strike with such fury that my face quickly became painted by the tiny red drops of matter that escaped. She didn’t even have a chance to fight. Before either of us knew what happened, she had lost all grip on her teddy bear and slumped into her mattress. I wiped the tears and blood from my face and moved down the hallway. 

As I stood outside John’s door, collecting my breath and calming my quivering emotions, I heard some motion inside. I cracked the door, silhouetting myself with the hallway light. “Daddy, what’s going on?” A tiny voice emerged from the shadows. 

“It’s okay buddy, just lay back down.”  He relaxed back into his pillow as I closed the door behind me. I was already making too much noise so I had to change my approach. Next to his bed was a stuffed stegosaurus that he got for his birthday. We had visited the Utah museum of natural history and it ignited a love of dinosaurs. He had fallen in love with the giant skeleton on display and when they had the stuffy in the gift shop it was a no brainer. He carried that thing home and didn’t let go of it for days. Steggy ate dinner with us, he went on car rides, and he even escorted John to the bathroom during potty training. The love that he had for these prehistoric giants surpassed that of any cartoon or even graham crackers. The plush fake scale texture added a level of grip that allowed it to easily be used to snuff out his young life. As he squirmed under my weight, I could hear him trying to struggle and plead. As he continued yelling “Daddy! Daddy please!” I couldn’t help but break down. When his tiny appendages relaxed and gave in the only sound left was my sobs. I sat on the bed next to him and stroked his hair. I cried so loud that I woke up my wife. 

I raised my head to walk out and Sarah’s eyes met mine in the doorway. The shock and horror on her face ignited a rage in me that I’ve never felt before. She knew what I was doing. She knew why I was doing it. She wasn’t supposed to be involved and now she stood there judging me. I lunged at her and pinned her to the ground. Blow after blow my balled fists connected with her face until it became an unrecognizable pile of hamburger. When she quit fighting, I stood up and cleaned the blood off my hands. As I looked at the bruises and developing defensive wounds from her perfectly manicured nails, I had a realization sweep over me. The things I had done were all in service of a mission, but Sarah was innocent. After cleaning myself to a point of acceptability I ran. 

I hopped in the car and wound up at my dad’s. I walked in as he was finishing his cup of coffee before continuing with his morning routine. My physical condition understandably shocked him and he brought me inside. After assuring him that I was fine I broke down in tears and explained the whole ordeal. He was dumbfounded. The first thing he did was call the police, report the crime at my house, and then he came to me and started working over a strategy. As an old defense attorney himself, he connected me with one of his old colleagues who rushed to the house expecting a bourbon and cigar on the porch. When he arrived my dad paid him and he went to work recording this information and arranging my documents. As he left, my father ushered me upstairs and got me into a shower. Once I was cleaned and changed, he urged me to step into the guest room where I am now writing this letter from. 

I don’t know if I can say it enough, but I am sorry. I only did what I had to. I love my family. I will undoubtedly pay for my actions, but I rest easy knowing that I have lived my life and performed all actions according to his plan and his will. 

Dad: I apologize for the mess. I know you’ll find this letter before the police do, but please return it to where you found it and let them do their work. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Know that you had no part in this. I love you and I always have. I’m sorry for everything. 

This letter was found near the body of Mr. Caleb Whitmore following a Hilldale Police response to a shots fired call from outside the home. The individual was located in the guest room of his father’s house surrounded by photos of his children and wife, who were discovered earlier that day massacred in their home. Mr. Whitmore apparently suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Following an in depth investigation by the Utah Bureau of Investigations, the community continues to reel in the wake of this indescribable tragedy.

I know they were born in Alabama, seems pretty certain that it's Covington County in 1885ish for her and Coffee County in 1876ish for him. Ancestry seems to think they found him in the 1880 census with a mother named Lidia in Butler County, but I'm finding it impossible to find any records between 1880 and 1903 when William got married to confirm. I can't find a death record for Lidia, and I can't find a birth record for Betty. They aren't listed in anything I can find in the Full-Text Search feature in FamilySearch, and I can't seem to find them in the 1900 census. I know it's pretty common to lose records this far back, and I'm not sure when they moved to Florida (Walton/Okaloosa County area)--just that he at least was there by 1903, and she was there by 1910. We don't have any family records like bibles or anything that give any information, and apparently Granny Betty kept her mouth SHUT about her early life. Any insights into where I might look next? Any other resources I might try? I know it's a longshot and that records are sparse for someone so far back in such a rural area, but I've seen some people in this community with some skills break through some solid walls. Thanks in advance!

ETA: Swiney is the maiden name, so it's William Henry's name too. Thanks!",1,1756513746.0,Genealogy,0,1.0,False

“Unfortunately son, you’ll never walk again.”

I’ll never forget those words. My mom cried, my dad left with the doctor. When I got in my buddy’s car, we thought we were bulletproof. Maybe we were, but we weren’t telephone pole proof. The next 6 months were a blur of physical therapy and prayer. I didn’t even know we belonged to a church, all of a sudden we’re in the front row and people are walking around my new chair to take communion. It all felt so forced. Maybe that’s why we stopped going as soon as the PT confirmed what the doctor had cursed me with. 

It’s surprisingly easy to learn how to be differently abled. The looks and fake pity wore off after the first week. The handicap placard came in the mail the same day as the hospital bill. By the time I got to college, I was used to asking for accommodations. As I rolled across the stage, I could see a future of elevators and aisle seats sprawled out before me. I placed the framed degree on my wall as the mail fell through the door. On top was a non-descript letter with no return address that caught my attention. 

YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED

The big bold letters on the front signed this letter's ticket to the junk pile. After sorting everything, I went back to my day. Everytime I passed my credenza though, that letter caught my eye. I knew it was just a credit card scam or a personal loan, but there was something about it. Eventually I gave in and took it to my office. Picking up my letter opener I was weirdly anxious. This was a piece of mail. What did I even have to be anxious about? News headlines popped in my head: “Local idiot falls victim to mail bomb,” “The Unibomber strikes from the grave,” “Are the handicapped more susceptible to anthrax: results may shock you.”
Inside the envelope wasn’t nearly that exciting. 

It contained a piece of paper with an address and a phone number. The address was some field in the middle of nowhere Tennessee and the phone number went to an automated line. A very chipper, albeit obviously recorded, voice picked up with pretty standard fare. “Congratulations. You have been selected as a candidate for our brand new program.” Obviously a scam. “Please prepare to record the details of our offer!”

Then the voice changed. Now it’s a very robotic AI type. The tone didn’t’t matter. The voice could’ve been anything when it said my name. Then the recording came back to ask me to confirm. When I did, the robot returned. 
“You are now suffering from paralysis. Would you like to regain your life?”

I didn’t know what to say. What was this? It had to be some kind of joke. After a moment with no response, it came back, “Joseph, do you want your legs back? Yes or no?”

I responded with a half hearted, shaky yes and the only response I got was “two days.” Then the line went silent. Thoughts escaped me. I considered calling my mom, but she’d never believe me. My dad would get confused and accuse me of falling for a scam. All that I had was to wait and see what happened to me. 

Two days later, I woke up just as I had for years. Pulled my legs out of bed. Moved into my chair. Got ready for the day. Went into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Made my way to the office and saw another envelope on the floor. This one was blank. Same size, same shape, same everything minus the writing. I scooped it up and noticed some weight. When I got it open, there was a plane ticket with my name on it. No other information. No airline, destination, departure gate, nothing. There was my name, today’s date, and a weird seal that I’ve never seen. To put it into words, an octopus with wings. Something about it felt sinister, but I threw the papers in the trash.

I was google searching scams involving travel, medical issues, weird marine-biologists. Really anything that could help me figure it out. This was interrupted by a car horn. I made my way to the door and outside stood a blacked-out Cadillac. I assumed it must be my neighbor’s until someone got out and started walking to my door. I backed away in time for the door to open and the man made eye contact with me. 

“Mr. Tuttle?” I sat in silence. “I will be your escort for the duration of your travel. Please follow me.” And he walked out just as swiftly as he came in. I don’t know why, but I followed him. He opened the back door and gave me a hand getting settled. He folded my chair and placed it in the back. I closed my door and away we went. 

We drove for what felt like hours. The entire time, I couldn’t get stories of abductions and the countless missing posters I had seen pasted all over town out of my head. Was I being abducted? Does this count as an abduction? I did go willingly. This man was being nothing but cordial so far. Aren’t kidnappers supposed to be gruff and rude? The silence was broken as we slowed for a turn. 

“Do you have your ticket?” 

“I’m sorry, what?”

“The ticket you received. Did you bring it?”

“No, I think it’s on my desk.”

“No worries. We’ll get you one sorted.” Then he tossed my passport into the seat beside me. I was working up the courage to ask who he was or how he got it when we came to a stop. 

I’m by no means an aviation expert, but I did go through a phase as a kid. When I say this was the most beautiful, wellkept Cessna Citation Jet I’d ever seen, I mean it. Granted, I didn’t have a ton of experience in private jets. But none of that mattered. The driver opened my door and I was met with a flight attendant type that had my chair ready to go and a ramp that was almost certainly special made. I rolled right up into the plane and made myself comfortable. She came over and gave me a brief safety run down and asked if I was comfortable. 

“Mr. Straker informed us that you would require certain accommodations and we are here to provide. Just say the word.”
She then placed a drink in front of me and disappeared to the rear. I hesitantly took a sip and found the drink to be quite pleasant. Somehow they had perfectly captured the taste of peanuts in a coke and poured it into my glass. After that sip didn’t make my mouth tingly or make me throw up, I quite enjoyed it. As we escaped the ground, I felt a heaviness come over my body. 

When I woke up, the flight attendant was taking my trash as we prepared to descend. I asked her where we were but she just smiled and walked away. The plane lands, I make my way off and I’m greeted by my driver. Same song and dance, same Cadillac. If not for the extreme humidity change, you could convince me we never left. He pulled the car to a stop in front of an office building. That’s what I’d call it if it was anywhere else. In comparison to the huts and dilapidated buildings surrounding it, the building loomed with a dark aura. The beating sun was blotted out by its massive footprint and then reflecting off its millions of windows. The locals didn’t seem to notice. Or if they did, they didn’t point it out to me. If I was in a monster movie, lightning would be striking the peak with crows circling about. 

Inside was sterile. Glistening white marble accentuated by an onyx black desk with a rather attractive woman sitting behind it. When the door shut behind us, she looked up from her computer and came running to greet us. 

“Oh my god! It’s so nice to meet you! I’m Holly. Victor has told us so much about you. Can I get you a water?”

I was taken aback. No one yet had been this bubbly. Everyone was nice, but reserved. Holly was your stereotypical valley girl who acted like she had met a puppy. I’d be lying if I said the female attention wasn’t nice. She guided me to a seating area and for the first time there wasn’t anything special. I parked my chair next to the empty ones and waited. 

After a few minutes, I heard the comically loud creak of a door down the hallway followed by a slam that shook the empty room. As heels struck the polished floors, my anxiety returned at not knowing who I’d be meeting. The steps stopped at a door, opened it and shared some words and then another set of feet joined. This happened a couple of times until an entourage entered my view. The group of generic office types stopped, almost in sync, and parted to let the organizer through. Out of this mob of middle managers came a man that could’ve graced Forbes circa 1985. The sharp collar, gelled hair, and suspenders made this man look like he had been transported through time to be here with me today. The illusion was broken when he removed an iPhone from his pocket and silenced the ringer. 

“Ah, Mr. Tuttle. It is so nice to finally meet.”
His voice filled me with a sense of despair that was only slightly diminished by his salesman’s charisma. 

“I am Mr. Straker, but as I’m sure Holly informed you, everyone calls me Victor.”
He extended his hand for a shake and I met with hesitation. 

“We are so glad to finally have you here with us at our facility. Since our inception, we have dreamed of a day to improve someone in your situation.”

His gesture melted my walls of uncertainty, and he noticed. “Now that you’re here, let’s get you settled. Afterwards we can get you on a tour.”
I am led by my escort to the elevator. He presses the top button and we ascend. I can’t help but notice that every button except the top and lobby are locked behind a card scanner. As we reach the floor, the elevator dings and we enter into a massive room. If this were the Hilton, I’d call it the presidential suite. Except everything was at eye level. Lowered counter tops, mirrors touching the ground, even the doorknobs were lower. I went into one of the bedrooms and it even had larger spaces beside the bed for my chair. It’s almost as if this room was made for me. I was pulled out of my awe by the escort saying something. I asked him to repeat and, in a much sterner tone, he sighed, “Dinner at 6. Get ready for your tour.” And shut the door. Get ready? I hadn’t even had the chance to pack bags. I went into the bedroom and found the drawers and closet stuffed with track suits my exact measurements. There must have been two dozen. If not for everything else, I might’ve found this weird. I must admit, I was pretty hungry. I got changed into the branded suit and made my way to the elevator. The escort was there waiting for me and scanned his card to open the door as I approached. We made our way back down but not to the lobby. I didn’t catch what number he pushed but the lights indicated that we were dropping well below that. I hadn’t even noticed those buttons earlier. 

On the outside of the sliding doors was Victor. He had changed into formal garden wear and presented a much more laid back appearance. Once again I was met with a handshake and away he walked down the hallway. Instinctually I followed. As we rounded the corner to a locked door, he finally spoke. 

“Here at Straker Industries, we are the leading innovators in all things improvement. As a matter of fact, that’s where my grandfather came up with our slogan ‘We fix what he overlooked.’ Grandfather was a religious man, but he never felt that his image was the peak. So he opened our first facility.” He outstretched his hands and the doors opened for him. We stepped over the threshold and a wave of calm came over me. I expected a corporate hellscape or a doctor’s waiting room. Instead I found a museum. As Victor and I walked he recounted years of history. There was a picture of his relative with Henry Ford, a group of people outside of Tut’s Tomb, the group picture of Apollo 11, the list goes on. I couldn’t help but notice a large chunk of time missing. I had to stop him. “How did you guys make it through the Depression?”

“We simply explored some foreign endeavors that paid out when they needed to.” This was technically an answer, but not quite satisfactory. I decided to let sleeping dogs lie and we continued the tour. I had zoned off until we reached the next door. He paused and reached for the handles. “This here, is what we’re really proud of” was all he said before throwing the doors open. 

When you hear stories of Neverland ranch or Suddam’s palace, the first thing people talk about are the zoos. I have heard so many stories about the tigers and the monkeys and whatever else they could get their hands on. Those did not prepare me for what was behind that hatch. The first window we passed was not dissimilar to a primate cage at the zoo. These apes could not be happy. The constant yelling and screaming was deafening. Victor yelled something over the noise but I couldn’t break my attention away from the smallest one. 

Standing about 3.5 feet tall, he was hunched over a children’s toy. As the only one not screaming, I shared his focus with the task at hand. As he sorted small blocks into the proper holes, I was amazed. This level of intellectualism is what I was told separated us from the monkeys. He must have noticed I was looking. As his eyes met mine, I was filled with sadness. The eyes looked human. I could tell he was scared. He wanted out, to see the world. Only then did I notice the patches of hair. All over the small frame, there were patches of black wiry hair. Not like it had lost hair, but like it had grown new. Then I noticed the shape of the face. It wasn’t elongated, more circular. Then I saw the limbs. As I started to put together what I had seen, Mr. Straker re-entered my consciousness. “Alopecia. Doesn’t matter how many of them we get, they can’t grow hair right.” Away we walked. Nothing more. As we entered the next set of doors, the screams subsided, except one. If you’d told me there was a child screaming for its mother, you would’ve described the sound that stood my hair on edge. 

The trap between doors came with a rush of air and an unlocking. This time there was no enclosure. The room was empty except for a figure in the corner. Victor's voice got low and he started to creep. “This next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” Before I had time to process what he had said, the figure's head snaps around and I hear the rattle of an iron chain as it stands up to meet our gaze. As the creature fully unfolded, I felt a deep resentment for the curse of creation. Its bare appearance left no gory detail to the imagination. From the shadow, I witnessed the silhouette of two legs, then three, then four. None the same size as the other. Then the torso, wider than any man, gave way to a matching number of arms. At the apex of this mass of natural crime was a keg of what I could only call a head. The thing stumbled into the light and it somehow got worse. Down the center of this creature was a seam. Something, or someone, fused these beings. These people. The eyes shot a look at mine of pain and suffering. With labored breathing and out of sync blinking, the being attempted to speak. The garbled mess of spit and grunts was interrupted by Mr. Straker cutting in with something about organ health and donation. I focused in on the being and reached out to touch it. As I did, the escort grabbed my chair. I hadn’t even realized he was there. I was wheeled out of the room, but I could swear it worked out a “save” between groans and sputters. Those eyes. I’ll never forget those eyes. 

As the door shut behind me, Straker wiped his hands with a handkerchief and let out a sigh. “Well, wasn’t that something? Now that you have seen our successes, we hope that you can begin to understand the importance of our work and your part to play.”

“I can’t say that I do understand where I fit into all of this.”

“Well.” He seemed flustered. “Nothing we can’t fix with dinner.” He clapped his hands together and took off down the hallway. I followed into a glorious dining room. The art on the wall alone made this a rival to the ballrooms of Versailles. At the center was a rather intimate table with two settings. I had assumed I would be eating with Victor, but at the head of the table was Holly. She had transformed from her valley girl, business casual appearance in the lobby to a woman befitting James Bond. The slit in her dress went almost as high as the top went low. Her yellow bun had become golden locks that danced around her delicate shoulders. The hands that had been clicking away at her computer now had elegantly manicured nails and looked to be unspoiled by the hardships of life. As she stood to greet me, I almost did the same. 

We enjoyed the many spoils that came with endless funds. The steaks, the caviar, everything was perfect. They brought out a tiramisu that rivaled the ambrosia of Olympus. And the wine. From a Riesling that was lost during the Second World War to a Heisdeck Champagne from the Titanic. Everything was perfect. Afterwards, Holly and I spent time chatting about the art and what life was like with Straker. As the night continued, so did the wine. Then brandy. Then more wine. After a couple of hours, I had found a friend in the least likely of places. We head to the elevator, she scans her card, and follows me into the capsule. The door to my room opens, and we stroll into my new abode. She tells me that she’ll meet me in the next room and heads to grab more wine. I move towards the door and that’s as much as I remember. 

The next morning, all of the blood has returned to my head with a vengeance. I’ve had my party nights, but nothing had hit me this hard. The window allows a beam of heat into my world, blistering my sensitive corneas. I make my way to the bathroom and immediately reminded myself of what made me feel this way. After I clean myself up, I go to get dressed in today’s track suit and I find a glass of water, two unassuming pills, and a note. “Thought you might need these. -H.” She really must care. As I approach the elevator, the door opens and I meet the escort again. “Mr. Straker expresses his regret that he could not meet you this morning.” I was in no mood for conversation so I let out a groan and down we go. This time to floor 9. The elevator stops but the doors do not open. Instead the escort stands there with a physical key inserted, staring at a red light. As the light turns green, he twists the key and the room is filled with blinding light. Out of the brightness steps a silhouette with outstretched arms. 

“Welcome. Are you ready?” I rubbed my eyes and Victor came into focus. He took my hand and gave it a vigorous shake. “Are you ready, my boy? This is where we make wishes come true.” He leads me into what I at first thought was a hospital. People standing in groups, wearing scrubs and face shields. Everyone had a table on which they were vehemently focused. The only clue to what was so interesting was the occasional tool request and leaking mystery fluid. As we passed through the decon chamber and I was fitted with my own mask, I got a better look. On every table was a torso. These people looked to be medical students doing a cadaver lab, but they were still bleeding. The back side of the room had a locked door full of muffled noises. I inquired about the source and was brushed off. As we continued moving forward, I was told something about scientific advancement and the study of the human form. My focus was divided between trying to listen to what was being said and that room. One of the larger strangers takes a bag full of the remains of one of the tables and heads towards the door. As he opens it, I catch a glimpse of a man in a coat with a saw and the noise became screams for half a second. Shortly after we exit the room. The escort helps me onto a table of my own and I refuse to lay down. Victor comes around into frame, now wearing his own scrubs, and begins to explain my procedure. 

“What we have found is that the best way to cure bad blood is to replace it. In your case, we believe your legs are full of the stuff.” He pointed to an MRI on the board. “Here and here are your problem areas. As our research has found, the best procedure for someone like you is the full replacement of the host limb…” he continued speaking but I zoned out. In my distracted state, the escort grabbed my forehead and forced me down. I felt the straps close on my head and arms. I began to struggle as much as I could muster as an unknown member walked to my side with a syringe. I tried to scream but the mask over my face tightens. 

“I’m sorry Joseph. This part is the least fortunate. Rest assured, much like work, pain will set you free.” Then I was out. 

In the darkness, I was filled with nightmares. I was in the woods. I was running. Behind me was a pack of dogs. As I ran they continued getting closer. Every step I took, the hunt grew shorter. I could smell their breath and feel the drool dripping off of their jowls. As they pounced on me, I stared into the alpha's eyes. The view was familiar. The wolves did not rip me apart. Instead they chewed. They chewed and chewed as the alpha stared into my eyes. Those eyes. They were filled with so much sorrow. 

I woke up to a new sight. The lights were softer and the nurse was kinder. She offered me a glass of water and helped me sit up to drink it. When I needed the facilities, she was there to help me up. I threw back the blankets and let out a scream. Where my useless noodles of muscle and bone used to be were now two lumps of flesh I didn’t recognize that were pale in color and completed with dirty stitches. The fear that coursed through my blood was quickly rushed away when I noticed the pain. 

My legs burned with the heat of infection, but they hurt. I hadn’t felt my legs hurt in years. My toes moved. The nurse helped me to my feet and I stumbled to the restroom. I walked to the bathroom. He had done it. That mad man had cured my paralysis. If only he’d stopped there. 
The next days were filled with me relearning how to walk. Like a baby I stumbled along hand rails and then toddled my way across the room. Before I knew it, the accident had never happened. As my life force reinvigorated the cold chunks that had been fused at my thigh, I was returning to normal. The nights were filled with tears. Happy at first, and then painful. The doctors said I was building muscle, but something didn’t feel right. Call it intuition, but I would swear my body was rejecting my attempt to defy nature. 

After 3 weeks, I returned to my suite and prepared to leave. Victor met me in my room and seemed to be helping me pack. We talked of plans for the future and what to do with my new gift. I thanked him vigorously, leaving out the growing fear of what was to come. Then I collapsed. My forehead covered in sweat and my vision blurring, the infection had taken over. Mr. Straker ran to my side and began evaluating my condition. “This is okay. We’ve had this before. We can fix this.” Th escort arrives with a gurney and I am rushed back downstairs. This time through a different room. Every spare inch of this new corridor was covered in beds. People screamed. The faces almost seemed familiar but my pain kept me from drawing too many connections. Every single person writhed in their straps and begged for death. I noticed they too had the discolorations in assorted limbs. Had they done this before?

Back in the operating room, the attendants ran around in a flurry. Tables and coolers were rushed in. People scrubbed and swapped. I was attached to a monitor with an uneven beeping. Someone said something about failure. This was it. I wasn’t going to make it off of here. Then the darkness again. This time I awoke to another bright light. 

This light, not blinding, was welcoming. Soft, warm, but bright. As my eyes adjusted, I scanned the room for a familiar face. Victor was pacing in the corner. When we locked gazes he rushed to my side. “Ah, my boy. Guten Morgen. Welcome back. We feared we had almost lost you. Unfortunately, due to a slight oversight, you had contracted an infection that was overtaking your systems. Not to worry, we were able to clean you out.”

 I checked my legs and they remained unchanged. The pale skin remained attached by crude lines and a growing scar. I reached out to feel the inflated incision area when I noticed my hand was not my own. The shock caused me to jump. “Unfortunately it had spread and more of your blood had soured. We made the decision to fix that for you. Worry not, we would never dare lose our most valuable subject to date.”

Subject? I knew this place wasn’t a hospital, but why had I gone from guest to subject? The questions filled my head and made me dizzy. Straker broke me out of my stupor. 

“Unfortunately you are not out of the woods yet. We do have more operations scheduled for you, but first you must rest.” He pushed a syringe that I had not previously noticed into my IV and I was once again gone. 

What I assume was the next morning, I woke in a haze. This time my bedside was blessed with a light of hope. Holly was there holding my remaining hand and praying. I interrupted her and she wiped tears away from her eyes. “When I heard about the infection I was so worried. I thought we had lost you. I didn’t know if I could handle that again.” I gripped her hand tighter and felt a calm come over me. We talked for a few hours about this and that. For a moment I forgot where I was. This place couldn’t be that bad if someone like this was here. Her perfectly sculpted lips pressed against my forehead and she left the room. She was replaced by the escort who helped me out of bed and down the hall. We entered a conference room and Victor sat at the head of the table. 

“Young Joseph, I fear that I have failed to explain exactly what it is we do here. We are in the business of improving life. For years, I was told stories of the beauty of creation and all that god had bestowed life upon. It never felt complete. When I broke free from the clutches of my mother, I was welcomed in by my grandfather. He brought me here. I was not the only one that shared my beliefs. He, and many generations before him, had felt the same way. He brought me here to join the business of improving intelligent design.” Then a curtain opened to reveal an operating theatre. He stood and stared through it. I watched as a screaming woman was brought into the room, tied to a gurney. “We had tried everything. Selective breeding, genetic mutation, etc. Nothing we did could fix the insufficiency in his ultimate design. Then we discovered that the issue wasn’t in the production, but in the existence.” As I watched in horror the woman’s bed was raised and she was dumped into a vat of unknown fluid. As she wriggled and squirmed against her restraints, I caught her screams. The skin on her face began to boil and peel. Before long she began developing boils and blisters. As they popped, more and more of her muscle was exposed. When the muscle would blister it would expose bone. Before long, she had fully dissolved and was nothing but a biology class decoration.

 “Of course some are less keen to the advancement of the species.” He turned away from the glass and the curtain closed. “That is why we were so excited to hear of you. When we heard of your tragic accident, I realized where we had failed. Volunteers focused on vanity; you, dear Joseph, were focused on survival. Yes life had adapted to your situation, but why not relive life to the fullest? When you accepted our invitation, I began preparations.” 

He walked along the table to meet me and took me by the hand. Together we walked through the doors and into yet another sterile room. 

“We began sourcing the very best of specimens from our volunteer pool.” We had returned to the area that I was rushed through before. Now that I had time to pay attention, the place was horrifying. On all sides, people lay in various states of consciousness as others with power tools poked and prodded. The deafening screams were only beaten by the unholy smell that perforated every inch of this place. I watched as a man, fully conscious, writhed against the knife of a surgeon. In one hand he held the flap of skin, with the other he removed organ after organ. The man fought as much as he could but the orderlies and restraints made his efforts futile. Eventually the shock and blood loss sent him into the all too familiar darkness and the screaming stopped. 

Well, his did. It was immediately replaced with the symphony of pain that surrounded me. Limbs were removed, eyes were popped from their socket, teeth were extracted, all without an inkling of the kindness that was afforded to me via the mystery syringe. As I continue the trudge through the puddles of the volunteers, we entered the operating room that I remembered all too well. Victor guided me to the table and in my stupor I didn’t even fight. He laid me back and affixed my straps. This time I noticed that he also strapped my legs. 

“Now let’s get this settled once and for all.” 
I don’t know if I had angered Mr. Straker or if I was simply becoming too expensive, but this time he decided to forego the anesthetic. As I lay there facing the ceiling, I hear a saw blade spin up not inches from my head. The nurse straps a leather strap into my mouth to muffle the screams. As the blade makes contact with my forehead I try to scream. The restraints make it impossible to fight. This is it. As it pierces through and begins working against the bone, I feel someone else begin working on my abdomen. I can feel the scalpel ripping through my stomach and I’m reminded of the man on the table. With no other option I begin to cry. As I feel his hands gripping my liver I manage to shriek past the strap. Then I black out from the pain. 

I wake up in a dark room. There’s nothing. Just darkness and something tied to my leg. I move my hand down and feel the cold steel of a new restraint. I work my hand back up and find my hideous scar is now paired with stitches and wounds all over my mangled, reformed body. My mind is running a million miles an hour when I’m blinded by the lights. As I turn away, I hear a familiar voice. 

“Now this next specimen is one that we worked years on. After many attempts, this one seems to have worked.” I stand to face the man responsible for my condition and notice a trio. Mr. Straker, the escort, and a new man. I had never met this man but he felt so familiar, perhaps I was focused on the wheelchair that led him into my prison. I begin fighting my restraint and yelling out to him. “Get out of here. Save yourself. Tell the world. They’re evil.” But nothing came out. All I could do was groan and gurgle in my spit. It was then that I noticed the pain in my throat. As I reached forward and tried to fight through my busted voice box, he reached out to me. The escort grabbed his chair and wheeled him out. As the doors closed, all I could muster out was a broken and garbled “save.”

1n3ntk4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3ntk4,"Worst Meetup Ever!!! Cringe, Pathetic and Disappointing!!!","Ghatiya, waahiyaad, pathetic, brain-rotting ""WORST MEETUP EVER""

Today you guys will know the reality of a meetup.. Our community has done like 14-15 meetups so far, and there hasn't been a single bad experience. But this Wednesday, on Aug 28th, from about 5:30ish to 6:40ish, I myself had a very bad experience (dimaag ka washing machine ban gya😵‍💫).

So what happened was wednesday ko din me 2 baje k kareeb mene dal-bati khaayi (yes this info is important, because it has dal-bati in it), dal-bati was theek-theek (Jaipur waalo ko banana nhi aata, jaante hi nhi asli dal-bati kaisi hoti he👎)

Now here starts the Story of my worst meetup experience (yet) :-

So some folks on reddit GC organized this meetup (I was absolutely unaware of this discussion in gc or wherever else they planned this marvelous meetup), It was only at 4:29 PM that I got a call from a nice redditor whom I've met before, he was the only reason why I joined these guys, because I had no idea about this meetup at all, nor did I knew who was coming. And so this redditor friend and I went to a cafe, and we both ordered some food and coffee (I ordered Zesty Orange Coffee, bhot trend kar rhi he aajkal isliye order kari, ghatiya bakwaas, diasppointing, too sweet, Orange Juice ka taste that mostly, lekin coffee pini thi merko to🙁, ""Orange Maaza"" nhi 🤡, not recommended, would not drink it again. Uske alawa V60 pour-over coffee bhi pi thi, it was good, mene basically waha sirf coffee hi pi)

So I was drinking this coffee, and we were having random chit-chat, and the person who organised this meetup was 47 minutes late, (Late pasand nhi merko, I'm only late at places jaha mujhe zyada time spend nhi karna, aur fatafat gayab hona he, jaise exam halls). Between these 47 mins. two other redditors also joined us, I didn't vibe with either of them, aur pehle to mera koi personal opinion nhi tha because I didn't at all know them, but after talking to some reliable sources (2 to be precise), unlogo k liye bhi ab mixed impressions hi he mere, not interested in meeting them again.   
And now the HOST, first of all she didn't act like a host, ekdum cringe host thi yaar, ₹5 ki kinderjoy thi ekdum🙄, merko nhi maalum tha aise log abhi bhi manufacture hote he, 20-25 saal ki teenager, ""wannabe something but actually nothing"" type folks.   
I even brought cards to play but they dismissed it, koi nhi khela mere saath cards😔, aise hi to paisa kamata hu me, jua khel k hi to 2 waqt ki coffee pi paata hu janab☹️ (fir baad me next day Rummy jeet kar compensate ho gya.)

Waha pe wo log kya baat kar rhe the merko kuchh samajh me nhi aaya, sab kuchh dimaag k upar se nikal gya😵‍💫, jo bhi tha ""mere liye"" wo sab bhot cringe tha, my brain would've blasted if I sat there for longer than I did. My brain was shouting at me in 69 languages to runaway from there, aur mene unko bol bhi diya that ""this was The Worst Meetup Ever, and I don't think that I'm going to do this again"". Aur mera iske alawa koi opinion nhi tha kisi k bhi baare me, kyoki mujhe pata hi nhi tha kya chal rha he waha, me to so gya tha with eyes wide-open (personal super-power).   
  
  
Overall bhot hi bura, braindraining, mood-kharab experience tha, me zyada der wo sab jhel hi nhi paaya, sab logo k aane k baad, me lagbhag 40-50 min baad waha se bhaag gya. (at exactly 5:47 host came, and the actual meetup started). Aur me to fir bhi chalo waha se jaldi bhaag gya tha aur fir baad me Ghumakkad Gang k saath masti kar k mood chakachak ho gya, but someone else had an even worse experience, apparently mere jaane k baad me bhi bhot baatein huyi, pith pichhe chugli karna wagerah, wagerah.. I wasn't even aware about all that, I didn't even think of that meetup after I left, wo to mod bhai ne phone laga k sab bataya merko.. Special thanks to our sweetest mod  u/Master_of_Nothing96 ❤️❤️❤️

Mene waha se apne ghar ki nhi balki mere friend k cafe ki cab book kari, kyoki dimaag ka washing machine ban chuka tha, mood ki 12 baj gyi thi, and I wanted to fix my mood, more like cure it. Me kareeb 20 min me, at around 7 PM Suto Cafe pahuch gya tha, aur mene ""Ghumakkad Gang"" me bhi message daal diya ki jo bhi aa sakta he jaldi se aa jao, asli meetup karna he..  
So not much after that worst meetup ever, I had one of the best meetups yet😎, bhot achche log he sab🥰😇, I love them all❤️❤️❤️. I'm so gratefull to all of them.. Ekdum emotional kardiya merko🥺, ek message pe sablog aa gye... Aur uske baad me bhot zordar mazedaar meetup hua, maza hi aa gya.. In sab jitna bhi thank you bolu utna kam he.. Best he sab log..   
Now I don't much regret that worst meetup either, kyoki usi wajah se baad me bhot jordar meetup ho gya.. (uski post bhi daalunga thodi der me, I'll post it from the community account [u/Ghumakkad-Gang](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ghumakkad-Gang/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), ye experience ko personal account se share karna hi better laga mujhe).

Thanks everyone ❤️❤️❤️

Things I’ve experienced while being hired. 
1. Manager’s Retreat: My main manager disappeared for the last two days of my training to go on a “managers-only retreat.” Apparently, they saw Bruno Mars while the rest of us were trying to figure out how to steam milk without burning it.
2. The Bakery Incident: I got in trouble for taking home three bakery items that were going to be thrown away at closing. Lesson learned: waste is better than sharing.
3. Coffee Grounds Guy: A man came in asking for our used coffee grounds. When I asked my manager if I could give them to him, instead of just saying no, the manager went out front and basically kicked the poor guy out.
4. Butter Side Down: One coworker (who thankfully transferred) saw me put a grilled cheese butter-side up. Instead of correcting me, he slammed open the oven door while I was standing right there, smacking my arm, just to scold me for three minutes. Apparently, butter side up once caused a bad burn accident at our location, so the rule is butter side down only. Cool rule, terrible delivery.
5. Watery Latte Lady: A woman showed up 30 minutes after her mobile order was made. I offered to remake it or refund her. She was annoyed I interrupted her phone call, snatched the drink, and left. Seven minutes later she came storming back in, slammed it on the counter, and said her latte was “too watery.”
6. Expired Lemon Loaf Lady: A customer complained about lemon loafs being “expired.” When I asked to see them, she brought in 20 sealed lemon loaf’s still in plastic bags which we don’t even hand out at my store. We have to take them out cause they don’t say the BBD on them, when I called my shift lead over she had to turn her away because gets this, Turns out she bought them two months ago at a different location in a different state and didn’t have a receipt. What exactly was she expecting?
7. The Homeless Complaint: A woman picking up a mobile order complained it was a “bad look for our business” to have a homeless woman sitting outside on the curb. What did she want me to do? 
8. The Thermos Blessing: A man came in asking for hot water. After I filled his thermos, he spent the next 15 minutes blessing me with his love for Jesus while business was slow.
9. The Meeting: My first work meeting featured training videos warning us that customers shouldn’t have to wait three minutes in line. Three minutes?? I’ve waited longer just to pay for gum at a gas station.
10. “Atta Girl”: Most recently, I was pouring a latte for a couple of older guys after their run when one of them said, “atta girl.” Still deciding if that was supposed to be encouraging or patronizing.

1n3nry6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrizmLockerRoom/comments/1n3nry6/does_caffeine_before_training_actually_boost/,"Does caffeine before training actually boost performance, or just feel like it?","Caffeine is the most widely used “performance enhancer” in sports, from pre-workouts to energy drinks to a simple cup of coffee. But does it actually make you faster/stronger, or is it just keeping you awake?

Here’s what the research shows:

* Caffeine is an **ergogenic aid** — it can improve endurance, reaction time, and even strength in many athletes.
* Timing matters: most studies show best results when taken **\~45–60 minutes before exercise.**
* The dose is usually **3–6 mg/kg of bodyweight** (a strong cup of coffee is \~100 mg).
* Downsides: too much = jitters, stomach upset, poor sleep if taken late.
* Individual differences are huge — some athletes feel wired, others barely notice a change.

**Takeaway for athletes:**  
Caffeine can definitely help performance, but it’s not magic. Timing, dose, and your personal tolerance make the difference. If you regularly consume it, especially in high doses, your tolerance is likely high and you won't get the same benefits/effects as someone who doesn't.

How do you use caffeine for performance -- coffee, pre-workout, energy drinks, or nothing at all? Have you actually noticed a measurable difference?",1,1756513410.0,PrizmLockerRoom,0,1.0,False

At some point in my early youth, I elected to try what I only knew at the time as ""hot tea"" - orange pekoe fannings made by the same companies that make the iced tea blends.  I enjoyed it, or at least the novelty of it, every time I had the chance to try it.

After high school, I went off to college and was exposed to a lot more of the world.  In fact, my roommate was an international student from a small island nation I had only heard of in geography class:  Sri Lanka.  He shared his favorite Ceylon with me, and from that point on, I was hooked.

For two decades now, I've enjoyed the various teas I could find at my local big box or grocery stores:  Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow, and Twinings' various Teas and ""Herbal Teas.""  I was more likely to make myself a cup of tea than a pot of coffee.  Friends and family would often gift me those ""tea gift sets"" you find at big box stores around Christmas, and I would occasionally order a box of something like Yorkshire Gold from Amazon to try something from outside my region.  

A local tea shop opened several years back, and I began to learn a bit about loose-leaf teas and the difference water temperature makes.  I invested in infuser mugs and an electric kettle, and was learning more about tea than I ever had before.  Sadly, that tea shop was not able to stay open and is no longer around, so I've gone right back to enjoying my grocery store teas as best I could.

A few months ago, I started seeing short videos in my social media feeds talking about a style of tea I had never heard of, called ""gongfu,"" and discussing tea in a much different way than I've ever thought of it.  Several trips down the rabbit hole later, here I am.  

I've started looking at ways to take my tea journey down paths I never knew existed.  I've looked at some simple gongfu sets and better quality loose-leaf teas from online vendors.  I have enjoyed Harney and Sons's HT Blends in the past, so I'm thinking of trying some of their other teas.  

In the future, I hope to compare Western brewing methods and Eastern brewing methods using the same ""better quality"" tea, so I can learn to appreciate this new world I've stumbled into.",2,1756513338.0,tea,0,0.75,False

I’m already on an elimination diet (wheat and dairy) for EoE, so the thought of eliminating even more foods sounds daunting but it’s rough over here.

Typical day of eating:

Coffee

1.) Overnight oats (oats, soy milk, egg white protein powder, fruit, sugar free maple syrup, hemp seeds)

2.) Omelette (eggs, egg whites, Canadian bacon and frozen spinach) with gluten free toast and/or fruit.

3.) Chicken or tuna salad on a bed of greens with dried fruit, sunflower seeds and a fat free/sugar free dressing. A piece of fruit and sometimes a bite of dark chocolate and a Coke Zero. Sometimes I have a sandwich on gluten free bread and a glass of soy milk if I’m not feeling a salad.

Coffee

4.) Some version of meat, veg and rice or potatoes

5.) Protein ice cream made in my Ninja Creami (soy milk, egg white protein powder, Splenda, allulose, vodka, guar gum, xantham gum and vegetable glycerin.)

It has been a few days since I received the infamous letter, and I am still convincing myself that it is real. That I will really be on this season’s filming of Daredevil Devotion. Gladice and I are walking into the new coffee shop in South End.

Charlotte has been a bittersweet city for me, a place where I fell in love, and where my heart was torn to pieces. Still, I can’t imagine moving back home to Detroit. The winters and I have never gotten along.

“So… has he reached out?”

“Logan?” I ask, knowing damn well who she means. “Of course not.”

She drops her shoulders, and I try to focus on the chalkboard menu in front of me. The seasonal flavors are written in pastel colors, but I always go for a French vanilla latte with oat milk.

“I was just asking, you know, because of the article,” she says quietly.

I didn’t mean to make her feel bad. But of course Logan, my ex-fiancé, who made it painfully clear he wants nothing to do with me hasn’t reached out.

I sigh. “What are you getting? Maybe I’ll try a seasonal flavor.”

“Okay, off-limits subject. I hear you,” she says, finally, she’s catching on. “Well, have you gotten the nerve to DM any of last season’s contestants?” 

I’ve thought about it. I follow a lot of last season’s stars. Most of them gained over a million Instagram followers after the show aired. Last season was messy though, like really messy. I wonder if my season will be as popular. How many followers will I gain?

“Not yet.”

“Here, give me your phone. I’ll do it!” Gladice reaches into my purse but I quickly dodge her grabby hands. 

I try not to admit it, but if this season takes off, I could really take my time finding a new job. I wouldn’t have to worry about money with one million followers. But the truth to why I have agreed to this debacle is more depressing: I am at rock bottom. I have nothing to lose.

“Hi, what can I get for you?” The barista’s floral apron tempts me to try the lavender latte.

“French vanilla latte with oat milk, please,” I say, sticking to my usual.

“You’re such a creature of habit,” Gladice teases. “I’ll have the seasonal blueberry lavender. That looks amazing!” She gleams at the barista, Gladice is the type of girl that wears her perfectly whitened smile like a badge of honor. 

The barista glances back at me. “Are you sure you don’t want to change yours? The seasonals have been really popular!”

“I’m sure, thank you,” I tell her.

I swear the barista looks disappointed. 



——————————————-



The sun is out as we stroll past the Lululemon and Abercrombie store, iced lattes in hand. It’s unusually cool for Charlotte this time of year, with a breeze that makes being outside pleasant. False fall, the locals call it. I know the heat will return before September.

“I just don’t see why you’re so nervous all the time,” Gladice says, practically skipping beside me, always happy to deliver one of her usual lectures. “It’s just life, nobody makes it out alive.”

I tune her out, staring at the brick buildings and wondering how much upkeep it takes to keep the perfectly manicured gardens from withering away.

“Do you think they have a professional garden team? Is that a career path?” I ask.

“I’m over here planning your future, your career as an influencer, and you’re over here talking about lazy-eyed Susans!?”

She takes a huge sip of her blueberry lavender latte.

“Black-eyed Susans,” I correct her.

She rolls her eyes as the sun catches her curly blonde hair. Maybe Gladice is the one who should have been accepted onto the show. Did the producers get our applications mixed up?

“Besides,” I tell her, “I’m going on the show to find love.” I’m convincing myself more than her. 

“Looooove.” She drags the word out like it makes her want to gag. “Gross.”

“You know,” I say, “I’m surprised I got on the show and you didn’t.”

She stops and looks at me.

“What do you mean?”

“Well, you’re the outgoing one. The adventurous one. I’m the creature of habit, you said so yourself. I don’t belong on the show. What if they make me do something insane like bungee jump? I’m not bungee jumping. Do you think it’s a breach of contract if I refuse?”

“Girl, breathe.” Gladice sets her hands on my shoulders. “You’re going to be just fine.”

I try to reel my thoughts back into the moment. Susan, my therapist, has been helping since Logan left, but her breathing techniques feel inefficient. Still, I attempt her advice,inhale for six seconds, hold, exhale slowly for six.

I don’t feel much better and now my lungs are aching

Honestly, my wellness podcasts feel more useful. Or maybe I just need anxiety meds.

“Besides,” Gladice shrugs, “I never submitted my application.”

“You what!?” My lungs explode.

**New York Stock Exchange, NYC.**

**October 19, 1987**



Harvey looked out onto the Manhattan skyline as he took a drag of his cigarette. He thought back to his days at Yale, how he and his fraternity threw the best parties on campus, he smiled and let out a small chuckle. Those days were far past him; now he was Vice President of Equiteys trading at Solesman Brothers, with a new mansion in New Jersey, and a bombshell of a wife. He was living the American dream.



Before he could podder some more, a voice came from behind him.



“Harvey!” the voice shouted.



Harvey turned around to see Adam, his coworker and closest friend. Both of them had started at the firm the same year, and both were from Rhode Island. Naturally, they became close, almost like brothers.



“Adam, what's going on?”Harvey asked jovially



“The meeting with the director is about to start.”Adam said with a smug grin.""Can’t start without the VP.”



“Your VP too,” Harvey said jokingly.



“I know, but it's fun to bust your balls,” Adam said with a smile and chuckle.



The two made their way back inside and down the hall towards the meeting room. As they walked, Harvery looked to his left to see the trading floor.""It looks like a jungle down there.”He thought.



 He never really enjoyed being down on the floor; grown men acting like wild animals never made him feel comfortable. The only thing he liked about the floor was the money. That was his reason for anything, really. Money made the world go round, and as long as the money flowed, so did society.



Adam opened the door to the meeting room, inside sat the management of the firm and the director himself.



“Perfect, now that everyone's here, I think it's time to begin.”The director said in his usual ""let's get down to business"" tone, the same tone he used to start the firm in the first place.“As you know, with the Soviet economy in the shitter, some of our investments overseas are in jeopardy. I've been told most of the investments in Europe and Central America have been secured, but Africa and Asia are starting to get a bit rocky. We need to”



Just then, a new associate burst through the door, panting and sweating like the building was on fire.



“What's the meaning of this? We are in an important meet-” The director was interrupted once more.”It's the Dow Jones, sir!”The associate, still panting, said the line that would change everything.""It's down, it's down 22.6%!”



The room went completely silent. Everyone sat for what felt like ages.



“Jesus Fucking Christ.”One of the VPs said before stumbling over his chair and rushing out. Another one followed, and another until the meeting room lay a mess of scattered papers, flipped chairs, and spilled coffee.



Adam and Harvey made their way to the trading floor only to see it. The floor was in chaos, not the usual screaming to sell and celebrating as before.No, now everyone was yelling, panicking, some were even crying.



Everything was in the red, from lumber to car manufacturing. All it took was a couple of hours to wipe it all away. All Harvey could do was stand and look at the glowing monitors as they showed the worsening stock prices.



“Harvey!”Adam yelled, shaking Harvey.""We need to go!”



What followed were hours of meetings, calls with clients, and smoking cigarettes, all of which had been but a blur to Harvey. In the span of a morning, Harvey’s world shattered, and with the Federal chairman refusing to act as well as the ever-increasing downward spiral of global stock prices, one thing became clear to him.



**There's no coming back from this.**

The Sweltering comes down. A big bluesand ocean. A deep heavy nauseous blue, like play-dough… Make you vomit. When everything is blue. Walk too long… Go mad – into spasms. Can’t take the bluesand ocean. It makes me sick… With a blue sky above – a light – clashing sort of wispy or haze, with clouds, memories like that.

The white sands, back in Texas, or New Mexico, and I trudge further out… A deep overcast. Much better. Under a heavy gloom… No blue there. Wander around in the snowy dune sand, miles and miles. The gray haven-like feeling coming down over the whole thing… Just waiting for the ordeal, the sleightmare to be yanked and pulled by everyone, dragged under, Dane and all. Attack me on every side. Stay low, sink in the sand, don’t follow, don’t follow… It’s nice here… Get out while you can.

Can’t get space. No peace. Tired. Need it slow – the horrible dragging with the blame, when they’re lucky I wasn’t like him. And everybody’s dead in some blue desert – and none of it matters. And the news didn’t matter because.

All sad in the blue sand. The thing they do. Am I dreaming. Is it all a lie? I can’t be… Alone and alone. The serpent from far away – saw her eyes somewhere. Waiting for what? Can’t think! Something else… Oh that. Dinner and a movie… Folded up, all the art, felt pretty cool, simple. All I wanted was to weep. It was unbearable. Made sense just the way it was there… The flaming, just to pull it out some way and not bury the years because, because – it’s not my fot. Just need the dove or I die!

The way it is. Of heart sick winds. And Kaaa – Christmas loving – under trees – the great ourney, so good it never began. And the world in blue and pink. Flaming skies. Ets of silver over a dead white… Angel kisses and velvet obsession – forgot her name – the current year… Where she was born! Who cares, that! And saw myself – in a blaze between warrior kisses and love bundle… Succulence…

Passion languishing on pages. She took me far away… The girl with the loving doveing cute and merciful mad and laughing in a solo vault – like a dim place all made out from watching too many films, sees the thing… Abhorrent – pain… Crushed like fool with nowhere to go. The shards of the flesh sucked out, told her to lie there. Get the skirt and the leash. I’ll take her out. Hum… Or just go for coffee or something and get hot and heavy.

I’ll pull the threads – one seam at a time, pinching slow and steady. Watch her wince and cover her face- embarrassed and tickled as the thread melts… Get messed over with no sympathy until I can see her. Go sit in church, kiss her belly because I can’t take it. Lord hep me – a blue top! A flashing vision! It looks soft… Write for her and give a kiss – too much too stupid. It’s all about a way… there’s no other reason…

A secret chapter. Calming down with whatever is going on… The world and presidents. Nations… A laugh to them. Her shirt made of frosting, slurped away by a cute slurping pink dream loins of love fruit and lips. The sap and the swelling thigh… slender dreams of a cream cloud princess longing for a devil’s touch. Hmmmmm…

Anything, when it’s just as good. Blaa! – The light white face of the moon love silk – flowing off her… Stained in the blaze, the burning walls of the siege, far loft from her tower… Far, perfect, slurping her dress like a soup until there’s nothing there… Cold by the warmth, the blaze of night, fire… Pale as the skin, as the sheets fuse… Soft rolls around, forgotten all by the noise – the thrusting shocks of perfume, the aroma of melded skin, arching soft, a private dawn of fain light betwixt the crying thrust of steel, unheard.

A maidens belly curved and loved in midnight, with the roaring below. The mad clamor and shivering… The tongue washing the flesh and the shafts that echo. Through the desert wasteland. The walls and buildings alight with flames in the warm of the sky as they, far and mast away in the tower, the chambers… black and red. The lips take you… Playfully under the silent rose of scarlet cheeks… Sucking the silk of the bed chamber, the scourge of shouts.

The fire grows, the roaring, a tumult of clashes. The black sky. A tempest red beneath the baldican…

A tower of pyrric night cast aside with smoke entwined as the soft star winks through. The rage and the bursting of wood. The desert receives the vanishing of their cries. Woes and tears. Never a thought where the lovers lie…",1,1756512272.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

1n3n982,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n3n982/aita_for_emotionally_detaching_myself/,AITA for emotionally detaching myself,"To make this easier to picture, put yourself in my shoes and imagine what it would be like if it were to happen to you. 

You get out of a toxic relationship in high school, graduate, and start working night shifts (9 p.m. to 7 a.m.) as a waitress. You're single for about 6 months. Life is great. Then, after some time, you think you'll give dating life a try again. You download a dating app. No matches for almost 2-3 weeks. You start to lose hope in the dating app, but no hard feelings. Finally, on the day you told yourself, ""After today, if there's no matches I like, I'll just delete it,"" you end up matching with someone, have a conversation for a few hours, stay up all night, and it goes great. You talk for a couple more weeks, and you finally schedule a date. And then another date for the same time next week. You're head-over-heels. Towards the end of the 2nd date, they ask you to be their bf/gf. Life is great, you're long-distance for a couple of weeks, but make the occasional drive to see each other. Finally, one moves in with the other. Fast forward 3 months in, and you guys find out you're pregnant! You're over the moon. You keep working, even asking for more hours at work in preparation for the baby. Meanwhile, the other person can barely go a month without getting fired from a job and takes a month or more to find a new one. And this is a constant thing happening throughout the entire pregnancy. The longest gap without a job was 4-5 months. Meanwhile, you're working yourself to death in preparation for maternity leave cause the company doesn't offer paid maternity leave unless you've been there a year or more and are full-time. You were not because you had to switch positions at work due to the pregnancy, and the most hours they can give you are four to five 4-hour shifts. Which is only 25 or fewer hours a week. You're already struggling to get by in life, financially supporting yourself and your unemployed partner. And THEY are the ones having to take you to your OB appointments every week. What are they doing while you've been working? Sleeping till noon, playing video games, driving out and about everywhere, hanging out with friends, staying out till 1, 2, 3 a.m. They're driving all over God's green earth and yet YOU'RE the one having to put gas in their tank to get to doctor appointments every week. Which is a 45-minute drive on the highway, by the way. Wanting to buy this, wanting to go out to eat, and having to gas up their vehicle. And it's ALL having to come out of your measly $450 check you get every 2 weeks from your shitty job, but it's the best you can do. You're doing everything to keep them happy cause that's just who you are. A people pleaser. 

FAST FORWARD

You finally give birth, right on the baby's due date. Incredible considering it's the first. From basically the moment of the birth, till the baby is 2 weeks out, your partner starts pressuring you to move into their mother's house. Which was HOURS away from YOUR family. YOUR ENTIRE support system. Saying that where we were currently residing wasn't big enough for you guys and the baby. Even though it was. Even after constantly telling them ""no"", ""I don't want to move"", ""I wouldn't have any support system"", meanwhile, they're saying, ""Yeah, but we'll be with my family. They'll be your support system. My friends are your friends too"". People who don't know you from Adam are supposedly your new support system. You'd be moving away from all of your family, what little friends you already have, because Lord knows pregnancy truly shows you who your real friends are. Family, friends, the town you've lived in your whole life, everything you've ever known. But they keep on and keep on insisting. 

You end up caving in because no matter what you say or do, they won't take no for an answer. A few weeks go by, and you get postpartum depression, which was prone to happening anyway, considering you already have a history with depression. It eventually gets worse and worse, you're barely getting any sleep at night, and your body won't let you sleep during the day. You feel like you're going crazy, getting MAYBE 2 hours of sleep a night. Barely any help with the baby. Your partner helps with the baby when it makes them look good. You're going literally crazy. The depression gets bad enough that your partner and their family start pressuring you to go to the E.R. for it. You keep telling them no because your 6-week postpartum check-up is less than a week away. You already know they'll ask if this is a problem and if I need help. And you do exactly that, they put you on Lexapro. But later down the line, it starts to mess up your relationship in the bedroom. If you don't already know the side effects of antidepressants, look them up. So eventually, after a couple of months, you finally get the hang of being a parent, and you form a routine for you and your baby. While the baby is still asleep, take advantage of the time to eat breakfast, have coffee, take medicine, and enjoy the silence of the house while everyone is gone at work. And this is the usual routine until maternity leave is over.  

FAST FORWARD

It gets around your birthday, and while your partner is in the shower, you decide to get on their phone to take some pictures for them to have on their phone. Well, while on their phone, you find out their ex was sending them inappropriate photos. All of this THREE DAYS before your birthday. But you don't tell them that you know. After a couple of weeks, you finally confront them. They say ""nothing was going on and those photos were unsolicited, were never asked for"". They blocked and cut off all contact with their ex for you. You EXPLICITLY tell them it's going to take some time to regain trust, that things aren't just gonna go back to normal. So for them not to extra any lovey dovey crap or interest in being intimate. Not even a month later, they want some from you. The combination of the Lexapro side effects and the lack of trust still obviously leads to turning them down. Over and over and over. They get butt hurt but are understanding. Over time, they become not so understanding and ""just want to pretend and act like what I did never happened"" and for us to go back to normal. It gets blown into this big argument and somehow ends up with you trying to leave them and take the baby with you. They get their mother involved, and everyone is trying to pin you for being a bad partner and bad parent for not wanting to put out and for wanting to take the baby with you. Even tho YOU are the only one truly taking care of the baby. The only one taking the baby to doctor appointments, buying clothes, diapers, wipes, and the one waking up in the middle of the night to take care of the baby. While packing suitcases, they take the baby out of the house without you knowing and turn off their location. You call the police, and they show up, tell them your side of the story, and they explain that because you are not married, both parents have equal rights to the child, so there was nothing they could do unless the baby was being harmed. So after some time, they finally pick up the phone, and you decide to stick it out. For the sake of the baby. You start doing everything you can to keep them happy. Even though you're the one suffering and is unhappy doing what makes them happy. You stop taking your meds to make them happy. You end up draining your bank account to make them happy. You stop haggling with them to help with household chores or to help with the baby, to make them happy. But eventually, you have had enough and you tell them that it has to come to an end. That you're still unhappy and that something has got to give because it's unfair. Being a full-time mom while working a full-time job, doing all the housework with no help from anyone. Over all that time, you've already emotionally unattached yourself from them. You stop doing things for them and only do things for yourself and the baby. They want their laundry done? They can do it themselves. They want their side of the room cleaned up? They can do it themselves. They need money because they've already blown through their weekly $600 paycheck after 2 days? They can call their parent or friend for money cause you're done funding their stupidity. You're finally able to keep your head above water, and you realize it was because of them that you were drowning. 

They can't manage to hygienically take care of themselves. They work in fast food and only shower maybe twice a week, and can barely remember to brush their teeth. And yet cause an argument because you keep swerving on them when they try to kiss you. You finally blow up and become honest with them. This happened today. 

You: It's because you stink! I don't want all of that in my grill! 

Them: But I just brushed my teeth earlier

You: You still stink. There are only so many reasons why I've been swerving on you. Because I either don't want a kiss or you stink! 

Them: Well, gee, thanks. Tell me how you really feel. 

You: Well, did you want me to lie to you and say you smell like a flower garden?! You want honesty, be prepared to get your feelings hurt. And don't complain when you get your feelings hurt, cause you brought it upon yourself. 

Them: Fine then. I'm gonna take a shower and head out. 

You. Okay. Bye then.

Them: \*freshly out of the shower and dressed, grabbing car keys\* You're not gonna stop me from going out?

You: Why would I need to stop you from going out? You're a grown adult who makes your own decisions. It's not like there's anything I can say or do that'll make you stop. You've already made up your mind as to what you're gonna do. So go do whatever the f\*\*k you want. 

Mind you, this was all 2 hours or so before they had to go to work. And you check their location at the time they're supposed to be at work, and they're still at the location they went to before. Later on, you get a notification that they arrived at work almost 40 minutes after they were supposed to already be there. 

Sorry for this being dragged out, trying to sum everything up, but still fit in details to really paint the picture. But AITA for emotionally detaching myself due to their behavior and treating them the way I feel like they deserve, but staying in the relationship for the sake of the baby?

Soooo long story short I have been with Starbucks as a whole since January, however I just switched over from a kiosk in a grocery store to an actual Starbucks almost two months ago. This was after heavy encouragement from one of my old coworkers who used to work at a company store and who was a coffee master. He became my biggest mentor and he gave me constructive advice and I felt like/he told me I grew a ton.
However I feel like I got a job at THE WORST location ever. My SM is super strict (like being written up if your a minute late type strict, which I get is policy but there is no grace for certain situations) My SM also makes me feel like I’m the dumbest person alive and loves to call me out on what I’m doing wrong, and never telling me I’m doing anything right. In fact, she told me I was doing the shaken espresso routine wrong and called me out on it in front of everyone (I knew I was right and I told her as such) she pulled up the file to prove me wrong, and it only showed I was right and ever since then her hostility has went from bad to worse. 
One of the SSV that I work with a ton is also really mean, and also make me feel like an idiot. I’m not going to go into stories but it’s bad bad.
This job has really affected my mental health for the worst. I had my first panic attack and been engaging in $H again. Unfortunately I’m the type of person who takes what people say about me to heart and being told I’m not smart everyday at my job has really lowered my self confidence and overall self perception.
I really wanna quit but I wanna know if I should try for a transfer bc I do like the actual work part. I know I’m only two months in but is there a way around this? Or am I just fine with cutting my losses now?

My husband is sleeping on the couch currently while she naps in her bassinet and I watch House re-runs and ice my stitches. Should I be doing other stuff? Sure. Am I crying into my coffee cup instead? Yup.

I know I'm still in the baby blues and my husband and I are watching for PPD, but I'm thinking that this is just how you feel when you're panic re-acting 24 hours a day on little to no sleep to the needs of a beautiful sack of angry potatoes who seemingly hates you 90% of the time. 
My husband is a natural dad - everything seemingly comes super easy to him with her. I thought I was a natural, but it's like every maternal instinct I've ever felt in my life vanished from my body the moment she tore me open. 
I don't know what she wants or needs most of the time and feel so out of my depth. I am trying so hard to enjoy this stage before it's gone but God, I really think I can't wait for it to be over and for her to be ""easier.""

Breast feeding? Utter failure
State of our house? Cluster fuck
Parent schedule? Non-existent 
Unforeseen health issues? She's got those
Wake windows? Anybody's guess day to day

I've been keeping a little list of the things that make this period worth it and it's mostly her big beautiful eyes when we're starting at each other, or when she falls asleep to the sound of my voice, or when my husband and I can share a quiet kiss or he beams at her during a gas bubble smile.
I'm trying to remind myself that the priority is just to keep her fed, clean, healthy, and loved at this stage and that I don't need to stress about anything else. 
Patterns will emerge, the chores will still be there, sleep will come. But this part sucks and I am dragging myself through it.
I don't know how y'all did it or are doing it, but kudos to everybody for muddling through. Here's to better days.

Two bags of baked goods and sandwiches, $10 total (estimated regular menu price $80).","I had never heard of this place before I saw it on the app yesterday, but I'll try anything once when it has a good rating (4.8), even if it means driving to/parking in downtown Saint Paul (I got lucky and scored the last available parking spot on the block).

Out of curiosity, I looked them up this morning to find out what kinds of sandwiches and baked goods they have...and that's when I found out they're closed for remodeling/construction today through the end of next week. I was wondering how I was going to pick up food from a place that isn't open, and figured maybe they forgot to turn off TGTG while they're closed.

I dialed the phone number on their website, and my call was answered by Terry John Zila, the owner and chef. He assured me my order was legit and told me they're doing pickups in the lobby of the office building where the shop is located. He was very kind, friendly, and helpful. It was the best one minute conversation I've had with a stranger in quite some time!

When I arrived, there was nobody at the shop or in the lobby...just a guy at the security/information desk who quickly understood what was going on and made a phone call and then told me ""Terry said he's running late, he'll be here in a few minutes"".

Terry showed up about five minutes later with my bags in hand. He was super apologetic about the delay, and overall just really sweet and personable. I'm not even going to ding them on the rating for pick-up experience because the state fair is going on right now, and that mucks up absolutely everything related to driving/traffic in the east metro.

Anyway...each of my bags contained four different sandwiches and one bakery item. No duplicate items in either bag. When I laid out all eight sandwiches, there were six different ones, so two duplicates across the two bags. I ate one half of each of the two dupes for a very tasty and filling afternoon snack. Delicious!

I'm pretty sure one of them was their vegan sandwich, and it was my favorite of the two I tried even though I am a certified meat lover. I will definitely be freezing a few of the sandwiches, because there's a limit to how many sandwiches a person can eat in one weekend.

Based on a quick look at their menu prices, I got about $80 worth of food for $10. Five stars, I'll be back!

1n3n5s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n3n5s8/my_27m_girlfriends_23f_step_dad_is_a_sexual/,"My (27M) girlfriends (23F) step dad is a sexual predator, how can I gently push her to speak to a professional?","I've been with my girlfriend for about 1.5 years. To go to the beginning, when she was in year 11 roughly (about 16-17 years old), her step brother broke his phone, and borrowed an old phone of my girlfriends. On the phone were some videos of my girlfriend sneaking out of the house at night, meeting up with her friends and drinking alcohol, and doing teenage things of that nature, nothing too out of the ordinary. He brought this to his step dads attention, which then led her step dad to confront and blackmail her with this content. He wanted sexual favours in return for him not bringing this to her mothers attention.   
  
When my girlfriend told her mum that her step dad was blackmailing her, her mum completely denied it, and refused to believe her. Exactly how this conversation went, I'm not too sure, my girlfriend has only told me this specific story once, and we've never gone over the details as it's a pretty intense thing to bring up. But there's no getting around the fact that her step dad proved to be a predator by blackmailing his 16-17 year old step daughter for sexual favours.

The following year my girlfriend graduated high school and moved cities to go to university, a big reason for this was to move away from her home situation, she spent that time between that situation, and moving out, in a lot of anxiety.

On a couple occasions over the years, when my girlfriend went back home to visit family, she had broken down to her mum because of the fact that her mum is married to this guy, and each time, her mum would dismiss her, and again just deny everything, and bury her head further in the sand. Shes never admitted this, but its pretty evident that my girlfriend has lost a lot of trust and respect for her mum over the years.

This scenario apart, she describes their relationship in a way that is very one sided, her mum fully pays for all the holidays they go on, she buys coffee's every morning, dinners out are always paid for by her. My girlfriend has witnessed him speaking to her mum in a fairly disrespectful manner, to which her mum just shouts down and doesnt respond. This type of dynamic frustrates my girlfriend a lot.

I've done my best to confide my girlfriend when I can about this, but a situation of this is admittedly beyond my capabilities. My girlfriend has done so well to get to where she is, she is a very kind, mature and emotionaly intelligent person, you would never guess that she garners such heavy baggage. But as we get older, she is starting to question her mother more, and these issues are starting to resurface. She doesn't deal with them in an unhealthy way, but it seems that she has these very complex questions that I think only a professional would be able to help her with. 

I write this right now, because my girlfriend has texted me this morning (she went back home to visit her mum) saying she is super pissed off right now and wants to come home. Reason being, last night her mum invited my girlfriends step dad out for dinner, when it was supposed to just be my girlfriend and her mum. This morning, my girlfriend was supposed to go for a walk with her grandma and mum, but she again invited the step dad. Earlier this year, my girlfriend had planned to go back home for a week, and the plans were set in stone. Only though, after a couple weeks, her mum completely vito'd it, because her step daughter needed a place to stay temporarily, so she stayed in my girlfriends room for that time. The plans were never re-scheduled. For context, her mum owns the house they live in, the step dad just lives there, my girlfriend still has her room there, as the house belongs to her mum, so my girlfriend was a bit upset that her mum gave her room away. She admitted to me the other day that she's never felt like her mums first priority, and its instances like this that give her that impression.

This is a situation I also think about daily as I think it is super fucked up how everything panned out, and I hate that this happened to my girlfriend so undeservedly, but I really think it would help my girlfriend to speak with a professional about this, but I dont want to push her as I understand thats a very poor way to go about things, also just keen to hear someones thoughts on this situation, as I'm not able to speak to any friends or family about this",1,1756511667.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

This is because my mother asks for the estate to pay for things like diapers and hospital beds and elevators and cleaners and under minimum wage payment since she can no longer work her real job (which pays more - my family is actively losing money looking after my grandmother). My grandma has money - it’s just locked away by my aunt who put it in a gic account under her name (this is theft actually lol). 

My aunt continued to send emails where she says we are undeserving of basic wages for any labour done and her children (my cousins) send us vitriolic emails about how we’ve ruined their beautiful relationship with grandma (they can come visit whenever they’d like - we’d appreciate some help even if that’s just hanging out with grandma ffs) 

Anyways grandma had to be put in a home bc we can no longer afford to not be working actual paid jobs. She’s miserable and having worse psychotic symptoms and saying the nurses are sexual abusers. 

I asked to be paid under half of what a normal cleaner would charge to empty her house - instant refusal from aunt. (Even though she’s hired me to clean her house before but whatever) 

So I blew up. I told her everything I’ve been holding in all these years looking after grandma. 

I told her she was a bad sister to my mother. I told her my mother would be better equipped to deal with this stress if she had better adults around her as a child. This is a secret dig bc my aunt in her early twenties allegedly introduced my 14 year old mother to adult men who would abuse her. This is because my aunt would also allegedly give my mother alcohol when she was a child to entertain her boyfriends. 

My mother was an alcoholic my entire childhood. I can’t help but feel some rage in knowing it was her who gave her her first drinks. As an adult. I am a younger sibling but my sister wouldn’t ever do that shit. Anyways childhood was rough wish my mom had better guidance as a kid. 

Wish I didn’t have to fight her battles as her child. It’s not fair and I know it’s far beyond enmeshment. I should be living my own life not dwelling on drama from the 70s. 

ANYWAYS , then I bussed home and was shaking. I always sit in the front bus seats bc I get sick (I’m way too mentally unwell to drive ever lol) but I heard a group of older teenage boys yelling at a person on the bus for recording (fair, I don’t like being recorded but their language is now starting to get super aggressive toward the alleged recorder) so I turn back in full deep mom voice (I ain’t a mother either, too mentally unwell lol) « boys , please quiet down you are disrupting the other passengers «  (I have car trauma don’t fucking distract the driver). It escalated until I told them to get off the bus with me to which several people thanked me (I swear to fuck this isn’t fake I know it sounds so ‘everyone clapped’) but basically was just me playing double vigilante power tripping on my precious aunt yelling. 

If you’ve read any of this sorry if I missed any Tw or anything. My life is crazy and I don’t have time for any friends rn bc I got too many people to look after. I am drowning a bit. Thanks for listening. Back to scrubbing cleaning everything to fill my rage. ",3,1756511592.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

*Transform your daily perspective with practical gratitude strategies*

## Introduction: The Power of Enough 💫

In our fast-paced world, we're constantly bombarded with messages telling us we need more. More money, more success, more possessions, more achievements. But what if the secret to genuine happiness lies not in acquiring more, but in truly appreciating what we already possess?

The concept of contentment isn't about settling for less or giving up on dreams. It's about developing a profound appreciation for your current circumstances while still pursuing growth and improvement. This mindset shift can revolutionize how you experience each day.

---

## Chapter 1: The Science Behind Contentment 🧠

Research in positive psychology consistently shows that people who practice regular gratitude experience:

**Enhanced Mental Health Benefits:**
- Reduced stress hormones by up to 30%
- Improved sleep quality and duration
- Decreased symptoms of anxiety and depression
- Stronger immune system response

**Improved Social Connections:**
- Better relationships with family and friends
- Increased empathy and compassion
- Enhanced communication skills
- Greater sense of community belonging

**Professional and Personal Growth:**
- Higher productivity levels at work
- Improved decision-making abilities
- Increased resilience during challenges
- Better problem-solving creativity

The human brain is naturally wired to focus on problems and potential threats - a survival mechanism that served our ancestors well. However, in modern life, this negativity bias can prevent us from recognizing the abundance that surrounds us daily.

## Chapter 2: Daily Practices for Cultivating Contentment 📝

### Morning Rituals That Set the Tone 🌅

**The Five-Minute Appreciation Window:**
Start each morning by identifying three specific things you're grateful for. Make them concrete and detailed. Instead of ""I'm grateful for my family,"" try ""I'm grateful for the way my partner made me laugh during breakfast yesterday.""

**The Breath of Acknowledgment:**
Take five deep breaths while mentally acknowledging different aspects of your life: your health, your shelter, your abilities, your relationships, and your opportunities.

**Physical Comfort Recognition:**
Notice the warmth of your bed, the comfort of your clothes, the taste of your morning beverage. These simple pleasures are often overlooked but contribute significantly to daily well-being.

### Midday Perspective Shifts 🌞

**The Comparison Reframe:**
When you catch yourself comparing your situation to others, immediately redirect your attention to your own progress. Ask yourself: ""How have I grown compared to who I was last year?""

**The Problem-Solution Balance:**
For every challenge you face, identify one resource or strength you possess to address it. This builds confidence while acknowledging difficulties realistically.

**The Unexpected Joy Hunt:**
Actively look for small, unexpected positive moments throughout your day. A friendly interaction with a stranger, a beautiful cloud formation, or a perfectly timed green traffic light.

### Evening Reflection Techniques 🌙

**The Daily Highlight Review:**
Before sleep, identify the best moment of your day, no matter how small. This trains your brain to notice positive experiences more readily.

**The Growth Recognition Log:**
Acknowledge one way you improved, learned, or contributed to something meaningful during the day.

**The Tomorrow's Opportunities Preview:**
Instead of worrying about tomorrow's challenges, focus on the opportunities and possibilities the new day will bring.

## Chapter 3: Transforming Complaints into Appreciation 🔄

### The Reframing Technique

Every complaint contains within it an unrecognized blessing. Learning to identify these hidden gifts transforms your entire outlook:

**Instead of:** ""Traffic is terrible today""
**Reframe to:** ""I have a reliable vehicle and the ability to travel wherever I need to go""

**Instead of:** ""Work is so stressful""
**Reframe to:** ""I have skills that others value and a steady income to support myself and my loved ones""

**Instead of:** ""My apartment is too small""
**Reframe to:** ""I have a safe, private space that protects me from the elements""

### The Challenge-Opportunity Matrix

When faced with difficulties, use this mental framework:

1. **Identify the specific challenge**
2. **List the skills or resources it's helping you develop**
3. **Consider how overcoming it will benefit your future self**
4. **Recognize the support systems available to help you**

---

## Chapter 4: Building Long-term Contentment Habits 🏗️

### The Progressive Appreciation Method

Start with appreciating basic necessities and gradually expand your awareness:

**Week 1:** Focus on physical needs (food, shelter, health)
**Week 2:** Acknowledge relationships and connections
**Week 3:** Recognize opportunities and freedoms
**Week 4:** Appreciate personal qualities and abilities

### Creating Environmental Reminders

**Visual Cues:**
Place small objects around your living space that remind you to pause and appreciate. A smooth stone on your desk, a meaningful photo by your bed, or a plant that represents growth and life.

**Technology Integration:**
Set random phone alerts throughout the day with messages like ""What's going well right now?"" or ""Name one thing you're enjoying about this moment.""

**Social Reinforcement:**
Share one thing you appreciate about your life with a friend or family member each day. This creates accountability while spreading positivity.

---

## Chapter 5: Overcoming Common Obstacles 🚧

### The ""Not Enough"" Mindset

**Symptom:** Constantly feeling like you need more to be happy
**Solution:** Practice the ""Enough Experiment"" - for one week, before making any purchase, wait 24 hours and ask yourself if you truly need it or just want it.

### Comparison Trap

**Symptom:** Feeling inadequate when seeing others' achievements or possessions
**Solution:** Develop ""Comparison Immunity"" by focusing on your unique journey and celebrating others' successes as inspiration rather than competition.

### Future Anxiety

**Symptom:** Worrying that current good circumstances won't last
**Solution:** Practice ""Present Moment Anchoring"" by regularly engaging your five senses to ground yourself in current reality.

---

## Chapter 6: The Ripple Effect of Contentment 🌊

### Personal Transformation

When you develop genuine contentment, you'll notice:

**Increased Resilience:**
Challenges become temporary obstacles rather than permanent setbacks. You'll bounce back faster from disappointments because you maintain awareness of what's still going well in your life.

**Enhanced Creativity:**
A contented mind is more open to new possibilities and innovative solutions. Without the constant stress of dissatisfaction, your brain can focus on creative problem-solving.

**Improved Decision Making:**
Decisions become clearer when you're not driven by desperation or the feeling that you ""need"" something to be complete. You can choose based on genuine preferences and values.

### Impact on Relationships

**Deeper Connections:**
When you're content with yourself and your circumstances, you can engage with others from a place of abundance rather than need. This creates healthier, more balanced relationships.

**Increased Generosity:**
Recognizing your own abundance naturally leads to sharing with others, whether through time, attention, resources, or emotional support.

**Better Communication:**
Contentment reduces defensive reactions and increases empathy, leading to more effective and compassionate communication.

### Professional Benefits

**Enhanced Performance:**
Workers who practice contentment report higher job satisfaction and productivity, regardless of their specific role or industry.

**Leadership Development:**
Contented individuals naturally become better leaders because they can inspire others through example rather than desperation or aggression.

**Career Adaptability:**
When you're not attached to specific outcomes or circumstances, you become more flexible and open to new opportunities and career directions.

## Chapter 7: Advanced Contentment Strategies 🎯

### The Temporal Perspective Technique

**Past Appreciation:**
Regularly reflect on how far you've come from difficult periods in your life. This builds confidence and reinforces your ability to navigate challenges.

**Future Gratitude:**
Practice being grateful for opportunities and experiences that haven't happened yet but are possible in your future.

**Present Moment Expansion:**
Develop the ability to find multiple layers of appreciation within a single moment or experience.

### The Challenge Gratitude Practice

**Difficulty Appreciation:**
Learn to find genuine gratitude for challenges that have shaped your character, taught you valuable lessons, or connected you with supportive people.

**Growth Recognition:**
Acknowledge how obstacles have developed qualities like patience, empathy, problem-solving skills, or emotional strength.

### The Abundance Mindset Development

**Resource Recognition:**
Regularly inventory your non-material resources: knowledge, skills, relationships, experiences, and personal qualities.

**Opportunity Awareness:**
Train yourself to notice possibilities and potential in everyday situations that others might overlook.

**Contribution Focus:**
Shift attention from what you can receive to what you can offer, which naturally generates feelings of purpose and fulfillment.

---

## Chapter 9: Maintaining Long-term Success 🎯

### The Plateau Prevention Strategy

**Variety Introduction:**
Regularly change your gratitude practices to prevent habituation. Try different times of day, various focuses, or new methods of acknowledgment.

**Depth Expansion:**
Instead of just acknowledging what you're grateful for, explore why these things matter to you and how they connect to your values and goals.

**Social Integration:**
Involve friends, family, or colleagues in your contentment practices to create accountability and shared positive experiences.

### Dealing with Setbacks

**The Temporary Mindset:**
Remember that feelings of discontentment are temporary and normal. They don't negate your progress or mean you're failing at contentment.

**The Learning Opportunity:**
Use periods of dissatisfaction as information about what might be missing from your life or what areas need attention.

**The Gentle Return:**
When you notice you've slipped into complaint or comparison mode, gently redirect your attention without self-criticism.

### Advanced Integration Techniques

**Workplace Contentment:**
Find ways to appreciate your work environment, colleagues, and opportunities for growth, even in challenging job situations.

**Relationship Enhancement:**
Apply contentment principles to your interactions with family and friends, focusing on what you appreciate about each person rather than what you wish would change.

**Health and Wellness:**
Practice gratitude for your body's capabilities rather than focusing solely on its limitations or imperfections.

## Chapter 10: The Universal Application 🌍

### Cultural Adaptability

These principles work across all cultures and belief systems because they're based on fundamental human psychology rather than specific religious or spiritual frameworks. Whether you approach life from a scientific, philosophical, or practical perspective, the benefits of contentment are universally applicable.

### Timeless Relevance

The strategies outlined here address basic human needs and tendencies that remain constant regardless of technological advancement or social change. The specific applications may evolve, but the core principles will remain relevant for generations to come.

### Personal Customization

**For Analytical Minds:**
Focus on the measurable benefits and track your progress with specific metrics and data points.

**For Creative Individuals:**
Express your contentment through artistic endeavors, whether writing, visual arts, music, or other creative outlets.

**For Social Personalities:**
Emphasize the relationship and community aspects of contentment, sharing your practice with others and building connections through appreciation.

**For Practical Thinkers:**
Concentrate on the tangible improvements in daily life, work performance, and problem-solving abilities that result from contentment practice.

---

## Chapter 11: Building Your Personal Contentment System 🔧

### Assessment and Customization

**Identify Your Contentment Blockers:**
- Perfectionism tendencies
- Comparison habits
- Future anxiety patterns
- Past regret cycles
- Material attachment levels

**Determine Your Motivation Style:**
- Visual reminders and cues
- Social accountability and sharing
- Data tracking and measurement
- Routine integration and habit formation
- Creative expression and exploration

**Choose Your Primary Practices:**
Select 3-5 specific techniques that resonate with your personality and lifestyle, then commit to consistent implementation rather than trying to do everything at once.

### Creating Sustainable Routines

**Micro-Habits Development:**
Start with practices so small they seem almost effortless. Spending 30 seconds acknowledging something positive is better than attempting 20 minutes of gratitude journaling that you won't maintain.

**Environmental Design:**
Arrange your physical space to naturally promote contentment awareness. This might mean decluttering to appreciate what you have, displaying meaningful photos, or creating peaceful spaces for reflection.

**Technology Integration:**
Use apps, alarms, or digital tools to support your practice, but don't become dependent on them. The goal is to develop internal awareness that doesn't require external prompts.

---

## Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Common Challenges ⚡

### When Life Gets Difficult

**Realistic Contentment:**
Contentment doesn't mean pretending everything is perfect. It means acknowledging difficulties while simultaneously recognizing resources, support, and silver linings.

**The Minimum Viable Gratitude:**
During crisis periods, scale back your expectations. Finding one small thing to appreciate each day is sufficient during genuinely challenging times.

**Professional Help Integration:**
If you're dealing with depression, anxiety, or other mental health challenges, these practices can complement but not replace professional treatment.

### Dealing with Criticism

**Response to Skeptics:**
When others question your contentment practice, remember that your internal experience is valid regardless of external opinions. You don't need to convince anyone else of the value you're experiencing.

**Avoiding Toxic Positivity:**
Genuine contentment includes acknowledging negative emotions and difficult circumstances. If your practice becomes a way to avoid dealing with legitimate problems, it's time to reassess your approach.

### Maintaining Authenticity

**Genuine vs. Forced Gratitude:**
Don't force yourself to feel grateful for things that genuinely upset you. Instead, look for related aspects that you can authentically appreciate.

**Personal vs. Prescribed Solutions:**
While these strategies work for many people, adapt them to fit your unique circumstances, personality, and values rather than following them rigidly.

---

## Conclusion: Your Journey Forward 🚀

The path to contentment isn't about reaching a destination where you'll never feel dissatisfied again. It's about developing a more balanced perspective that allows you to navigate life's inevitable ups and downs with greater resilience, joy, and peace.

### Key Takeaways for Daily Life:

**Start Small:** Begin with one simple practice and build gradually rather than attempting to transform your entire mindset overnight.

**Stay Consistent:** Regular, small efforts produce better results than sporadic intensive practices.

**Remain Flexible:** Adapt these strategies to fit your changing circumstances and evolving needs.

**Share the Benefits:** As you experience positive changes, naturally share them with others through your example and encouragement.

**Trust the Process:** Some days will feel more successful than others, and that's perfectly normal. The cumulative effect develops over time.

### Your Next Steps:

1. **Choose one morning practice** to implement for the next week
2. **Select one evening reflection technique** that appeals to you
3. **Identify three environmental cues** you can create to remind yourself of contentment principles
4. **Find one person** with whom you can share your journey
5. **Set a realistic timeline** for evaluating your progress

Remember, this isn't about becoming perfectly content with everything in your life. It's about developing the ability to recognize and appreciate the abundance that already exists while still pursuing meaningful growth and improvement.

The beauty of contentment lies in its accessibility. You don't need special equipment, expensive courses, or dramatic life changes to begin experiencing its benefits. Everything you need is already within your reach - you simply need to develop the awareness to recognize it.

Your life, as it exists right now, contains numerous sources of genuine satisfaction and joy. The challenge isn't to create these sources from nothing, but to develop the perception to notice them and the wisdom to let them enhance your daily experience.

This moment, this day, this life - they're already enough. And from this foundation of enough, anything is possible.

---

*The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Your step toward contentment begins with your next breath, your next thought, your next moment of awareness. The path is already beneath your feet.* ✨

My current setup is a Breville bambino plus and a Breville Smart Grinder Pro. I almost always drink milk coffees (lattes/cappucinos). (I sometimes have macchiatos)

I want to start buying decaf (there's some decent companies in Australia known for producing quality stuff) which I can then enjoy coffee in the evening, or on extra days when I want to restrict my caffeine intake.

The smart grinder pro really isnt setup for swapping beans.

I am looking at getting a second grinder, but unsure if I should maintain 2 grinders, or get away with having 1 that is easy to switch settings back and forth on depending on the beans i'm using.

I figure some single dose grinders are easy enough to adjust and could fit this criteria but unsure about whats good for milk coffees and easy setting changes.

I know a lot of people in [r/espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/) love their D54. Is a flat burr ideal for milk coffee or am I better off with a conical? I prefer medium>darker roasts anyway. I usually look for caramel, biscuit, chocolate sort of flavours.

She's grown and she's a runt from the looks of it, she's smaller than Maisy whose a normal sized rat. We bought them medium. They seem to not be interested in pets, or touches. But they enjoy being tossed in on the bed and blankets, because they come back to be tossed again.

We are on a budget, and we try our best with them. I personally just feel like they don't have enough space to really run around and have fun. Their cage is big enough from what I measured it was over 30 cubic feet, but I still feel like the cage is too small. But we can't currently afford a bigger cage, despite sources saying that it's big enough. When I say we are very tight on money we're VERY tight. But it's not a situation where I need to rehome them. we can buy food, water, and we clean their cage. If we can't afford tunnels, or hammocks, we'll use unused fabrics or t-shirts that have no use because nobody can wear them, or are torn. I give them cardboard, and I try to give them a lot of things to chew on.

For starters. Is their behavior of not really being interesting in petting or touching normal for younger rats? If not. I'm fine with having rats that don't like being touched because I can give them affection in other ways like treats and playing. Maisy has licked me, and Uzi grooms me, they just don't stick around for pets because they always seem to be preoccupied with running around the room or getting into mischief.

Secondly. Any advice on other things I can do to make toys, and help them find other ways to play? My family is crafty, and my dad knows how to do things with wood, that he has passed down onto me. We have things in the basement like that special rougher rope that they can bite on, and all kinds of things. 

Third. Is it safe to share my coffee with Uzi? If not, how do I teach her to stop getting into it.

I would sort of expect 6-7kg loss by now. 

Im on 2.5mg

High protein 150-180gms //Low carbs diet this means no bread, rice, pasta, potato, no deep-fried, no oily foods. Im just getting carbs from other veg/egumes, my coffee once day maybe a banana bread but about 1/4 of one in the morning. 

Stage 1 calorie intake 1800-2000
Most days on a healthy deficit 300-500cals because i hit my proteins pretty well nowadays.
Training - gym sessions about 4-5 days a week. REVL training (just started this week), gym cardio, walk the dog 3-5ks each day on weekends - so pretty active.

Ive been very consistent that this is my new lifestyle and its good for me.

Can someone clarify to me what difference does it make if I up my dose to 5mg - is the food noise volume completely go down? What does it do?? Will it speed up my slow burning somehow?

Maybe Im fine. My goal is hopefully to get to 115kg in december for my trip back to the Philippines to be with family and christmas// new years and, still continuing it ofcourse. 

I don't expect this to be a speedy thing to change. Just curious and wanting some advice. 

No judgement responses please. Im trying to understand so I can adjust if I need to.

You know those “make money from your phone” ads? I always thought they were just total scams. Like, come on: who’s really making money by just tapping their screen?!  
Yeah, well, I’M EATING MY WORDS. Because yesterday, somehow, I pulled off a cool $100 IN. ONE. DAY. Literally just testing apps. I know how wild that sounds, but hear me out👇👇

**Here’s what went down:**

- Found this site: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** while doomscrolling (no, I’m NOT kidding).
- Skeptically filled in their quick form (preparing myself for nonsense, tbh).
- Boom, got a list of apps they WANT you to try—for actual, real money.
- They pay you for every app you test, sometimes even just for downloading and using it for a few minutes.

Honestly, I assumed it was going to be a bunch of outdated or spammy apps. Nope. Some were legit cool and a couple even stuck on my phone after the test, no exaggeration.

But what blew my mind? The payouts came FAST. I checked my PayPal and nearly spat my coffee:  
**$16 here, $14 there, $23 from another!**  
It all added up crazy quick and by dinner I had over $100. Let that sink in—I literally *paid* my grocery bill by chillin’ on my couch tapping through apps.

Here’s what shocked me most:

- I barely spent more than a couple hours, on and off.
- No weird “pre-payments” or shady stuff. Straight payment for your time.
- My actual feedback seemed to matter! Some devs even thanked me for catching bugs.
- There are NEW tests every day—so it’s not just a one-off hit.

If you’re skeptical? **Same, friend, same.**  
But now I feel like a fool for NOT trying it sooner.  
If you can use your phone, you can do this. No degree, no major setup. You just need a phone and like, average patience.

*Want in? Don’t sleep on this one.*

👉 Check it again here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Questions I kept getting from my DMs:

- Is it worldwide? Some apps are, some aren’t, but there’s stuff almost everywhere.
- Can you really cash out to PayPal? YEP. That’s how I got paid, and super fast.
- Does it dry up after one day? Not at all—**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** keeps refreshing the offers.

And it can ADD UP if you just do it a bit each day. Seriously, max chill money.

So for anyone on the fence, or desperately googling “How do I make money from home” (we’ve ALL been there)…  
This isn’t some get-rich-quick magic, but I’m honestly shocked at how easy it was to clear $100 without leaving my couch.

Ready to try? **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
(Let me know in the comments if you have Qs or want accountability!)

I can’t promise you’ll have a $100 day, but I can promise I was VERY wrong about these side hustles.

Let’s talk business automation—aka, the “That’s magic, right?” button for the modern workspace! Just think about it: by automating even a few tedious tasks, your day instantly gets lighter, your team starts smiling, and boom—innovation flows faster.

But what’s genuinely thrilling is how automation is shifting from boring macros in spreadsheets to **full-on AI-powered workflows** that transform entire departments. Imagine:

- Your customer support replies personalize themselves before you’ve even sipped your coffee.
- Finance reports assemble, polish, and send themselves, untouched by human hands.
- Marketing launches vibrant campaigns on social channels *instantly*, adapting messaging based on live engagement data!

I used to think automation was just about “making things a little easier.” Now, I see it’s about unlocking possibility. It’s about sparking joy (yeah, I went there, Marie Kondo fans) by letting people shed repetitive work so they can chase creativity, growth, and new opportunities.

What’s getting me especially amped:

- **Small teams suddenly punch above their weight.** You no longer need an army of staff to do big things—you just need smart automation.
- **Startups experiment more.** LESS time spent on tedious admin work = MORE time tweaking your product until it’s amazing.
- **Happy people, happy business!** Fewer boring chores means less burnout. That positive energy gets contagious.

My favorite “A-ha!” automation moment was connecting our CRM and internal chat. Suddenly, everyone got instant updates anytime a deal progressed. Excitement shot through the office—the salespeople cheered, and the support crew was ready to onboard before new clients could blink!

But hey, it isn’t just about cutting costs or going faster.

- It’s about reimagining what’s *possible* for you and your team.
- It’s about boosting morale because people feel supported, not replaced.
- It’s about scaling dreams, not just departments.

So what automation “lightbulb moments” have you had? What’s the one mind-numbing, soul-draining task you automated that made you want to fist-bump your computer screen?

Drop your wins, challenges, and “automation wish-lists” below! Let’s keep this excitement rolling and help each other turn more “what ifs” into “heck yes, we did it!”

(Hi, new writer here. I am needing writing friends who would like to swap our projects and give feedback!)

(Women’s contemporary fiction)

Three women have spent 11 years perfecting the art of ""everything's great!"" while secretly wondering if anyone else’s lives feel like they're being held together with coffee, dry shampoo, and sheer determination. Amara has become the Pinterest-perfect mom who's quietly losing herself somewhere between organic snacks and color-coded schedules. Reese projects unshakeable confidence while hiding the fact that the untold truths of her past nearly broke her. Lainey is the sweet, accommodating friend who's been slowly suffocating in a life that looks good on paper but feels wrong in her bones.

They make an attempt to reconnect through a long overdue mom trip to Costa Rica. What starts as much-needed girl’s vacation, becomes an unexpected reckoning. Somewhere between the poolside laughs, and late-night conversations, the carefully constructed versions of themselves start to crack. Years of ""I'm fine"" crumble under the weight of what they've actually been carrying. They've all been drowning in different ways, just really quietly, while maintaining flawless appearances.

This is what happens when women finally stop performing their lives and start living them—embracing the ugly crying, uncomfortable truths, and the kind of friendships that can handle both your worst moments and your most unhinged 2AM thoughts. It's about learning that the strongest foundations aren't built on perfection, but on the courage to be authentically, unapologetically human with the people who matter most.

A big help was our Renogy ShadowFlux panel, it's worked really well in the shade.

How’s the 4Runner: Toyota is incredible. A few oil changes and a small $200 repair (self-inflicted), otherwise really no issues.

1n3mh15,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1n3mh15/bc_tenant_advice_mattress_left_behind_by_old/,BC Tenant Advice - Mattress left behind by old tenant,"Hello, I’m currently renting a unit in New Westminster BC with my partner. We’ve been renting since August 2023.

Essentially, our landlord is holding us responsible for disposing of a mattress that was never our property, but was abandoned by a previous tenant. Can he claim that it’s our property and withhold part of our deposit for “removal fees”?

When we moved in, the previous tenant (tenant 1) let us know that his old furniture (a couch, tv stand, table and chairs, and coffee table) would be ours to keep. He made it clear it was not the property of our landlord, but that it was ours now.

Also with the unit came a mattress, box springs, and frame left behind by a separate tenant (tenant 2) who did not specify it was ours to keep. It was stained in various places, and despite considering buying our own mattress, we decided to use it until it was claimed by the rightful owner or until we moved out.

We are now moving out. We booked the building elevator for today at 9am to move/sell the furniture that tenant 1 left for us. We considered moving out the mattress since it was never claimed, but decided against it since we can only book the elevator for weekdays (either today or Tuesday the 2nd) and we would not have a place to sleep tonight (we don’t have the keys to our new place til tomorrow, Saturday the 30th). Not to mention, the mattress was never really ours.

When our landlord came to see how the furniture move-out was going, he asked why we didn’t take the mattress. We informed him that if he didn’t want the mattress, we could move it out over the long weekend without booking the elevator. As it turns out, the Strata laws will not allow us to move the mattress without booking the elevator. Therefore, we’d rather leave the abandoned mattress, and purchase a new one for our new place.

We are now arguing with our landlord. He insists the mattress was part of the belongings inherited by us from tenant 1. We keep explaining that tenant 1 never gave us that mattress, that it’s abandoned property by tenant 2. 

Landlord insists it’s our property and our responsibility to remove it. We insist it’s abandoned property and his responsibility to get rid of it. 

We make no claim to that mattress. It should have been removed when tenant 2 moved out in the first place. It was left behind and we used it with the understanding that it was not ours to keep.

It’s my understanding that the landlord is responsible for removal of property that is unclaimed at the end of a tenancy (or otherwise abandoned property). Is this correct? Can our landlord withhold part of our deposit claiming “mattress removal fees”? He admits that we didn’t purchase the mattress, that it was left behind by a previous tenant, but he keeps insisting it’s our property and our responsibility. I’m honestly at a loss right now.

I've been taking the 10 mg for 4 weeks, transitioning from 5mg. After upping the medication the only initial side effect I had was dry mouth and sweating. Yesterday I woke up feeling like my insides were tremoring. The feeling lasted all day and felt like I had slight increase of shaking when performing intentional movements like writing or reaching for things. Last night I was having increased shakiness in my legs where it was difficult to walk. When I would stand my knees would tremble like I was shivering, increased restless leg symptoms, and felt like my brain was Fuzzy/tingling. Had a very difficult time sleep. ( before Thursday the medication seemed to be helping me fall asleep)

After taking my medication my stomach was upset so I threw up. This morning I still feel internally shivering.

I've had no change in diet, change in medicine, or use of essential oils. I was able to drink 1-2 cups of coffee without issues. I recently had a lot of stressors resolve. 

Initially it felt like the medication had been helping (it made me feel like i  did prebaby), But now I feel worse. (Upset stomach,  tremoring,  head/ body Fuzzy feeling,  restless leg symptoms). 

I've already reached out to the psychiatrist. He proposed trying to push through if I could,  but to call the office if it continues to be unbearable.

did anyone else have similar experiences?

***USS Savannah*****, Mess Hall, 1:15 pm, Nov 3rd, 2025**

The mess hall of the *Savannah* was peaceful, but not quiet. Kitchen staff are finishing the final preparations on their dishes. With the importance of first impressions, they were given access to the highest quality ingredients for the trip over. So to say that everything the crew ate during the two days on the water was fantastic would be an understatement.

Steel tables and chairs occupied the decently sliced hall. Around ten to fifteen at a table. Drink machines and coffee dispensers with a generous selection lined one wall, accompanied by condiments and silverware for food. In the cornermost table, sit two men, and what appears to be a small animal sleeping on a chair. A soft blanket rested for the creature so it would not get cold from the steel.

Hunched over, back turned towards the entrance. Leon “Orfevre” Müller, a Swiss-born, was tall, long-faced, fair-skinned, blonde-haired. His green eyes focused on the golden ring he was finalizing the detail on. A gift for the lady of Golden Keep. Not knowing who occupied the castle from the drone missions, it was decided on a simple flower shape, encrusted in red gems. It was the reason why he was brought on the expedition in the first place, to help impress the Lannister nobles using his goldsmithing skills that earned Leon not only his nickname within the RGM, but also friends in the high strata of society who made up a large part of his clientele.

The sleeping creature gives out a sharp yawn, almost like a *yip,* as it stretches. Causing Leon to lose concentration and almost scratch the inside of the freshly polished ring. “Scheiße!” Looking closer with an eyepiece, he sighed in relief that he hadn't scratched the ring; he straightened himself. “Who even let this mutt on this ship anyway?”

“The ‘mutt’ has a name, you know.” Suddenly, said the man in front of him, who paid no mind to the noise. He’s calmly cleaning his rifle, the Barrett MRAD, or known by its military designation, the Mk. 22, which was known for its quick caliber conversion capability between 7.62mm, .300 Norma Magnum, and .338 Norma Magnum.

“Whoa! Since when have you been here!? Oh, verdammt!” Leon was so shocked at the person in front of him that he actually scratched the ring this time, and it just gave him an extra hour of work, much to his chagrin.

“Fifteen minutes ago, you horse-face! We have known each other for a while, and you still acted like this. Am I really that subtle to you!?” The young man answered in exasperation.

“Yes Daisuke, yes you are, ya Fuchs!,” his heavy Swiss accent flowed with each word, “You know, I still don’t get why they let you keep… Ugh, what’s this cheems’ name again?” He watched as the Marine, well, basically a young man, stopped his cleaning, looking up at him with his intense amber eyes. He then looked at the animal he was referencing. A light Shiba dog lay next to him, nibbling at one of its toes. Its hair shines in the fluorescent light.

“Aki? What about him?” The young man scratched behind the small dog’s ear. Getting a smile from the animal.

“What about him? He’s a dog that acts like a cat on a ship, belonging to a Marine. That doesn't make any sense.”

Frowning, “He belongs to me, yes, but he is also a part of the company. Like a mascot, who just so happens to take good care of him. It's not my fault that he only likes me. Besides, he's like my little brother.”

“A little brother that can kill a man in five. No, six different ways, Fuchs.” Leon rebuttals, pointing one of his tools towards him.

Daisuke just shrugged and went back to his rifle. “And who do you think trained him, horse-face?” Daisuke hummed with a smile as Leon was annoyed by another nickname of his.

Once finished, he locked the rifle back in its case. Sitting there, drinking a cup of hot Dr. Pepper with lemon, a habit that he inherited from his grandfather, who came to the United States in the early to late 1960s. “I saw it in a magazine ad that your grandmother liked to read. It is surprisingly good.” He told Daisuke as a boy one winter.

The door to the mess opened, letting Commander Choi and Staff Sergeant Jeremy lead the Westermen nobles inside. The mouthwatering smell of the cooking food was the first thing to hit their noses with a ***WHAM***. *Sniff sniff* *sniff Sniff* “My word. What is that delicious smell?” One lord proclaimed to no one in particular.

*Sniff* “It's meat, but I have never smelt such an aroma before.”

“It's heavenly!""

Taking those comments as his cue to speak, Jeremy explained how to order the food they so wished to desire. Of course, one of them asked where they could get more of those “Coca-Cola”. Jeremy pointed to the soda machine and explained how it operates and the variety of drinks it dispenses. He had to block them and explain that first they must order their food. So each grabbed a large tray that had built-in bowls and made an orderly line.

The head cook walked around the counter, “Hello, everyone. I am Culinary Specialist 1st Class Reginald Cosmo; you can just call me “Reggy” for short. Everyone does it.”

After introductions, the cook lists off their choices of food with their basic ingredients from left to right. “For lunch today, we have a hamburger with your choice of basic toppings such as cheese. You can get a side of fries or a fruit cup. Next is an oven-cooked pizza with either just cheese or pepperoni. We also have a vegetarian option for those who don’t eat meat. Which is a Lintel Soup with bread. And lastly, a loaded baked potato with your choice of toppings.”

“And for dessert, we have a cake from Mississippi called ‘Mud Cake’, freshly made, and Ice Cream. Any questions?” But none came; their eyes were on the heavenly-looking food. The lights just above it all were a hue of yellow, making each item glow and glisten. As if the Crone herself guided their eyes to it.

“May we try them all, if we so wish?” The young Ser Jace questioned, keeping his eyes on the food. Not trying to be rude, but the smell was pulling them in their direction. All Jeremy had to do was say one, single, word.

“Yes”

*I’m amazed they haven’t tried to climb over the counter yet. Guess they still have dignity that needs to be kept.* Both Leon and Daisuke watched as the nobles, clearly with quite a bit of effort, tried not to do such a thing. Several lined up in an orderly fashion, while others found seats close by. None of them had noticed the two men in the corner, or did for Daisuke and didn’t care for Leon.

“How goes the ring and watches, Leon?” The Commander questioned, who turns out can walk surprisingly quiet when she wants to. Startling the two from watching the cackling hens go out on both the Staff Sergeant and Culinary Specialist, with Daisuke in particular immediately standing up and greeting her with a salute. “Commander Choi!”

The navy commander visibly flinched at Daisuke’s greeting and salute as she just noticed that he was also in the cabin. “You know, Corporal Fox, I can’t get really used to how subtle you are despite it’s literally part of your job.” She then turned to Leon again. “But in any case, how is the progress, Leon?”

“So weit, ist es gut. But I have to restart on the inner ring because of. Well, them.” Leon points to Daisuke and the Shiba, the latter now awake with wandering eyes that you could fall in love with.

Daisuke just rolled his eyes at the jab, “You were being too loud, horse-face.” He then turned to the navy commander. “How’s the tour party going so far, Commander Choi?” She went on to explain the previous transpired events, skimming over the interaction with Shino. She sat next to Aki and scratched behind his ears. Daisuke had warned everyone who tried to do so that he doesn't really let strangers do that. But the Commander had been one of the few on the ship he’d allow touching him.

*15 Minutes pass*

The Highborn Westerosi quickly figured out the meal selection process and acclimated. Several split drinks on the floor, prompting one of the sailors to clean it up. In turn, showing them something called a “Swiffer”, and how quickly it cleaned up the spillage.

Each Westerosi chose a, well, “variety” of food, you could say. Some have two trays. The smell and heat of each make it irresistible not to do so. Before they could dig in and eat, “My Lords! First, we must pray to the Seven for this bountiful meal. And thank our hosts for allowing us to enjoy the fruits of their labour. Let us pray.”

An older lord, about fifty to sixty years old, stood up holding a book that he brought along with him. The cover had a seven-pointed star embroidered with gold. He wore robes in the colour of his house. The centerpiece of the outfit was a large, gold, seven-pointed star hanging from a chain around his neck. Flipping the book open, and began to read.

“Blessed be the Mother, for today we eat a bountiful feast from our, hopefully, new friends across the Sunset Sea. And blessed be the Smith, for guiding the farmers in the hard work that brings this feast to the table. We bless the Crone to guide our Liege lord, Lord Tywin Lannister, and the ambassador, Lady Kelly O’Conner, to light their path towards friendship. And lastly, may the Father judge the United States of America and the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. That we both can move forward into a prosperous future.”

“And now, let us enjoy the fruits of their labour.” *Thump.* The book is closed, and they all take their first bites of food. With their bites taken, there is silence among the highborn. You could almost see the gears turning in their heads. The taste buds soaking up the richness of the meal.

“It’s heavenly!” Ser Jace exclaims as he throws away his Highborn manners and goes to town on the ‘Bacon Cheese Burger’ he decided to try. It was as if the years of Court training and Septon manners had vanished in a puff of smoke, each one embracing the food, like a beach with the tide.

With each massive bit being taken, the questions double.

“How is this” *munch* “bread so” *slurp* “soft? It's nothing like anything I have ever tasted.”

“How are you able to acquire such exotic fruits? I have only read about ‘Pineapples’ in books! I never knew they tasted so delicious.”

“This dessert… Ice Cream. How do you make it in the summer? The last time I had something similar was frozen ice during the False Spring. And not as rich and creamy. I must know how. Lannisport would be the perfect place to sell it and make a profit!”

“Staff Sergeant,” Ser Jace had finished his burger and now had something called ‘French Fries’ left. “What exactly are these again?”

Jeremy noticed that out of all the nobles, he was the only one to have fries on his tray. None of them even got the baked potato either. “These are French Fries, you make them from potatoes by cutting them into those sticks and frying them in vegetable oil.” The nobles were silent. “What? Have none of you heard of a ‘Potato?’ ”

To his, and well, everyone's surprise, they all shook their heads. None of them had heard the word ‘Potato’ before. Which is strange because the booklets said that potatoes were mentioned in the TV show, but not in the books. *Just mentioned a few short times. How could something so simple yet so important not exist? I guess the butterfly effect is in full swing now.*

“Try it and tell me what you think?”

Ser Jace inspected it further, seeing the white flecks of salt coated evenly on the golden coloured stick. It smelled nice with steam softly rising off it. Tearing it in two and eating one made up his mind on this ‘Potato’. The taste made him smile; it was salty, buttery, and with a hint of oil. It was nothing like he had tasted before in his life. He ate the other half, then another, and another. Before he knew it, he had eaten them all from his tray. “May I try the ‘Baked Potato’?” There were bits of salt on the sides of his mouth.

“Sure, go nuts.” He watched as the knight got up with his tray and picked out the biggest, thickest foil-wrapped potato. The cook gave him topping recommendations. The foil was cut, and the potato was stuffed. When Ser Jace sat back at the table, the highborn looked in wonder at this ‘Potato’. *It’s massive*.

The potato was about the length of the tip of his middle finger to his wrist. Plus an inch or so, and as wide as his hand. One thing they noted was the outside of it. Brown like dirt, an uneven surface, and humps spread randomly. It almost looked like a failed clay vase that was split in two.

Its filling, which you could call more of a topping, was cheese, butter, and small pieces of bacon. And something called ‘sour cream’, which looks to just be a white cream, but sour?

The smell of this strange dish was nothing Jace had smelt before, not even at sword point; he couldn’t describe it. Making sure he got a taste of everything, he evenly scooped the contents on his spoon and ate. His eyes lit up, shining like a starry night.

The next minutes became a blur for Jace as he ate his meal. Each bite tasted better than the last. When one of his fellow nobles asked how it was, the only word that came to him was “heavenly”. Not wanting to miss out on eating something ‘heavenly’, a lord here and there went to get and try this ‘potato’ meal.

***USS Savannah*****, Mission Bay, Storage**

Meanwhile, Shino is giving a tour of the MLQ she and a few of the other Staff NCOs had bunked in during their time on the *Savannah*. Besides the beds, the noble ladies had picked up with the introduction of the shower. *Hot water? At the turn of a nob? And no need to wait for wooden tubs?*

“I don’t see how servants are able to help with this. Do they join you in this ‘Shower’?” Lady Mera examined the deeply stained glass concealing the interior of the shower.

“I mean… There are bigger showers than this, but normally, you would clean yourself. I don’t know anyone who has servants clean themselves, unless you count parents cleaning their children.”

“No Servants? I presumed that, with such luxuries, even your smallfolk would have servants.” The young, and VERY tween personality, Lady Jocelyn commented with highborn pride. She sat on one of the beds, enjoying the springiness of the mattress. Clearly, she loved the fact that she was still at the top of the food chain. At least, to her knowledge anyway.

Shino mentally rolled her eyes and herded them along out of the MLQ. Making their way to the sectioned off area between the machine shop and dinghy, loading and unloading. Quad Conns, basically small storage containers, some are skinny and tall, around 6 and a half feet tall. Others are squat and small, appearing like an office supply box.

One thing in common was the MasterLocks on their sides, chaining their contents like a rabid beast. Three Marines guarded their contents, enhancing the Westerosi women’s curiosity.

“Normally, there wouldn’t be any guards. But when the Captain found out that there was going to be a tour. He decided not to take any chances with the container's contents being so. Well. ‘Open’.” Shino explained to the ladies as she showed her ID to the guards of Marine corporals, dismissing them with a wave. “We got it covered here.”

“Staff Sergeant, are you sure? I mean, with what’s in the containers, and them being... Well.” One Marine, a young man about the same height as Shino, whispered questioningly with eyes moving to the women behind her. However, the Staff Sergeant’s sharp stare silenced any further questions. Nodding, the three Corporals then chose to leave to get some fresh air outside rather than dealing with the Marine who, in addition to “Muscle Cow”, also got the nickname “Gentildonna” in Okinawa after she defeated three male JSDF soldiers larger than her in arm wrestling matches.

Shino started to fiddle with one of the tall containers with a key Commander Choi gave her, “Now, you’re all probably wondering why these containers specifically are guarded. Well, simply put, their contents are likely worth more than your weight in precious metals.”

“You mean, more than even gold?”

“Yes, exactly. Tell me, do you have people who make your dresses?”

The women looked at their dresses in confusion, as if the answer should be obvious, but answered with a nod regardless.

“Not surprising, but as a gesture of friendship, the US Government has a gift for the Highborn Ladies of Lannisport. So, ladies.” With a click, the lock came off, allowing Shino to swing the double doors on the container wide open. “Please, choose a dress of your choice.”

The container had a light system to illuminate its contents. The doors had built-in mirrors to examine the dresses closely. And its contents were like the garments from the heavens.

***USS Savannah*****, Mess Hall, 1:45 pm, Nov 3rd, 2025**

Upon finishing his talk with Captain Anderson, Captain Green made his way to the Mess Hall to take Staff Sergeant Moore up on the Mud Cake that he promised to save. The door leading in was under guard by a Marine Pvt who noticed his massive bulk coming down the hallway. He gave a salute and gave him room through the door.

The highborn nobles were a sight to see, clearly satisfied with their feast. It took a minute for one booming voice to greet him, “Ah, Captain Green, it is splendid to see you. Please, join us. I have so many questions for you.” The large man was Ser Lyle Crakehall. Just by seeing him, Green can already guess why he was called the “Strongboar”. He is also the husband of the woman who Pvt. Webber was trying to get the harness on, something that drew some curiosity due to the books not establishing him as a married man. Come to think of it, Green didn’t see her with her husband. Actually, four others were missing as well, from what the Captain could see.

The other nobles gave him their most proper greeting, at least as much as they could muster, since the food they had just eaten minutes ago was still settling in their stomachs. A few just grunting.

Green gave Moore a gesture to one of the empty tables, making his way over, after getting two big glasses of milk for both of them. After excusing himself, Moore made his way over to the Captain. After getting two pieces of ‘Mud Cake’ for both of them. Leaving the high lords to chat amongst themselves till Commander Choi went over to answer their questions.

Jeremy took his seat in front of the captain, sliding a big piece of cake and a spoon over to him. “So… What does Captain Anderson have to say, sir?” He softly asked, taking one of the glasses of milk and scooping some of the cake.

“Do you want the simple answer, or the long, bureaucratic, authorized eyes only one that I can tiptoe around vaguely?""

“I guess the simple answer first.”

“Did you see the paint on Harpy 3?”

“No, why?”

Jabari pulled his phone out and showed Jeremy a picture of said paint. He stared, the desert halfway in his mouth, before his eyes went wide and back to him. *You’re kidding, right?* It was the only look he gave him.

He just shook his head and put the phone back into his breast pocket. “No, I am not. Turns out, orders came to paint it just a few hours before the pick-up. They used hair dryers to speed up the process. The Captain seemed like he was surprised when he found out as well. You wanna know what the last thing he could tell me was?”

“Yeah.”

“Langley."" Captain Green stated simply.

Jeremy raised an eyebrow. “So… They're already involved here then. Any ideas, sir?” Jabari just shrugged and went back to the dessert in front of him. Jeremy’s mind raced as he slowly ate. He should have seen the CIA’s involvement coming..

Rumors had spread throughout the military about the three main intelligence agencies: CIA, FBI, and NSA. While the CIA is already given and the NSA has been experiencing a significant budget and personnel slash, the FBI is currently handling internal security affairs, from violent anarchists to organized crime. For the latter, in addition to Operation Decisive Dawn with the DEA that led to the collapse of many Mexican cartels’ Fentanyl operations, the Bureau is also cracking down on the dwindling Russian and Chinese organized crimes, who also lost contact with their homelands. However, there are some fears that domestic-based crime groups would soon fill the power vacuum left by their international competitors.

Additionally, there is also a more ‘nobler’ task given to them; The dismantling of domestic extremists intended to take advantage of the post-Transfer chaos, from the emerging such as the far-right National Defense Front in South Carolina and the radical left People’s Revolutionary Army in Wisconsin, to the established ones like the Proud Boys and Antifas who hate each other as much as they hate a stable government. There are also news about a standoff in western Montana involving an armed cult calling itself the Legion of God against the FBI and Montana National Guard, as well as the declaration by the former US cell of the Animal Liberation Front, now reformed as the American Wildlife Brigade (AWB), who vowed to intervene against any actions by the USFWS that were deemed as “harmful” to the new wildlife beyond the borders.

Jeremy was going to bring up some New KKK clownery in Alabama to lighten the mood a little, until a booming voice interrupted him again. Booted feet thumped close by, belonging to a man of high stature.

“Ah, our new friends from beyond the Sunset Sea! So glad to have you two with us! I had wished to compliment you, but I know when commanders in arms need a word in private. I must say, this is a fine feast that your cook served us. Perhaps, if he’s not part of your fleet, I would have snatched him to Crakehall already. HAHAHAHA!” The large knight boisterously slapped Jeremy's shoulder.

“It’s our pleasure, Ser Lyle,” Jeremy responded.

Ser Lyle wiped soda remnants off his beard, “But I have a question if I may ask, your people called your realm ‘The United States of America’, but what does it mean exactly? I understand that the ""America"" part was the name of your land, as is Westeros to us, but what exactly does ""United States"" mean? Perhaps your ""states"" are like a kingdom to us?""

Captain Green then takes a sip from his milk “Well, that’s more or less the case. Putting it in a way, Ser Lyle, just like the Seven Kingdoms made up of lords and their domains, our country is bound together by fifty states . Each of these states have their own authority, cultures, laws, and such, but all still owe fealty to the greater authority in our capital, our own King’s Landing basically.”

“Fifty!? And they also have their own rulers and laws!? Dear gods, and I here I thought the Seven Kingdoms were already a pain in the arse just by itself. Your people must quarrel a lot with that kind of division.”

“Oh, tell me about it, good ser,” Jeremy said in a mirthless laugh as he took a sip of his milk. “But in the end, despite all of our differences, or even because of it, we all still consider ourselves Americans at heart, and that’s what really matters.”

“I reckon that your people also have to go through massive bloodshed for that to happen, just like when we toppled those sisterfuckers from the Iron Throne,” The large man guessed.

“Oh, there sure was, in fact, our country almost split into two at once. During the Civil War, the issue of slavery divided us. Northern states, or ‘The Union’ as historians like to call them, while it's simply the US, most saw it as an economic issue before it became a moral one, while the southern states, their piss-ant rebellion called themselves ‘The Confederate States of America’ or ‘The Confederates’ by the Union. They were states that were economically dependent upon it.”

At the mention of slavery, the boar spits to the deck, “Bah! Slavery, the most vile of all sins. Please tell me that the one against it actually won and it has been eradicated, otherwise… we’re going to have a real problem.” The Crakehall knight practically growled.

“Don’t worry, Ser Lyle. We, the side against slavery won. I’ll go into more detail.” Jeremy then made himself more comfortable then continued. “Our leader at the time was Abraham Lincoln, who at first only wanted to stop the spread of slavery in hopes that it would die out. However, the South forced him by attacking a fort. Thus, the country was plunged into civil war, and almost a million men fought and died in four years, maybe even more. Son against son, brother against brother.” Jeremy knew that a good portion of those who died were from disease, but he figured the lord probably knew that.

“Almost a million men… In four years no less.” The large man's face strained in thought, “I am trying to picture it, but such bloodshed is unthinkable to me. I don’t consider myself well-read… but in all the histories of our wars, even before Aegon's Conquest. I do not believe such a number was reached, not even a tenth.”

“Neither for me, as well.” Jeremy had seen enough bloodshed in his time, but just like the towering man in front of him. None like that. “But in the end, it was that bloodshed that cleaned the sin of slavery that has stained our nation, a nation that should have been a shining beacon of freedom and liberty. And we will never forget those who were held in bondage.”

“Ah, good riddance, I say, that barbaric practice has been abolished from your realm. This Abraham Lincoln lad must be one of your greatest leaders, by the way you talked about him.” Ser Lyle said in satisfaction

“He sure was.” Captain Green said. “In the aftermath of a bloody battlefield called Gettysburg, he was there in person when the Soldiers’ National Cemetery was consecrated to those who died in that battle. In a short 2-minute speech, he masterfully iterated our nation’s purpose and our need to continue the fight, especially after such a costly battle.”

The boar and the other nobles listened to the history of the US Civil War and its high cost, which made the War of the Ninepenny Kings look insignificant. The other nobles moved to hear the two men speak, a few standing. One such being a young knight.

“What did he say to rally his people to continue the fight?” Ser Jace asked.

Jeremy pulled a folded sheet of white paper from his pocket. He knew that the nobles would poke and prod into their history. And just to be sure, he had his favorite and most important speeches written down. “What he wrote down and said word for word is as follows: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal….”

Ser Jace sat and listened with his fellow Westermen nobles as Jeremy read word for word. The young man couldn’t help but think back to what his father told him about the Greyjoy Rebellion. During his march to the Iron Islands, King Robert Baratheon would rally every bannerman he met on the way with rousing speeches. With his imposing charisma and booming voice, thousands of men flocked under his command, be it Stormlanders, Westermen, Rivermen, and even Northmen. And that’s not even mentioning how he took the crown from the Mad King and the Dragon Prince.

From Summerhall to the Pyke. From the Mad King to the Wet King. No matter what the battlefield or the war, the Rebel turned King Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, would rally everyone to fight beside him. This Abraham Lincoln appeared to be the same, but this man seemed to have a gentle but firm touch with his words.

“-we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

The nobles gathered to listen to the Captain, who recited the speech given on that solemn day centuries ago. “Truly, words to ease the hearts of a weary people in a time of great sorrow. I’d reckon you keep the speech close to you?” Ser Jace said, breaking the silence. Jeremy just nodded and folded the paper back into his packet.

Captain Green looked at the young knight. “In a time of strife that is civil war, where brother fights against brother, it takes such great men like Lincoln to stitch the wounds that have caused such a split. Both as a nation and to someone he didn’t even know.”

Lord Crakehall looked at him with an inquisitive look. “What do you mean by that?” But before Captain Green could answer the lord's question, the door leading to the Mess Hall came creaking open.

With a booming voice, “Gods be good! My dearest Daisy, is that you?” Ser Crakehall broke the silence and was now looking towards the door with wide eyes. Everyone turned to see six figures, two of which were Marines. Shino and another woman both seemed very pleased with their work.

Ser Lyle stood in awe of his recently married lady. She seemed to glow in her strange, but beautiful dress. The main colours were white, black, and brown, with what appeared to be the Reach’s green scarf draped around her shoulders. Her arms were bare for all to see, except for her shoulders. The collar was cut in a V shape from her neck to her breast. Buttons made of what appeared to be bronze ran from the V’s point down to her waist, where a brown belt wrapped around. It held her dirk that he had given to her as a wedding gift.

Pieces of metal in the shape of teardrops hung from her ears, with each movement catching the light. More of her garments shone in the same way. Her shoes seem to be another type of dark brown. Though the material seemed to be leather, with a gold buckle facing outward.

Daisy walked to her husband and curtsied, “My Lord Husband, I hope this gown is to your liking. It is a gift from the Americans, not that the other wasn't fantastic.”

“My Dearest Lady… It is beautiful.” He stood there basking in her beauty. All the while, the other nobles admired the other three ladies' new dresses. And hers, of course.

Marla Brax insisted on wearing her house colours of purple and silver. And there just so happened to be one. Silked in the colour of plum that had been enhanced to give a purple shade that just happened to match the unicorn on her coat of arms. The sleeves were stitched and encrusted with silver stones. The dress curved and melted to her body. The noble ladies gawked in awe at the colour alone. Only a few noble houses had the privilege to have even a sliver of purple, a color that can only be created by harvesting rare sea snails that can only be found in Tyrosh, so this was mind-blowing. *The gods themselves must have made this dress.*

The lady, Mera Estern, wore something more modest for a more mature woman. The dress was green and white, the design matched her previous one, but lighter and smoother. She wore earrings of birds that had been handcrafted in Italy. She had to concentrate on not falling because of the heels she decided to try.

She was accompanied by Mary and Jocelyn. Both wore similar dresses, each designed for women their age. Mary with her black and yellow over-kneed-length dress. She wore the same shoes because she was not fond of any of they had. Jocelyn did as well, but Shino figured it she was copying Mary.

Her black and grey dress had to be held together with safety pins. She was very skinny for her age. Shino had questioned her on it and got an answer she didn’t like. “Every woman from our house is small, but eventually well-gifted like you, my lady.” Something she thought would have to be brought up with her father and mother.

After the other nobles did their ‘inspection’, the five ladies had their chance to try the food they could smell from down the hall. After the meal, the Commander and Staff Sergeants(s) answered and asked many questions of the Nobles to pry as much information as they possibly could.

Daisuke was listening intently before he noticed that two of the ladies stopped and seemingly looked at him with great interest. But he knows that they’re not looking at him, but the fluffball now standing next to him. Front paws on the table and yipped twice. Once out of curiosity, and the second for attention. He didn’t notice it because the noise sometimes melted into the background.

With a screech of teenagers’ joy, Mary and Jocelyn practically leaped over the table to see the fluffy creature. The other nobles walked over with ‘grace’ to see it as well. They never noticed the dog because it was hidden next to Daisuke and lying on the chair.

The two girls rapidly exclaim. “My gods, what is that beautiful creature? Woulditbite? Wherediditcamefrom?” The words were a chaotic jumble; he could barely understand them, sounds made by teens punched by love.

“Uhh, excuse me, my ladies, this is Aki, and he’s my dog.” Daisuke greeted the ladies, which made them recoil in surprise from his sudden appearance.

“Ah… our sincerest apologies, my good ser. We didn’t see you there.” The older girl apologized in embarrassment before asking, ""What kind of dog is he, and can we pet him, if I may ask?”

“He’s a Shiba Inu dog breed. I got it from a country called Japan. He doesn’t bite, and you can pet him.” He figured it would be best to just answer them, or they might do something to him. As if on cue, Aki hopped up on the table and sat on the edge with elegance.

Mary and Jocelyn's eyes were wide and full of curiosity. The younger began to pet Aki, first slowly, then faster. Daisuke always groomed him after breakfast and made sure to shower him as well. Good thing too, his fur was nice and soft.

Eventually, the other nobles got their turn to pet the creature and ask questions. It appeared to Daisuke that Aki made sure to capture the moment by sprawling on the table for enough hands to have equal surface area to scratch him, clearly enjoying it. He then felt a tap on his shoulder; it was the older of the two girls.

“Forgive me, ser, but I never asked your name. I am Mary, of House Drox.” The girl, or lady in this case, curtsied with noble elegance. The younger one was still occupied with Aki, never wasting eyeball time away from the animal.

“Pleasure to meet you, Lady Drox. My name is Corporal Daisuke Fox, Ma’am. How can I help you?” The lady’s eyes briefly lit up when she heard his surname.

“I just wanted to inquire about your fluffy animal and yourself, if I may. I have so many questions.”

“Of course, I will try to answer to the best of my abilities.”

They both talked for some time, well, it was mainly Mary doing the talking and Daisuke giving answers that led her to ask more questions. His family, his job, where he grew up, his education, his training, and life in America. He ended up going into detail about each. She would just sit and listen. Before long, some other nobles joined in, too. Soon, Daisuke was leading the Q&A that was set to begin instead of Commander Choi.

He was drinking when Mary asked another one, which in turn made him nearly choke on it. *cough cough cough.* “Pardon me, my lady, but can you say that again. I don’t think I heard you right.”

“I asked if you were engaged. Because if you are not, I would like to be with you to join our house with yours.” She said again, with a tinge of annoyance on her face.

*Shit. I figured I heard that right*. He had to think fast to get out of this conversation. She was clearly a teenager, for god’s sake. Westerosi customs were completely different from the US, yes. But he also didn’t want to be rude. Some of the lords started to get a twinkle in their eyes; most likely, they had daughters who needed husbands. And what a perfect time to bring it up, especially with a clearly powerful potential ally to the Lannisters. With how they refer to him as ‘ser’, they must have thought of him as a knight of a noble house.

“I am afraid that would not be possible, Lady Drox.” It was Commander Choi! *My lifeline!* Daisuke internally screamed for joy at the XO stepping in.

“And why is that, Commander Choi? We're both fully grown, I am a flowered woman of six and ten years. And he must be eight and ten years of age. Highborn families form marriage alliances much earlier, nine times out of ten. If anything, I am past due for marriage. But my Lord Father has said he wants to give me away to someone with honor. I think Ser Daisuke is a perfect fit, no?”

“Well, that's where you're wrong, Mary. To put it clearly, Sergeant Fox here is two and twenty years old. And it is mostly against our laws for anyone under ten and eight to get married. Especially, a six and ten-year-old to marry a two and ten-year-old. Sorry.” The Commander dropped the formalities in addressing her to get the message through.

This new bit of information surprised the highborn, especially Jocelyn, visibly. Clearly wanting to do something similar to one of the servicemen for her house. This leads them into explaining the laws of: Age of consent, marriage laws, child labour, and many more for those under the age of eighteen years old.

**Dusk, Lannisport**

Ser Jace made his way down the ramp with much on his mind, carrying something called a ‘Goodie bag’. When it was given to him, he’d been told not to open it till he returned to his chambers. Which he found odd, but since everyone got one, it seemed like a welcoming gift. Which was nice for them to do such a jest.

He looked over to the canopy that Lord Tywin was led to at midday. He, his brother, cousin, and the Maester were given much bigger bags as well.

He noticed something else as well, strange sounds coming from the town square. And what appeared to be white lights. Intrigued, he made his way there. It was the way to where he was sleeping for the night, so it was convenient.

He passed by Lady Mary and Lady Jocelyn, who were snickering amongst themselves. He only heard a little, but it had something to do with the topic of betrothals.

1n3m2ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n3m2ny/15_year_relationship_down_the_drain/,15 year relationship down the drain….,"I 36m have been in a relationship with her 45f for 15 years.

We have had our ups and downs, discussion were normal as we set boundaries and such, they became rare over the years, but this last year has been weird. 

We had more discussion than often almost every week, but smoothen things out, now she has a group of coworkers  who became a group  and started hanging out, making plans to go out and such. Was totally fine with it as all seemed normal, then it was to go out and eat, fine with it as well, them meeting for coffees but only 2 coworkers, then it was only one. This last one so happens to live on the way to our place and asked for a ride. I was fine with that too, carpooling is normal. 

Then all of a sudden they made plans to go rollerblading together. Just the two of them, At this point i was no longer comfortable as this is something we used to do together and she has been against doing it with me for a while, and what we dis on our first date. 

I sat with her explained how i felt and how it bothered me, that this would open doors to many other things and she ended up getting super offended as she expressed it but agreed she wouldn’t go.

3 weeks go by and as I walked in she was sitting on the couch and told me
Im going rollerblading, and im
Going with that guy, whether you like it or not, think what you want. 

I expressed frustration again as i was
Off and something we could easily do together. But she went on.

She so happened to have an accident and mentioned i should be thankful for him being there, i was obviously even more upset. 

Since then i had one more conversation where she blamed me
For not knowing what i wanted with our relationship, i explained to her i loved her but i was not being respected, feel absolutely replaced, all she wants is me to change but she isn’t willing to change a thing, it tried keeping my mouth shout since, dry, barely talk, treat her just like she treats me, hasn’t said i love since the day it happened, so havent said it back either. 

A few days after that the “group”
met, but she failed the details that it was at his place as i asked wtf was
she and sent a screenshot of her location…. 


A few days ago she asked if i had accessed the phone carrier account, i explained i didn’t but made me very curious, the very next day, went right into it and saw the usage and her amount of minutes was insane compared to mine, so dug deeper…

Come to find out she has been on the phone with a particular number in the last 60 days, first month 530 minutes, now this most recent month 1090 minutes, so did a research and boom dudes name. 

Now since last weekend not a single minute…. 

She doesn’t know i know this and haven’t shared it but have screenshots and all. 

For no Fucking reason should any girl be talking with her “coworker” for that amount of minutes,  am i the asshole here??? 

Am i wrong here? 

Planning a smooth exit asap so will keep you posted….

I'm (31, F) a FTM, to a freshly-turned 8 week old girl, who is absolutely the light of my life and my entire reason for living. I am so in love with her and adore her entirely. I have never felt such a pure love as this. And with that...I am struggling.

In other aspects of my postpartum journey, I feel great. I stopped bleeding around 5 weeks, and my stitches have both healed and fallen out. I've had some sexy time with doctor clearance and contraception, and my belly has flattened a tad (and puffed up a bit again because YAY! No more HG! I can EAT!!). My psychiatrist raised my antidepressant dosage to combat PPD, and I'm still regularly attending therapy, and surprisingly I'm finally repairing relationships and breaking chains with my loved ones. I have returned to cooking and baking almost daily, and I have taken the roles of household chores almost entirely unto myself (because I want to be a homemaker). I even take the baby out with me to do the grocery shopping and run errands, and I get to drive my big sexy truck wherever I want, with an iced coffee in hand, and listening to my music and singing to my babygirl. And I take her all over the house with me, from room to room depending on what I'm doing, and she gets the boob whenever she wants it, and she comes with me in the shower and her daddy dries and dresses her afterwards so I can wash myself. We watch Baby Einstein sensory videos together, and I read to her from a book of fairy tales, before I hold her and pat her butt to put her to sleep every night....

Honestly, it's just a beautiful life to live. I almost feel normal. Better really, because I struggled so severely with depression and bipolar disorder before having her.

But... here's where I am struggling... I just started my first WFH job (to be home with her because we don't want to do daycare or babysitters) yesterday, and being in my office all day, only seeing her for a thirty minute lunch, and then having to hand her, crying and clinging to me, back to her daddy was so damn hard. And it did feel better when I clocked out and took her from my husband so he could go to work, but then it just felt like I lost the day with her. Because it was almost over. I felt like I lost so much of my precious time with her, and I was so jealous of my husband for having her all through the morning and early afternoon.

Which is hard to deal with because... I got what I wanted, ultimately, and I should be happy. I'm home with her! She's just on the other side of a door and a wall, so close I can hear her cry when her daddy changes her diaper because her little booty is cold. But it's not enough. I need to be actually holding her, snuggling her, giving her kisses and milk, being her safe place. I absolutely know she's safe, loved, and cared for when she's with her daddy, and I was angry at myself for being jealous of him, but I somehow felt like I was not doing my job as a mom well enough.

I tried really hard to push the negative thoughts about being jealous and angry away, because I personally don't like to dwell when a chain of thought is not productive. So I wrapped her in her blankie and sat on the couch with her, and once I had fed (and burped and changed) her, and she fell asleep, I put her down to do dishes and cook dinner, and again felt like I was losing time.

So I cooked dinner and ate, cared for her and cleaned up the kitchen, and when my husband came home, I fed him and we went to bed. I thought she'd sleep well because she has been lately, and has met all her growth milestones ahead of time so the pediatrician lets her go longer between nighttime feedings. But no, she cried SO HARD, and not even turning on her rocker and her rain sounds and giving her a bink would help. The moment I would move to put her down, she'd wail until I picked her back up. So I picked her up out of the bassinet and sat up in the bed with her. But then she'd get to the very edge of sleep and then fuss herself into wakefulness, and did it so much that it kept my husband awake. (I needed him to be up early to care for her while I worked, so I had to take her out of the room so he'd sleep. Found out later that he didn't sleep much because he was worried about ME not sleeping.)

She kept me up until 3 in the morning for the first time since she was about two weeks old. And something in me just knew that the day with all its changes had been rough on her too. I wasn't even mad. I just sat on the couch and fed, changed, and held her until she finally relaxed and fell asleep with her face in my throat, and then put her down and slept a couple hours before getting up for day two in my office.

Now I'm sitting on the couch, with her in my arms, snuggling her and crying because I just love her so frickin' much that it aches. Today was even harder than yesterday. I got through it, but I'm telling you, I felt physical relief walking out of my office and taking her in my arms, and she is obviously feeling much the same, because I set her down long enough to pee and she immediately began whimpering when I stood from the couch, and cried until I picked her back up after finishing.

My chest feels like it's full of rocks, but in the most wonderful way. Rocks of gold and rubies and diamonds fill my chest cavity. Because it's so painfully beautiful to love this little angel so much. And I have no other way to describe it. I hate that I have to be behind a closed door all day, watching her and her daddy snuggle from the baby monitor, and I worry that she'll think I've abandoned her. But I also can't stand the idea that if I don't put her down and I ignore the dishes and laundry and cooking that I'm being a bad wife for piling it all on my husband. (Who I know would do it for me in a heartbeat, but I don't want him to.)

So here I am, having everything I ever wanted with the man of my dreams, a perfect cherub of a daughter in my arms, my beautiful feline fur babies, a WFH job, and my big sexy pickup truck, living in my literal paradise... and still, I'm unhappy. I'm not depressed. I just don't feel happy. Because I can't snuggle my daughter 24/7?! What the fuck is wrong with me?? Do other moms feel like this??",1,1756508587.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

Kendu is a coin known for our relentless work ethic and in a space where community output is arguably the main stat that influences a coins value well... It is everything.

Kendu is below 20 million market cap right now with around 18,500 holders, yet we are consistently outperforming coins in the hundreds of millions or the billions. Kendu's engagement will only increase as our community gets bigger, basically it is pretty **inevitable** that one day Kendu will have the community manpower to trend on every piece of social media constantly. Kendu will be in everyones eyes and naturally we will attract many buyers.

In Kendu the Ken-Du mentality spreads amongst all of its holders

Below is an example of our insane work ethic.

Certik also agrees...Certik is a very reputable organisation and rates Kendu's community strength at 92/100, whilst other projects like SPX, MOG, Giga, Fartcoin,PNUT, Apu and Pepe... are all below 90. The only other community I have seen over 90 is Shib... 

There was recently a CoinMarketCap competition called  [\#BoostMeCMC](https://x.com/hashtag/BoostMeCMC?src=hashtag_click) and Kendu is literally one of the only projects to not rely on AI videos so far, Kendu has had 7 replies from CoinMarketCap already, it is literally insane the lengths this community will go to!

Here are some examples:

Kendu whilst dominating social media, is literally breaking into new levels of IRL initiatives, from energy drinks, to murals, to coffee Kendu has it all! These are all community led projects too!

I recently just finished PT and saw my cardiologist and both of them gave me the stern ""mom face"" and said I have GOT to exercise.   
To those people exercise is something you do after work and on the weekends bc you don't get movement at work...

But on a good day, I get rolling first thing-by 10am, (I have more energy in the morning) and by about 3pm I'm whupped and ready to sit down. For example today there was laundry, and packing up a bunch of stuff because I'm selling a piece of furniture, plus kitchen dither, etc. I'm up and moving and doing.   
I do stop for lunch and generally have coffee (decaf) about 3pm, but by the time I've been on my feet for like 4 hours, I'm done!   
  
I am supposed to stretch AND walk (or do some sort of cardio) every day, and I just can't make it happen!  I usually do stretches in the evening but yeah to me, housework IS the exercise, and I'm grateful when I get that much done!

So I (27F) have a good friend, we will call her M (also 27F). M and I have been friends since we were 16 but have gotten pretty close the past few years. Note that we went to the same college, are both neurodivergent, and are on the same dating apps (I'm on Hinge and Bumble, she's on both as well as Tinder).

I was hanging with M a few weeks ago. We met for coffee and were chatting about some of our mutual friends, and the topic of boys and the apps came up. I shared with M about a guy (25M) I have a crush on at my work (he's an aide at the school I sub in). I showed her a pic of him on his instagram and she said she didn't know him. Nothing unusual came from that exchange until I see a pic of the guy on my instagram news feed and saw she liked his post (?). I find it weird that she would be following him seemingly right after I show a picture. I know I probably shouldn't have done that but she's always been a loyal and generous friend to me. We actually had a former mutual friend who is actually my brother's ex gf who cheated on him, and M was horrified over it that she stopped being her friend as she feels strongly about cheating.

I will obviously not mention anything to M, but I just found it weird over the idea that she would a guy I am into after me saying I like him. I don't think any of M's friends know him. M is very socially awkward and I know she does follow guys as soon as she sees them on an app (she's told me this before). So maybe she saw his picture and forgot that I said anything to her. Just wanted to vent lol. Help a paranoid girl out! P.S. I know I don't ""own"" anyone and social media is a silly thing to obsess over. I don't check social media every day if I can help it. This guy doesn't even know I like him as far as I know! It's just weird the timing of it all lmao
