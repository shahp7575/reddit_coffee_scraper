Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1763655262.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

This one was specifically asked to be made with no water and extra base. Apparently, “extra” base just means they won’t dilute it further with water. Baristas told me policy changed and said that they have to mix half of the açaí juice box with half water at a baseline now. Very disappointing that Starbucks is expecting us to pay 6-7 dollars for a diluted drink!!! The Starbucks I got this at said there’s been many complaints about this new policy. I’d love to put in a formal complaint, as this has been my go to drink for 10 years (and I don’t like coffee, so I thought of this as my zoom zoom juice). Who is the best person/department to reach out to at the Starbucks company?

Why did you let/ask her to do that? Like, 64% of you players did it. I, for one, had Robert do it instead because he doesn't mind and it would make things more even, considering I had dispatched Visi on much more mundane calls previously, such as the coffee run.

I keep thinking this is a prank.  My jerk of a boyfriend laughed when I told him about the invitation. 

“Cami, be fucking for real, why would they invite someone with less than ten thousand followers?” He barked out a laugh, and I flipped him off.

“Why are you so mean? “I snap.  “I don’t know why I was invited, but this could be a fantastic opportunity for my travel vlog and my content. Anyway, if this is real, do you want to come with me? Steve, we need to figure out what’s going on with our relationship. Being away from here could help and change our perspective.” I say, and he shrugs.  


My phone chimes with a message from TikTok. It’s from an account called El Conjeo, no one knows his real name. He is a friend and we have chatted about our content through messages. He is an advocate for the Latino community, but he does it humorously. He also wears a black rabbit mask; no one has seen his face.  Unlike me, he has over one hundred thousand followers.

El Conjeo: Yo, chica, did you get an invitation to Tati’s thing?

Cami_mami: Yes, is it real?

El Conjeo: Yes, it’s real. I just got an email with all the information and rules. All that shit. Check to see if you got the email.


I look at my email and boom, there it is:

Dear Cami,

We are beyond thrilled to invite you to stay at Tati’s home for the week to learn, collab, and network with other influencers. This year, we have handpicked all our guests based on the content you make, not their followers.  We are all here for the same reason: to bring our Latino culture to the forefront and show what we can do! We will pay for you and a guest to fly to Los Angeles. We will have drivers pick you up at the airport, but the location will remain a secret. The rules are listed below.
We look forward to spending time with you!

1.	PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM THE WEEK UNTIL YOU LEAVE.
2.	WE ARE HERE TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES AS SUCH: NO MASKS ALLOWED
3.	YOU ARE FREE TO ROAM THE HOUSE, USE THE AMENITIES, BUT PLEASE STAY OFF THE THIRD FLOOR.

Thank you,

Greg, 
Manager of Tati Moreno

“OMG! It’s real, Steve!” I screech. He rolls his eyes at my excitement. 

“When is it?” He asks.

“In two weeks, do you think you can come?”

“I guess,” he says.

“Don’t sound too excited,”  I say, leaving the room.  I don’t know why I try with him, but we have been together since we were sixteen, and we are twenty-one. He has changed a lot, and I don’t like who he has become. He’s mean. I know what I need to do, but I’m scared. 


Two weeks later, we are on an airplane from Texas to Los Angeles. I love to travel and make content about my travels.  I sit on the plane with Steve, and he is fidgeting all over the place, and it’s starting to annoy me.

“Are you okay?” I ask.

“No, actually. I uhhhh,” he starts and stops.

“Can you just tell me?

“Okay, I made a mistake, a big one.” He says, looking at me and then at the floor.

“What did you do?”  I say in a shaky voice

“I cheated.” He says

“You what?  You cheated?” I ask. Somehow deep in my heart, I knew he was doing something. “With who?”

“Lucy,” he says in a whisper.

“Lucy, your boss, Lucy! The one who comes to our apartment for game nights, Lucy?” I whisper-shout. The lady next to Steve looks at us and quickly turns away. He nods. He fidgets some more, “Is that all?”  I ask, and he shakes his head. “Spit it out, Steve?”

“She’s pregnant.” He says. I know this is over, and it’s been over for a long time, but this hurts. A lone tear falls down my cheek. He goes to grab my hand, and I pull away. “Cami, babe.”

“Don’t babe me, Steve, you checked out of this relationship a year ago. Be honest. I was the only one fighting for us.”

On our flight, we sat side by side in silence. I cried silently for something that I have already been mourning, but it is now real, and it cuts deep.  If I am being real, I have had a crush on someone I have never met, but I would’ve never thought to cheat on Steve.  We grab our bags and find a man holding a sign that says ‘Welcome Cami Cortez and Steve Castro.’

“Hi, that’s us,” Steve says, trying to grab my hand. This time, I let him.  He leads us to a black limo SUV with all the windows blacked out. We get in, and Steve tries to sit next to me, and I move. “We need to talk about this, Cami.”

“The time for talking was when you felt like being with another bitch,” I snip.

“Is there any fixing this?”

“No, we haven’t been in a real relationship for over a year, Steve. We have not been intimate in over six months.  It’s like we are roommates, nothing else.  You don’t love me, Steve.”

“Do you love me?” he asks

“How long have you been cheating?”

“Answer my question,” he demands.

“Answer me,” I yell.

“Over a year.” He snaps. 

“ A year! I have been fighting for us! I loved you with everything I had.”

“You loved me? As in past tense?”

“Yes, I am realizing that now. I had false hope, and you made everything clear. So no, I’m not in love with you. Yes, I have love for you, but I will never love you again. There is no fixing this.”

We finally get to our destination, and since the windows were all black, we could not see out of them. We have no idea where we are, but we see the massive house, and it’s stunning. We are greeted by a man dressed in slacks and a white button-up shirt. He is handsome with his salt-and-pepper hair. He has his hand outstretched, and I take it to shake.

“Greg,” he says, shaking my hand, and then he shakes Steve’s hand.

“I’m Cami, and this is Steve,” I say.

“Tati sends her apologies, she will not be here until tomorrow night, her flight got cancelled coming from Barbados.”
“Oh, no worries, I say.

“We have lunch ready, and we have some of the others here already.” He leads us into the vast house, and my goodness, it’s gorgeous, all white and black tiles: high vaulted ceilings and pillars. He leads us to a large room with tables set up with food and drinks. “Help yourself to food, and your bags will be taken to your room. If you need anything, please let me know.”

We get plates and fill our plates with a little bit of everything they have to offer. We find a table, and Steve looks at me expectantly. 

“You don’t want to work this out?”

“No, that is something you can’t fix,” I say, trying not to cry, but I lose the battle and cry. 

“Wow, I make one mistake and that’s it?” 

“It was a huge mistake. I’m done.” I wipe my eyes. 

“You’re a fucking bitch,” he spits. Greg comes up and looks between the two of us.

“Everything okay?” he asks.

“I think I need to leave,” Steve says.

“Yeah, I think you should,” Greg says. I will arrange a ride back to the airport, but you will need to pay the fee to change the flight.”

“Fuck this shit, “ Steve yells. 

“Okay, let’s go,” Greg says, leading him out of the room. I look down, and I feel the tears start to fall. Not because I’m sad about Steve cheating, but because he humiliated me in front of a room full of strangers. I look up and see a guy looking at me  and he starts to walk over. He looks like a young Pedro Pascal.

“Cami, are you okay?” he hands me a tissue. I look at him again it and dawns on me who he is.

“El Conjeo?” I ask. He nods and grabs my arm to help me stand up. He envelopes me in a hug so tight I squeak out and laugh. 

“Call me Pablo,” he says.  “Whatever is going on, I’m here if you want to talk. Let’s finish eating because they are going to give us a tour of the house. Can I sit with you?” My heart is pounding because my crush is actually hugging me, and he’s gorgeous. 

I fill him in on what happened, and he is very sweet, listening to it all. Talking about it makes me see that this relationship ended ages ago.  He told me that he is glad that I’m seeing what pendejo Steve was. He told me I deserve better than that because I was worthy and beautiful.  There were many other people in the room, and we were lost in our own conversation. The room was full of loud laughter and chattering. An older woman walked in; she was wearing a black ankle-length dress, modest but very modern. She emoted sheer elegance. She cleared her throat, and the room went silent.

“We will be starting the tour now. Each of you has a color on your pamphlet, given to you when you arrived, which will be your group for the week. I turned my pamphlet over and saw a red dot on the back, and I looked over at Pablo, and he showed me a red dot as well.  He gives me a thumbs up and smiles. We go and find our fellow red dots. “Red dots will be with me.”

I look around our group and see all the other creators that I recognize, and I get so excited to be here.  The old woman takes us from room to room, telling us the history of each room. She hasn’t told us her name, which is a bit odd to me.  Her eyes look familiar to me. Pablo and I think that she is Tati’s mother or grandmother, as they have similar eyes.  She leads us to a room with Tati's family history, including many photos of the family and a family crest featuring a black Aztec bird. It is the same tattoo I have on my clavicle. I see out of the corner of my eye Pablo pulling up his sleeve, and on his wrist, he also has the same tattoo. Our eyes meet, and I pull down my top slightly and show him mine. I see the old lady looking between us, and it creeps me out. A man comes in with a tray of tiny glass cylinders filled with a blue liquid. 

“Let’s say a cheers to everyone who has come to join us this week,” the old woman says. Everyone takes a cylinder and coughs after drinking it, except Pablo and me —we drink it without a reaction.  Greg and the old woman share a look, unnoticed by everyone but us. I look at Pablo, and he stares right at me, and he shrugs. “You are dismissed to your rooms to freshen up if you would like.”

We go up the marble staircase, and it screams rich. I would never be able to have this, but would I want it?   Maybe not.  Turns out Pablo and have rooms right next to each other. Each room has its own bathroom. Pablo comes into my room, looking confused.

“Hey, does your bathroom have a mirror? He asks. I look in my bathroom, and there isn’t one. I come out and shake my head. “How the fuck am I gonna be able to shave my face without cutting myself. I look around the room, and there isn’t a mirror in there either. 

“There are no mirrors in the room either.” I go back into the bathroom, and this time Pablo follows me. “There are lines on the wall showing where it was.  This is weird.”

“The old woman is creepy, right? He asks.

“She kept,” I start.

“Staring at us.” He finishes.  I nod. We go out into the hall, and Janet, one of the other content creators, comes out of her room looking confused, too. “No mirrors?

“Yes, but there are also these triangle things on the windows, so when the window curtain is open, it shines on the wall and floor.”

“What?” We say. We go into her room and see the triangles on the floor and wall. I run into my room and see a star, and Pablo runs back to his room.

“I have a pentagram thing. I am freaked the fuck out.”

“Me too.” I am petrified. Greg walks up and startles us.

“We would like you to be downstairs in about an hour for drinks and games.”

“Greg, why are there no mirrors in the rooms?” Janet asks. 

“The previous owners didn’t believe in them because they hated vanity.”

“I thought Tati’s family owned the house?” Pablo asks. I notice that Greg looks irritated.

“Yes, her great-grandparents didn’t like the mirrors.” He says. With that, he walks away.  All the symbolism on the windows still shakes me up.

“You good? Pablo asks.

“I’m kind of spooked,” I say, looking up at him. He hugs me tightly.
“I’ll take care of you, Cami. I promise.” Pablo says.  He looks at his phone, and he looks at me. “My phone’s screen is black and it won’t do anything.” I take my phone out of my pocket, and it's blacked out too. “What fuck is going on? Let’s go outside and see if it changes?”

“Okay,” I say. He takes me by the hand and leads me downstairs and out of the back door that leads to a private beach. “This place seems so strange.” We look at our phone and still nothing. “I want to leave, Pablo.”

“Something fucked up is going on, but I can’t figure it out.” We see a worker on a smoke break. “Hey, excuse me.”

“Yes, Pablo, how can you be of assistance?” the worker asked. Pablo’s eyebrows shoot up.

“How do you know my name?” Pablo asks.

“Madam has us memorize your faces from photos and your name before your visit.”

“Madam?” I ask.

“Yes, madam is what we call her.” 

“Can we use a phone? Our phones don’t seem to be working. “ I ask.

“Sorry, but staff are not allowed to have phones in the house while we are working.”

“But why are our phones not working? I ask, getting nervous.

“It’s a dead zone for cellphones.” 

“What city are we in? “Pablo asks. The worker scurries off as if something scared him. I turn around and see the old woman, Madam, coming up.

“Will you be joining us for drinks and games?”  Madam asks.

“Yes, we will be right there.” Pablo asks. He squeezes my hand. “Ma’am, I have a deadline for an article I was working on. Is there a way for me to get to a coffee shop to get WIFI to send it over so we both can go?”

“Yes, I think I can arrange that.” She says . I feel a sense of relief. “Well we will see if we have drivers available.

“I can Uber there if I need to.”

“Ubers don’t come up here, but we can see what I can do.”


We go to the game night, and I still can’t shake this weird feeling, and I don’t have the money to pay for a return flight. The games are fun, but Pablo and I are separated during the game time, and we keep looking at each other.  I look around, and I don’t see Janet. 

“Where is Janet?” I ask quietly to her sister Milly.

“She said she had a headache and wanted to sleep, and she would come down for dinner,” Milly says. She is drinking her third whiskey sour. “Maybe I should slow down. Janet hates it when I drink.” A bell is rung, signaling that dinner is being served. I go over quickly to Pablo. We find a table and our food is placed in front of us. It’s a fantastic steak, potatoes and asparagus. It’s divine.  I moan my appreciation of how good it is. Pablo coughs and laughs.

“Stop making noises like that, it’s giving me ideas.” He chortles. 

“Stop, you don’t even like that,” I laugh.

“Who says I don’t?” he smiles, and my heart skips a beat. “I like you, Cami, like really like you.”

“I have a secret, I do too,” I say on a giggle. I look up and see Milly running in the dining room.

“Has anyone seen Janet?” she says.

“She’s not sleeping? I ask.

“No, her bed was made, and her bags are gone.” She says. I can hear the fear in her voice. 

“What do you mean her bags are gone?”  Pablo says.

“All her stuff is gone,” she is now hysterical. I get up and hug her to me.  Greg comes up to us.

“Greg, have you seen Janet?” Pablo asks.

“Janet, asked to leave. She told us to tell her sister to stay and have a great time.”

“My sister wouldn’t do that! She wouldn’t leave me.” Milly cries. 

“Well, she did, “ Madam says. She looks different. I can’t pinpoint what it is, but she looks different. 

“Sit with us, Milly, have dinner with us,” Pablo says, guiding us back to our table. As soon as Greg and Madam leave the room, Pablo lowers his head. “ I’m going to figure out what the fuck is going on tomorrow.”  There is a bonfire at the beach, and we are expected to attend it, and we all sit huddled together. I am scared.  We sit there for an hour and decide it’s time for bed.  We walk Milly to her room, and she goes in. We tell her that if she gets scared, she should come to my room.

“Do you want me to stay with you?” Pablo asks. I nod furiously. He goes into his room to get his toothbrush and to change. “We are leaving tomorrow.” He says as he lies next to me, staring at the ceiling.  We both stare at the ceiling and fall asleep a fit full night’s sleep, but we fall asleep.

We get up, get dressed, and go to find Milly. Her room is open, and she is not in there. Her bed is made, and her things are gone. We turn and see Greg. This man appears out of nowhere and scares me. 

“She just left to be with her sister,” he says. “Her flight was a redeye. Pablo, I know you ride a motorcycle. We have one if you want to go to town. Unfortunately, it’s a one-seater, so Cami, you would have to stay here. “ 

“Let me just grab my jacket and backpack, and I will be ready to leave,”  Pablo says. Pablo grabs my hand and pulls me into his room. “Stay with everyone. Don’t go anywhere by yourself. I will be back as soon as I can.”  Pablo pushes my loose hair behind my ear, and he kisses me gently. “I promise I will be back for you.”

I go outside with him. They bring him a motorcycle, and he gets on it. I go over to him, and he hugs me and kisses me again. My heart is beating so fast, I have never been scared like this. My comfort is leaving, and I don’t know what to do. I eat with all of the other content creators, and they are oblivious to my fear; all they chatter about is that Tati is coming tonight.  

“I wonder what’s on the third floor?” A makeup influencer, Mario asks.

“I don’t know, but Greg kept telling us not to go up there. I heard someone ask why, and he didn’t answer her, “ another influencer says as she continues eating. How can they eat at a time like this?  

“Good morning, everyone. I’m Louisa, and I will be leading a hike today. We will meet out back in ten minutes.”

“Do we all have to go?” Mario asks.

“No, it’s optional,” she says.  I excuse myself to use the restroom. As I am in the restroom, I decide to be brave and go up and see what is on that third floor. I leave my bedroom and peek around, and see that the hallway is empty. I look out the window, and everyone seems to be out back getting ready to go on the hike. 


I see the steps leading up at the back of the hallway, and I run as fast as I can up the stairs. There is a velvet rope with a sign that says ""Do not enter."" I crawl under the velvet rope and see only one door. The doorknob has all the symbols that the windows had on it. I try my luck, and it clicks open. I gasp at what I see, but I don’t have time to react. I hear Madam and Greg’s voices coming, so I throw myself into an old wardrobe like the one in Narnia.  My heart is beating out of my chest.  What happens next freaks me the fuck out.


                                                                         Pablo

When Greg  brings me the motorcycle, he shows me a map and tells me to stay on this path and only this one. I nod and take off, and the bike fucking sucks, it’s sputtering the whole way.  It takes me twenty minutes to finally see civilization. I see a run-down coffeehouse, and I go in. I see the cashier, and I go up and smile at her.

“Hi, I’m lost. Can you tell me what city this is?” I ask, and she looks at me with a head tilt.  

“Pablo, right? “ she asks. 

“How did you know that?” I ask.

“Madam said you were coming.” She says, and my blood goes cold when I see the worker who was on the beach with us. 

“Hi, Pablo,” he says with a lopsided smile. 

“What the fuck is this? I ask, and I completely freak out.  The female cashier is throwing out trash in the back.  

“Are you going to work on your article like you said you were?”  the guy says. I take out my phone, and it still has a black screen. I show him my phone.  I take out my laptop from my backpack, and it won’t turn on either. “What a pity you probably have to head back. Stay on the path, don’t stray.”

“What if I stray?”

“I dunno, don’t want to find out,” he laughs.  I go to the door and leave. I need to get to Cami and fast.  I grab the helmet, and a tiny sheet of paper falls out of it.

‘RUN!!!! Hole back fence, no motorcycle. GO NOW!’

I dip down below the window and make a run for the back, and my lungs are burning. I see the hole and go through it, scratching my back. I keep running until I find two guys working on a car, and I am so out of breath. I’m in panic mode and must look crazy to these guys. They go on alert as I run up to them. I trip and fall to my knees, trying to catch my breath. 

“You good, bro?” One of the guys says. I try to stand, and he helps me. I shake my head.

“My friend is stuck in that mansion over on the hill over there. There is weird shit going on over there,” I point over my shoulder without looking.

“Are you on something, Carnal? What mansion?” The other guy says. I turn around and look behind me, and I freak the fuck out. I can’t believe what I am seeing. The mansion was just there, I can see in the distance, but it’s not a mansion —it's a dilapidated house sitting on a tiny hill. “Seriously, bro, what did you take?” 

“I never heard anyone refer to that Cucuy house as a mansion before,” the other guy laughs.

“Cucuy house?” I say.

“Yeah, when we were kids, our dad would tell us that used to be an insane lady's house. They said she was obsessed with Aztec birds, and she would kidnap people who had a tattoo of the bird, take their beauty and youth.”

“Dude, stop telling him that he is obviously on a bad high; you're going to tweak him out even more than he is.” 

“I got to go and get Cami,” I ran back the direction I came from to the fence, only there is no fence, there is a high cement traffic barricade. There is no way for me to climb or scale it. My phone starts beeping, so I take it off. I look at my phone, and it’s my mom. I call her.

“Mama,” I say in a shaky voice.

“PABLO, is it you? You’re alive!” she cries.

“Yes, it’s me. What are you talking about?”

“A man called me yesterday and told me and your Papa that you died in an airplane crash on the way to your influencer event.”

“NO! That’s not true. I’m alive.”

“Where are you?”  I can hear my dad ask.

“I have no clue, hold on, let me find out.” I run back to the guys I was talking to. “This is going to sound weird, but what city are we in?”

“Yeah, that does sound weird, but we are in Boise.”

“Idaho, I thought I was in LA,” I say. 

“Mijo, get to an airport and get on a plane and come home to Texas.” My dad says.

“I need to get Cami,” I say, freaking out. 
“We will call the police and tell them so they can go get her.”

“No, at the airport they’ll look for me there.”

“ Okay, will rent you a car and have them bring it to you. “

“What about Cami? I feel bad leaving her.”

“I told you we will do everything we can to help her. Papa ordered the car. “ I hand the phone over to one of the guys, and they give the address to where to send it.”

Once the car comes, I try every route to get to Cami, but every turn is a dead end. I finally give up and drive out of the city. 


                                                            Cami

I peek through the wardrobe's slats and see Madam and Greg standing in the middle of the room. I also see Steve, Janet, and Milly hanging upside down on rafters from the ceiling with their throats cut, and their blood is draining from them into giant bowls. They stand in front of shattered mirrors —the mirrors meant for the bedrooms. They both pick up the bowls with blood in them and bring them to their lips and take long drinks. I can see Madam’s reflection in the mirror, and she is smiling at herself when she turns around, taking my breath away. Her mirrored reflection shows Madam, but when she is standing right in front of me, it is Tati.  Greg has morphed into Mika, Tati’s fiancé. My heart is pounding in my ears.  She looks back in the mirror and smiles at herself again.

“Everyone wants to be famous for doing nothing these days. People are so desperate to be the next big thing. To be popular, to go —what's the word again… oh yeah, viral. To be the best and most beautiful.  People would sell their souls to be all of those things……..right, Cami?”

1p273qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vonnegut/comments/1p273qb/vonnegut_as_inspiration_for_my_own_bizarre/,Vonnegut as inspiration for my own bizarre projects,"Kurt Vonnegut is probably the first writer who made me realize you can say the darkest, truest thing imaginable and still make people laugh while you do it. There’s this dry, sad, hopeful, cynical, human voice in his books that feels like someone shrugging their shoulders at the universe while handing you a cup of coffee and saying, “Yeah, it’s all insane, but let’s get through it anyway.” Lets laugh while we are at it too.

Vonnegut made me feel like it was okay to not have answers. Okay to write about chaos. Okay to treat absurdity as a legitimate response to existence. He wrote like a man who had seen everything and still believed people were worth caring about. That combination of hilarity and heartbreak changed me.

I ended up writing a book from that same spiritual neighborhood. Not a copy, just something shaped by the same permission slip he gave everyone who reads him. Mine is a bit more profane and immature. Pancakes and Poor Life Choices is full of cosmic nonsense, emotional truth bombs, multiverse disasters, and characters trying desperately to survive the ridiculousness of being alive. It’s my attempt at carrying a little piece of that Vonnegut honesty forward.

Thought some fellow fans might appreciate the lineage.

The headache started on night two. Now, it is something else. A thick, solid pressure behind my eyes, pulsing in time with my heartbeat. It feels less like a headache and more like my skull is trying to unmake itself from the inside.

I was at my desk, staring at an incident report until the letters bled together, when Nika’s Father shouldered his way into the station. His daughter, Nika, was a silent shadow behind him, her small face far too serious.

""Harper!"" Heaving the cooler onto the break room table with a wet thud. ""Forty pounds of silver salmon. For saving my girl.""

I stood, the motion sending a fresh, hot spike through my temples. ""That is too much. I was just doing my job.""

My objection died as Nika’s voice, small but impossibly clear, cut through the station’s low hum.

""Auntie showed me where to wait,"" she said. ""She said someone would come before the bad thing did.""

Then the studio went silent. One moment, there was the familiar clutter of noise. Chief Morrison’s low chuckle, the clack of Dale’s keyboard, the static hiss of the radio. The next, there was nothing. It was as if a glass bell had dropped over the entire room. Morrison was frozen, his coffee cup an inch from his lips. Dale’s hand hovered over his mouse, his fingers poised but unmoving. The radio’s static did not just go quiet. The absence of it was a physical weight in the air.

My gaze dropped to Nika. Her dark eyes were fixed on me, and they held a knowledge that had no business in the face of an eight year old. They were ancient, and terrified.

___


A full three seconds passed. The pressure in my head tightened.

Then, the world rushed back in, too loud and too fast.

Morrison let out a sharp, forced laugh. ""Nika, honey, you know Auntie. She is everyone's friend. She was probably just praying for you, is all."" He took a sip of his coffee.

""Right,"" Dale chimed in, his voice a notch too high. He clicked his mouse with unnecessary force. ""Kid, Auntie's got a sixth sense about these things. Like a guardian angel.""

He laid a heavy hand on his daughter's head, his smile tight. ""Do not go giving the Officer  your wild stories, iñuk.""

But Nika did not look away from me. She did not even blink. ""Have you seen her since that night?"" she asked.

The silence returned, but this time it felt deliberate. A solid wall. ""Hey,"" I said, my voice sounding too loud. No one turned. I forced a chuckle. ""Morrison? Dale?"" I waved a hand in front of the Chief's face. His eyes didn't flicker. He took another sip of coffee, staring right through me. My chuckle died in my throat. The truth, cold and absolute, settled in my gut. Nika was the only one who could see me.

The throbbing in my skull intensified, a sudden, vicious twist. ""I see her all the time,"" I managed, my voice rough. ""She helps with dispatch once in a while, Nika.""

""No."" Her voice was flat, certain. A verdict. ""Have you really looked at her? I mean, truly looked? Once you do, you will know what I mean.""

He was already pulling her toward the door, his apologies trailing behind him. ""Kids and their imaginations, you know how it is. Thanks again for everything, Harper.""

The door clicked shut.

Instantly, the station snapped back to life. The clatter of keyboards, the murmur of conversation, the rustle of paperwork. It was all there, but it was wrong. It was like watching a film where the audio is out of sync. A hollow performance, and I was the only one who had missed their cue.

I stood, rooted to the spot, staring at the dark plastic cooler beaded with cold water.

And a cold, solid thought formed in my mind, cutting through the pain.

What does Auntie look like?

I see her every day. I take my coffee when she tells me to. I nod at her updates over the radio. But I cannot, for the life of me, summon a single specific detail of her face. Not the curve of her smile, not the shape of her hands, not the way she moves through a room.

It is all just a pleasant blur.

I spend my lunch break in the basement archives. Down here, the world is reduced to the grit of dust on my fingertips and the dry whisper of turning pages. When my phone lights up with my wife's call, I watch the screen go dark. Everything else can wait. Everything else is noise.

The station's records go back to 1962, when the formal SAR program was established. Before that it's just scattered reports in the municipal building's library annex.

I start with recent files. Pull Auntie's employment records from 2020.

There she is. Photo ID clipped to a W-2. Same Auntie. Grey hair pulled back. Reading glasses on a beaded chain. Warm smile.

Date of birth: March 15, 1960.

1. Another form. Employee health insurance enrollment. Same photo, maybe a few less wrinkles.

Date of birth: March 15, 1960.

1. Pension paperwork.

Date of birth: March 15, 1960.

1. Original hiring documentation. The photo is slightly faded, but it's *her*. Same face. Same smile.

Date of birth: March 15, 1960.

I flip back and forth between the photos. The lighting is different. The backgrounds change. But her face stays exactly the same age in every single image across thirty years.

The headache is a ice pick now, driving into my frontal lobe with every heartbeat.

I drive to the library and request historical records, search and rescue reports, anything from the region. The librarian, an elder named Margaret, peers at me over her glasses. ""That's quite a project. What are you hoping to find?""

""I just need to understand the history,"" I say, my voice tight. My phone buzzes in my pocket. Again. I know it's her. I know I'm stressing her out, but the thought is a distant thing, drowned out by the static in my head. I have days, maybe less. This takes precedence. Everything takes precedence.

She brings me photo albums. Community newsletters. Newspaper clippings.

1956 - A group photo volunteers after a successful rescue. In the back row, partially obscured: Auntie. Same grey hair. Same glasses.

1968 - A dedication ceremony for the new station. In the crowd: Auntie.

1987 - A wartime civil defense meeting. The photo is grainy, black and white, but I can make out her silhouette in the second row.

Margaret leans in to look, her pleasant librarian’s smile still in place. It doesn't waver as her eyes track Auntie’s face across the decades. She doesn't startle or question. She simply nods, as if confirming a known fact.

""That's Auntie in all of them, isn't it?"" she murmurs. ""Funny how some folks just have that… timeless quality.""

My mouth is dry. ""How old is she?""

""Oh, you know elders."" Margaret pats my shoulder, her touch making me flinch. ""It's rude to ask.""

""Why do you want to know?"" she adds.

Because it doesn't make sense. The words scream inside my skull. Because I want to hold these photos side-by-side and force you to see that the same woman is in a photo from 1952 and a report from last year. Because everyone is blind when they look at her.

Instead I say, ""Just curious.""

Margaret's smile doesn't reach her eyes. ""Curiosity is good, Ben. But some things out here, they don't want to be understood. They just want to *be*.""

She walks away before I can ask what that means.

I make it home at 6 PM with the headache drilling so deep I'm seeing halos around every light source.

Sarah's waiting in the kitchen. Arms crossed. Jaw set in that way means we're about to have the same fight we've been having for three months.

""You missed dinner again.""

""I was working.""

""You're always working."" She's crying now, angry tears. ""When you're here you're not *here*, Ben. You're somewhere else. With her.""

""With who?""

""Denise. The secretary. Don't play stupid, everyone at the station talks.""

""Sarah, I'm not—""

""Then where were you today? Dale saw you in the archives for two hours. Said you looked like you were researching something intense. What were you researching, Ben?""

I don't have a good answer. Can't explain that I was looking up photos of a seventy-something dispatch operator who apparently hasn't aged since World War II. Can't explain that a eight-year-old girl warned me about a woman, whose hypnotized the goddamn town. Can't explain any of it without sounding insane.

So I say nothing.

Sarah's face crumples. ""Get out.""

""Sarah—""

""Get. Out. Go stay with whoever you've been running to. I don't care anymore.""

She's shoving my jacket at me, pushing me toward the door. I grab my keys off the hook and stumble into the cold without a plan.

I sit in my truck in the driveway, engine running, heat blasting. The station has a bunk room, but Dale is probably there. I have no friends in this town, not really. Just coworkers and acquaintances. I could drive to Fairbanks. Get a hotel. Clear my head.

Instead, I put the truck in reverse.

And that is when I see it.

A warm, golden light spills from the kitchen window. The silhouette of my wife moves past the sink. Then, the sound hits me. It is not the quiet I left, but the vibrant noise of a family meal. The clatter of plates, my son’s high-pitched story, my daughter’s giggling interruption. And underneath it all, a man’s easy, resonant laugh.

My laugh.

I kill the engine and step out into the freezing air, drawn to the window like a ghost. I peer inside.

There they are. Sarah, the kids, and me. They are gathered around the table. The man at the head of the table leans back in his chair, a wide, relaxed smile on his face. It is an expression I have not worn in years. He says something, and Sarah laughs, her real, unforced laugh, and reaches out to squeeze his arm.

I am running before I know I have moved. Up the porch steps. Through the door, which is unlocked. The sounds and smells of dinner, pot roast, my favorite, wash over me. I stand frozen in the hallway entrance, watching this perfect imitation of my life.

""Get out,"" I whisper. The words have no force.

The man, the other me, turns his head. His eyes meet mine across the room. And he smiles, a slow, knowing smile.

The room shifts.

Suddenly, I am the one sitting at the head of the table. The taste of pot roast is in my mouth. My daughter tugs on my sleeve, and Sarah smiles at me from across the table. I try to stand, to scream, but my body is a puppet. I feel my face form a warm, paternal smile. I hear my own voice, but it is not mine, say, ""This is perfect.""

My eyes dart to the dark glass of the patio door. In the reflection, I see it.

Standing in the corner of the kitchen, watching.

The Walker. It wears my SAR coat, its face a smudged photograph. It tilts its head, and my reflection in the glass mimics the gesture.

Sarah’s smile becomes fixed, her gaze intensifying. ""We are so glad you are finally here, Ben,"" she says, her voice syrupy and wrong. ""Stay with us.""

I throw myself backward, the chair clattering to the floor. I scramble on hands and knees toward the front door as their voices rise in a harmonious, desperate chorus. ""Ben, do not go. Ben, we love you. Ben, your dinner is getting cold.""

I stumble into the truck, slam the locks, and force myself to look back. They are all at the kitchen window now, Sarah and the kids. They stand in a row, staring out at me with identical, placid, vacant smiles.

The drive to Auntie's cabin is a blur, my body operating on an autopilot my mind can no longer sustain. By the time I park, the clock reads 9 PM. The headache is no longer just pain. It has begun to feel like static.

A soft glow came from inside her cabin. I staggered to the door, my legs unsteady.

It swung inward before my fist could connect.

And there, standing in the threshold, I finally saw her.

The flush in her cheeks is wrong. Too red. Like old meat. Her body is too thin beneath her house dress, bones pressing against skin that's lost its elasticity. When she smiles, her lips pull back too far, showing too many teeth.

""Benjamin."" Her voice is the same warm rasp. ""Are you alright?""

I try to run. Try to get back to the truck.

But she's there. Hand on my shoulder. Impossibly fast.

""Shh, child. Come inside. You're seeing things, aren't you? The Walkers do that. They get in your head. Make you doubt what's real."" She guides me toward the door with surprising strength. ""But I can help. Come have tea. We'll talk.""

I don't want to go inside.

But the headache is so bad I can barely stand, and her cabin is warm, and she's the only person who's acknowledged that any of this is happening. I followed her inside, the door closing behind me with a soft, final click. The cabin felt smaller than I remembered, and darker, as if the walls had crept inward to swallow the light. I noticed the shadows in the corners didn't behave properly, stretching and pooling in defiance of the single oil lamp that burned on the counter. 

Without a word, Auntie guided me to her kitchen table, her hand on my arm as she directed me into a chair. She moved to the stove to put a kettle on, her motions possessing a fluid, unnerving grace that belonged to someone decades younger.

""You're on night three,"" she says, not a question. ""The middle point. That's when it gets worst. Your mind is trying to bridge two states of being. Warm and cold. Living and..."" She trails off. Pours tea into mismatched mugs.

I wrap my hands around the mug. The ceramic is cold despite the steaming liquid inside.

""Why is this happening to me?"" My voice sounds distant.

""Because you looked."" She sits across from me. ""And because you saved the girl.""

""Nika.""

""Yes."" Something flickers across Auntie's face. Almost regret. Almost. ""She wasn't supposed to come back, Benjamin. Some accounts are meant to close.""

""What does that mean?""

She sips her tea. ""Would you like to hear a story? An old one. About the ocean and sacrifice and the price of living too long.""

I nod because I don't know what else to do. Because the cabin feels like it's pressing down on me. Because I can feel something in the corners, waiting.

Auntie's voice drops to a storyteller's cadence.

""There was once a woman who refused to marry. Her father tried everything—arranged matches with strong hunters, wealthy traders, even shamans. But she refused them all. She had no interest in men.""

The tea tastes like seawater.

""One winter, she fell in love with her dog. A beautiful animal, strong and loyal. They say she loved it more than anything human. When her father discovered this, he was filled with shame. He took her out in his kayak, far from shore, and threw her into the ice-water to drown.""

I want to put down the mug but my hands won't move.

""She tried to climb back into the kayak. Grabbed the gunwale. Begged her father to pull her up. But he took his *ulu* and cut off her fingers. One by one. Each finger that fell into the water became something new. Seals. Whales. All the creatures of the deep. And the woman herself sank down to become Sedna, the mother of the sea, the keeper of drowned things.""

Auntie's voice has changed. Become layered. Like multiple people speaking in unison.

""But here's the part they don't tell children. Sedna didn't just become a goddess. She became hungry. Every finger she lost was a piece of warmth taken from the living world. And to keep existing, to keep her place in the deep, she needs to replace that warmth. Again and again. Forever.""

My vision is tunneling. The cabin walls seem to breathe.

""We all make choices, Benjamin. Some of us choose to drown. Some of us choose to cut the fingers. Some of us—"" she leans forward, and her face is changing, cheeks hollowing further, skin pulling tight against skull, ""—some of us choose to *feed*.""

In the window behind her, I see them. Walkers. Three of them. Standing perfectly still. Watching.

I try to stand but my legs are numb. Try to speak but my tongue is thick.

Auntie reaches across the table. Touches my hand, with her cold hands.

""I'm sorry, Benjamin. But you understand, don't you? A child's life buys more than an adult's. More years. More warmth. But you saved her. You broke the equation. So now I need yours.""

She is holding a curved knife with a bone handle.

I try to move, but my body is leaden, and a cold understanding dawns: I know what she has put in my drink.

""It won't hurt. The cold comes fast at this stage. You'll just... stop. And I'll have seventeen more winters. Maybe less. I'm not as young as I used to be."" She laughs, and it sounds like wind through empty buildings. ""Though I suppose seven centuries is a good run.""

The Walkers in the window are inside now. Standing behind my chair. I can feel them. Radiating cold.

Auntie raises the knife, and in that suspended moment, a fractured memory crashes over me. It comes in a flash: a woman is screaming, running desperately through deep snow with a mob at her heels, their torches cutting through the darkness as voices shout ""witch,"" ""demon,"" ""unclean."" She stumbles and falls, and someone catches her, holding her down while another brings the ulu to her face. 

The blade cuts from cheek to jaw, and she is screaming a name, over and over, in a desperate, pleading mantra. Akna, Akna, Akna. I shout the name without thinking, a raw cry that tears from my throat: ""AKNA!""

___


The effect is instantaneous. Auntie recoils as if I've struck her, and the knife clatters to the floor.

Light pours through the window. not moonlight, not aurora, something older. It illuminates Auntie in harsh relief, and I see what she truly is. The centuries of borrowed time written in the spaces between her cells. The hollow where her humanity used to be. The scar on her cheek that never healed.

The Walkers behind me scatter. Simply cease to exist. Like smoke in wind.

Auntie—Akna—crouches away from the light, making sounds that aren't quite words. 

It's giving me a chance.

I run.

I burst out the door and into the suffocating snow, my truck keys already clutched in my hand as if they had materialized there. The engine roared to life on the first try. A miracle or some other form of interference, I didn't know and I didn't care. It wasn't until I was half a mile down the road, the tires crunching on the packed snow, that I dared to glance into the rearview mirror. 

Her cabin sat dark and silent, a solitary stain against the vast white expanse. But in the single window, I could see her, a stark silhouette standing perfectly still, watching me flee. She was waiting.

It's my full-time job, I charge $3500-$5000 depending on package. This is how I pay my bills.

My friend Marcus (30M) got engaged three months ago. We've been friends since college, not super close anymore but we still hang out maybe once a month. His fiancée Lindsay (29F) I've met a handful of times, she's nice enough.

Last week Marcus texts me asking if we can grab coffee. We meet up and after some small talk he says ""so Lindsay and I wanted to ask you something."" I already knew where this was going.

He says they're getting married next June and would love if I could be their photographer. I said congrats, I'd be happy to, let me send you my pricing and packages. He got this weird look and said ""oh we were hoping you could do it as like, your wedding gift to us.""

I laughed because I thought he was joking. He wasn't joking.

I said Marcus my wedding packages start at $3500. That's not a wedding gift, that's my job. He said yeah but we're friends, and photographers do friends and family discounts all the time.

I said I can give you a friends discount, I'll do my basic package for $2800. That's already $700 off. He said that's still too much, they have a tight budget.

I told him I'm sorry but I can't work for free. Wedding photography is 10-12 hours on the day, plus editing which is another 20-30 hours. I'd be giving you like $3500 worth of labor for free.

He got kind of annoyed and said other friends have offered to help with the wedding for free. His cousin is doing the flowers, Lindsay's friend is making the cake. I said okay but those are gifts they chose to offer. You're asking me to donate my professional services.

He said I was being selfish and that real friends help each other out. That if the situation was reversed he'd help me. I said Marcus you work in IT, if I asked you to build me a custom website for free as a birthday gift would you?

He didn't answer that. Just said he thought I'd be happy to do this for them and he's disappointed in my attitude.

That was four days ago. Yesterday Lindsay texted me saying she's hurt that I don't value their friendship enough to do this one thing for them. That it's not like I'd be losing money since I'd be there anyway as a guest.

I responded that I wouldn't be there as a guest if I'm photographing. I'd be working. I can't eat dinner or have drinks or enjoy the party if I'm shooting. She said I'm being dramatic and it's not that hard to take some pictures.

Not that hard to take some pictures. Like I don't spend hours editing and curating galleries. Like anyone with an iPhone could do what I do.

Now Marcus is telling mutual friends that I'm refusing to help with their wedding and being stingy. A couple people have reached out saying maybe I should just do it to keep the peace.

But I do this for a living. If I photograph every friend's wedding for free I'd go broke. And honestly the fact that they're acting like I'm being unreasonable is pissing me off.

AITJ for not giving them free wedding photography?

1p271by,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p271by/dibble_in_the_fisherian_runaway/,Dibble in the Fisherian Runaway,"The rain on Vel'kara never fell straight. It spiraled down through the neon-lit towers in luminescent ribbons, making the whole city look like it was melting. I stood at the edge of the bio-garden, my coat already soaked, and wished for the hundredth time that Reba had sent literally anyone else.

The body was on a pedestal.

That was the first thing that bothered me. Not on the ground, not hidden, just displayed. The victim was a Thross named Elix, their crystalline carapace carefully split open like a geode, internal organs rearranged into a pattern that would've been beautiful if it wasn't made of someone's insides. Bioluminescent moss had been tucked into the chest cavity, still glowing softly in the rain.

The second thing that bothered me was that nobody else seemed bothered.

""It's a Canticle,"" one of the Vel'karan investigators said, their translator rendering the term with an odd reverence. ""Post-mortem bio-art. Controversial, but legal with proper consent documentation.""

""Did he consent?"" I asked.

""The scanners detect no struggle. No foreign DNA. No weapon residue."" The investigator gestured with three of their six arms. ""Natural death, artistic modification. We're simply checking if the Canticle license was filed correctly.""

I looked at the body again. At the way the organs spiraled outward. At the peaceful expression on what remained of Elix's face.

""Natural death,"" I repeated slowly.

""Yes.""

""On a pedestal.""

""The artist likely moved the body for—""

""What's that smell?""

The investigator paused. ""Smell?""

I walked closer, ignoring the forensic drones that beeped irritably as I crossed their scan lines. There it was again—faint, organic, wrong. Like fruit rotting inside a metal can. It didn't belong in this sterile garden where every plant was genetically sculpted.

""You don't smell that? Fruit and metal?""

The investigator consulted a readout. ""The atmospheric filters show standard organic decomposition, automatically classified as irrelevant. Detective Dibble, I assure you our systems are quite sophisticated—""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""I'm sure they are.""

I etched out some sketches on my notebook, the kind that didn't filter anything out because human xenobiology was still mostly guesswork and cross-contamination—and marked the case as open over the investigator's protests.

That night, in my cramped apartment that smelled like recycled air and instant noodles, I learned that Elix had been an art critic. A good one. Three weeks ago, he'd published a review of K'tharr's latest exhibition, calling it ""technically flawless and spiritually hollow—perfection without pulse.""

K'tharr was Vel'kara's most celebrated biosculptor.

I drank my coffee and stared at images of K'tharr's work. Living sculptures that breathed and grew and slowly shifted over years. Pieces that sold for more than I would make in a lifetime. Art that made people weep.

I booked an appointment for the morning.

K'tharr's studio was a cathedral of controlled life.

Everything hummed at exactly the right frequency. The air was precisely calibrated. Sculptures grew in crystalline vats, their geometries perfect, their bioluminescence timed to heartbeat rhythms. I felt like I was walking through someone's circulatory system.

K'tharr himself was tall and elegant, his segmented body moving with liquid grace. ""Detective Dibble. I've been expecting you.""

""Have you?""

""Elix's death is tragic. I assume you're investigating whether the Canticle was... authorized."" K'tharr led me through the studio, past sculptures that seemed to watch us with eyeless awareness. ""I can tell you immediately—it was not my work.""

""No?""

""Observe."" K'tharr projected a hologram of Elix's body, rotating it slowly. ""The organ placement mimics my style, yes. The spiral follows my mathematical ratios. But the execution is amateurish. The symmetry is forced. The integumentary connections are crude. This is a forgery by someone who studied my work but lacks the vision to truly understand it.""

I watched the hologram spin. ""Who would want to forge your style?""

""Vor'lek."" K'tharr said the name like it tasted bad. ""A... rival. He works in industrial scrap-sculpture. Very loud. Very angry. He publicly called Elix a 'K'tharr sycophant' last week."" He paused. ""I believe humans call this a 'motive.'""

I was writing notes when I noticed one of K'tharr's assistants—a bio-engineered creature bred for studio work, all steady hands and temperature regulation—was sweating. Just a single drop, rolling down what might've been a temple.

Our eyes met. The assistant quickly left the room.

""Genetic flaw,"" K'tharr said dismissively. ""I'll have it corrected.""

I spent two days on Vor'lek.

The sculptor's studio was everything K'tharr's wasn't—chaos, heat, noise. Vor'lek welded together scrap metal and discarded tech into massive, aggressive pieces that looked like they were trying to escape their own frameworks.

""Elix?"" Vor'lek laughed, a sound like grinding gears. ""That pretentious shell-polisher got what critics deserve. Turned into the art he loved so much."" He gestured with a plasma torch. ""K'tharr's work is sterile, Detective. No risk. No blood. No honesty. At least whoever killed Elix had the guts to make it messy.""

Everything about Vor'lek screamed guilty. The rage, the jealousy, the opportunity.

Everything except the alibi.

During the window of Elix's death, Vor'lek had been livestreaming a twelve-hour welding performance. Thousands of viewers. Grid logs. Time stamps. Ironclad.

I sat in my apartment, staring at the photos of Elix's body, and admitted I had nothing.

The Vel'karan authorities were closing the case. Unauthorized Canticle by unknown artist. Move on.

But that smell. That wrong, organic, human-noticeable smell.

I pulled up Elix's medical records. Recent prescription for Thyzinol, a common Thross painkiller for carapace repairs. I wrote it down in my notebook, and made a note to call for some info from Special Investigation. 

After some arguments about learning to use a scanner, I got the information I needed from Headquarters about Thyzinol.

Thyzinol + BioNutri-Gel (common in biosculpture studios) = volatile compound. Distinctive odor. Fruit + metal.

I sat very still.

The Vel'karan, however, relied entirely on their perfect scanners. They were too specialized, built to filter out irrelevant cross-species contamination, and would never flag an interaction between something alien and something mundane. They never saw the threat of Thyizol, a substance volatile with everything beyond its own planet.

K'tharr used premium BioNutri-Gel. If Elix had Thyzinol in his system and came into contact with that gel...

I called the investigator. ""I need a warrant for K'tharr's studio. Now.""

""On what grounds?""

""On the grounds that you missed something.""

K'tharr was polishing a sculpture when I returned, this time with three Vel'karan officers who looked deeply uncomfortable with the whole situation.

""Detective! Still investigating poor Vor'lek?"" K'tharr's voice was amused. ""I assure you, his alibi is quite solid.""

""I'm not here about Vor'lek."" I walked through the studio, past the vats and sculptures, until I found the assistant from before. The one who'd been sweating. ""I'm here about Thyzinol and BioNutri-Gel.""

The assistant went very still.

K'tharr's expression didn't change. ""I'm afraid I don't follow.""

""Elix was taking Thyzinol. You use BioNutri-Gel in your work. Separately, they're harmless. Together, they create a compound that smells like rotten fruit and corroded metal. Your scanners filtered it out as irrelevant… My ‘scanners’ were better."" I pulled up some papers on chemical analysis. ""Elix came here, didn't he? To confront you about the review.""

""This is absurd—""

""You sedated him with your own tools. Performed your 'Canticle' while he was alive but paralyzed. Then you moved the body. But you got gel on your hands, and it reacted with the medication in his system. The smell transferred to the crime scene."" I gestured to the assistant. ""And your helper here knows it. That's why they're sweating. That's why they're terrified.""

The studio was silent except for the hum of the vats.

Then K'tharr moved.

Not toward me, but toward a control panel. ""He called my work dead, Detective. Hollow. Without pulse."" His elegant voice cracked. ""I gave him perfection. I gave him transcendence. I made him into art that will be remembered forever—""

""You murdered him because he gave you a bad review.""

""—and you, you primitive, you with your crude sensors and your inability to understand beauty—""

K'tharr hit the sterilization protocol.

The studio filled with enzyme clouds, designed to dissolve biological evidence. But K'tharr had forgotten about the contamination, the Thyzinol-BioNutri compound that had soaked into his workspace.

The enzymes hit it and went wild.

Foam erupted from the vats. Sculptures began dissolving, their careful geometries collapsing into soup. The perfect, controlled environment ate itself in a chaos of chemical reactions.

And in the back, behind a curtain I hadn't noticed before, someone screamed.

I ran.

Three more victims, Thross like Elix, in various stages of ""artistic transformation."" Conscious. Aware. Slowly being turned into sculptures over weeks of careful, agonizing work.

""GET THEM OUT!"" I grabbed the nearest one, their partially-opened carapace leaking fluids. The Vel'karan officers rushed forward, all training overridden by horror.

We fought through dissolving art and choking foam and K'tharr's screaming about perfection being destroyed. We dragged the victims out into the rain, where the spiraling drops washed away the enzyme clouds and the victims took rattling, grateful breaths.

K'tharr collapsed in the doorway, his elegant body coated in the dissolving remains of his own art.

The rain was still falling sideways when the medics finally cleared the scene.

One of the Vel'karan officials approached me, their translator units rendering their voice as carefully neutral. ""Our systems are... sophisticated, Detective. Precise. Specialized. How did you see what they missed?""

I lit a cigarette, knowing it was against at least six local regulations and not caring. I was covered in foam and blood and the kind of stink that would take weeks to wash out.

""Your systems were built for a perfect world,"" I said, watching K'tharr being loaded into a transport. ""Mine were built for everything else.""

The official was silent for a moment. Then: ""The victims will survive. Because of your... mess.""

""Yeah."" I took a drag, tasted rain and smoke and victory that didn't feel clean. ""Survival's messy. Perfection's brittle. Your people forgot that.""

I feel compelled to share my frustrating experience with the JURA ENA 8 fully automatic coffee machine, hoping to prevent others from making the same mistake.

JURA is known as a premium, high-end brand, but my experience with the ENA 8 has been nothing short of a disaster. It's essentially junk (""brol"" in Dutch). 

* **After 2 years:** The machine broke down for the first time. It required an expensive repair costing €250.
* **After 3 years (1 year post-repair):** The exact same problem has resurfaced. The machine is broken again. 

This is unacceptable for an appliance in this price range. I expect a Swiss top brand to last longer than two to three years. The design has major flaws (the brew group is not removable for cleaning, leading to residue build-up and malfunctions), and the repair costs are ridiculously high. 

For comparison, we have a different JURA model at my workplace that runs perfectly, so it's not the brand in general, but specifically the ENA 8 model that seems problematic.

If you are considering buying an ENA 8: **DO NOT DO IT.** Invest your money in a more reliable brand or model (I'm now looking at the Philips 5400 LatteGo myself, which is much cheaper and easier to clean).

I want to meet people I can genuinely connect with, laugh with, and grow alongside.

I’m 5’11”, mestizo, balbas sarado, curly-haired, and currently finishing my master’s at UP while working in fintech. I work out regularly, practice Aikido often (peaceful conflict resolution), and recently got into Muay Thai (amazing stress reliever). I also just discovered how fun hiking can be, pushing yourself to reach the next view, then peacefully waiting for your companions to arrive. My main cardio is swimming to stay balanced (and sane). I don’t smoke, but I enjoy an occasional drink or a coffee catch-up.

I’m drawn to people who are curious, open-minded, and emotionally self-aware. I value good conversations, the kind that flow from random memes and interesting facts to deep talks about life and purpose. It’d be great if you know a Philippine language other than Tagalog; I’d love to learn about your culture and a few words along the way.

I love watching movies (recently: Frankenstein, Quezon, Magellan), reading manga (Chainsawman, One Piece, Grand Blue), and listening to bands like Neck Deep and Cup of Joe (my playlist is mostly angsty or forlorn). I love to sing, even if I’m still practicing during karaoke sessions, hehe. I also love cooking food and brewing coffee. If you have a kitchen I can borrow, I’ll bring the ingredients and make something we can share.

If you’re also in your healing era, or looking for new friends who value authenticity over pretense, or just someone to enjoy your hobbies with, let’s start there. Hatakin niyo ko, kaladkarin ako",1,1763654642.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

I’m passionate about shipping fast, building usable products, and iterating based on real user feedback.

I’m looking for a cofounder, or even a small team, to build something real together.

Ideally, I’d like to team up with someone backend-leaning to complement my frontend strengths, but I’m flexible and even multiple cofounders could work if the vibe is right.

A bit more about me: I’ve worked on both small startups and large-scale projects. At the moment, I’m part of the founding frontend dev team at a startup I joined early on, where I helped build products that have been sold for €10M+. This experience taught me how to scale projects, balance speed with quality, and focus on building real impact.

After several coffee and breakfast meets ,She. 25f asked me 60m out for a date. I WILL SEE IF THE AGE DIFFERENCE AFFECTS  THE DATE.
I stopped by a florist on my way to pick her up ( I am old school )
I pick her up at her home around 6:30 pm. She had a nice home. A dog and a cat met me at the door as she answered. I gave her the flowers and she acted very surprised and said they are lovely and gave me a quick hug. She. looked up at me and made the come here motion. As I bent towards her she kissed my cheek. She went to her bedroom and, said I am just about ready to g o  ,have a seat. As I set down her cat jump on the couch next to me. And looked at me.like it was waiting on me to do something . She came by my hand and rubbeed it head against it..  Her dog did a thorough smelling of me for his  approvial as well . I did a small laugh and thought well I got their ok.About 10 minutes past and T came out
 and  said ok I'm ready. 
We walked to the car. She bumped into me as I open her door. She looked at me for a second smiled and said you don't have to do that.  I said I know. I shut the door after she was seated. As. I started the car I noticed she hadn't buckled up. So I.leaned over the console bent towards her she smiled and leaned her head towards me as I grab the seat belt and buckled her in she says oh ok. I told her I didn't want anything to happen to you. She smiled again and said looking out for for my safety ?thank you. As we drove to the theater  we talked about our day what we did, and little smsll talk. She was   humming to a song on the radio. And kept glancing my way. At the theater we parked she gets out of the car and walks over to my side of the car. As I open the door she pulls the door completely open and Sir. I get out of the car and she shuts the door, puts her arm around mine and said shall we. She held my arm tightly as we walked, I notice she put one of the flowers behind her ear. I told her she looked lovely.  She squeezed my arm and said thank you  you never commented on how I looked before.. I told her I thought you knew cause I Iook at you all the time I am with you. She squeezed  my arm again and said thank you.
I bought the tickets and we walked to the concession stand. We got sodas, one big tub of popcorn ,she imsisted, and a candy. We took our seats just as the light were lowering. I put the popcorn in her lap and told her my arms are longer I  can reach over here, she said ok, grabs my hand puts it around her  shoulders, and says this will make  it easier. I agreed as my finger tips lightly rubbed her shoulder. As the show starts she laid her head on my shoulder. I looked around briefly and noticed  others were looking our way. I tolder her we are being watched .T looks around and does a soft laugh. You want to give them a show.  I said nope not here. She said come here I want to whisper something .  Leaned towards her and she lightly kisses my lips.That will give them something to discuss. I almost said yes there this old long haired guy molesting his daughter.  But I knew better.
We enjoyed the show and held hands as we walked back to the car. As we approached the car she said get you fob out to open the door and go to your side and a I'll open my own door. Ok is all I said.
She suggested we go to a club for a couple hours, I agreed 
As I go in the rock music hits me. I loved it. There were maybe two people in there close to my age. The rest were 20's to maybe 40's
Waitress comes over and gets our drink order ,she's a Rum and Coke I drink scotch and soda on the rocks. We talked and laughed as she holds my hand ,when I hear a woman's voice hollering T... T looks up and recognized 3 of her friends. They come over to our table and hug each other. They ask  T if they could join us .T looks at me I said it's fine with me. They set with us and join the conversation. T introduces her friends to me. One of the ladies look at me , smiles and says to T.. so this is the guy. T puts her head on my shoulder and hugs me and said yes it's him. One of the girls setting  next to me says I like your long hair are the curls natural. Mind if I touch them. I said fine.she continue to compliment my hair as I noticed T and the other women whispering.The woman next to me starts to give me the 3rd degree trying to find out everything about me. I feel uncomfortable answering her and try to be not very forthcoming with my answers..
 I look at my phone and its midnight I suggested to T we might want to go and I show her the time she agrees and tells her friends good night. One of the women tells her laughing don't do anything I wouldn't do. T looks at her and says I am not that loose. And they all laughed. We leave and get into my car.I had nursed one drink all night T had about 4 and is a little loopy. She starts to sing with the radio. 
As we get to her door  T plays with a button on my shirt ands tells me she loved the date and asked if we could go out again I told her sure I really enjoyed her company. She then  asked me to come in for a bit and I said ok. She goes into the bedroom and comes out in a T- shirt and sweat pants and a blanket. She ask me to stay and watch TV with her.I agree. She gets all the pillows and put some by my head she puts one by me and puts her head next to me. The cat is on the back of the couch. The dog. Is at T. Feet. And a blanket is over both of us.  T turns the lights off and just the light of the TV is on.  T said she really did enjoy tonight I told her I did also she snuggles up close to me . I put my arm around her. She continues I didn't know if you were going to kiss me or not I leaned in and kissed her again a little longer this time..we kissed for about30 mins and talked.T and her pillow slides down to my lap and gets comfortable there.  I'm dozing off and notice T  is  asleep.
 I wake up in the morning from the sounds of  metal on metal.  I look up and T is coming towards me with a cup of coffee I reach out for it and she pulls it back and gives me a kiss and says good morning. I said you might not want to do that my breath is probably terrible she told me to go into the bathroom and gargle if you want. I told her thanks I need the use it also.  While I was in there she said I hope I didn't wake you last night. I had to adjust my pillow because there was a nice bulge in your pants.  I ignored her. Then said yes it was my bilfold and keys  T laughed. And said by the way I made you breakfast. Toast and eggs. 
I tried to freshen up and came out and enjoyed the breakfast. 
She is very nice and sweet woman  very independent doesn't rush into things. I thought. If I wanted to make love to her she would want to as well. But let's see if a physical relationship can play out here I am in no hurry.  After breakfast T walked me to my car and gave me a big kiss. I told her I was going out of town for some personal business and I would call her when I got back. She reminded me hey I owe you a dinner. I said I remember and drove off waving to her. Ok the age difference didn't seem to bother either one of us. We will continue what do you all think?

However, the UK 4pm sunsets are already taking their toll, so I’d like to switch my Wednesday 10-20km long-run & Friday’s speedwork session into the mornings, preferably sunrise around 7:30. 

Call me lazy but the reality is I’m not likely to wake up a couple hours beforehand just to get some decent fuel in, I’ll likely just take a bite of something small to settle my stomach & have a coffee and head out. 

I know my body is capable of running in the mornings, it’s more just about how ‘good’ my runs will be. I’m wondering how (if at all) not fuelling up for a long distance run or a speed-work session that involves sprinting, will affect my results and whether I’ll absolutely crash in the post-run recovery.

Now instead of setting across from me at the table she sets next to me. Touches my arm, grabs my hand when she laughs. She has kissed me on the check a couple of times when leaving. Yes I feel the vibes. She even pays for some of the meals.
 A few days ago  as I  was waiting for her , the waitress asked how old my daughter was. Ughhh. I didn't correct her I just said her age. 
Yesterday T said, ""well apparently you aren't going to ask ,can we go on a date, at night, somewhere besides a resturaunt. I will even pay"".  I asked her why me, she said I enjoy your company ,you behave like a gentleman, I've never been around someone like you.
I told her how about a movie she said fine. I told her I'd call her in a couple of days and discuss where ,when, time and what movie.

I am a 19 year old teen, came from a tier2 city to study. Initially I did not had many friends and so much social anxiety ! Got 2-3 friends on the way but my safety anxiety remained the same. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', just type in the location and all stats in one place. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

But I need your guys help to build this community and your reviews, so if you liked the idea or product you can drop a signup or feedback in the comments!

If you don't please queue up in the comments to yell!

First Responder Depression

By BR.Giga



The darkness is not a creature,

not a shadow hiding in a corner,

not a movie-version villain with a neat origin story.

It is quieter than that,

a slow leak in the ceiling of the mind

that drips at 2:14 AM,

steady enough to keep you awake,

soft enough that no one else ever hears it.



Some nights I swear I can smell the shift happening,

like the metallic bite of winter air outside a station bay,

the way diesel fumes cling to a jacket even after you wash it.

Maybe that is memory intruding again.

Maybe it is just the brain trying to explain itself

the only way it knows how.



First responders do not talk about depression.

We joke about overtime and bad coffee,

we talk about the call that made us late for dinner,

we talk about the rookie who puked,

but not the silence afterward.

Not the drive home where the world feels too bright

or too dim

or just a little off from the angle you used to know.



There is a kind of loneliness that grows

in the cracks between siren wails.

It starts small,

like the dust gathering around the boots you never unlaced,

and then it widens,

slow as February ice spreading over a pond.



I remember a hallway once,

white tile, humming lights,

a mother holding her breath so hard

her whole body shook with it.

No one teaches you what to do with that sound.

No one tells you where to store it.

So you tuck it into the same mental drawer

where the smell of blood lives

and the feeling of gloves snapping on too slowly

and the heaviness of being five seconds late

but still being the one who carries it forever.



The darkness knows those drawers.

It opens them when it wants.



Some mornings I wake up feeling like I never left a scene,

like my feet are still planted on that cracked driveway,

breath fogging under a dim porch light,

radio static buzzing in my ear,

my hands doing the work before my mind can catch up.

Other mornings I feel nothing at all,

which scares me more.



People say,

“You chose that job, must be tough,”

like toughness is a shield

and not a thin, fraying coat you wear in a storm that never ends.



Truth is,

toughness is the lie we tell ourselves

to keep from admitting how tired we are.

How the darkness does not arrive with thunder.

It slides in quietly,

through the space between two heartbeats,

through the silence after a code,

through the long walk back to the truck

when no one is speaking

because no one can trust their voice yet.



I have known nights when the world went still

in a way that didn’t feel peaceful,

nights where the only sound was my own pulse

and it felt like a countdown.

I have sat in my car outside my house

unable to open the door

because stepping inside meant being a person again

instead of a uniform,

and I wasn’t sure which one hurt more.



But here is the part that feels like truth.

Real truth.

The kind that sits heavy in your palms.



The darkness is not unbeatable.

Not all-powerful.

It is only strong when it convinces you

that you must carry it alone.



Every time I have spoken aloud

the weight I wished I could hide,

the room changed.

Someone nodded.

Someone sighed.

Someone said, “Yeah, me too,”

in that tired voice that sounds like gravel and hope.



There is light,

small, stubborn, human light,

in the hands that reach back

when yours start to drift into the dark.



I write this for anyone who has ever stared at a ceiling at 3 AM,

blinking against memories they never asked to keep.

For the ones who wash their uniforms twice

trying to get the night out.

For those who carry names, faces, addresses

like stones in their pockets.



The truth is simple,

and it hums like those old fluorescent lights

in a station kitchen nobody repaints.



You matter.

You always did.

You still do.



The darkness knows your name,

but so does the light.



And the light,

even when it flickers,

even when it’s dim,

even when you can barely see it,

has never once stopped trying

to reach you.",1,1763654161.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

I’m an Italian frontend developer currently based in Berlin, with 6+ years of professional experience working primarily with React and Next.js. Over the years I’ve also worked across the broader web stack and I’m comfortable taking a project from idea to production. I’m passionate about shipping fast, building usable products, and iterating based on real user feedback.

I’m looking for a cofounder, or even a small team, to build something real together. It doesn’t have to be purely technical - I’m open to non-technical partners with strong product sense, business skills, or marketing experience. Ideally, I’d like to team up with someone backend-leaning to complement my frontend strengths, but I’m flexible and even multiple cofounders could work if the vibe is right.

A bit more about me: I’ve worked on both small startups and large-scale projects. At the moment, I’m part of the founding frontend dev team at a startup I joined early on, where I helped build products that have been sold for €10M+. This experience taught me how to scale projects, balance speed with quality, and focus on building real impact. My goal isn’t just to build “cool” projects; I want to create something sustainable that can generate revenue and make a meaningful difference in the market.

I value honesty, communication, and commitment in a team. I’m looking for people who are serious about putting in the work, experimenting with ideas, and learning along the way. I’m also comfortable working remote or meeting in Berlin for coffee or co-working sessions.

If you’re passionate about creating something from scratch, excited to experiment, and hungry to ship, I’d love to hear from you. Even if you’re unsure about your skill level, reach out — the right mindset and energy matter more than a perfect resume. Multiple people joining the project would actually be even better if the team chemistry is right.

Please DM me or comment here if you’re interested. Let’s chat about ideas, goals, and see if we can build something meaningful together.

Recently I matched with a woman and she started the conversation with a ""Hi (my name)!!!"". I tried getting a conversation going with thoughtful questions based on her profile but she just responded with low effort responses over 24 hours later each response. I ended up asking her to coffee and I got no response. Why even start a conversation with me if you won't put in any effort to keep the conversation going or want to meet?

I've been having this issue with women on Hinge more often than not lately. I used to have many good conversations that would at least lead to a meetup, but now I just get half-hearted replies and the conversation peters out after a few messages back and forth, even if a woman liked my profile first or messaged me first. I know a lot of women don't want to be penpals on the app, and would prefer to meet up, so I usually ask her out after around least three exchanges. So sometimes I think that is why a woman is being low effort on her end so we can just get to knowing each other in person. Is that the case?

I know women are inundated with attention on these apps so I shouldn't take it personally, but it is still frustrating. Maybe everyone is just getting burnt out from dating apps, which leads to lack of effort.

However when it came to the part where she tried to tell me I was saying New Orleans wrong - she tried to correct me ""It's Nawlins, you say it wrong"" I told her that's for tourists & she actually tried to argue with me but then I got up and before I walked off I said ""but OBVIOUSLY you know waaaaaaay more about Louisiana than people who are actually from there.""

What do I need to do?","I have 4 inside cats that are all litter mates. They are 5 years old. I have three litter boxes inside that I clean out 1-2 times a day. 

I got them all fixed when the vet recommended me to, and shortly after I started having issues with one of my boys. He was basically acting like a textbook tomcat. He peed EVERYWHERE. I took him to the vet multiple times and I told them he was acting like he wasn’t fixed, even though he was, and they kept diagnosing him with a UTI. The UTI medication was not working, and he got to the point where he would see the syringe and he would start shaking because he didn’t want to take the medicine. I couldn’t keep doing that to him. I ended up taking him to another vet for a second opinion. 

They tested him for a UTI and said he showed no signs of one, and they thought he may be suffering from anxiety, possibly from the other cats in my home. We got him a feliway plug in and some anxiety medicine. It didn’t work. We were referred to a specialist. 

Lo and behold, I was correct on my assessment of him. He had a receded testicle, and was behaving like a tomcat because he essentially WAS a tomcat. We got him fixed a second time, but since then, his behavioral issues have persisted. He continues peeing everywhere around the house, even though the litter boxes are clean. He pees in the carpet, he pees in my closet, if any clothes are ever left in the bathroom floor he will pee on those, and lately he’s even been peeing in the kitchen. This morning I woke up and he had peed on the mat under the drying dishes. 

I have taken him to the vet for this issue persisting. He essentially said that it seems like it’s just become a habit for him at this point. He said that it would be safe to put him outside, but there’s no way I’m putting my cat outside like that. He’s been inside his whole life. I’ve grown a bit weary of going to the vet after the several bad experiences I’ve had. 

I frequently clean my carpet with pretty much everything you can think of. I’ve tried multiple store-bought pet cleaners, vinegar, baking soda, shampooing my carpet over and over, I’ve even tried coffee grounds. Nothing deters him. He seems to go through phases where he gets better, but it always comes back to this. 

It seems like the only option right now is to rehome him, but I obviously don’t want to do that. My cats are my best friends. But I also don’t want him to do this in someone else’s house. I just feel so fucking defeated.

we wait here, in these spaces. i tap my fingers on the keyboard but no words come out, just the evacuation of feeling. 

i flow from one fugue state to another, letting the waves of the sea rush over my shoulders as i move. roll with the punches of life, find the humor in the surreal, and the serenity of a day which knows nothing, expects nothing, and finds nothing. 

sometimes i dream about nothing too, just wide empty fields with green as far as the eye can see. sometimes, more often than not, i close my eyes to blackness and open them a moment later to startling daylight. and then sometimes, my mind grants me clemency, and allows me to find you there.

maybe this is where you will forever exist to me, in the confines of my mind. but the ghostly pass of your hand through mine is nothing compared to the soft kisses i long to land on the pad of each finger. one by one, slowly engulfing you with want and warmth to stave off the winter.

we lay together, tangled into one, sheets messy and pillows on the floor. the sweat keeps us heated, but i still push my head into your chest in search of more warmth and comfort. earnestly seeking to merge with your mind first with words, then with spirit, now with body. 

i can imagine the texture of your hair under my palm, arms reaching up towards you, tucking myself under one until i drift into peaceful sleep. 

you, waking me a few hours later with new fire in your veins, a new desire to devour. me, gently stroking hand turning to grabbing fist, twisting and yanking your hair as you move downwards. making you hiss as you bite my hip in retaliation. slow lazy drawls of “good morning, sunshine” muttered with shaky breaths and trembling hands, passing over your head and gripping at your shoulders.

later, i crawl under your desk for comfort as you work. blanket wrapped around my shoulders, two hoodies, still desperate for your body heat. repaying my dues in kind - even as you tut for disrupting your workflow, you still push your chair back to afford me easier access. i bask in the guilt and the affection, cuddling up to your leg as i begin my assault.

cooking up something warm and maybe a little spicy as the twilight passes into evening, chores and (urgent) tasks for the day done. singing along to some song that i half-know the lyrics for, coming up with some mad adlib to fill the gaps and seeing how outrageous i can get before you kiss me to shut me up. letting you lead me around, tell me what to do, giving me tasks and places to be. 

you might not be here with me, but you exist in every fragile moment just before i wake up, your breath still dusting my cheeks. you're between every page, in every line of the words i write. you're every sip of fresh coffee in the morning, every warm smile from a stranger. your name lingers on my lips like a secret i don't want to share, but a smile i can't contain.

1p26ikz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1p26ikz/making_plusdelta_notes_after_interviews_not_a/,Making “Plus/Delta” Notes After Interviews (NOT a Pro/Con List),"**Hiya recruits!**

Since many folks are starting to roll into interviews now, I wanted to share a quick guide on one kind of reflection/iteration method I always liked that seemed to do a little more for me than a simple ""pro/con"" list. 

This is something I was taught that helps to create some actionable improvement steps between each interview, so you can incrementally improve and micro calibrate your skills as you inevitably have to go through god knows how many of these things. 

# So What is a Plus/Delta List?

When you finish any interview — screener, callback, coffee chat, honestly anything in life that is a repeatable task, whatever — the goal isn’t to judge yourself or catastrophize as to what you ""did wrong"". 

The goal is to iterate. 

The **Plus/Delta** method is a clean way to capture *what worked* and *what to adjust* as *repeatable actions*, (not just what was ""good"" or ""bad"") without slipping into the “I did everything wrong” panic spiral.

**This is** ***not*** **pros/cons.**  
Pros/cons is judgmental.  
Plus/delta is *directional.* It tells you where to go next.

# Why Use Plus/Delta?

Because BigLaw recruiting moves fast — sometimes you have a callback tomorrow. You don’t have the luxury of long debriefs or waiting weeks to process. You need a system that:

* Is **fast to reflect with**
* Is **emotionally neutral**
* Keeps you from overreacting to one awkward answer
* Helps you get *incrementally* better each round
* Builds a repeatable structure for callbacks and follow-ups

This doesn't have to be everyone's cup of tea of course, but I like this as a thought process personally. 

# How to Do It (Takes 5 Minutes)

Right after the interview — like right after you leave the building/close the Zoom — jot these down:

# 1. PLUS (+): An action you did that worked. Specifically what you want to continue doing.

These aren’t brag points. **They’re behaviors you want to** ***repeat*****.**

That is the really key part of this. *Repeatable action you can do again next time.* 

Examples:

* “My answer about tech transactions flowed naturally — keep using that story structure.”
* “I stayed structured to X QUESTION under time pressure.”
* “They seemed genuinely engaged when I referenced their group member. I will name drop again next time.”

**These are repeatable strengths/moves. Bank them. Re-use them.**

# 2. DELTA (∆): What you want to adjust next time

Not mistakes. Not failures.  
  
Just things you want to **change or tighten**.

Examples:

* “My example for teamwork ran long — tighten to 60 seconds.”
* “Forgot to mention specific interest in the office — add that earlier.”
* “Need a stronger ending for the ‘Why this firm’ story.”
* “Practice two sharper questions to close with.”

Deltas are *actionable tweaks*. Not just what you think went poorly (especially if you can't do anything about it, i.e., the interviewer was completely unengaged). This is the whole point of the system.

# Here's a Working Template You Can Copy-Paste Into Your Notes

**PLUS (+)**  
•  
•  
•

**DELTA (∆)**  
•  
•  
•

Use 2–4 bullets max per section. Any more and you’re overthinking it.

# What This Looks Like for a Interview

**PLUS**

* Nailed the “walk me through your resume” question. Keep same structure. 
* Question 2, 4, and 5, got them to talk the most substantively/conversationally. Question 3 didn't. Will keep and cut accordingly.

I just got my very first yeti rambler 10oz. So far I’ve only used it with hot drinks and it works pretty well. One issue - the liquid will not stop oozing to the top of the lid through the space between the mouth piece and the lid. I hope this makes sense. Nothing leaks from the lid itself which is perfect, but I’ll fill up my drink - and since the lid goes in a bit I don’t fill it up all the way to the top or close to the lid - and I’ll close the mouth piece and then bam all of the coffee is coming out through the little space. 

I have it just sitting on my table right now and I can still see bubbles coming up through the side and it’s not even full anywhere near the lid. I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong or if this is normal. The coffee I poured in was not boiling hot or freshly brewed. Just hot enough to drink it right away.

The simple version: MCTs are a type of fat that your body breaks down faster than most other fats, so they can feel like a quicker, steadier fuel source. For me, the effect is more like a smoother mental ramp than a caffeine jolt.



The foods that matter in real life are pretty limited. Coconut oil is the big one. It is naturally high in MCTs, and it is easy to use without changing your whole diet. Palm kernel oil is another concentrated source, but I personally treat it as optional because of the sustainability mess around palm products unless you can source responsibly. Then there is full fat dairy, like butter, some cheeses, whole milk, and cream. These have smaller amounts, but they add up if you use them regularly.



How I add them without overthinking: I start slow. A teaspoon of coconut oil in coffee or tea, or using it for sautéing, is enough to notice whether my stomach likes it. If I go too fast, I get digestive grumpiness, so gradual is key. Dairy based MCTs are even easier because they just ride along with normal meals.



Benefits I actually notice or see people report: a bit more steady energy, less snack panic in the afternoon, and sometimes a clearer head on busy days. The research on satiety and modest metabolic bump is decent, but it is not a magic fat burner. It feels more like a small lever that helps you stay on track if the rest of your diet is solid.



A couple caveats I keep in mind: coconut oil and palm oils are still saturated fats, so I try not to treat them as infinite health food. I also do not use them when my digestion is already irritated. And if you have any medical conditions that make fat heavy foods tricky, this is a talk to your clinician situation, not a Reddit experiment.



If you have tried food based MCTs, I am curious what you noticed. Did it help with energy, cravings, or focus, or did it feel like hype.

But being unemployed just means I have that much more time to practice my piano and writing skills! 

And for every minute that I am \*not\* currently trying to be productive, I hop on games like Warframe, ARC Raiders, Anno 117 or Monster Hunter Wilds.

I was wondering if it would be a good idea to reach out to them and ask about the interview process and the department in general? Or would this not be considered good?

They were always very lovely to me which is why I don't want to cross any boundaries or make them uncomfortable. 

Would this message below be considered okay? Or should I not reach out to them at all?

1p25pgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1p25pgc/gods_voice/,God’s Voice,"The rally was a triumph.
Every time he raised his fist, the crowd roared like an earthquake.
Some fainted from emotion; some grew so wild that the police had to drag them away.
He watched the chaos with an arrogant smile, pleased, and stepped off the stage.
Praise and gratitude flooded toward him, which he accepted as no more than his due.
He slid into his luxurious car, lit a cigar, and headed home.

A third term was nearly guaranteed.
Next would be the presidency of the entire continent.
The dream was almost real now.
The man was euphoric.
He possessed the throne of a god on earth, and he intended never to relinquish it.

The next morning, he woke as usual and got into the car.
Shrill music assaulted his ears—the interior shook with deafening rock.
The driver, who normally shrank under his gaze, was cheerful, even whistling along.

“Turn it off,” the man commanded, pompous and irritated.

But the driver didn’t seem to hear him at all.
He kept whistling, kept driving.

“Turn it off! You’re fired! Do you want to be charged with treason?
I’ll bury you in prison for life!”

The driver didn’t react in the slightest.
He drove on and eventually stopped before the enormous gate.
Still whistling, he opened the rear door—like unloading luggage—and pointed.

“Here you go.”

Bewildered, the man sat at his workplace—the gigantic chair behind the gigantic desk,
the very spot where he had once humiliated a foreign delegate on live television,
the place where he had proven to the world he was its king.

A knock.
A woman carrying coffee entered, chatting with a colleague.
No obsequious smile.
She set the saucer down with a loud clatter and walked out without ever looking at him.
Anyone behaving like that on any other day would have been fired instantly—
or sued into ruin.

Maybe I’m dreaming, he thought, pinching his cheek.
He checked the mirror.
His usual arrogant, imperious face stared back.
The face of a king.

He went to another rally.
He raised his fist and unleashed a barrage of insults—
against enemy nations, the wealthy, the elites.

But the cheers never came.
Not a clap.
Not a shout.
People simply continued their own conversations.

Then suddenly, a great cheer erupted.

Slow, he thought irritably, forcing a generous smile and waving grandly.
But the crowd’s eyes were fixed not on him—
but on the baseball game playing on the giant screen behind him.

No one saw him.
He had vanished from their world.

This is a dream.
A bad dream.
He repeated the words to himself as he left the hall.

His phone rang.
It was the foreign minister of a country currently negotiating a trade deal.

He made his usual lofty demands—
and the minister replied in a calm, flat voice:

“Put the person in charge on the line.”

“Do you know who I am?
Is this a declaration of war?
Who do you think you’re talking to!”

Without reacting to his fury, the minister simply repeated:

“You heard me. The person in charge.”

The man’s voice reached nowhere.

⸻

The “President” won its third term,
became president for life,
and the lord of the continent.

But no matter how the  man shouted, raged, threatened, sneered,
or raised his fist—
nothing ever came back.

In time, somewhere, the man died.
No one noticed when.

He became a god on earth, just as he wished.
Congratulations.
May he receive eternal blessings.

end.

1p25p2l,https://i.redd.it/9d91a5vkgf2g1.png,Is Yorktown Worth the Drive from DC?: The American Revolution Edition,"If you've been watching [the American Revolution](https://wetaplus.org/show/the-american-revolution/) documentary from Ken Burns, the answer a resounding YES. 

The story of Yorktown is the story of the conclusion of the Revolutionary War: it's where the British finally threw in the towel in October 1781.

*Fun fact: General Cornwallis was so embarrassed about losing that he didn't even show up to the surrender ceremony – he sent his second-in-command, Charles O'Hara, to hand over his sword to Benjamin Lincoln (who was Washington's number two). Awkward!*

When you're ready to visit the town where it happened, we have a few recommendations to check out while you're there:

1. **The Poor Potter**
2. **Oscar de Mejo’s refreshing take on the Revolution**
3. **The Custom House**

**The Poor Potter:** Here's a head-scratcher for you: this place was founded by William Rogers, who was *not* poor and *not* a potter. So... what's up with the name? And why did Lt. Gov. William Gooch let this factory even operate? Honestly, nobody really knows. It's one of those historical mysteries that makes you go ""huh."" 🤔[The Poor Potter Site - Yorktown Battlefield Part of Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. Nationa…](https://www.nps.gov/york/learn/historyculture/the-poor-potter-site.htm) 

**Oscar de Mejo’s refreshing take on the Revolution:** When you visit the American Revolution Museum at Yorktown, don't miss the ""Fresh Views of the American Revolution"" exhibit. It features artwork by Oscar de Mejo, an Italian immigrant who was commissioned to illustrate a 1976 book by Paul Foley. His perspective on American history? Totally different and totally worth seeing. [The Art of Oscar de Mejo | Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, VA](https://www.jyfmuseums.org/events/special-exhibits/fresh-views/oscar-de-mejo)

**The Custom House**: This beauty was built in 1721 by Richard Ambler (who collected taxes for the Port of York River – not the most popular job). It's actually one of only two known colonial storehouses left in Virginia. [Yorktown Custom House](https://comtedegrasse-dar.org/customhouse.html)

Yes, Yorktown is famous for its Revolutionary War history, but there's way more going on these days. We're talking about farm-to-table restaurants, cute coffee shops, and charming places to stay. It's not just a history lesson – it's a legit getaway spot.

I'm constantly debating just buying one and always at the last second I'll change my mind and refrain. Like, I'd be in the car on the way to the vape shop and then I'd change my mind and get gum instead. Or I'd be in the bus and plan to get off one stop before my usual stop to get a vape before heading home but I end up just staying in the bus and wait for my stop. I think part of it has to do with my eating habits. I wish I could just go back to replacing the sweets I eat with vaping. To be fair my eating habits when I was vaping wasn't great either because I have other issues going on, but at least back then I had the vape to curb some of it. Now I find that I drink black coffee a lot just so I could taste SOMETHING throughout the day and I don't always have sugar free sodas. 

I was fine the past 4 months but I think this all started again because I had one(1) cigarette like 2 weeks ago. I didn't even like it and it didn't even make me feel good. But I guess it reminded me of how vaping DID make me feel good in contrast. It's so frustrating because literally a few days before that my friend offered me a hit of her vape and I refused because I genuinely didn't want it. now, I'd totally take her up on her offer. I think vaping is so stupid and embarrassing but I want to do it so bad anyway. It doesn't help that I'm stressed and unhappy a lot these days. Somehow I think vaping would help with that but part of my stress is financial so no, it most definitely won't help.

* Appreciate the history, bridges, buildings, and parks that make this place home

It’s part art, part tour, part love letter to the city.

Since that time, extensive archaeological and historical research has given insight into many aspects of seventeenth-century life at the mission. Mr. Lee will share what we have learned about the diets of both the Apalachees and the Spaniards who lived at the mission for nearly 50 years. The resulting artifacts, such as colonoware blending European and Apalachee designs, reflect the deep cultural fusion that characterized life at Mission San Luis.* 7pm

She made me track it for a week. Turns out: 30 to 40oz daily max. Most of it coffee or tea (which are mild diuretics).

For my body weight (152lbs) I needed at least 75oz daily.

Started tracking properly using WaterMinder with reminders. Set goal for 80oz. Front loaded mornings (20oz before coffee, another 20oz by 11am).

After 3 weeks:

Afternoon crashes reduced by maybe 70%. Still get tired but it's manageable, not debilitating.

Energy more consistent throughout the day. No dramatic peaks and valleys.

Headaches that I thought were normal? Gone.

Skin looks better as a bonus.

I feel stupid that something so simple made such a difference. I spent months trying complex solutions when the answer was basic hydration.

WaterMinder is nothing special. Just reminders and a progress tracker. But I needed that external accountability. Without it I'd forget to drink for 6 hours straight.

Anyone else discover hydration was the missing piece? I can't be the only one who overlooked something this basic.",0,1763650866.0,selfimprovement,8,0.38,False

1p25clq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p25clq,My haul from Thailand,"I spend 3 weeks in Thailand and the craft chocolate scene is really booming. Cocoa is being grown all over Thailand and made into chocolate locally. What's special about Thai chocolate is the sheer range of flavours you get. Depending on the region, it can taste classically 'chocolatey', but a lot of them of them are actually quite bright and fruity.

Photo 2: Oligin is a brand that's new to me. I got it because the beans are grown in the North-East and are quite hard to find (most beans come from the South where the climate is better). I've never had them so looking forward to try.

Photo 3: Paradai is one of the most established Thai brands. It's the smoothest chocolate I have ever tasted, it's really quite something on your tongue. In a blind test, it stands out immediately because of that.

Photo 4: Amber's is a very small brand that only sells online and has a  single vending machine in Samyan Mitrtown. I last had it 2 years ago and it was really delicious. Back then I think it was a mix, but now they do single origin. This particular bar comes from the East.

Photo 5: Rila Kakao is a brand that I first discovered 3 years ago at fair in BKK. Their Ubon (East) bar is very easy eating and the Chiang Mai (North) one is more complex with a lovely smokey flavour. This time I decided to pick up the rest of their range (. 

Photo 6: Roast Niyom I stumbled upon at a local craft fair. The chocolate is from a single plantation in Phetchaburi (West) and their bars have notes of tropical fruit. They have been growing cocoa for 9 years and making chocolate for 3. Not shown here, since it was out, but we also tried some matcha-white chocolate that was truly delicious (think Royce but 10x better). This was truly a discovery. The owner was incredibly kind and generous with both his knowledge and his chocolate.

Photo 7: Fair Chocolate in Song Wat (BKK) came recommended by friend and was great fun. They create micro batches from all over Thailand. Every week they get new chocolate in and when it runs out, it's gone, only to be replaced by another. This to me is the essence of Thai chocolate: small harvests, constantly changening flavours, and the joy of never tasting the same bar twice.

Thai chocolate isn't on most people's radar yet, because the harvest is small and hardly any of the chocolate gets exported. But one can see the same happen as with Thai coffee:  But you can already see the same pattern as Thai coffee: a food-obsessed country starts growing its own beans (not indigenous, but perfectly suited to the climate) and creates coffee and chocolate that can stand alongside the best in the world.",4,1763650846.0,chocolate,1,1.0,False
1p25cbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJoseSharks/comments/1p25cbx/more_sharks_hat_tricks/,More Sharks Hat Tricks!,"With Macklin Celebrini's unstoppable heroics, I thought I'd look up some Hat Trick stats for the Sharks.

\*  The Sharks have now amassed 85 hat tricks in their history.

\*  Rob Gaudreau had the first one, vs. Hartford on Dec 3, 1992.

\*  The first Playoff hat trick by a Shark was by Ulf Dahlén in round 2, game 3 vs. Toronto, May 6 1994.

\*  Rob Gaudreau had the second one, vs.  Quebec on Dec 12, 1992.  Not only the second Sharks, hat trick, but one of the greatest comebacks ever to fail in the league.  The Sharks trailed 6-1 midway thru the 2nd period, got two, gave up one, and then got 4 straight to tie the game 7-7, only to lose with 41 seconds left in OT.  Notable goal scorers in this game were the first 1OA ever to play for the Sharks, Dean Evason, current NY Rangers coach Mike Sullivan and Nordiques forward Mike Ricci!  Notably not hitting the scoresheet was Mats Sundín, who had gotten a point in every one of the Nords first 30 games.  8 goals, he got nuttin, honey.  His 30 game point streak remains #5 in NHL history.  ESPN could do a 30 for 30 on this game alone.

\*  Mack has 3 of them, the last 3.

\*  The all time leader for the Sharks is Jonathan Cheechoo, who amassed NINE of them in just over 3 years.  Patrick Marleau is second with eight, Tomas Hertl is third with six.

\*  Other notable multi-hats are Joe Pavelski with 5, Timo Meier and Logan Coture with 4, Gaudreau, Evander Kane, HOF Jumbo and Owen Nolan with 3 each

\*  Cheech had a run of 5 straight SJS hat tricks.  He had another of 3, as did Pavelski and now Macklin.  Nobody else had 4.  Come on, Mack!

\*  Meier had 5 goals in one game, a Sharks record.  Others with 4 are Hertl, Marleau, Kane and Nolan.  Marleau got all 4 in the 3rd period.

\*  The shortest interval between hatties is by Hertl who got one vs. PIT on Jan 15, 2019, and then another at WAS on Jan 22, 7 days later.  Alex Ovechkin had already registered a hat  trick of his own in this game, Evander Kane got a game tying goal in the last second, and Hertl got the hattie in OT.

\*  The longest interval between Hat Tricks by one Shark is Jumbo, who got his second on October 27, 2010, and his third on February 18, 2019, over eight years and about 660 games later.

\*  7 times, the SJS hatties have been the only 3 Shark goals in the Game.  Marleau, Logan Coture, Mack, William Eklund, Hertl, Scott Thornton (yes, he had one) and Alexi Yegorov (who?).

\*  Yegorov's was the least likely.  The pride of Leningrad had an 11 game NHL cup of coffee in 1996, totaled 6 points, these were the ONLY three NHL goals of his illustrious career (2 on the PP)... We really thought we had a player here!

\*  Scott Thornton's was the only SJS Hat trick in a game that resulted in a tie.  This came before the Shootout was introduced.  3-3 final

\*  Erik Karlsson had one.  It was the only Hat Trick achieved by a Sharks Defenseman.  Too bad EK65 couldn't really play any defense.

\*  Joel Ward was the first Black player with a SJS Hat Trick.

\*  Mikkel Bødker was the only Danish player with a SJS Hat Trick.  He's also the first on the list alphabetically.  Denmark is the least represented country on the list, this was it.

# The $2 Tuesday Pack

This week features the book ""The All-Clear"" by Oleksandr Grekhov. Additionally, a postcard of the famous Snake Island stamp joins a .50 cal keychain made by Arcaist. The casing comes from an operation carried out by ""UFL's"" GUR unit in which they cleared a russian position. 

No raffle pack would be complete without a patch collection, so we have a patch from the 95th as well as a tryzub patch. You should also recognize by now the crochet work of Arcaist's mother, whom I adore, in the blue and yellow keychain.

# The $10 Extenuating Circumstances 82nd Swag Pack

**With russia doing its best to knock out alllll of Ukraine's power, we have an unholy number of requests for power stations that cost €750/$870 a pop. Hence the $10 pack instead of a normal $5 pack: we want to keep our defenders powered up and functional as best we can.**

The 82nd went all-out to show their appreciation for you consistently generous support! A signed flag, t-shirt (size L), hip flask, coffee mug, two patches, small flag, and large wall clock make this one of the richest packs we have done in a very long time!

Note: unfortunately, the clock mechanism was somehow damaged during transport, so it will need to be replaced.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p24zeh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p24zeh,My brain before and after coffee,"I ran a small experiment on myself yesterday morning and did two brain snapshots: one before coffee, and one about 40 minutes after. Thought I’d share the patterns I noticed in case anyone finds it interesting. I’ll drop screenshots in the comments.

**Before coffee:**

• High beta was elevated and a bit scattered across frontal and right areas.  
• Alpha response was very low (3%), which made it harder for my brain to settle into an eyes-closed resting rhythm.  
• Mental strain index was 0.59.  
• Engagement was on the higher side but not very stable.

**After coffee (40 minutes later):**

• High beta didn’t increase, it smoothed out, especially frontally.  
• Beta overall looked more coherent instead of noisy.  
• Alpha response jumped from 3% → 10%  
• Mental strain dropped slightly (0.59 → 0.53).  
• Engagement stayed about the same.  
• Fatigue index went up a bit (1.97 → 2.12), which I think makes sense after stimulation.

1p24zbt,https://v.redd.it/6xxsvzp1oe2g1,I made a Mac app that shows beautiful battery alerts,"Hey folks,

I'd like to share my first ever app I've been working on over the past month: Juicy - a small battery utility with beautiful alerts at any percentage you choose.

I wanted battery alerts at 20%, 15%, 3%, hell even 1% if you like to live on the edge. And I wanted them to actually look good - not just the boring system notifications. macOS only alerts you at 10% and 5%.

So I built an app and called it Juicy. Each alert has this nice glow effect and a custom sound vibrant enough that you'll actually notice and go grab your cable. The alerts themselves are these little notification pills that bounce onto your screen.

**What it does:**

* Set custom battery alerts at any percentage you want (20%, 3%, 1%, 80%, whatever)
* Beautiful notification pills with screen glow effects and attention-grabbing sounds
* Clean compact iPhone-style battery icon in menu bar with percentage inside
* Menu Bar dropdown that shows time remaining, battery health tracking, cycle count, temperature monitoring

**Why I built this:**

I'm a digital nomad and work from coffee shops, trains, planes etc. all the time. I love to squeeze the last juice (no pun intended) out of my MacBook battery. But I hate when it suddenly dies, so now with alerts at 15%, 5%, 3%, and 1%, I actually run to grab my charger when that 1% notification pops up haha.

You can also use it for the opposite - like an 80% alert so you know when to unplug and keep your battery healthy long-term even though there might be better apps for that.

It's built natively in Swift. Uses basically no CPU. Just does its thing quietly in the background.

**Pricing:** $4.99 one-time (no subscription) with 3-day free trial. Here's the [app store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juicy-battery-alerts-health/id6752221257).

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1p24v46,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1p24v46/matcha_grades_for_lattes_etc/,Matcha Grades for Lattes etc.,"My coworker recently returned from japan with i believe uji matcha or yugen matcha(i'll find out for sure later). After that just today I went to Haan Coffee in Orlando FL and they had a houjicha latte available for their fall special. I tried it and it was fuckin delicious! Anway, after all that i've finally decided after a year of being a barista and getting fairly knowledgable with espresso that i'd finally pay attention to our leafy brothers.

The question I have starts here: Do you really need a ceremonial grade matcha for the best tasting drink?  
From my understanding as well as personal experience so far, standard culinary/ latte grade matcha honestly tastes fine. As long as you're not skipping prices so hard that you get the vomit colored powders, I haven't felt like the flavour or texture of your run of the mill matcha is that bad. BUT! with that in consideration, the matcha my coworker brought from japan tasted SUBSTANTIALLY better in both a latte as well as a cortado I made for myself.

Lastly taking all that info, how far do you really need to go when purchasing a ceremonial grade matcha? Where's the start and where's the finish on quality and pricing.

Any input is greatly appreciated and soz if this is formatted like shit idrk how to do any of it properly LOL

He is, I think, anxious-avoidant and his words definitelly do not support his actions which were loving and future-oriented (plannig trips, buying furniture according to my taste lol). Breakup was friendly and he wanted to stay close friends but I couldnt. He even said that loosing me feels like an eclipse...

We stayed on friendly 'hi' basis and went more-less no-contact for 2 months. A week ago I asked him for a walk and he instead suggested coffee. It was wonderfull, fun, 90 minutes long coffee where he laughted from belly, joked, was warm and bantering. He insisted on paying (but he does that with everyone). He didnt reach out after but yesterday I jokingly congratulated him International men day and left him space to banter. He answered with a joke which I replied to and he then just closed converdation with an emoji. Like, it was so cold and dismissive after that warm long coffee... I don't understand how that happens? Why did he even agree to coffee if he doesn't actually want to communicate with me?

I decided to look at this like to an experiment where I am gonna go slowly and friendly and see if I can get him more intimate by New year...but this kind of sudden coldness from a guy that was really wonderfull at coffee confuses me so much.

so earlier this evening nakita ko nagpop up yung message nya hinihingi gcash ng lip ko. papadala daw sya pangkape. nagsend pa ng pic ng starbucks and she said nagkape daw sya and naisip nya si lip ko.


I told my partner na I don't think that's normal  and he said baka daw dun sa biro na pakape which we all know normal naman.

I don’t need grand romance. I don’t need soul-tie-level commitment. I just want to go outside with a human being who can talk, laugh, and not make me wish I stayed home. We don’t even have to end up liking each other — I literally just want the experience and the serotonin.

- Socially & politically aware (bare minimum, pls)
- With car (preferred) or at least the ability to travel without acting like it’s a heroic quest
- Actually knows how to hold a conversation
- Taller than me

If you think we’d vibe (or at least not hate each other), shoot your shot. I love cats, coffee, and I'm passionate abt manga/manhwa reading & bedrotting.

Worst case: we get outside. Best case: idk, maybe we accidentally vibe and do it again.

I woke up this morning and found my fridge off, and my coffee maker off. I plugged an outlet tester into the outlets, and it indicates an open ground on both outlets. Things have been working for almost 2 years, without issue since I've replaced all the outlets and GFCI outlets with some professional help. 

Could anyone offer some ideas on what could be the cause of a sudden ""open ground"" on some outlets?

I pulled the two outlets in question, and visually confirmed there are no loose wires, or wires that are touching. I also flipped nearby GFCI outlets, as a simple troubleshoot, outlets still read the same. My place is small, so it's possible I didn't flip the correct GFCI, but I'm a little doubtful. 

It has been raining fairly hard the past day, and I'm worried that there could be a roof leak. Which is a pain considering I live in a Condo. 

I flipped the breaker the outlets are on for the time being, and ran an extension cord for my fridge to a different outlet for the time being. Just brain storming where I should start when I get home. Thanks! ",1,1763649325.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

I was seeing someone in a more casual dynamic in the last few months. To give some context I am 26 year old female and he is 54. We have been going out to coffee dates and have been intimate. I have been trying to move states so I know this current relationship is not something we have agreed to make extremely serious.  I have asked questions about his previous relationships and other things. He is divorced and his ex wife is getting remarried. Every other previous relationship talk he gets mad. He gets really defensive and angry when I ask anything. I have heard from him he has this female friend who he babysits her child and he has admitted to helping her buy a car. I have noticed he has been a lot less engaged with texting and our dates are much shorter. I also have noticed he has been extremely mad when I ask if he is seeing anyone else. I have communicated that it is ok to see others as long as we use protection and the person is tested etc. I honestly do not mind if it's another causal dynamic as long as they are being safe sexually. I feel concerned I'm in a home wrecking situation. I feel like he maybe in a serious relationship or engaged or something. Am I being paranoid or do you sense that I could be onto something. I feel like it is crazy to hook up with someone who gets so angry when you are just making sure you are all being safe. ",1,1763649099.0,whatdoIdo,17,1.0,False

1p24jbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoatingAndSailing/comments/1p24jbb/why_i_stopped_living_on_a_boat/,Why I Stopped Living on a Boat?,"For a long time, I dreamed about living on a boat. The idea felt magical: waking up to calm water, watching sunsets every day, hearing waves instead of traffic, and feeling totally free. I thought living on a boat would be peaceful, adventurous, simple, and cheaper than living on land.

And to be fair, sometimes it *was* all of those things.

But after more than a year of living onboard, I eventually decided to stop.  
This post is not to discourage anyone — living on a boat can be amazing.  
I just want to share the **real reasons** why I personally stopped living full-time on a boat.

Maybe it helps someone who is considering it. Maybe it gives clarity to beginners.  
Here is my honest experience in simple words.



# ⭐ 1. Constant Maintenance Became Exhausting

Living on a boat is like living in a house that’s *always falling apart slowly*.

Boats require constant attention:

* Something leaks
* Something squeaks
* Something corrodes
* Something needs tightening
* Something breaks at the worst time

On land, you may fix something once every few months.  
On a boat, it feels like **every week** something needs repair.

Between:

* Pump issues
* Battery problems
* Mold
* Plumbing leaks
* Hull cleaning
* Rope replacements
* Engine maintenance

…I realized I was spending more time fixing things than actually enjoying the water.

Maintenance became a lifestyle instead of part of boating.



# ⭐ 2. Weather Controls Your Life

On land, if it rains or gets windy, you simply close your windows.

On a boat?  
The weather becomes your boss.

# Wind decides your day.

# Tides decide your schedule.

# Storms decide your plans.

# Rain decides your sleep.

There were nights where I couldn’t sleep because:

* The boat was rocking too much
* Strong wind made the ropes scream
* Waves slammed against the hull
* Rainwater tried to sneak in

I got tired of checking:

* Weather apps
* Radar
* Wind speed
* Tides
* Anchors

Living on a boat means **you never fully relax during bad weather**.



# ⭐ 3. Space Felt Smaller Over Time

At first, small spaces feel cozy.  
After months, the same space starts to feel tight.

Living in a boat means:

* Small kitchen
* Small bathroom
* Small storage
* Small moving area
* Small fridge
* Small everything

I missed simple things like:

* Walking around normally
* Standing up fully everywhere
* Cooking with more than one pot
* Long showers
* A normal bathroom
* Stretching

Over time, the small space became mentally draining.



# ⭐ 4. Privacy Is Hard to Find

If you live with a partner or family on a boat, privacy becomes a luxury.

There’s no:

* Separate rooms
* Soundproof walls
* Quiet corners

If someone is cooking, you hear it.  
If someone is talking, you hear it.  
If someone is stressed, you feel it too.

A boat turns every small argument into a big one because you can’t walk away.



# ⭐ 5. Unexpected Costs Add Up

Many people think living on a boat is cheaper.  
Sometimes it is… but not always.

Here are the hidden costs I didn’t fully expect:

* Marina fees
* Mooring fees
* Fuel
* Engine repairs
* Insurance
* Hull cleaning
* Safety equipment
* Solar setups
* Battery replacements
* Tools
* Ropes, lines, anchors
* Dinghy repairs
* Boat storage
* Coast guard requirements

A small repair can easily become a **$300–$700** repair.  
A yearly maintenance routine can reach **$2,000+** quickly.

Living on a boat is cheaper only if:

* You anchor out often
* Your boat is reliable
* You are handy
* You don’t travel long distances frequently

For me, costs slowly went up over time.



# ⭐ 6. Daily Life Takes More Effort

Living on a boat means regular tasks need more work:

# Cooking

Small pans, tiny stove, limited water.

# Laundry

Not on the boat — usually at marinas.

# Groceries

Carrying bags across docks + dinghy rides.

# Using the bathroom

Either tiny onboard head or marina bathrooms.

# Sleeping

Depends on the weather.

# Wi-Fi

Not always stable.

Daily life becomes a series of small challenges that eventually drain you.



# ⭐ 7. Safety Concerns

Some things made me nervous:

* Anchors dragging at night
* Boats drifting too close
* Engine issues far from shore
* Sudden storms
* Slippery decks
* Unexpected wakes
* Nighttime navigation

Over time, the stress built up.

Living on land, you take safety for granted.  
Living on a boat means **you constantly think about risk**.



# ⭐ 8. Social Life Shrinks

This surprised me the most.

Living on a boat is peaceful, but also isolating.

I saw people less because:

* Friends visited less often
* I stayed near marinas more
* Moving around was harder
* Weather changed plans
* I had fewer spontaneous meetups

Eventually, I realized I missed simple social things:

* Coffee shops
* Regular restaurants
* Events
* Friends
* Family
* Casual hangouts

Boating life can be beautiful — but also lonely.



# ⭐ 9. I Wanted Comfort Again

After months of living on a boat, I started craving:

* A normal bed
* Hot showers
* Reliable electricity
* Full-sized kitchen
* A couch
* Strong Wi-Fi
* A washing machine

None of these things exist in the same way on a boat.  
I wanted daily life to be simple again, not an adventure every week.



# ⭐ 10. I Realized I Prefer Boating… Not Living on a Boat

This was my biggest lesson.

I realized I love boating.  
I love sailing.  
I love exploring water.  
I love weekend trips.

But living full-time on a boat is a **completely different lifestyle**.

Some people love that lifestyle.  
Some people thrive in it.  
For me, I realized I needed:

* More comfort
* More space
* Less stress
* More stability
* A home that feels grounded

I didn’t stop boating.  
I only stopped **living** on a boat.

Now I boat for fun, not out of necessity — and I enjoy it more than ever.



# ⭐ Final Thoughts

Living on a boat taught me a lot:

* How to be patient
* How to fix things
* How to handle stress
* How to live simply
* How to love the ocean in a deeper way

I don’t regret it at all — it was one of the most unique experiences of my life.

But for me personally, the challenges became bigger than the joys.

I still boat often.  
I still love the water.  
I still recommend the lifestyle to anyone who wants to try it.

But living on a boat full-time?  
I realized it wasn’t the right long-term lifestyle for me.",1,1763648839.0,BoatingAndSailing,0,1.0,False

It’s lightweight, looks premium, and the locking sip lid keeps it from leaking in my bag. The stainless steel body feels strong, keeps coffee hot for a long time, and the slim shape fits easily in cup holders. I also like that it comes in different sizes and colors, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus.

**Pros**

* Very lightweight but still feels tough and well made.
* Locking lid is leakproof, so it’s safe in a bag.
* Insulated stainless steel keeps coffee hot and smooth to sip later.
* Slim, travel-friendly shape fits most cup holders.
* BPA-free and dishwasher safe, plus lifetime warranty for peace of mind.

**Cons**

* The lid has moving parts, so you need to rinse it well to keep it clean.

If you want a coffee tumbler that is light, leakproof, and long-lasting, Stanley is a solid choice. It’s easy to use every day, stays strong over time, and makes carrying hot coffee simple and stress-free. This post contains Amazon affiliate links.

Since some years of brewing espresso i’ve also discovered the world of pour over coffee! I mainly use a v60 but also own a Aeropress and enjoy some cold brews during the summer months! 

I’ve been using my DF64v for both espresso and other brew methods but i want to switch it up and get a seperate hand grinder for my non-espresso coffees.

I thought I made my decision to get the Kingrinder k6, since it seems the best budget option (now €85 on amazon). But since I continued my research on here, i’ve seen the Mavo Phantox Pro, 1zpresso J-Ultra, 1zpresso X-Ultra and Timemore C or S (series?) been mentioned here aswell. To be honest, i’m completely overwhelmed now and have no idea what the best choice would be for me…

I’ll probably drink light to medium roasts most often and i prefer a balanced cup. I’m still exploring my taste preferences (body/clearity etc) so a something that’s versatile and/or balanced would be best i think.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences and suggestions! Thanks ☕️

1p24dxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1p24dxl/10_small_health_changes_that_make_a_massive/,10 Small Health Changes That Make a Massive Difference in Northern Ireland,"Here’s the truth nobody tells you: most people in Northern Ireland don’t need a complete life overhaul to feel healthier.  
You don’t need a gym contract, a juice cleanse, or a morning routine that looks like it belongs on TikTok.

What *does* work?  
Tiny changes, small enough that you don’t notice you’ve done them, but big enough that you feel them after a few weeks.

Here’s the NI version of that list. No nonsense. No pressure. Just stuff that works here, in this wee cold country.



# 1. A 15-minute walk after eating

Not a workout.  
Not a power-walk.  
Just a gentle “round the block”.

Benefits:

• boosts digestion  
• reduces bloating  
• helps regulate blood sugar  
• improves sleep  
• genuinely lifts your mood

Even if it’s lashing outside, a quick dander to the shop and back is perfect.



# 2. Swap one drink a day for water

Just one.

Not all of them.  
Not a full overhaul.

One.

It could be:

• the mid-morning Diet Coke  
• the afternoon coffee  
• the late-night squash  
• whatever you use to “break the day up”

After a week, you’ll notice:

• clearer skin  
• fewer headaches  
• better energy  
• reduced snacking

That’s it. Just water.



# 3. Take a vitamin D supplement

This is Northern Ireland.  
We do not get enough sun.  
We all know this.

Vitamin D helps:

• mood  
• immune system  
• energy  
• bone health  
• sleep regulation

It’s cheap, safe, and nearly everyone here benefits.



# 4. Eat one piece of fruit a day

Not “five a day”.  
Not a rainbow bowl.  
Just *one*.

Most NI folks don’t meet even the first fruit or veg serving daily, so fixing that one change makes a huge difference.

Apples, bananas, berries, pears, you don’t need to enter farmer’s market mode.



# 5. A 10-minute tidy for mental health

This one’s underrated.

Set a timer.  
Pick a spot, a drawer, a shelf, a countertop.  
Blast through it.

Your brain LOVES small wins, and visual order reduces:

• stress  
• decision fatigue  
• anxiety  
• overwhelm

A tidy kitchen counter is basically therapy.



# 6. Add one protein source to each meal

Protein keeps you full longer, stabilises blood sugar, and supports muscle.

Easy NI-friendly options:

• eggs  
• chicken  
• fish  
• lentils  
• yoghurt  
• beans  
• turkey slices  
• cheese

Butchers special deal packs work great too.



# 7. Go to bed 20 minutes earlier

Not an hour.  
Not a full sleep routine.  
Just 20 minutes.

Sleep runs your:

• hormones  
• hunger  
• mood  
• stress  
• energy  
• cravings  
• immune system

Most health improvements start with sleep, not diet.



# 8. Cook one extra portion and freeze it

It’s future-you’s dinner.  
Saves money.  
Stops snack panic.  
Stops takeaway temptation.

It also makes you feel like you’ve got your life together, even when you absolutely don’t.



# 9. Reduce doomscrolling after 10pm

Simple rule:  
If you’re scrolling and you can’t remember what you started looking for… bed.

Late-night scrolling:

• spikes stress  
• messes with sleep  
• increases anxiety  
• reduces morning energy

Swap 10 minutes of scrolling for calming music or a slow wind-down. It’s shocking how quickly your mental health lifts.



# 10. Drink one warm drink before bed

Not alcohol.  
Not caffeine.

Something gentle:

• peppermint tea  
• chamomile  
• warm milk  
• honey water

Your nervous system loves warmth.  
It signals “safe, relax, sleep”.

Your sleep gets deeper, and your mornings get easier.



# Final wee message

Health isn’t about perfection, diets, or going full gym influencer.  
It’s about small choices repeated often.

In Northern Ireland, that means:

• walking even if it’s raining  
• eating something simple  
• drinking a bit more water  
• organising wee bits of your life  
• cutting screen time  
• adding small healthy habits, not removing everything you enjoy

Do a couple of these for a month, and you’ll feel it, mood, energy, motivation, everything starts shifting upward.",1,1763648462.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

# First Date

After matching on hinge, we set up a date pretty quickly. I was pretty smitten the moment I saw her. I knew she was very smart since she was in her final year at an Ivy League law school. The conversation was great and at the end of the night she invited me back to her place for amazing sex.

# Second Date (first warning sign)

After the first date, I was hooked. And apparently so was she. We met up again, had dinner, then went back to her place. We were having sex when she said, ""I am such a slut for you, baby,"" which I found a bit unusual since it was only our second date and already she is dropping ""baby"" but I felt flattered.

Following the once again great sex, I asked her what she was looking for.

Keep in mind at this point in my life (32 years old), I decided I am done with casual flings and want to find my life-partner. Regardless, when she said she just came out of a four year relationship 2 months and said she wasn't looking for anything serious, I ignored it.

She said, ""I am emotionally unavailable -- sorry if that's not what you want to hear""

Then, I lied. I said, ""Well, I am not sure what I am looking for either,"" since I didn't want to fumble this. However, it's clear at that point I should have sacrificed the great sex and ego boost (what guy doesn't want to bang a hot lawyer?) and been honest about my needs, but I stayed.

# The First 4 Months (Situationship)

We started seeing each other basically weekly, though at times she would disappear. For example, she was studying and said she wouldn't be around for two weeks. So for two weeks I kept the distance, didn't text, and just fretted over how she felt about us. But after the two weeks, it was back on. Dates, great sex, staying at each other's place.

It was a dream but also a nightmare. She was a very cool person with a blessed life. It's worth noting I live in NJ and she lives in NYC, and that her last relationship was long distance -- in hindsight, this was another massive red flag. I learned, of course, that avoidants engage in LDR so they can leave easily. Still, where she was in NYC was convenient for my location in NJ.

Then she said she's looking for apartments for when she graduates and had three options: two would have been manageable distance wise for the relationship, the third was in Brooklyn. I knew if she chose the BK apartment, it was over.

Well, she chose the BK apartment and my heart sank, but I played it cool.

It's also worth noting at this time, I am buying every dinner. I took her to a super fancy steakhouse when she passed her finals and on her last day of class, since she was a student and I hoped some day in the future she would reciprocate (Spoiler: even when started working her 250k a year job, she always expected me to pay despite her being self-proclaimed ""progressive."" The money thing was always very weird with her, despite her coming from a very privileged background).

# The First Breakup

After four months, one night immediately after sex she said, ""I am moving to Brooklyn and I really don't seeing this going on""

Then we had our first real convo and I saw another AA red flag -- she has the ""phantom ex,"" her first relationship.

I was devastated and pissed. I felt betrayed. I thought we were working towards something. The way she show \*\*physical\*\* affection, the kiss emojis in our texts, the spending so much time together.

Anyway, I was destroyed.

# The First Comeback

I was crying, depressed, my world was completely flipped upside down. I never reached out to her, just tried to accept it. Then a week later, she texted me saying she made a big mistake. I couldn't believe it honestly. Because her dumping me fit with the narrative I have about myself, that I am unlovable.

Of course, I jumped right back in. We then met each others friends and put a label on what we were.

But then things changed. We never argued in those first few months. Then, once we go into a relationship, it seemed we were always arguing. I don't know what happened. It's worth noting she definitely had a bit of a drinking problem, and most of our arguments would happen when there was drinking involved.

It just felt different. She seemed upset a lot of the times, though would never open up about anything. If I asked what was wrong, I was met with sarcasm and anger. It was extremely hard. She also just became hyper-critical of me. For example, after hanging out with her friends \*\*on one occasion\*\* she said, ""you're not as talkative as I would have thought."" Also, when she referred to where I lived, she would say it's ""all the fucking way uptown,"" clearly sort of indicating it was an issue -- which is funny, because I mostly went to her place to make the distance easier for her. 

# The Second Breakup

A week into her high-profile job, she dumped me. I could something was wrong that night. She was just in a terrible mood. The light in my bathroom requires flipping the switch a bit since it's an older apartment -- she knew this. Then she comes over and tries to flip the switch and just goes ""fuck man."" 

I can't even explain it, but I just got this vibe she was seething underneath and any attempt I made to support her was met with contempt.

Then she dumped me after four months (funny how the time period was always more or less the same). Once of the things she mentioned was how she thought I'd be more talkative. She mentioned the distance. She mentioned how she's unhappy, implying I was the cause.

This time, I was completely suicidal. I felt even more rejected than before, since now she knew me on a deeper-level, we actually tried the relationship thing and she said ""nope."" I lost 20 lbs, could barely work, was calling the crisis hotline everyday, even talking to chatGPT (I have a great support network, but that was not enough). It was the worst period of my entire life.

We said we'd still be friends. She sent a text after saying how sorry she was, etc. 

I just imagined her living her amazing elite lawyer life in her cool Brooklyn apartment. It was torture. I have a view of NYC from my apartment and every time I looked out the window, I just saw it as her city, or rather, a city for the wealthy, the cool people, the talkative people, not me.

# The Second Comeback

Then after two months, I get a text asking if I want to get coffee, on her. I got this point at my lowest point, where I really saw no point in going on with my life other than my family.

Keep in mind, I also make very good money, have friends, hobbies, and a troubled but loving family. But none of it mattered.

So we get coffee and she said how she made a huge mistake, how she's been miserable without me, how her friends noticed her spirits rise when we started texting again. 

Keep in mind, during the break I read A LOT about attachment and learned she was very avoidant.

I also knew this because of her childhood trauma: her mom was late picking her up everyday from school, there was no deep communication in her house, she said her dad was autistic essentially. She also knew her mom cheated on her dad, but her dad had no idea. And overall, she clearly just hated her mom a lot, and would say so explicitly.

I said we should take it slow, but who was I kidding? This was the woman of my dreams.

So we got back together. A week later, following sex, she says, ""I love you. That's why I kept pushing you away."" I couldn't believe it. I thought it was real this time -- now she won't leave like before! She loves me! Oof, was I wrong about that.

It's worth noting she is now working her elite lawyer job, 12 hour days. The only time we can really see each other is on the weekends, and even then she would always have to be near her laptop. And I supported her. Not because I want a sugar mommy, but because I know this means a lot to her. Again, I lied about my own needs. I said I was fine with the hours, with never seeing her, with her answering emails during the dinners I continue to pay for. She FaceTimes me every night, always saying I love you, but I missed spending time with her in person. 

Another red flag I ignored -- avoidants can use their demanding career as a means to get out, just like the distance.

She invites me to her brothers wedding, I go to her holiday party, and it seems good. 

Then comes the arguments again, her drinking got worse, she even started to neglect her hygiene. One time I came over and her feet smelled horribly -- I never encountered this before in the basically year of dating her. It was clear she was becoming more depressed. 

# The Third (and final) Breakup

We planned a trip together for my birthday, and a week before she dumps me. By this time though, I was done myself. She had been treating me like crap, expecting me to do all the work in the relationship, never giving me any grace, etc. She would tell me about her prior partners in the beginning and how they were terrible for X, Y, Z, then proceeded to project that onto me. Anything I did was nitpicked and viewed through a lens of ""How can I make this person the monster I feel they are so I don't need to get close?""

It's worth noting she is extremely intelligent, and she would weaponize this A LOT. She also said how she was neurodivergent and emotions are hard for her. She also said she'd a great therapist, which was hilarious since she never even went to therapy. But of course, it was a protection mechanism -- ""I know all about therapy, so I don't need to go and address my childhood trauma.""

# Healing

That was seven months ago, and it's still very hard. Thankfully, I have a support system as I mentioned earlier, but it's still not easy. I am afraid I will never find someone I care about as much as her. It's also a light on myself and what I value. I used to love bragging about dating the hot, successful lawyer. I was superficial and not honest with my needs. I wanted her to be something she wasn't, and perhaps in some ways got what I deserve.

The truth is, dating is hard. In all the years I have been on the apps, she is really the only person I was legitimately very attracted to physically. This, combined with here being brilliant and funny and loving (sometimes), made it so hard.

Also, quite frankly, entering this period of economic uncertainty, it would have been really nice to have a partner with a stable and lucrative career. I work in tech and worry about layoffs every day. I would try and express this to her and her reply was basically ""you'll be fine"" or even better ""you're chronically online."" Of course, the layoffs have only gotten worse, but thankfully for her, she no longer needs to listen to my bids of emotional support.

One of the most important parts of my healing, though, has been this subreddit. It helps immensely I was not rejected for me, but because she is a deeply wounded person whose own intelligence may prevent her from ever facing the demons that make intimacy so hard.

1p24bfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1p24bfv/cat_2_issues/,Cat #2 issues,"Hoping for help and TIA 

My 4 1/2 year old cat is increasing in toilet behavior issues. In the last 2 years we moved a few times and I thought it was due to stress but it doesn’t appear to be. He has started going #2 outside of the litter box. #1 is always in the box but #2 never is. Sometimes it’s in front of the box. Sometimes it’s in other rooms. Sometimes it’s on furniture. 

At first I, and our vet, thought constipation. But it’s soft. Now it’s started having blood clots in it. Bright red jelly looking. He is acting normal otherwise. 

I have 2 different litter boxes in different locations. I’ve tried covered, uncovered, plastic, steel, 4 different kinds of litter, different foods for sensitivity. I have scrubbed and relocated and torn out carpet at this point. 

I just went on a 3 day work trip and had someone in the house watching him. But he still had 4 piles of poop on the ground upstairs away from where my sitter goes. This morning I had the box wide open. No cover no lid. And he was cuddling me as I had coffee and worked. Then he went upstairs. And I heard him pawing at the ground. I went upstairs and he had pooped again on the ground. 

It’s not constipation or anxiety. He has no problem with the box itself to pee. What is wrong with him? I asked our vet and they offered hundreds of dollars in tests to experiment and find out. I cannot afford that. And I cannot afford for him to destroy my house. I can barely walk through the upstairs hallway because of his smell despite me removing the carpet. Help please.
