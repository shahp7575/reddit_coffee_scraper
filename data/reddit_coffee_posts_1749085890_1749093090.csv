## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right laptop in this price category necessitates a careful evaluation of key features. These are the most critical components to consider when making your selection.

**Processor:** The processor is the brain of the laptop, influencing its ability to handle everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, and multimedia playback.Intel Core i3 and i5 processors, as well as AMD Ryzen 3 and ryzen 5 processors, are common in this price range. Look for models that offer at least a quad-core processor for better multitasking capabilities.these should also be the latest generations of those processors.

The processor’s clock speed and cache memory also play a role in performance. A higher clock speed enables faster processing of instructions, while a larger cache memory allows the processor to access frequently used data more quickly. These together can result in smoother overall performance and improved responsiveness.

**RAM (Random Access Memory):** RAM directly affects a laptop's ability to handle multiple applications simultaneously. 8GB of RAM is generally recommended for smooth multitasking and handling demanding software,though increasingly 16GB would be the optimum starting point. Some laptops in this price range might offer 4GB, but that can limit performance if you anticipate running multiple programs or working with large files.

The speed of the RAM, measured in MHz, also contributes to performance. Faster RAM can transfer data more quickly, improving overall system responsiveness.Ensure the laptop supports upgrading RAM if you anticipate future needs.

**Storage:** Storage capacity and type are critical factors. A Solid State Drive (SSD) is significantly faster than a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD), resulting in quicker boot times and snappier application loading. aim for at least a 256GB SSD,although a 512GB SSD is a more desirable space if you intend to store and work with large files or numerous applications.

While HDDs offer more storage space at a lower cost, their slower speeds can negatively impact overall performance. Some laptops might offer a combination of SSD and HDD, with the SSD handling the operating system and frequently used applications for speed, and the HDD for larger files.

**Display Quality:** The display impacts viewing comfort and productivity. Look for laptops with a full HD (1920x1080) resolution for sharp and clear visuals. Panel type, such as IPS (In-Plane Switching), offers wide viewing angles and accurate color reproduction, making it ideal for content consumption and graphic design.

Brightness, measured in nits, affects visibility in different lighting conditions. A brighter display is easier to view outdoors or in brightly lit environments. Consider a display with at least 250 nits of brightness for pleasant viewing.

**Battery Life:** A longer battery life is essential for users who need to work or play on the go. Look for laptops that offer at least 6-8 hours of real-world usage on a single charge. Battery life can vary depending on usage patterns, screen brightness, and the types of applications being used.

Battery capacity, measured in Watt-hours (Wh), indicates the amount of energy the battery can store. Larger battery capacities generally translate to longer battery life. Consider a laptop with a battery capacity of at least 40Wh for decent power.

1l3ou8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1l3ou8d/aio_or_is_my_bfs_behavior_regarding_work_shady/,AIO or is my bf's behavior regarding work shady?,"i (20F) need some outside perspective on my bf's (25M) behavior is concerning or not. We've been together for 3 years and I’ve started noticing a pattern that’s bothering me more and more.

  


Here are some examples:

* Recently, during a conversation, I asked him what team his coworker Mel is on (since he was the one who was initially mentioning her and also mentioned her brother Ben who's on his team. He was mentioning how they didn't do much work and were constantly chatting getting coffee on another floor). He initially dodged the question and claimed he didn’t know, which seemed odd because he was the one mentioning all these other details about her and her brother and how they worked. I already knew about the brother Ben because they're on the same team, but not much about Mel. I asked again later and he finally said she’s on the finance team and that was that. About 30 mins later I just had a weird feeling and asked why he didn’t just tell me that in the first place (This was all i said in a normal tone). He got defensive and angry and said ""I literally told you after!"" and ""I'm so annoyed right now"" when he was fine before during that 30 mins we were chilling after that convo. 



* A while ago, I caught him deleting a DM from his male coworker on iMessage. I saw it before he erased it, and it said: *“Imma throw a ring at her.”* I asked him what that meant and why he deleted it, and he got annoyed again and said he did it *so I wouldn’t ask questions.* I pressed again, which he vaguely mentioned how there was some pretty girl sitting near his team in the cafeteria. His answer was so vague that to this day I still don't even know what it's referencing exactly and how that really comment really fits into that. I had a weird feeling at the time too but pushed it down after he gave me that answer.



* My boyfriend has a small all-male team at work. During a team bonding event**,** a few of them tried to cheat on their partners, one (Leon) even planned to lie to his fiancée to meet up with a girl at a bar and had his arm around her. Another (Ben) was going to cheat despite meeting his girlfriend’s parents the next day. My boyfriend didn’t participate, he left early, called me, and I fully believe he didn’t do anything shady, which I appreciated.
* The issue for me was his reaction afterward. In the group chat, he joked about Ben “it’d be crazyyy to cheat on her the day before meeting her parents,” and later insisted the other coworker Leon didn’t actually cheat because the girls scammed them for drinks, so nothing happened. But to me, the intent was clearly there, Leon would've cheated if he could've. I don’t understand why my boyfriend is so eager to defend that as “not cheating,” especially when Leon has a whole fiancée.



* I also found a blonde hair in his car. I have dark hair, and he claimed it must’ve gotten stuck to his backpack somehow during his work trip back home. I think that is the case but just wanted to add it for more context for everyone's thoughts. I know he definitely didn't do anything shady during his work trip because he works very hard at his job and takes the work seriously.

Hi all

36f, USA,  combo skin,  constant sun exposure for to area of living (cannot get away, I wear sunscreen inside my house can't get away from it).

I'm currently using Alpyn Instant Bright Eye and Alpyn beauty line filling eye creams. 

I'm not seeing any difference. 

Bright eye helps occasionally but that's only when I have really bad dark circles (intermittent insomnia) and most of the time it really does nothing. 

The beauty line one just feels slimy and heavy. 


I need something for eye that I can put on at day and night that works for wrinkles/crows feet, and isn't super super heavy. I'm tired of feeling like I've slicked butter across my eyes and not getting any benefits. 

I'm not expecting instant/overnight erasure of crows feet (though it would be nice! ), but I do know that my eye area does get really dry throughout the day.

Retinol is not an option for me right now until winter time/ less sunlight- I am just way too sensitive for it (I've tried,  dermatologist told me to avoid if able during summer months cause I get red red red red red that won't go away for ages), even for night use,  my skin will still go apeshit the next day with any sun. 

I drink 3 40oz stanleys a day (it's a struggle lol but water is IMPORTANT), have a decently clean diet (if I don't make it we don't eat it. I cook a LOT),  though I did FINALLY quit vaping (3mo!) So I know that took a toll on my skin.  I do drink wine (2-3 glasses a week), lots of teas, never coffee. 

Budget is 100-200, but it really NEEDS TO WORK.  Sleep or not.

But now I'm at a fork in the road... I kindof hate every coffee table ever.  But I like to have a place to put my wine without worrying it's going to end up all over me. 

This sofa set came with 2 huge cloud-y ottomans, that are kindof unfunctional at the moment. 

I'm thinking maybe I get a big giant walnut tray that is stable (but not permanent) and use that for the drinks, decor, moss bowl/ succulent tray, etc etc.  But that's probably not enough ""table space"" if there's more than a few people eating or drinking.  So do I supplement with end/ side tables on both ends of the sofa?

Scene: College courtyard, early fall. A slight chill. Leaves rustle. A small group of students is gathered.)
Alex (nervously, scratching the back of his neck):
""Hey, um… Jean. How are you doing? Haven’t seen you since summer. Now it’s fall… and I guess I’m falling again.""
(The crowd goes silent. Jean blinks. A soft chuckle escapes her lips.)
Jean:
""Umm… yeah, Alex. That was… a good joke.""
(Cue Paul, overly confident, grinning wide, arms around his girlfriend, Stacey.)
Paul:
""Oh boy, here we go again. The ol’ puppy eyes are back. Everyone, brace yourselves — Romeo's here!""
(Stacey gives a quiet laugh but then gently smacks his arm.)
Stacey:
""Stop it. Be nice.""
Paul (shrugs, smug):
""I am nice. I just don’t care. I didn’t say anything wrong.""
Stacey (crossing her arms):
""You know exactly what you did.""
(Alex watches, quietly. It's the same dance every time: Paul says something mean, Stacey laughs… then scolds him.
But never really pulls away. Alex wonders: If she hates how he acts, why does she still cuddle up to him like that?)
(Stacey turns silent. Paul looks away. Jean turns to Alex again, changing the subject.)
Jean:
""Anyway… it was a great summer. How was yours?""
Alex (with a grin):
""Oh, it was wild. Fought monsters, investigated the paranormal, stopped Desmond from unleashing alien tech — saved the world.
(Cut to reality: Alex was behind the counter at a 7-Eleven all summer.)
Jean (smiling kindly):
""Well… at least you had fun.""
Jean:
""I’ve gotta run. Class is calling. Bye, guys.""
(She walks away. Alex waves. Then turns to Paul.)
Alex:""Come on, man. You're my best friend. Why you gotta call me out like that in front of everyone?""
Paul (laughs, heading off):
""Best friend? Please. You did this to yourself. Anyway, I’m not getting caught in your girl drama. I'm out.""
(Paul leaves. Alex stands alone. He sighs and picks up a small rock from the cracked courtyard stones. Looks up at the gray sky.)
Alex (to himself):
""Fall sucks. College sucks. But hey... class is about to start.""
(He rushes off — late again.



It was a rainy Friday night at CJ’s Diner, one of the most popular spots for any college dorm crowd. Paul and Stacey were obviously together. Stacey was quiet and reserved, while Paul stayed quiet but observant, wearing a classic black and brown combo.
Stacey looked effortlessly graceful, wearing a typical white shirt and blue jeans.
They were the long-term couple — going strong for six years, high school sweethearts.
The school crowd was there, and so was Jean — tall, with long brown hair that curled softly over her shoulders. She smiled with grace and care. Everyone was having a swingin’ time.
Alex walked in.
“Sooo… Paul, thanks for the invite.”
Paul, exaggerating: “Who invites this guy again? Alright, I’ma head out.”
Stacey laughed, brushing his arm. “You’re funny. But stop — be nice.” Then she turned to Alex with a monotone voice, but a warmth behind it. “Hi, Alex.”
Then came Jeremy — long-haired, rugged.
“Paul, you’re such a jerk,” he said. “Leave him alone. Come on, Alex. Sit down.”
Alex tried, “Come on, Paul… you intend me, right?”
Paul replied, “Loser? No. But whatever, I’ma be nice today, I guess.”
As they all ordered food, Alex had a slice of pie with coffee. Jeremy had wings, listening to the soft jazz playing across the room. Paul and Stacey shared pancakes drizzled with syrup, while Paul munched on a ham and cheese sandwich. Alex looked around, enjoying the space and warmth in the air.
Boom.
Alex froze.
He saw her — Jean — walking in through the diner door, laughing with her friends. And just like that, something shifted inside him. His breath caught. It wasn’t just attraction; it was like gravity. A pull. As if the whole room dimmed and she was the only thing glowing.
Time slowed for a second.
Her hair flowed over her shoulders like soft waves, her smile easy and kind. She looked like she didn’t have to try to be beautiful — she just was.
“Guys… she’s here. She’s here,” Paul muttered, finishing his food.
But Alex wasn’t listening to Paul anymore. He was still staring at Jean.
Paul snorted. “Bruh, I feel bad for that girl. She gotta deal with you. Poor girl gonna suffer.”
Alex, timid — like a scared kid reaching for a flashlight: “Shut up, Paul. I’m just asking for an honest opinion.”
Paul shot back, “Yeah, and I’m giving you one, freak.”
Jeremy barked, “Wanker! You’re so rude to him. What did he do to you?”
Paul shrugged, “He was born. And annoying.”
He smirked, “Watch — he gonna go over there like a little boy, say hi, and be weird.”
Stacey, drawn into the conversation: “Why are you always like this, babe? What’s going on with you two?”
Paul shrugged, “Nothing. He started it.”
Alex sighed, “Ugh. Never mind. Sorry I asked.”
“Well guys,” he said, “I made money this week. I’ll pay for the appetizers and stuff.”
Paul lifted his coffee, warm and calm. “Thanks, buddy.”
Stacey smiled. “Yeah, thanks, Alex. Really sweet of you.”
Jeremy grinned, “You got money now, huh? Lol — thanks, man.”
Alex left quietly, picking up the crumpled twenty dollars he’d made doing a quick oil change.

The girl roommate responded with a screenshot with the camera moved to the view of the cats’ litter boxes (which are placed in front of one of the entrances of my bedroom door) and that they just forgot to move it back to the view of the litter boxes after they installed the camera. They said they didn’t text me about the camera because it was late at night and didn’t want to bother me. 

I was totally annoyed about it, but I wanted to be chill and not dramatic. I was still annoyed because even if the camera is out of view of the general area A) it’s still in a common area without my consent first B) it’s in front of one the entrances to my bedroom and C) even if I cannot be seen I could still be heard with convos with friends  if they logged into the live feed or if our motion was being recorded. 

I told the girl roommate about how I felt after they got back and they said they’re not even subscribed to motion detection on that camera and they don’t even really look at it. I let it go after that. 

Well a month later the other night I was mad at the guy roommate for being too handsy and overbearing with me when he was drunk. I unplugged the camera that night because I just had a bad feeling I was being watched. Also if they don’t even really use it like she said it shouldn’t matter right? 

Well that camera with re-plugged the next day. 

Would like some advice if I’m overreacting and if not how I should handle this. ",1,1749092152.0,badroommates,3,1.0,False

Over the last couple of months I noticed that the acidity of the coffee was ruining my gut health. I was having so much stomach irritation. I also sensed my mouth getting uncontrollably dry, to the point where I always felt so uncomfortable. 

With Yerba Mate I don’t have these issues. Obviously it’s still acidic but the effects are nowhere near as bad as coffee for me. 

I’m also getting a more consistent caffeine hit. I love sipping on my Bombilla and refilling my gourd — it really gives you the time to enjoy it.

Most importantly, I’ve grown to love the taste! Prior to this, I also tried Matcha, but that just wasn’t for me. Yerba Mate has a richer taste if you ask me.

1l3ol7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l3ol7g/am_i_the_problem_in_my_friendships/,Am I the problem in my friendships?,"I moved away from my hometown a few years back. I had some friends I had known for over 10 years online I went to visit them after a failed relationship. Ended up hitting it off with one of the guys and moved in with him. I was lonely and struggling to find my place in my new town. Struggling to make friends or find a good job. I had gained a lot of weight too and was getting over the trauma that happened with my ex. Finally after a year I was doing well, had a decent job and was gaining back a good amount of savings. But still was lonely. 

One of my bf’s friends was looking for a relationship and I got the idea to hook him up with someone I knew back home. I showed him a few girls and he didn’t really like them and then I thought about this one girl I was friends with years ago but we hadn’t seen or spoken since I moved here. So about a year and 1/2 at this point since I had been in contact with her. He ended up thinking she was cute I told him a bit about her and he was down to get to know her if she wanted to also get to know him. I said I would reach out to her and I did. I asked if she wanted to get in a game with all of us. She agreed. I’ll admit I didn’t express the intentions to hook her up with my bf’s friend who was going to be playing with us but they actually ended up naturally hitting it off. 

Things were going good between them and she after a few months came here to visit with him. We hung out during this time and things were fine. She eventually did move here and was also struggling to find a job and so I got her a job with me but it just wasn’t for her and I could tell she was stressed and unhappy. She expressed this to me but it was stressing me out so I told her I couldn’t deal with her problems and that I gotten her a job and been paying for her coffee and lunches here and there bc I knew how it felt to not have a stable income but there’s nothing else I can do and for her to stop venting to me bc it was messing with my mental health. 

She ended up not wanting to hang out with me as much as I was hoping. I found myself becoming jealous because she was still close with friends from back home that she had and was making new friends here. She ended up quitting the job with me and starting at a new job. Which worried me because I felt this would distance us further as she’d continue to make new friends. I don’t mean to be that way I guess I’m a bit insecure. But I was right it did distance us more. 

Eventually we stopped hanging out all together and slowly stopping even texting. I ended up trying to text her and my texts weren’t going through as if she blocked my number but she still had me on social media so I assume she got a new number and didn’t give it to me. We go out as a group with our boyfriends and there friends here and there and I confronted her and asked if she hated me bc we never hang out. She told me she doesn’t hate me that she’s just busy and finding her place here. I tried to be understanding but it feels like there’s more than that to her lack of friendship. 

I still haven’t made any friends as every girl I’ve befriended here ends up kinda just being insane and we end up having a falling out. I started making YouTube videos and TikTok’s in attempts to have social connections to distract myself from my loneliness. 

And for my bf, he is very introverted and plays video games all day. We use to do that together but I often want to go out and he doesn’t. I just struggle with friendships so badly and I don’t get why? Am I the problem?

1l3ojwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l3ojwy/apartment_1413/,Apartment 1413,"The faded pink robe, a garment of plush decay, clung to Amelia Finch like a second skin, or perhaps, a forgotten dream. Its belt, a casualty of some long-lost laundry cycle, had vanished into the ether years ago, leaving the fabric to hang open, a silent testament to its abandonment. Beneath this flimsy shroud, the delicate lacework of her panties, a sliver of dark silk against her pale flesh, offered the only true embrace. At twenty-eight, Amelia was an edifice of the average; her body neither sculpted by the gods nor blighted by disfigurement, merely… functional. Her face, a composition of soft, unremarkable features, held a certain plainness, a canvas too often left unpainted by the brush of strong emotion. Yet, amidst this landscape of the ordinary, two startling prominences asserted themselves: her breasts. Naturally ample, their perky uplift defied the gentle tyranny of gravity, crowned by areolas of a tender pink, puffed like miniature soufflés, from which, in an exquisite inversion, her nipples receded, drawing inward, secrets whispered only to the soft confines of her brassiere, or to the cool caress of the air when the robe slipped aside. Her skin, from nape to ankle, thigh to abdomen, was a landscape meticulously denuded, shorn bald, a velvet-smooth expanse maintained with an almost surgical devotion.



Her apartment, number 1413, was a testament to curated detachment. Sunlight, when it deigned to visit, poured through the expansive, uncurtained windows, illuminating dust motes in a slow, celestial dance. No fire escape beckoned, no balcony offered a precarious perch; just glass, steel, and the sprawling, indifferent city beyond. The decor spoke of stark elegance: polished concrete floors, minimalist furniture with razor-sharp edges, a single, oversized abstract painting on the wall that seemed to hum with suppressed energy. It was a stylish cage, immaculate and silent, reflecting back to Amelia a life lived in exquisite, almost painful, order.



Her days unfolded with the precision of a clockwork mechanism, each hour a cog in the monotonous wheel of her solitude. Morning began not with an alarm's vulgar shriek, but with the subtle shift in the ambient light. She’d rise, the plush robe sighing around her, and move to the kitchen with the quiet grace of a specter. The ritual of coffee-making was her first prayer: the rhythmic thrum of the grinder pulverizing dark, fragrant beans, the delicate gurgle of the water as it dripped through the filter, each drop a tiny measure of time. The bitter aroma filled the air, a fleeting, potent warmth in the cool, still apartment.



Seated at her crystalline glass desk, the laptop became her portal, its screen a blinding rectangle of light against the muted tones of her living space. As a finance manager, her dominion was the monochromatic ballet of digits. Today, it was the forensic dissection of quarterly earnings, the ruthless hunt for anomalies in sprawling datasets. Her fingers, nimble and precise, danced across the keyboard, coaxing secrets from columns of figures, her brow furrowed in a concentration so absolute it bordered on trance. The low, incessant hum of the machine was the day’s constant companion, broken only by the almost inaudible sigh she might release as a particularly stubborn formula yielded to her will. Her gaze, unwavering, consumed the glowing text, the world beyond the screen—the actual, breathing city—a distant, forgotten tableau. Lunch, an act of pure sustenance, was consumed at the desk, a utilitarian salad or a pre-packaged meal, its plastic tray a sterile island in the sea of her work.



The afternoon bled into the evening with seamless, uneventful progression. Virtual meetings, disembodied voices on a flat screen, offered no true communion. Her contributions were always measured, her tone neutral, her camera steadfastly off. She preferred the disembodied anonymity, a voice without a face, a mind without a body in the echoing void of digital space. The faces of her colleagues, glimpsed briefly in the grid, seemed like inhabitants of a parallel dimension, their triumphs and anxieties mere flickering pixels. As the light outside softened, fading from the sharp clarity of day to the melancholic glow of twilight, a subtle unease would begin to stir. The silence in her apartment, once a comfort, now began to feel less like peace and more like an expansive, encroaching vacuum.



The evening's true ceremony, the ablution, began with the delicate dance of scented candlelight. The tiny flames, wavering like trapped spirits, cast dancing shadows across the pristine white tiles of her bathroom. She would fill the deep porcelain tub, the rush of water a fleeting, thunderous roar in the quiet. Steam, thick and fragrant, rose to caress her face, momentarily obscuring her reflection in the mirror, transforming the harsh lines of reality into a soft-focus dream. Sinking into the scalding embrace of the water, her body exhaled, the day's tensions dissolving into the shimmering heat.



Then, the meticulous ritual of the blade. The razor, a gleaming sliver of surgical steel, was selected with reverence. Lathering her legs, she watched the pristine white foam bloom against her skin, then with a practiced hand, drew the scalpel-keen edge upwards. Each stroke was precise, deliberate, stripping away the invisible down, leaving behind a surface of velvet-smoothness, sensitive to the slightest breath of air. This same meticulousness extended to the most intimate geography of her body. With a quiet breath, she applied the foam to her pubis, the white cloud a stark contrast to the dark lace she had discarded. The razor followed, carving a path through the softest of hairs, leaving no trace, no shadow. It was an act of extreme privacy, a precise self-sculpting for an audience of one, a flawless, hairless expanse maintained with the precision of a votary.



Dripping and flushed, she would emerge from the bath, swathing herself in a large, thirsty towel, before returning to the familiar, comforting disarray of her open robe and the fresh lace of her panties. Dinner, a solitary affair, was consumed in the hushed elegance of her dining nook – perhaps a simple pasta, its sauce a vibrant stain on the white ceramic, or a medley of roasted vegetables. Always, a book lay open beside her plate, a portal to a life beyond her own. She devoured narratives of impossible love, cosmic horrors, or intricate mysteries, vicariously experiencing the passions and terrors denied to her own existence.



Later, the television would flicker to life, its blue light a cold, flickering companion in the deepening gloom. She scrolled through an endless parade of streaming options, never quite settling, never quite engaged. The fabricated dramas, the curated emotions, felt both too distant and too close, a mirror reflecting a life she was not living. Eventually, the quiet, persistent thrum of exhaustion would guide her to her bedroom, the city lights outside her window twinkling like a scattered handful of indifferent diamonds. Sleep was often a shallow thing, her mind occasionally looping back to the day's spreadsheets, or drifting into vague, unformed yearnings that dissipated with the first hint of morning light.



The rap on the door, sudden and insistent, tore through the uncanny quiet of the evening. It was a little past ten, the city a muted, distant hum. Amelia, half-submerged in the plush cushions of her sofa, a well-worn paperback resting open on her bared thigh, froze. Her breath caught, a small, painful gasp in her throat. No one knocked. Not truly.



Then, again, a lighter, more questioning tap. ""Amelia? It's Sarah from 14B. Are you alright? We haven't seen you around much lately."" Sarah. Always Sarah, the building's self-appointed conscience, a woman whose boundless, effervescent sociability was a constant, gentle pressure against Amelia's carefully erected walls.



Amelia’s fingers tightened on the spine of her book, the thin pages crinkling. The robe, as if sensing the intrusion, slipped further open, revealing more of the dark lace. ""Yes, Sarah, I'm perfectly fine!"" she called out, the lie thin and brittle in the sudden stillness, her voice a shade too bright, too quick. ""Just a bit under the weather. Thank you for checking, though!""



She stood there, rigid, listening. A soft sigh, the whisper of fabric, the faint scuff of shoes against the carpet, then silence. Sarah had receded, a tide ebbing from her shores. Amelia released the breath she’d held, a shaky exhalation that tasted of dust and unspoken dread. She remained, suspended, her hand hovering over the doorknob, a barrier unbreached. The loneliness, a cold, familiar weight, settled back into her bones, a heavy cloak in the quiet, stylish, and eternally solitary chamber of her apartment. The door, a simple slab of wood, felt as impenetrable as a vault.





Three weeks passed. three weeks of deepening the grotesque stain emanating from apartment 1413. It commenced as a phantom whisper on the prevailing currents of the building's air conditioning, a scent so faint it was dismissed, waved away as the residue of a forgotten takeaway, a distant plumbing issue, or the spectral breath of urban grime clinging to the ventilation shafts. But as the days accumulated, stitching themselves into a ragged tapestry of time, the whisper grew into a murmur, then a low hum, and finally, a guttural, undeniable presence that seemed to cling to the very air. It was a smell that defied easy categorization, a complex blasphemy against the senses. Not merely the cloying sweetness of decay, nor the sharp tang of something putrefying, nor even the acrid bite of chemicals. It possessed a deeper resonance, a metallic undertone, like blood long dried on forgotten surgical tools, laced with the sickly, sweet perfume of lilies rotting in standing water, and something else, something profoundly animal and profound, hinting at flesh undone, at boundaries breached, at a hidden corruption blooming behind a sealed door.



The residents of the fourteenth floor, accustomed to the easy currents of communal existence – the borrowed cup of sugar, the impromptu hallway chat, the shared lament about the rising cost of utilities – found their social graces curdling. Sarah from 14B, whose initial pleasantry had been so readily rebuffed by Amelia’s disembodied voice, now found her inquiries laced with a mounting dread that tightened her throat. She would tap on the door, her knuckles brushing against the smooth, unyielding wood, and call out, her voice thin with anxiety, ""Amelia? Are you really alright? That smell… it's getting rather strong, dear. Are you sure you don't need anything? I could pick something up for you."" From within, always the same unblemished voice, calm as still water over pebbles, a voice that never seemed to crack or waver, ""I'm fine, Sarah. Just… a little indisposed. Thank you for your concern."" No click of a lock, no reassuring creak of hinges, no comforting crack in the door, no glimpse of Amelia. Just the flat, uninflected reassurance, made monstrous by the evolving stench that coiled from beneath the door, tasting of something utterly wrong.



And it wasn't just the smell. A new, unsettling malaise had begun to infest the floor, a creeping pestilence of the senses. The lights in the hallway, once a steady, reassuring glow, began to flicker erratically, sometimes dimming to a sickly orange pulse, sometimes snapping off entirely, plunging the corridor into an unnerving, transient darkness that felt more like a tangible presence than a mere absence of light. Neighbors would jump, startled, then glance nervously at 1413, as if the very darkness, the very power drain, emanated from within its sealed walls.



Then came the water. Or what appeared to be water. A strange, viscous blackness, thick as crude oil, began to pool sporadically in the indentations of the polished concrete floor. It appeared without warning, seemingly from nowhere, a glistening, opaque stain that defied logic. It had no discernible source; no burst pipes, no overflowing sinks could be traced back to its sudden appearance. It simply was. One morning, Mr. Henderson, the building manager, found a spreading slick outside apartment 1409, a few doors down from Amelia's. He knelt, his finger tentative, and touched the viscous liquid. It was cold, unnaturally so, and left a faint, disturbing oily residue on his skin that wouldn't wash off easily, clinging like a shroud. The building's maintenance staff scoured the pipes, checked every utility closet, but the source remained elusive, a dark, weeping mystery that clung to the floor like a spreading bruise on the building's very soul. The smell and the black water, the flickering lights, became an unholy trinity of dread, slowly tightening their grip on the residents of the fourteenth floor, twisting their anxieties into open fear.



In the small, awkward gatherings by the elevator, the theories began to bloom, wild and desperate. ""It's a burst pipe, I tell you,"" insisted Mr. Goldberg from 1401, trying to project an air of practicality, even as his face paled. ""Must be some kind of toxic mold growing in there. That's why she won't open the door. Afraid of the spores.""



""Mold doesn't smell like that, Arthur,"" countered Mrs. Rodriguez from 1407, clutching her purse tighter. ""That's… that's like something dead. Like a whole animal. Or worse."" Her eyes flickered towards 1413, a morbid fascination warring with outright terror.



David, from 14C, Amelia’s direct neighbor across the hall, had grown noticeably gaunt, the constant presence of the stench eroding his appetite and his peace ""What kind of person changes their locks when they're 'a little indisposed' and their apartment is leaking… that?"" He gestured vaguely at a fresh, inky stain near the communal recycling bins, its edges strangely precise, like a graphic design.



Sarah, her voice tight with suppressed hysteria, wrung her hands. ""But she said she was fine! Every time! So calm. It's not right. And the lights… it's like the whole floor is cursed. My cat won't even go near her door anymore. Just hisses at it.""



""Maybe she's… gone,"" suggested a young woman from 1410, her voice barely a whisper. ""And… whatever she had in there… started to decompose."" This theory, whispered in varying degrees of horror, was the one that truly settled, a cold, heavy stone in their stomachs. But if she was gone, then who was answering? The calm, even voice from behind the door became the central, most chilling mystery. Was it a recording? A trick of the air? Or something else entirely? The black water and the flickering lights seemed to confirm their darkest imaginings, hinting at something beyond the mundane, a slow, invisible transformation within Amelia's sealed world.



The smell, now a monstrous, palpable entity, had permeated the entire building. It clung to clothes, seeped into hair, and tasted metallic on the tongue, a constant, sickening reminder that invaded their private lives. Finally, the collective unease, sharp as a sliver of glass, prompted a formal, desperate call to the building manager, a plea for intervention that carried the weight of their sanity.



Mr. Henderson, a man whose placid demeanor usually only ruffled when rent was late, arrived with his master key, a ring of glinting steel that promised access to every private world within his domain. He tapped on 1413, a brisk, confident rhythm, hoping to project an air of calm authority that he was rapidly losing. ""Ms. Finch? It's Mr. Henderson, the building manager. We've had a few… concerns, some rather unusual reports. Just a quick wellness check, if you please.""



Silence, thick and expectant, descended. Then, that calm, unsettling voice, as unblemished as a fresh-dug grave. ""I assure you, Mr. Henderson, all is well. There is no need for alarm. My… indisposition is simply taking a little longer to pass.""



Henderson frowned, his nostrils flaring involuntarily at the overpowering stench that now seemed to emanate directly from the door, a foul breath from beneath the crack, moist and heavy. He inserted his master key, twisting the brass with a confident snap. It turned freely, without purchase, spinning uselessly in the lock. He tried again, jiggling, rattling, forcing. Nothing. A chill, colder than any air conditioning, snaked up his spine. Amelia Finch had changed the locks. A defiant, solitary act that spoke volumes of her hermetic will, a sudden, brutal severing of her last tangible link to the outside world, a barrier raised against a world she had decided to abandon.



The police arrived swiftly, two uniformed officers, their faces initially etched with the weary patience of routine calls, an almost condescending pity for the hysterical neighbors. They knocked, harder, announcing their presence with official, unyielding authority. ""Police! Open the door, please, Ms. Finch! We have received reports of a strong odor and other… unusual occurrences."" Again, the voice, unchanged, unperturbed by the blare of their presence, an impossible calm. ""There is no need for your presence, officers. I am quite alright. Please leave me to my privacy.""



A frustrated sigh escaped the lead officer, his jaw tightening. They conferred briefly, then the first officer, a burly man whose bulk seemed to absorb the hallway's oppressive atmosphere, raised a heavy boot, aiming for the plate beside the knob. The impact was a dull, shattering boom that echoed down the hallway, rattling the teeth of unseen residents behind their own doors. Yet, the door to 1413 held. Unyielding. A second kick, a third, each one a desperate, failing assault against the silence within. The wood groaned, the frame shuddered, splinters flying, but the door, a golem of wood and steel, remained an impenetrable maw. It was as though the very air behind it had solidified, bracing it against their invasion, infused with an unseen, unholy resolve.



The locksmith, summoned from his quiet domesticity, arrived, his tools clinking in a canvas bag, a mundane counterpoint to the escalating horror. He was a small, meticulous man, accustomed to defiant mechanisms, but even he seemed to shrink in the presence of the burgeoning stench, his eyes watering. He worked slowly, deliberately, the small scraping and clicking sounds of his instruments a grotesque counterpoint to the pervasive, fetid perfume emanating from the door. Minutes stretched into an eternity, each tick of his watch a measure of escalating dread. Sweat beaded on his brow, blurring his vision, the task proving far more obstinate than any he had encountered in recent memory. It was as if the very lock had a will of its own, imbued with a malignant life force, refusing to yield to the prying metal, a desperate resistance to exposure, to the intrusion of the mundane world into whatever horrific sanctity lay beyond. The air, thick with the unholy scent, seemed to grow heavier, pressing in on them.



And then, with a final, protesting groan of tortured metal, a sound like a cry of surrender from something unwillingly broken, the mechanism yielded. A soft, wet click, almost audible over the oppressive silence. The door, which had seemed so impossibly bound, stood unlocked. The lead officer took a deep, fortifying breath, a grim set to his jaw, and placed his hand on the cold doorknob. He turned it, slowly, the dread in the hallway thick enough to taste, a sour, metallic tang on the tongue.



The door swung inward.



The door to apartment 1413 finally yielded, a groan of tortured metal and splintered wood, swinging inward to reveal not a silent, hermetic sanctuary, but a gaping maw. Yet, before the light of the hallway could fully penetrate the abyssal gloom within, before the living could truly cross that threshold into the domain of the corrupted, the narrative of Amelia Finch demanded its final, brutal prelude.

The Final Night



hours passed, before the locksmith’s tools finally cracked the defiant shell of 1413, Amelia Finch had been engaged in the quiet sacrament of her evening meal. Pasta, a simple and unchallenging dish, lay congealed on her plate, a testament to her waning appetite. Her well-worn paperback, a tale of ancient, forgotten horrors, lay open beside her, its pages soft beneath her fingertips. The plush robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a faint shadow against her skin. The only sounds were the distant, anonymous hum of the city, the soft rustle of the turning page, and the occasional clink of her fork against ceramic. Her plain face, usually a mask of mild indifference, was softened by the low glow of the reading lamp, revealing the subtle hollows beneath her cheekbones, the slight puffiness around her inverted nipples that sometimes appeared when she was relaxed. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually a smooth, cool expanse, was subtly flushed from the warmth of the meal and the quiet comfort of her solitary ritual.



Then, the world outside her meticulous routine exploded.



With a sound like thunder, the door to her apartment—that very door now being forced open by the police—burst inward from its frame. Wood splintered, metal shrieked, and a gust of foul, cold air, laden with the stench of something unspeakably wrong, assaulted her. Amelia gasped, her book scattering to the polished floor, a sudden, sharp clatter against the silence. Framed against the shattered entryway stood a figure, stark and terrible: a man cloaked in absolute black, every inch of his form swallowed by dark fabric, his face obliterated by the blank, malevolent void of a black ski mask. In his hand, he held a bludgeon, a heavy, crude club, its surface rough and dark, glinting wetly in the faint light that pierced the doorway.



Terror, a cold, sharp blade, pierced through Amelia's habitual lethargy. It was a sensation so raw, so alien, that it jolted her from her quiet drone, stripping away the layers of monotonous comfort and revealing the trembling animal beneath. Her plain face contorted, a mask of pure, uncomprehending fear, her eyes wide, showing too much white. She screamed, a raw, choked sound torn from a throat unused to such utterance, a sound that grated in the sudden, abyssal silence, and scrambled from the table, overturning her chair in a desperate scramble. The crash of ceramic and wood was swallowed by the sudden, guttural roar of her attacker, a sound of pure, bestial hunger. He moved with a horrifying speed, a dark blur against the fading light of the hallway, a creature of pure, unadulterated intent, a shadow given terrible form. The first blow was aimed at her head, a whistling descent that she barely ducked, the wind of its passage tearing at her hair, a chilling caress of imminent violence. It struck the wall behind her with a sickening thud, leaving a deep gouge, a wound in the very fabric of her home, a testament to the brute force unleashed.



""No!"" she shrieked, her voice thin, useless, utterly inadequate against the encroaching darkness and the relentless, mechanical advance of her assailant. He came at her again, relentless, a predator claiming its due. Her legs, usually so languid, pumped with a sudden, desperate energy she hadn't known she possessed, fueled by a primal need to survive. She fled, tripping over the scattered remnants of her dinner, a desperate, instinctive flight, a flight of pure, unthinking survival. The apartment, once her sanctuary, her ordered, quiet refuge, became a labyrinth of impending doom, each familiar object transformed into a treacherous obstacle. As she stumbled and scrambled, her body a frantic, uncoordinated mess of limbs, the plush robe, already loose and unbelted, snagged on the overturned chair. With a tearing sound, a fabric cry of surrender, it ripped free from her shoulder, falling away in a heap on the polished floor, a discarded skin, leaving her utterly exposed.



Now, she ran in nothing but her lace panties, her body a pale, desperate flash against the deepening shadows of her home. Her natural, perky breasts, freed from the slight restraint of the robe, swung wildly with each panicked stride, two pale, bobbing targets, visibly jiggling and bouncing, pulling at the skin, against the gloom. The inverted nipples, once hidden secrets, were now exposed to the cold, predatory air, shriveling in the sudden, agonizing terror, like eyes retracting from a monstrous vision. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually so smooth and cool, was now slick with a sheen of desperate sweat, prickled with gooseflesh. She scrambled past the crystalline glass desk, her hand tearing at the sparse hair on her head, her fingers clamping, pulling, as if to rip the terror from her skull, past the inert laptop that had once anchored her days, now a silent, impotent observer of her final moments. She ran for the bathroom, the only true refuge, a small, enclosed space of porcelain and tile that promised, foolishly, escape from the nightmare that pursued her.



She slammed the bathroom door shut behind her, fumbling for the lock, her fingers slick with terror, desperately trying to find purchase on the smooth metal, her nails scraping against the cold brass. The wood groaned under the impact of his body, a desperate, shuddering protest, but it held, for a blessed, agonizing moment. She turned, her bare back pressed against the cold tiles, eyes wide, breath ragged, staring at the gleaming white bathtub. It was a porcelain maw, waiting, its clean lines mocking the chaos that had erupted, a pristine basin ready to receive her broken form.



The door splintered inward, ripped from its hinges by the force of his relentless entry, wood tearing with a sound like dying breath. He filled the doorway, a monstrous shadow, his form distorted by the dark fabric, the crude club raised high, silhouetted against the dim light of the hall, a cruel parody of an executioner. Amelia screamed again, a sound that tore from her lungs, pure, unadulterated horror, a final, primal cry of defiance, a desperate animal sound. She stumbled backward, tripping over her own feet, her legs tangling, falling heavily into the tub, the cold porcelain shocking her exposed skin, a chilling premonition of her tomb. Her body slumped, a broken doll, the lace of her panties a stark contrast against the white ceramic.



He was upon her instantly, a dark, heavy weight, a living shadow descending. The club descended. The first blow struck her chest, directly between her breasts, a sickening crack that echoed in the small, enclosed space, stealing her breath. A blinding agony bloomed, fiery and absolute, radiating outwards from her sternum, a burst of searing pain that momentarily eclipsed all other sensation. She choked, a strangled cry escaping her lips, her body convulsing, her breasts, now bruised and mottled, still trembled with the force of the impact, collapsing inward. The second blow landed on her ribcage, a dull, crushing impact that drove the remaining air from her lungs, forcing a ragged wheeze from her lips. She could feel the sharp edges of bone grating, tearing, a hideous symphony of destruction beneath her own skin. A hot, wet gush erupted in her mouth, metallic and coppery. Blood. It overflowed her lips, a crimson testament to the violation, running down her chin and neck.



The club rose and fell again, and again, a terrible, rhythmic punctuation to her dying gasps. Her head lolled, her vision blurring, the blank black ski mask above her swimming in a crimson haze, a swirling vortex of red and black. She felt a searing impact on her skull, then another, a deafening drumbeat of bone against blunt force, each one a final, annihilating declaration, crushing her very thoughts. Her limbs spasmodically, her body becoming a broken puppet, twitching, convulsing, no longer under her command. Blood blossomed like a terrible, dark flower around her, painting the pristine white of the tub in grotesque new hues, a tableau of crimson horror. Her screams were reduced to a gurgling wheeze, then silence, a silence more profound than any she had known. The blows continued, each one a final, annihilating declaration, long after the life had drained from her eyes, leaving her a broken, pulpy mass, forever entangled with the cold, gleaming porcelain. He stood over her, a dark monument to destruction, his silhouette filling the doorway, then turned and vanished back into the night, leaving the broken door, the shattered life, and the emerging, monstrous stillness.

The Awakening



The door swung inward with a faint, final click, revealing the interior of apartment 1413. The three men—the two officers and Mr. Henderson—were immediately assaulted by the full, unfiltered force of the smell. It was no longer a pervasive undercurrent; it was a physical blow, thick and choking, like breathing putrefied velvet. It cloyed at the back of their throats, burned their nostrils, and immediately settled in their stomachs, threatening to revolt. The air inside seemed heavier, stagnant, a tangible weight on their lungs.



The apartment itself was a tableau of interrupted existence, now long past. Dust motes, thick as velvet, danced in the shafts of light that pierced the gloom, illuminated by the officers' flashlights. The minimalist elegance from Amelia’s living photographs had devolved into a grim, unholy disarray. On the glass dining table, two plates sat, one with the fossilized remains of what might have been pasta, now a dark, crusted mass, mottled with grey and green fungi. Beside it, a single, overturned chair lay sprawled, a broken sentinel guarding the decay. A well-worn paperback, its spine cracked, lay open on the polished concrete floor beside it, its pages yellowed and warped, a silent witness to a scene of forgotten terror. Every surface was filmed with a thin, almost oily layer of grime, and the silence, absolute and profound, pressed in on them, far heavier than any sound.



The officers, grim-faced, moved slowly, their flashlights cutting swathes through the oppressive atmosphere. They followed the source of the stench, which intensified with each step, growing from an overpowering reek to a nauseating, undeniable assault. The black, viscous liquid, which had puzzled the building staff in the hallway, was now plainly visible as faint, dried trails on the polished concrete, leading directly towards the bathroom.



The bathroom door hung awkwardly from a single hinge, its wood splintered, a jagged, gaping wound in the otherwise pristine wall. The air in here was a noxious miasma, a concentrated distillation of the foulness from outside. The officer in the lead raised his flashlight, its beam cutting through the oppressive darkness, then he lowered it slowly, revealing the scene within.



The bathtub.



Amelia Finch lay within it, a grotesque parody of repose. Her body, or what remained of it, was a shriveled, blackened husk, reduced by the merciless march of time and decomposition. The once-plush robe was indistinguishable from the matted, dark mass that had once been her hair, clinging to the skeletal remains of her head. The delicate lace panties were gone, consumed by the relentless process. Her large, perky breasts were now flat, shrunken pouches of desiccated flesh, the nipples sunken into a dark, leathery areola, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding decay. The skin, meticulously shaved in life, was now taut and stretched over the sharp angles of bone, a leathery mummy. A dark, dried pool of viscous fluid, almost black, adhered to the bottom of the tub, staining the porcelain a permanent, unholy hue. It was not merely the smell of death, but the profound silence of a body long abandoned, dissolving back into the earth from which it came.



One of the officers gagged, clamping a hand over his mouth. The other, the lead, simply stared, his face ashen beneath the harsh beam of his flashlight. The scene spoke volumes of a terror unheeded, a death unmourned, and a life consumed by the very solitude it had embraced. This was not a fresh corpse; this was a relic of suffering. The police pathologist, called moments later, would confirm their silent horror: Amelia Finch had been dead for at least two months.



And then, the questions began to bloom, sharp and insidious, in the minds of the officers. How? How had the killer entered this sealed tomb? The front door, now hanging by a single hinge, had been secured not only by the changed mortise lock, but by a series of heavy-duty, manual deadbolts and chain locks, all engaged from the inside. The locksmith had struggled mightily, attesting to their formidable security. There was no fire escape, no precarious external staircase leading to the fourteenth floor. The apartment building stood alone, no other structure close enough for a jump or a precarious traverse. And the windows—sleek, modern, and expansive—were immovably sealed, designed for insulation and climate control, offering no egress, no crack to the outside world. The officers exchanged baffled glances, their expressions shifting from grim discovery to profound unease. The killer had vanished without a trace, leaving behind a locked, impenetrable fortress, a perfect, horrifying enigma. It was as if the apartment itself had opened its maw to devour its victim, then sealed itself shut, leaving only the stench as a mocking testament to the horror within. The ordinary laws of ingress and egress seemed to have been utterly, irrevocably violated.



With a shared, unspoken understanding of the impossible, the officers retreated from the apartment's reeking interior. They returned with tools, not for investigation, but for containment. Heavy sheets of plywood were nailed across the broken door frame, crude planks of wood sealing the secrets within. ""Forensics will handle it,"" the lead officer muttered, more to himself than anyone, his voice hollow. ""Until then, nobody goes in. Nobody comes out."" The last nail hammered home, a brutal, final clang, sealing the mysteries of 1413 behind a raw, wooden barrier.



Meanwhile, Amelia Finch sat on her plush, minimalist couch. The reading lamp cast a warm, intimate glow over her. The faded pink robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a soft murmur against her skin. On her lap, a plate of pasta, steaming gently, sat beside a well-worn paperback. She took a slow, deliberate bite, her gaze fixed on the page, the quiet hum of the city a distant, comforting drone. She was alone, in her stylish apartment, utterly absorbed in her book, the silence her only companion. The world outside, its horrors and its mysteries, was a million miles away.",1,1749091963.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

We were on a really good schedule, he would sleep around 7:30-8:00 pm and wake the following morning around 8:00 AM, and sometimes he would even sleep in until 9 AM. 

Now, he falls asleep around 8:30-9:00 PM and fights sleep the entire time. He also fights all of his daytime naps. He usually only has 2 daytime naps that are each around 1.5 to 2 hours. He is taking 15-30 min daytime naps, 1 to 2 times a day. No matter what I do he just becomes hyper as soon as I lay him down to breastfeed and sleep. He doesn't concentrate long enough to nurse effectively, and he jumps and wants to play, but as soon as he's out of the bedroom he wants to sleep again. Could it be the cup of coffee I'm drinking everyday? I recently started drinking Yerba Mate (traditional style, not canned), but only 1-2 times a week. Im not sure if this would be enough to affect his sleep for the past 2 weeks. 

He was recently teething but all 4 teeth have erupted. I also realize he's at an age where he needs more stimulation throughout the day, so we are taking more walks outside and playing a lot. 

Any ideas as to what could have caused this change? He's also started waking up with tons of energy multiple times a night and it takes hours to  get him back to sleep. 

Please any advice or ideas as to what is going on would really be appreciated. Thank you.",1,1749091852.0,cosleeping,0,1.0,False

I had a 3.97 GPA at a target school, President of Finance Club, two previous finance internships that I absolutely grinded for, and I spent literally THREE WEEKS straight doing financial modeling courses ahead of IB recruitment season. My mentors said that I was a shoe-in for at least an upper middle market gig...

My networking was insane as well. I'm not even joking when I say I did exactly 152 coffee chats over 8 months. I tracked everything in a spreadsheet with color coding and follow-up schedules. I used every platform imaginable- LinkedIn Premium, alumni databases, and Recruiter Base which even gave me direct emails for like half the bankers I reached out to. My hit rate was incredible. I had VPs telling me I was ""exactly the type of candidate they were looking for."" I practiced technicals for literally 4 hours every single day. Could walk through a DCF blindfolded, knew every single industry multiple by heart, had responses prepared for 40+ behavioral questions. My friends called me psychotic but I knew it would pay off.

Applications open, interviews start flooding in. Goldman, JPM, Barclays, MS, Citi, DB. I'm thinking this is it, I'm about to be that guy posting his Goldman offer on here making everyone jealous. Fast forward to today and, as mentioned, I'm starting my summer internship at a regional bank in my hometown doing compliance work. Not investment banking. Not even corporate banking. COMPLIANCE. I'm going to be reviewing loan documentation for 10 weeks while other kids from my finance club are in NYC.

What happened? I honestly still don't know. Made it to Super Days at 4 different BBs. Felt like I absolutely crushed every single interview. Had bankers telling me ""we'll be in touch soon"" and I never heard back. The worst part is I can't even figure out what I did wrong. My technicals were flawless, I had genuine connections with my interviewers, my story was polished. I did everything the WSO guides said to do.

Now I'm burnt out, staring at another recruiting cycle next year wondering if it's even worth it. Has anyone else felt completely broken after recruiting? Like you did everything right but still failed? I keep telling myself this compliance internship will teach me about the regulatory side but honestly it's been like a few days and I'm bored out of my mind.

Its ability to integrate seamlessly into your habits — while supporting fat burning, focus, and energy — makes it a standout among natural wellness solutions. Here’s a breakdown of how Java Burn supports your body from the inside out:

**1. Supports Daily Calorie Burning**

One of Java Burn’s core benefits is its impact on your body’s ability to burn energy at rest. With ingredients known to trigger thermogenic activity — like caffeine, green tea components, and plant-based acids — this blend helps increase your baseline calorie use throughout the day.

You don’t need to overhaul your eating plan or commit to strenuous workouts to see results. From your first cup of coffee, Java Burn gets to work by supporting consistent fat metabolism that lasts well beyond breakfast.

**2. Promotes Long-Term Fat Use**

Java Burn does more than stimulate your system — it helps unlock stored energy from body fat. One key ingredient, L-carnitine, plays a transport role, moving fatty acids into the cells where they’re broken down for energy. Meanwhile, other active agents enhance the body’s internal heat production, making it easier to reduce hard-to-burn fat around common storage areas like the waist and hips.

This two-pronged mechanism makes it effective whether you're working out or simply going about your day.

**3. Elevates Energy and Mental Clarity**

Unlike conventional products that rely on heavy stimulants and cause uncomfortable spikes and drops, Java Burn’s formula focuses on steady, clear energy. The presence of naturally calming agents such as L-theanine helps reduce overstimulation while promoting sharper concentration.

Along with the inclusion of essential B vitamins that assist with nerve function and mood regulation, users often report feeling mentally focused and physically energized — all without the post-coffee crash.

**4. Helps Manage Cravings and Hunger**

Struggling with frequent snacking or emotional eating? Java Burn contains ingredients that contribute to more stable blood sugar levels, which can reduce cravings and energy dips between meals. With better control over glucose fluctuations, you may find it easier to make healthier choices and avoid mindless eating.

This makes it a particularly helpful companion for those practicing structured eating patterns like intermittent fasting or managing caloric intake.

**5. Built for Effortless Use**

Perhaps one of the most appreciated aspects of Java Burn is how easily it fits into your lifestyle. There's no need to juggle pills, blend shakes, or remember doses. The formula comes in a flavorless powder form that dissolves instantly into your daily coffee — whether you're at home, at the office, or on the move.

This plug-and-play simplicity has earned Java Burn a strong reputation among busy individuals looking for results without extra complexity.",1,1749091499.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

It plays a critical role in stimulating fat-burning activity by activating brown fat cells, which are known to help generate body heat and utilize calories.

Beyond supporting fat breakdown, EGCG contributes to better metabolic efficiency and may assist with managing blood sugar fluctuations. When consumed with caffeine (as it is in Java Burn), EGCG’s effects are amplified, helping the body tap into energy reserves more effectively.

**2. Chlorogenic Compounds from Green Coffee Extract**

Found in raw coffee beans before roasting, chlorogenic compounds play an important role in influencing how the body processes carbohydrates. They help moderate how quickly glucose enters the bloodstream, encouraging the use of stored fat for energy.

Research indicates that chlorogenic acid may help reduce deep belly fat over time, especially when paired with other metabolism-enhancing ingredients. It also promotes better appetite control and steady energy levels by minimizing post-meal sugar spikes.

**3. L-Carnitine**

L-Carnitine is a naturally occurring compound that plays a vital role in energy production. It acts as a transporter, carrying fatty acids into the mitochondria — where they are broken down and used as fuel.

This mechanism supports physical stamina and mental clarity, particularly during activity or periods of low-calorie intake. For those who struggle with a sluggish metabolic rate, L-Carnitine can help turn stored fat into sustainable energy, making the weight loss process more efficient.

**4. Chromium**

Chromium is a trace mineral with a powerful role in managing insulin function and carbohydrate metabolism. It helps prevent sharp blood sugar swings that often lead to energy crashes or sugar cravings.

For individuals trying to lose weight, chromium can help promote stable energy and improved self-control around food. It also plays a role in preserving lean tissue, which is key to keeping the metabolism running efficiently as fat mass decreases.

**5. L-Theanine**

This calming amino acid, naturally present in tea, helps promote mental balance and focus — especially when consumed with caffeine. It works by smoothing out the overstimulation that can sometimes accompany stimulant-based products.

When combined with the natural caffeine in coffee, L-theanine contributes to heightened focus and mental endurance, without the shakiness or anxiety that can come with other energy boosters. This makes Java Burn a productivity-friendly option for both mind and body.

**6. B6 and B12 Vitamins**

These two essential B vitamins are included for their ability to convert nutrients into energy and support nervous system function. They assist in producing ATP — the body’s main energy molecule — while also helping reduce tiredness and mental fog.

Deficiencies in these nutrients are surprisingly common, especially among people under stress or with inconsistent diets. Including B6 and B12 ensures that the body has the resources it needs to stay energized and focused throughout the day.

At a time when most wellness solutions feel overwhelming or unsustainable, Java Burn offers a refreshing approach. By using trusted, well-studied ingredients to stimulate your body's own systems, it provides a clear, manageable way to support your health goals — all starting with your favorite cup in the morning.

**How Java Burn Helps You Unlock Natural Fat-Burning Potential**

To understand what makes Java Burn stand out, it’s important to look at how your body processes energy. Your metabolic system is responsible for converting nutrients into fuel. However, with age, stress, and modern habits, this system tends to lose its efficiency — resulting in weight retention and sluggishness. That’s where this unique coffee enhancer makes a real impact.

Java Burn is a neutral, dissolvable formula designed to be added to your daily brew. Once mixed with coffee, it initiates a warming response in the body that encourages calorie usage — a biological mechanism that transforms stored fat into energy. When this thermal process is optimized, your body begins to work smarter, not harder, at burning fat, even during rest.

This morning ritual becomes even more powerful when consumed on an empty stomach, as Java Burn’s components are strategically chosen to maximize energy output and accelerate internal fat utilization. Unlike ordinary caffeine, the ingredients in this blend work together to elevate your system’s ability to use fat as a primary fuel source — helping to support long-lasting energy and more efficient metabolism throughout the day.

Java Burn’s formula includes a carefully selected combination of supportive compounds that assist the body’s natural ability to manage weight and enhance endurance. Here’s how each plays its part:

**- Antioxidant-Rich Green Tea Concentrate**  
This extract, derived from green tea leaves, helps stimulate the body's natural calorie-burning process. It activates a special type of fat cell responsible for turning stored fat into usable energy and supports better sugar balance, which is key in preventing new fat accumulation.

**- Plant-Based Chlorogenic Compound**  
Extracted from raw coffee beans, this element plays a role in managing how your body processes sugar and carbohydrates. It encourages the body to use incoming calories for immediate fuel rather than storing them. It also provides a layer of cellular protection, guarding against metabolic wear and tear.

**- L-Carnitine Fuel Transporter**  
This amino acid derivative plays a critical role in delivering fatty acids to the energy centers of your cells. Once there, they are burned for fuel. This makes it easier for the body to tap into existing fat stores, especially during mentally or physically demanding times.

**- Trace Mineral Chromium**  
Known for its role in maintaining sugar stability, this mineral helps balance energy levels and reduces the highs and lows that often lead to sudden cravings. It also helps your body better process carbohydrates, ensuring fewer are converted into fat.

By leveraging these ingredients, Java Burn turns an everyday habit into a strategic wellness boost. Instead of relying on complex diets or intense training routines, this formula supports your body in working more efficiently — all while you enjoy your morning coffee.

It’s not about shortcuts or unrealistic promises. Java Burn offers a consistent, natural way to support your energy and fat metabolism — designed to help you feel better, stay focused, and manage your weight without disrupting your lifestyle.",1,1749091455.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

I don't know why. My mom and aunt kathy quit without having any spending money to buy anything to help. 

I'm getting patches free from 1800quitnow but I want to buy a step counter and different snacks. 

I read on the stopsmoking reddit that buying stuff causes a false set of accomplishment so you don't have any motivation left to actually quit smoking. I think I want to buy instead of do the hard work of quitting. 

So I decided to chill out and just write it out in my journal but I was still feeling like I wanted to buy so I came here to read and make a post. It's late so I'm particularly vulnerable to late night purchases. I'm in that bad demographic that is a tobacco smoker, overweight, and shopping addict. I quit drinking alcohol 20 years ago but I'm a major decaffeinated coffee drinker and that's getting pretty expensive too. I don't like drinking cold stuff so it'd be hard to quit that. I did buy several types of tea last week to have when I quit smoking.

But what if your coffee could offer more than a caffeine jolt? Imagine turning your daily brew into a powerful fat-burning, metabolism-boosting drink that supports long-term weight management — without the hassle of strict diets, pricey supplements, or time-draining workouts.

In a world saturated with weight loss fads, quick fixes, and contradicting health advice, finding a safe and effective solution can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. That’s where **Java Burn** enters the spotlight — a groundbreaking natural coffee additive that transforms your ordinary cup into a metabolism-enhancing powerhouse.

Touted as the first and only 100% natural, flavorless supplement specifically crafted to be mixed with coffee, Java Burn is designed to accelerate fat loss, increase daily energy, and curb appetite — all without the crash commonly associated with conventional stimulants. Just one stick of Java Burn in your morning coffee can help turn your daily habit into a science-supported, fat-burning ritual.

This thermogenic blend works in harmony with coffee’s caffeine content to ignite your body's metabolic furnace. With thousands of users embracing this simple yet strategic weight loss approach, Java Burn is quickly becoming a go-to solution for those seeking sustainable results with minimal lifestyle disruption.

In this in-depth review, we’ll break down how Java Burn works, examine its clinically supported ingredients, highlight real user feedback, and compare it with other popular metabolism-boosting beverages. Whether your goal is fat loss, enhanced energy, or a healthier coffee habit, this guide will help you discover whether Java Burn is the smart addition your wellness routine needs.

**Breaking the Cycle: Why Sustainable Weight Management Feels Out of Reach — And How Java Burn Could Help**

In our hyper-connected, always-on world, the journey to healthy weight management has become more complicated than ever. Despite a flood of weight loss solutions — from trendy diets and calorie tracking apps to gym memberships and miracle supplements — obesity rates are on the rise, and millions are still battling low energy, stalled progress, and mounting frustration.

The reality? Weight struggles often have little to do with motivation or discipline. Instead, they're deeply tied to biological shifts like slowed metabolism, hormonal imbalances, and chronic stress — factors that most mainstream programs fail to address. For many, it’s not that they’re doing things wrong — it’s that their body isn’t responding the way this used to.

As time passes, the body naturally undergoes changes that impact how efficiently it utilizes fuel. What used to be an effortless process of burning off extra calories now slows considerably. You may find that your physique begins to change even if your eating patterns and movement habits remain relatively consistent. The body begins holding on to extra fat, and recovering from physical activity becomes noticeably harder.

Compounding the issue is the modern lifestyle — long hours spent sitting, a heavy reliance on packaged meals, restless nights, and the never-ending pressures of daily responsibilities. These factors disturb the body's internal balance and make it harder to maintain a lean, energized state.

In an attempt to break free from this rut, many reach for quick-energy beverages or stimulant-heavy formulas. While they might provide an initial jolt, they often lead to unease, shaky hands, or exhaustion shortly after. Others go to extremes with overly strict food plans or artificial solutions, only to be met with minimal and short-lived changes.

What’s truly needed is a natural ally that aligns with your body’s built-in rhythms — not another drastic overhaul. That’s where **Java Burn** makes its mark. Instead of forcing radical lifestyle changes, it quietly complements your current habits — particularly your morning brew.",1,1749091377.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

I was at a Pride event in my state this week, I had the troops up by 7am to drive down for our whole day. I got a hotel, had our coffee ready to go, the whole shebang 

The day went perfectly 
Started the party early, was drinking all around a beach and got a lot of love from others on my fit~ 

I have never had a night a club where I’ve ended up making out with a stranger but alas, we’ve done it 

It was after midnight, dancing in this awesome gay club when this attractive, semi older fellow(mid 40’s? For context I am 26) came into the mix and sure as shit I guess it started happening

I wish I could remember more of it bc it comes in and out of memory , right up until the lights came on lmao. But I remember being touched how I wanted and definitely gave him a show haha 

I’ll never see that man again but thanks for making me feel like the hot gay man I’ve always known I could be x 


Ps There was a fine ass man on this rooftop bar that was interested in me and I totally blew it bc I was a little lit and so focused on getting back to my friends that I just answered his question and left lmao

The world is changing\. Not just in how we live\, but how we earn\. No longer are desks and cubicles the default\. The digital nomad economy has exploded—people are working from Bali beaches\, Lisbon rooftops\, and Tokyo subways\. This isn’t a trend\. It’s a revolution\.

Gone are the days when your job was tied to geography\. Now\, your skills\, hustle\, and ambition define your worth\. But what exactly do these location\-independent warriors do for money\? Let’s break it down\.

_🚀 Discover What You’re Missing Out On\!
Start diagnosing your digital nomad income potential now\: [https\:\/\/nomadincomedetector\.gleam\.ink\/](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_

### Freelance Writing and Content Creation

Words are power\. In the digital age\, they’re also currency\. From blog posts to brand copy\, freelance writers craft the narratives that drive engagement and conversions\. Whether you specialize in SEO\, storytelling\, or technical writing\, there’s a market for your voice\. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are packed with clients willing to pay for quality content\. The key is to build a portfolio that screams professionalism—and charge accordingly\.

But this isn’t about churning out generic fluff\. It’s about delivering value\. Clients want clarity\, creativity\, and consistency\. If you can master those three C’s\, you’ll never have to worry about the next paycheck\.

### Web Development and Tech Consulting

In a world driven by code\, web developers are the architects of opportunity\. They build e\-commerce sites\, landing pages\, and custom applications that help businesses scale\. For digital nomads\, this means access to high\-paying gigs from anywhere with an internet connection\.

Tech consulting takes it a step further\. Instead of just building websites\, you advise companies on how to optimize their online presence\. You become a problem solver\, a strategic thinker\, and a trusted advisor\. The best part\? Your skills are in demand across every industry—from healthcare to fintech\.

This is not for the faint of heart\. You need to stay ahead of the curve\, constantly learning new frameworks and technologies\. But for those who thrive in fast\-paced environments\, the rewards are immense\.

### Digital Marketing Mastery

Marketing is the art of persuasion\. In the digital realm\, it’s also a science\. Digital marketers use data\, algorithms\, and psychology to drive traffic\, boost sales\, and grow brands\. For nomads\, this is a goldmine\. You don’t need a team or an office—you just need a laptop and a brain full of strategies\.

From social media campaigns to email marketing funnels\, the possibilities are endless\. You could be managing ad accounts in Singapore while sipping coffee in Chiang Mai\. The beauty of this field is its scalability\. One campaign can reach millions\. One strategy can change everything\.

But here’s the catch\: you have to be relentless\. You have to test\, analyze\, and adapt faster than your competition\. And you have to deliver results\. That’s the only language that matters in this game\.

### Graphic Design and Visual Storytelling

Visuals speak louder than words\. A single image can convey emotion\, tell a story\, or sell a product\. Graphic designers are the silent influencers of the digital world\. They create logos\, banners\, infographics\, and more\. And they get paid handsomely for it\.

For nomads\, graphic design is a dream profession\. You can work from anywhere\, set your own hours\, and choose your clients\. The challenge is standing out in a crowded market\. You need a unique style\, a strong portfolio\, and the ability to understand your client’s vision\.

But if you can master the balance between art and commerce\, you’ll find yourself in high demand\. Brands are always looking for fresh perspectives\. And in a hyper\-connected world\, that’s your greatest asset\.

### Teaching and Online Education

Knowledge is power—but it’s also profitable\. Online educators are reshaping the way people learn\. Whether you teach English\, coding\, or entrepreneurship\, you can reach students across the globe\. Platforms like Teachable and Udemy make it easy to launch courses and monetize your expertise\.

What sets successful online teachers apart\? Passion\, structure\, and real\-world experience\. Students don’t want theory—they want practical insights that they can apply immediately\. If you can deliver that\, you’ll build a loyal following and a sustainable income stream\.

And let’s not forget private tutoring\. Many digital nomads offer one\-on\-one lessons in languages\, math\, or music\. It’s flexible\, lucrative\, and deeply rewarding\. Plus\, you get to watch your students grow while you travel the world\.

### E\-commerce and Dropshipping

Entrepreneurship meets mobility in the world of e\-commerce\. Dropshipping allows you to run a business without holding inventory\. You partner with suppliers who handle the logistics while you focus on branding\, marketing\, and customer service\.

This model is ideal for nomads because it requires minimal overhead and maximum agility\. You can start small\, test different niches\, and scale as you go\. The key is finding a product that solves a problem and resonates with your audience\.

But dropshipping isn’t a get\-rich\-quick scheme\. It demands discipline\, patience\, and persistence\. You’ll face challenges—supply chain issues\, customer complaints\, and algorithm updates\. But if you’re willing to put in the work\, the payoff is huge\.

### Affiliate Marketing and Passive Income Streams

Passive income is the holy grail of financial freedom\. Affiliate marketing is one of the most accessible ways to build it\. You promote products or services and earn a commission for every sale\. The best part\? You don’t have to create anything from scratch\. You leverage existing offerings and funnel traffic to them\.

The secret to success lies in niche selection and audience trust\. Choose a product you believe in\, and build a community around it\. Whether it’s through blogs\, YouTube\, or Instagram\, your goal is to provide value and drive action\.

Once you’ve established a system\, the income compounds\. More traffic means more commissions\. More followers mean more influence\. And more influence means more opportunities\.

### App Development and Software Engineering

Apps are the new frontier\. Every day\, millions of people download mobile applications for productivity\, entertainment\, and communication\. For digital nomads\, app development is a gateway to innovation and wealth\.

Software engineers build the backbone of this ecosystem\. They write code\, debug systems\, and deploy solutions that power the digital world\. With the right skills\, you can land remote jobs at top\-tier companies or start your own venture\.

But this isn’t for everyone\. You need to be technically proficient\, detail\-oriented\, and constantly learning\. The tech landscape evolves rapidly\, and staying relevant is essential\. However\, for those who thrive in this environment\, the rewards are limitless\.

### Copywriting and Brand Messaging

Words still matter\. In fact\, they’ve never been more important\. Copywriters craft the messages that sell products\, services\, and ideas\. They know how to tap into emotions\, create urgency\, and drive action\.

For digital nomads\, copywriting is a powerful skill\. You can work with startups\, SaaS companies\, or e\-commerce brands from anywhere in the world\. The key is to understand your audience and speak directly to their needs\.

Great copy doesn’t just inform—it transforms\. It turns readers into customers\, skeptics into believers\, and casual browsers into loyal fans\. If you can master this art\, you’ll never struggle to find work again\.

### Photography and Videography as a Nomadic Profession

Images capture moments\. They tell stories\. They sell dreams\. For digital nomads\, photography and videography are both a passion and a profession\. Whether you shoot stock photos\, create travel vlogs\, or produce branded content\, your visuals can generate income\.

The challenge is standing out in a saturated market\. You need a distinct style\, a compelling portfolio\, and a deep understanding of your audience\. But if you can deliver consistent\, high\-quality work\, you’ll attract clients who are willing to pay top dollar\.

Plus\, the beauty of this field is its versatility\. You can work as a freelancer\, start a YouTube channel\, or even launch your own brand\. The sky’s the limit—if you’re willing to take the shot\.

For digital nomads\, this is a lucrative career path\. You can work with small businesses\, startups\, or even celebrities from anywhere in the world\. The key is to build relationships and deliver measurable results\.

Influencer collaborations take it a step further\. You partner with creators to amplify brand messages and drive engagement\. It’s a win\-win\: brands get exposure\, and influencers earn money\. If you can navigate the nuances of this space\, you’ll unlock a world of opportunities\.

You can translate documents\, websites\, or software interfaces\. Or you can localize content to fit cultural nuances\. Either way\, your skills are in demand across industries—from finance to fashion\.

The key to success is fluency—not just in language\, but in context\. You need to understand the tone\, intent\, and audience behind every message\. If you can do that\, you’ll command premium rates and build a loyal client base\.

People want to improve their lives\. Online coaches help them do it\. Whether you coach entrepreneurs\, athletes\, or creatives\, your role is to guide others toward their goals\. For digital nomads\, this is a deeply fulfilling and financially rewarding career\.

If you have expertise in a specific area—business\, fitness\, mindset—you can monetize it\. Build a course\, host a group coaching program\, or offer one\-on\-one sessions\. The sky’s the limit\.

The best VAs become indispensable\. They streamline operations\, reduce stress\, and increase productivity\. If you can deliver exceptional service\, you’ll attract clients who are willing to pay top dollar\.

### Crypto Trading and Blockchain Consulting

$1300 just on coffee, over $6000 on Amazon of which easily 80% was shit I didn't actually need, probably $1000 on takeout because I was too lazy to cook, guesstimating about \~$1500 overspent at the grocery on fancy crackers and artisan pickles that I didn't need, and about $200 in useless subscriptions. There's some more that I'm too embarrassed to bring up but in all in all I wasted easily 15k on things that gave me no more than a few hours of joy at best when I hit the buy button. The extra kick in the dick was I thought I was actually being kind of reasonable with my spending, I rarely go out into the city and just kinda buy little things here and there (in my mind). 

Obviously my spending habits are nothing compared to some people and none of this is really revelatory, but this sneaks up on you incredibly fast. $15k could've been several amazing vacations but no, I spent it on PLVOELXIN Men's Christmas Boxers Best Warm Comfortable Gift Idea and dunkin's instead.

Like the radio blaring through heavy traffic, its static crackling in the claustrophobic silence. I won’t have to listen to my dad’s complaints about it anymore. Outside the window, the cars inch forward in a sluggish crawl, the city’s skyline fading behind us. My mom sits beside me, her voice almost a whisper as she hums along, forcing herself to sing—probably to drown out the memories of my dad’s constant silence. Tommy, my little brother, is in the back, fingers flying over the screen playing Roblox, oblivious to the weight of everything. He’s just about to turn nine, still trying to grasp why Mom and Dad aren’t together anymore. I don’t want to spoil his innocence with my own worries. As we edge closer to the outskirts of town, I notice Mom’s nose scrunching and her hands tightening on the wheel, her knuckles white. This move—this new start—it's a hard road for anyone, especially her.

“Where’s your charger?” Tommy asked.

“It’s in one of the boxes in the trunk, I think,” I replied. You would’ve thought I just hurt a dog in front of Tommy the way he reacted.  

“Why are we moving so far from Dad?! Is he coming with us later?” Tommy screamed.  

“No honey, your dad and I love you very much, but we’re having a difficult time right now,” my mom tried to comfort Tommy.  

As Tommy was sniffing his tears away, I reached in my pocket and gave him a Chief Wahoo pin. My dad loves Cleveland baseball, and he would always take Tommy to the games. I wish just once he would take me. Giving Tommy that pin reminded him of Dad and brought him just enough comfort to pull himself together.  

We’ve been driving for thirty minutes and haven’t seen a single restaurant or grocery store—just a Dollar General and deer crossing signs. That’s what most of Ohio consisted of outside of the city.  

Finally, we pull into our new home, surrounded by woods. It’s nothing fancy, just a humble three-bedroom, two-story house. We stretch as we get out of the car and just stand, staring, in silence.  

Mom broke the silence by saying, “C'mon boys! Let's see your new rooms!”  

It was nice to think that I was finally going to have my own room. Tommy and I had to share a room, and most of the time share a bed. Not because we only had one bed, but because sometimes we heard Mom and Dad fighting, and Tommy would be scared and slip into my bed while I was sleeping.  

Breaking free of the trance, I shake my head and grab my bag from the car. I pat Tommy on the back, and we make our way up the old wooden porch. From what I was guessing, I would say this house was built in the 60s—based on the house’s chipping paint, creaky wooden porch, and vintage window curtains. But again, I’m excited for this new chapter. Well, not really excited, but intrigued.  

When Mom finally pushed open the front door, I braced myself for chaos—broken furniture, trash strewn across the floor, signs of a hurried abandonment. Instead, I was met with an unnerving stillness. The house felt frozen in time, as if the owners had simply disappeared, leaving everything exactly as it was—furniture draped in ghostly layers of dust, curtains hanging limp and yellowed, swaying faintly as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. The stale air clung to my skin, thick with the scent of neglect and forgotten memories. Every step I took echoed unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence, like the house was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I help Tommy with his bags as he runs upstairs to see his new room. I throw mine over my shoulder and head up the stairs. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* I freeze. These steps—they don’t even creek when I step on them. They… well, I’ve never heard steps that make that noise.  

“Mom!” I shout. “Watch what happens when I walk on these steps.”  

*Pop-ching!* As I put my weight on the first step.  

“Huh, that’s unique!” My mom then turns away to continue unpacking boxes. I have a feeling that bothers her too, but she’s trying to stay positive. So I don’t say anything either—I’ll just have to put up with the odd noise. I’ll have to figure out another way to sneak out at night.  

I reach the top of the stairs to see one single hallway where all three bedroom doors meet. I enter the first one to see Tommy looking out the window.  

“Hey buddy, wanna help me unpack your games?” I ask him.  

But he’s just staring out the window.  

“Tommy?” I ask again.  

“Oh, sorry, I was looking at that old barn out there,” he replied.

“The old barn?” I look outside to see a leaning wooden barn, about half the size of the house. “Maybe we can check it out after we unpack.” I say, trying to get Tommy to help me.  

Like a conductor on stage, Tommy told me where and how exactly he wanted his toys—how to face them and what position they should be in.  

“My pin!” Tommy yelled as he frantically checked his pockets.  

“Don’t worry, we’ll find it. You just had it; it can’t be far,” I reassured him.  

After scouring his room, I figured it was in the car, when I gave it to him. I walk down the *unique* stairs and go outside. I open the rear passenger door and see it on the floor.  

As I close the door, Tommy yells from my bedroom window, “Was it there?!”  

“Go Indians!” I jokingly say as I lift up the pin.  

Suddenly, a faint voice sliced through the silence—distorted, broken, like a record scratched beyond repair. It was close enough to make my skin crawl, yet distant enough to be dismissed as a neighbor. But I knew better. The voice was warped, fragments of words drifting in and out, echoing with unnatural echo. My mind spun, trying to find sense in the fractured sounds. ‘Did we even have neighbors?’ I wondered, trembling. ‘Or is something else here—something that shouldn’t be?’ The voice’s strange, broken cadence sent icy shivers down my spine, each word a jagged shard of a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.   

“You moved my bed wrong.” Tommy instructed me from my bedroom, which broke me out of my deep thoughts.

“Get out of my room.” I plainly say as I walk inside.  

Nothing was in my room; I was just tired of getting bossed around by an almost nine-year-old.



The first night passed, and now the house had a mix of the old furniture from the previous owner and the items we brought. Mom is very happy that she doesn’t have to buy new couches or lamps, since I know she can’t afford them.  

I decided to crash on the old couch, as I didn’t get a full night’s rest. I woke up last night with Tommy asking if he could sleep with me. The old springs groaned loudly beneath me as I plummeted onto the sagging couch, its rusted coils protesting with a squeal.

We really didn’t bring much furniture—since we didn’t have any—but one thing we did bring was the TV. I turned on *The Sopranos*, and before I knew it, I was extremely tired.  

I woke up to see Cleveland Baseball on the TV, but Tommy was nowhere to be found. Annoyed, I get up and look for Tommy. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* as I run up the stairs.  

“If you’re going to change the channel, at least be there to watch it!” I yell as I turn the corner into Tommy’s room. But he’s not there.  

I walk up to his window and look out into the backyard, where I see him just as he enters the barn. Curious about what Tommy was doing, I head downstairs so I can follow him. I exit the front door and slowly start to make my way to the backyard. At this point, I realize that I never took in the surroundings outside of the house. I glance at the peeling siding and chipped paint, but I don't look at it with disgust. I'm almost in awe that the outside of the house is basically falling apart, yet we find the inside untouched.

*BAM!* “What the—?” As I was looking at the house, I seemed to run into an old dog house. Just like the outside of our home, the dog house has seen better days. It has white siding and a red-painted roof, which is chipping. Right above the entrance, I see a painted-on bone with a name written on it. “Samson,” I mumble under my breath. No sign of any dog here.

I pick up my pace and jog to the barn. I stop before walking through the open doors of the barn to appreciate how it's still standing, even though it has an impressive lean. “Tommy?” I nervously ask. With no response, I enter the barn. The rusty tools clink softly as I brush past them, their jagged edges catching what little light filtered in. The air inside the barn was thick with the scent of mold, old hay, and decay. I could feel the rough, cold wood of the beams beneath my fingertips and hear the distant drip of water echoing through the stale silence. Straw covers the ground, and there are soggy bales of hay that look like they were placed 40 years ago. A drip of water falls on the bridge of my nose, startling me. I look up to see more sky than roof.

""Tommy, seriously, come on."" My voice edged with impatience as I scanned the barn. Two horse stalls sit against the weathered wood, the first one creaking softly. I hear a faint rustling from inside. ""Dude,"" I say, more sharply now, stepping closer. The gate is closed, but the wood has been rotted thin, gaps opening like broken teeth. I lean in, squinting. There—an eye glints back at me through the cracks. My stomach tightens. I jump back, slipping on the damp hay sprawled across the ground, and stumble onto the dirt.

I hear a burst of laughter, It’s Tommy, pushing open the gate with a grin. I glare at him, trying to catch my breath.

""Yeah, real funny,"" I mutter, “What are you doing here?” 

“You told me to come in here! I heard you call me out here, but I couldn't find you, so I thought we were playing a game. Remember when you said we could explore the barn after we put my things away?”

“Uh, yeah, I guess I did say that,” I replied. I rub my eyes and head, feeling a mix of confusion and the aftereffects of the fall.

“C'mon, let's go inside,” I say as I rub his back.

“Wanna watch baseball with me, Jonathan?!” Tommy asked me eagerly.

“Sure, buddy.” I replied.



The room was cloaked in darkness, the only sound was my steady breathing and the TV commercials. Despite the silence, a strange comfort washed over me—this rare quiet, broken only by distant creaks and the whisper of the wind outside, made me feel like I was finally alone in this haunted place. It's only the second week of being here—in our new house, in our new life. Not surprisingly, baseball is on the TV. It's not even a live game; it's a rerun. Just having the game on in the background reminds Tommy of Dad. Tommy never saw the side of Dad I saw. He only saw the side that took him to games and bought him a hotdog.

I sit in the old recliner in the living room, next to the couch. I look into the kitchen and see the back door, and notice something odd about it. The back door was a fortress—no window to see outside, just three heavy locks securing it. The thick, dark wood seemed to absorb the moonlight, leaving the house feeling more like a prison than a home. I wondered who had built it like this—what secrets did those locks hide? Now that I notice that, I realize there are no windows on the ground floor. But who knows what they were thinking when they built this house in the '60s. Maybe it had something to do with the Cold War.

I relax as I watch the rerun alone. Mom was asleep after a long day of work, and Tommy was in his room doing who knows what. What I was most excited about in our new lives was the quiet. You’d be surprised how stressful it was, living all together—listening to Dad try to sneak out with his latest woman, slipping through the kitchen like a thief, while Mom yelled at him from the front door. Sometimes, it was a guy. Over time, you stop reacting. You go numb. Mom fell into that same trap. But thankfully, my aunt helped her break free.

I jolt upright from the chair, gasping, sweat sticking to my skin. I must’ve dozed off. The TV flickers with an old shopping commercial; I switch it off and stand. As I turn toward the stairs, I catch it—a muffled voice, faint but strange: “Watchhhhhh… baseball?” My heart skips. I freeze. That’s Tommy outside, right? But it doesn’t sound like him. It’s like he’s learning to talk again—mumbling, uncertain, almost like a toddler. I rub my eyes, trying to shake the fog. But I can’t go check the window—there are no windows here.

I wait and wait, but nothing happens. “Maybe Tommy was sleep talking? Or it was still part of my dream,” I ask myself in my head. I finally decide to head up to my room, so I turn around and go up the stairs. Damn, I totally forgot that we have *unique* stairs. I'll have to try my best to be as quiet and light as possible when I take these steps. I carefully place my foot on the first step. *Pop-ching!* The sound rings out sharply in the silence. My stomach tightens. I freeze, holding my breath. The noise echoes unnaturally loud. I quickly shift my weight against the wall, trying to muffle the sound, but the *Pop-ching!* repeats, each step feeling heavier with dread.

“Hello? What’s going on?” Mom’s voice is groggy, fogged with exhaustion.

I hang my head, feeling defeated. “Sorry, Mom—I fell asleep downstairs. Just... tired.” I hate robbing her of the little sleep she gets lately.

She offers a faint, tired smile. “It’s okay, honey. I’ll see you in the morning.”  

I force a faint smile and hurriedly climb the creaky stairs. *Pop-ching! Pop-ching!* Each step sounds like a scream in the silent house. I grit my teeth. “Why do these stupid stairs sing every time I step on them?” I mutter, my voice edged with irritation.  I stumble into my room and collapse onto the bed. The only light filters in through the window—an icy blue glow from the moon. My body aches from exhaustion, but a faint shiver still runs down my spine from that dream—Tommy’s voice echoing strange and distorted. I sit up stiffly, pulling the curtains closed, shutting out the darkness and trying to shake off the unease.



It’s been a month since we moved, and today marks the day Tommy’s been counting down to since we arrived. The day Dad finally takes him to a Cleveland Indians game. From the moment the sun rose, Tommy’s been bursting with energy—wearing his Indians jersey and cap, talking nonstop about the game like it’s the biggest event of his life. Meanwhile, I feel a quiet knot in my stomach—this is the day Mom’s least looked forward to: seeing her ex-husband again.

I don’t feel much about Dad—no anger, no warmth. It’s like he’s a stranger I pass in the hall. And I’m pretty sure he feels the same. But if Tommy’s smile can be because of him, then maybe that’s enough. I slip into the kitchen, peeking around the corner just enough to hear Mom talking softly on the phone. Her voice is calm, but I catch certain words—her mentioning a date with her ex. I stop, pressing my back against the wall, trying not to make a sound. It’s almost shocking—only a month out of love, and she’s already talking about dating again? Or maybe she’d fallen out of love long before she left him. The thought stings, sharper than I expected.

I step outside with Tommy, tossing the ball back and forth beneath the fading late-afternoon sky. The yard is quiet, save for the occasional laugh or thud of the ball. About fifteen minutes in, a strange voice cuts through the stillness: “Samson? Where areee...?” The words are drawn out, distorted, like they’re coming from far away, then abruptly cut off with a scratchy, static-like noise. 

As I turn to face where the voice came from, the ball hits me in the back of the neck, startling me and breaking the moment. 

“Sorry, Johnathan!” Tommy yells, his face pale with worry.  

I rub the spot where the ball hit, grimacing. “No, it’s okay,” I say, trying to keep my voice steady. “I thought we didn’t have neighbors around here.” 

Tommy tilts his head, eyes wide. “Maybe they’re looking for their dog?” he suggests softly, voice tentative.  

I glance in the direction where the old, weathered dog house sits in shadow. “There’s an old dog house back there,” I murmur, more to myself than him. A chill runs down my spine.  

Tommy hesitates, then asks quietly, “Should we go check?”

“No, let’s go inside,” I say quickly. I lock the door behind us, the click echoing in the quiet house. The air feels heavier now, shadows stretching across the walls. I flick on the TV, tuning into the game, trying to drown out the strange feeling crawling up my spine. Tommy plops onto the couch, eyes fixed on the screen, while I listen to Mom upstairs—still on the phone, her muffled voice drifting down.

I lean closer, catching snippets of her muffled voice upstairs. “I know! Maybe Pink?” she whispers, her tone tentative.  

“Well, you know...” she trails off, voice lowering to a whisper I can barely hear.  

“We did have that thing—what, nine years ago?” The words hang in the air, strange and out of place. My stomach tightens. What are they talking about?  

My heart leaps as Tommy suddenly appears beside me, eyes wide. “What’s nine years ago?” he asks innocently, but there’s a hint of curiosity I don’t like.  

I startle, turning sharply. “What are you doing? I thought you were watching the game,” I say, voice tight. Without thinking, I gently but firmly push him onto the couch, trying to mask my rising unease.

I hear the gravel beneath the driveway crunch loudly as a figure appears. Tommy’s eyes widened with anticipation. Without hesitation, he bolts outside, sprinting toward the battered Chevy parked at the edge of the yard.  

“Dad!” Tommy shouts, voice full of excitement.

Dad steps out of the car, a wide grin spreading across his face. “Tommy, my man! How’s my little buddy?” he calls, opening his arms.  

Tommy charges forward, launching himself into a hug. Dad ruffles his hair affectionately, a fleeting smile touching his lips—though I notice a flicker of something guarded in his eyes.

Dad approaches cautiously, voice hesitant. “Hey, Johnathan. How’s the new house treating you?”  

I shrug, trying to keep my tone neutral. “Fine.”  

He glances toward the house, then asks softly, “Where’s your mom?”  

“Upstairs,” I reply. He hesitates, then just settles onto the porch steps, watching the house but not going inside.

Suddenly, Dad raises his voice, calling out, “Heather! Heather! Come here!” His tone is casual but urgent, almost like he’s calling a lost dog.  

From upstairs, I hear Mom’s voice, soft but wary. “John, what is it?” she calls, peeking around the doorframe.  

Dad gestures impatiently. “Come here! Let me see you,” he insists, voice firm but strained.

“Bring him back before dark, please. We don’t have any street lamps down here,” Mom says sharply, turning away and heading upstairs.  

Dad mutters, “What a dump,” under his breath, then grabs Tommy by the shoulders. They climb into the battered sedan, and as they drive away, I catch Tommy waving at me through the window, a bright smile on his face. I raise my hand in return, forcing a smile of my own. But as soon as the car disappears down the road, that smile slips away, replaced by a heavy silence inside me.

Inside, I find Mom at the dining table, sweeping crumbs into a dustpan. I hesitate, then speak. “Mom, we heard that voice outside. It was weird—kind of scratchy, like it was far away but close at the same time.”  

She looks up, brushing her hair back. “Maybe it was just some hikers passing by. Could you put this box of your school papers downstairs?” she asks, her tone trying to sound casual but distracted.

As I descend into the basement, an eerie silence replaces the usual creaks and groans of the old stairs. These steps are older, more fragile, and strangely quiet—almost unnerving. I set the box down in a convenient corner, then turn back.  

Jackpot. An old cardboard box with “Memorabilia” written in Sharpie across the top. I sift through it, finding faded photographs and a few worn diaries. I pull out one, flipping through the pages—nothing exciting, just scribbles and memories. Since I left my PS4 at Dad’s, this will have to do for passing the time.

I climb back up the creaking stairs, glancing at the quiet, aged steps. Something about them bugs me—their silence, the way they seem so different from the loud, protesting steps I remember. I decide to figure out why the stairs going upstairs are so loud. I toss the diary onto the rickety coffee table, then head toward the small closet beneath the stairs. No light inside—just darkness. I fumble for my flashlight, flick it on, and the beam cuts through the gloom. My breath catches as I see what’s inside.

I kneel beneath the staircase, heart pounding. Tiny, almost invisible mechanisms are embedded just beneath each step—an intricate web of thin wires snaking across the wood. They’re connected to a small, rusted bell mounted on the wall, its surface mottled with age. My fingers tremble as I trace the delicate wires, realizing someone went to great lengths to set this trap. The faint metallic ping of the bell echoes softly in the silence, like a warning whisper.  

It’s no accident that these stairs don’t creak—every wire, every trigger, is carefully wired, a sinister alarm system designed to alert someone—or something—when I move. A cold shiver runs down my spine. Why? To wake the house when I sleep downstairs? To keep watch over me? My mind spirals with questions, each more unsettling than the last.

I rise slowly, my mind racing with everything I’ve just uncovered. I head upstairs, intending to tell Mom, but her muffled voice drifts down—she’s on the phone again, talking with her friend. I hesitate, listening for a moment, then decide to wait until she’s finished.  

Reluctantly, I go back downstairs, the house eerily quiet. I grab the old diary from the corner, settle onto the couch, and try to steady my nerves.",1,1749090962.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

> Rule 1: If someone watches you for more than three seconds without blinking, take note of their outfit. You may need to identify it in the dark.



Hey.

It's not easy to start this without feeling my throat close up. Without hearing the sound of his breathing behind me — even though I know there's no one here. Today, I write to warn. Because what happened to me and Manel... it's not just about fear. It's about meat. It's about what can be ripped away from you when you ignore the signs.

It all started with a look. A damn look in an almost empty parking lot. He didn't say anything. Just… looked. He looked like someone who wants to find out how many vertebrae you have before deciding which one will break first.

> Rule 2: If you feel like you are being followed, you are. Don't wait for confirmation.



Manel started to understand. I came home from work looking back. Sometimes I thought it was paranoia. Until it wasn't anymore.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. Irregular, almost childish handwriting. No subscription. Just one sentence that burned:

> ""You're even more beautiful in person than in the photo. I like to see you come back.""



We returned to my family's house. We thought it was the end. But that... that was just the beginning of the dismemberment of our peace.

> Rule 3: If you receive a letter without a return address, burn it. But never burn it without taking a photo first. You may need to remember what the paper smells like.



The second letter came after the first photo.

Manel vomited when she saw it. It was sweaty, blurry, but it was her — in front of our building, holding the grocery bag. A moment she didn't even remember. But he remembered. He archived.

> Rule 4: Never underestimate someone who collects your moments. He doesn't see a body. View a property.



I started watching. Late at night, coffee in hand, knife at waist. And that Wednesday... I saw his outline.

Behind the fence. Stopped.

I opened the door.

He smiled. It didn't run. He just turned and walked slowly. As if he were guiding me.

> Rule 5: Never follow. Never follow something that wants to be followed. You will get where he wants you.



But I followed.

I ran to him. I reached it. I pushed against the asphalt. The sound of the impact was dry, and the smell... his smell was rotten, like a dead pig on the side of the road.

The police took it. They found the photos. Several. Some from Manel. Others… from women we don't recognize. One, in particular, had her eyes crossed out and her mouth cut out with a red pen.

But then… silence.

No judgement. No sentence. No name.

> Rule 6: If the police say they “will take care of it”, ask the detainee’s name. If they refuse, start digging. You may need a hiding place before the week is over.



We change. New CEP. New chip. New name on the intercom. But the world has a strange way of spitting back what it has swallowed.

A few days ago, I found a new letter. No seal. No signature. Placed inside the bathroom window — on the inside.

> ""I loved the new haircut. It would go with formaldehyde.""



> Rule 7: If a message appears inside the house, even with locked doors: change it. Don't even think. Don't even hesitate. Leave as you are, even if it's naked and bleeding.



Manel hasn't spoken since. She sits in the corner, looking at the wall. He scratches the same word with his nails, again and again: “return”.

I? I don't sleep. I just write, watch, and prepare.

Because the man who took our peace of mind...

> Rule 8: If he takes your peace, he doesn't just want that. He wants the sound of your bones breaking in the dark. And he will wait for the right moment to hear it.



And if you, reader, got this far — memorize these rules. Spread it out. Because he might be reading this over your shoulder right now.

And if he is...

> Last rule: Never look back slowly. If you have to look, let it be to hit the stake in the neck.

1l3o0qc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3o0qc,Neat Cakes Dominion Road,"Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been venturing around Mount Eden on foot trying out different cafes.

My periambulations (and Instagram) took me to Neat Cakes just down from the op shops at the city end of Dominion Road.

Neat Cakes does plant based baked goods (specialising in cake) and I, a dairy fiend, was intrigued to see how well a vegan icing hit the icing spot.

Over my travels I have returned to Neat Cakes multiple times and have now tried a fairly decent chunk of their offerings and feel qualified now to say I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to people looking for cakes and other baked goods - even if not vegan. I have also found that they last a good number of days in both the fridge and the pantry which came in handy with some of the richer flavours. 

Here’s some of the food I’ve tried:

The Bruce Tub:
This is supposed to be a version of the bruce cake in the Matilda movie. This is layers of chocolate cake and Whittakers chocolate ganache. This was tasty but (unsurprisingly) very rich. It took me a couple of days to finish because after the first couple of bites I found it did get quite one note. It needed a bit of cream or something else to cut through all the chocolate to make it more sophisticated (for me, at least). Dug out with some whipped cream or ice cream would both give you diabetes and likely hit the spot. I also found the tub format quite difficult o eat from in this case - the top of the cake stuck to the lid and you really had to dig out the cake. It is definitely cake for if you are going through a Bridget Jones style break up and want to eat your feelings with a chocolate cake rather than a pint of ice cream. If i wanted a more sophisticated cake that wasn’t entirely chocolate overload (though there’s a time and a place for that ofc) I’d definitely go for the chocolate/salted caramel offering from Mint Cakery. 

Black Forest Tub (no photo):
This was layers of chocolate cake sandwiched between cherries and cream. Again the same issue with the Bruce tub where the top stuck to the lid (if you care about ⭐️aesthetics⭐️. However this did what I needed the Bruce to do - the creamy layer cut through the richness of the cake and the cherries added great sour/tartness. I really enjoyed this one and would get it again instantly.

Tiramisu Cake Tub (no photo):
Italian nonnas of generations past are probably rolling somewhere because While yummy, unfortunately not a Tiramisu in my mind. This might be one where you need the authentic dairy experience. The coffee and booze notes needed to be stronger and the creamy layer didn’t have quite the same decadent quality of a mascarpone tiramisu. Still yummy though but if you want a proper tiramisu you might be disappointed. 

Peanut Butter and Chocolate Mini Cake:
My favourite. Would eat again and again. A moist chocolate cake with a creamy top that you can’t tell isn’t dairy cut with a peanut butter sauce and crunchy peanut bits. Delightful. No notes. Covered in gold glitter too which appeals to the ✨fancy 🌟 in me.

Ginger Kisses:
Good old fashioned home baking. I love a ginger kiss. These are massive and nicely subtly flavoured. You can tell the cream filling isn’t dairy based as it tastes a little ‘different’ but I didn’t find this to be a negative. Good second day too.

Lemon and Passionfruit and Lemon and Raspberry Mini Cakes:
I’m a bit of a lemon cake snob as too often I have had a lemon cake that isn’t remotely lemony. These are nicely lemon flavoured (though I wouldn’t overwhelmingly so) and very moist. The icing on top I found to be slightly bland and needed the fruit syrup to liven it up - which it did delightfully. The meringue kiss on top was also delightful. 

Chocolate and Raspberry Mini Cake:
At the risk of sounding repetitive here, the same as above applies to this cake. The chocolate cake itself is moist and nicely flavoured. The icing on top is not overly sweet and so is nicely enhanced by the raspberry coulis which makes it just the right amount of sweetness. Again you can tell the frosting is plant based in the mini cake. Interestingly it wasn’t so noticeable in the chocolate peanut butter one - maybe a slightly different recipe with some PB incorporated into it? That isn’t to say its off putting, just a different experience from the standard dairy based frosting (of course). 

The coffee: 
Solid. Never fear: you can get dairy based milk as well as the special stuff. To be honest I’m not really going here for the coffee and am not really a coffee expert but I’ve been happy each time.

I mentioned to her that my nevermo friends watched it and were asking me questions like, ""How come Mormons can't drink coffee or tea, but can have tons of soda and, you know, ketamine."" Her first response was, ""What's ketamine?"" I guess I should have seen that coming. 

After I explained it, though, she admitted it sounded bad and even though she thought they were wrong, she understood why they wouldn't feel like it broke WoW because it's not explicitly against the rules-- not to mention that it was administered by a doctor, so they might have thought it was like a prescription? 

I guess I was overcome with the spirit of contention, because I just started spurting problematic facts about the WoW-- we don't follow it the way it was intended, Joseph meant \*literal\* ""hot drinks,"" the whole thing was massively changed around the prohibition, there's a ton of studies showing the benefits of both coffee and tea, etc. Even though I info-dumped exmo facts, I kept my tone respectful. I didn't actually mean to go off, the words just hit my mouth before they passed through my brain, and when she seemed down I kept going. Keep in mind, she seemed to fully accept all of this, and was even nodding through a lot of it. She even emphatically agreed when I said it was so much unhealthier for people to drink energy drinks and tons of soda instead of coffee and tea. And she was even on board when I said I wished they'd change the WoW to be more about common sense health decisions instead of outdated rules. I finished it all with something like, ""With all the changes they're making, maybe they'll make coffee and tea okay, soon.""

And after all of that, she was like, ""Well, even if they do, I'll never drink them."" And she said it in the most TBM tone you can imagine-- you know the one. It's so frustrating, because she can see the problems, she can see how the rules as they are now let people convince themselves ketamine is not against the rules (even though she feels it is), she sees that the WoW isn't actually healthy, and yet I am sure she will follow it to her grave and seeing the issues with it won't so much as leave a smudge on her testimony.

1l3nyoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_0Baby0Driver0/comments/1l3nyoz/universal_electronics_inc_ueic_remote_but_not/,"Universal Electronics Inc. (UEIC): Remote, But Not Forgotten","I’m going to continue posting writeups on investments I genuinely believe are undervalued. I’ll try to stay consistent with these, but just a heads-up it takes a good amount of time and research to dig deep into each name, and I’m doing this solo. That said, I enjoy the process, and if you get some solid returns out of it too, even better. Cheers.

One quick note: I won’t be disclosing how many shares I own in any of these companies just my average cost basis. I’ll also mention if I plan to add to a position. I’m not here to manage your money, but I do want to share some alpha and lay out my thinking, instead of letting the research just sit on my hard drives or float around in my head.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m not one to chase the next hot SaaS name or some flashy “AI disruptor” that’s trading at 30x sales. What grabs my attention are unloved, under covered micro and small-cap stocks, the kind of companies nobody’s talking about on CNBC. That’s where inefficiencies live. UEIC fits that mold perfectly. It's a name I stumbled into, did the work on, and ultimately took a position in currently owning at an average cost of $9.209. I'm not here to sell you dreams just laying out why I think the market’s sleeping on this one. 

Now let’s be honest: UEIC isn’t sexy. They make remotes, smart thermostats, IR blasters, and some backend software that helps devices communicate. It’s not the type of product you Instagram. But boring doesn’t mean broken. In fact, boring businesses often print the best returns, especially when they’ve been beaten down like this one. 

Headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, Universal Electronics Inc. has been around since 1986. They specialize in wireless control tech for smart homes and entertainment systems. Their hardware and cloud-based software power many devices you likely use without thinking the remotes from your cable provider, HVAC interfaces from Daikin, and other household controls. They’re embedded in the ecosystem. The market, however, priced them as if they’re on the brink of irrelevance like a remote lost in your couch cushions. 

What makes things more interesting is Immersion Corporation (IMMR), which now owns nearly 12% of UEIC and has Eric Singer IMMR’s CEO sitting as UEIC’s Chairman. That’s not a coincidence. While there hasn’t been a formal activist campaign launched (yet), it sure smells like something is brewing. When someone builds a stake that large and starts planting board members, they usually aren’t just there for free coffee. 

Financially, UEIC’s Q1 2025 results were fine, not earth-shattering, but stable. They did $92.3 million in revenue, a slight increase year-over-year, with growth in the connected home segment offsetting declines in traditional entertainment. The headline here isn’t the growth rate, it’s the fact that they’re generating $90M+ in quarterly revenue, still positive on gross margins, and trading at a market cap of just $87 million. That disconnect is where the opportunity lies. 

The company has taken a scalpel to its operations. It’s closed unprofitable factories, moved production to Vietnam, cut SG&A, and is targeting 30% gross margins in the near term. It’s no longer the bloated version of its former self. With just \~$27 million in cash, manageable debt, and no financial red flags, the balance sheet is clean. They’ve also bought back shares in recent quarters, signaling management knows this thing is dirt cheap.

 One overlooked point: they’re not just a random parts supplier. UEIC has tier-one clients like Comcast and Daikin, plus proprietary tech like QuickSet that’s embedded across a wide swath of connected devices. That gives them an economic moat, albeit a quiet one. 

The bear case largely revolves around soft demand post-COVID and the secular decline in traditional TV. Fair enough. But what happens if demand stabilizes or even modestly rebounds in connected devices? With all the fat trimmed, a small revenue bump could translate into outsized earnings growth. 

Valuation-wise, this thing is a textbook value play. Based on a 5-year average EV/EBITDA multiple of 16.99 and a normalized EBITDA of $23.9 million, you get an implied enterprise value of \~$406 million. Back out the net debt and divide by the share count (\~13.1 million), and you land on a price target of $32.55 a clean 370% upside from current levels. That’s not based on fantasy either, it’s anchored in historic operating norms, with plenty of room for upside if activist pressure builds or growth reaccelerates. 

Bottom line: UEIC is one of those names that looks boring on the surface, but the numbers and the setup tell a different story. In a market obsessed with narratives, sometimes it pays to focus on value hiding in plain sight.",1,1749090123.0,u_0Baby0Driver0,0,1.0,False
1l3nx9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l3nx9a/some_of_my_thoughts_on_the_endings/,Some of my thoughts on the endings,"Hey guys  
I just spoil/finish some endings, and it keeps my brain running on Overclock mode. And I don’t want to make my partner feels tired about my endless yapping on something they don’t even play, so I decided to let it all out here with you guys: my thoughts, my feelings, and my emotions. Disclaimer: I only romance Judy and Panam so far.

**The Sun**  
*“The Sun symbolizes success. It is a card of freedom, renewal and a bright future that lies ahead. The Sun also represents truth, for its light will always pull back the curtain of shadow that hides the world's secrets. It is* *also represents greatness and splendor”*

On the surface, this ending brings all the glory and splendour of being at the top of the major leagues. It’s a fulfilled dream for which you and Jackie sacrificed everything to achieve: A penthouse at the city centre, travelling around with top-tier cab service, having people call you “boss”, and hell, even your clothes are golden now. It’s the light at the end of the tunnel, the rainbow after the rain, and the dawn after the cold night. “The Sun” here means a happy, glorious ending.

However, what intrigued me about this ending was what Mr. Blue Eyes said, that this heist is almost impossible. It reminded me of the Greek story of Icarus flying too close to the sun. It once again leads to a question: Will the Crystal Palace heist be the time when V’s wax wings finally melt? Which leads to an open-ended question: “How much fame is enough?”. They said when you are at the bottom, there is nowhere to go but up; however, when do you stop? In this ending, V postponed precious and possibly final hours of their lives to chase this ambition. “The Sun” means the dangers beneath the lure of fame, like a moth to the flame.

One notable thing is that wherever the sun shines, shadow follows. Sooner or later, the shadow will catch up when the sun goes down. Which makes me wonder: Is this chase for fame and fortune simply a way for V to forget the looming death coming closer every day? So many people fill their bucket lists with all the thrills and excitement to enjoy life to its fullest before they say goodbye to this world. It’s not wrong to do that, however, this comes at the cost of losing precious time with your loved ones. This is why, in my opinion, I can wholeheartedly understand the sadness in all of your in-game romance options, especially Judy. “The Sun” means a way to forget the shadows behind you.

If I am optimistic, I will believe this would be a successful heist (and it better be since lv 52 Netrunning is OP), and whatever Mr. Blue Eyes promised was the cure for V’s condition. Hey, maybe you can become So Mi’s roommate on the Moon station, and you both can be Moon besties. That way, “The Sun” can finally be the light at the end of the tunnel. I chose this ending when my V does not pick romance options, because leaving V’s partner to chase fame shows they are always number 2 in V’s life.

**The Star**

*“The Star is the card of hope. In the darkest of nights there is a light that shines the path to home. The Star is inspiration, motivation and gives us strength to move forward.”*

A small fact that I have loved ever since I was young: travellers, sailors, and nomads used stars as guidance to the right direction. And this ending captured this fact well. V left during the night, left all comforts, fame, and fortune behind and sought new hopes beyond Night City. “The Star” means a glimmer of hope and guidance beyond the horizon.

I also find it quite interesting that the Sun is a star and it is the closest star to our Earth. Hence, one could interpret that “The Sun” is the obvious, vivid, but short-term happy ending, while “The Star” is the shimmering, unclear, but long-term happy ending. It takes courage to leave the obvious ones behind to chase the uncertainties. Some may call it false hope, which I can understand. There is no guarantee that whatever V seeks out of Night City will be the answer to V’s illness. But sometimes, the long-term solution is better in the end. “The Star” means the courage to step out of comfort and seek better answers.

And like any voyages or expeditions that our ancestors have done for thousands of years, no one does it alone. And our V is also the same. V has Aldecaldos (and Judy) with them on this journey. They might be the people who help V find the cure, or they might be the ones holding V’s hand when V is ready to meet Jackie. Surrounded by loved ones is the joy that no amount of gold could buy. “The Star” does not burn bright like “The Sun”, yet it is still comforting. For me, “The Star” is not just hope, it is the realisation of what is true happiness in life all along for V.

Who knows what lies ahead? Hell, if NUSA can cure V in The Tower, now imagine if the Aldecaldos travel to D.C, get some deals with insiders and V’s big wallet (Hey, V has 6 months to live, more than enough to 100% NC quests), maybe V can heal while having their new family care for during coma. And if everything fails, hey, at least the Aldecaldos can visit V’s grave annually.

One caveat of this ending led to the death of many Aldecaldos. I usually imagine V solo entire Arasaka Tower (again lv 52 Netrunning is OP), then head to Aldecaldos camp and say bye-bye to NC. Hence, I love this ending, especially when I twist the ending that way. Also big plus is Judy will finally be somewhere she is truly happy, which is a big plus (she needs hug badly).

**The Tower**

*“The Tower is an omen of radical change, chaos and destruction. The lightning striking The Tower signifies a return to the old order that lies buried under the ruins, and a new order that will rise from it. It is a symbol of tragedy, apocalypse, and self-destruction.”*

From what I have been reading in many cyberpunk subreddits, I can agree, this is one of, if not the most controversial ending to analyse. Now, let’s assume we do not consider the logic behind some of the choices here (as in I cannot see what’s so hard about texting the loved ones: “Hey babe, I found a cure, but I will go to this without knowing what will happen to me. Can we talk about this together?”). This is the only ending where the cure is not a hope, it’s a reality instead. However, the big question for this ending is: “What have you lost?” In this ending, V lost loved ones, career, fame, and the power to even defend themselves. In Night City, where these are the real currencies to judge one’s worth, this puts V back to ground zero. “The Tower” of V crumbled down and became ruined.

However, this becomes an open-ended question for V: How would V build “The Tower of V” from here? V fought against all odds for a third chance to live, not to survive. And V achieved it at a steep cost. So what would V do now? Earn fame again as Merc without cyberware (maybe, with a Tier 5++ Warden SMG)? Be a smart investor (I mean, some of the apartments that V bought are one-time payments, isn’t it?)? Maybe become a fixer? Or just say screw NC I will find somewhere safer? Nowhere to go but up from here, isn’t it? A ruined “Tower” might just be a great opportunity to build a better one on top of it.

And to be honest, although the way CDPR pointed out that everyone you knew moved on after 2 years looks gloomy, I sincerely think it’s realistic. Life goes on, and they cannot be left behind in their lives, especially in such an unforgiving world like that. It sucks, yes, but hey, it’s understandable. Now it’s V’s turn to move on from their past life. That’s why “The Tower” signifies destruction, crisis, but it also signifies liberation and a new start. In some ways, “The Tower” is the opposite of “The Star” and “The Sun”, where V successfully get their life back but has to find the meaning of this new life. It’s two sides of the same coin. So, as I would say, who knows, maybe there is a better ending out there later for V. Maybe someone better than Panam/Judy waiting for them in Night City. Most people in our real world have to date a second or third time to find the true soul mate anyway, right? Maybe V can get a desk job in FIA, as Reed mentioned (should be high enough salary, I suppose). Maybe live a nice life in D.C, use whatever Cyberpunk 2077’s equivalent to Tinder or Bumble, go on a date and start a new life. Also, drop by New Turkey for a hair and eyebrow transplant. And I can see it’s the start of a good life (just remember V sold Songbird out for this so maybe pay a bit more for anti-netrunning gears just in case. The girl can’t Burnout synapse non-cyberware V, but she surely can explode Infuso coffee machine).

So I would interpret this ending could be the ending that happens once V tried all V could in other endings and leads nowhere. So V decides to ring Reed for the treatment.

Unfortunately, I have not done much thinking on The Devil and The Temperance ending so imma leave it there… for now. So imma just summarise my thoughts for them briefly.

*“The Star is the card of hope. In the darkest of nights there is a light that shines the path to home. The Star is inspiration, motivation and gives us strength to move forward.”*

A small fact that I have loved ever since I was young: travellers, sailors, and nomads used stars as guidance to the right direction. And this ending captured this fact well. V left during the night, left all comforts, fame, and fortune behind and sought new hopes beyond Night City. “The Star” means a glimmer of hope and guidance beyond the horizon.

I also find it quite interesting that the Sun is a star and it is the closest star to our Earth. Hence, one could interpret that “The Sun” is the obvious, vivid, but short-term happy ending, while “The Star” is the shimmering, unclear, but long-term happy ending. It takes courage to leave the obvious ones behind to chase the uncertainties. Some may call it false hope, which I can understand. There is no guarantee that whatever V seeks out of Night City will be the answer to V’s illness. But sometimes, the long-term solution is better in the end. “The Star” means the courage to step out of comfort and seek better answers.

And like any voyages or expeditions that our ancestors have done for thousands of years, no one does it alone. And our V is also the same. V has Aldecaldos (and Judy) with them on this journey. They might be the people who help V find the cure, or they might be the ones holding V’s hand when V is ready to meet Jackie. Surrounded by loved ones is the joy that no amount of gold could buy. “The Star” does not burn bright like “The Sun”, yet it is still comforting. For me, “The Star” is not just hope, it is the realisation of what is true happiness in life all along for V.

Who knows what lies ahead? Hell, if NUSA can cure V in The Tower, now imagine if the Aldecaldos travel to D.C, get some deals with insiders and V’s big wallet (Hey, V has 6 months to live, more than enough to 100% NC quests), maybe V can heal while having their new family care for during coma. And if everything fails, hey, at least the Aldecaldos can visit V’s grave annually.

One caveat of this ending led to the death of many Aldecaldos. I usually imagine V solo entire Arasaka Tower (again lv 52 Netrunning is OP), then head to Aldecaldos camp and say bye-bye to NC. Hence, I love this ending, especially when I twist the ending that way. Also big plus is Judy will finally be somewhere she is truly happy, which is a big plus (she needs hug badly).

**The Tower**

*“The Tower is an omen of radical change, chaos and destruction. The lightning striking The Tower signifies a return to the old order that lies buried under the ruins, and a new order that will rise from it. It is a symbol of tragedy, apocalypse, and self-destruction.”*

From what I have been reading in many cyberpunk subreddits, I can agree, this is one of, if not the most controversial ending to analyse. Now, let’s assume we do not consider the logic behind some of the choices here (as in I cannot see what’s so hard about texting the loved ones: “Hey babe, I found a cure, but I will go to this without knowing what will happen to me. Can we talk about this together?”). This is the only ending where the cure is not a hope, it’s a reality instead. However, the big question for this ending is: “What have you lost?” In this ending, V lost loved ones, career, fame, and the power to even defend themselves. In Night City, where these are the real currencies to judge one’s worth, this puts V back to ground zero. “The Tower” of V crumbled down and became ruined.

However, this becomes an open-ended question for V: How would V build “The Tower of V” from here? V fought against all odds for a third chance to live, not to survive. And V achieved it at a steep cost. So what would V do now? Earn fame again as Merc without cyberware (maybe, with a Tier 5++ Warden SMG)? Be a smart investor (I mean, some of the apartments that V bought are one-time payments, isn’t it?)? Maybe become a fixer? Or just say screw NC I will find somewhere safer? Nowhere to go but up from here, isn’t it? A ruined “Tower” might just be a great opportunity to build a better one on top of it.

And to be honest, although the way CDPR pointed out that everyone you knew moved on after 2 years looks gloomy, I sincerely think it’s realistic. Life goes on, and they cannot be left behind in their lives, especially in such an unforgiving world like that. It sucks, yes, but hey, it’s understandable. Now it’s V’s turn to move on from their past life. That’s why “The Tower” signifies destruction, crisis, but it also signifies liberation and a new start. In some ways, “The Tower” is the opposite of “The Star” and “The Sun”, where V successfully get their life back but has to find the meaning of this new life. It’s two sides of the same coin. So, as I would say, who knows, maybe there is a better ending out there later for V. Maybe someone better than Panam/Judy waiting for them in Night City. Most people in our real world have to date a second or third time to find the true soul mate anyway, right? Maybe V can get a desk job in FIA, as Reed mentioned (should be high enough salary, I suppose). Maybe live a nice life in D.C, use whatever Cyberpunk 2077’s equivalent to Tinder or Bumble, go on a date and start a new life. Also, drop by New Turkey for a hair and eyebrow transplant. And I can see it’s the start of a good life (just remember V sold Songbird out for this so maybe pay a bit more for anti-netrunning gears just in case. The girl can’t Burnout synapse non-cyberware V, but she surely can explode Infuso coffee machine).

So I would interpret this ending could be the ending that happens once V tried all V could in other endings and leads nowhere. So V decides to ring Reed for the treatment.

Unfortunately, I have not done much thinking on The Devil and The Temperance ending so imma leave it there… for now. So imma just summarise my thoughts for them briefly.  
  
**The Devil:** I don’t trust that 78-year-old porcelain b\*\*ch, and I turned out I was correct.

  
**The Temperance:** Not gonna lie, the thought of Johnny’s soul in Fem V’s body would make Alt Cunningham smile ear to ear.",2,1749089899.0,LowSodiumCyberpunk,1,1.0,False

1l3nvte,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3nvte/my_second_son_part_1/,My Second Son (Part 1),"I’m posting my story here because I need someone else to listen. I wrote this six years ago, and due to recent events regarding my son, I dug through my files to find this document. I reread the events that played out years ago, and now my memories are all that remain bouncing around in my brain. I feel as if posting this here will free these memories from my head, sending my worst moments deep into the void of the internet. Even if these words land on someone else’s ears in some strange coincidence, I don’t think I can bear to read the comments. I cannot bear to see my morality questioned by another person's mind. So here is to six years of regret:

The last normal day of my life is what I reflect upon most when I remember anything from then. That day was just as similar to the previous day as any other. I remember running through the woods, looking left and right as if something were chasing me. The trees in front of me were almost magically out of my path as I ran. I have no idea what I could have been running from, but I felt a steady anxiety, a pang in my chest. Eventually, I was stopped by something vibrantly glowing in front of me, something I only saw from the corner of my eye as I attempted to peer behind my running feet.

I looked forward and stopped immediately. It was a tree, a perfect, picturesque tree with a round frame, bright green leaves, and a strong body. The trunk was thick, but the top couldn't have been higher than thirty feet. I stopped and was enthralled by this story-like tree. It was not a calming feeling, but a feeling of rush, of excitement maybe, as I took a step forward to it. I looked at the lowest hanging branch and saw two apples. Two perfect apples bobbing delicately from the tree, asking to be picked. My heart beat faster as I closed in on the red-hanging fruit. I reached out to grab it, softly plucking it from the loose twig it held onto. I felt a sudden sensation of saliva filling my mouth. Never had I seen an apple this delicious, or any food for that matter.

I brought it to my mouth, sinking my incisors into the soft flesh of the fruit, expecting a sweet taste and a fragrant smell. Instead, I scrunched my nose up as my tongue retreated further into my mouth. It tasted bitter, acrid, on my tongue. I pulled it out of my mouth to see that the object I was holding was not an apple, but instead, a pomegranate. I spit the white flesh and purple-red seeds from my mouth onto the ground. The tiny pieces flecked off the hard earth when I heard a shrill screaming noise. “Scree! Scree! Scree!,” it repeated. I looked at the pomegranate I had just bitten and watched as the red juices flowing out of its wound spilled into my hand and down my arm. It was the revolting, sticky feeling of melted sugar, and that’s when I opened my eyes. I had been dreaming, and my alarm clock had been going berserk for the past five minutes.

I reached my hand over and smacked the top of the alarm. I moved my legs in bed to realize that I felt something warm and wet. I pulled the covers off of my body to see, for the first time since I was a child, I had wet the bed. I felt embarrassed and disgusted with myself. ""How could I let something so stupid and childish happen?"" I thought. I jumped out of bed and headed straight for the shower. I was going to take one anyway, I guess. 

After brushing my teeth, starting my coffee, and other than the whole “accident” I had earlier, I had an otherwise stereotypical morning. I went to Danny’s room, waking him up, and congratulating him on not wetting the bed tonight, unlike his mother. We both ate breakfast, some cheap waffle meal I had thrown into the microwave, although he acted like I was a five-star chef. Other times, to him, I was some hoodlum they had brought off the street for help in the kitchen; my food usually ended up on the floor and promptly into the trash.

I put on my first uniform and grabbed my second uniform from the dryer, putting it into the car. I helped Danny comb his hair, although he fussed and wanted to move his head around like a chicken pecking at ants. I even thought of offering that he could comb my hair, but the last time we tried that, he found a knot at the end of my hair and nearly scalped me with one strong rip of the brush. We did everything together in the morning.

I rushed him out to the car and put him into his car seat in the back and strapped him in with little resistance that morning. I got into the front seat, turned the car on, and, while normally we would listen to music, I felt like talking to someone this morning. 

“Danny.” His head shot up from wherever he was ambiently staring, surely falling asleep, as he started his stare at me.

“Yes, mama?” He said in his now, mostly intelligible, yet sleepy voice.

“Do you like going to Beth’s?” I asked, thinking of anything to say that would pertain to his consciousness.

“Yes,” he said with an extended “sss” noise before pausing and adding more to his childish statement.

“I like yours more.”

I remember feeling somewhat saddened by his statement. I knew he liked to be at our house more, even though he spent most of his days at his babysitter’s. We remained in silence, stopping to turn as I felt the deafening, beating silence of the turn signal clicking, like a clock counting the seconds down of... something. I piped up, feeling awkward myself; he did not care.

“I’ll get to see you Sunday,” I said in a cheery voice and gave him a toothful smile in the mirror. He didn’t return any of the same emotion and started up his voice again, monotone.

“How long is Sunday?” I froze up, and I started to fumble my words.

“It’s… a few days…” He replied with one word.

“Long.”

I dropped him off at Beth’s and thanked her. Usually, I would have stayed longer, but that day, I felt my words should be short. I drove off to work, my first job of the day. I worked two jobs at the time. My first shift job was at a local diner. I had known the family for quite some time, and they offered me a job after they learned my husband had left me with Danny. The job was easy, and I picked it up quickly: washing dishes, waiting tables, food prep, and the occasional unruly bathroom cleaning. Fortunately, there wasn’t any of the latter that day, just a regular workday with regular people and below regular pay. That’s why I got a second job.

My second shift was spent in a wholly unruly gas station that could never stay clean. While it wasn’t the hardest job, it usually left me beat after spending all night selling customers our new deals and new items in between cooking, cleaning, stocking, and whatever else was on my list. There was one good thing about this job, though: I had made a friend.

I usually stuck to myself and stayed quiet, but one woman couldn’t help but talk to me. Her name was Tiffany, but most just called her Tiff. She was about 40 or 50, I couldn’t tell. It seems like gas stations have a severe effect on your physical and mental health in some way. She appeared quite brutish and could come off that way to unsuspecting customers. She was one of the few people who looked after me, though, mostly because her husband cheated on her with three different women over two years, and she just loved to tell that story. She had a rather complicated fiery hatred for men. 

Whenever I wasn’t talking to a customer, I was talking to her. It made my day go by faster, and it felt good to use my mouth for something other than useless store propaganda and jargon. Her favorite thing to talk about was Danny, though. She loved to see any picture of him, and any mention of him had her ears perked up like a cropped Doberman. I don’t think she had ever even met him before, but I think she just missed her children who didn’t speak to her. Most of the day went by slowly, other than some teenage kid who didn’t know how to use the gas pump and ended up with gasoline covering half the parking lot when it fell out of his tank.

As my night was coming to an end, Tiff called me outside to “take a break.” I walked outside and felt the cool, fresh summer night air as the streetlights cast a green overlay on the side of the brick building. I leaned back against the wall, next to the trash can as Tiff did the same while she lit up a cigarette.

“So, you got any plans for your future?” she said, the cigarette hanging from her lip, before she used two fingers to pull it to the middle, sucking in the chemicals and letting out a big burst of smoke, fanning it away with her hand. I stood for a while, just thinking before responding.

“No. Not really,” I answered truthfully.

“You’re still young, you can make it. You ever thought about headin’ back to school?” she said before letting out another big puff.

“Don’t have time. I have Danny,” I said, still looking up at the green-tinted black sky.

“You ever gonna move out of that dump you live in?” I was taken aback at her harsh words before rationalizing them in my head as “This is a woman who’s spent her whole life working in a gas station.” I knew my house wasn’t very nice, but I couldn’t afford anything more, and rarely did I have the time to clean or mow the lawn.

“I’ve looked. It’s about the cheapest there is. I can’t go much higher than that.”

“Ever thought of getting a better job?” she answered with a rebuttal.

“I’ve looked there too. Most places I see need some sort of license or pay close to minimum wage.” 

“Gas station ain’t gonna cut it. I could help look for you. I think I could get some connections,” she said, lending out a metaphorical hand.

“I… I think I’m alright,” I replied, shooing that said hand away. She finished her cigarette and scrunched it up against the wall, making a black smudge, before throwing it on the sidewalk, and turning to face me.

“Girl, you need help. And I know it's just gonna get worse. Wait til you get knocked up by some other man and got two kids on your hands. Then what’re you gonna do?” she said, more enthusiastically, presumably getting fired up about her own life. I stopped staring up at the sky and faced her.

“I’m not gonna go and do something like that. I don’t think I need a relationship right now. I just... need Danny and that’s it.” Her ears perked up at the mention of my son.

“That’s the right thinking.” She looked at the clock through the window of the gas station, mouthing “ten o’clock” before looking at me and smiling. 

“Looks like it's your time to go.” I looked up at the clock and looked back at her.

“Seems so.”

I clocked out of work and told her my goodbyes, walking out to my car. I headed back to Beth’s to pick up Danny. I felt supremely tired on this drive and found myself shutting my eyes on more than one occasion. I reached her house and pulled into the driveway, Beth already standing on the porch holding Danny’s little hand as he rubbed his eye with the other. He looked like he had just woken up and was more than a little grumpy. I got out of the car and walked up to the porch, giving a friendly wave at them. Beth gave a warm smile and a full wave. Danny gave a frowny face and a half-hearted effortless wave with a hand that never left his body.

“Are you ready to go home?” I said enthusiastically, even though I felt entirely exhausted.

“Yeah,” he replied before yawning and stretching. Beth and I shared smiles unbeknownst to him.

“Come on, let's get you home then,” I said, taking his eye-rubbing hand with two of my fingers and leading him down the steep porch stairs and into the running car. I lifted him to his seat and buckled him in, his tired eyes shutting over and over before finally his head slumped over by the end of the process. I smiled at him and quietly shut the door, walking back up the porch to talk to Beth.

“So, how was he today?” I said once I finally reached the porch.

“Rotten as always.”

“Did he eat his food?""

“He was a bit skeptical, but he ended up eating it once he tasted it. He was pretty good today. We watched cartoons and colored. I’m sure he’ll tell you all about it tomorrow."" She raised her hand and moved them out, vaguely referencing something big in a childlike way, before her face fell and became more unhappy.

""Well... during his nap he did have a bad dream, but he got over it pretty quickly.”

“Aw. Was it the big bumblebee coming to sting him again?” Her face lit up again, probably thinking of the number of times they had dealt with the same situation.

“No, not this time. He woke up crying and had peed all over himself. He said something about ‘getting eaten.’ Maybe he just didn’t like the food I made that much.” I stopped and thought for a moment. That was weird. 

“Didn’t know he was having some sort of cannibal dream. You haven’t let him watch any scary movies, have you?” 

“No. Course not. Just cartoons.”

“He used to watch cartoons all the time with his dad,” I said a bit hesitant, still a fresh wound. I made a cringing face after that comment, and there was a long pause, interrupted by the tapping of Beth’s fingers on the wooden post of the porch. A sudden cold gust of wind ran through the beams, straight through my body.

“So… you hear about him?” she said, trying to rip off the Band-aid of a still-bleeding cut. I sighed.

“Yeah… I heard.”

“Prison… didn’t think he was one for drugs.” Another long pause before she started speaking again, the wailing of windchimes next to us as the wind picked up.

“Where are you gonna send Danny this summer? Thought you were gonna become a CNA?”

“I… don’t know. It just happened so fast, I haven’t really had time to think about it… I’m sorry.” I looked down at my feet, as did she, feeling the back of my throat burn and tears well up, but I managed to force them down. A rather strong gust of wind came through and whistled through the houses and leaves of the trees, leaving me frigid. I turned to look at the sky and saw gray clouds brewing in the distance of the black sky.

“Didn’t think it was supposed to storm tonight? Weather channel said clear skies for the next week,” she said from behind me.

“That is weird,” I said in an emotionless and slow voice, mesmerized by the swirls of the clouds and the winds. I twisted my body back to face her and put on a fake smile.

“I best get to leaving. I'll see you in the morning.”

“Bye, Tori,” she said as she looked at me and waved, before turning back and heading into the house as I hurried to the car. I got in and looked at the backseat, he was still sound asleep. I started the short drive back to our house, or as Danny had called it, “your house.” The sky was turning significantly darker, darker than black. I was surprised it hadn’t started raining yet.

I got home and parked the car, getting out to quietly bring my softly sleeping son inside. I carried him in my arms when I felt a raindrop on my head. I leered up at the sky and then down at Danny. A fat raindrop fell from the sky and landed directly on his forehead. His nose scrunched up, but otherwise, he remained calmly asleep. I got him inside and laid him on his bed, taking his shoes off and pulling the covers over him. My pursed lips met his forehead, right where that misplaced raindrop had landed. He didn’t open his eyes. He didn’t make a noise. He didn’t move an inch. I was done for the day.

The rain had started pouring down in monsoon levels. The windows had become a blurry mess of moving images behind a wall of white. Thunder could be heard, quite distant, but coming closer. It was the type of atmosphere that seemed perfect for getting a good night's sleep. I slipped off my gas station uniform and got into my pajamas, the ones that hadn’t been soaked the prior night. I climbed into bed, more so crawled. I was exhausted and that day had been terribly long. I pulled the covers over myself and turned onto my side. I grabbed the other pillow from the headboard and held the soft object tightly in my arms.

I lay there for a while, before opening my eyes and looking at the other side of the bed. It was perfectly flat; mine had a dent in it. This was enough to make me cry. I held onto the pillows tightly and buried my face into them. I remember thinking “Why did he have to be so stupid? Why can’t he be here now? Why can’t he raise his son? Why doesn't he think I'm attractive anymore?” I cried and cried and cried, softly whimpering into the pillows, trying not to be loud, when I heard a sudden crash. I pulled my head up, shocked, thinking Danny had fallen out of his bed, before realizing the noise was just the loud boom of thunder. It frightened me enough to stop crying. I turned to lay on my back and tried to go to sleep for real that time. It worked.

I had another dream that night. This time, I was in the same woods, but it was much darker. It was night and I wasn’t running. I remembered the tree from the dream before, although I usually can’t think about much of anything in dreams. I walked until I found that tree again. It had lost all its light, and the pomegranate I had picked off of it had lain on the earth. I looked up at the other pomegranate on the tree and moved up to it. The fruit was shriveled and twisted. I moved my hand up to it and inspected the fetid object. It was definitely an apple, no doubt about it. I looked around for other fruit on the tree, but those were the only two. I didn’t dare pick the only apple left. Instead, I turned around when I felt something brush up against my back. Something warm and small.

I gasped as my eyes opened like I had just surfaced from the bottom of the ocean. I hadn’t wet the bed this time, but I felt I may have been close. I still felt that warm feeling on my back before it moved. I lurched my back and quickly turned over, pushing myself off the bed and standing. I was on high alert. I thought maybe a mouse had gotten into my bed, but it was too big. A stray cat couldn’t have gotten in, but then I saw what it was. It was Danny. He lay curled up, right where I was, looking at me with bewildered eyes.

“What wrong, Mama?” he said with a confused tone. I breathed a sigh of relief and brought my hand to my chest, feeling how hard my heart was beating. I gently sat down on the bed next to him.

“Bad dream. I’m okay now.”

“The bumblebee?” he asked in an almost scared voice, making me smile and exhale through my nose.

“No, not the bumblebee one. Different people have different dreams.”

“The apple one?”

My blood ran cold. I stared at him for a while with wide eyes and deep breaths. I had to rationalize it in my head. He was learning. One of the first items he learned about was an apple. Yes, A is for Apple. He couldn’t have known, but I remembered the dream that Beth had told me. I needed to stop thinking.

I climbed back into bed and looked at him hesitantly, he was already dozing off again. I slowly wrapped my arms around him, as I did the pillow from before. I held him tightly, not letting go as he slept in my arms. After what seemed like hours, I fell back asleep. No dreams this time.

It was the last normal day of my life.

I heard the loud shrill of the alarm “Scree! Scree! Scree!” before I slipped my arm out from under Danny and turned the alarm off. He lay in bed soundly asleep as I got up and started my morning. I showered, started my coffee, and started breakfast. I returned to my bed to wake Danny up and bring him to his room to get him dressed and ready for the day. I rustled him until he swatted his arm out like a brave little three-year-old. I rustled him some more until he fully woke up.

“Danny, get up. You gotta go to Beth’s.”

“No. I’m seepy.”

“Come on, get up.”

He groaned and turned onto his side. I got a playful spark of idea. I ran my finger up his side and started tickling his armpit. He started giggling and screamed “Stop, stop, stop!” before I finally did stop. I looked at him laughing. I hadn’t laughed in a while. He seemed to be the only one who could make me laugh.

“You gonna get up now?” He gave his best grumpy face before I pulled him along, he followed reluctantly, afraid of the tickle monster. I brought him to his room, thinking about how he had to have made the same trip the night before. He had never come to sleep in my bed, but since he had graduated from a crib, I guess he could have. I couldn't help to wonder why. Maybe it was a bad dream. I held his hand and pulled him along behind me, as he was rubbing his eyes again. I opened his bedroom door and turned on his light, turning back to look at him.

“What do you want to wear today?” I said cheerfully before turning back and stopping.

My whole body froze.

In his bed, I saw a mass under the pillows. It scared me at first before I realized those must be his stuffed animals all bundled up under his blanket in a perfectly Danny-shaped form. That’s what I told myself, but I felt something bad. My hair stood on end as I slowly walked towards the bed, letting go of Danny’s hand, leaving him at the doorframe as my heart beat faster and faster. I slowly inched forward, thinking about how I was going to pull off the blanket like a Band-aid, fast and quick. 

*There’s just a dinosaur under there. Just a big ol’ mean dinosaur, Tori. That’s it. Just pull it off. Nothing to be scared of. Maybe even a big bumblebee.*

I stood over the bed and put my arms out, ready to pull the blanket off at any moment, but I couldn’t. That's when Danny piped up from the doorway.

“Mama?” he asked questioningly before I heard something beneath me. I looked down to see rustling in the bed. My heart sank. I thought I was dead. I didn’t know what to do. That’s when a little grubby arm popped out from under the blanket. I didn’t scream like they do in horror movies. I was just frozen, unable to breathe or move. The arm kept moving back and forth, wriggling around and bumping the stuffed animals off of the bed to my feet. The monster revealed itself more and more until the covers came completely off. It was Danny. I stared in bewilderment, looking down at the young thing in my son’s bed as it rubbed its eyes. I turned around to look at the doorway. Danny was there too, standing patiently, rubbing his eyes. The boy in the bed looked up at me.

“What wrong, Mama?”

I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. How could I have two sons? Two of the same son? Maybe one of them was a different boy I picked up from Beth's. Maybe one of them was a kid from the street who just happened to look, sound, and talk like Danny. Maybe one of them was some sort of monster… but monsters aren’t real. The two boys stood across from each other, paying no attention to one another, only to me. I thought maybe only one of them would know only what Danny could know.

“Hey… Danny?” I said slowly through a shuddering breath.

“Yes, Mama,” both of them said in perfect unison. Perfect. Not a pitch different. I started shivering.

“What’s your favorite color?”

“Bwue,” they both said at the exact same time, the same impediment, the same everything.

“How old are you?” I said, asking another simple question. Both of them giggled, it was the same giggle, the same peaks, the same chortle. 

“That’s silly, Mama. I’m Thwee,” they said in undeniable synchrony. They had to be the same. There was no difference, so I asked them the one thing that had been different.

“Where did you sleep last night?” I asked shakily.

“Mama bed.”

 “My bed.”

Both of them stopped looking at me and stared directly at each other, eyes glazed over and nothing was spoken. They stared for a while, the first time acknowledging each other before they both looked at me again.

“I’m hungry,” they both said when the one in the bed started to get up and walk towards me. I moved backward, pressing up against the corner as he moved closer. He stopped before he reached me.

“Where did you sleep the day before?” I spurted out.

“My bed,” they both replied, the other one’s little head poking around the corner of the doorway. They looked like two little aliens, slowly marching forward. I started to think. Maybe they can’t be in the same place at once. Maybe that’s why he came to sleep in my bed. I extended my finger and pointed toward the opposite corner of the room.

“Go stand in that corner, Danny.”

“Why, Mama?” they said.

“Because I said so,"" I stated authoritatively. They both walked over to the corner, standing side-by-side, not touching.

“Stand in the middle.”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I just can’t,” they said, acting like nothing was wrong. I slowly inched toward them, deeming them not to be a threat at the moment. At least one of them was my son. I decided to confront them directly.

“Do you see the boy standing next to you?” They giggled again.

“What you mean?”

“The boy standing right next to you that looks exactly like you.” They laughed even harder, probably finding it absurd. They turned and looked right at each other, their gazes passing through each other as their eyes darted around. I reached my arms out and snatched both of them by their little rubbery wrists. I started to pull them next to each other, trying to force them to touch. I angrily started yelling.

“Do you not see the boy!...” Their hands touched. Both of them fell to the ground and started screaming louder than I’d ever heard him scream before. The only other time that comes close was when he accidentally stepped on a piece of glass. They were screaming like they were being killed. They pushed themselves backward across the rooms, screaming and crying, trying to get as far away from me as possible.

“I hate you, Mama! I hate you! I hate you!” They both screamed as I covered my ears from the double assault. I ran out of the room, slamming the door shut behind me. I ran out into the hallway, out into the living room, and up against the front door. I was out of breath and placed up against the door, looking back terrified, waiting for them to come running at me. They didn't run, and they didn't come for me.

What was it in my son's room? I didn’t understand, and I don’t want to know. I sat against the door, trying to catch my breath when my phone began to buzz in my pocket. I fumbled around for it when I pulled it out of my pocket, nearly dropping the thing. The phone screen read “Beth” with a picture of her and her husband smiling in a family photo. I hesitantly answered the phone, holding it up to my ear.

“Hello?” I asked, thinking of nothing else to say.

“Hey, I was wondering where you were. You’re never late,” she said in a cheery voice. My eyes darted around until they landed on the clock to the oven. “7:55” I was late. I was late to Beth’s. I was late to work. I paused, spurting out an extended “um.”

“I’ll be there… soon.”

“Alright, good. Thought you weren’t gonna make it today.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll be there,” I said as I hung up, still on high alert and looking around for any sign of them. I slipped my phone into my pocket and looked over to see that breakfast was now completely ruined in the oven. It wasn’t on fire, but the food more resembled charcoal. I looked down to see that I did have my work uniform on and I was ready to go. I had everything besides Danny.

How was I going to explain to Beth that I had two Danny’s? It was impossible. “I have identical twins, and I’ve never let you once see them both at the same time.” There was no way anyone could believe that. I started to think or at least think the best I could. My brain was falling apart from the few hours of sleep I had and the adrenaline flowing through it for the past thirty minutes. Me and Danny had been through some rough times. I thought, and I thought. When his dad left, we could barely afford food. There were days when we may have only eaten once or twice, even when he cried. That’s when I thought of a terrible idea.

*“Can he last the whole day?”*

It was a terrible idea, but the situation seemed so dire at the time. One of them had to be a monster, something supernatural. If I got lucky, I would be sending my son to the babysitter. “But what happens if it’s a monster I send?” I thought. What happens if I send one Danny there that turns into a big bumblebee, one that kills them all? I didn’t know what it was capable of. I had only seen it for the past forty-five minutes. It could be the end of the world for all I know.

I looked back up at the clock. “8:02” I was supposed to be at work two minutes ago. I needed to hurry. I started to pick up my pace and face my fears. I ran through the hallway and to Danny’s bedroom door. I listened closely and heard soft breathing from the other side. It was faint. I slowly opened the door, expecting to see my son dead and some giant monster eating him. Instead, I saw two Dannys sitting side-by-side wiping away their dried tears on their red chubby faces. Both of them had crying faces on but looked like they had cried all they could. I felt terrible. I felt sick for what I knew I was going to do. I needed to know which one was the wrong Danny. I went back to the only difference I could think of. I didn’t even know if it was the right one.

“Hey, Danny.”

“Mama…,” they both started to cry again, shaking in tears.

“Did you like sleeping in Mama’s bed last night?” One of them looked at me a bit confused while the other one started to cry harder, exclaiming “Yeah!” They both stopped crying and looked at each other again, completely freezing and noticing each other’s differences. It was my time to do something rash. I jumped forward and grabbed the Danny who said “Yeah!” and pulled him up into my arms. I did not dare to look at the other Danny. I held him in my arms as I ran out into the hallway, making the same path to the living room as I had before. I flung the front door open and slammed it shut, running to my car. I moved him forcefully into his car seat and buckled him, he didn’t resist. He was just confused and scared.

I got into the front seat and pulled back out of the driveway, stepping hard onto the pedal and running it down the street, barely stopping at the stop sign. Danny started to pipe up.

“Mama, why you do that?” I cranked the volume knob on the radio nearly to the max, playing some song I had never heard, a song I didn’t even like. I didn’t want to hear him. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw him looking up at me before absentmindedly looking out the window. I remember thinking, “At least this Danny seems normal.” The drive to Beth’s house was silent apart from the music blaring over everything. As I pulled the car to the side of the road, I turned the music all the way down. I moved with haste, quickly unbuckling Danny and picking him up. 

I saw Beth on the porch waving toward me with her classic smile. I ran up to the porch and set Danny down on his own two legs, his face still red and raw from crying earlier. I looked up at Beth and said two words.

“Running late.” As I was running back to my car, she yelled out.

“See ya later!” I got in the car and floored it to work.

I quickly walked into the diner, expecting to be berated for my tardiness. I went to the back, checking what orders we had and what jobs I could do when Elizabeth tapped me on my shoulder.

“You seem to be in a hurry, dear,” she said. At first, I was startled and turned around quickly. I looked at her until I slowly realized who she was and what was happening. Elizabeth was an older woman, maybe in the late years of her 60s. She was the boss’s wife and acted as a stand-in manager. She was also behind many of the homemade recipes they baked into their dishes. Her curly, blonde-dyed hair bobbed as she smiled at me. I must have been looking at her like a deer in headlights.

“Are you alright, Tori?” she asked in a motherly voice.

“Yes… Yes, I’m fine,” I replied with a lie.

“You don’t look fine,” she said accusatively, but still caring.

“I… I can handle myself,” I lied again. She looked up at the clock.

“You know you were twenty minutes late, right?”

“I know. I’m sorry. I don’t have an excuse.” I did have one. It was more unbelievable than “My dog ate my homework.”

“What’s got you so worried? You ain’t worried about being late, are you?” I shook my head, looking down, too ashamed to look at her in her eyes. I needed to think of a lie, something to say.

“Danny is sick.”

“Your boy?”

“Yes, he got sick this morning.” The harsh words from my own mouth battered against me. Each lie felt like another weight added to my heart in the Judgement of Osiris. Elizabeth put her hand on my shoulder, making me jump and look up at her.

“Is he okay?” I froze again, not knowing how to reply.

“I... I think so.” She must have sensed that something was wrong with me and before I knew it, she had pulled me into her embrace. She wrapped her bony arms around my back and patted my shoulder with her palm. I felt the sudden urge to cry, but against all odds, I kept my emotions at bay. The contact and warmth from her made me forget about the child I left at home, whether he was Danny or a monster. The tension in my body lessened as I put my arms up around her too.

“Thank you,” I muttered.

“He’s going to be just fine, hon,” she said as she rubbed my back. She pulled away and looked at me again, this time with a smile.

“Now, how about we go cook?” she said. I breathed in deeply, shuddering for a moment before nodding my head and looking up at the ceiling to not let my tears fall. She grabbed my hand and let me further into the kitchen.

My day got a bit better in the meantime. I forgot about my worries and thought about cooking. I stayed in the back for most of the day, Elizabeth coming in to check on me every so often, knowing I wasn’t feeling well. Maybe she thought I was getting sick too. This shift flew by, my spirits getting up again, talking to my coworkers and making casual jokes. I felt good again. I finished up my shift and went to Elizabeth, thanking her once more before leaving. Her reply was something along the lines of “Anytime, dear.” I changed in the bathroom like usual, throwing my gas station uniform over my cook uniform. I was out the doors, in my car, down the road, and already working before I could think about anything else. Working was easy. It made me not think.

I met Tiff inside and started small talk with her. One of her kids had gotten arrested for possession of meth. It wasn’t surprising since she was a reoffender, but Tiff needed to tell me all about how she gave her the life to make good choices and go to college when she didn’t even graduate high school. I was happy that someone else was talking to me and keeping me occupied. For most of the day, I helped in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning where I could. I didn’t feel cheery enough to talk to customers about our new “buy one, get one free” deal today. Tiff happily obliged by taking that spot, ready to hear any new town gossip and to readily talk about her daughter’s screwup life.

As the night came to a close, Tiff brought me out again for an end-of-the-shift break. I went outside, the familiar green lights and humid air hitting me again. It was the first time I had actually looked at something without seeing everything as a blurry mess all day. It was the first time I had thought since that morning, and my first thought was that I was hungry. I hadn’t even taken a break all day. I hadn’t eaten all day, I was starving, but I wasn’t going to leave Tiff out there alone, so I stayed. I walked around the building and leaned against that familiar brick wall; she was already smoking at this point. She blew a big cloud out and turned to face me.

“So, what’s with you not wanting to be up front today? You usually always wanna be.” She had cut the head off of the snake, going straight to the root.

“I uhh… I’ve not been feeling well today,” I said. Not a total lie, but a vague answer.

“You sad or something? Or are you ‘sick sick’?”

“A bit of both,” I finally answered with a hint of honesty. She pushed off the wall and moved in front of me, putting the back of her hand against my forehead while her cigarette hung from the corner of her mouth.

“You got a fever or somethin’? You don’t feel hot.” My stomach growled.

“I… I haven’t eaten much today.” She moved her hand back and used it to take another puff on her cigarette, turning her head and blowing it in the opposite direction.

“When’d you eat last?” I couldn’t answer her; I was embarrassed. I looked down at my feet, ambiently staring at nothing. I started to shake, partially from fear and partially from energy loss. Tiff put her arm around me and held me up, leading me away from the wall.

“C’mon, girl, let me get you somethin’ to eat. I’ll pay for it an’ everything.”

“Please don’t,” I spoke softly, shaking.

“Nope. I’m watching you eat, and you ain’t goin’ home til you do.” I didn’t have any other choice. I had to. I knew I needed to, but I didn’t want to. I was so caught up in work, and I didn’t even feel hungry at the moment. That’s what I thought at least. I knew the real reason was because I had left my son at home to starve. I couldn’t eat without him, but I needed to. I wanted to stay strong for him, but I couldn’t. I gave in. Tiff went to the back and made me a sandwich, special for me. She brought it to my hands. It had tomato on it, which I hated, but I wasn’t one to oblige in that moment. I took a few bites, slowly chewing the food with a pit in my stomach that only grew as I ate. It didn’t taste good, it didn’t feel good, and I felt terrible for eating it… but I needed to. 

“So, why aren’t you eatin’?” Tiff asked with no regard or filter. I just looked up at her as I took my last bite. She watched me like a vulture waiting for an animal to die.

“I don’t know. I haven’t been feeling well, and…” I paused for a long time.

“Danny’s sick.” Her ears perked up again. She never changed.

“Aw, he’s sick? How’s the little guy doing?” I recited the same lines as before after that.

“He’ll be fine, I think.”

“I remember those times. He’ll get sick all the time, every other weekend. It’s the terrible twos.” For a second, my heart dropped. I thought she had caught onto me, that she was going to call me an abusive mom, and that I had been starving my son. Then I realized what she had said.

“He’s three. He’s three years old,” I said quickly, interrupting.

“I didn’t realize he was already three.” We sat there for a few seconds before she redirected the path of the conversation.

“So, is he getting you sick too? That why you can’t eat?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

“You ain’t pregnant, are you? Can’t imagine you having two kids right now.”

I wanted to cry at that comment. It hurt. I couldn’t have two kids in my state. It was impossible, and I was going to learn how hard it was. I solemnly shook my head “No.” She sat up from the small crate she was on, looking up at the clock and realizing it was a bit after my time to go. She patted me on the shoulder.

“Time to go, Tori.” She grabbed my hand and lifted me up.

“Thank you.” 

“No problem,” she smiled.

“Now get on home,” she said as she gave me a gentle push forward. I started walking out to the door.

“Drive safe… and tell Danny I say ‘Hi’ to him.”

I opened the doors and walked out without looking back. Everything returned to a blur and zoomed out as I got into my car and started driving down the road, keeping my arms perfectly stiff. I couldn’t think anymore. I just needed to get home and go to bed. I wanted to shut my mind off completely. I started the drive to Beth’s house with little memory of the drive. I only remember thinking one thing.

""My son is dead, isn't he?""

I hope this post is okay – if it’s not in line with the group rules, please feel free to delete it and no worries at all 🙏

I’m reaching out to any **property managers, building owners, or leasing teams** across the Midwest who are looking to add an awesome amenity or elevate their tenant experience.

I work with **The Coffee Ethic**, a specialty coffee roaster based in Springfield, MO. We offer **wholesale coffee solutions** that are perfect for office buildings, shared spaces, tenant lounges, or leasing office hospitality. Whether you’re outfitting a coffee bar in your lobby or just want to offer a better brew in the breakroom, we’ve got you covered.

We provide:

* **Ready-to-serve blends** for drip and batch brewers
* **Cold brew** options (great for summer setups!)
* **White-labeled coffee** (your branding, our beans)
* **Custom programs** to fit your setup and service style

Tenants notice the little things. A genuinely good cup of coffee in the morning can go a long way in showing you care – and it’s way more appreciated than another granola bar or bottle of water.

If you're based in Missouri or anywhere in the Midwest and want to explore a coffee upgrade, feel free to message me or drop a comment. I’d love to share some ideas or even send a sample your way.

Emma is really nice and sweet and we get along super easily as housemates and in general. I also like hanging out with Emma outside of our house friend group. We go on cute little coffee dates, study together in the library, etc.

The problem is, while I do love hanging out with Emma, she's also super clingy and is always crashing my plans with other friends when she knows about them. And she almost always knows, because she constantly asks what I've got going on.

I've talked to her about this, but every time she brushes it off with something like ""ou sorry I was just nearby and wanted to say hi and then someone asked me to stay"". She's not lying, someone always says ""you should join us!"" because it would be weird and rude not to, but she always accepts and the amount she shows up is getting kinda weird.

Last night I really wanted my space and time with other friends, so when she asked what I was doing later I told her I had a date with a guy from Tinder, even though really I was going to a bar with some girls from my course. 

When I got home I could hear her crying. I went to go check on her, and she told me she'd seen one of the other girls' insta stories with me at the bar and knew I'd been lying about the date to avoid her. I tried to explain I didn't mean to hurt her and just wanted more of my own life, but she just got more upset.

Today she hasn't talked to me at all and wasn't at our usual study spot in the library. I know I upset her and I honestly didn't mean or want to, but I don't know what else I could have done? I love hanging out with her, I just need friends and time of my own too. I don't know what to do because Emma never listens when I try to tell her I need some space

I hope this is okay to post here – if it’s not in line with group rules, feel free to delete and no hard feelings at all ❤️

Just wanted to drop a quick note for any cafés, bakeries, offices, or event spaces across the Midwest who are looking for a wholesale coffee partner (or even just exploring the idea). I work with **The Coffee Ethic**, a specialty roaster based in Springfield, MO, and we love helping folks serve really good coffee.

We offer:

* **Wholesale blends** (perfect for service, drip, cold brew, etc.)
* **Custom blends** (we can work with your team to craft something unique to your brand)
* **White labeling** (great if you're building your own coffee brand or need retail bags with your logo)
* **Green sourcing and project coffees** (if you're looking for something special or want to go deeper into origin stories)

We're a small but passionate crew and believe that great coffee starts with great relationships – so we’re always happy to chat, send samples, or just connect and swap ideas about coffee programs.

If you're based in Missouri or anywhere else in the Midwest and want to talk coffee, shoot me a message or drop a comment – I’d love to hear what you’re working on and see if we can support it!

However, the previous owner removed the 30A dryer breaker and installed a 100A breaker for a subpanel that was installed in the garage. The garage subpanel has four 20A breakers and one 60A. Only three 20A breakers are on powering outlets for a camera and small air compressor. The 60A goes to an empty box and is off (previous owner removed and took whatever was wired to it). My water heater, furnace, dryer and stove are all gas. Other small appliances include refrigerator, air fryer, microwave, small deep freezer, coffee maker, primo water cooler and 3D printer. Based on the NEC calculations I've used online, I'm anywhere between 55A - 71A. Some say I could use the 60A in the garage for an EV charger but it would put me on the high end. To be safe, I'm thinking of replacing it with a 30A resulting in 24A output which is sufficient for my daily driving needs.

Are there any issues with the 100A main panel feeding a 100A subpanel? Does that violate any codes? Is it safe to replace the 60A with a 30A in the subpanel for an EV charger or do I need to upgrade my main to 200A?",2,1749089097.0,AskElectricians,4,1.0,False

This is one of the simplest and most effective barriers you can create using items already in your home:

**You’ll need:**

* **Used coffee grounds**
* **Crushed eggshells** (powdered = best)
* **Salt**

🔹 **Used coffee grounds** are ideal for building a **protective boundary outside**—around your home, car, or investigation site.  
🔹 **Fresh or unused coffee grounds** work **inside** to absorb and remove lingering energy.  
🔹 Mix with salt and powdered eggshells (cascarilla) and sprinkle the blend in the **four corners of each room** or around gear you want to spiritually shield.

**Why it's important for investigators:**

When you enter haunted or spiritually active locations, you're stepping into unknown energetic territory. Spirits can latch on, follow you home, or disrupt your environment if you’re not careful. This blend helps:

* **Block spiritual hitchhikers**
* **Seal off portals or open energy spots**
* **Clear residual energy from equipment or clothing**
* **Restore your home base to neutral**

Many of us use sage, sprays, or crystals—but this mix is a grounding tool that works well in urban environments or when fire/smoke isn’t an option.

If you’re in places like Miami, where the energy runs deep and the stories are layered, tools like this are essential.

Anyone else using similar field protection? What’s in your kit?

1l3niwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l3niwl/best_way_to_deal_with_annoying_coworkers/,Best way to deal with annoying coworkers?,"Genuinely need some advice

  
Today was my 3rd day as a Summer Analyst in Banking, and while the bank & team is extremely chill, I have some fellow Junior coworkers who are genuine social vampires. I honestly feel bad complaining here, but I don't want to sound like some downer to my friends in real life.

To be clear, I enjoy working in an office environment and networking with new people, but there's a limit. Today, for example I was building a tedious report regarding 30+ clients and had to fish for a bunch of data in our systems. The problem is, I was constantly interrupted by loud, never-ending conversations, which I am randomly being dragged into. Every 10 minutes, a coworker would ask how everything was going, even though it's a longer, week-long project. They simply talk for the sake of talking.

They're also walking around half the time, so every 5 minutes one of them will pass my screen and start a conversation about the most boring shit they see on it. I'll have an employee training open, or literally a pdf about some random client firm I need to check, and even that will turn into a filler conversation. 

Because I'm a summer analyst/intern, they always drop unsolicited advice as well. The report I was working on was already largely formatted by a Director, who told me upfront to just get the key financial figures and we would discuss the formatting/edits together later. Yet, these junior coworkers crowded around my computer and had to give their input. ""You should format it like this"", ""no like that"". Or discussing ""the intern"" amongst themselves within my earshot range. It's never mean-spirited, but it feels like some frat. The senior bankers do their own thing and, surprisingly, don't seem annoyed by the chatting, even if it replaces real work. Plus it's not like I'm gonna go and complain like a child, let alone on my 4th day.

Basically, there is hardly ever just one minute of silence and it's extremely frustrating. We already go out for team lunches and coffee throughout the day. Everyone, including me, talks and laughs, so you would think that would be enough to leave the in-office hours to work -- but no. The whole work day is like a therapy session for them, even when others are trying to get actual projects done in peace. One analyst is particularly annoying -- he simply can never stop talking, and it's almost painful. He talks about concerts, bars, people from other departments, party plans, bla bla bla. The kind of small/personal talk most people would save for office happy hour, not 2 pm on a Wednesday. Anything on his mind, he'll start discussing. 

Clearly, I'm not the only one, as I saw some dude from another team (neighboring seating area) collapse his face into his palms and start massaging his forehead after said analyst walked over near his spot and started yet another conversation with someone from our team.

I really feel bad venting about it, as I'd much rather have this over some silent suitcases judging my every move, but I come home frustrated and socially depleted. At my old office, we had a small team with a perfect work/chatting balance, so getting team drinks was an absolute treat. But here I am legitimately being drained. I can't do my fucking job in this environment and I am already missing my old small-team dynamic.",1,1749088822.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I've been watching the recordings of Laura's lives today. I didn't think it was appropriate to screen record or even do an actual transcript, but I talked to our mod about sharing in my own words what she explained about some of the events, so here we go.

THE KIDNAPPING:  
The day she got the RO, Stephen had been texting her and calling non-stop since early morning. He then showed up at the house and was standing outside screaming for Alfie and Poppy and demanding she bring him ""his boy."" She told him she was going to call the police if he didn’t leave, and he said he was “prepared for a fight.” She did actually end up calling the police, and when she told him they were on the way, he sped away (in his new Porsche - which she mentioned at one point ""why if you finally got some money would you not put that toward your children instead of buying a fucking Porsche?"") When the police arrived, they basically said they couldn’t do anything since she had no RO and no formal custody agreement. Plus he was already gone at that point.

That’s when she knew she had to get an RO. While she was at the courthouse getting it, her nanny called and said Stephen was outside again. She could hear him screaming ALFIE at the top of his lungs, but she couldn’t see him. Laura told her to keep the doors locked, and if he tried to get inside, call the police. At some point, the kids opened the door and ran out to the gate because they heard him. The nanny ran out behind them. She called Laura again, and she said to let him see them in the driveway, but do NOT let him in the house. She didn’t want to yank the kids away from their dad given they have no understanding of what’s going on, and she was afraid what would happen if the nanny tried. Stephen suddenly looked at his phone and told the nanny “oh, Laura just texted me I can take the kids.” The nanny told him Laura hadn’t said anything to her, and he basically kept saying, “well she did” and was loading them up in the car and speeding away before the nanny could do anything. Laura was FREAKING OUT. She called the cops again and said her ex had kidnapped her kids. Stephen was sending her videos and pictures of the kids in the car with no seatbelts or booster seats. Again, they can’t do anything because there’s no formal custody order in place, and he was already back at his house right down the street at that point. The texts he keeps posting where he says ""Laura SAID it was okay for them to spend the night and the nanny can pick them up in the morning"" – Laura said she had confirmed they were at his house down the street at that point, and she felt rocking the boat wasn’t a good idea. She knew he was going to demand they spend the night, and rather than whip him into a frenzy with the kids there, she just went with it from the start. She suggested the nanny picking them up because she knew if HE brought them back, he would push his way into the house, “overstay” as she put it and then start a fight. Once she got them back safe, she was able to get the RO served so there was no chance of this ever happening again. She is DONE done. She mentioned how it wasn’t just people on the internet telling her to put up some fucking boundaries. Her inner circle was, too. But she thought keeping the peace and trying to create a friendship and decent co-parenting relationship was the right thing to do. She’s kicking herself for it now more than anyone else could, but she has reached the breaking point. He can scream into the void to try to get her attention all he wants, but she’s had it.

THE ""SATANIC CON-ARTIST"" PARENTS  
Laura said Stephen's paranoia REALLY got bad when his parents were in town. She had invited some of Poppy and Alfie's friends to Alfie's birthday party and some dads came with their kids. Dads that Stephen had NEVER met until that day. He was convinced one of the dads was scamming her, trying to ""get"" her. A couple of days later, Laura ran into the mom at a coffee shop. She told Stephen about it and that they'd had a nice chat. He freaked out and told Laura she needed to check her car for a tracker. He said there was no way it was a coincidence she ran into her, the family was ""evil"" and she had to check her car for a tracker. YIKES.

LAURA WANTING TO RESPOND BUT WON'T  
Laura said it's been reiterated to her NOT to engage. Even if she wishes she could defend herself. He has told her she's nothing without him, nobody cares about her content unless he's in it, her podcast is going to fail without him involved, ""you can't afford your life"" unless you make videos with me. She told him she'd turned her book into the publisher, and he said, ""who's going to buy it?"" It baffles her because she wants nothing more than for him to have a fulfilling, clean, happy life. She'd never say anything like that to him.

The co-parenting sketches she wrote about him - HE suggested them and even helped her write them. He thought they'd be funny, but now he's acting like she did it to hurt him.

Every time she saw him before the RO, they would start out having a pleasant conversation, and she would get tricked into opening up to him. Then the next day, it's all over the internet - every detail. She would tell him specifically it was things between the two of them, but she hadn't yet understood ""believe the pattern, not the person.""

She said he'd been using for a lot longer than she ever realized. She knew she was probably purposely not seeing it. Stephen admitted he'd been using since Poppy was a newborn. She just thought he had become uncaring, abusive and unsafe but didn't understand why. It makes sense now.

SO - Laura is treading water for her life and trying to do everything she can to support her kids, pay the mortgage and protect herself and her kids. (OH, and she did indeed confirm she was paying his mortgage and ""hired"" him to do podcasts with her in an attempt to help him get back on his feet. She didn't say if she was going to stop paying the mortgage on the old place, but I hope that's on the table!!)

And for those who think she's doing this for views - I am the first person to be a skeptic of everyone's motives until they prove me otherwise. And she did. If you see her face, the dark circles under her eyes, how she's taking deep breaths and trying to calm her anxiety, the yawning from no sleep, along with the tears (REAL) when someone says she's doing the right thing - I know she's an actress, but I've felt those emotions about my ex, and I can just FEEL what she's feeling. It's not fake. And she's scared.",81,1749088765.0,StephenHiltonSnark,36,1.0,False

With CrumchyKarlGamez' next livestream scheduled in just a couple minutes, I navigated my way through our favourite channels and clicked on the link. “Just in time!” Matt said, sliding into the room with a plate of snacks. He placed it on the coffee table, sat down, and reached for a cookie, only to find the plate about two-thirds empty. “...Really? Come on, it hasn't even started yet!” The three venlil in the room all had handfuls of sweets and nonplussed expressions. It wasn't *our* fault he knew how to cook.

The countdown ended, and we were greeted with the channel intro, but instead of Carl fading in at the end, we were greeted by what appeared to be an arxur wearing shades, headphones, and a backwards baseball cap. It looked to the camera, then to something off screen before taking a nervous breath and addressing the camera. “Hello, and welcome to the channel of CrumchyKarlGamez…” The arxur looked off screen again and muttered something I couldn't make out beyond a “please?” Near the end.

“You're doing fine, man. Come on, you have a script. You can do this.” The unmistakable voice of Sarah came from just out of frame, using a tone reminiscent of my mom when she was waiting for me to stop whining about a very easy task and just do it already. The arxur took it in a similar manner to myself, cringing and looking down awkwardly, before facing the inevitable.

Taking a *very* shaky breath, the reptilian raised a page and started reading. “...Welcome all sentient life, artificial intelligences, and cosmic entities beyond mortal understanding, to the channel. My name is Zyrith, and the odds of me being… a *dossur*, piloting a miniature arxur ‘Gundam’... Are a safe bet…” The dossur let out a pained sigh and lowered the page. This time he properly addressed the camera, no script needed. “By way of apology for what happened on the last stream, I am filling in for Carl for today's episode while he is in prison for the theft of the Cerebral Accorder seen on the last video. Rest assured he will return in time for the next episode, but was unable to make it today.”

“*What!?” Delva shot right up to her feet at the news, and the rest of us damn near joined her. “Did any of you hear about that? Any idea what's happening!?” Her questions were met with tail flicks and a shaking head, all indicating we hadn't. Zyrith began to move the video along, but completely missing the chat's attempts to circle back to the issue.

“There is no need to worry however, Carl has left a contingency in place for such an event, and has set up everything I should need to complete today's stream. There should be a terran game for me to play, so I believe that would make this episode ‘an arx-” The higher pitch of a terran woman's *”ahem!”* Interrupted Zyrith. “A *hypothetical* arxur reacts.” The Gundam slumped a bit further. “I have not played games since I was a youth, and of those, none were video games. I am not sure how to… interact with anything going on. I ask for your patience.”

“We're really just gonna move along from that, huh? Anyone wanna see if they can find anything on that?” My paw was slapped away from the cookie platter moments before securing another prize. Matt’s watchful gaze was unwavering in my attempts to distract him, further attempts would doubtlessly be equally fruitless. Returning my attention to the screen, Zyrith was attempting to navigate the multiple displays that were standard for most streamers. Poor guy had managed to replace the screen recording with the camera, showing us a repeating image of his own head in smaller and smaller boxes.

Sarah took pity on him, and sorted out the situation better than the Chat's attempts to instruct him ever could, and we were greeted with Carl's desktop. The background was a poorly drawn picture of a pair of shocked looking terrans pointing at something behind them, though whatever it was had been covered by a game icon labeled ‘THIS ONE ZYRITH’. Dozens of other icons had been shunted to the sides, all labeled ‘NOT THIS ONE’, ‘DON’T PICK ME’, or other such variations. Zyrith, clearly having *some* experience with terran tech, double clicked the central icon after muttering his thanks to Sarah.

“...Alright, let the games begin, I believe is the expression.” The dossur’s Gundam said as the screen loaded in. The entire screen went dark as the game loaded in, before a simple tune started playing, accompanied by text and pixilated images drawn in various shades of yellow. We were treated with a story of a war between humans and monsters, that ended with the monsters being defeated and sealed under a mountain. “So they conquered other species and locked them up? These must be the humans the kolshians saw.” The dossur attempted a joke, but was clearly still unfamiliar with the persona needed to be a proper streamer. I gave him points for effort though.

The story continued, now depicting a human child climbing the mountain and falling into a pit found in a cave, though the somber tone the game was trying to convey was immediately cut off, as what had to be a mod replaced the original art with cartoon version of the child taking the gnarliest fall I'd ever seen. “Hahaha!” Zyrith bellowed. “Predator or prey, you have to admit that was hilarious!” Personally, I don't think I have to admit to *anything*, even if he's right. The game reverted to its original style as abruptly as before, with the child now at the bottom of the pit. 

The camera panned up to show just how far they fell, and more importantly, pillars that had been carved from stone. “Ooooh! They've found the monsters!” Delva said, and I flicked my ears in agreement. It was at this point the game finally introduced itself. UNDERTALE appeared in massive letters across the screen.

“Hey Matt, you heard of this game before?” I asked.

“Can't say I have,” He replied, quickly scrolling through his holopad. “Though in my defense, in an indie game from over a century ago, according to this.”

“Oh, put that down! Can't you just watch one screen at a time!?” Mom said, ordering the human.

Back to the stream, Zyrith had been tasked with naming the fallen child. Of course, the chat was filled with suggestions, but one was significantly more common than the others. Someone even made a donation, and a synthesized text-to-speech voice said he should name them ‘Chara’. Seeing no reason to refuse, Zyrith did so. The game seemed to approve, simply stating ‘the true name’ in response.

“So, I occupy the role of a human child, one so foolish and clumsy as to climb this mountain alone and fall into a giant pit. I do not like the idea of being such a small, weak creature. Eer, which is why I would use a Gundam, you see.” Zyrith said as he began moving around.

“That makes so much *sense!*” Matt said, nodding sagely. I agreed, and it actually gave me an idea. I grabbed my holopad, much to Mom’s annoyance, and began typing.

With a donation made, my message was read aloud. “We should start a fundraiser! Make sure *every* dossur on earth is driving one!” I chuckled to myself as the chat exploded with the idea.

Zyrith seemed shocked at that, and sat still as if he had no idea how to react. *’no idea why, though.’* He got an awkward thank you out, and continued the game.

“...I don't think I trust you.” Was the first thing Zyrith said to the talking flower. ‘Flowey’, as it called itself, had taken the responsibility of teaching Chara how the world of monsters worked. A new screen appeared, replacing the cave they were in with a combat screen, having several buttons, a close up of Flowey, and a heart in a large box Zyrith could move. Flowey began throwing ‘friendliness pellets’ at the ‘soul’, and told Chara to catch them. Zyrith dodged, and Flowey clearly didn't like that. He even started getting angry when Zyrith did it again.

“Ahh! I saw that! You called them bullets! You deceitful little weed! How do I counterattack?” Zyrith said. Flowey, realizing his slip, edited his speech bubble to say friendliness pellets again, but it was too late. With the facade ended, Flowey accused Chara of wanting to see him suffer. The next attack had him surrounded with a solid ring of bullets, slowly closing in. “This isn't fair! Why can't I-” Zyrith was cut off as the bullets disappeared and another projectile struck Flowey, sending the flower flying. “I don't think I did that.” The dossur said.

Sure enough, another figure appeared, introducing herself as Toriel, caretaker of the ruins. The game progressed following her lead as she guided Zyrith through a simple scene of purple halls with minimal detail, hinting at the game's age. *’probably a first generation console game'*. There were a few puzzles based on pressure plates that were required to open the way forward, but they were a) incredibly simple and b) marked with the answer, assumedly by Toriel. “I mean really, I understand humans are more nurturing toward their young than a…lot of species, but this is just silly!” The dossur complained as they ‘fought’ a dummy by talking to it. I couldn't help but agree. After seeing Carl playing other terran games, this seemed really heavy handed.

Of course, that all changed when Toriel asked them to walk down a hall… alone! The dramatic music really sold the high stakes, and was so engaging, that Zyrith began taking questions from the chat. “Ahh, I see that… I cannot pronounce that name… but one of you is asking about how I came to live on Earth. I cannot go into details as many specifics are classified, but I can say I met Carl during the raid on the Cradle and ended up getting off planet on a human shuttle… I had nowhere to go, so Carl ‘stole’ me, in his own words.”

“*Kidnapping a dossur!?* Guys, we need to cancel Carl!” Matt joked. Fortunately the hall ended before we were subjected to more of the human's terrible humor. Just in front of the door, Toriel came out from behind a pillar, and explained she needed to test Zyrith's independence before she left. She instructed him not to leave the room until she returned, so the first thing Zyrith did was leave the room.

*Ring!* “Fu[BEEP]!” Freedom from the overbearing lady was snatched away as the phone she gave Chara rang as soon as he left the room, and she confirmed he'd not left. It was not something Zyrith appreciated. But she could do little else than call, and soon they were free to go where they pleased. The Gundam wielding dossur began exploring, talking to a froggit, saving their game, and finding a bowl of candy. Zyrith's sweet tooth shone through as the mention of candy had him take everything until he knocked the bowl over, prompting the game to shame him with a “look at what you've done” message.

Zyrith didn't care though. He simply asked the chat how to eat his candy. After a brief explanation he had a basic understanding of how the menu worked and elected not to eat the candy yet as it was the only healing he had. He'd also began to explore the other aspects of the menu and found his phone, and, after being convinced to by the malevolent force that is a gaming channel's chat, called Toriel and asked to call her mom.

If that were the end of it that would have been fine. Toriel was clearly acting like a mom, and clearly liked the idea very much. But then, there was the *other* option. “Why would I do that?” Zyrith asked. “That's just silly, why are you so insistent?” But his objections were overwhelmed. Succumbing to peer pressure, Zyrith got out the phone, and hit the Flirt option. The first time Toriel took it as a joke. The second time…

“WHY WOULD YOU MAKE ME DO THIS!?” Zyrith roared, incredulous. “And specifically *after* calling her ‘mother’! You planned it this way, you sickening, leaf-licking primates!” The whole couch whistling with laughter. Of course they did! These were the same humans who made the game take that particular tidbit into account in the first place! 

As the laughter died down, a new sound caught my ear, specifically the ringing of a holopad. Mom quickly realized it was hers, and more notably, the caller was Matt, sitting just across the room. The answered, staring the human down. “Yes, Matt?” She asked with a note of suspicion.

**“Hey sugar baby how you doin’?”** The words came doubled, first from the human's mouth in a far deeper tone than usual, then again, translated from the phone.

“Delva? Please kick him.”

“Hey that's not- Ow! Come on I was jok- OW!”

“You'd think he'd learn one of these days.” In so saying, mom ended the call.

“...wait…” I said, as the gears started clicking into place. My eyes scanned the chat log, and found the term ‘goat mom' appearing multiple times. ‘Goat’ was the animal humans said *we* looked like. The low resolution graphics made it hard to tell, along with humanity's tendency to put predator eyes on everything, but Toriel appeared to have white fur, and paws rather than feet. “Matt?” I asked.

“What!?” He responded tersely, still trying to fend off my sister. My answer was to add a few kicks of my own.

With the predator in our midst vanquished, Zyrith had our attention again. The nice, wholesome herbivore in a mech was cutting down monsters as they progressed through the ruins. At first they were willing to spare any monsters whose names turned yellow, but after their LOVE increased, the idea of getting stronger appealed to him. Time passed with the occasional battle while puzzles were solved. Only a few monsters were spared and it was usually the cowardly ones.

Eventually Zyrith entered a room, with the only path being blocked by some kind of white blob lying on the ground. “A ghost? How am I being blocked by something with no physical form?” Zyrith asked as he engaged Napstablook in a battle. “Perhaps it would have been rude to walk through them? How could a precedent for that be formed? It must be- **are you CRYING on me!?**”

Napstablook was in fact crying on him, probably in response to Zyrith's attack if I had to guess. Instead of the saline tears that ran down one's face however, whatever came out the ghost's eyes launched themselves at Zyrith's soul, dealing damage as they came into contact. “Well, I think we can take this as proof that humans do in fact view emotions as weakness. This creature won't stop crying, and I need to slay it! Quite a thinly veiled metaphor if you ask me!” Despite the dossur's boisterous words, the attacks began overwhelming him, and forced him to heal.

Zyrith struck again, and Napstablooks' turn came, prompting the ghost not to attack, but to apologize for not being up to fighting instead. Zyrith found himself taken aback at the concept of an enemy who was so down, they couldn't even be bothered to fight back. Instead of pouncing on the moment of weakness, Zyrith actually checked his act menu, which I think just proves that ‘arxur’ look is indeed just an aesthetic choice for a mech. Only a prey race would show such mercy! Though, he didn't seem to like his other choices much better. “Oh no! No no no! We are not doing this again!” Zyrith yelled, looking right at the object of his ire; a ‘flirt’ option. “If that is necessary to spare you, I'm just not. You understand that?” He asked the screen.

The chat, being the chat, took this as a personal challenge, and began doing everything in their power to get Zyrith to flirt with the ghost he'd just been attacking. A flood of messages and even a few donations came in, but he ignored them all, choosing to compliment Napstablook instead. The strategy worked, and in a few turns the battle ended. Back in the overworld, the ghost said he was happy to meet someone nice before disappearing.

“So it does not matter how the battle goes, only how it ends? Does that work in real life too?” Zyrith turned to the camera. “Everyone, attack a friend, compliment them, and end the conversation. For science.” 

I whirled around and punched Matt in the arm, eliciting a squawk of protest from the human, who tried to retaliate. “I love your baking!” I shouted, scootching out of reach.

“Furry fucking bastard.” He said, shaking his head.

“Herr, don't actually do that, it was just a joke.” The dossur said far, far too late. Evidently I wasn't the only one who heeded his command as the chat began filling with messages about the results people had on their experiments. Zyrith's eyes widened at the realization of how much violence happened at his command, though I couldn't tell if it was a look of horror or excitement from behind those ridiculous shades. “Uh… this channel does not accept any liability for damages of actions people took of their own volition. I ask you do not get Carl's account suspended.” He spoke into the mike.

Exploration of the ruins continued as Zyrith began conversing with the chat about the data gained from the experiment as he plowed through the simple puzzles of the game. It seemed the general consensus was that you *could* attack someone and avoid any major consequences with a few kind words, though there were some exceptions. However, the majority of the data came from friends and family, and further experimentation would be needed for acquaintances, strangers and other groups of people. Hypothetically, of course. He passed the final puzzle mid conversation, without even slowing despite me actually needing to give it some thought. The dossur really seemed to have a knack for these kinds of things.

Zyrith entered the next room, which was just as purple as the rest, though this one was decorated with a dead, black tree. Which made sense to me, they were underground and in a brick building, those aren't optimal tree conditions. A few steps in and Toriel reappeared, seeming to regret disappearing for so long before seeing Zyrith’s character and fussing over his wounds. 

The dossur was oddly silent as she invited him into her house and showed him around. The first room they showed was stated to be Zyrith’s and he was left to get some rest. Staring intently at the screen, he slowly made his way around the room. A toy chest sat at the foot of the bed, a closet held an assortment of clothes, and after turning off the lamp, he went to sleep in a luxuriously sized bed all to the tune of calm, relaxing music. When they next awoke, something had been left on the floor, presumedly by Toriel. Picking it up revealed it to be a Butterscotch-Cinnamon pie. “Pie… I never got to try any pie…” Zyrith’s voice was distant, almost hollow, as he just, stood there for a moment.

Zyrith continued silently as he entered the left side of the building. Toriel was resting in a chair next to a fireplace, one that had been enchanted not to burn, but produce a pleasant warmth along with its glow. Toriel expressed her appreciation for their company when spoken to, and offered a ‘snail fact’, stating whatever a snail was spoke slowly. I grabbed my holopad as Zyrith explored and checked the earth datadump for what slails even were. “I've come to the conclusion that Toriel’s a weirdo.” I said, seeing the limbless mollusks she seemed so fascinated with.

I read a bit of an article on the creatures before returning my attention to the stream. Zyrith had used the time to check the rest of the house and, upon being barred from the basement, stepped outside and checked the one route he'd yet to explore. However, the path ended quickly, with only a toy knife to be found. “Matthew, are you knives… normal for human children?” Mom asked. Right, I suppose that was kinda weird.

“...Well… kinda…?” Mom gave him a flat look. “Ok, ok! Yes, toy weapons are absolutely a thing and you're actually more likely to see a toy gun or sword than just a knife.” The human relented.

“You predators and your infatuation with violence.” Delva said with a dramatic scoff. 

“Y'all literally *just* kicked me over a joke!” Matt defended. “I'm gonna bring in toy swords one day, and you're **all** gonna like’em! Mark my words!” Ok sure buddy.

Back to the game, Toriel had insisted Zyrith stay with her, but left with no other course of action, the dossur pressed her on how to leave the ruins, causing her to run off, saying she had to do something. Zyrith followed her to the basement, and after pushing forth, they came to a room with a large door. This was the only way to leave the ruins. Beyond this door, Toriel warned them of the monsters beyond, that they, Asgore, would kill them. To prevent this, Toriel intended to destroy the door, and ordered Zyrith to return upstairs. Zyrith hesitated for long moments, but still insisted, refusing to be trapped. Seeing his will, Toriel demanded proof of his strength, proof that he could survive. A battle began.

A new song began as we faced Toriel, a strange tune that tried to project strength, but somehow came off as almost mournful instead. “Wait, fight? I don't want- Toriel, stop!” Of course, the computer program was deaf to Zyrith's protests, just as Toriel was to Chara’s. For the first time since the dummy, Zyrith started the battle with the Act menu, and tried talking to Toriel. The only response was Toriel's continued attack and a message that, ironically, talking didn't seem to be the way through this fight. Storms of fire flew at Chara's soul, quickly wearing down their health in spite of Zyrith's clumsy attempts to dodge. 

With talking proving a bust, Zyrith struck out with the toy blade and purposely landed a weak hit. His eyes lit up at seeing how little damage was done. “That's right, you seek to guide me. Now I must prove myself as more than a hatchling. I just need to prove myself in a sparring match. I will succeed!” He said.

Despite his bluster, Zyrith's healing supplies quickly ran out while Toriel's health bar fell oh so slowly. He stuck it out though, continuing the fight instead of running even as his health dropped to the single digits. Then something changed. As Zyrith's health dropped to a mere 2, Toriel's attacks changed, her fiery attacks now avoided Zyrith, unwilling to hurt him further. “Have I not failed? I am at your mercy. Why draw this out?” He asked. He tried talking again, but there was still no effect. The music took on a sad, or even resigned demeanor as we watched Zyrith slowly cut down his own guardian who refused to fight back.

“Her health is getting low, only capable of taking a few more strikes. She should concede soon.” As Zyrith spoke, his next attack hit far harder, instantly forcing Toriel to her knees. Large gashes appeared in her sprite. Zyrith had briefly appeared excited at victory, but now concern filled his eyes. “No. Wait…” but it was too late.

Even on death's door, Toriel did not stop looking out for Zyrith. Struggling to breathe, she warned them of the dangers beyond, of an ‘Asgore’, who intended to steal his soul, for a plan that could not be allowed to come to pass. “Be good, won't you? My… Child…” Toriel's body faded to dust, just as the rest of Zyrith's victims. But unlike the others, a soul appeared in her place. It quickly cracked, and shattered into pieces. With no further fanfare, the battle screen faded away, returning to the image of Chara, standing in a now empty room.

“M-... Toriel…” Zyrith's voice was weak, barely audible by venlil standards, I imagine Matt didn't hear it at all. For nearly a minute, Zyrith looked between the camera, the chat and the game, though Chara went unmoved. 

“Why would humans make this!? It's supposed to be a game!” Delva half shouted, no longer able to withstand the naked emotions on Zyrith's face.

Matt, utterly oblivious to what everyone was feeling, responded with a barking laugh. “Because it's art! Art is there to evoke emotions, even uncomfortable ones. It'd never evolve beyond silly bits of fun otherwise!” My first impulse was to kick him again, but then I saw the wisdom in his words. Art was made to explore exactly this.

“No.” Zyrith finally broke his own silent spell. “No. No. Nope. Mm-mm. This isn't happening.” He quit out of the game after he found the right button. I thought he was done, but he opened it up again, and loaded his save. Appearing just outside Toriel's house, Zyrith ran back in, spoke to Toriel and sent them back down to the door. Just before the fight restarted, Toriel seemed confused about the look on Chara’s face, saying they looked as if they'd seen a ghost. Was that line there last time?

The fight began again, and Zyrith returned to his act screen, completely refusing to touch the fight button this time. With only CHECK and TALK, he continued talking despite how it went last time. Another new line appeared, contemplating if Zyrith could show mercy without running or fighting. After a moment of pondering, they went to their 4th menu, labeled Mercy. Flee wasn't an acceptable option, but what could sparing do if their name wasn't yellow? 

A speech bubble appeared by Toriel, though she didn't say anything.

“Yes! That was different!” Zyrith roared, and spared again. Toriel continued to react, slowly voicing her confusion and demanding Zyrith fight, but he refused. Slowly but surely, he wore her down until all at once, the music cut off. Toriel, with all the fight take out of her, began to beg Zyrith to return upstairs, offering to take care of him, and promising a good life. “The option to flee is no longer even there? Perhaps that is for the best.” He said, pausing for a brief moment. 

Soon after, Toriel seemed to accept this outcome was best, as the ruins were no place for a child to grow. Her expectations, her loneliness, her fear, she would set them aside for Zyrith. 

Music began again as the battle ended, though this was the song we'd known from Toriel before the fight. Now a calm, kind, protective song that sang of a mother's love. She knelt down, gave Chara a hug, and, taking one last look at them, left the room.

A noise came from Zyrith, that wasn't exactly words. It took him a few moments to form those. “She’s- I-...Why?... Toriel!” His maw clamped shut as he lost faith in his ability to form coherent thoughts, and expressed himself instead by shaking his head in a very human expression. Sarah approached, asking if he was alright, but he waved her off. With a slow and steady breath, he found his voice again. “I am… sorry for that display… This is just a game, but the moment struck a personal chord with me. I am ready to continue.”

Zyrith approached the now unguarded door and passed through. The way was completely smothered in darkness with exactly one exception; Flowey.

“Clever. Verrrryyy clever.
You think you're really smart, don't you?
In this world, it's kill or be killed.” 

Zyrith straightened a bit at that. “I have proven you *wrong*, weed.” A bit of defiance in his voice.

“So you were able to play by your own rules.
You spared the life of a single person.”

Flowey’s words seemed to bring light to just how little his efforts accomplished. One life spared compared to what he'd already done. Zyrith deflated just slightly at the thought.

“Hee hee hee...
Froggit, Whimsun. Vegetoid, Loox. Migosp, Moldsmal.
Think about those names.
Do you think any of those monsters have families?
Do you think any of them have friends?
Each one could have been someone else's Toriel.
Selfish brat.”

That one clearly hit Zyrith hard. Mech or no, I never thought I'd so clearly recognize the pain of regret on the features of an arxur, yet there it was. His eyes were dry, yet I could still see the tears.


“Somebody is dead because of you. But don't act so cocky.
I know what you did.
You murdered her.”

“Wha-? But he-?” Delva voiced the shock we were all feeling. Zyrith quit the game! How did he know!?

“And then you went back, because you regretted it.
Ha ha ha ha...
You naive idiot.
Do you think you are the only one with that power?
The power to reshape the world...
Purely by your own determination.
The ability to play God!
The ability to ""SAVE.""
I thought I was the only one with that power. But...
I can't SAVE anymore.
Apparently YOUR desires for this world override MINE.
Well well.
Enjoy that power while you can.
I'll be watching.”

And with that, the flower left.

“Why you- Leaf licking… LEAF! Literally just a weed! You worthless little…!” Zyrith's furious gaze locked into the camera, the perfect picture of terror, even just a year ago. “Venlil! I know there's a lot of you that watch this channel! I want that efflorescence emulsified! Get-!”

“WELP That's all the time we have for today, folks!” Sarah appeared on camera again.

“What!? No!” Zyrith protested. But Sarah was having none of it. A single arm wrapped itself around the Gundam’s neck and secured him in a headlock, squoze tight enough to make the eyes bulge, and pulled him right out of his chair. “I… Flowey!” He gurgled.

“Thank you all so much for tuning in! As Zyrith said we should be back to the regular show by next episode! Be sure to tell Carl you missed him!”

Zyrith took a few swipes at the terran’s arm, but she didn't seem to even notice. “No! No!” He reached for the controller again, but was effortlessly yanked away.

“I hope to see your lovely faces again! ‘Till next time!” A moment later Sarah ended the stream, and the outro commenced while the chat erupted with everyone giving their goodbyes.

“...I think we should revisit the 'no terran games in the house's rule."" Delva said, like a fool. One look at mom was all the warning I needed to cover my ears and start running.

1l3nh6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1l3nh6c/creatine_mixed_into_warmhot_beverages/,Creatine mixed into warm/hot beverages.,"Hi. I keep trying to research this and am getting conflicting info online and thought a chemist could maybe help. 

My creatine powder doesn’t dissolve well in cold water, so it’s not working well to mix it in with my electrolyte drinks (made with filtered refrigerator water). 

Drinking room temperature creatine laced water sounds gross, so my next thought was to mix it in with my latte in the morning. 

I’ve read that creatine monohydrate is less stable mixed with water and can denature over time at higher temperatures (quicker when mixed in a solution) which is essentially what mixing it in with coffee or a latte would be. However I’m also reading that it is reasonably stable at least for a period of time. 

Can someone explain if my creatine will still be effective for me if I mix it with my latte? lol thanks ",1,1749088680.0,chemistry,8,1.0,False

She agreed to all. Ended up being filthy, crossing every boundary, hating my dog and leaving the apartment a disgusting mess for me to clean when she moved out.



**This is going to be a VERY LONG story, but I think it's worth it.**

Back in 2019 I (20F, at the time) was in the military and was finally able to move out of the barracks and into town. I had met a girl (21F, at the time) in the smokepit that was moving out around the same time as me and she seemed cool enough, so we decided we would just move in together. We weren't close by any means but I had talked to her on a few occasions and hadn't heard anything bad so I figured it would all be okay. I let her know that my dog was coming up from home and that he WAS a big dog (75lbs at a year old and still growing), but he wouldn't be coming up until that summer because that's when I would be taking leave. She said that was totally fine as long as he was potty trained and not aggressive. The only ground rules I had was keep the common areas clean and let me know when you're going to have friends over. I didn't care what her room looked like, I didn't care if she had friends over, parties, whatever.. just communicate with me. She said okay. Now, this seemed like a dream come true. I was FINALLY getting out of the moldy ass barracks AND I had a roommate who would clean up after herself and didn't mind my pup!  
**\*\*Spoiler alert:** none of the above was true LOL\*\*\*\*\*\*

For the sake of this story, We'll call her ""B"".

Fast forward to us moving in. Everything is good for the first few months. Some of her stuff laying around here and there but it wasn't a big deal. Then B got *comfortable*. Since we were both in the military, we worked shift work. Often times our schedules were opposite (I was on days, she was on nights and vise versa.) So we were both home alone a lot. It got to the point where I was coming home from a 12hr shift and having to clean. She would cook food and leave the pots/pans on the stove. POTS AND PANS... ON THE STOVE. She would make tea with my kettle and then leave the FULL cup of mint tea on the counter for DAYS and old water in the kettle. I STILL can't stand the smell of mint tea TO THIS DAY because it makes me fucking nauseous. She cut up fruit (I think it was Dragon Fruit) once and left the remnants on the cutting board, by the time I got home the BRIGHT PINK JUICE STAINED THE COUNTER AND MY CUTTING BOARD! McDonalds bags/wrappers/balled up napkins left on the coffee table. At this point, now I'm annoyed. I talked to her about keeping things clean and asked her VERY nicely to please not leave her dishes on the stove and trash out. She said okay and things started to look better. I was SO relieved, I shouldn't have to tell a grown woman to clean up after herself but hey! a wins a win. **UNTIL IT STARTED HAPPENING AGAIN.**

One day I came home on break to go on a jog around the park by my apartment. I walk in and see her laying on the couch, McDonalds bags in front of her, watching My Hero Academia. This wouldn't irk me usually but I had asked her that morning to please do the dishes (majority were hers and I literally do them EVERY TIME). When I got home, I looked at the sink and said ""hey, can you do the dishes now? I'm gonna go on a jog and be back."" She said she would. I go on my jog for like \~30 mins. I come back and she literally hasn't moved. The dishes are still in the sink. At this point I'm fucking FUMING. I have now asked you, TWICE to do the dishes! I look at her, very clearly pissed off. She looks at me THEN GOES BACK TO WATCHING HER SHOW. I go take a shower and I'm thinking ""SURELY she'll do the dishes while I'm in the shower. There's no way she could see how pissed I was and still sit there"". WRONG. I get out of the shower, put my uniform on, put my hair in a bun, walk into the kitchen and the DISHES ARE STILL. THERE. I get so annoyed I start doing them. I know that I shouldn't have because this is only enabling her behavior but I was so pissed off and disgusted that I just had to get it out of the way. but I did not do it quietly and I'm also rushing because IM ON BREAK!! I HAVE to be back by a set time because HELLO. IM IN THE MILITARY! So I'm angrily doing these dishes. She gets up as I'm doing them and slowly starts walking towards me while still staring at the TV. Remember the days before pausing shows and your mom asked you to do something for her, but you don't wanna miss what's happening so you slowly get up and walk out of the room while still looking at the TV? yeah. that. Except.. she was watching MHA on fucking netflix. PAUSE IT. This made me even MORE mad because am I rooming with a 21yo or a 5yo? be so fr. She gets over to me and picks up the strainer, looks me dead in my face and goes ""where does this go?"" I was floored. At that moment I had realized that she had never done dishes. Not once had she done them. How the fuck do you not know where the strainer goes?? I look at her absolutely dumbfounded and point out where it goes. Now she's just standing in the kitchen like a child while I am doing the dishes. I told her ""I got it"" with a mountain of attitude and she says ""okay"" and sits back down on the couch to continue watching her show. When I got back home that evening her McDonalds wrappers were still on the coffee table btw. :)

Months go by and I'm still dealing with this. I am getting so fed up but I'm locked into a year long lease, I have no way to break it and I'm not making much in the military at this time and can't live alone anyways. So I grin and bare it.

Now comes July. I'm FINALLY going home! I'm excited to see family, get the hell away from my apartment for a few weeks, and pick up my dog. I remind B that I'm bringing my dog up and double check that she is STILL okay with him being here. She said yes. I said ok, perfect. NOW.. here is where I was way too fucking nice to this girl. I was a huge people pleaser back in the day.

B said she had a friend coming up to stay and asked if he could sleep in my room. 99% of people would say lol absolutely-the fuck-not. but, as I said.. I was a people pleaser and just REALLY stupid. I said that the friend could stay in my room BUT, they are not to use my TV or xbox. They are not using my bathroom or toiletries because it's not my guest. They stay out of my drawers and closet and they are only to go in there to sleep and THAT'S IT. She is to provide linens for them and when I get home my bedding better be washed and bed made by the time I arrive. She agreed.

**DID I MENTION I WAS STUPID.**

The two weeks are up, I'm driving over 12hrs overnight with a dog in the car with me. When I get back I'm exhausted. I'm annoyed because I'd been driving for so long and I still have so much to do. I get upstairs and B has her best friend over. We'll call the best friend M because she will be popping back up later. I let the dog go so B can meet him and I go into my room to see my bedding ON THE GROUND and the bedding B's other friend used STILL ON MY BED. Now, me coming home at this time was NO SURPISE because I was updating B on my ETA the whole way. She knew. She just didn't care. I am FURIOUS. Before I can say anything B YELLS my name. I walk out and my dog is peeing on the floor. I was like awwwwww fuck. She goes ""I thought you said he was potty trained!"" I said ""he is. but he's also a year and a half. He's in a new place. He refused to potty on the ride up here and he's stressed out. I'm really really sorry, I'll get it cleaned up."" I immediately clean it up. No harm no foul, shit happens. It's a dog. He had also lived outside majority of the time back home, YES he was potty trained NO we did not have anymore accidents after this. but given he grew up on a farm then all of a sudden lived in an apartment, I let it slide. He was still maturing. it is what it is. I put him in my room while I go down to get  all of my stuff from the trip. I am hiking this stuff up 6 flights of stairs (that are outside), by myself, in what felt like the hottest week of the year. I get back up from my second trip, put things down. I'm sweating my ass off. B and M look at me. B goes ""do you want help?"" Me, being extremely annoyed with everything that has transpired in the last 20 minutes goes ""that'd be nice."" Then I walk out again. I grab more stuff, come back up and B and M are sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette. Oh, now I'm done. This point moving forward I'm pissed. I go back into my room and my dog is laying on my bedding because OH, THAT'S RIGHT! She didn't do anything I asked her to do. I go out to the porch and say ""why are my comforter and sheets on the FLOOR?"" she goes ""oh.. I forgot to put them in the wash"". I roll my eyes and walk back in. I start putting everything in the wash. Just like when she didn't do the dishes and I started doing them, she comes up behind me and said ""I can do it"" I said, no. It's fine. I'm already doing it. She INSISTED I let her do it. I said, ""fine. you can put the laundry detergent in and press start."" I then walk into my bathroom and I see flip flops, shampoo and conditioner and a bunch of toiletries that are NOT mine. I walk out and go ""Whose shit is in my bathroom??"" she goes ""oh that's M's."" I said.. I TOLD YOU, do NOT use my bathroom. Your friends use YOUR bathroom. Get it out. so M apologizes to me, said she didn't know and grabs her stuff. I said I wasn't mad at her, B is the one that should have told you.

At this point in time I have 6 months left on this damn lease and I'm about to pop a blood vessel. But we aren't even close to the end.

B is not as accepting of my dog as she made it out to be. She will not touch him. Finds dogs to be disgusting. Won't even pet him and hates when he walks around the house. When she was home he would be in my room or the crate because she wanted nothing to do with him. I had left him in the crate when I left while he got acclimated to his new lifestyle, then I allowed him to roam the house while nobody was home. One night he was out while B and I were at work. She ended up getting home early and he had eaten some of the fluff in the couch. She sent me a picture of him and the fluff and said ""your dog ate the couch"" I said aw fuck. sorry, put him in the crate and I'll deal with it when I get home. she said ""you need to buy a new couch"" I said... excuse me? lmfao I'm not buying a whole new couch for something that isn't even noticeable (flip the cushion around and it's fine.) she said ""this is embarrassing and people are going to notice when they come over. It looks trashy."" (Little back story on the couch, MY friend GAVE it to me for FREE. It is MY couch. not OUR couch.) Now, first of all.. who tf comes over for her? M? I know M, she does not care. for me? All of my friends are dog lovers and know that shit happens.. they do not care. and again, I flipped around the cushion and it was FINE. you couldn't feel where he ripped it and couldn't see it. she still said ""it's your dog, your responsibility. You need to buy a new couch"" I said ""B, if I'm going to buy anything for MY FREE COUCH, it will be a cover. That's all I'm doing."" I never ended up buying the couch cover because.. it wasn't noticeable. I cleaned up the fluff and my dog stayed in my room or the crate when nobody was home.

She never brought it up again but she HATED my dog. One time she made a quesadilla and we both stepped out for a smoke. She came back and it was gone. She comes back out and goes ""WHERE DID MY FOOD GO?? DID YOUR DOG EAT IT?"" I said.. did you leave it on the coffee table..? she goes ""yeah??"" I said ""well.. he towers over it.. and he isn't even 2. Why would you leave food out on the counter?"" she's like ""why isn't he trained to not do that?"" I said, ""99% of dogs will grab food if nobody is around them to say no girl."" like.. pls.. do we lack common sense? It's an animal. and in my defense.. I didn't think she would leave it on the fucking coffee table or I would've told her hey... don't do that.

Another morning, I went to work and my dog is in the crate. I was rushing a bit because I woke up late and he went poop outside but didn't pee. She messaged me an hour later saying he's howling. I said oh, I'm sorry. He probably needs to pee. He didn't go this morning and I was rushing. Do you mind taking him out? She said ""I've never walked a big dog before"" I was like oh, he does not pull at all. He goes pee on that grassy median outside. It'll be quick. I kid you not, 2 minutes passes and she goes ""he didn't go pee"". That girl did NOT take him outside. Luckily, the dog walker would be there in a few hours to take him out but there was quite literally nothing I could do.

Now, before anyone says anything about me ""allowing"" these things to happen with my dog, this all happened within like.. the first month he was there. Him and I were both acclimating to a new life. He was learning to live inside in a small space. I was learning his quirks, setting a schedule and figuring out what worked for him.

By this point things had gotten so bad between us that we weren't even speaking. She was disgusting, had a terrible attitude, manipulative and acted like nothing she did was wrong. I walked into her room once and it was the most deplorable sight I have ever seen. a MOUNTAIN of dirt clothes that smelled rancid and trash/old food everywhere. The smell will never leave my nose dude. It was no wonder she was dirty in the common areas.

There were many other little things that happened but it was basically same thing different font. I had talked to M about her behavior and found out that they were no longer friends because of how manipulative she was. I was told she was a chronic liar and would tell people this twisted/made-up version of whatever spat she had with others.

The last big blowout we had was when we were about to move out. I had moved out before she did. She said that she was throwing a going away party with her friends and asked if she could use my room for the beer pong table. I said it was fine (all of my shit was out of there anyways except a few boxes), just move the boxes to the closet and make sure she puts a tarp down so no mess gets on the carpet AND clean up after everyone. She said okay. After she is officially moved out, I go back to the apartment to get the rest of my boxes with my NEW roommate (I love her, we're still friends) and it is a MESS. And she can't help me clean it because she was leaving to get stationed in Hawaii. I had already told my new roommate (we'll call her A) about B and everything that transpired. She immediately did not like her at all. A see's the mess and goes ""she is fucking disgusting."" I IMMEDIATELY text B and I'm like.. What the actual fuck is wrong with you. Why in the world would you leave all this shit for me to clean up KNOWING I would have to??? B goes ""I didn't have time because I'm PCSing (this means leaving one duty station and going to another at the end of your contract)."" I was like ??? Wtf do you mean you DIDNT HAVE TIME? she goes ""Moving 15 minutes down the road and across the country is completely different."" I said.. YOU KNEW FOR MONTHS YOU WERE MOVING???? and what does that have ANYTHING to do with NOT cleaning up the mess you made??? I went OFF on her. (I still have the texts and can post them in the comments. I don't have my phone right now). She ended up leaving food debris on the stove and counter, alcohol in the fridge, freezer and on top of the fridge. The pantry was still full. There were spills on the carpet. Her room smelled to high heavens and there was grime/hair all over her bathroom.

A ended up helping me clean everything. It took us hours and I am so appreciative of her. She treated my dog as if he were her own and when I was working nights he slept in her room. We never fought and when we had some sort of disagreement (which was hardly ever), we were communicative and receptive. She would feed him when I wasn't home, take him out, play with him. When she got her own dog, she never shafted him. I think that was the biggest heartbreak for me with B. She said she was okay with my dog and he ended up having to live a very limited life because she couldn't stand him. I worry about what she might've done when I wasn't home. My poor baby deserved so much better that year.

But yeah, that was the WORST roommate I have ever experienced. I vowed after A that I would never have a roommate again because good ones that you click with are hard to come by.

Moral of the story, talk to people who know your soon-to-be roommate before you move in with them. Talk to their previous roommates and DONT be a people pleaser like me. Be firm in your boundaries. I let this girl walk all over me for that year. I will never do that again. AND TYPE UP A ROOMMATE MEMORANDUM/AGREEMENT!!!! Have everything in writing. Get locks for your bedroom and even camera's in your room if needed if you're not able to get out of the situation!!

PS. if I can find the pictures of the mess she would leave, I'll post them in the comments. If you stuck around and read all of this, I hope my year of roommate hell was worth the read lol",4,1749088635.0,badroommates,7,0.67,False

Ever since I was a small child I’ve felt absolute shock that people work and/or go to school for 6-8+ hours a day. I’m 30 years old and I still feel it’s a cruel world of pure torture for this reason. LIKE HOW IS THIS REAL. THIS CANNOT BE LEGAL. 

What I didn’t realize until recently, is that it’s probably because of my ADHD. I have struggled my whole life with school, work, friendships, everything really. And I was ultimately diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety around 18. HA! HA! Ha…. 

Throughout my life I’ve struggled to hold a job for more than a year. I’ve never been fired, but I ultimately quit because it gives me major depression and I get completely burnout/turn into a major B. 
 
HOW DO YOU GUYS KEEP A JOB? Grow, thrive, enjoy it, obtain a liveable salary, maybe even save a retirement fund? I mostly hate working for other people but I really hate working in general. I want to do my hobbies and be with my kids. I want to have the ability to go get a coffee whenever I want or pick up my phone if it rings. I want to wear what I want. I want to be free like a GD bird. I don’t want to have to smile for people all day. It literally hurts my face muscles. 

I need happy stories of “success” and finding happiness in the never ending cycle of work. But also I just needed to rant and maybe find some solidarity.

1l3na01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1l3na01/another_msc_story/,Another MSC story,"
I recently cruised on the Seashore on a 3 day cruise that was comped due to my Caesar’s Diamond status. I have previously sailed with Princess, Holland and Carnival and am a frequent cruiser. This was my first Msc cruise in comparison to the other 3 lines. 

Embarkation: process was fairly speedy.  It’s a massive ship so lots of people to board. About as good as Carnival I’d say for comparison. Getting on the ship, they ushered everyone to the lido, so it got really crowded, really fast. The cabins weren’t ready until 3 so literally everyone is on the Lido. One of the first differences I noticed was they have zero included casual food options. So unlike all the other ships where you can go get a guys burger or go to the dining room to spread out the crowd, 6000 people are jammed into one area. It was pretty much a mess until they announced rooms were open. 

Cabin: this was pretty much on par with I’d say Carnival. We had a balcony with a beautiful view. Ocean Cay was a great port. Bed was nice and we slept good. The bathroom was the major drawback.  The sink area is very small so no room to put any tolietries. So they had to go on the desk outside. The shower had no door. Really a strange thing and obviously there was water all over the floor because of it. Who thought this design was a good idea?

Drinks: the drink package is not cheap and doesn’t have any additional benefits but for 3 days we said what the hell. The bars are plentiful and drinks are strong. Probably the best part of the experience. Sports bar was really big and a cool setting with games on all day. Pro tip: they serve food there and it’s paid but way better than other food option. Brooklyn Bar was also a cool place and pretty popular. Good coffee in the morning and good bar service. 

Food: a real lowlight. The buffet was definitely not on par with the other lines. The  only real free option is the buffet and it felt very unsanitary. It was not covered well and lots of children picking things up and setting them back down, sneezing and then grabbing the tongs etc. the paid options were better but still below other lines. We ate at ocean cay seafood. The food was good and the service was good. A really strange thing though is the restaurant is right next to a door that goes to the sun deck and people go in and out, slamming the door every 15-30 seconds or so. So you’re eating your Dover Sole and SLAM! Over and over. Your whole dinner. Really surprising no one there ever considered this is not the high end experience people expect for a speciality restaurant. The restaurant manager had to know about it and basically just ignore it. The Hola Tacos were awesome. Definitely recommend that place. The most disappointing experience was the sushi restaurant. We had it booked through the app and looked through the menu and were excited. We showed up and were told by the host that the only option that night was all you can eat.  No a la carts. We said well it didn’t say anything when we booked and no one contacted us. She shrugged and said well sorry but that’s the deal: all you can eat or cancel your reservations. We walked away empty handed on what could have been an easy solution for MSC to save two customers. Unfortunately the “how can we make this right?” line never came. 

Overall Cleanliness: a major difference between the other American lines and MSC is cleanliness. While cabins were clean, they generally were so understaffed that it took until 5-6pm to get your cabin clean. Many times we came back from port and it was still not done. 
Dishes, glassware, old food would pile up in the hallways.  Totally filthy and disgusting. They are only collected once a day so get used to seeing that half eaten burger and old martini glass in the hallways it will be there awhile. If it sounds gross it’s because it is. Overheard someone say they called guest services about it 3 times and it still took them over 14 hours to clean their floor. Simply, it was way behind other carriers and disgusting. 

Main areas are cleaned regularly and in good shape. 

Dining time: it’s assigned and yes, that sucks. Carnival, Holland and Princess all have dine at your leisure. Why MSC can’t figure that out is a mystery. We never went at our assigned time because it was inconvenient and could not be changed. 

Entertainment: le Cabert rouge was awesome.  Great band, singers and performers. A really great venue and fun time. Very unique place. The main stage had a good show too. A notch above the main stages of the other 3. Not much but better. The comedian was bad but let’s face it, most of them are on these ships. 

Overall: hard to not have fun on a cruise and we did. I’m normally an optimist but this was not a great experience. The standards across the board were much lower on MSC. From the food to the cleanliness to AC barely keeping up, unresponsive guest services, messy elevators, even paid options like thermal suite are inferior. The app is dreadful. 

A lot of Americans we talked to were complaining from day to day. Are we spoiled? Maybe. But Princess, Carnival and Holland are miles ahead of MSC. This will be a one and done for us.

Lately they haven’t been. I’m a return employee, that’s fine. but the business isn’t being ran in the way it was before leaving and it’s for the worst. To get to my point, my supervisor was taking orders and it wasn’t alot, a few drinks, pretzels, sandwiches split up across like 4 orders- not a big deal. but then i get pulled to the front to check in guests, then run back to make food. then pulled to the front to check people out. then back to making food. then someone tells me
the delivery guy is here, i let him in. run back to my food, i maybe have 2 orders sent out by this point. run to let the guy out and sign his form. our front end check in desk ISN’T working. to check in guests i have to use our tablets which takes 5x as long to verify their info. on top of this, a kid tripped the security alarm- im alone- i run to the door, remember i’m alone and double back to turn off the alarm.  jump back in- TO STILL MAKE FOOD I’VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR 20 MINUTES NOW- a kid gets his finger stuck in our equipment- liability 

- majority of our guests have children with special needs today- that’s not a problem except i personally think there needs to be an extra set of eyes on the facility BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS OF THESE CHILDREN- given one of them set off the security alarm trying to leave through a restricted door. particularly “needy” customers “my coffee isn’t sweet enough, thanks for putting more syrup in but now it’s too sweet can i have more milk” just overall NEEDY. 

THEN because i was being torn back and forth, a child shit in our facility in the corner, cause no one was watching.

now after all of this, I wasn’t even mad. Stressed to yards? yeah. but i wasn’t mad.

“im just saying-“

and i cut her off, very emotional,”AND IM JUST SAYING YOU LEFT ME ALONE. SO OK [name].” i finished my lunch and went to the car to try and calm down. got myself really worked up. texted the owners that i could work the shift (even if i didn’t want to) but i was very much willing to and could… but i was also losing my mind at the moment and while what she said -wasn’t- all that bad- it wasn’t necessary, needed, or very fair at the time. especially given what i had just dealt with. even if she had zero awareness of what i went through, there was no reason to act like me forgetting an order for 10 minutes- while doing the jobs of 3 people but by myself- ruined her job or ability work. especially when SHE screwed me over horribly for 30 minutes.

1l3n2iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1l3n2iw/opinionsadvice_needed_please/,Opinions/advice needed please!,"I had a lightbulb moment today. I have been dealing with my with embarrassing flatulence for about two years. It started after I gave birth to my 4th child. I had a c section (2nd one). I assumed it was hormones, I was breastfeeding and I typically just take forever to adjust back to 'normal' postpartum. It's taken me a few years the first three times, so I assumed it was related to that. I had incredibly toxic gas, all the time, no matter what I ate. Constant hunger, fatigue, BM 2/3/4 times a day.  Not always diarrhea. All those things can be explained by postpartum so I didn't think much of it. I went dairy free because I was breastfeeding and started having oat milk in my coffee so I assumed that some of the flatulence had to do with that. It never went away however, until I started taking zepbound last year(after I had stopped breastfeeding obviously).  I was just unable to lose weight and exhausted and had high blood pressure from preeclampsia. I needed some help and was tired of always doing things the hard way. I lost about 40 lbs and the flatulence also stopped! I had normal BM and felt great overall. I was snacking a lot less and able to control my hunger so I made better food choices. Anyway, I stopped zepbound a few months ago and the flatulence and hunger and constant BM's are back. I'm obviously annoyed because it's embarrassing and inconvenient and all the time. My diet hasn't changed and it's the same every day, no matter what I eat. I was stumped about why it went away when I took zepbound then came back. Google says GLP-1's can have this effect with celiac and the correlation with the surgery also fits. Obviously I'm in the beginning stages of looking into this but thoughts? Opinions?

I don’t remember consciously deciding to leave the apartment. The next thing I knew, I was in the hallway outside my door, breathing hard, still clutching the phone with that damned image on the screen. I’d grabbed my keys and slipped my feet into the untied sneakers by the door out of some automatic survival impulse.

It was only after the heavy fire door closed behind me, locking me out of my own unit, that I paused to think. The corridor was empty and quiet, lit by dim sconces. It was nearly 3:30 a.m. by now. Where could I go? I couldn’t exactly bang on a neighbor’s door. I felt a pang of embarrassment even considering it – “Hi, I’m your new neighbor, I’m convinced an invisible something is in my apartment, can I crash on your couch?” Not happening.

The adrenaline was wearing off, and I sank to sit on the hallway floor, my back against the wall. I needed to think. The logical part of my brain was unraveling, outmatched by the visceral terror I’d just experienced. That image... I looked at it again, wanting to be sure I hadn't imagined it. No, it was there, in grainy black and gray: an elongated blur looming over me.

I realized something else then: the blur’s shape, even though unclear, it reminded me of me. Not just human, but vaguely *similar to my own outline*. The way it stood, the height compared to the chair... Could it have been imitating me sitting there? Or perhaps it was coincidence. My mind was likely in overdrive trying to find patterns. Yet the notion crawled under my skin – was it copying me?

An uncanny memory surfaced: earlier that day I found my bathroom door closed when I swore I left it open. And a few days ago I could have *sworn* I left a kitchen cabinet ajar only to find it shut tight. Little things I’d brushed off. But what if it had been inside, watching me, learning how I lived? My routines, my habits...

I sat in that hallway for a long time, too scared to go back inside, too drained to go anywhere else. In the end, I went down to the lobby. The security guard – Alan – startled when I emerged from the elevator in my disheveled state. I must have looked wild-eyed and pale. I told him a half-truth: that I thought someone had broken in, that I had evidence on camera. He took me seriously then, calling the police immediately.

Two officers arrived within fifteen minutes. I was embarrassed as I led them to my apartment, recounting that I'd gotten motion alerts and saw an intruder on camera. I deliberately didn’t mention invisible figures or any of the more unbelievable details. I just said someone had been inside and I fled.

The police searched my apartment thoroughly. They found no one, of course. What they did find were a few odd signs that made them radio for a crime scene unit: The chain on the door had been ripped clean off – the screws tore out of the wood as if forced from inside. I hadn’t even noticed that in my panicked exit. One officer asked if I had done that; I stammered no, it was latched and I had to undo it to leave, so I had no idea how it got pulled out. He frowned as though I was lying or confused.

Also, my laptop was smashed on the floor – the entire screen shattered as if something very heavy had stomped on it. Bits of glass and plastic strewn about. That definitely hadn’t happened when I left; I remember just the phone falling. The rest of the living room was disheveled too: the coffee table was knocked over, the book and wine glass on the floor (wine soaked into the rug like blood), the floor lamp toppled. It looked like a struggle had taken place.

I could see the cops exchanging looks. I knew what it looked like – like a fight or some rampage had occurred. “Maybe you interrupted a burglary,” one officer suggested kindly. “Though it’s odd – nothing appears stolen.” My TV, laptop, other electronics were still present (if broken).

I mumbled something about how maybe they ran when I screamed. I couldn't bring myself to contradict with the fact that the intruder, if it existed, had not entered through the door or windows at all.

I did show them the photo captured by my security app. They examined it with perplexity. To my relief, they didn’t dismiss it outright. It did show *something*. One of them asked if I had a robe or coat hanging there (which could look like a person). I pointed to the coat rack which was across the room, not behind the chair. They had to admit the image did look like a person, even if blurry. “Could be a malfunction,” one said, but not in a convincing tone.

They took a copy of the image and my statement, advising me to stay somewhere else for the rest of the night and get that door chain fixed. They were polite, but I could tell they didn’t know what to do with this. No sign of forced entry (from outside at least), no suspect, just my story and a weird picture.

After they left, I packed a quick overnight bag and took the most important things (laptop was useless now, but phone and charger, wallet, a change of clothes). I wasn't staying here either way. As I was about to exit, I hesitated, a gnawing feeling drawing me back in. I realized I wanted one thing – the little thermal camera attachment under the coffee table. The cops had missed it. I snatched it up and pocketed it.

I spent the rest of the night at a 24-hour diner, then dozed in my car as morning slowly brightened the sky. I must have looked like a wreck—unshaven, eyes bloodshot, jumping at every little sound.

By daylight, with people bustling around on the streets, things felt slightly more normal. I told myself maybe this whatever-it-was would be gone now. Maybe it only haunted me at 3:17 a.m. specifically, like some bizarre temporal fluke. Part of me even wondered if I had a peculiar sleep disorder or stress-induced delusion—except I had physical evidence that something happened. The photo, the broken chain, the wrecked furniture... Those were very real.

I contacted a handyman service and by afternoon had the door chain repaired and a new deadbolt installed, one with an electronic keypad so I could monitor any entries via an app. It sounds crazy, but I needed to feel I could keep *something* out, even if I wasn’t sure what I was barring.

When Brian came by that weekend as promised, I finally confided in him about the full strangeness. I half expected him to laugh or call me nuts, but he grew quiet as I laid out everything. We sat at the kitchen table in the midday sun, the motion sensors still armed (they didn’t trigger in daylight at least). I showed him the thermal device and even re-created how I saw the shape. He kept shaking his head in disbelief.

“You’re sure you weren’t hallucinating? Like, were you fully awake?” he asked gently.

“I was wide awake. And I got this image. Something set off the sensor – multiple times. You saw the living room, Brian. You saw my door.” I gestured to the repaired chain. He couldn’t deny it.

He proposed an experiment: we’d stay up that night together, cameras ready, and see if it appeared when there were two of us. Safety in numbers, maybe. Honestly, I was relieved at the idea. I did not want to face another 3:17 alone.

We passed the evening with takeout and an ironic choice of horror movie to lighten the mood. I was jumpy, and every so often Brian would reassure me with a chuckle, ""If Casper shows up, we'll bust him."" But I could tell he was uneasy too, despite the bravado.

As the clock crept toward three, we sat in the brightly lit living room with an array of devices: my phone with the thermal camera, his high-end DSLR on a tripod set to record video, and every light on (though I doubted brightness would deter it if it had already come out in the light before). We spoke little as the time approached, an unspoken tension drawing us both taut.

3:10...3:15... We both fell silent, eyes darting between the clocks and the room. The air felt still, heavy like before a storm. I realized I was holding the thermal viewer with sweaty palms, pointing it toward the hallway and kitchen, the direction the shape came from last time.

At 3:17, Brian’s DSLR, set to motion detect as well, emitted a little beep and started recording. He stiffened, looking around. I saw nothing with my eyes. But on my thermal screen—there it was. Emerging just at the edge, near the front door this time, as if it had been right by us all along. A swath of heat, taller now, more defined.

I tried to speak, to tell Brian, but my voice caught in panic. The shape drifted forward, heading not for me this time, but toward Brian. He was looking in the wrong direction, squinting toward the kitchen, and didn't see it.

""Bri—behind you!"" I managed to shout.

He whipped around, and for one awful second he and the shape intersected on my thermal view—the orange of his body overlapping with the ghostly orange figure. Brian staggered, as if hit by a wave of dizziness. Later he told me he felt an intense heat at his back that scared him senseless.

He stumbled away, nearly tripping over the coffee table. I saw the shape continue moving, slowly and with what I can only describe as *purpose*. Now it was headed to the armchair, to where I had been sitting the night it attacked.

Without warning, every light in the apartment went out. We were plunged into darkness—except my phone's screen, which glowed with the thermal image. I heard Brian curse, and the scrape of him grabbing something—maybe the flashlight.

The figure on screen turned its head side to side, as if confused or searching. In the sudden dark, I realized, maybe it couldn’t see us clearly. Could it rely on darkness somehow? Or had it killed the lights intentionally?

""Get out!"" I hissed at Brian. I fumbled toward him, knocking into the couch. The emergency lighting from the hallway glowed faintly under the door; that was our target. I didn't care about evidence anymore—I wanted to live.

Brian was ahead of me, feeling along the wall. The thermal showed the shape near the center of the room, not rushing, but following. It moved in fits and starts – a jerky motion, almost glitching from point to point. And every few feet, it looked more solid on the camera, as if feeding off something.

We made it to the door. I shoved Brian through first. He fumbled with the handle but thankfully I'd left the new deadbolt unlocked expecting our flight. We burst into the hallway, nearly falling over each other. Behind us, from the dark apartment, I swear I heard a creak of the floor.

We slammed the door. My hands shook violently as I jammed the key into the lock to manually seal the deadbolt. Once it clicked, we backed away, panting.

Brian was pale as death, shining his flashlight at the closed door. ""What the hell was that?"" he whispered.

I could only shake my head, heart too busy trying to climb into my throat. In my hand, the thermal image still danced on the phone. The figure had moved right up to the inside of my front door. It stood there, as if staring through, a bright splotch against the door’s outline. Then it slowly faded, its heat dispersing until the screen showed just the cooling door.

We didn't stay after that. We retreated to the lobby, where the night security guard looked at us like we were insane. We must have babbled something about a gas leak or electrical problem—I don't even remember. We left, driving to Brian’s place across town at 4 a.m. in silence.

By tacit agreement, we didn't discuss details until daylight. When we finally did, sitting in his kitchen with untouched mugs of coffee, it took me showing him the thermal footage (yes, his DSLR and my phone both had caught glimpses) for him to fully accept it. ""I thought I was having a stroke or something when that heat hit me,"" he admitted, voice trembling. ""But... I saw it on your phone. Jesus, it was right behind me.""

I told him my theory: it was learning. Each night it got bolder, more defined. And possibly, mimicking me. Now maybe mimicking him too. The way it moved, where it lingered—the armchair, then trying to approach him from behind, like it had done with me. It was copying tactics? Or just curious? Either way, it was intelligent. And perhaps even more disturbing, it was confined to my apartment. When we left, it didn’t chase us out. It stayed, almost like it had claimed that space.

""Maybe it's bound there,"" Brian suggested. He was grasping for any logic. ""Like a ghost haunting a place.""

""Or it's bound to me,"" I said, shuddering. ""I mean, it only appears when I'm there. But... if it were bound to me, it would follow, right?""

We debated possibilities in circles, nothing making perfect sense. All I knew was I could not go back there alone. Not tonight, maybe not ever.

Later that day I got a call from the building manager – apparently, the tenant below me had water leaking from their ceiling, and maintenance entered my apartment (with my permission via phone) to find my bathroom faucet running, sink overflowing. I hadn't been in that bathroom at all that night. Thankfully minimal damage, but it was as if someone had turned it on deliberately.

That chilled me. Was the entity messing with things when I wasn't home? Or had it been doing that while I was there and I just hadn’t noticed? Little unexplained things clicked into place: the closed door, the moved items. It had been active beyond just tripping sensors.

I decided then I had to confront this somehow, or permanently break my lease and flee. But if I ran, who knows if it might attach anyway? I needed more information.

Research became my life over the next two days. I contacted the device manufacturer and grilled them, but aside from confirming my logs of motion and the weird image, they had nothing. I scoured paranormal forums (feeling ridiculous, but desperate) for any mention of entities triggered by motion sensors or showing up on thermal. There were stories, plenty of them, but each had their own lore and none quite matched mine.

One idea came from an old thread: using something like a fine powder or flour on the floor to see footprints. It sounded like a movie trick, but I resolved to try if I dared to re-enter the apartment. After all, the thing had clearly physical effects (it moved objects, touched Brian, etc.).

Brian agreed to come with me one last time, in daylight, to gather my important belongings and also set a kind of trap for evidence. He insisted I not stay another night, and I didn’t argue.

We went in the afternoon, bright sun streaming through the windows as we cautiously opened the door. The place felt stale, a slight odor like hot wires or burnt dust. Inside, more things were amiss: my dining chairs were all pulled out from the table, one knocked over. My bookshelf had books strewn on the floor. It looked like a drunken poltergeist had rampaged.

We tiptoed in, calling out a shaky “hello?” as if expecting it to answer. Silence. The sensor was disarmed now (I had left it off after the last event, not wanting alarms without me there).

We worked quickly. I packed clothes, personal documents, my work laptop, essentials. Meanwhile, Brian, both skeptical and fascinated, sprinkled a bag of flour in a wide circle on the living room hardwood floor. We covered a good portion of the floor between the hall and the front door, as well as a patch by the sofa where it often stood. It was messy, but if something stepped there, we’d know.

As we were finishing up, Brian asked me to grab the last of the cameras. I realized I left the small USB security cam plugged in by the entryway (I’d added it hoping to capture more). I went to yank it out of the outlet, and as I did, I felt... odd. A prickling on the back of my neck.

It was 3:15 in the afternoon, broad daylight, but I felt suddenly like it was night again and I was being watched. I froze, then slowly turned. Nothing visible, of course. But the sense of presence was unmistakable.

Brian was across the room, zipping my duffel bag. He looked up at me, noticing my posture. “You okay?”

Before I could answer, we both heard it: a soft *click* from the hallway. The sound of my bedroom door gently closing on its own. We had left it open; I was sure of it.

Brian stared at me, eyes wide. I mustered a whisper: “Time to leave. Now.”

As we made a fast exit, I glanced down at the flour on the floor. Something was happening – a disturbance in the powder. Footprints started to form, one after another, striding toward us. Yet nothing visible made them. They were human-shaped prints, the size of mine perhaps, appearing one by one, the flour indenting under unseen weight.

I wish I could say we stayed to see more, but we didn't. Survival instinct kicked in and we bolted, slamming the door behind us and not stopping until we were outside, breathing the fresh air like escapees from a mine shaft.

That was yesterday. We’re at Brian’s now, camped in his living room like kids afraid of the dark. I don’t know what to do next. The thing in my apartment – it knows we know. And it’s not just some passive haunt; it’s active, intelligent, and intent on... something. On me.

I fear that it has been studying me, adopting my patterns. Those footprints were exactly my shoe size, I realized. It wasn’t just mimicking a human – it was mimicking *this* human. My gait, my shape. The image on the camera looking like me, the way it lingered where I'd been sitting. Piece by piece, it’s learning to become me.

As I write this, using Brian’s laptop, my thoughts keep circling a terrible idea: what if its endgame is to replace me? Could it steal my face, my voice, my life? Maybe it already started. It knew how to unlock my doors, how to move like me in my space. What if that night the door chain was ripped out not because it couldn’t get in, but because it didn’t need doors? Or because it was already inside and I was trying to keep it from leaving, from going out into the world wearing my skin?

I know how crazy this sounds. But I can’t shake the image of those empty footprints stalking toward me in my own home. I can’t unsee that blurred figure standing over my shoulder, as if posing to take my place in that one captured frame.

We’ve decided not to go back. I’ll break my lease, leave most of the furniture, whatever. But deep down, I’m terrified it might not matter. If it can leave that apartment now that it’s taken on my form – where will it go? Will it follow me? Is it already ahead of me somehow, living my life where I’m not?

I haven’t checked the motion alerts since yesterday. I’m too afraid. But just now, as I sit here typing this, my phone buzzed. A notification from the security app – the one I hadn't deleted yet. My blood turned to ice as I read it:

“Front Door opened.”

A second later: “Front Door closed.”

In the app’s log, it shows those events, time-stamped 3:17 a.m. I stared at the notification, a sick realization dawning. I’m not at the apartment. Brian is here next to me, and no one else should be in that unit. But something just opened and closed my front door at the witching minute, as casually as a tenant leaving for a late-night walk.

I don’t know where it’s going at this hour, or if it will come here next. All I know is that I’m shaking as I show Brian the alert. He reads it and we lock eyes. Neither of us says what we’re both thinking:

It’s learned enough to leave.

And if it can leave, it can be anywhere. It could be anyone. It could even be standing right behind me as I finish writing this, watching with unseen eyes as I document our last moments of safety. I’m afraid to turn around.",7,1749087355.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

A Field Report from Mr. Awesome
Posted by Eliza Tilde Vaughn

A good friend of mine, known affectionately as Mr. Awesome, just got back from Contact in the Desert 2025. He's a close companion and an occasional contributor to the ideas I post. He’s not a speaker, not a panelist, not affiliated with anything official. Just a guy who showed up, grounded himself with a magic mug, and wandered into something strange, hilarious, and a little beautiful. This is his report.

Contact 2025

I didn’t go to Contact in the Desert to find aliens. I went because I needed a break from my usual life, which involves cats, government tech, and a growing sense that the world is glitching. I figured I’d listen to some wild theories, maybe get sunburned near a pool, and meet someone who once astral-projected into the cockpit of a UFO.

What I found was a Star Trek cult, a haunted mug, and Richard Dolan playing ping pong like it was 1979 and the fate of disclosure depended on it.

Let me set the scene.

At Contact, you don’t just hear people speak from a stage. You share elevator rides with them. You can grab a drink while Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp are doing the same, and Ross Coulthart is talking shop five feet away. Steve Bassett is at a table brooding over his laptop. Someone nearby is probably holding a dowsing rod. Everyone’s just there. No handlers. No velvet ropes. You can stand by the Terrace Lounge and feel like you’re eavesdropping on the next chapter of UFO history.

I checked in Wednesday night with my cats, Schrödinger and Enrico Fermi. Schrödinger immediately vanished beneath the hotel bed, existing in a quantum state of both here and totally inaccessible until I made eye contact with her the next morning. I looked at my reflection, adjusted my cowboy hat, and reminded myself that “Mr. Awesome” was printed on my badge because “Certified Time-Traveling Cat Dad” wouldn't fit in the font.

Thursday was my first full day. I hit the panels hard. Lectures on plasma intelligences, recovered materials, and consciousness as the real operating system of the universe. The chairs were punishing. I think I left my lumbar support in a different timeline. I had a deep conversation with renowned astronomer Marc D’Antonio, and the rest of the night passed in a blur, imbibed with adult beverages. After all, your room is just upstairs. It’s that kind of vibe.

Friday morning, I woke up sore and spiritually misaligned. So I went to 7 AM yoga. I am not a yoga guy. But I showed up, stretched what I could stretch, and walked out with ninety percent less pain and a confusing amount of emotional clarity.

Then I found a group of goddesses at a booth called Earth Field.

They’re ceramicists, priestesses of the clay really, selling handmade mugs and bowls crafted from clay they harvest themselves from mountaintops. They bless the clay, fire it with intention, and say you can ground your energy through their pottery. I was holding iced coffee in a plastic cup. They looked at me like I’d shown up barefoot to a wedding.

I bought a mug on the spot. Picked one up that had a perfect groove for my thumb. I told them not to wrap it. Poured my coffee in right there. They erupted in joy. I think they adopted me. Took my picture like I’d just completed some kind of rite. I carried that mug with me for the rest of the conference. Still use it. It might be the most emotionally supportive object I own.

Saturday was when I met Lenny.

Lenny was tall, rail-thin, frail, and walked like he was conducting a personal experiment in gravity resistance. He wore an On Golden Pond fishing hat. He said he’d been investigating the UFO phenomenon since 1966. He took a 16-hour Greyhound ride all the way from Mount Shasta. We sat together for a while. I gave him my lunch pass and we talked. He was one of the kindest, most sincere people I met all weekend.

Then I ruined everything.

I pointed out a group sitting nearby dressed in what looked like Star Trek cosplay. I told Lenny I suspected they were a recruiting cult. He hadn’t noticed them before. He turned, squinted, nodded, and then stood up and walked directly toward them.
Before I could move, they were misting him with something, saying prayers, and no joke, handing him a pen. Lenny signed something. I sat there frozen, horrified that I had just funneled a UFO elder into a cosplay cult with onboarding paperwork.

He came back smiling.

On Monday morning, as he was heading out to catch his bus, he found me again. He said, “You changed my life in three different ways this weekend.”

Then he smiled, shook my hand, and added, “Maybe I’ll see you next year… if I’m still around.”

I nodded, unsure whether to laugh or salute. I felt a tear forming in my eye.

Saturday night, I sat on a couch near the outdoor water feature next to two strangers who thought I had arrived with one of their friends. That friend, it turns out, was Danny Sheehan’s son. When they realized I was just a rogue wanderer named Mr. Awesome, we all started laughing and kept going until 2 AM. That’s how I met Isidore and Cassandra. They were sharp, hilarious, and had the kind of natural chemistry where conversation doesn’t feel like work. Cassandra said we should start a podcast. I didn’t get their numbers. Some synchronicities are meant for just one magical moment.

That same night, I ran into a woman named Madel. She’s a respected figure in the experiencer world. She channels entities and seems to know half the crowd. We had a great talk about high-control religions and how both of us had managed to escape them. We were mid-conversation when a guy nearby leaned over and said, “Hey… see that group over there? They’re looking for people like you.”
It was the same Star Trek cult.
I said, “Are you seriously trying to recruit us into a cult right after we just told you about escaping one?”
He hesitated. I stared. Madel nearly fell out of her seat laughing.

Sunday was a blur of laughter, poolside conversations, shared stories, and moments that felt too perfect to explain. I met Chris Bledsoe and later attended his orb gathering, although Chris doesn’t like to call it a summoning. I watched Richard Dolan play ping pong in a suit. I’m pretty sure someone in the pool was remote viewing the future. And I heard more sincere, no-shame stories about alien encounters than I’ve ever heard in my life.

That’s the real magic of Contact in the Desert.
You don’t have to pretend. You don’t have to explain. You don’t have to hide the weird parts of yourself to fit in. You’re suddenly surrounded by people who get it. People who nod instead of laugh when you say you’ve seen something. People who’ve spent years watching the same skies and carrying the same questions.

I didn’t find aliens.
(Except for the one Nordic who was a recruiter for the UFO cult, and several hybrids trying to blend in.)
But I found connection.
And a mug made by beautiful Pleiadians.
And a kind, soft-spoken man named Lenny who somehow walked straight into a cult and came out glowing.

Yes, I have the Dolan ping pong video. Ask me nicely.

— Mr. Awesome

so there was the initial hint given the leters in state of play, State of pLaY spelling Sly. but tbh it's a pretty weak theory so we need to find more clues. luckily the annoucneemnts today have some MAJOR hints. for one, THIEF VR was announced -- need i say more. this is our first indication that not only is the raccoon coming back, but he's coming back in vr. crazy. okay but we need to solidify this theory.

sony also announced an official fighting stick, which is a piece of extremely strong evidence because we all know the sly 5 loyalists have been fighting extremely hard to tooth and nail, and i cant blame them, poor souls havent played a video game since thieves in time, so their fight has not gone wasted thanks to the fighting controller announcement.

the astro bot dlc update was also a subtle clue, because there will be 5 (FIVE!!) new pieces of content being added which is crazy. you might think its coincidence but trust me its not

ok lastly there was a ghost of yotei trailer for a trailer near the very end, which had sucker punch's logo on it. fans of the trilogy will know that sucke rpucnh was the developers of the first three games, and i believe the trailer announcmenet for a trailer was actually a sly (heh get it?) misidrection by sony to say taht we'll get sly cooper news in july.

crazy times we live in. stay excited fellow thieves and thievettes. and for the love of god if you havent played a single video game since thieves in time at least go play last of us or something. ok peace out",4,1749087037.0,Slycooper,5,0.6,False

Each time, I would hear their voices filling the next room and turn on the recording to record them.

Five years and ninety-eight times.

Today, it was a fresh-faced, delicate college student.

Once they were done, Blake called for me to come in and clean up.

Kendall Davis lay lazily in his arms, a teasing smile playing on her lips as she spoke, ""Blake, is this the old, ugly wife you mentioned? ""

Blake idly ran his fingers through Kendall’s hair, offering nothing more than a dismissive grunt.

Kendall tossed the blanket aside, her skin marked with fresh hickeys, her grin wide. ""See? This is how a man reacts to a young, beautiful woman. As a woman, you really failed.""

I stayed silent, my gaze fixed on the floor, as I quietly cleaned up the mess.

Their laughter echoed through the room, a cruel reminder of the silence that surrounded me.

Once I retreated to my room, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the safe.

Five years had passed, and in all that time, it felt as though I had forgotten Blake and I were only bound by a contract.

One week. Just one more week and the divorce would be final.

——

The next morning, I woke early, as I always did.

Blake had already called me three times, demanding breakfast in his bedroom.

Without a second thought, I refused.

""Don't you have hands or feet? Should I feed you bite by bite?""

I ended the call just as Blake stormed into the room, his finger jabbing at me.

""Laura, who are you throwing a tantrum at? Don’t forget whose house you're in and who you're talking to!""

I didn’t respond. Instead, I lifted my eyes to meet his, studying the face I’d once known so well, the face I had loved.

I knew he had never loved me, but the sting came from realizing that, for five years, he had never truly seen me as a part of his life.

Finally, I lowered my gaze, my voice soft but firm. ""I’ll leave this house sooner or later.""

His anger flared, his voice rising. ""Leave this house? You’ve been living off me all this time. How will you survive when you’re gone?""

Before I could reply, Kendall’s voice cut through the tension, lazy and dripping with sarcasm.

""Oh, the old woman’s throwing a tantrum again? What’s wrong? Getting old and can’t bear seeing Blake with younger, prettier women?""

“If it bothers you so much, why don’t you just strip off your clothes and crawl into Blake’s bed? But—""

She laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. ""With that face, no man would even blink.""

I slammed the spoon down onto the table, the sound sharp and sudden, like a match sparking something deep inside me.

Blake, who had been standing nearby, scoffed.

“Did Kendall say something wrong? Are you throwing another tantrum?”

I pressed my lips together, silently clearing away the half-eaten cereal before heading toward the kitchen.

Kendall’s triumphant voice floated from the dining room. “This is too good. Just stay obedient and play your part as the old housewife.”

“Enough, stop talking.”

Blake’s tone was scolding, but I could hear the underlying indulgence in his words.

I stared at the faucet, my thoughts drifting like a fog, so much so that I almost let the water overflow.

Then, a hand reached from behind and turned off the faucet.

“What are you lost in?”

The voice was too close, and when I turned, I found myself trapped in Blake’s intense, unreadable gaze.

I lowered my head again, focusing on the dishes in front of me.

“It’s nothing. I was just thinking about what comes next after the divorce.”

“Divorce?” Blake’s voice was laced with amusement as if I’d just told him a joke. “You’ve been with me since college, playing the dutiful housewife for five years. You’ve been cut off from the world. After we part ways, what will you even do?”



Chapter 2

“Housekeeper? Or just a maid cleaning up after everyone else?”

Those words, sharp and cruel, echoed in my mind, a refrain I had grown all too familiar with.

At first, they stung, cutting through me like a sharp blade. I found myself questioning, doubting if I really was as worthless as they painted me to be.

But five years ago, I was just as young and radiant as Kendall.

Five years ago, my world had shattered. In an instant, my parents were ripped from me in a tragic accident, leaving only me and my ten-year-old brother battling leukemia.

Desperation had taken root in me, and there was no choice but to drop out of school. I juggled part-time jobs, anything to afford his treatment.

The quickest way to earn money? A nightclub, where I ended up as an escort.

When a client humiliated me, a bottle crashing into my forehead, I thought I’d reached the bottom.

But then, a hand reached down from the darkness, pulling me out.

That was the first time I met Blake.

He had appeared like an angel in my life, lifting me from the flames of my misery.

And in that moment, he offered me a lifeline, an unexpected marriage contract.

Five million in exchange for five years of my life.

I agreed.

He said he needed a wife to quiet his family's expectations, someone with a spotless past, and that he didn’t want me out in public often, only allowing me to go out twice a week.

I agreed.

So, I spent those five years almost entirely inside this grand mansion.

As for Blake, I thought I loved him. I accepted this ""imprisonment,"" and, oddly, I even found a strange comfort in it.

I truly believed I could be his wife forever.

But he never touched me, never allowed me into his inner world.

Then, one day, when he wasn’t home, I couldn’t fight the temptation any longer. I sneaked into his bedroom, and that’s when the truth hit me like a slap in the face.

Blake had always had a lover.

Kendall.

His five-years-younger neighbor.

I had long grown numb to Blake’s endless parade of women. To me, they were nothing more than fleeting distractions. And I, in my quiet submission, held onto the title of ""Mrs. Wilson"" as if it were a badge of honor.

But yesterday changed everything. The moment I saw Kendall stroll into that bedroom, the one I had never been allowed to set foot in for five years, it hit me like a jolt of electricity. I finally understood. It was time to leave.

""Laura?"" Blake’s voice sliced through my thoughts, thick with impatience. ""What’s going on in that head of yours?""

""You called me useless, right?"" I replied coolly, turning to face him. ""Maybe it’s time I find a job. A housekeeper, a maid, "" I paused, locking eyes with him. ""Five years. I haven’t broken any laws. Should I just waste away here forever?""

Blake opened his mouth to speak, but before he could, Kendall stepped out, sliding into a pristine, brand-new couture dress. It was the same dress Blake had kept locked away, never worn, waiting for the right moment. And now it was on Kendall.

""I didn’t expect you to know my size so well,"" she purred, twirling in front of him. The fabric swirled gracefully around her, her smile gleaming. ""Do you think it looks good?""

Blake took Kendall's hand, his usual indifference replaced by something soft, almost affectionate.

""They look amazing,"" he said, nodding. ""As long as you love them, I’ll buy you anything.""

And then, right there in front of me, they kissed.

Kendall, her cheeks tinged with a hint of shyness, reluctantly pulled away from Blake. ""There are others here..."" she murmured, her eyes briefly flickering to me. ""Do you think the dress Blake chose for me looks good?""

The dress clung to Kendall’s form, a shimmering fabric that wrapped around her like it had been made for her, luxurious, radiant, and perfectly suited to her youthful charm.

I nodded; my voice was soft yet genuine as I met her gaze.

""They’re stunning.""



Chapter 3

Kendall froze, momentarily caught off guard by my words. She stood there, her gaze flickering as if weighing my intent.

Blake’s brows furrowed, though his expression remained as unreadable as ever.

Seizing the chance, I silently slipped away from the kitchen, feeling a sense of liberation with each step I took.

The divorce agreement would take effect in a week, and I had only that precious time to pack my life and leave this place behind.

Back in the bedroom, I scrolled through rental listings on my phone, absorbed in my thoughts, when Blake’s voice cut through the air.

""I need to head to the company for a bit. Kendall will stay here, so you’ll take care of her.""

I raised an eyebrow, the confusion creeping into my tone. ""Am I now a housekeeper? Is she so helpless that she needs me to babysit her?""

I had always bowed to his commands without a second thought, but today, something had shifted in me. I found myself questioning him, challenging his authority with every word.

His face darkened, his voice dropping low and menacing. ""Laura, don’t forget who’s been keeping you. You’re here because of me, and you’ll do as I say. Don’t push me.""

I swallowed the bitter taste of my pride, nodding with reluctant compliance, the weight of his words pressing heavily on my chest.

Before leaving, Blake issued one last warning, his voice low and edged with authority. ""Kendall’s young. You’re responsible for her while I’m gone. If anything happens, don’t think I’ll let you off easy.""

With those words lingering in the air, Blake leaned down to kiss Kendall’s forehead, a tender, possessive gesture before he strode out, the sound of the door clicking shut reverberating in the silence.

Now, with only Kendall and me left in the living room, the atmosphere shifted. She slouched against the sofa, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.

""I heard you’ve been married to Blake for five years,"" she said, her voice thick with amusement.

""Yes,"" I replied, my tone calm and measured, betraying nothing of the storm brewing inside me.

""But last night, he told me he’s never touched you!"" Kendall’s posture shifted as she tossed her hair back, revealing the dark mark on her neck. ""You must be twenty-six by now, still a …"" Her words hung in the air, sharp and probing.

She giggled, swaying gracefully like a delicate flower, before continuing, ""You must’ve heard us last night, right? Blake made sure you could hear everything from the next room. Oh, and I almost forgot, you’ve never experienced a man, have you? Especially someone as strong as Blake.""

Her laughter was almost too much to bear. ""What a shame. At your age, I doubt anyone would touch you, except for maybe you chasing after them, right?""

I furrowed my brows, disbelief creeping into my thoughts. I hadn’t expected Blake’s hidden rose to speak with such venom.

Calmly, I answered, ""Everyone lives their life differently. I don’t base my existence on any man.""

Kendall’s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced by a sneer. ""A woman who’s been living off a man, playing housewife for five years, probably has no room to talk, huh?""

I chose not to engage further, sitting down on the opposite end of the sofa as I continued my search for a place to rent.

Kendall couldn’t stand the sight of me remaining so calm and composed. It didn’t take long for her to start pushing my buttons, trying to boss me around.

The last time, she complained that the coffee I made was too cold and demanded I pour boiling water to fix it. Then, with the slyest of smiles, she pretended to spill it—most of the water splashed onto me while just a few drops landed on her wrist.

Her cry echoed through the room, sharp and dramatic.

""Blake, it hurts so much...""

By the time Blake rushed in, his face twisted in alarm, Kendall was already in full meltdown mode.

She showed him the small burn on her wrist, and he fussed over it for a moment before turning to me, his anger flaring.

With a forceful slap, he sent me crashing to the ground.

""Didn’t I tell you to take care of Kendall? Is this how you do it?!""

His voice was cold with fury. ""If even the smallest mark appears on her, I’ll make sure you suffer ten times worse.""

Without another word, Blake grabbed Kendall and rushed her off to the hospital, leaving me kneeling on the floor.

I lifted my nightgown, the red welts on my thighs already burning with the sting of the water.



Chapter 4

I lowered my gaze, the world before me slipping into a haze. Large, hot tears splashed onto my swollen knees.

The pain from the wound was sharp, but it barely scratched the surface compared to the ache in my heart.

I hailed a taxi, the loneliness in the backseat a cruel reminder of what I was leaving behind.

As the doctor tended to my injury, she muttered about the patient in the next room, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""These girls today are just so spoiled,"" she sighed. ""A tiny burn, barely the size of a fingernail, and her boyfriend called the director. He threatened to shut down the whole hospital if she got a scar...""

She paused, a wistful tone taking over. ""You don’t get it. That’s what it means to be loved. I envy her. She has it all—handsome, rich, devoted. She’s got a man who’d do anything for her...""

I stared down at the grotesque burn on my thigh, an involuntary sneer twisting my lips.

Blake was indeed the perfect man from the outside—handsome, wealthy, and all-consuming. But what did it all mean without love?

After the doctor finished, I sat on a bench outside the ward, trying to steady myself, lost in thought.

Then, Blake and Kendall appeared, walking toward me.

When Blake saw the bandages on my leg, his frown deepened.

""You got hurt too? Why didn’t you say anything?""

Before I could answer, he continued, his tone judgmental. ""Well, that’s your fault. You can’t even carry a cup of water properly. Luckily, Kendall didn’t get hurt. Otherwise...""

Blake, ever the picture of cold indifference, stood there, his arms wrapped tightly around Kendall.

Kendall leaned sweetly into him, her voice soft with feigned innocence. ""Don’t blame her, Blake. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have been so selfish, asking her to take care of me...""

Blake’s arms tightened around Kendall protectively as if he were shielding her from any harm.

""Don’t be silly. I’ve raised her for five years. Even if you treat her like a servant, it’s still your responsibility.""

""As long as you’re happy, you can make her do anything,"" Kendall added, her voice dripping with sweetness.

With that, they left, walking off as if nothing had happened.

Not once did Blake care to ask about my injury, never once sparing a thought for the pain I was in.

I lowered my head, my limbs too weak to move. I tried a few times, but I couldn’t find the strength to walk.

""Miss, would you like me to contact your husband?"" the nurse asked gently, her voice full of concern.

I watched them disappear down the hallway, and a bitter smile curled on my lips.

""No. We’ll be divorced soon,"" I murmured, my voice barely audible.

A week passed, and still no sign of Blake.

He had taken Kendall to New York, leaving me behind in this empty villa.

Each day, Kendall sent me photos—pictures of them embracing beneath the Statue of Liberty, kissing amid the bustling crowd of Times Square, kneeling before a sky ablaze with fireworks.

There were too many to count.

The final night before the five-year mark, I hid beneath the covers, alone in the vast emptiness of the villa.

I flipped through the photos, my hands trembling, each image a sharp reminder of the love I would never have.

By the time I reached the last one, my tears fell uncontrollably, slipping through my fingers like sand.

That night, I finally pulled away the light that had once warmed me, casting me into a cold, unfamiliar darkness.

When the divorce agreement took effect, Blake still hadn’t returned home.

I never got the chance to say a proper goodbye.

With a heavy heart, I packed up everything that was mine, placing the divorce agreement neatly on the coffee table.

I took one last, lingering glance at the villa that had held me captive for five years, its walls now nothing more than cold memories, before walking away without a single look back.

From that moment on, I would be free.

A free soul, no longer shackled by the chains of anyone or anything.

It was half a month later when Blake called, just as I was holding an invitation from the renowned designer Solomon Jennings.



Chapter 5

For five long years, Blake never let me step beyond the walls of the villa. Trapped in my gilded cage, I poured my soul into sketching jewelry designs.

During that time, I collaborated on several occasions with Solomon’s studio, and a few pieces from their latest collection bore my signature touch.

Over the years, Solomon had extended countless invitations for me to join his team, but bound by my contract with Blake, I had always declined.

This time, when the offer came, I finally said yes.

The phone rang not long after, and Blake’s icy tone cut through the line.

""Where are you?""

His voice dripped with entitlement. ""Didn’t I make myself clear? I don’t want my wife parading around for everyone to see. Get back here. Kendall is moving into the villa, and you’re supposed to take care of her.""

Take care of her?

I let out a dry laugh and replied as coolly as ever. ""What’s the matter, Blake? Did Kendall lose her hands or her legs? Or is the great Wilson family suddenly too poor to hire a nanny?""

Blake’s fury crackled through the phone like a storm.

""Who gave you the right to talk to me like that?"" His voice was sharp, brimming with contempt. ""Get back here right now, or I’ll freeze your card! Let’s see how long you last in Seattle without me!""

The call ended abruptly, his anger lingering in the silence.

I couldn’t help but chuckle as I tossed my phone onto the couch. His threats, once suffocating, now felt almost laughable.

Riker Brown, my brother and confidant, picked up my phone and glanced at the screen, his frown deepening. ""Have you made up your mind? Once the divorce is final, there’s no turning back.""

He paused, his tone softening. ""Are you really okay with that?""

Over the years, Riker had been my rock, the only person I could trust with the truths I didn’t dare admit to anyone else. Even the hidden feelings I had buried deep in my heart were no secret to him.

Just then, my phone buzzed with a new message. I hesitated before checking it, and there it was, another photo from Kendall.

In the picture, Blake was on one knee, his smile radiant as he slipped a dazzling diamond ring onto Kendall’s finger. Her laughter, frozen in time, seemed to mock me.

The image hit me like a punch to the chest. My heart, long numbed by years of neglect, suddenly felt as if it had been shattered into a thousand pieces. Each jagged edge tore at me, making every breath feel like a struggle.

For five long years, I had waited—waited for something I never dared to hope for. Yet, with nothing more than a flick of her finger, she had it all handed to her on a silver platter.

“At peace with it,” I murmured, shutting off my phone as a hollow smile tugged at my lips.

This was nothing new. I had anticipated it all along.

From the very beginning, I had known what this was, a transaction, plain and simple.

Time and money exchanged like currency, and with the contract finally reaching its end, it was my turn to walk away.

The next day, Blake called relentlessly. I watched his name flash on my screen over and over but didn’t answer even once.

When his calls were met with silence, his anger came through in a text instead.

\[If you don’t come back now, then don’t bother coming back at all!\]

I almost laughed at the irony. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to remind him to read the divorce agreement waiting neatly on the coffee table, but before I could send anything, another message appeared, this time from Kendall.

The photo loaded slowly, but the moment it appeared, it was like a slap to the face. There she was, draped in a pristine white wedding dress, her radiant smile glowing as she leaned into Blake’s arms. The pictures kept coming, photo after photo of their apparent happiness.

Wedding photos.

My chest tightened, but I forced myself to scroll through the messages that followed.

\[We’re already preparing for the wedding. So when is the intruder planning to leave the Wilson family?\]

\[If you behave yourself, maybe I’ll even let you attend the wedding. Wouldn’t that be fun?\]

\[Jealous, aren’t you? He never even thought about planning a wedding for you. But the moment I mentioned it, he couldn’t wait to make it happen.\]

Each word cut deeper than the last. My hands trembled, and with every message, the pain buried deep within me surfaced like a tidal wave. I couldn’t take any more.

Without reading the rest, I blocked her number and set the phone down.

After doing that, I opened my email and finally replied to Solomon, confirming the time to join his studio.

October 23rd.

The day Blake and Kendall tied the knot.

He embraced his happiness with open arms, while I silently vowed to vanish from his world forever.

At the venue, Kendall was glowing, her laughter echoing through the room as she meticulously chose her reception dress. She radiated joy, a picture-perfect bride basking in the love and adoration surrounding her.

From across the room, Blake watched her. This was everything he had ever dreamed of, standing on the brink of marrying the woman he had always claimed to love. Yet, beneath the surface, a shadow lingered. His heart felt heavy, veiled by an unshakable mist that left him restless as if a piece of the puzzle was missing.

Unable to resist, he pulled out his phone and opened the chat with me. The screen lit up with his last message from the day before, a sharp warning that if I didn’t return home, he’d cut me off financially.

There was no reply. Just silence.

For five years, I had been the perfect picture of compliance, never once defying his authority.

In all that time, I had never stayed away this long.

Irritated, Blake fired off another message.

\[What childish tantrum are you throwing now?\]

But as he hit send, a glaring red exclamation mark greeted him. The message hadn’t gone through.

I had blocked him.

Fury surged through him as he tried calling me, only to be met with the cold realization that his calls had been blocked as well.

What game was she playing?

Without wasting a second, he grabbed his phone and barked orders to his assistant.

“Freeze Laura’s supplementary card immediately and restrict all her spending!”

Without access to money, he thought, she and her brother wouldn’t last long in this city. They’d come crawling back.

There was a brief silence on the other end before the assistant hesitantly spoke.

“Sir, for the past five years, she hasn’t used her supplementary card even once.”

Blake froze.

I used to be a mafia princess. Now? I’m just the help. I gave up my empire for love. Walked away from the Rossini name, the gold, the power—all for one promise Edmund made me on my eighteenth birthday.

“One day, baby, I’ll take you around the world.”

Thirty years later, I’m invisible in my own home. Mocked by my grandsons. Ignored by my son. And replaced—body and soul—by my perfect, venomous sister-in-law, Elizabeth.

I knew. Everyone knew. Elizabeth was Edmund’s mistress. But I kept my mouth shut. I believed—foolishly—that Edmund would change.

Then came my forty-eighth birthday.

I dared to ask Edmund for one thing—a cruise. Just a simple cruise.

He brushed me off like I was nothing.

But the truth hit me like a bullet.

I found their cruise tickets. Edmund and Elizabeth, sailing away with my son, my daughter-in-law, and my grandsons—all celebrating Elizabeth’s birthday.

I was left behind by all of them.

I smiled, bitter and cold. Grabbed my suitcase. Booked the next flight back to my real home.

Back to the dangerous daughter of a mafia king—the one Edmund always feared and the alliance he’s been desperate to control.

That was the moment I found my voice—clear. Calm. Sharper than a blade.

“The divorce papers are waiting for you.”

There was a stunned pause, then Edmund’s voice cracked through the line, “You’re joking. You can’t divorce me.”

I laughed. Cold. Cruel. Cutting through the silence like a knife.

“I can.”

\--

I was supposed to be the ghost in the house.

I never asked for jewels. Never asked for roses. Just one promise. One promise.

A cruise.

Edmund had said it back when he still had a soul. “One day, when we're rich,” he whispered into my hair, “I'll take you around the world, baby. Just us.”

That was before the money. Before the empire. Before I became his wife in name, and his maid in practice.

And today’s my 48th birthday. No one ever greeted me. No cake, no candles.

And I thought maybe—just maybe—it could be mine.

I brought it up after dinner. He was still in his chair, polishing his pistol with that same old cloth like it was a sacred ritual. The flatscreen TV was playing some old Western no one was watching. My heart was pounding harder than it should’ve been.

“Do you remember what you told me… on my 18th birthday?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t look up. “Which part?”

“That we’d travel. See the world together. You said once the business settled and our boy was grown… we’d go. On a cruise. Just us.”

“Are you out of your mind?” Edmund chuckled, “You think you deserve a cruise? Look at you. You look like a bamboo stick. One gust and you're gone. You think the captain’s gonna see you and roll out a red carpet? No, Doris. He’s gonna think you’re hauling walking bacteria on board.”

""But today is—""

""Today's what?"" He finally looked at me. His face was older, heavier now. “You’re not young anymore. The world’s not kind to women like you out there. You're not like Elizabeth.”

There it was. The name that always hovered between us.

Elizabeth. My sister-in-law. His brother’s widow. Slim, golden-haired, always dressed like she stepped out of a fashion magazine. She judged me with her eyes every time we were in the same room. Edmund never corrected her.

“She’s younger,” he continued, “travels for business. Makes appearances for the family. She’s part of the image. But you—you’ve always been the one behind the scenes. That’s where you shine. The house. The family. You keep things running.”

Behind me, the twins were laughing. My grandson.

“Yeah, Ma, you look like a skeleton in a funeral dress,” said Lyle, smirking.

“Smells like old mop water and something foul,” Nash added, pinching his nose.

They burst into snorting laughter. No one stopped them. No one ever did.

Lester, our pride and failure, leaned against the fridge and shouted across the kitchen, “Hey, Ma. Wash my clothes, yeah? My wife is busy right now. And bleach the white ones this time, unless you wanna ruin another set.”

“I’m not your maid,” I murmured.

“What was that?” he snapped.

“I said I’m not—”

He threw a half-empty soda can at the floor. “Then what the heck are you? Because you sure as heck ain’t doing anything else in this house! You don’t bring money in.”

My blood boiled.

“I raised you,” I snapped. “Fed you. Stayed up when you had fevers. I’ve been working since before you were born.”

“Well, maybe you should’ve worked on smelling better. You smell like a rotten corpse,” one of the twins piped.

“Yeah,” snickered his brother, Nash. “It’s embarrassing just seeing her. Our classmates said she’s so ugly, they get scared when she shows up to pick us up. Like some cast member from The Walking Dead.”

They both burst into giggles. Then Edmund grabbed his pistol off the mantel, inspecting it like it mattered more than me.

“We got money, Doris,” he muttered. “You know that. But I’m not wasting it on some useless help. You’re here. You got two hands. Why on earth would I hire a maid when you’re the woman of the house?”

The woman of the house. That was whatever he called me.

But I didn’t own anything. Not a car. Not a card.

Every cent I needed, I had to beg for. And if I asked for more? He’d demand an itemized receipt. Penny by penny.



\---



That night, when the noise died down and the family disappeared into their rooms, I walked to the bedroom, pulled out the old red suitcase from the closet. The one he bought me in Naples before our wedding.

Before the world twisted into what it is now.

I looked down at my hands. They didn’t look like mine anymore. Lined. Broken. Tired.

I used to be someone. A Rossini. The daughter of a mafia king. The girl born with gold in her mouth and fire in her spine. But I gave that up for love. I disowned myself from my family, thinking Edmund’s love was enough.

And now?

Now I was just the ghost in the house.

No kingdom. No crown. I have enough already. Maybe, leaving this family is the best birthday I could give to myself.



Chapter 2

The next morning…

I heard about the dinner from Lyle—he blurted it out while stuffing potato chips in his mouth.

“Elizabeth rented the whole top floor of the Luciana Hotel! Fancy, huh? Dad says she booked it just for us. Big celebration.”

I paused mid-mop. “Us?”

Nash answered, “You’re not coming, Ma. Grandpa said you're... not up for it. I mean, look at you.""

Not up for it... Like I was sick. Or senile. Or something to be pitied.

By sunset, the house was empty. Edmund had shaved. Wore the cologne he only touched for business deals and funerals. He stood tall in his navy suit, fixing Lyle’s and Nash collar like a proud grandfather, and Lester wore his best suit.

“Remember,” Edmund said to them, “Elizabeth’s doing this because she loves us. She's family.”

“We know, grandpa. That's why we love Elizabeth more than Grandma Doris.” they answered in unison.

And then, nothing. No goodbye. No we’ll bring you something. Just the sound of the front door closing like a coffin lid.

The quiet afterward was insulting. A hollow that screamed louder than any slap.

I stood in the middle of the hallway, in my house slippers, holding a basket of unfolded laundry. My stomach growled. I hadn’t cooked. What for?

Out of spite, I turned on the TV. They were on the news.

A live segment from the Luciana Hotel.

Cameras panned across crystal chandeliers and violin quartets. There they were—Elizabeth in her fur shawl. Edmund beside her. My son and his wife smiling like politicians. Lyle and Nash sipping soda in a tiny tuxedo.

The reporter called it: “A private Morroco gathering—Elizabeth’s homecoming. The family behind one of the largest shipping fortunes in the country.”

I was not in the shot. Not in the credits.

Not even in the whispers.

They toasted champagne. I sipped stale coffee.

They laughed under golden light. I wiped a smudge off the glass door.

And just when I thought it couldn’t cut deeper, the camera caught a brief, brutal moment:

Elizabeth leaned toward Edmund, whispered something, and they both laughed.

My son chuckled too. I didn’t know what she said. But I knew it was about me.

I felt it in my teeth.

\*\*\*

Hours later, just after midnight, the door opened again. I turned. Hoped, stupidly, it might be my son. But no—it was them.

Elizabeth’s heels clicked confidently across the marble as she half-carried Edmund, drunk and swaying, into the house. His tie hung loose, lips pink from too much wine. Eyes bleary, glazed.

“Oh, Doris,” Elizabeth said with a smirk, spotting me standing by the staircase like a ghost. “Didn’t think you’d be awake.”

She steered Edmund toward the hall, her arm looped through his like a bride on her wedding day. “Lester and the twins are staying at my penthouse. Too tired to come back. But Edmund… well, he can’t sleep in strange beds. Poor thing.”

A lie.

I knew it.

She came here only to shove the truth down my throat.

“I told him not to worry,” she continued sweetly. “I’d bring him home. Take care of him. It’s what family does, right?”

Then she reached into her tote and tossed a plastic container at my feet. It bounced once, landed near the rug.

“Leftovers,” she said. “Go eat, sister-in-law. You look like a sickly little stick. You should really take better care of yourself. Bet you weight like 30kls.""

I didn’t move.

My fingers curled into fists at my side.

“I’ll put Edmund to bed,” she added with a sly smile. “I know you two don’t share a room anymore. He told me. Said your side of the bed always smells like disappointment.”

I took one step forward. Just one. My palm twitched. Slapping her would’ve felt good. Almost holy. But what for?

My heart was already cracking in my chest like ice under boots. And the real punishment was in what I saw next—

Edmund, drunk and limp, smiled at her like she’d hung the moon. “Elizabeth’s so pretty,” he mumbled. “Smells like peaches. Mmm. Doris smells like dishwater and arguments.”

They climbed the stairs together. I stayed behind. Frozen. Shaking. She laughed once more before they disappeared down the hall.

And I realized—

They didn’t kill me.

They just replaced me.

\*\*\*

I waited.

Not because I cared. Not because I hoped. But because I needed to know.

The clock ticked past one. Then two. Still no sign of her. The upstairs lights stayed on. No footsteps on the stairs. No sound of a door closing. Only muffled laughter. Then silence.

I sat on the edge of the couch in my robe, untouched coffee cooling on the table. The house smelled of lemon cleaner and betrayal.

Maybe she fell asleep in the guest room. Maybe she just—

A thump.

Then another.

Not heavy. Rhythmic. Too… intimate.

My blood chilled.

I rose, like something pulled me forward by the throat. I climbed the stairs, slow as a prayer. The hallway stretched like a graveyard path. The door to our bedroom—his bedroom now—was cracked open.

And I saw.

Elizabeth, unclothed, straddling Edmund. Her red nails dug into his chest like claws. Her head tilted back in a mess of curls. And Edmund—my husband, my life partner of 30 years—grunting beneath her like an animal.

My legs stopped working. My mouth went dry.

She cried out loud, shameless, her voice like a blade across my spine.

“Ohh… Brother-in-law—don’t stop. Fill me. Ruin me like she never let you.”

Edmund murmured, “You’re perfect. Not like her. You’re everything, Lizzy—”

I ran.

I didn’t cry. I ran. Straight to the downstairs bathroom and vomited until my ribs cramped.

The sound of them still echoed in my ears, louder than sirens.

“Harder—make me forget she ever existed!”

“You were always the one, Lizzy. Always.”

He was fifty. She was forty-five.

And still, they had no shame. Not even a sliver of decency. They weren't just in-laws. They weren’t even just lovers. They were conspirators. Twisting the knife slowly—together.

I stayed on the cold tile floor, knees pressed to my chest, my body shaking in waves I couldn’t stop. It wasn’t about the intimacy. It was about being erased.

Replaced.

They didn’t just want to humiliate me. They wanted to watch me rot in the house I built. But a woman who survives this?

She doesn’t stay on the bathroom floor. She remembers. She plans. She learns how to haunt quietly.



Chapter 3

I woke before the birds.

No alarm. No reason. Just the reflex of a woman trained to serve everyone but herself.

No tears. No ache. Just breath. In, out. Hollow.

I wiped my face with a damp cloth. Lip balm. Hair tied low. Not beautiful—just functional. Alive enough to pass.

Then I reached under the bed.

The red suitase was there. I dragged it out, unzipped it two inches. Cash from quiet sales—empanadas, lumpia—no questions asked. Passport, maiden name. A photo of me at eighteen. Smiling. Bold. Untouched by the slow erosion of marriage. I zipped it shut.

Downstairs, the kitchen was still dark. I boiled water, cracked eggs, sliced bread. My hands moved on their own. Stir. Season. Flip. Feed.

I was pouring coffee when I heard them behind me—bare feet against the hardwood. Her giggle first. Then his laugh.

They slid into the kitchen like a couple on a honeymoon. Elizabeth wore one of Edmund’s button-downs, half open. Her legs bare. Hair tousled like she’d just rolled off him, which she probably did. Edmund looked freshly showered, like their night together was some kind of baptism.

“Coffee, Doris,” she said, yawning like a cat in sunlight. “Make his strong, mine half and half. You know how he likes it.”

I handed them their mugs without a word.

Edmund didn’t even glance at me. Just sipped. Then said, “Bacon and omelet, Doris. Lizzy loves it the way I do. None of that salty mess you used to make. She's watching her figure—not that it shows, huh?”

Elizabeth chuckled and leaned against the counter like she owned it. “Not everyone wants to look like a stick wrapped in sadness, sweetie.”

I smiled. Not out of kindness. Just strategy.

Smile. Just smile. You’ve cooked for enemies before.

I cracked more eggs. Let the oil sizzle. Pretended I didn’t hear them talking about the night. About the penthouse. About how soft the sheets were. About how Edmund snored less when he was “with her.” About how my shampoo made him sneeze. They ate like I was the maid. Talked like I wasn’t real.

Then the front door flung open.

“Family’s here!” Lester’s voice boomed like a sitcom dad. “Let the party begin!”

Loisa followed behind him, heels clicking against the tiles, holding up a new designer purse like it was the Holy Grail. “Mom, look! Elizabeth gave me this! Can you believe it? Real leather! Italian! And these earrings? Gifted. God, she’s such a giver.”

She twirled like a child. Like she didn’t already own closets full of things Lester bought for her. Not that he ever bought me a single scarf.

Behind them, the twins stormed in with that careless energy only teenagers have. Lyle was wearing sunglasses indoors. Nash had something massive covered in brown paper.

Loisa laughed again, too loud. “Didn’t you hear? Lizzie gave us the whole penthouse. We slept like royals. You should’ve seen the tub. Bigger than our bedroom.”

“Oh, and the view,” Lester chimed in, opening a bottle of wine without asking. “From the 36th floor? Breathtaking. Sun hits the windows just right. Like a painting. Like—perfect.”

It was nine in the morning.

Nash and Lyle dragged their ‘surprise’ into the living room and tore off the cover. It was a giant, glossy print of the family, taken at the Luciana Hotel gala. Everyone dressed like aristocrats. Posed like nobility. Elizabeth in the middle. My sons beside her. Edmund’s hand resting on her body.

I wasn’t in the picture.

“Look, Grandma!” Nash said with a smirk. “Don’t we look like a real family here?”

Lyle added without blinking, “Too bad you weren’t there. Oh wait—yeah. You were left behind. Guess you looked too much like our maid.”

The room exploded with laughter. Even Edmund. Even my son. Even Loisa, wiping tears from her eyes.

Elizabeth just sipped her coffee and said cheerfully, “Don’t worry, Doris. I’ll leave some of my old dresses in your closet. And some perfume. They’re a little tight on me now, but I think you can squeeze in.”

Edmund chuckled, not even looking at me. “You can dress a corpse in Versace—it’s still a corpse. She still smells like disappointment.”

Loisa practically screamed laughing. Nash and Lyle clapped each other like it was a roast battle.

And me?

I picked up their dirty plates. I washed them one by one. I stared out the window at the neighbor’s lemon tree, blooming.

For a back story: currently TTC baby 2 for 11 months. Had baby 1 first try. All tests came back normal for me, but I do have a short luteal phase with 8/9/10dpo spotting. 7dpo progesterone was 10.7, 8dpo was 10.2, 10dpo crashed to 3 and spotting started like every cycle. I brought this up to Dr Browning and he shrugged it off as no big deal. Also had a chemical pregnancy in March. I had a clockwork 14 day luteal phase with my daughter with no spotting… this only started after she was born. AMH is 24 and all other numbers are optimal. My husbands results were all normal but was told morphology is 0% (despite him being very fit, working out 5 days a week, no smoking, no weed, rarely drinks, eats clean, no coffee). Dr Browning gave no explanation to how we can fix this or give suggestions… just told us to do IVF. That can’t be the only reason, right? He didn’t even want to do another sample to confirm.

1l3mqqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l3mqqz/wild_ride_relationship_issues/,Wild ride ! Relationship issues,"Sorry long read and tons of run on sentences and poor grammar I was going fast but AITAH?…so I had plans to bring my children to meet up at my gf’s sons baseball game but right before I spoke to a buddy who works at the gym she goes to and I asked if he knew her. He told me he kinda recognizes her and thought she was married because he sees her with a dude all the time.I trust her but then I thought maybe she could be hiding other things because a few times I found she was bringing an alcoholic drink in a to-go cup to my house and to other places like her kids sports games but she told me it was juice until I took a sip when she wasn’t around .I sat on that for awhile and didn’t bring it up but with the gym thing and this thing it made me wonder what she was hiding .i decide to bring it up as I’m getting ready to go meet her and the kids at the game via text .she said she used to go with her ex fiancé to that gym and she then proceeds to say she wasn’t hiding her drinking I never asked her all those times what was in the cup and the time I did ask she told me juice she meant juice as in “cocktail?” And she’s sorry that I took it wrong so it’s not hiding because the thermos cup was in the open and she constitutes hiding as putting it somewhere hidden and not in plain site so I got pretty mad and decided not to go as we argued via text and she defended herself over and over saying things like .she then tells me I’m cheating on her because I follow semi nude woman on instagram ..I also hide my nicotine vape from her ..and I abandoned her and the kids by not going to the game.i admit I did not handle the situation great and should have thought about the kids because they were excited to see me and my kids ,I also should have not hidden my nicotine vape I then said I’m willing to unfollow anyone if it makes her happy and I do think it’s childish but she refuses to admit any wrong doing for it and refuses to admit she hid anything from me because the coffee thermos cup was in the open …I know I shouldn’t have let her kids down and feel bad for that i also shouldnt have brought the issue up in text but with the situation as a whole AITAH here ?

1l3mq3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l3mq3i/i_work_on_death_row_inmate_728931_wont_die_part_1/,I work on death row. Inmate 7289-31 won’t die. (Part 1),"I still remember my first execution like it was yesterday. A 50-something year old man who shot his 2 kids and wife for whatever reason. The judge decided the world was better off without him and sent him to the gas chamber. I was 25 when I watched him die.I remember going to confession the next day, begging God on my hands and knees for forgiveness.  It's been about 30 years since then. 

I work on D block at Harrison State Prison, near El Paso in Texas. It's a  very old prison, built before the first world war. It hardly gets any funding either, the meals suck, the uniforms still have stripes on them, and only in the last 5 years the death row upgrade to lethal injection. I'm willing to bet that you could hammer the wall with a spoon and it would fall apart, yet somehow we haven't had an escape in over forty years.

Daryl Hoss came to us in 2013. He was a strange man, about six and a half feet tall, skinny, and pale. His eyes seemed to be perpetually bloodshot and he was always sweating. But despite how offputting he was, we still gave him the standard procedure. We searched every cavity of his body, shaved him clean, threw him in the shower, and put him in his cell. The numbers stitched into his uniform was 7289-31.

Judge Jacob Hower had sentenced him to die on the lethal injection gurney on August 15th. He had killed four hikers with a shotgun and stolen their money and clothes before tossing their bodies in a river. State patrol had picked him up near Fort Hancock trying to cross the border. After finding the money, clothes, and about seven pounds of cocaine in the trunk they packed him up and shipped him off to the Hudspeth county courthouse for sentencing. 

He had a large tattoo across his back that read ¨Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed¨. A bible verse, Genesis nine verse six. The tattoo looked off on his skin, almost like it didn't fit right, or did not belong. Nonetheless we paid it no mind.

Daryl never slept. Not once. He always stood at the bars of his cell, just looking out into the corridor. Whenever we would make the rounds he would just stare at us. One night, me and Carl Hiltmore, one of three other yards besides myself, were on shift. He just kept standing there, staring at Carl. And I mean he seemingly could not take his eyes off of him, and we noticed.

He went up to the bars of the cell and banged his nightstick on the metal, but the man didn't even flinch. Carl was only five feet and six inches tall, so this guy towered over him. His pale skin was made even whiter by the fluorescent lights and it casted shadows on his face. His mouth hung open and he drooled. 

¨You best keep to yer darn self,¨ he said sternly, ¨I catch you lookin´ again I´m puttin´ you in the hole.¨ The man again said nothing, and he didn't even move. Carl backed up slightly. 

¨Alright, lights out.¨ he said in a quieter tone of voice. The lights went out and the corridor was nearly pitch black. At the end of the call was a room that Me and Carl would spend the night in. There was a television, a microwave, a coffee maker, etcetera. Before I walked in I looked back. The man's eyes looked back at me, glowing red in the light like a cat's eyes, or like in the flash of an old picture from the eighties. His body was hidden in the darkness, and It just creeped me out. Quickly I shut the door and went in.

August 15th rolled around without any other incident, other than the creepy nature of the fella and the constant staring. Eight o'clock sharp tonight. We spent the entire day getting ready, making sure the straps on the lethal injection gurney were good and in place, making sure the cardiogram worked, that the IV tubes were properly hooked up, all that stuff. 

He spoke with the prison chaplain for about an hour, got no last meal (Texas doesn't do that anymore) and finally we led him into the chamber. He seemed to get taller when we let him out in handcuffs; his skin had gotten paler somehow. The prison shirt hung on his thin frame and his wrists were small enough that the handcuffs had to be tightened all the way, and even then they were still a little loose. His veins bulged through his skin which was strangely leathery and cold. His eyes were still bloodshot and his face was guant and long. 

¨How in the hell is this guy alive,¨ I heard Carl mutter under his breath. I ignored the comment and when 7:40 rolled around we led him to the chamber, the warden and the prison chaplain tailing not too far behind.

We strapped him down to the gurney with surprising ease, though his hands, wrists, ankles and feet hung off the gurney. His chest hardly rose and fell and we wondered if he was breathing. He was, the warden had concluded that after putting his hand right belieth his nose and feeling the air coming in and out. The cardiogram machine picked up a heartbeat, and since his veins were so prominent we had no issue hooking up the IV tubes. 

7:50 rolled around, and the curtains were opened into the viewing room. About a dozen people were in there; a few people from the press, the district attorney and a couple other lawyers, a few county officials, and the families of the people that this man had killed. 

7:55 came. ¨Daryl Hoss,¨ Carl started. ¨Your condemnation of death by the state of Texas is about to be served. If there anything you would like to say before this sentence is executed?¨

His eyes shot open, red, dry, and bloodshot and his head tilted back and looked directly at Daryl. A creepy grin spread across his leathery face. This startled him and he swallowed hard in an attempt to hide his extreme discomfort. 

¨Alright then,¨ he continued. ¨May your passing be quick, may the families be brought closure, and may God have mercy on your soul.¨

8:00 on the dot. Carl pushed the button to inject the first chemical, which knocked him out. The second one causes full muscle paralysis, and finally the last chemical stops the heart. Carl pushed that button, the liquid was pumped in his veins, and the cardiogram flatlines. The curtains were drawn, the chaplain said a prayer, and the body was wheeled out, and we thought that was just that: the end of the road.

We didn't find out that he was alive until the next day. The first time in any of our careers, warden included. He spent a little while, probably about a week in the ICU before they put him right back in his cell. Somehow he looked even more dead than he did before, but he went right back to standing at the bars with his mouth open, drooling.

That night it was just me and Carl on night duty. The lights were off and we were hanging out in the room, playing cards and drinking some sodas. Every once in a while I glanced out and saw his glowing beady eyes looking right at us. I tried not to look, but knowing that he was staring at me through the little plexiglass window made me deeply uncomfortable. 

¨What´s on yer mind?¨ Carl finally asked. I looked up at him and shook my head. ¨Nothin’, nothin’.¨”He squinted at me but shrugged and laid his winning hand on the table, grinned, and took the twenty or so crumpled up dollars from the middle of the table and stuffed them in his pocket. 

¨Alright I'm about to wet myself, ‘scuse me.¨ he said as he stood up and walked out into the pitch black hallway. I chuckled and shook my head and took a sup from my bottle. The television played some news reports about another shooting. I had a feeling that we would hear about this guy from the judge in the not too distant future.

Fifteen minutes passed. Then twenty. Then thirty. Carl was nowhere to be seen. I opened the door and peered out into the hallway.

¨Hey Carl? You good out there?¨ I called. 

The only response I got was the gaze of Daryl's eyes. I shuddered and closed the door, embarrassed at my fear. Prison guards don't carry guns, only the guys in the guard towers did. We also usually didn't have nightsticks, the guys in the general population didn´t. But since death row is typically pretty quiet I guess  they thought we could have them. So I had that, plus a small can of pepper spray.  

Deciding to rip the metaphorical band-aid off, I opened the door and charged into the block, right past the eyes and to the bathroom down the corridor and to the left. The lights were out, so I used my flashlight to illuminate it. 

¨Carl?¨ I whispered.

I backed out of the bathroom, the silence replaced by the raspy breathing of Daryl in the cell. I glanced back, the eyes had disappeared. Maybe he had finally gone to bed, I thought. 

I used my flashlight and scanned around for Carl. I called over on my radio that I didn't know where he was, and a response cackled through about how nobody else had seen him. 

The door to the janitorial closet stood in front of me now. I grabbed the round door handle and it came away wet and red. I looked on the floor and a small amount of blood was smeared on the floor.

I ripped open the door and was met with Carl´s body looking right back at me. 

He looked like he had been there a hundred years. His body was dry, shriveled and, and stiff. He looked like a mummy, but his uniform still looked fine. He clutched his nightstick in his bony fingers, his head was thrown back and his eyes were deeply sunken in and his jaw hung wide open, his teeth brown and falling out. His bones were exposed over his tight and mummified skin. 

I stifled a scream and backed up, losing my footing and falling backward. My flashlight fell to the floor and rolled over to illuminate Daryl looking right at me. His eyes glowed in the light and he smiled a toothless grin. He was sticking his long, guant head out of the prison bars. I looked at him, then back at the corpse, then back at him.

They looked strangely...similar.

We’re not here to script your post. We want your voice and your dog’s personality to come through.

For context I work a seasonal contract job in the Television Industry where I work 3 months and then have 3 months off, and so on. I’m currently in the 3 months off period in between work right now. This means I have literally nothing to do for the next 3 months. I don’t have any savings because I use the money I make when I’m working to pay my way through my 3 months break. I have diagnosed ADHD, depression and anxiety. I have pretty bad social anxiety too. I live in a big city in Australia.

I wake up every morning and make a coffee and then just sit in bed. I can’t remember what I used to do for fun and don’t know what people do with their spare time. I just sit in bed and watch TV or play video games and then do a couple of chores, but I’m so bored of everything. My partner will get home from work around 4pm and make dinner because she loves to cook, and then we’ll have dinner together and hopefully spend some time together watching a movie or something.

I just don’t know how to fill my day. I’m just sitting here and can’t think of anything I’d like to do. I feel like a vegetable just laying in bed all day but I truly just don’t know how to find something to do that I will enjoy. I have a gym membership but haven’t gone in weeks because I’ve lost motivation. I rapidly gained about 35kg in covid lockdowns and am struggling to lose that weight and get fit again, and I feel really self conscious at the gym being so overweight.

I’ve tried knitting, ceramics and drawing but got bored of them all pretty quickly. I just get so depressed and frustrated because I just don’t know how people find joy or fun in their days. I don’t have any savings or money to spend on expensive hobbies or to travel etc. I can barely afford paying rent and groceries at the moment.

I know this is such a first world problem, but I really need help. What are some hobbies people have that make them happy and take up time? Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.",2,1749086232.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

So the thing is I am staying far away in a flat/PG with a very hectic schedule of college. When I say hectic I mean 8 hours of attending lectures that too sitting with our back straight. 

I am planning to spare 1 hour from this schedule for exercise everyday. 

I have some questions I would like to get answers from the professional/working individuals here 

1. My exercise will basically include calisthenics with no pull up exercises 
[ forms of squats/ Pushups/ Core exercises ] 

2. I don't have a pull up bar nor will the owner allow me to mount one on his wall. Any exercise you could recommend for instead ? 

3. About diet, I will eating regular Indian lunch/dinner ( Dal chawal sabji roti )  from the college canteen  problem is my protein intake. 
Will it be okay to drink protein supplement whenever I exercise ? 
[ Age 26 ; Weight : 68-69 ; Height : 5'10 ] 

4. Along with this I need to study and stay awake. So I can't be sleepy or tired. So please suggest any supplements I know caffeine/coffee is one but is it okay to take it eeveryday ? 

Or I believe BCAAA or ECAA is something I could take ? 

5. For sleep I know magnesium is important will try to inculcate bananas in my diet.
