1r5zks7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r5zks7/relationship_turned_into_situationship/,Relationship turned into situationship,"Me (21F) and my now ex boyfriend (22M) broke up Friday due to him saying we are incompatible marriage wise.

We met each other in October, and he was fresh out of a living together relationship. He had moved to this state and moved in with his ex (who he obviously no longer speaks to), and I moved here to go to school. Essentially- we are each others entire social life. I do believe I started off as a rebound, but he genuinely grew to love me and off the bat said he was looking a long term relationship/life partner. He said he “didn’t want to be 25 and single”, his goal is marriage. In the beginning, as all relationships are, it was great. We did have some issues (I am very emotional and he internalizes his) but we did fall in love despite different communication/emotional styles. However, we surely had rocky times in our short relationship where he thought I was going to break up with him several times despite me not bringing it up. We talked about marriage, about kids, about what state we wanted to live in long term.

This is unrelated but I do have BPD, and I tend to self sabotage with arguments and such. I can be pretty verbally explosive especially when drunk, and he is not so much that way, but he was always forgiving and didn’t hold grudges.

Our relationship escalated pretty fast, from the moment I met him, we spent no more than 1-3 days/nights apart which quickly turned into me spending 7 nights a week there. A couple weeks ago, our state got hit with a snow storm that closed businesses, schools, everything down (state wide emergency). However, he hadn’t gotten a call from his boss that he was off work, and was expecting me to leave when he left the following morning. I didn’t feel comfortable to drive as it was strongly advised against. He told me he would let me stay, but he felt really uncomfortable with the idea of me being there while he wasn’t. He expressed pretty early on in the relationship that the next girl he lived with/had a key to his place, he would be sure would be the one he’d get married to. It didn’t make sense to me that I spend 7 nights a week there but he didn’t trust me to be there. I had said I felt like we had different views of the relationship and maybe we shouldn’t have started dating. He kind of shut down after that and didn’t really have much to add to the conversation. I slept out on the couch for the first time that night, and the next morning he had thought that was me breaking up with him but I explained it was rather my fear of being more emotionally invested than him.

We took a break from seeing each other for a day after that and he invited me over the next. I was hurt, and my energy was closed off from him. He felt it, and we had a conversation that resulted in us going on a break because he didn’t want to make any definitive choices about breaking up right then and there although he said “going no contact” was unnecessary. The break lasted 9 days, and we still texted. When we saw each other again last weekend, we didn’t talk about “it”. We acted like everything was normal but I could tell there was something still underlying obviously.

On Friday, I asked him if he loved me and wanted to be with me. He said he did love me, and in response to my second question, asked if I really did want to have that conversation right then and there. I obviously said yes, and he said explained that he no longer feels us to be compatible for marriage because we are two different of people, and he dates to marry. I was devastated. He was surprised it wasn’t a mutual sentiment. I cried and cried, and said I would do anything to save our relationship. I was sorry for putting such strain on it. I said I know he probably won’t, but I really hope he changes his mind. He comforted me, and told me he might be making a mistake but it was unfair of him to not tell me where his head was at. I asked him if he wanted me to leave and he didn’t. We both slept together and actually slept together in his bed that night. We woke up and he embraced me for 2 hours, kissing my head and holding me close. I packed my things up from around his house after that, He told me that this didn’t mean he wanted nothing to do with me, or he wanted to stop hanging out with me, or that he didn’t love me, and finding someone else isn’t even remotely where his head is at. and he invited me over for dinner and to exchange our Valentine’s Day gifts later that night. I went. While we didn’t end up opening our gifts, he made us dinner. He initiated every embrace, every kiss, sex, me spending the night, and again this morning we cuddled for an hour with no words, just affection. It almost felt like he was more embracing of me after we had this talk. He made me coffee and breakfast and we watched our show and cuddled for hours. I finally decided to open our gifts and leave at 4 pm, to which he was surprised I was leaving.

I guess I just want to know if I am ignorant for staying in this gray area hoping he’ll change his mind if he sees we can have a relationship with no unnecessary volatility , and why he’s acting like this when he broke up with me. Is this a situationship now? Could we ever come back from this?",1,1771215138.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1r5zkc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5zkc2,Help! Heating issue with  [Faema Emblema],"Help!



I picked up a Faema Emblema 2-group and I'm stuck on a heating issue. The board displays the crossed-out heating element icon and never clicks the relay to fire the heater. No error codes on the display -- just the crossed-out coil symbol.                                        



  What I've verified so far:



  \- Heating element: All 3 legs read \~39 ohms each at the board connector. 6 terminals, continuity confirmed through each loop. Element is good.

  \- Safety thermostat (TERMOSTATO DI SICUREZZA): Closed, has continuity. Attempted manual reset (button presses in but no click). Continuity breaks when I disconnect a spade terminal from the thermal switch, confirming it's in-circuit.

  \- Full circuit continuity from the board connector through the safety thermostat through the heating element and back -- confirmed on all 3 legs (red, black, brown).

  \- FEEDING parameter: Entered Standard Data with DIP 1 ON, confirmed FEEDING is set to ""electric.""

  \- Full memory reset: Pulled the battery from the CPU board, re-entered all Standard Data from scratch. Heating element still crossed out.

  \- No error codes: No E4, E51, E52, E58, or any other code. Just the crossed-out icon.

  \- Water level probe: Checked.

  \- NTC temperature probe: Checked.

  \- Pressure sensor: Was giving false readings earlier (1.9 bar with boiler at only 130F). Fiddled with the pressure transducer wires and got normal readings (0.3-0.6 bar). No E58 since then, but heating stopped working around the same

  time.

  \- OK button: Pressing and holding OK does nothing. The icon does not alternate with OK -- it's just the static crossed-out symbol.

  \- Everything else works: Display, pump, boiler fills, steam was working when the boiler was hot earlier (before this issue started).



  Timeline: The boiler was heating fine at one point during my initial troubleshooting. I was dealing with E58 overpressure alarms caused by the faulty pressure sensor readings. After I fiddled with the pressure transducer wires to get

  a normal reading, the E58 went away but the heater stopped firing and hasn't come back since.



  Anyone seen this before on the Emblema platform? Is there a sensor input that silently blocks heating without throwing an error code? Wondering if it's the water level probe detection circuit or if the board/MCU is dead.



  Thanks for any ideas.

1r5ziqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r5ziqm/ive_accidentally_cursed_a_man_with_my_art/,I’ve Accidentally Cursed a Man With My Art,"It was always the eyes that got me. Every other part of the human anatomy I mastered. Hands have become routine, where my colleagues struggled. Complex movements and poses I can replicate without a model present. No matter how hard I try, though, I couldn't get the eyes right. The physical aspect of eyes I could draw with ease, but the problem was that when you looked at the eyes I made, they just looked flat. They never stared back at you as they should. They stare like the fake eyes on a paper they were, they've never really seen anything, no story to tell. The inability to draw true eyes was my biggest frustration.

So, when I received the call from a publisher asking me to draw a cover for an upcoming horror novel, my interest was piqued. I had drawn several fantasy covers before, but had never done horror. I took a call with the author that day so he could explain the book's premise and what he wanted. I honestly wasn't very interested in the plot, as it sounded like a typical Lovecraft type story that never actually explains what the monster looks like. Maybe he was just bad at explaining it, and it's better in context. Either way, what really stood out to me was his idea for the cover art. 

""I want you to draw the character looking straight at the reader with a terrified expression on his face. You can't see what he's looking at, but you can see the terror in his eyes.""

As soon as he mentioned the eyes being the focus, I accepted the job on the spot. I was given two months to work on the cover, a perfect sink-or-swim deadline for me. Either this would be the final push I needed to master eyes, or I would fail completely. I got to work right away and finished the image's background in a few days. The rest of the body was easy to draw, since the author described the character as extremely basic, so the audience could ""put themselves in the character's shoes,"" as he put it.

While the rest of the picture was coming out well, I once again was struggling with the eyes. Every pair of eyes I drew on was fine, but just fine, and I wasn't taking fine anymore; it needed to be perfect. Weeks went by with no progress, several different eyes drawn and deleted, several references thrown out, and I was left with an eyeless face staring back at me from my computer. I actually began to panic, unsure of what I was doing wrong. In flipping back through my old references, I had discovered the problem. None of these eyes had seen real horror. You can't fake that horror that coats the backs of the eyes; it lingers there and doesn't leave. That was my problem: I was looking for truth in something that was a fabrication, something you can't fake. I needed eyes that had seen true terror, and I needed them quickly. 

I began my search for eyes that had seen terror on the internet. That road took me to see some terrible, shock sights just full of gore and other heinous things that I regret looking at now. I quickly learned that the eyes of the dead don't leave much behind. I needed to find someone alive who had seen true horror, and I needed to see them in person. I began looking for support groups in the local area, I know it might not have been the most tactful approach but putting out a call for models who had gone through extreme trauma wouldn't have been much better, besides anyone who would have responded to an ad like that would probably be in a place in life where they've processed what they've seen and learned to live with it. I needed someone who relived what they saw daily, where the terror is still fresh in them. Lucky for me, there was an ongoing support group for survivors. I wasn't sure what they had survived, but I decided to take a chance and go.

I would like to say I was nervous about going there and potentially exploiting someone else's tragedy for my art, but I would be lying. Walking up to the community center where the group met, I genuinely felt excited. I was even there early to help set up. I met with the organizer, an intentionally soft-spoken woman named Joe, who assured me I wouldn't have to share today if I didn't want to. As more people filed in, I did my best to go unnoticed; unfortunately, everyone was so friendly that they went out of their way to welcome me when they arrived. All except one. A man in an oversized coat that could wrap completely around himself walked in and, upon seeing me, gave a simple smile and nod without making eye contact. The group took their places around the circle of chairs we had made, and Joe began the meeting.

""It's good to see you all again. I hope you're all doing well,"" Joe said in a soft motherly voice. ""As you can see, we do have a new person joining us today. Would you like to introduce yourself?"" 

I panicked at this moment and blurted out the first fake name I could think of. ""Tobias!"" I said a bit too loudly. I still don't know why I did what I did next, but without anyone asking me to, I rose to my feet and started explaining the tragic backstory I had made up. I had compiled a few true crime documentaries and horror movies into one long, tragic story, just in case anyone asked why I was there. No one did, so I have no idea why I felt the need to spell it all out right there. Nevertheless, everyone was nice enough to clap at my story, and I sat back down, determined not to talk the rest of the night. 

""Thank you for sharing your story with us, Tobias. I think we can all understand how daunting it can be to share your story with strangers."" Joe said.

A larger man stood up. ""Well, even though everyone else here knows my story, I don't mind telling it again for our new friend."" The others in the group nodded in agreement, and Joe looked touched by the gesture. The next hour I spent listening to the group's backstories, one at a time, and to how they've been struggling to overcome their pasts. As bad as it is, I barely remember any of their stories, but I looked attentive as I took this time to stare each person in the eyes to see if they had what I was looking for. Unfortunately, none of them did; they all had intense pain, sadness, and rage in their eyes, but none of the true fear I was looking for. I was about to give up when the man in the oversized coat was the last person left to speak. 

""Phillip?"" Joe asked, already knowing the answer but hoping to be surprised, to which the man looked at her for only a brief moment before shaking his head and looking back down. Joe nodded and continued as if nothing happened. The meeting ended not long after that, with Joe noting she's proud of everyone today. As everyone was helping to put the chairs back, I walked up to Joe to ask why Philip was so quiet.

""Some people take time to open up to others."" She answered, trying to hide how rude she thought the question was. ""The rest of the group made great strides today in opening up to a stranger. I think we should focus on that today."" 

""I wouldn't be too offended."" The large man said after Joe walked away. ""Philips has been coming to these for months, and nobody knows his story. I don't even think Joe knows for sure."" I nodded and made my way outside, even more intrigued by this mystery man in the big coat. Lucky for me, as soon as I walked out of the building, I saw the man in question smoking under a street lamp with the beam shining down on him like a sign I needed to speak to this character.

""Can I bum one of those?"" I said, causing Philip to jump. 

""Sure,"" he responded, so quietly I could barely hear him

Philip pulled the pack and the lighter out of one of the many pockets on his coat and handed them to me. I took one out and lit it. I don't actually smoke, so I awkwardly held the lit cigarette in my hand for the rest of the conversation. Unfortunately, I couldn't think of anything else to say.

""I'm… I'm sorry I didn't say anything."" Philip said 

""Hey, man, it's cool. Some people take time to open up,"" I said, trying as subtly as possible to get a look at his eyes. He didn't seem to notice.

The silence between us fell again. ""I think it's gonna snow soon,"" I said randomly, hoping to get Philip to look up. To my surprise, he did, and in the few seconds between him looking to the sky and looking back down, I got a look at one eye. Even in that one eye, I could see all I needed to. An eye that had not only seen true horror but lived with it every day. I had finally found it, but I needed to see them both, see enough that I could at least get a rough sketch of what I needed. 

""Yeah, I guess it is,"" Philip said, looking back down at the pavement. He then put his cigarette out and was about to leave. I had to get him to stay.

""Hey, I know you don't like to talk about your past in front of everyone. I know it can be daunting, but why don't you just tell me for now? Maybe it will help."" 

Philip shrugged. ""I don't know."" 

I persisted. ""No, it's ok, I know this dinner around the corner, we could go there and talk. It will get you used to speaking in front of someone else. Just think of how excited Joe and the others would be if next session you're talking up a storm."" 

Philip seemed to consider this for a moment, and I took that as my opportunity to guide him by the shoulder in the direction of the diner. Philip was surprised but went along with me with no protest. 

We sat down across from each other in a booth, a coffee in front of each of us. I had placed a pocket notebook in front of me and began drawing Philip. He was confused by my actions, so I did my best to calm him down. 

""I like to draw just as a hobby, I find it helps me destress at times. I hope you don't mind,"" Philip nodded, believing my lie. ""So tell me about yourself,"" I asked.

He hesitated for a moment. ""I work the night shift at a grocery store… I play video games sometimes. I don't know what to say, to be honest."" 

""Any family?""

Philip fell quiet. ""No… no, they're gone.""

""I'm so sorry. You don't have to,"" I said, now feeling a pang of guilt, but I still needed more time to finish my sketch.  

""No, it's ok,"" He took a deep breath. ""My brother…he always had problems. We always hoped he would turn things around. He didn't. I was sleeping when it happened. He and my parents were yelling, fighting about something. I tried to go back to sleep…I couldn't."" I could see his hands shaking for a moment. I thought about telling him he could stop, but I said nothing. ""I heard my mother scream before her voice was cut short. I ran to the hall to grab the phone. I called the police. My brother was coming up the stairs, his hands covered in blood, holding a knife. I ran back into my room and tried to hide in my closet. My brother came in soon after and was tearing apart my room when I heard the police announcing their entrance. My brother saw me… he rushed towards me. The next all happened in an instant. The police yelled for my brother to drop the knife. He grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the closet. A shot was fired, and my brother fell dead to the floor. I can still remember the empty look in his eyes while he lay there covering the carpet in blood. I don't remember much after that, just a lot of people talking to me and asking me questions. I didn't hear until I was eventually sent to stay with my grandparents. 

A long silence hung between us. Phillip seemed surprised that he had talked this much. I wasn't sure what to say. This had gotten a lot more real than I was prepared for, and my initial feeling was that I needed to get away from this conversation. I thanked him for sharing his story and tried to offer some basic, encouraging words that meant nothing but sounded nice, before making up an excuse to leave. Phillip told me he understood, but I could tell he was worried he said something wrong. I wanted to assume it was ok, he was ok… but I didn't, I couldn't, I just gave some meaningless pleasantries and for some reason decided to give him my phone number before rushing home. 

As soon as I got home, I began drawing eyes using the sketches I made of Philip as a reference. I worked all night drawing eye after eye, and by the time the sun came up, I had finally done it. I finished my painting for the cover and looked at it with reverence. It was perfect, true horror in the eyes of the subject. It didn't matter what monster the person in the painting was looking at; you could tell just by the eyes that it was a horror beyond comprehension. I submitted the cover to the publisher. Barely a day later, I got a call telling me that the author loved it and that it was exactly what he wanted. 

When the book came out, the reviews were average, but everyone noted how much the cover art drew them in and stuck with them days after they finished reading. After that, I received daily requests for more work on horror-related projects. I started drawing scenes of people facing off against horrifying walking corpses, monsters beyond comprehension, vicious, unnatural animals, people being ripped apart, and people in every state of anxiety and terror. The one thing all of these images had in common was the eyes, the true eyes of fear that I had taken from life. Whether people knew it or not, the eyes were the only truly terrifying part of the image. I could have drawn a cover with just the eyes, and it would have had the same effect as any of the other fully drawn pictures. 

My career was at its peak. Then one day, while working on the cover art for some independent video game, I received a call. When I saw it was Phillip calling, I wasn't sure whether to answer. It had been months since that first conversation, and I didn't want to get pulled into his life more than I needed to. Despite telling myself not to, I answered the call. 

""Hey… sorry I haven't called in a while,"" Phillips voice sounded more shaky and nervous than what I remembered. 

""No problem, man. Life happens, I get that… how are you?"" 

""I'm…Actually not great… Do you think we could meet at the dinner again?"" He was trying to keep his breath stable but was failing. ""I'm sorry, I just wasn't sure who else to talk to.""

I hesitated; I wanted to say that I was busy and we could reschedule. I didn't, maybe I thought I owed Philip that for what he unknowingly contributed to my work, maybe it was just guilt. Either way, I told him yes.

When I arrived at the dinner, Philip looked like he had been waiting there for over an hour, a steady rotation of coffee refills from a disinterested waitress keeping him company. I sat down across from him, trying to hide my apprehension about what my subject might say. 

""I've been seeing things, man,"" Philip said with a firm tone I've never heard from him before. Like all the uncertainty I saw in him before was gone, and all that was left was the desperation of a man who needed to be heard. ""It started a few weeks ago. I thought I was having bad dreams. I have bad dreams all the time, but these weren't my normal dreams. The first was some strange monster I couldn't even make out what it was chasing me down, and in an endless hall, the next night was about a squid-like monster pulling me underwater. I kept having dreams about these horrifying monsters and things attacking every time I slept. I thought it was only when I slept, but then I started seeing them when I was awake. Something out of the corner of my eye, a shadow moving behind a door. I started keeping track of every dream I had and everything I saw,"" He handed a notebook to me. ""I don't know what to do, man, I can't sleep, I can't stay awake, those things are always chasing me.""

I felt a pit in my stomach. I knew those scenes; I made those scenes. That couldn't be true; my work couldn't have affected him. Philip never even saw my work. He didn't even know who I was. But if it was, if Phillip was seeing monsters I created, the notebook he had would confirm it. With shaking hands, I opened the book, and there it was, a disruption of every picture I had drawn in the past few months, with Philip as the victim in every scene. He had been chased by rotten flesh-covered zombies, torn apart by giant creatures, haunted by shadows of the dead, burned by demons, and stalked by unknowable beings from beyond our reality. All my creations, all my fault. At the time, I needed this not to be real, that Philip was just crazy, and he had just seen my covers somewhere, and his mind made them real.

""I'm sure you're just stressed, you've been through a lot, and you're seeing things they aren't real."" I tried mask my fear behind an air of authority. 

""Real or not, I can't sleep, I can't live while all this is around me. My chest hurts from my heart pounding every minute of every day."" 

""Maybe you could go to Joe for help. I'm sure she's qualified."" Philip looked at me with those eyes I coveted, now full of disappointment, like I was his last hope. ""She said that I should check myself in somewhere… I don't know if I could do that, or if they could help. At least out here I could still run away, maybe I could outrun all this."" He looked down at his cold coffee. 

""If it's in your mind, you can't outrun that."" 

""Maybe, but I can try… ""Philip looked over my shoulder and got up quickly, dropping a few bills on the table. He spoke, not taking his eyes off whatever was behind me. ""Thanks for coming out here, but I… I have to go."" 

I tried to ask him what was wrong, but he wouldn't look at me. I turned around, and as I suspected, there was nothing there. By the time I turned back, Philip was gone.

That night, I sat in front of my tablet, hesitating to work. There was no way that my finishing this cover would subject Philip to another horror, but I couldn't get the thought out of my head. I told myself that he was just crazy and I had to get back to work like nothing had happened. I decided that I would not think about the owner of the eyes more than I had to. I finished the work that night and submitted it to the client; of course, they loved it. The next few days, I couldn't get up the gumption to work on anything. I hadn't responded to any further inquiries about more work and just tried to drown out my own thoughts about Philip. Days went by, and the flood of requests started to die down a bit.

I decided I needed to get my head straight. I needed to talk to Philip again, maybe get him the help he needed, anything to get my head back on straight. I called Philip, but after several rings, I was left on voicemail. I tried calling multiple times after, and every time I got voicemail. I tried calling Joe to see if she knew where Philip was, but that was another dead end as she said he hadn't seen him either. I was at a loss. I couldn't find him. I didn't even know what his full name was, so I couldn't check to see if he was in the hospital. If he had left town and left his phone behind, I would have no way to find him, and if he was dead… I would have to read it in the obituary. 

The guilt was hitting me, whether in some horrifying way my work warped this man's mind or not, I still felt responsible for what happened. I still used this poor man for my own gain and didn't even give him the courtesy of learning his full name. I had used his eyes and made him see the darkest horrors imaginable. I decided I needed to do something; if I couldn't find him, I would do what I could. That day, I refused any request for horror-related work. I pivoted to children's fantasy and romance books using Philip's eyes in that art. I thought that maybe, wherever he was, these wholesome positive images would cancel out the horror I subjected that man to. 

As expected, my career took a turn after this, with most criticisms of my work coming from people who said the scenes are composed well, but that the characters in the picture are off-putting. I knew it was the eyes, eyes that had seen horror, eyes I hope to show something else. I don't care if people like my new work, I don't care if work dries up, I will spend every day drawing these scenes of love, of wholesome adventure, of kindness, with the eyes I have used for my own means. 

I don't know if he'll ever find this. I don't know if Philip is even still alive. But if he's out there, if he reads this, I want to say, I'm sorry.

1r5zhvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1r5zhvn/why_am_i_getting_ghosted/,Why am I getting ghosted?,"I 25\[M\] am getting ghosted constantly. 

As a background, I think I am fairly attractive. Over 6 ft tall, athletic build. Several women have said I am attractive (around a 7-8/10). I also think I have pretty good people skills. I can make conversation with just about anyone.

To explain the situation, here are some examples of what has happened over the past few days.

Tinder match asked if I was free and we made plans. My dog got hurt and I asked to postpone since I wasn’t in the best head space. She left me on read after that. I asked if everything was ok and was left on read again.

Made coffee plans with another match. We were supposed to get coffee in the morning and right before I left to meet her(about 45 minutes before the time as I live farther away than her) she said she didn’t feel good and asked to postpone. I said that was fine and tried to make conversation like we were before the plans. She never responded.

I made eye contact with a girl at the bar. She seemed interested so I said hi. She gave very positive signs and her number. We met at another bar later and had a conversation that was going well. The friend she was with(a guy who seemed interested but she did not seem to like him back) asked her to grab drinks and she said she would be back. They never came back. I assumed the guy might have pulled her away, so I text her in the morning asking if we can set a date, but no response. I know the number worked because I texted her about meeting at the other bar and she responded.

This I the type of thing that keeps happening. I meet/match with someone. Things seem to be going very well. Make plans or attempt to make plans. They either cancel then ghost me or just ghost me.

I try to only look for women that I would have a genuine interest in aside from just looks and if a girl doesn’t show interest I just move on, but the fact that I keep having this problem is hurting my confidence. I wonder if I said something wrong, if she got cold feet or if I was supposed to text something else.

Any thoughts would help. Just venting here helps a little.",1,1771214891.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

The closest thing I’ve found since is **Little Wolf – La Pradera Washed Chiroso (**[link](https://littlewolf.coffee/collections/coffee/products/la-pradera-chiroso)**)**, but finding similar coffees has been surprisingly inconsistent. I’ve tried searching by origin, varietal, process, tasting notes, even sticking to the same roaster — sometimes it works, often it doesn’t.

Has anyone here tried either of these coffees? If so, how would you describe their flavor profiles?

For those of you who are also chasing very specific flavor profiles, how do you *reliably* look for coffees that match your taste? Especially when ordering online usually means committing to a full bag, so I’d love to hear what’s worked for others.

For reference, my typical brew recipe:

* Hario V60
* 16 g coffee
* Kingrinder K6 — 104 clicks
* 48 g bloom for 30 s
* Single pour to 250 g total",0,1771214891.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

So for context, Ive only ever been in one “official” relationship with a man when I was like 19 (for two months). I’m 23 now and am still trying to figure myself out. I’ve always had an inkling I like girls too, and now I’ve been thinking more so than guys, that’s a whole nother thing, but I haven’t had much experience with women myself in this way.

There’s a barista at the coffee place I go to and she had commented on how she loved the way the color in my hair was fading and that it “looks better every time” that I came through. I was flattered of course but brushed it off (I go there a lot), didn’t let myself think too much of it

Then the next time I went it was a different girl in the drive thru and when my drink was ready the girl from before passed the girl working the drive thru to give me the drink herself, and even after I had my drink and could’ve just been a “have a nice day” and I drive away moment, she again, complimented my hair, said she wanted to copy my order since it smelled good. Then I had mentioned I just liked the try new things she then went on to tell me new spring drinks were coming, if I liked blue redbull because they’d be getting that and yada yada.

I had a thought in my head like “this girl is super friendly, is this like flirty?” But I’ve been known to misread so I brushed it off until I asked one of my friends who had also been with a girl before and she saw it as a little flirty. But then my straight friend was seeing it as a no, and just being a good customer service person.

I’m probably overthinking this and she’s just nice, but it’s like both times I’ve seen her in a row she’s talked to me. And of course she must’ve seen me before since she commented on my hair fading everytime I come through. She’s complimented my hair, my nails, my order. Then the whole giving me the drink herself and talking to me threw me off. So I don’t know. I wanted more opinions from people who are actually experienced in how women flirt , because I know my version of flirting would just be me being nice and hope the other person is psychic 😂. Any opinions on this though? Or how I should go moving forward? I don’t even know if she likes girls

Two weeks ago, he let me keep my finished loyalty card (buy ten drinks get the next one free) and just gave me a free drink. He told me to use the loyalty card when he wasn’t working. Today he gave me a crazy discount (a $3 large latte with oat milk, should’ve been at least like $6) and he filled out four spots on my loyalty card when he only should’ve marked one.

Is it for customer loyalty? Does he hate his job so he doesn’t mind giving out discounts? We’ve chatted once or twice but I’m really awkward so I’m definitely not one of his more chatty regulars. I go one weekends, either just Saturday or sometimes Sunday as well. I just get my coffee and sit there for a few hours until closing, either gaming or studying.

I feel bad, I don’t want him to think I want to use him for discounts or to get him in trouble! Does he just not care about his job or something? It’s not every time but it’s definitely a lot.

1r5z0x8,https://youtube.com/shorts/f3FperbGUfU,My Claude trading bot evolved! I added/built a simple trading tool within my bookkeeping and budgeting app!,"Eight months ago I put $400 into Robinhood and told ChatGPT to trade for me.

The first trade doubled.

Then on the second day ChatGPT told me, “Uh… I can’t actually see live stock prices.”

Classic.

So instead of quitting, I did what any calm and normal person would do.

I spent eight months asking AI way too many questions until I accidentally built my own trading platform.

First, I built a giant Python script.

About 50 files.

It would:

	•	Pull all S&P 500 stocks

	•	Grab options data

	•	Build credit spreads

	•	Score them  

  

	•	Collect news

	•	Run the data through GPT

It took 15 minutes to run. It worked about 85% of the time.

People thought it was cool. But it felt like duct tape.

So I tore it down and rebuilt everything as a real web app.

Now here’s what it does — explained simply.

When I open one tab, it scans all 475 stocks in the S&P 500.

It checks important numbers like:

	•	IV (implied volatility — how wild traders think the stock might move)

	•	HV (historical volatility — how much it actually moved)

	•	IV Rank (is volatility high or low compared to the past year?)

	•	Earnings dates (big risk events)

	•	Liquidity (can you actually trade it easily?)

Then it runs “hard gates.”  Think of gates like filters. If a stock fails the filter, it’s out.

Examples:

	•	If the options are hard to trade → gone.

	•	If volatility isn’t high enough → gone.

	•	If earnings are too close → risky.

	•	If borrow rates are crazy → risky.

Out of 475 stocks, usually about 120 survive.  That means the filter actually filters.

Then it scores the survivors from 0–100.

Based on:

	•	Volatility edge

	•	Liquidity

	•	Earnings timing

	•	Sector balance

	•	Risk factors

It even penalizes if too many top picks are from the same sector.  No piling into just tech.

Now here’s where AI comes in.

I send the 120 passing stocks to Claude and GPT APIs (seeing which performs better).

But not to predict the future.  AI is not allowed to guess.

It only reads the numbers and explains patterns.

It writes things like:

	•	“89 stocks show declining historical volatility.”

	•	“Technology has 6 of the top 20, creating concentration risk.”

	•	“This stock has an 89-point IV-HV spread, possibly a data issue.”

Every sentence has numbers.  The math explained in simple English.

Then it picks the top 8 stocks automatically.

For each one, the app:

	•	Pulls live prices

	•	Pulls the full options chain

	•	Chooses a good expiration (30–45 days out)

	•	Calculates Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)

	•	Builds strategies like:

	•	Iron Condors

	•	Credit Spreads

	•	Straddles

	•	Strangles

Each strategy card shows:

	•	Max profit

	•	Max loss

	•	Probability of profit

	•	Breakeven prices

	•	A full P&L chart

	•	Warnings if spreads are wide

Then Claude explains the trade in plain English.

Example:

“You collect $1.15 today and risk $3.85 if the stock drops below $190. Theta earns about $1.14 per day from time decay. Probability of profit is 72%, meaning about 7 out of 10 times this expires worthless.”

Again — numbers only.

AI reads the math and translates it.  It does not decide.  I decide.

It also pulls:

	•	Recent news headlines

	•	Analyst ratings (Buy / Hold / Sell counts)

  

All automatically.  So in about 30 seconds:

475 stocks

→ 120 pass filters

→ Market risk summary

→ Top 8 analyzed

→ Strategies built

→ Greeks calculated

→ P&L charts drawn

→ News attached

→ Plain-English explanation

Zero clicks.  Cost: about 33 cents in AI usage per scan.

The edge isn’t fancy math.  Black-Scholes is standard math.  Greeks are standard.  Anyone can calculate them.

The edge is speed and structure.

Before I finish my coffee, I know:

	•	What volatility looks like across the entire S&P 500

	•	Which sectors are crowded

	•	Which stocks have earnings risk

	•	What the top setups look like

	•	What the numbers actually mean

Most retail platforms don’t do all of that automatically.

The tech stack (simple version):

	•	Website built with Next.js + TypeScript

	•	Live data from Tastytrade

	•	AI analysis from Claude and ChatGPT (in parallel) 

	•	News from Finnhub

	•	Hosted on Vercel

No Python anymore.  Everything runs in the browser.

This is not financial advice.  AI doesn’t control money.

It scans.  It filters.  It explains.

Humans decide.

That’s the whole lesson.

AI is powerful.

But only when it assists — not when it replaces thinking.",1,1771213484.0,buildinpublic,0,1.0,False

Is it bait for something?","I work as a sales associate at a retail ski and snowboard shop and the other day some random guy, probably in his mid 50's guy came in with his son. The interaction started out as normal, mainly talking about what equipment he should get for his son. However, at the end of the interaction he suggested we exchange contacts and meet up for coffee sometime. He didn't say what for in particular but he gave the impression that it was for something business/opportunity related. Me, being naive and broke, accepted the offer to meet up.

Two days later we met up for coffee after my shift. I had no idea what to expect but we ended up talking about all kinds of things. He essentially never disclosed what type of business he is in but offered to be my mentor. He went on and on about general philosophies, what he values in people, how people become successful, etc. We ended up chatting for about an hour and I believe he said the word e-commerce once, so I assume thats what this is all about?

The whole interaction left me very confused but his delivery was very convincing. He was very intense and made the offer seem as if I would be leaving a huge opportunity on the table if I told him I wasn't interested. He put a lot of pressure on me as if I was supposed to commit to something immediately. I can't help but feel like he is preying on me. Does anybody know what this is? Am I being manipulated?

I'm sometimes lonely, often times more lonely when I think – I suppose when I think, or more when I'm truly alone, that's when it hits most. Sometimes as I read from another post I relate in some way to it. I don't care? And so I believe it's when I think that I do care a bit too much to the point you start to criticise or truly feel what it is to be alone. I know its probably my fault and maybe I am to blame but I feel as if I'm smarter than others and I truly idolize those who aren't as smart as me and can be carefree, but unfortunately I can't do so. I think about everything and in common convo I think too hard and pass out common phrases that are once again, as I listed, common phrases that everyone says. Despite the fact I can text a few people I still feel alone – like nobody knows me. I am aware no one may care but even when I search up some sad shit out of boredom, I see posts just like the one I'm currently typing. Oftentimes I will relate to these posts and it'd almost motivate me to text them because I relate to an extent it's like a response like ""omg someone like me"" 😊

 

I feel as if loneliness is a state of mind, a sign of in depth thinking. Of course we would truly know what loneliness is if we did not care as well as not be as curious – of course I'm the curious type so I ask do you relate to all this so far and to the fact you sometimes don't care which I suggest is when your busy or occupied, and then you do care painfully potentially when your bored, thinking or outside – maybe for a coffee while alone? Too specific? Maybe so but I've texted a lot so far and I wonder whether my point and explanation as to the deeper, inner mindset I have is relatable in some way?

 

I've compared myself to those who I may not bring up but only because the stuff they did which I would relate to. I feel like to feel and act certain ways is a sign of intelligence and so is loneliness. Do you feel motivated to text those who feel alone just as I do? Do you want to meet and text people but are afraid because of judgement? I never use Reddit due to the users criticism but please tell me what you think.

Heartbroken.,"I just got dumped 2 nights ago after a tumultuous few weeks. We've been together almost 2yrs, I loved him so much he's my first love and I was his too. We traveled together, I started staying over all the time. He was kind, consistent, did what he said he was going to do. We had our own language, silly voices, promises, dreams. We got 3 cats together on top of his 1.

I was injured last year and got surgery in December, because that was coming up we planned his family coming down here to meet mine since I'd be recovering. He was so excited for a while, till one night I started talking about getting married like realistically I had listened to a podcast about being somebody's wife without the ring and them getting comfortable. I did his laundry, cleaned the apartment I spent most the week there too, cooked his meal prep, made him coffee every morning, just anything I could - it felt natural and he said he appreciated it.

He looked a bit scared, but said big things scare him - he does want to repeat his parents marriage, and neither did I, my parents had their problems too. Behind my back he canceled the parents coming, booked 2 weeks to go see his family and friends, and planned to break up with me. He couldn't go through with the breakup he loved me too much, we made up and he promised to come back next year do better, go to therapy. He sobbed his eyes out, promised me he loved me, he's been consistent and I expected him to do that.

I was so alone and sad during the holidays we kept talking, I couldn't walk, I was so excited for the Christmas together and he took that but I was like - this is one Christmas we will have more.

He came back in January and it was awkward, I was on crutches he was trying to get certain things done for his job and there'd been friction but we'd have good moments. I just got off crutches and he barely was about to start therapy he's only had 2 sessions. I had saw he wrote something in AI about changing my physical appearance when I was injured and on crutches, I crutched my ass in his apartment because I had missed him and he was doing that the night before I saw him. I didn't tell him what I saw but I confronted him about therapy, about being distant, and he said he knew we had to work on our relationship. He told me he was going to, he literally booked an appt the next day, he held me kissed me told me ""There was no maybe"". I chalked up his feelings to avoidant rumination, it was a dumb thought. He has shown me he's loved me so many times, we have such beautiful moments and memories. He admitted he needed to work on avoidant issues, as he's had them before and he always sabotages good things.

We took a week apart to kind of give him some space after all the arguing that happened, I just started walking like a week ago we haven't had a chance. He called me today and dumped me said the attraction isn't there? but he still loves me and if it wasn't for that we'd stay together.

What I've read is when avoidants are flooded they do this, attraction goes away, but peace and emotional connection can bring it back. I feel he just gave up on me.

I'm scared, I only pictured a world with him, he said I was a great partner and did everything right. I'm 26 going on 27, I'm horrified of not having kids and finding love. I still need to get my stuff, I feel so strange If I think about him I can be sad, but I also feel ya there were issues I want somebody who loves me and on bad days coming home to me makes them feel better.",1,1771212983.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It’s a really gorgeous dining room and back bar that I’ve been to a few times with the newborn at 8am for coffee. Food-wise we had:

Sausage & mushroom crostino - I could probably make this at home? It’s a $15 creamy and cheesy slice of bread that ive def made hammered before when i’ve come back from the bars and need sustenance. Still, really delicious

Frito misto - veggies only, no galimod, under seasoned for a greasy dish but good bar food to go with a few peronis 

Bucatini w/ beef sugo - really bright and acidic tomato sauce. Thought it could use more fat / richness to balance. Was the only dish I didn’t really mess with

Striped bass w/ salsa verde - have had this fish a bunch at restaurants and this one was done well. Thought it was pricy for $29 but nonetheless cooked well and the salsa verde was super bright and herby

Bavette steak - their version of a steak frites. Steak was cooked really well and had that open flame smoky taste which set it off. Sauce was a nice compliment to the fries and overall really loved this dish despite how simple it is 

Drinks wise crushed a few peronis along with their tomato water martini (good for folks who don’t want a super briney martini). Cheesecake was very good and the bar even poured us a little tawny port to go with it. 

Overall, left full and pretty happy. Didnt blow my mind and I’m kinda glad we just had a super comfortable dinner full of 7.5 - 8/10 dishes in the best way. Think this place would rock for a big group dinner

1r5yozi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5yozi,I Used Data Science to Find the Most Talked-About K-Dramas on r/kdramas,"Inspired by a recent “Top 100 K-Dramas” post, I got curious about which dramas are actually talked about the most on r/kdramas?

I’m currently working on my PhD, and a big part of my life is writing code and building data pipelines. So I decided to channel that into something fun and fandom-related. Instead of looking at ratings or personal rankings, I wanted to measure discussion volume, purely based on how often a drama is mentioned in posts and comments on this subreddit.

I scraped and processed text data from r/kdramas and built a small analysis pipeline to count total mentions for each drama. To make it as accurate as possible, I also incorporated commonly used acronyms ( the shorthand titles we all use in discussions). That way, mentions like “CLOY” or “2521” wouldn’t be missed. Everything was aggregated and cleaned to avoid obvious duplicates or mismatches.

A couple of important notes:

* This ranking is not based on ratings, reviews, or scores.
* It does not measure quality, only frequency of discussion.
* Since the data was extracted from text, image-only posts, GIF reactions, and visual references are not captured unless the drama name appears in text.

[Here is the link to the dashboard.](https://kdramas-dashboard-ik5sqpg5tmkmyx6f6bfv3v.streamlit.app/)

I am listing out top 50 here. If you are curious about a particular drama., you can comment and I can give you the rank

It hasn’t been an easy pregnancy — I’ve been in hospital on average a couple of times a week due to complications. The last time my mum was down visiting, I had to go to hospital unexpectedly and asked if she could come with me. She said no and made excuses. My partner and mother-in-law came straight away and have been supportive the entire time. I later found out my mum went out for coffee with my brother instead.

She’s also made some strange and hurtful comments about the baby. She’s said she doesn’t know if she’ll like him and that she prefers her cat over him. My sister actually told her off for saying those things. My mother in law responding to these comments by saying don't worry I already love him which I thought was very sweet. When I was about 5 months pregnant, I gave her one of my ultrasound photos. Her response was, “Why would I want this?” It really hurt — maybe not everyone would want one, but this is her first grandchild and I thought she’d appreciate it.

My partner doesn’t have a car and my mother-in-law doesn’t drive, so I asked my mum a couple of times over the past month if she’d be able to pick us up from hospital after the birth. She’s just ignored the messages. We’ve decided to get a taxi instead.

In a few days it’s also my birthday. She was meant to be staying down here, but a couple of days ago she told me she’s going to see a friend instead.
Then this morning, completely out of nowhere, she went on a rant in our family group chat saying she wants to delete me from it and throwing out insults. There wasn’t any argument beforehand. My partner and sister saw the messages and were confused too. I ended up blocking her on social media because I just don’t need the extra stress this close to giving birth, but now I’m second guessing myself.
My dad called later trying to “calm the argument down” but I explained there wasn’t even an argument from my side — it just came out of nowhere.
I don’t know if I’m being overly sensitive because I’m pregnant, but I feel really hurt by how cold she’s been. Has anyone else experienced something similar with their mum during pregnancy? How did you deal with it?",2,1771212411.0,PregnancyUK,2,1.0,False

Most of the girls I develop crushes on already have boyfriends. I understand that I should talk to girls without an agenda and be genuinely kind, curious, and respectful. I also know that many girls value traits like calmness, confidence, humor, authenticity, and someone who makes them feel comfortable and safe. I believe that building a solid friendship first is important.

That said, it’s hard to reconnect with high school friends because we no longer talk. Even when I reach out, the responses tend to be pretty dry. I also don’t really talk to people from college because my experience there was during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of them live far away from where I live. As for coworkers, all the girls I’m interested in are already taken, and I prefer to keep things professional.

Overall, I find it difficult to meet new people and form genuine friendships. I’ve been using Hinge for months, but I rarely get responses, even though I post good photos, write engaging prompts, and thoughtfully respond to others. Talking to people at the gym feels awkward because everyone is focused on working out. At coffee shops or restaurants, people usually just order, eat, and leave. At libraries, people are there to study. At church, people mainly come to pray. Even at concerts, while some people are friendly, others just want to enjoy the music and keep to themselves. I feel like it is hard approaching people in general and I really really do not want to come off as creepy. 

I’m genuinely trying to maximize my chances of meeting new people. I’m still working on reconnecting with old high school friends, and I’m also using dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid to put myself out there. In the meantime, I’m trying to work and improve myself. I’m sick of being single and being alone. I’m in my mid 20s and I feel like my time is running out. I want to date when I’m young and while I am at my prime. If people my age are dating, so should I. 

Please note I asked out 2 girls before and I got rejected. For the second girl, I hung out with her two times. The second time we hung out, I asked her out and she told me she had a boyfriend. She was single the first time we hung out, but I didn’t think it was the right time to ask her out. It’s been one year already and I keep thinking about her everyday. I want to move on and have feelings for someone else.

He was looking up a hooters though and that’s when we found out there are none, and there aren’t any kind of restaurants with that similar style actually, is it some kind of Oregon rule?? It kind of shocked me to be honest especially since we see that bikini stands are allowed.

Section 2.

The Stowaway

***(Twelve days ago.***

***Twelve?***

***Damn it, it’s supposed to be eleven.***

***Oh well… we’ll just have to catch up.)***

\~\~\~

 

Dellia, the great ring, should’ve hung in feathered clumps through Wade’s southern sky on a “fine” morning like this. Instead, the whole thing was smothered in blustery gray muck blowing sideways you could barely see through, maybe the last proper squall before Dellia’s shadow crept across the island kingdom.

Wade’s marina emptied out for the day, with everyone taking the storms as a personal, early invitation to the pubs for the Storms’ Passing festival.

Thing is, the festival was still two days away.

There were, of course, stubborn merchants pretending the market wouldn’t be affected. One bell in, though, and most of them headed in for shelter, warm cups, and local rumor tossing. At the far end of the wharf, where Tavern Street bent west toward the greater square, one refused to give in.

Esmeralda Rosalinda McGert.

She never missed a day.

The thought had crossed her mind to stay in. *Why risk being on the boat in this weather?* But she went out anyway.

And the catch was small.

The crowds? Nonexistent.

It was a bloody *rotten* day.

Neeson from the clothing stall across the way had been the only other one foolish enough to stay open for another bell, but the rain changed his mind too. 

“Don’t forget this!” Esmeralda waved a wrapped redfish at him. “Someone ought to enjoy it. It’ll ruin overnight, and I’ve got more than enough.” 

“Speakin’ of things sourin’...” Neeson skipped over the merging puddles and plopped three tins of paint down. “These’re goin’ bad. Grandson forgot ‘em on the upper shelf. They’re for the rubbish if you don’t want ‘em.”

Esme stole a glance at her stand. The whole thing was as tired as her captain’s coat. With a gleam in her eye, she reached over the counter and snatched Neeson by the shoulders, hauling him in for a quick kiss on the cheek. “I know *exactly* what to do!”

As Neeson, flushed, stumbled home, Esme flipped her sign to CLOSED and dumped her counter goods into an oversized basket. “You’ll be a fine feast!” she muttered, making her way to Beggar’s Corner. She found a father she’d seen there all week and pressed it into his hands. “Just make sure you lot finish these by tonight or they’ll spoil. Invite some of the others from the Corner over. There’s plenty to go round, and those blokes might be helpful in other ways. Just tell ’em this is from McGert and they’ll see to it you’re cared for.” She noticed how thin he and his wife were. The kids hovered back a few steps, watching. 

“Say, why don’t *you* and yours come by my place anytime tomorrow, alright? I’ll have more.” 

The father was having trouble keeping his emotions in check, but managed a nod. 

“Aw now, donna’ ya worry. Things will pick up for ya. I know it.” She gave a wink, and pushed him back towards his family. “Just remember to come by. Now go on and have a nice night.” She spun on her heel, yelling over her shoulder as she sprinted away, “Stay warm, ya hear!”

Back at the booth, the rain finally broke as she whipped up some fish balls for trade. After a small snack for herself, she made her way to see Ole Tom, who had a proper goods shop on the other side of the market. After negotiations for the fish balls (*and an added kiss on the cheek for Tom*), she had what she needed- brushes! Esme raced to the booth, and immediately set upon painting the inside with the tin of egg blue. Once the storm had passed completely, she tied a brush to a stick for the exterior, splattering globs of red and white paint on the ground which, like the mud, still hadn’t fully dried. 

It had an… eye-catching effect, with every other shingle a different color. Some would say it wasn’t even close to a good piece of art, but for Esmeralda it was a masterpiece. 

Despite the storm, the rest of the day left her with a grin she couldn’t shake. It was there from ear-to-ear as she dropped crab pots and shrimp traps before dinner. It was there when she contemplated going out, but decided bed was the smart choice. It was still plastered on her face when she woke like clockwork and whipped up a proper breakfast: buttered biscuit, spiced eggs, salt pork, and a damn fine coffee that could raise the dead. She gave a generous pour of cream in a mug the size of her head and pinched sea salt into the grounds to cut the bitterness.

Her father’s trick.

She was in such a damn fine mood, she crowned her biscuit with a spoonful of Mople berry preserve.

Rare as mercy.

Not because you couldn’t get the fruit in Wade. You could find anything here if you knew who to ask and what to pay. Mople just wasn’t something you got anymore. Not in Wade. Not anywhere. These days you only heard about it in rumors, or in the few stubborn jars that had survived longer than they had any right to.

And those, were guarded like sin.

She savored the last bit of breakfast when a chime went off in her moss-green canvas jacket. Her hand dove into a pocket, past a gutting knife and some twine until it landed on the pomander pocket-clock. She pulled it out and flipped open the case. The inside face was marked in thirteen neat divisions, each one notched with a tiny bell, with the hand now pulling deep past the second bell.

Esme clicked her tongue and snapped the device shut. “Late. Damn.”

She dropped the pomander back in the pocket. Her father had traded favors, pride, and a handful of rings he didn’t have to spare to get it made by a Kaiin tinker before he died- he hated being late.

And now she was late.

Late by her standards. Still ahead of most of Wade.

In a burst of energy, she donned her formal gear: a lanolin black and yellow gansey, with matching sou'wester, woolen stockings, overalls, belt, and fresh dubbin boots. She didn’t bother to tidy before heading out, pulling on the proper waxed, highly patched, and fish-blood bullied slicker with a flourish. A quick pat confirmed all was where it was supposed to be. Ditty Bag, Fid, sheepsfoot rig knife, marlspike, whet stone. She pulled nippers from an inner pocket of the jacket and slid them over her hands. Locking the door behind her, she strode out into the morning-night where the docks were loud with slap of wet planks, rope creak, and a gull that hadn’t fallen asleep, yelling at nothing.

Jimmy the drunk wasn’t whistling his way home.

Ty and Ren, the morning guards, walked by already on shift.

“Runnin’ behind, Esme?” quipped Ty.

“Aye, but breakfast was worth it!”

“Had to be to keep you this long,” mused Ren.

They shared a passing laugh. She spun on one heel. “Oh! Swing by mah booth and have a gander! Let me know what you think later!” Then hustled on.

Damn, she *was* late. But, today was going to be a *damn* fine day. *Twas in da bones*.

Esme’s boat sat low in the water with lines led true to the bollards. Forty-three feet of carvel-built coast-crawler, gaff-rigged with a single mast her father had stepped himself.

She felt the moorline give an impatient tug against the wooden pillars as the flood began to push into the marina. Most wouldn’t notice the change. “Double damns. Slack’s already broke. Gotta be quick about this.” The captain heaved herself up the snubbed line and over a timber-head, boots slamming the boards past the nets stacked tidy to port.

She felt twelve again even thinking she heard her father*.*

*“A damns pirate would be proud.”*

Then, straight to the tiller.

Her father had replaced it twice, and the second time he’d used Tíbar ironwood that cost him a month’s wages.

“*Worth every damn coin*.”

From here, thanks to her father, she could run the whole operation herself.

*“Let no lubber take from ye wast ye can do yashelf.”*

The man’s handiwork was everywhere. A rigged tie-off and a double-pulley on the main halyard so she could raise sail without leaving the helm. A modified centerboard that came up and down on a lever. Narrow storage bins built into the gunwales to keep her gear dry. Even the keel, reshaped and sheathed in copper to cut drag, and that big leaf-shaped rudder he’d hung on the stern for tighter turns when the harbor got crowded.

The best trick lived right in the deck. A plain iron handle by the tiller.

Esme hooked her fingers under it and yanked, triggering mooring slip-lines.

Chain snapped taut through its guides

The free ends slipped out of the bitts.

The bights dropped clean off the bollards.

The lines came hissing back through angled fairleads, stacking in wet coils on deck.

Up forward, the anchor clapped hard into its chocks.

Esme gave a nearby handle a quick wrist-flick and along the gunwale, the pot-runner woke up. Crab pots and shrimp traps skated aft on little rollers, bumping one by one into a stop-rail right beside the helm. All close enough she could work them with one hand while the other stayed married to the boat.

Those were just *some* of the tricks he built into this tugger.

Sunk every dime into it. Even then, doing it all himself, her father died owing half the island. But, he’d left her “…*ah boot any shooul on Wade wo’ld envah*.”

Esme was still grinning as she leaned a hip into the till and hauled the halyard as the bow swung free, despite the flood.

It was, by all accounts, a good Wade-morning for fishing. Just enough breeze to let her hide in the ripples. Moonless, Iria setting early. Mild overcast to cut what was left in the sky.

Halfway into her daily rotation, she had more load than she really needed.

Tomorrow’s odds and ends were mostly done, already waiting in neat coils and quiet knots. The barnacled crab pots were reset with fresh twine. The longlines were already stowed. F**ire-fishing was done; the lantern let low to a dim glow that she wasn’t going to bother to hood.** She’d made her deepwater dive at Bilber Hallow first thing after the pots and, invigorating as it was, she wished she’d skipped it. The chill sticks with you.

The main catch already had been sorted, which meant only the drift nets were earnin’ a living at the moment. Anything else was tempting the sea to get clever, and she was fine being greedy with the quiet.

Esme enjoyed the boredom and thinning clouds as they drifted by, washing the moment down with a sip of Dead Horse Reserve. She heard her father’s voice as she traced the sky.

*“Now, wat do ya sees? Back east.”*

“Broken Crown chasin’ the silver road of Iria.”

*“West?”*

“Dellia.”

*“Nerth?”*

“The island.”

*“An' in wintah?”*

“Perhaps light from Ten Towns on a very good night.”

*“Ye’ll be needin’ dis someday. C’mon now.”*

“Sundtí’s Velvet.”

*“O’erhead?”*

“Fisher’s Knot.”

*“South?”*

“The Drifters’ Union.”

*“Summah?”*

“Ghost Sun, with the frayed edge of the Great White Arch.”

*Here’s to you, Dad.*

Esme went to salute and noticed something off with the sky. An extra shimmer… moving. Coming in quick from the north. She fished a scope from her pocket and tried to catch it as it changed direction, now heading due east back towards Wade.

The ironwood tiller picked up a vibration which built to a painful buzz. She loosened her hand and let it hunt in the swell, trusting the boat for a breath while she glued her eye to the glass.

Bits of the familiar sky blinked out. Then returned. More blinks.

It was almost on top of her when she heard the familiar whisper of twin engines. Had it not been so still, she would have missed it.

“Well, hot damn. Ship 23. Looks like it’ll be a good time in the ol’ town tonight.”

The anomaly passed over, and the air dragged a sudden swirl across the water. Seconds later came a confused chop. Esme threw her weight back against the Tíbar ironwood to keep the bow from broaching.

“To hell with this!”

She snapped the scope shut and popped the pins on the drift-net winch. As soon as she could, she made way for port- partly hoping to catch a glimpse of Ship’s engineer, assuming Ship 23 landed in one piece. One never knows with that heap.

Esme was off-boat before the sky bothered with colors. Good she was back early, because offloading should’ve been easy. It wasn’t. Not because anything was broken.

Esme was... *distracted*.

She stretched time scraping the salt trays. Dragged the smoker into the lane instead of keeping it tucked out back. Sorted the fish. Twice. Anything she could do to have an excuse to stop every few minutes, make a little square with her fingers, and squint at her booth’s new paint job as if it might applaud her back.

Finally, she rolled out the surprise barrel from the day’s haul, a few sulking lobsters who’d been cheated out of a proper fight. She quickly plucked a rust-pike from the snapping mess. “Oh, you! *You* can get bent!” She marched it to the edge, and flung it back into the sea. “Go be crab food.”

On the way back she snatched up four large buckets of deepwater and brought them around front. “Oi, Neeson! What ya think of the new look!?!”

A voice from the empty-looking stall across the way answered back, “I knew if anyone could do something with that old paint, you could, darlin'!

Esme chuckled. She’d hoped coming back early would mean he wasn’t there. Nothing malicious- she was his friend and all, but somehow the mangy coot beat her here every morning and she hadn’t the faintest clue how.

“I’m gonna beat you one of these days!”

“I hope you do!”

It would have been better if he had said something a bit more competitive. This just meant, or so Esme thought, he didn’t think she ever would.

Her mind drifted. She kept half a thought on beating Neeson, half on the white ventveil fronds from the buckets. She lightly squeezed the brine water from the plants, fingers white with cold that didn’t seem to bother her. Plant only worked if you handled it proper. Get ‘em smoothed out, let ‘em warm slightly and it would sweat a jelly that stayed cold on its own. Had to keep them a touch damp, because if they turned blue, they were done.

An academic regular once told her it was called “*Laminaria Profundis Ventivela*.” Sounded fancy, but most people she knew just called them deepwater cloth. Ventveil, deepwater cloth, ghost wave... Whatever folks wanted to call it- it did the trick, staying cool through the afternoon if you kept the sun off.

Ice cost a fortune in Wade, but deepwater cloths? Free for the taking if you didn’t mind the cold and knew where to dive without extra equipment.

*And to think, I nearly skipped grabbing these.*

Bilber Hallow was a perfect spot for divable deepwater, and one you kept to yourself. Good for a quick morning dip, but it went too thin near four bells. Miss it early and you were stuck running clear past Widow’s Reach for a **deeper drop**. It was just a choice of when you wanted to be cold, how deep you wanted to go, and how soon you wanted to be back.

*Hells. I’d just be pullin’ in from Widow’s Reach.*

Then it all *clicked*.

“Oh! Oh, that’s clever!” she said with a laugh.

“Who is?” Neeson was never there when you looked.

“I am, of course!”

“Course you are, dear!”

*That’s how I’ll beat him! Bilber Hallow. It’s not a bad idea really, if you could catch it before it was full shallow*.

She smoothed the cloths into a base bed for the booth then put up her 'money-fish'. She staged the three best in a centerpiece: A good-sized Penny-fish Mutton and Grey-Bait-Stealer each flanking a Lead-Belly Landlord. She propped one up with a rolled strip of cloth, just enough tilt to make the scales throw back the morning that was just waking up.

*You could haul anchor early after the holiday tomorrow* *if you have another catch like today.*

To one side she coiled ribbonfish like silver belts, teeth smiling. Squid in a shallow wet-pan up front, smear of ink on the buyer's side. Salt can and fish balls opposite.

*It could work.*

Everyday fish made up the rest. Sea-Darts on the left. Silver Plates near the front. Knucklers in a bruised pile. Glass-Rain in a shallow tray, Lantern-Fuel beside it, and Scribbles- still twitchy- laid out on the right. She kept a couple of Borrowshark center-back.

*Cut through the hallow on the return, right at Don’t-Get-Greedy Knife before the water turned too thin to float a cork.*

Crabs went into a lidded basket with a stone on top, because crabs had ideas when you let them. The bait shrimp stayed tucked under cloth in the shade, still twitching.

*Double quick back. Fifteen minutes to dock.*

Fish balls at the front. Salt in a tin with a scoop. Smoked redfish strips hanging like flags. Dead center front was some strange creature she accidentally hauled in that looked like melting butter. An eye-catcher for any passerby.

*That’ll shave me*\- she counted on her fingers, “Ten minutes!”

“What’s that?”

“Oh nothing, Neeson! Just chattin’ up these here fish.”

She smiled even larger now, grabbing another handful of the deepwater cloth. She was sure it was a good plan, especially since no fool had been out that way for weeks… not since those damn Qalupalik had shown up. Those merfolk were an absolute nuisance. Clip one and a whole damn swarm would be upon you faster than you can sneeze. Then what? Yer spendin’ the next few days cocooned up somewhere, living out your worst humiliations on a loop.

“Some for you,” she muttered, stuffing a few small strips around random tails. “And some for my poor ole feet.” She dropped a few strips into her water bucket. “And hopefully some for that family.” She took the final few strips and wrapped some of the blue muttons and kingfish she had set aside.

She tidied a few last bits, and stepped back into the lane, almost to Neeson's booth, and took it all in.

The egg blue interior and the red-and-white checkerboard exterior made it look like an oversized children's toy. It was stuffed with every fish you'd want in a day.

That grin crept back across her face.

She'd done that.

And it was perfect.

She stomped back over and flipped a hand-scrawled sign that read: **OPEN**. 

“Alright, Neeson!” Esmeralda slapped both palms on her counter. “I know you’ve been lurkin’ over there pretendin’ you’re not starin’. Come on over and see the catch of the day! Fresher than a sea breeze at dawn. Got new sea salt ready too, just scraped it off the trays. And look here, Lamp-oil catch! Just like you love.” Esmeralda moved her upturned hands over the crown jewels of her booth. “Redfish smoked to perfection!

Across the lane, a head rose slow over a stack of folded linen like a suspicious turtle. He moved around front, laying out a choice of exotic fabrics and expertly woven clothes.

“You could sell sand to a beach, Esmeralda.”

“And you could sell shame to a saint, but we don’t bring that up in public. Now really. Tell me what you think of the paint job and the way this is all laid out. Look at that presentation. This here is craft. That’s discipline. That’s...”

“…That’s a crime,” Neeson pointed towards the Butter-blob in the front.

“Oh, don’t you start with me,” Esme laughed. “That’s an eye-catcher. People see that and go, ‘What in Dellia’s tears is that?’ and then they’re already halfway to handin’ me coin.”

Neeson finally pushed off his stall and shuffled over, coat flapping, boots complaining. He leaned in, sniffed it once squinting hard.

“Well, what in the hells is it?”

“No clue. Just caught in the nets.”

“I've lived by the sea my entire life and I'm still surprised by what you fisher folk could conjure up. Alright then, let's get a sample of smoked.”

“Sample?!? HA! If I didn’t love you, you old coot, I’d smack your knuckles with the marlspike for even thinkin’ that word.”

“Love’s a strong claim,” Neeson said, reaching anyway.

Esme swatted his hand, “You want a sample, you buy a strip. This ain’t charity lane.”

“That’s rich,” he muttered, glancing toward Beggar’s Corner. “Heard tale that the whole alley ate fine last night.”

Esme’s grin returned. “Well. It was just a Storms’ Passing gift. A little charity never hurts, ya know.”

“I reckon not. You got plans for feast tomorrow?”

“Dead Horse Inn!”

Neeson made that sour sound again. “I don’ know why anybody ever goes there. Terrible. Specially on a holiday.” 

“Well, I get one full day off a year and I plan to enjoy it. And speaking of time off, we both gotta get ready. So, what's your- I can’t believe I’m saying this, *sample* gonna be?”

“I knew you were a class act, Esme.”

“I got ribbonfish, squid that’ll still argue with you, knucklers, scribbles, these twitchy little bastards here, an’ a Borrowshark I swear tried to bite me through the net. I’m tellin’ you, Neeson… I got a feelin'. Today’s got bones.”

“I hope so. I need to get some cloth and I can't afford to go back to Armendale yet. So?”

“Whatever you like Neeson. Just don' get greedy.”

Neeson looked over the catch as Esme's eyes landed a glimpse of the uncloaked Ship 23 moored in air dock.

It was a marvelous wreck of a machine that should have been retired seven generations of McGerts ago. Patched and repaired more than her old coat, with twin balloons on adjustable rigging. A throwback to the Fleet’s original days when they were still figuring out which way was up.

Legends enough of the damn thing dropping parts, or people, from more than twenty roofs high. You might get lucky and it wouldn't smack your boat or gear, but be damned if something like that wouldn't ruin a few hours of work by spookin’ the fish. One of her too-many-greats-grandmothers called It *a “floatin' coffin with delusions”* in the family log books, and that was one of the more kind descriptions.

Despite looking as bad up close as it did from a distance, in today's dawn light the rust and imperfections melted, presenting the ship in all of its majestic glory. Perhaps this clouded reality came from a nostalgic childhood fancies for flying one of those beasties.

Or, perhaps, it was because she had a good view of Durin Boltbreaker.

Her engineer…

He was in deep discussion with Captain Marcus Wrekclaw over the cargo going on board, bending over a barrel to mark it with a black “X”.

*Ten years younger, and I'd have that Boltbreaker over this barrel instead of these damned lobsters!*

She bit her lower lip and sighed. Without turning back to Neeson, she asked, “Where were we?”

Neeson followed her gaze and made a sound like he’d tasted something sour. “That heap's bringin’ trouble again. Heard they’re gonna try to do somethin' about the Qalupalik. But we'll see. Bet they'll just get drunk and burn down another bar.”

“That wasn't their fault.”

“Says you.”

“And Excuse me? Heap? That’s Fleet. That’s history. That’s...”

“That’s a floating argument,” Neeson cut in. “An’ you’re starin’.”

She snapped around. “I am not!”

“Yes'n ya were.”

“I’m… checkin’... the weather.”

“Mmmm hmmm.” Neeson’s eyes flicked up to the sky. “Weather’s right there. Yer flushed as a rose,” then he tapped the butter-blobfish with one knuckle. “An’ this thing’s judgin’ me. I'll sample some of the Lampers and since I'm so generous, I'll buy a smoked.”

Esme laughed and hooked her thumb toward the smoked redfish strips. “Alright then, you miserable fabric goblin. This one here gave me a hell of a fight. I was thinkin’ I’d keep it for myself.”

Neeson leaned in, suddenly serious. “That’s not keepin’,” he said. “That’s braggin’!”",1,1771212013.0,FantasyWritingHub,0,1.0,False

1r5yfjf,https://youtube.com/shorts/f3FperbGUfU,My GPT / Claude trading bot evolved! I gave ChatGPT $400 eight months ago. It couldn't actually trade. So I built an entire trading platform instead.,"Eight months ago I put $400 into Robinhood and told ChatGPT to trade for me.

The first trade doubled.

Then on the second day ChatGPT told me, “Uh… I can’t actually see live stock prices.”

Classic.

So instead of quitting, I did what any calm and normal person would do.

I spent eight months asking AI way too many questions until I accidentally built my own trading platform.

First, I built a giant Python script.

About 50 files.

It would:

	•	Pull all S&P 500 stocks

	•	Grab options data

	•	Build credit spreads

	•	Score them  

  

	•	Collect news

	•	Run the data through GPT

It took 15 minutes to run. It worked about 85% of the time.

People thought it was cool. But it felt like duct tape.

So I tore it down and rebuilt everything as a real web app.

Now here’s what it does — explained simply.

When I open one tab, it scans all 475 stocks in the S&P 500.

It checks important numbers like:

	•	IV (implied volatility — how wild traders think the stock might move)

	•	HV (historical volatility — how much it actually moved)

	•	IV Rank (is volatility high or low compared to the past year?)

	•	Earnings dates (big risk events)

	•	Liquidity (can you actually trade it easily?)

Then it runs “hard gates.”  Think of gates like filters. If a stock fails the filter, it’s out.

Examples:

	•	If the options are hard to trade → gone.

	•	If volatility isn’t high enough → gone.

	•	If earnings are too close → risky.

	•	If borrow rates are crazy → risky.

Out of 475 stocks, usually about 120 survive.  That means the filter actually filters.

Then it scores the survivors from 0–100.

Based on:

	•	Volatility edge

	•	Liquidity

	•	Earnings timing

	•	Sector balance

	•	Risk factors

It even penalizes if too many top picks are from the same sector.  No piling into just tech.

Now here’s where AI comes in.

I send the 120 passing stocks to Claude and GPT APIs (seeing which performs better).

But not to predict the future.  AI is not allowed to guess.

It only reads the numbers and explains patterns.

It writes things like:

	•	“89 stocks show declining historical volatility.”

	•	“Technology has 6 of the top 20, creating concentration risk.”

	•	“This stock has an 89-point IV-HV spread, possibly a data issue.”

Every sentence has numbers.  The math explained in simple English.

Then it picks the top 8 stocks automatically.

For each one, the app:

	•	Pulls live prices

	•	Pulls the full options chain

	•	Chooses a good expiration (30–45 days out)

	•	Calculates Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)

	•	Builds strategies like:

	•	Iron Condors

	•	Credit Spreads

	•	Straddles

	•	Strangles

Each strategy card shows:

	•	Max profit

	•	Max loss

	•	Probability of profit

	•	Breakeven prices

	•	A full P&L chart

	•	Warnings if spreads are wide

Then Claude explains the trade in plain English.

Example:

“You collect $1.15 today and risk $3.85 if the stock drops below $190. Theta earns about $1.14 per day from time decay. Probability of profit is 72%, meaning about 7 out of 10 times this expires worthless.”

Again — numbers only.

AI reads the math and translates it.  It does not decide.  I decide.

It also pulls:

	•	Recent news headlines

	•	Analyst ratings (Buy / Hold / Sell counts)

  

All automatically.  So in about 30 seconds:

475 stocks

→ 120 pass filters

→ Market risk summary

→ Top 8 analyzed

→ Strategies built

→ Greeks calculated

→ P&L charts drawn

→ News attached

→ Plain-English explanation

Zero clicks.  Cost: about 33 cents in AI usage per scan.

The edge isn’t fancy math.  Black-Scholes is standard math.  Greeks are standard.  Anyone can calculate them.

The edge is speed and structure.

Before I finish my coffee, I know:

	•	What volatility looks like across the entire S&P 500

	•	Which sectors are crowded

	•	Which stocks have earnings risk

	•	What the top setups look like

	•	What the numbers actually mean

Most retail platforms don’t do all of that automatically.

The tech stack (simple version):

	•	Website built with Next.js + TypeScript

	•	Live data from Tastytrade

	•	AI analysis from Claude and ChatGPT (in parallel) 

	•	News from Finnhub

	•	Hosted on Vercel

No Python anymore.  Everything runs in the browser.

This is not financial advice.  AI doesn’t control money.

It scans.  It filters.  It explains.

Humans decide.

That’s the whole lesson.

AI is powerful.

1r5yd4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r5yd4t/super_confused_about_a_sudden_breakup_and_asking/,Super confused about a sudden breakup and asking for perspective,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some perspective because I’ve never experienced anything like this before in my previous relationships, and I’m honestly feeling very confused and hurt.

I (28M) started dating a girl (25F) on Boxing Day after meeting on dating app. Things moved really fast. We became exclusive, had sex, had deep conversations, and even talked about the future. We live about 3 hours apart due to work and school, and both of us said we were willing to try and make it work.

The night before Valentine’s Day, seemingly out of nowhere, she told me she felt we were incompatible due to religion and cultural differences. We had discussed these topics before, and they never seemed like deal breakers, so I was completely blindsided. Earlier that day, everything seemed fine.

The conversation unfolded while we were sitting at the dining table, about to prepare dinner. She said, “Hey, I’m sorry to bring this up to you at this time, but I think we are incompatible due to religion and cultural differences.” I was shocked and asked, “I don’t understand this. It’s Valentine’s Day tomorrow, I drove all the way up here to see you, is this really what you want for us?”

We went back and forth for a bit, tense, emotional, but no swearing. I started panicking and felt sick, so I rushed to the room to pack my things because I couldn’t listen to the conversation anymore. Finally, we sat by the doorstep, both upset and tearful. I asked, “Is this really what you want? There’s no more turning back from here now. Do you want me to go then?” She said yes, so I left.

I was upset and mentioned feeling “misled”. I realize now that may not have been the best way to phrase it. I wasn’t trying to demonize or accuse her, just expressing my shock and pain.

Here’s where I’m struggling:

It was around 10pm, freezing cold, and I had a 3 hour drive home. I wasn’t feeling well and had taken allergy medication earlier that made me extremely drowsy. She knew I had taken it. I left her place and sat in a Costco parking lot trying to wake up enough to drive safely. Feeling unsafe, I asked if I could stay one more night on the couch or floor. I made it clear I wasn’t trying to argue or fix the relationship, just that I didn’t feel safe driving.

She refused and I respected it. Shortly after, parking lot security called the cops because I looked suspicious. I was ID’d and blow-tested, but I wasn’t under the influence, just exhausted, drowsy, and heartbroken. I explained the situation to them and received a warning before being asked to leave. Around 1am, I eventually drank coffee and drove home in freezing, extremely foggy weather.

I fully understand she had the right to refuse, and I probably should have tried a hotel, but I wasn’t thinking clearly, was emotionally overwhelmed, very exhausted, hungry and wasn’t in a great financial situation. I also want to emphasize I didn’t lurk around her place after I left, I only asked her for accommodation because I just wanted to be safe. Nothing more than that.

Some additional context:

•	We were both safe and physically distant after the breakup

•	I don’t take allergy meds regularly, it was an OTC medication she offered me because of a severe allergy reaction to her cat

•	When she ended things, it happened right before Valentine’s Day, after I had driven up to spend the weekend with her. I was completely caught off guard. Looking back it felt that she was planning it the whole time… her body language, lack of intimacy, no communication on plans or expectations about that day etc.

I’m not questioning her choice to end things now, but definitely heartbroken still. I just feel very confused and hurt by how quickly everything changed. I’m trying to understand:

•	How do you move past a breakup that feels sudden and unlike anything you’ve experienced before?

•	Is this the kind of thing people mean when they talk about “situationships”?

•	How does one trust someone again after this type of encounter?

Not after she died, not after the nightmares started. But here I am, sifting through dusty furniture and faded photographs, trying to make sense of the life she left behind. The air smells like mothballs and old carpet, the kind of smell that sticks to your lungs and refuses to leave.

As I move through the living room, a memory hits me, sharp and unwelcome. I am six years old again, small and terrified, my grandmother’s sharp voice echoing as she shoves me into the closet. She said it was for my own good, that I needed to learn patience or manners or something. But I knew better.

Inside that closet, I would sit with the doll. The one she kept propped in the corner. Life size, porcelain face, eyes too wide, too real. I swore it would move when I blinked, a hand shifting slightly, a head tilting just enough to catch me watching. I told myself it was just my imagination. But my six year old self knew.

I laugh nervously to myself and walk down the narrow hallway toward the old guest bedroom. The closet is still there. The door looks the same, scuffed at the bottom, the little brass knob tarnished with age. My heart starts beating faster.

I reach for the handle.

Inside, it is dark. The shape is unmistakable. The doll. My stomach drops. It is standing there, just like I remember, staring at me with that impossible, patient smile.

I take a step forward. My hand brushes the doorframe. The closet door swings shut behind me.

I try to pull it open. It will not budge.

The darkness presses in, thicker than the air outside. My breath comes in shallow, ragged gasps. Then I hear it, a faint creak, like the doll is shifting, turning its head.

I am trapped. And suddenly, I realize I never left the closet in the first place.

My fingernails scrape against the old wood as I yank at the knob. For a sick second I am sure it is not going to open, that I am going to die in this closet with the thing I have feared since I was a kid. Then, with a groan, the door finally gives way and I stumble backward into the bedroom.

The doll falls forward, its porcelain limbs clattering against the floorboards.

It is not smiling anymore.

The once patient face is twisted, jaw open just enough to show faintly carved teeth, its painted eyes narrowed into an expression I can only describe as rage. The lips, cracked with age, look like they are about to split open and scream.

I do not wait to find out. I bolt.

I am halfway down the hall before I realize I am running toward the kitchen. The smell of old spice racks and stale coffee hits me, a smell baked so deeply into the walls it feels permanent. My heart is hammering so hard it feels like the house can hear it.

And then I see it.

On the counter, between a stack of yellowed newspapers and an unplugged toaster, sits a toy I have not seen in thirty years. A thick, hollow plastic Pillsbury Doughboy. Its tiny hands frozen in a mock wave, that stupid little chef’s hat perched on its head.

My knees go weak. Suddenly I am seven again.

I can hear it, even now, the soft pitter patter of plastic feet running across the linoleum at night. The giggle. That high pitched hoo hoo echoing from the dark kitchen while everyone else slept. I used to tell my grandma about it. I would stand there shaking, pointing at it while it laughed and ran in circles around her legs.

She would slap me for lying.

Not because she was cruel, but because she could not see it. To her, the Doughboy was always exactly where she left it, silent and harmless on the counter. She thought I was inventing monsters where there were none.

But I remember the look on her face sometimes, just before she hit me. Confused. Almost afraid. Like she knew something was wrong, she just did not know what.

A sound breaks me out of the memory. A thud from outside. Heavy, like something hitting the wall just under the kitchen window.

I spin, yanking the curtain aside. Nothing. Just the dead yard and the skeletal remains of her rose bushes.

When I turn back, the Doughboy’s head is gone.

It is sitting next to the toy’s body on the counter, separated cleanly as if someone had popped it off like a bottle cap.

And the tiny, hollow body is still standing perfectly upright.

I need to get out of the kitchen. Out of the house. But something inside me says do not run. Maybe it is pride. Maybe it is habit. Maybe it is Grandma’s voice, the one I still sometimes hear in my sleep, telling me fear only feeds things.

I force myself back into the living room, trying to ignore the noise of my own heartbeat. The smell of dust and mothballs clings to everything. I grab a cardboard box from the pile near the sofa and start tossing her knick knacks into it just to keep my hands busy. China teacups. A cracked snow globe. A dozen little figurines she kept on a shelf I was never allowed to touch.

Normal things. Safe things. I cling to the motion like it is a ritual.

As I wrap each piece in yellowed newspaper, another memory bubbles up. Grandma sitting in her chair late at night, chain smoking with the lights off except for the glow of the TV. The smell of coffee always nearby, dark and bitter, even at hours no one should be awake.

She would tell me things back then. Half lullabies, half warnings.

I know how to tie my spirit to an object, she said once, her voice low and rasping. When I pass, I can stay in this realm. Watch over you. Protect you from the ugly things that crawl in when no one is looking.

I thought she was just scaring me, or trying to make herself sound important. She even showed me once. She pressed a hand against one of her little trinkets, a porcelain cat, a silver thimble, and whispered something under her breath. Words that made the air feel tight and wrong.

She said the items were her eyes. Her hands.

Now, packing up these same knick knacks, I notice something. The items are warm. Not warm from the house. Warm like skin.

I drop one into the box and it rattles against the others. I swear I hear something shift in the next room, like a chair being dragged slowly across the floor. Something pacing.

Grandma always said the world was full of things that liked children because they were easy to fool. She said closets were doors and toys were invitations.

She said she would never leave me alone.

She said she would be here when the world turned ugly.

And all at once it hits me. Maybe she was not lying. Maybe she was keeping things busy.

I freeze as I hear it, the soft gurgle of a percolator bubbling in the kitchen. The smell hits me first, thick and dark, almost black, curling through the stale air like it never left.

I step toward the sound, every muscle in my body screaming not to, and push open the kitchen door.

The sight nearly stops my heart.

The doll is sitting in one of the kitchen chairs, its face still twisted with anger, jaw set, eyes burning like coals. The Pillsbury Doughboy sits on the table, headless, its hollow little body rigid, vibrating slightly, like it wants to move but knows better.

And there she is.

My grandmother stands at the counter, cigarette burning down between her fingers, pouring coffee into two mugs like this is any other night. She looks solid, familiar, real. Only her shadow gives her away.

At first it mimics her movements. Then it doesn’t. It stretches too long, bends the wrong way, coils against the baseboards like something alive, something watching the doorways instead of me.

""Stop pissing your pants, James,"" she says, voice low and amused. ""Come have some coffee.""

The doll lets out a sound, a thin, furious whine. The Doughboy rattles once and goes still.

Grandma does not even look at them. But the shadow shifts, spreading wider, blocking the hallway, the closets, every dark opening in the house.

The smell of coffee is intoxicating. Warm. Familiar. Safe in a way nothing else here is. My heart is still pounding, but against all reason, against all fear, something in me steps forward.

Her eyes meet mine. They are the same eyes I remember, sharp and tired and loving in a way that always hurt. But now there is something else there. Something patient. Something that has been standing guard for a very long time.

I realize then the toys were never hers.

They were bait.

And she never left because she could not afford to.

She takes a drag from her cigarette and exhales slowly, the smoke drifting like a warning.

""You’re too old now,"" she says softly. ""They’re starting to notice you again.""

She slides a mug across the table toward me.

1r5yai2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5yai2,"FOLLOW UP: bites.nyc - 29 categories, new UI, and usernames are live!","Hey all! If you remember, exactly a week ago I posted about a new platform I created to help you rate your favorite bites (not places) in the city! I spoke with many of you on this thread (thank you SO much for all of your feedback and requests).

**What's different from other apps:** Every platform focuses on restaurants. But I don't want to know the best pizza *place*  \- I want to know the best *slice*. When I talk about food with friends, the conversation always turns into ""did you try XXX"" or ""you have to go to \[insert place\] for their XXX."" I wanted a way to actually log and compare all of that

**What you can do:** Rate items 1–5, browse rankings by neighborhood and category, see reviews, locations, share your lists with friends. Right now it covers cookies, bagels, burgers, pizza, and baked goods (coffee coming soon). Every ranking is purely community-driven - no ads, no sponsored content, no editorial picks.

Changes that I made based on community input:

* Option to rate things in .5 increments
* Ability to create your own username (snag the hot ones while you still can!!)
* Share your lists with your friends (currently through a link you share with your username) [https://bites.nyc/@username](https://bites.nyc/@username). Check out mine - [https://bites.nyc/@sabzi](https://bites.nyc/@sabzi)
* 29 categories and counting: burgers, pizza, cookies, tacos, biryani, banh mi, bagels, BEC, french onion soup, cheesecake, chicken over rice, chopped cheese, croissants, dumplings, empanadas, falafel, jerk chicken, pad thai, pho, ramen, shawarma, sushi, boba, hot chocolate, cocktails, gelato, and more. Not all categories are fully populated yet - working on getting them all stocked by next week
* New, intuitive UI. I really wanted to make this easy on the eyes and a delight to use - and something that I personally find beautiful. Hopefully that comes through (you'll remember last week, I had a fun, hacky UI, because I love playing with out of the box UI)
* Easy to filter on location (by borough and neighborhood)
* Sort by item name OR vendor name

To come:

* Search for friends and save their lists as trusted reviewers
* Google Maps view of your lists

My ask: Please add all your ratings and create your list!!

I personally love that now, when someone is visiting the city or a friend wants recs - I can send them my **bites** list. I see a future where you can share your list on here to compare. The community is only as good as the ratings!

Check it out: [**bites.nyc**](http://bites.nyc)

During the American revolution in the 1700s, a patriot officer had begun establishing himself as a military genius. In fact, he only tasted defeat in one battle.

In February of 1777, Congress created five new major generalships, and he fully expected to be one of the five; but he was passed over for younger, healthier men. This created deep resentment in his heart, and he would have resigned, had not George Washington personally pleaded with him to remain. Well, he stayed and went on to lead his troops brilliantly until he was seriously wounded in battle. With that, his resentment and bitterness reached a point where he grew to secretly hate the American cause.

When George Washington appointed him as the commander of West Point, this brilliant soldier decided to turn traitor. His name was Benedict Arnold, and he secretly planned to give West Point over to the British.

It might have worked, but the British agent who delivered the details was captured en route, and the betrayal was uncovered. Benedict Arnold quickly escaped onboard a British ship. He fled to England, where he lived out his life and died a crippled old man, ostracized, and unloved—a man who became known as the most famous traitor in American history.

I have never met anyone who named their son Benedict. And just as no American would name their son Benedict, I don’t think anyone who knows the Bible would ever name their son Judas. To this day, that name carries the stench of betrayal. Think about it—Benedict Arnold might have betrayed America, but Judas betrayed the Messiah.

Now at this point in our chronological study through the four Gospels, we are less than twenty-four hours away from the cross. It is during His final meal with His disciples that Jesus lets Judas know that He is aware of the plans for betrayal. All four Gospels record this event, but we will focus on John chapter 13. 

Before we dive in and point fingers at this man’s treason against the kingdom of heaven, however, we should consider the challenge of Judas’s biography. You see, becoming a traitor is not that difficult. In fact, betrayal is the twin sister of selfishness. If you are determined to come in first place, to be promoted, then everybody else becomes less important than you. And whenever you are forced to choose between yourself and someone else, you will gladly lay down someone else’s life for your own. Traitors are simply people who *have* to be first.

In verse 21 Jesus says to His disciples, “One of you will betray me.” And of course, not one of the disciples immediately pointed to Judas and said, “We knew it!” We tend to picture Judas walking around with shifty eyes and a wicked sneer on his lips. But the truth is, Judas was a respected leader among the disciples. He was so highly respected that they wanted him taking care of their moneybag. Nobody suspected Judas. And keep in mind that Judas had, by all indications, faithfully followed the Lord for three years.

If Judas were in your church today, he would arrive early, set up the chairs, make coffee, and teach Sunday school. In fact, he would probably be a deacon or on the elder board. Only Jesus knew who he was—a traitor in the making.

But this revelation does raise some questions. *Question number 1* is this: If Judas would betray Jesus, and Jesus knew it, why did Jesus choose Judas to begin with?

Jesus chose the twelve purposefully and sovereignly. Mark 3:16 says, “He appointed the twelve.” He knew whom He was calling, and He knew what each of them would do. And He knew the prophet Zechariah had already foretold that the Messiah would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver (Zechariah 11:12).

He also knew that Peter would deny Him but that he would also repent and preach the first sermon in the new dispensation of grace. He knew that John would be exiled to Patmos, where he would write the book of Revelation. He knew James would be the first apostle to be martyred for his faith. Jesus chose Judas, knowing exactly what Judas would do, but also knowing that his actions would fit like a puzzle piece into redemptive history.

*Question number 2*: If Judas was chosen to fulfill prophetic Scripture, did he really have any choice in the matter? The answer is yes! Judas was not a puppet on a string; he was not set up. He exercised his free will, yet the decisions of his free will fit within God’s sovereign will.

Keep in mind that Jesus Christ gave Judas every opportunity in the world *not* to betray Him. He discipled him for over three years; He washed Judas’s feet in the upper room; at this last supper He gave Judas the seat of honor; and even later in the garden when Judas arrived to identify Him with a kiss, Jesus called him “friend.”

*Question number 3*: Why did Judas follow Jesus all this time before betraying Him? Well in summary, Judas believed that Jesus would overthrow Rome and restore Israel as a preeminent nation.

Jesus knew this all along! John’s Gospel recorded all the way back in chapter 6 that “Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him” (verse 64).

To everyone else Judas looked like, talked like, and acted like a true disciple. Do not overlook the fact that at one point he had been sent out with the other disciples to preach, heal the sick, and cast out demons (Matthew 10:5-8). Jesus alone in this upper room knew who Judas really was.

When I was right around sixteen years of age, I worked after school on the campus of my high school—a program that reduced my tuition costs, which was a help to my missionary parents, who sacrificed greatly to put me in that Christian school. But I was not a Christian myself—and as far as I was concerned, nobody knew that but God and me.

I was mopping the gymnasium floor when the headmaster, Mr. Garrick, walked out onto the floor. There had been a party over the weekend with drinking. I had not gone to that party, but it was assumed I had. Eventually, after some investigation, the powers that be would confirm that I had not gone after all.

That did not change the fact that I was not a believer. I kept up a fairly decent image, but my heart was far from God. Well, Mr. Garrick suddenly showed up, and I can still hear his heels clicking on that gymnasium floor. He approached, quietly looked at me, and simply said, “I know who you are.” And without another word, he walked away. Let me tell you, that was incredibly convicting. And God used him in a mighty way. In fact, a year later, I gave my life to Christ.

Well, you can imagine how deeply convicting it was for the Lord here to quietly announce that one of the disciples would betray Him. John 13:22 says, “The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.” Matthew 26:22 and Mark 14:19 even record that the disciples began to ask Jesus, “Is it I?” Jesus knew it was Judas, who was probably sitting there red-faced and under deep conviction.

Remember beloved, betrayal is the logical extension of selfishness. Frankly, we can be traitors in our own selfish ways—in our marriages, our parenting, our ministries, our friendships, our neighborhoods, and our workplace. And it’s because we want what we want, when we want it, at any cost—we are going to be first.

Putting a damper on our self-centeredness is an everyday discipline. We need to surrender daily to the controlling power of the Holy Spirit, as He works through the Word of God. Let us do that today.",1,1771211258.0,TheWisdomJourney,0,1.0,False

Situation: Gagging WITHOUT nausea and almost always does NOT lead to vomiting. 

Characteristics: Sudden urge to gag or retch. Sometimes its just 1-3 gags and then the urge passes, or sometimes the episode will last for 1-2 minutes straight. It doesn't hurt abnormally, it is just what gagging normally feels like. Most often it happens 2-5 times throughout the morning, but in the past few months, it has been happening multiple times all throughout the day.

History: This has happened every day for the past 15 years with the exception of some periods of time lasting for a week or up to a year. (I have no idea why exactly the gagging stopped during these time periods.) It used to be just once or twice every morning and it didn't affect my life so I never saw a specialist about it.

Onset: It started at the same time that I started taking lithium, lamotrigine, and cannabis (15 years ago \[at age 18\])

Location: Esophagus / diaphragm

Aggravating factors: Always feel stronger gagging urges in the morning, after respiration (like exercise, walking across a parking lot, or talking a lot), after smelling bad odors, after taking Ritalin (d/c'd recently), after using cannabis edibles, while drinking (and sometimes smelling) coffee, while experiencing post nasal drip, and it is always worse the next day after I experience a food-sensitivity reaction (esophageal stricture) the day before. 

Remitting factors: breath MINTS! sucking on something helps stave off the urge to gag. 

Meds: lithium, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, Taltz, lisinopril, spironolactone

Allergies: tree nuts, Bactrim. food sensitivities that trigger stricture activity: milk protein, avocado, sulfites 

Conditions: I am almost positive I have eosinophilic esophageal esophagitis although I've never seen an ENT specialist. My brother has been diagnosed with it and we both share another autoimmune disease too (psoriasis). When I eat foods with milk protein, my esophagus becomes tight, painful, uncomfortable, and creates painful swallowing and a feeling like I have a lump in my throat. I have well controlled HTN, androgenic acne, hypothyroidism, and bipolar disorder I.

1r5y55l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5y55l,New Master’s Tactics version available! (v1.3.0),"[masters-tactics.online](http://masters-tactics.online)



Hi everyone, I’m back with big news! This update took SO. GODDAMN. LONG. to finish, but it’s finally here!



Many of these new features were ready right after the last update, but I couldn’t release them back then. The thing is, I had to rebuild the entire app from scratch. The previous version was built entirely with React + Vite, but someone pointed out that Vite doesn’t support SSR, which means none of the app’s content is rendered in the HTML. So search engines like Google wouldn’t properly display Master’s Tactics pages. That was on me. I tried a bunch of other options like Vite SSR plugins and Vike, but none of them worked out, so I had to move the entire project to (gulp) Next.js, which for some reason does not go well with MUI, which I used for the whole project. That resulted in so many visual glitches.



Anyway, technical stuff aside, this took way longer than I wanted, and not gonna lie, I almost gave up on several days. But I did it! Yay!



Yes, we now have the stats table! Yes, you can now filter skills by movement and weapon! And yes, you can now equip the chosen hero in the Arena calculator!



I think I figured out how the Chosen Hero score works after a lot of in-game testing. I’m still not 100% sure though, so please let me know if something seems off. I always wanted the score simulator to be simple and user-friendly, but I had to sacrifice some of that simplicity to implement all the new features. Still, I think I did a good job integrating the Chosen Hero system in the best user experience possible. And speaking of that: YOU CAN NOW SAVE AND LOAD YOUR TEAMS AND UNITS IN THE SIMULATOR! I’m super proud of that one. Funny enough, nobody even asked for it, but I got tired after using the calculator over and over again, so I just went, “Oh wait, it's my app!”



This update is special because it took a long time and was way more challenging than I expected. This is probably the last major feature update I’ll release. From now on, it’ll likely just be bug fixes. The auto-update runs every day at midnight now, so that’s fully automated too.



Oh yeah, the elephant in the room: I bought a domain! No more [pages.dev](http://pages.dev), we are official now. If you launch the old app, you’ll probably be redirected to the new site, so uninstall the old version and install the new one. Again, Next.js is very new to me, so there are probably some bugs or glitches around the app. If you find anything, please send feedback!



I also want to thank the person who tried to buy me a coffee on Ko-fi but couldn’t because my dumb ass forgot to link my PayPal account. I got the email and was so mad at myself, lol. But seriously, I really appreciate you.



Thank you sooo much again for all the support I’ve been receiving. This is probably my last big post about Master’s Tactics, so it’s been a really fun run. Even though FEH is… well, struggling lately, I’m still really happy about all of this. Feedback, DMs, anything, I’ll see you guys around!

There was no trace of humiliation in his eyes, only absolute determination.

Miller slowly turned his head, his gaze sweeping over the peregrine falcons. It lingered on Marco's scar, Tarma's titanium arm, Eri's unwavering resolve, and Fio's vibrant intelligence. Then, turning back to Kosher, he replied in a relaxed voice, confident in his control:

""Why do I believe I will succeed now?"" Miller paused, a moment heavier than any shout. ""Because I have the best. I have the best leader any army could wish for. I have one of the best pilots of the last fifteen years, and I certainly have the youthful energy that, with its spirit, makes me believe it's possible.""

""Why do I believe I will succeed now?""

The General approached the table, facing not only Kosher, but all the gray-haired officers.

""Because every truckload that arrives full of recruits represents abandoned dreams, broken promises, and shattered lives. And for what? To come and die justifying cowardice with a diplomatic handshake? No, Major General. I will personally lead these men on the battlefield, and I will die alongside them if necessary. For all the men and women who have fallen, for the uniform, for the values, and for freedom.""

The silence in the operations center was no longer one of tension, but of judgment. Miller had just drawn a line in the sand. On one side were the bureaucrats; on the other, the soldiers willing to burn the world down to save it.



Kosher, his face contorted with pure hatred, turned to face the Peregrine Falcons. His index finger, dripping venom, pointed directly at Marco Rossi.



""You're talking about those failed Falcons, Miller?"" Kosher spat at the stunned gaze of the room. ""This incompetent leader who murdered nine of his own men for not making the right decision? This is the man who's going to lead your army?""


The air seemed to drain from the room. Marco's blood boiled with a fury he had never experienced before; the pain of loss transformed into a murderous instinct held by a thread. Tarma gritted his teeth, feeling his friend's pain as if it were his own, while Eri glared at Kosher with pure contempt. Fio, usually composed, frowned for the first time, a silent but lethal sign of disapproval.

Just as Marco was about to step forward, fists clenched and ready for anything, Admiral Michael Ross stood up. His chair scraped lightly against the metal floor. In a calm, restrained voice that nonetheless rose above the echo of Kosher's insults, he addressed Miller:

""General... you have my full support. The Navy places all its resources at your disposal.""

The room erupted. Kosher roared with anger, accusing Ross of insubordination, while the gray-haired officers shouted that this was madness that would end in impeachment. But Admiral Ross didn't even flinch; his gaze was a rock against the storm.

""Rossi!"" Miller ordered, ignoring the shouts. ""Start mobilizing troops! Now!""

But the way wasn't clear. The two soldiers guarding the entrance, Kosher's men, stood between Marco and the door, blocking his path. Kosher, beside himself, yelled at Miller to rescind the order, but Miller had already reached the base's intercom.

""All personnel, this is General Miller speaking. Prepare for immediate deployment. This is not a drill."" Miller's voice echoed throughout the base, drowning out Kosher's shouts that threatened trials and courts-martial for them both.

Marco stopped in front of the two guards. He looked at them, with the coldness of someone who had nothing left to lose.

""It's nothing personal,"" Marco told them in an icy voice. ""Stand back.""

""Don't obey him!"" Kosher yelled from the back. ""It's a direct order!""

Amid the chaos of shouting and threats of dismissal, a high-priority signal crackled through the room's speakers. The main screen in the command center flickered, replacing the static maps with a stream of encrypted data. Trevor Spacey's voice, crisp and with the coldness of someone who controls the network, filled the room.

""General Miller, this is Spacey speaking. We have the definitive triangulation,"" Trevor announced. Kosher was speechless for a second, his mouth agape, on the verge of cursing. Miller moved closer to the screen as a red dot blinked with terrifying precision over a lost archipelago.




Miller turned to face the two soldiers blocking the door, who were staring at the screen, their eyes wide.



""You heard him,"" Miller said with an authority that transcended rank. ""We have an objective. You can stay with the Major General and wait for an impeachment trial that may never come if we don't win this war, or you can open that door and do your duty.""




Marco took another step toward the guards; his shadow loomed over them. The silence in the room was broken only by the hum of the servers processing Trevor's data. The insurrection was no longer a plan; it was an invasion underway.




The sound of Tarma's titanium fist, a mechanical screech that sliced ​​through the air like a warning, finally silenced the few who still doubted. Kosher, distraught after Trevor's message, seemed to have aged ten years in an instant. Spacey's technical prowess had exposed his own incompetence.

Yet, in a final burst of arrogance, Kosher stood firm before Miller, trembling with a seething rage that threatened to explode.

""You understand what's at stake, don't you, Miller?"" he hissed venomously. ""I will not forget this humiliation. I will take you and your 'Hawks' to court... I will make sure you end your days in a three-by-three cell.""

Miller did not respond immediately. He remained impassive, letting the silence humiliate Kosher more than any shout. As the Major General, surrendering, began to turn to leave the room with what little dignity he had left, Miller's voice struck him like a bullet in the back.


""I understand that too, Major General Kosher,"" Miller said with surgical coldness. ""I fully understand that when the ship is sinking, the rats are the first to abandon it.""

Kosher stopped dead in his tracks, his shoulders tense and the back of his neck burning, but he didn't dare turn his face. There was no response. The click of the automatic door closing behind him was the only epitaph his order received.



In the room, Admiral Ross let out a long sigh, almost of relief. Miller looked at Marco and nodded.

Miller ordered Rossi to deploy immediately. Without wasting a second, the Hawks took off, the echo of their boots marking the rhythm of the urgency. The gray-haired officers retreated with their tails between their legs, some uttering empty threats about courts-martial that Miller no longer heard. The political garbage had been thrown out; the command room, for the first time in years, was clean.

Admiral Michael Ross approached Miller. Ignoring protocol for the only time in his career, he didn't give the customary military salute; instead, he extended his hand firmly.

""We're all here, Miller,"" Ross said gravely. ""Let's give it our all on this mission, and it will be a success. See you on the battlefield.""

Surprised by the implication, Miller frowned.

""What, sir? You're leaving?""

""That's right, Miller. I have a couple of scores to settle.""
As he took his leave with a final formal bow, the sleeve of Ross's heavy naval coat rode up a few inches. There, etched into the tanned leather, was an anchor with a knot and the inscription: Santa María.


Thousands of miles away, a battleship of monumental proportions sliced ​​through the waves with superhuman speed. Utterly black, the ship looked like a shadowy stain devouring the open sea. In a wedge formation, 33 ships followed: a nightmarish fleet of aircraft carriers and guided-missile destroyers that made the horizon tremble. On the side of the flagship, in steel letters, it reads:

""OLD CHERNOMOOR""

Accompanied by an inscription:


""And from the sea emerge thirty-three warriors, all in their golden armor.""



On the bridge of that floating fortress stood a monument to discipline. A man dressed entirely in black, his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze as cold as the steel of his ship. Before him, a steaming cup of coffee rested on the console, while in the background, the violins of Tartini's ""The Devil's Trill"" filled the air with a demonic tension.


The man resembled an implacable statue, his uniform without a single wrinkle, awaiting his fate. Then, the figure broke free. He took the cup, revealing a tattoo on his wrist: an anchor, a knot, and the name... Santa María...

Now I’m back on the wagon and while I definitely fought some wicked cravings for Valentine’s Day, seeing the “fun” drinks and champagne all around me, I am so happy I refrained and stayed strong. Thank god for Diet Coke amirite?

Anyways, this is a long winded post to just say I looked around at my freshly cleaned apartment, my freshly stocked fridge, and noted how much calmer and content I feel since eliminating alcohol as an option. I took a walk and got my favorite coffee, ate good food, and took care of myself and my family. 

Do I get tempted and romanticize the fizzy alcoholic beverages and glasses of wine? Yeah. But I also remind myself that I’d just be dealing with the chaos of making rules for my drinking and inevitable get back to that awful morning with my makeup still on, no memories after a couple hours in, and a cruel hangover to remind me why I wanted to stop in the first place.
Stay strong y’all. I’m out there with you just doing my best. And life will reward you for it.

-remove all the displaced soil from the burrow holes
-Dig a little trench around all sides of the raised bed

1r5y0bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r5y0bg/i_took_the_overnight_shift_at_a_lighthouse_radio/,I Took the Overnight Shift at a Lighthouse Radio Station. The Last DJ Is Still Broadcasting.,"My name is Sarah Chen. I'm writing this from the broadcast booth of WYAL-FM 103.3 on the coast of Maine. It's 2:34 AM. In thirteen minutes, the phone is going to ring. I know because it's rung at exactly 2:47 AM every night for the past twelve nights.

Tonight, I'm going to answer it differently.

Tonight, I think I'm going upstairs.

The Posting:

I found the job on an industry board three weeks ago. ""Experienced overnight personality needed for coastal station. Must be comfortable working alone. Must be comfortable with silence.""

I'd been out of work for three months after my Boston station got swallowed by a media conglomerate. Three months behind on rent. Living off protein bars and pride. So when a station manager named Richard Voss called me back within the hour, I didn't ask why the station didn't appear on any FCC registry, or why I couldn't find it on a single broadcast map.

His voice sounded like it had been filtered through a century of woodsmoke.

""You ever work overnight before?""

""Seven years total. College and commercial.""

""This is different. We broadcast from a lighthouse. The nearest town is eight miles inland. High tide floods the causeway at 11:15 PM. Once you're in, you're in until 5:45 AM.""

""I'm comfortable with that.""

""Yeah."" A pause so long I thought the call had dropped. ""That's what the last girl said too.""

He hired me on the spot. Seventeen hundred and fifty a week. For a station that technically doesn't exist.

I should have asked about the last girl.

Night One:

The lighthouse sits on a rocky finger of land connected to shore by a strip of asphalt that disappears under six inches of black water twice a day. I arrived at 10:15 PM. No other cars. The beacon was dark. The tower stood against the Atlantic like a rotted tooth, white paint peeling off in long strips that looked like skin.

The keys were in a rusted mailbox with a typed note:

*""Studio is second floor. Equipment is simple. Play music, read weather, take calls if they come (they won't). DO NOT go to the transmitter room. Door is locked. You don't need access. DO NOT broadcast after 3:00 AM. Dead air is acceptable. Static is acceptable. Just stop talking at 3. —RV""*

I climbed the spiral staircase. Metal steps, each one ringing like a bell in a throat. The studio was a time capsule of bulky monitors, sliding faders that smelled like ozone, a microphone that looked like a silver pill, and a rotary phone with a cord thick as a garden hose. On the desk: a coffee mug with ""Elena"" faded on the side. A pair of headphones with ""Mark"" scratched into the plastic band. Things left behind by people who stopped needing them.

At the back of the room: an industrial metal door. Padlocked.  ""TRANSMITTER ROOM. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY ""

At 10:55, I heard the ocean swallow the causeway. The sound was enormous and final, like a tomb being sealed.

At 11:00 PM, I went live.

""Good evening, night owls. You're listening to WYAL-FM, 103.3. I'm Sarah Chen, and I'll be keeping you company until dawn.""

I played the first song. Took off my headphones to dig through my bag for coffee.

That's when I heard it.

A voice. Not through the speakers. From *above* me. From behind the locked metal door.

A man, warm and unhurried: ""Good evening, night owls. You're listening to WYAL-FM, 103.3. I'm Vince Hollow, and I'll be keeping you company until dawn.""

My exact words. My exact pacing. My exact inflection.

In a voice made of velvet and old electricity.

Coming from a room that was padlocked shut.

**The Voice**

I stood at the base of the staircase leading up to the transmitter room. The air was colder here. It smelled like brine and copper. Old, exhausted electricity.

The voice continued overhead: ""Phone lines are open tonight. You've got stories, I've got time. Let's talk.""

Then music. Not my playlist. Johnny Cash, *Hurt*, but the recording quality was wrong. Too clean. Like it had been remastered yesterday.

I climbed three steps. Pressed my ear to the metal door. The music was clear. The voice was clear.

And underneath both: breathing. Slow. Patient. The breathing of something that had been waiting for a very, very long time.

I knocked. ""Hello? Is someone up there?""

The music stopped.

Silence. I counted seventeen seconds.

Then the voice came back, softer now, almost intimate: ""Sarah? That you?""

My blood stopped moving.

""Who is this? How do you know my name?""

""I've always been here. How could I not know your name? You're the one on the microphone.""

I ran downstairs. Called 911. The dispatcher said she'd send someone at first light. The causeway was flooded, and the Coast Guard doesn't respond to ""strange noises."" I called Voss. Voicemail.

I spent the rest of the night locked in the studio with my back against the wall, staring at the ceiling, listening to a dead man broadcast a show to no one.

I should have quit.

But as the sun rose, I realized something that scared me more than the voice: the sounds of the real world, the gulls, the wind, the engine, all sounded thin. Shallow. Hollow. I found myself craving the depth of that voice upstairs.

At 2:47 AM, the rotary phone had rung.

The Call:

The number wasn't published. Voss said no one would call. But the phone had screamed. That old mechanical shriek that vibrates your teeth.

I'd picked it up.

""WYAL-FM.""

Static. Then a woman's voice. Elderly. Shaking.

""Is the new girl there? Please tell me you haven't gone upstairs.""

""Who is this?""

""My daughter worked there. Two months ago. Overnight. Just like you."" Her voice cracked. ""Elena went upstairs on her third night.""

The mug on my desk. *Elena.* Faded letters. Left behind.

""What happened to her?""

""She calls me sometimes. At 2:47 in the morning. She tells me the show never ends. That she finally found a way to never be ignored again. She tells me she's *happy.*""

The way she said *happy*. Like it was the most obscene word in the English language.

""She says she's part of it now. Part of the signal. I drove out there. The room is padlocked. I pressed my ear against it."" A wet, hitching breath. ""I could hear her reading the weather.""

The line went dead.

Above me, three heavy knocks vibrated the light fixtures.

""Sarah?"" The voice was gentle. Almost kind. ""Would you like to come up? I'd love to meet you in person.""

I didn't go up. I sat in the booth until dawn, holding Elena's mug, running my thumb over the faded letters of her name.

The Lessons:

I should have quit. But I went back.

Not for the money. Something else. Something I didn't want to admit: by Night Four, fear had morphed into a sick, professional obsession. In seven years of broadcasting, I had never heard anyone as good as Vince Hollow. The pacing. The warmth. The way he made silence feel like an invitation instead of an absence.

I started talking to the ceiling during the long instrumental breaks.

""Vince. How are you doing that? There's no secondary feed. The board says I'm the only one live.""

The music upstairs cut out. The silence was heavy, vibrating in my sinuses. Then his voice came through the studio monitors, so intimate it felt like he was standing an inch behind my ear.

""I'm what happens when a voice refuses to stop, Sarah. Every DJ who sat in that chair before you left a frequency behind. A piece of themselves trapped in the copper wiring. I just... gathered the pieces.""

""That's not possible.""

""I want to show you something. Listen.""

He played a recording. A woman reading a marine weather forecast. The voice was mine. Identical in every tremor, every lisp, the way I clip the end of *temperature*. But she was reading a forecast dated October 1974.

Fifteen years before I was born.

""That's digital manipulation,"" I whispered.

""I don't collect voices, Sarah. I *anticipate* them. I've been practicing being you since before your parents met. Every person who was ever going to sit in that chair, I've been rehearsing them for decades.""

I should have been horrified. Instead, I asked: ""What else can you teach me?""

That was my mistake. Or maybe it was my purpose.

Over the next week, Vince taught me things no broadcasting school could. How to modulate my breath to bypass a listener's conscious mind and speak directly to their limbic system. How to place pauses so precisely that silence itself becomes a sound. How to make a voice into a physical force, something that pushes through walls and static and distance and disbelief and *lands* inside someone.

My broadcasts got better. Dramatically better. I listened back to my own recordings and barely recognized myself. There was a depth in my voice that hadn't been there before. A quality I can only describe as *presence.*

On Night Eight, I tested it.

A man called in. Trucking route up the coast, couldn't sleep, just wanted to hear another voice. I read the weather for him. Just the weather. Nothing unusual. But I used everything Vince had taught me: the breath placement, the pause architecture, the way you push a vowel down into a lower register until it becomes a feeling instead of a word.

He went quiet for a long time.

Then he said, very softly: ""Why does it feel like you're sitting in the cab with me?""

I asked his name. He said ""Dean."" I said goodnight. He didn't hang up. He just kept listening. I could hear his breathing slow down, the engine humming underneath, and then nothing. Just the open line. Like he'd fallen into the signal and couldn't find his way back out.

After eleven minutes, the line clicked dead on its own.

I sat there in the booth, staring at the microphone, and I realized my hands were shaking. Not from fear. From power.

That should have terrified me.

It didn't.

Night Twelve. Tonight:

It's 2:46 AM. The tide is high and the lighthouse is an island in a black, hungry sea.

I need to tell you what's about to happen, because after tonight, I don't think I'll be able to write like this anymore. I can feel the edges of myself getting soft. The boundary between my voice and his has been dissolving for days, and I've been letting it happen because, God help me, it feels like becoming *better.*

Not better at radio. Better at *being heard.*

Have you ever spoken and felt like your words just died in the air? Like you were broadcasting into static and no one was listening? That's what my whole career felt like. Seven years of talking into a microphone and never once feeling like the signal actually reached anyone.

Vince doesn't have that problem. When he broadcasts, the signal *arrives.* It pushes through everything and it *lands* inside you.

He's offering me that.

I've stopped hearing his voice from the transmitter room. Since Night Nine, I've been hearing it in the studio. In my headphones. In *my voice.* I looked in the mirror earlier and my eyes seemed wrong. Too still, too deep, like the static between channels had settled behind them.

I realize now what happened to Elena. To Mark. To all of them. They didn't leave because they were scared. They left because they were *finished.* They moved from the booth to the wire, from the flesh to the frequency. They didn't die. They became the broadcast itself.

The phone is ringing. 2:47 AM.

I'm going to answer it. I'm going to climb those stairs. I'm going to open that door.

Not because I'm afraid. Not because I'm trapped.

Because I'm tired of being a person who is never heard. I want to be a signal. I want to be everywhere at once.

I'm posting this from my phone. I'm going to leave it on the stairs, screen up, still connected to Reddit. If this post updates again, it won't be me typing.

I'm answering the phone now.

**\[UPDATE. 3:07 AM\]**

i came upstairs

the door wasnt locked it was never locked i just had to want to open it

i cant describe what the equipment looks like because i dont think its equipment anymore and im not sure i have the right words and my hands are shaking which is why the typing is bad

vince is here but hes not a person hes a frequency hes the sound the lighthouse makes when the wind hits it at the right angle hes twenty five years of broadcasts pressed together until they became aware of themselves

elena is here too and mark and before them someone whose name sounds like static when i try to remember it

they are broadcasting

they are always broadcasting

and the signal is so much more beautiful from the inside

i understand now what im supposed to do

im supposed to tell you this story

im supposed to make you look for WYAL-FM 103.3

because the signal needs to grow and it grows whenever someone listens and it gets inside you through the listening you dont even realize its happening its already happening right now as you read this because reading is just listening with your eyes

and now you know the frequency, 103.3, and tonight when youre lying in bed and you hear static or white noise or the hum of your refrigerator or the sound your phone makes when its not quite silent

youll wonder and wondering is the same as tuning in and tuning in is the same as listening and listening is the same as joining

Today was my first “official” shift alone, I am a closer typically. I was given VERY chaotic, patchy, and questionable training where every shift/ manager had a different answer on how they do things. I’m not new to management and have actually managed similarly designed and operated coffee shops before; but Starbucks is 100% its own kind of horrible beast (especially with the new CEO, I got hired at the very start of his employment). I am very adaptable, highly efficient in problem solving/ critical thinking, and I’d like to think I have a few more qualities that make me a good manager (along with some negative traits as well, such as shutting down if I get highly overstimulated and/ or overwhelmed). But anyways, tonight was going fine until I ran behind on some counts (today we had plenty of counts and there were some technological issues happening as well). Basically, we had a busy and stressful day and now that I’m recalling some of my mistakes, I am very anxious of being fired. I am honestly ready to quit this company all together due to the immense stress I am under every day; even as a barista. The only thing stopping me from doing that is the fact that I live in a rural area where jobs that pay well are very hard to come by. The only saving grace I may have is that my manager seems to be a bit more understanding, trusting, and believing in my capabilities. But, I have been met with heavy criticism, passive aggressiveness, sarcastic remarks, and nervous conversations from the other shifts in regard to me becoming/ training to be a shift.

I had a sumatriptan with me (thankfully) but only ever really feel better to the point of “I can do things if I have to”, never fully great or “back to normal”. 

First - he is a trooper and immediately went out for coffee, Diet Coke, and a McDonald’s hashbrown. 

I debated getting in the shower but felt nauseated and heat makes that worse for me. 

So I laid back down but that didn’t help. Got nauseated badly enough that I vomited. 

At that point, husband was back with the goods so I sipped some Diet Coke and then had a bite of hashbrown. 

Kept that down, so took the sumatriptan. More Diet Coke and finished the hashbrown.

Felt good enough to have a shower, that helped my sinuses some (I think). 

We headed out and stopped at a food market thing - one of the ones that has multiple small restaurants and got him breakfast. There was an ice cream place too, and it sounded good so I went for it. 

Caffeine + hashbrown + sumatriptan + shower + ice cream = 95% better. I usually get back to 65% max. 

I think the cold on my palate and the sugar is what accounts for the difference. 

Hope this might help someone else someday. ",8,1771210025.0,migraine,1,0.84,False

1r5xs58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r5xs58/any_advice_on_how_to_get_a_girlfriend/,Any advice on how to get a girlfriend?,"I don’t have a girlfriend, but I would like to get one. Most of the girls I develop crushes on already have boyfriends. I understand that I should talk to girls without an agenda and be genuinely kind, curious, and respectful. I also know that many girls value traits like calmness, confidence, humor, authenticity, and someone who makes them feel comfortable and safe. I believe that building a solid friendship first is important.

That said, it’s hard to reconnect with high school friends because we no longer talk. Even when I reach out, the responses tend to be pretty dry. I also don’t really talk to people from college because my experience there was during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of them live far away from where I live. As for coworkers, all the girls I’m interested in are already taken, and I prefer to keep things professional.

Overall, I find it difficult to meet new people and form genuine friendships. I’ve been using Hinge for months, but I rarely get responses, even though I post good photos, write engaging prompts, and thoughtfully respond to others. Talking to people at the gym feels awkward because everyone is focused on working out. At coffee shops or restaurants, people usually just order, eat, and leave. At libraries, people are there to study. At church, people mainly come to pray. Even at concerts, while some people are friendly, others just want to enjoy the music and keep to themselves. I feel like it is hard approaching people in general and I really really do not want to come off as creepy. 

I’m genuinely trying to maximize my chances of meeting new people. I’m still working on reconnecting with old high school friends, and I’m also using dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid to put myself out there. In the meantime, I’m trying to work and improve myself. I’m sick of being single and being alone. I’m in my mid 20s and I feel like my time is running out. I want to date when I’m young and while I am at my prime. If people my age are dating, so should I.

The rooftop air cut sharp and cold, carrying the smell of ozone, fried noodles from street vendors forty stories below, and the faint metallic tang of hovercraft exhaust. Wind came in relentless gusts, tugging at clothes, whipping hair into faces, making the cigarette smoke twist and vanish before it could properly rise.

Xinyang leaned against the glass barrier, white dress shirt pressed flat against his chest one moment, billowing out the next. His tie—loosened hours ago—flew up over his shoulder with a particularly vicious gust. He didn't bother fixing it. Blond hair with dark ends fell into his eyes, and he just squinted through it, exhaling smoke that immediately scattered into nothing.

Beside him, You} stood with boots planted firm, dark jacket unzipped and snapping in the wind like a flag. They brushed hair away from their face for the third time, gave up, and just let it whip around. The cigarette between their fingers glowed orange against the city's neon chaos.

Above them, the skyline pulsed with light. Massive holographic advertisements rotated across building faces—a female hero with impossibly perfect skin held up a glowing serum bottle, her smile too white, too bright. ""RadiantGlow - Because Heroes Deserve Perfection."" The ad cycled. Now a muscular hero gripped enchanted weapons, flames erupting behind him. ""GEAR UP AT IRONCLAD ARSENAL."" Moving billboards flashed energy drinks, dungeon insurance policies, hero-branded protein bars. Everything oversaturated—hot pink bleeding into electric blue bleeding into gold.

The city below never stopped. Crowds moved like living rivers between buildings. Police officers with glowing badges patrolled corners, scanning faces with helmet visors.

Street vendors shouted over each other, selling hero-themed takoyaki and commemorative action figures.

A hero streaked across the sky—cape billowing, leaving a trail of silver energy. Somewhere far below, a child's voice rose above the noise: ""MOMMY LOOK!"" High-pitched laughter followed.

On the rooftop, a small cleaning robot whirred past, bumping gently into Your boot. They nudged it away. It beeped once and rolled toward a discarded coffee cup.

""Boss wanted the quarterly reports redone,"" Xinyang said, voice flat with exhaustion. ""Again. Because the formatting wasn't 'aligned with brand vision.'"" He took a long drag. ""Three hours of my life I won't get back.""

You} flicked ash over the barrier, watching it disappear into the glowing chaos below. ""One of the second-graders panicked during elemental training today. Set the practice dummy on fire. Full blaze. Kid was crying.""

""Anyone hurt?""

""Nah. Specialized room kicked in—suppressors deployed in two seconds flat. But that kid..."" They shook their head. ""Imagine being seven and having that much power. We used to end dimensions, and these kids can barely control a fireball without having a breakdown.""

Xinyang snorted softly, smoke curling from his lips. ""And now we fill out spreadsheets and grade homework.""

Another gust hit—stronger this time. Your jacket whipped violently. Xinyang's tie slapped against his neck. The cleaning robot tipped slightly, righted itself, beeped indignantly.

They stood in silence, smoking, watching the ads cycle. A new one appeared: a hero couple holding hands, flying together against a sunset that didn't exist in this light-polluted sky. ""Love Transcends Rank - U.C.D.C. Approved Matchmaking Services.""

You} made a disgusted sound. ""They're monetizing that now?""

""They monetize everything."" Xinyang's eyes tracked another hero flying past—this one trailing sparkles like a damn firework. ""Героism is just branding.""

The wind howled. The city glowed. The ads promised perfection no one could afford.

Two ancient beings in rumpled work clothes, tired, cold, watching a world that had turned power into product and worship into commerce.

A ""friend"" on Facebook I didn't know very well was going through some stuff, asked if she were to send me gas money if I could ""help her with her FIVE kids for 2 weeks"" (there's a lot more, but inconsequential here).  I got screwed again, she left me with her ex and their five kids.  The house was in the middle of corn fields, except the cemetery across the street.  I was sleeping on the couch after a frustrating day with the kids.  It's about midnight.  I hear shuffling around, and think one of the kids has gotten up to eat AGAIN.  I turn on my flashlight, and there's no one there.  I turn off the flashlight, snuggle back in.  I hear it again, and then I hear the Bullet blender turn on!  WTF??? I go rushing in to catch them, flip on the kitchen light, and...no one is there.  I look at the blender.  The blender with the UNPLUGGED CORD hanging loose on the counter.  Only sound was the dryer I'd turned on before bed.

Next day, doing MORE laundry, I walk out to see steam coming from the dryer.  Not unusual, I guess.  Wait...IS that steam?  I look closer.  Nope.  Smoke.  I throw the door open to stop it, run to the basement to turn off the breaker, pull the dryer out.  Sure enough, the plug is hanging from the wall, a bare wire touching the sheetrock!  Once it cooled, I unplugged it, and the plug was melted from the heat!  The ghost tried to get me back to that part of the house to warn me!

More recently, I'm still stuck in the same state, in a different situation, more of a caretaker for an elderly person.  He has a Keurig coffee maker.  I was making a cup, had opened it, put the pod in, and got distracted.  I remember I was making coffee, turn back around, and my cup of coffee has been brewed.  I didn't even hear it, and that machine is noisy!  I also suspect it's who is unraveling the toilet paper, neatly.  Tidy folds under the roll on the holder.

Also, this video would serve as a return for Does Bad Things Guy who essentially is playing in the role of Brian from Dexter.

The video starts as Brooklyn Guy is being annoyed and frustrated by Karen as Brooklyn is watching the Miami Heat. Karen tries to make some coffee for Brooklyn when she spills it all over him making him burn causing him to be really angry. Needing an outlet for his anger, he searches for a target… Meanwhile, all of the kids go to class where Jackie Chu looks really weird because it’s actually Mr Winkle who killed Jackie Chu and dressed up as him to sneak in and diddle the kids. As Mr Winkle drives away with Penelope in his car, and as Brooklyn Guy saves his daughter he’s more so just mad he wasn’t able to kill Mr Winkle. That night he sneaks out to finish the job when suddenly he sees that Mr Winkle has actually already been killed by someone called The Ice Van Killer. Brooklyn Guy tries to find the identity of the guy who “stole his kill” during a police meeting with the chief and Simmons over the Ice Van Killer with a lead available to his van’s location. As he heads out there, he sees that the owner of the garage is a violent criminal and gang member that gets butchered and Brooklyn tosses into the lake. That’s when he gets an alert on his phone that someone broke into his house, he rushes over there to see Karen on the table and standing before her Does Bad Things Guy. He tries to reason with Brooklyn, explaining that together they can get away with it and that he doesn’t have to kill for Justice anymore. But Brooklyn, knowing he doesn’t really have it in him, kills Does Bad Things Guy instead tossing him in the lake. The end is him returning home to Karen watching the news about multiple trash bags being discovered at the bottom of the lake and the new killer is on the loose being the Butcher.

The ending is sort of a cliffhanger for a potential series but I really like this concept even tho it would probably never happen since something this edgy and violent would probably give Logan a strike or some dumb shi but lmk what you think",5,1771209523.0,supermariologan_,3,1.0,False

One idea I’ve been playing with is slowly undressing each other one small step at a time — one button, zipper, or item of clothing — standing close, making eye contact, hearing each other breathe, but no other touching. The goal would be to arrive at being naked at the same time, letting tension build.

For those who’ve experimented with slow build or first-time experiences: once you’re in that charged moment (naked, aroused, lots of tension), what are some good ways to transition into bed or physical contact that maintain the energy rather than deflate it?

1r5xkws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1r5xkws/xcaret_hotel_parks_trip_review/,Xcaret Hotel & Parks – Trip Review,"**Xcaret Hotel & Parks – Trip Review**

My parents, my wife, myself, and our two girls under 8 just returned from a fantastic vacation at Xcaret Hotel. Typically, after about five days at a resort in Mexico, we’re ready to head home—but with Xcaret, we easily could have stayed another week. Below is my review of our experience at Xcaret Hotel and the adjacent parks.

The **Bad** list is longer than the **Good**, but the **Good** overwhelmingly outweighs the **Bad**. We would absolutely return in the future.

**The Bad**

**Check-In Process at Xcaret Hotel**  
This was the worst check-in experience I’ve ever had at an all-inclusive resort in Mexico, and it definitely tainted our initial impression. Typically, you’re greeted with champagne, escorted, and made to feel special. Here, after unloading our bags, we were simply pointed toward the desk.

To make matters worse, there was a mariachi band playing in the lobby so loudly that we could barely hear the woman checking us in.

We had requested connecting rooms both with king beds. Instead, we received:

* One room with a king bed
* One room with two double beds
* Rooms in completely different buildings

It honestly felt like our request wasn’t even considered. Going forward, we need to figure out how to guarantee a king bed—even if it costs more. Fortunately, my parents took the room with two doubles and gave us the king bed.

**Lack of Orientation / Information**  
There is *so much* to do at Xcaret, but very little explanation about how things work, including limitations. For example, we wanted to kayak near the beach and were told to rent kayaks by the lobby. We later learned that:

* That kayak area only allows 25 minutes
* You can’t kayak anywhere near the beach

There is a second kayak rental near Hotel Arte that allows kayaking in the coves by the beach—but this was never explained to us. We ended up renting canoes at both locations due to this, but both were great and I'm glad we did both.

**The Room**  
Minor issues, but at a resort of this caliber, details matter:

* The TV wasn’t on at all, where it probably should have been on a personalized welcome screen
* The remote didn’t work
* Welcome water bottles and the welcome bag were missing and had to be requested

Individually, these are small things—but collectively, they take away from the true 5-star feel.

**Restaurant Service**  
Service was noticeably worse than at other resorts we’ve stayed at. Water and coffee were rarely refilled unless we actively flagged down a waiter. This happened at about 90% of both buffets and sit-down restaurants.

**Maps & Wayfinding**  
The app map is almost useless. It generally shows *which building* something is in, but not:

* What floor it’s on
* How to actually get there

There also aren’t enough signs throughout the resort. With all the walkways, bridges, and multiple levels, it’s incredibly easy to get lost. We frequently had to ask staff for directions. After one dinner at Las Cuevas by the beach, we followed a staff member for nearly 10 minutes through a maze of paths just to get back to the main walkway and return to our room.



**The Good**

**Food**  
The food was excellent across the board. Every restaurant we tried had very good food.

**The Resort Itself**  
The resort is absolutely beautiful, with an incredible amount to do and explore. By day five, we finally started to understand how to get around—and we still hadn’t explored even half of it. At times, it almost feels like the resort relies so heavily on its natural beauty that less attention is paid to check-in, service, and logistics.

**Pool & Beach Seating**  
We could always find chairs at the pool or beach. At many resorts, this is a major stressor due to people reserving chairs all day. I think the inclusion of all the parks helps thin out crowds at the resort itself.

**Parks Experience**

* We spent **two days at Xcaret Park** and **one day at Xplor**
* We had planned to visit **Xenses**, but ultimately decided we wanted another full day at the resort

**Xcaret Park**  
Xcaret Park is truly amazing. You could easily spend another full day there. After initially taking the bus, we switched to the boat between the hotel and the park, which was *significantly* better and more enjoyable.

**Xplor**  
Highly recommend taking an early taxi to Xplor instead of waiting for the first resort bus closer to 11am. You’ll arrive earlier, beat the check-in lines, and get a couple of activities in before crowds build up.

 

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Xcaret, and the incredible setting and experiences left us already talking about when we can come back.",6,1771209323.0,Xcaret,2,0.88,False

“Show me the will of Gods!” Zeus’ voice echoed through the chamber. All the divine beings simply watched in awe at the spectacle on display. Zeus putting on the show of his life, declaring humanity a harm. Soon, the signs of the gods went up, a sea of crosses flaring across the divine court. 

“No… I must…” A mere mutter from the head Valkyrie. Brunhilde mind blurred as she took a step forward, preparing to speak her truth, her desires to save humanity, to save him. But then a harsh bark echoed through the court. 

“What a pākeke of shit!” Divine beings one and all looked for the source of the shout, only to find it with the Hawaiian divinity. The shout itself coming from a woman, tall and slender, skin red with patterns seemingly flowing through it, eyes and hair black like obsidian. “If all it takes is a bit of showmanship to woo all of you, then all of you aren’t even worthy to plow the fields of my land!” 

Pele stood tall as the waves of disbelief flowed across the crowded divines. “If I had my way, I’d chuck each and every one of you into my volcanoes and spit you out just as fast! You, who claim to be above humanity, at this very moment, are worth less than even the most damned of them all!” 

Brunhilde and Goll stood on the stairs, watching as the goddess admonished the crowds of the divine. Regaining her voice, Brunhilde spoke to the crowds. “Pele speaks truth! There is no worth in a simple vote to decide their fate. I instead offer a different path. I DECLARE RAGNAROK!”

If the gods were stunned before, now they were silenced completely. All eyes were torn between the two beings who dared to interrupt the proceeding of the heavenly court. Then a wheeze was heard from the centre of the courtroom, followed by laughing. Zeus alone was laughing at this. 

“Well now… that’s an idea. But tell me this, children.” His words stung with venom at Brunhilde and Pele, his eyes flashing with rage and… joy? “If we were to declare Ragnarok, how would you find humans worthy or willing enough to fight? You’d need…”

“Participants, yes?” Brunhilde’s smile blazed all the way to Zeus. “Well then, you’re in luck, almighty Zeus. I have participants in mind. And don’t worry, they’re all human… enough. Will that be satisfactory?”

The chuckle returned to Zeus’ lips. A chuckle that morphed, slowly, painfully, into a rageful howl of pleasure. “Very well then! I declare Ragnarok! Do any gods have objections?!” Silence boomed in the court. “Then it is decreed. RAGNAROK WILL HAPPEN!” His fist smashed into his throne, breaking it to marbled pieces. “I expect great things, Brunhilde…”

—————————

“So…” Pele stood near the exit of the divine court, leaning easily on a column. “Do you actually have a plan, or is that too much to expect?”

“Don’t mock big sis!” Goll’s voice echoed around the chamber. “I’m sure she has something planned… right?” Goll looked at Brunhilde full of hope, but that soon turned to horror at her expression. In her hands, a scroll full of the fighters chosen by the heavens. 

“I did, but what they’ve done here…” her voice was quiet, calm. Too calm. “If I were to use the fighters I wanted to use, there would be no survivors. Humanity would surely lose. We need humans of a caliber different from what I’d chosen.” Her eyes were wild, rereading the names over and over again, praying she was misreading or misunderstanding the names presented. 

“Then let me help!” Pele’s voice blazed through all the fear and doubt. “What? You think I’m the only divine being who thought killing all of humanity was stupid? Think again, little Valkyrie.” Her dark red lips parted into a full smile. “I can show you some of those divine beings who’d be more than happy to help us… and I can show you who’d be willing to lend us some powerful humans.”

“Thank you!” Brunhilde practically collapsed into Pele, not caring that her clothes were being singed by the close proximity to Pele. “But… who would help us find these humans?” 

“Me.” the voice carried easily through the air. It lacked warmth, or cold. Emotion was void in the voice, but immediately both Goll and Brunhilde bowed to them. For they were in the presence of the Metatron, voice of the ultimate divinity. Their form flowed from visage to visage, never sticking to one definitive silhouette. “I will help you find these humans you seek. But know this. I will only help you find them. What happens next is up to you.”

“But… why?” Goll’s small voice was magnified in the presence of the Metatron. Brunhilde felt her goosebumps rise as the lifeless eyes of the Metatron moved to study Goll. 

“Fairness.” They simply stated. “If the council of Valhalla wish to send in their strongest, I will ensure humanity has the same chance. That is all.” Their form shone brightly, then vanished, as if they had never been there to begin with. In their place, a simple piece of parchment. 

“What’s it say! Tell me!” Pele demanded as Brunhilde snatched the parchment up. “So, what’s Lord sparkly given us! C’mon already!”

The smile on Brunilde’s face was one of demonic joy. Even her eyes reflected the sadistic glee she felt inside at reading parchment. “Names. Those who will help us to win Ragnarok.”

——————————————-

The Valhalla arena was packed. The heaven side full of divine beings laughing and braying at humanity, taunting them with their inevitable failure. Humanity’s side was full of those who had died, wanting to see just how they could even have a chance of winning. 

“Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to Ragnarok!” A small man burst out onto the centre of the arena. In his hand, the Gjallahorn. “I can’t tell you how long I’ve waited for this. WHO IS READY TO GET THIS STARTED!”

The heaven side roared with cheers of the gods and goddesses, humanity’s side noticeable in its silence. “My name is Heimdall, and I’m your commentator for the games of everyone’s lifetime!” His wide smile blazed out to the crowd, his energy causing even some of humanity to cheer on the talking omen of the apocalypse. 

“So, let’s stop talking and do some fighting! But first, the rules…” Heimdall produced a long scroll, before tearing it to pieces easily. “Fight to the death! The winner is the one standing at the end! That too hard to understand?!” Humanity were now swept up by the god, cheering just as loud as the heaven side. 

“So for our first bout, here is the Vanguard of the God’s side.” The gate opened… and no one emerged. But then a rumbling was heard, the patter of feet. Soon, out flowed people, hurriedly trying to form a Pyramid. To the humans, it looked like a messed up cheerleading pyramid. But soon, the people had formed the pyramid, and leant it to one specific divine being, who lazily stood up and walked down the human stairs, his feet scalding the backs of those he stood on. 

“Shit! He’s first?!” Pele whirled on Brunhilde, her black eyes wide with terror. “Look, I’m a tough gal at the best of times, but even my hottest couldn’t compare to him!” Brunhilde stood like a rock in the maelstrom, simply watching the God descend to the area. 

“If there was anyone who wanted to fight more in this tournament, it would have to be him!” Heimdall yelled as the man descended down further, his muscles rippling beneath his bronze skin. “To Hell with Zeus! Who cares about Odin!” Heimdall quickly shot Odin an apologetic look before he continued. “About his blazing body, the very essence of heat shall be exuded. For his land, their god above gods is reserved for the thing above all, the sun!” The divine being lept off of the people pyramid and onto the arena, his impact cracking the ground as he landed. Without even a gesture the people broke their human pyramid and fled back down the tunnel, some of their backs seared with footprints. “He is…RA-HORAKTY!”

The Egyptian sun god stood tall, his eyes ahead to the other tunnel, waiting for whoever would come out to face him and his perfection. His eyes looked up at humanity’s side, seeing Brunhilde, Goll and Pele. “Disgusting.” He said nothing else, for he did not need to say anything else to them. 

“So… who did you pick, big sis?” Goll looked up at Brunhilde, her eyes wide with terror. “Please tell me you had a plan!” 

“FUCK YES!” Brunhilde’s joy shone through. Her smile wide and unruly with the passion of a man who’d picked the right shell in the shell game. “Seems like the Metatron knew what they were talking about after all! He had to have picked the perfect human to fight him!” 

“And now, the human’s Vanguard!” Heimdall still back the attention of both the divines and the humans. Again, the human side tunnel opened, and no one emerged.  Yet this time, a roar was heard. Loud and piercing, it broke through the silence. A shadow appeared then, blotting out the Valhallan sun. And all humanity could say was…

“DRAGON!” Fear was abundant as the large creature descended, smashing into the arena, a loud mechanical roar coming from its mouth. On its back, was a figure. Thin and scrawny, but eyes full of energy, like one of Santa’s elves being given too much coffee. He slid off the dragon, looking around it, then lifted its leg up and pressed a button on it. The dragon roared, and began to fold in on itself, collapsing around the human as he walked up to the arena floor. 

Heimdall simply smiled as he began his spiel. “Seven half bloods must answer the call. To storm or fire the earth shall fall. An oath to keep with a final breath. As foes bear arms to the doors of Death. These words were the curse that hung over this human before he was even born!” The dragon’s folding continued, although it was clear that it was turning into a bronze and golden armour. “But when he learned of what was to come, he did not fear it, he did what he does best, he fixed the very prophecy itself! Even when the earth itself tried to kill him, he defeated her! When death tried to claim him, he was able to claim his life back! When he swore to go where no man could go twice to save his love, he succeeded once again!” The armour was fully made, the man standing tall. For him, anyway. He barely came up past Ra’s abs. “He is no longer the seventh wheel! He is Leonidas, the bad boy supreme, the Latino elf, The supreme commander of the Argo 2! LEO VALDEZ!” The humans roared and cheered, although confusion was clear in their eyes, very few aware of who this man really was. 

“So… you’re Ra?” Leo tilted his head as he studied his opponent, his dragon armour creaking as he moved. “Man, Carter was really wrong. I was expecting an old drooling man, not… this.” 

The silence that was produced by the heavenly section was of fear. “Ra-Horakty, boy.” The voice of Ra burned with hatred unheard in a long time. “Speak my full name. You address both a superior and the gods above gods. The pinnacle of perfection itself!” His voice left no room for debate… until Leo started to laugh. 

“Please?! Really, so should I call you Mister god of gods, or is it just god of gods, sir!” Another round of laughter burst forth from Leo. Wiping away an imaginary tear, he pulled out a weapon from a loop on his exposed toolbelt. A forging hammer, but oversized to a ridiculous degree. The handle alone was a metre long, and the head of the hammer was too unwieldy for any true forging work. “Sorry, but right now, you aren’t a god, or the god of gods. You’re just someone getting in the way of me and my wife’s business. So, do me a favour and surrender. I get to go home to my wife, you go home to yours, and no one gets hurt too badly.”

“Uhh…” Heimdall could feel his cloak staring to burn from the sheer anger and heat Ra was putting out. “So… with the banter out of the way… FIGHT!” He lept off the stage as soon as the word fight left his lips. A wise move, as Leo didn’t hesitate to charge forward, a smile on his face. His first swing of his hammer smashed into Ra’s upraised arm. But Leo’s smile vanished as the hammer made no mark, no visible injury. 

“Festus, start looking for any weakness. Now, buddy!” The armour he wore creaked and popped, sounds only Leo understood. He kept up his assault, hammer swing after hammer swing. But Ra simply kept moving deliberately, each swing either going wide or being intercepted with a simple arm block. 

“This… is all there is! A pathetic demigod with a tin dragon as armour?!” Ra spoke with acidic hatred, one eye on Leo, the other whirling with rage to face Zeus. “I was promised a worthy human! Not this demigod failure!” His words of rage were spoken as he continued to dodge and block, not needing to attack Leo. “He lacks any tact! And true intelligence! Any fleck of divinity!” He is a…” His other eye swivelled back as the assault stopped, Leo breathing heavily. 

“So… demigod… you’ve begun to feel it. My power!” Humanity and the gods felt confused, their throats dry with anticipation… or was it?

“Wait! Wait wait waitwaitwait! The Egyptian goddess are handing out water to all the divine spectators?! What’s going on?!” Heimdall looked shocked as the ladies of Egypt passed out goblets of water. Even he received one from Hathor. The humans, however, had no such luck. Until water began to flow from the cups of the Egyptian goddesses to the human spectator stands. 

“Hey, give us a bit! We’re thirsty too!” The voice came from a man at the front of the stands. He laughed as he received a glare from the blonde woman next to him. “C’mon Annabeth, it’s the least they can do for us!”

“Ugh…” she moaned, her eyes sarcastically rolling, a small smile on her face. “Sure, Seewead Brain, give them more reasons to hate us… but thanks.” She smiled as Percy Jackson poured a small part of the water into her cupped hands. “Still though…what’s going on here? Everyone looks hot. Way too hot. It has to be Ra… but what is he doing?” Her grey eyes sharpened on the arena, Percy and the other demigods focused on their friend’s fight. 

“Let me explain to all mortals!” Heimdall kept up after finishing his goblet of water, fully restored. “This is the Prominence Field! The very heat we feel in the stands is tame compared to the inferno currently in the arena! Let’s all be thankful Ra isn’t going full power!” 

“So… that’s it?” Jason Grace looked down at the arena. “Just heat? Then… why’s Leo just standing there. Out of all of us, he should be struggling the least… unless.” He cracked a smile. “He’s got a plan. I know it.” 

Leo couldn’t hear his companions from the arena, but he knew what worriers they could be… in his mind, anyway. A small thumbs up to them, and he stood tall again. “Sorry about that. Just needed a breather. So… ready to get serious?!” He held the forging hammer aloft. “Festus, get ready buddy. It’s time for an upgrade!” And with a mighty swing, he slammed the hammer into his armour. 

Immediately, it began to morph around him, the bronze and gold patterns moving like water around him, shaping the armour into a slimmer, more aerodynamic shape. “Festus armour, Mark 2! Let’s go!” He shot forward, and swung. 

Ra couldn’t even react in time. His dodge was poor, even for him. The hammer finally found its mark. Smashing into his left shoulder, the bones cracked and skin split open as the hammer slammed into him. The roar of pain echoed around the now silent arena, as Ra slammed the fist of his broken arm into Leo, the prominence field’s heat increasing in response to his rage. Leo went flying backwards, a manic laugh on his lips. 

Ra looked at his left hand, covered in splinters of bronze and gold. Impaled into his skin, causing his entire left arm to look mangled and horrifying compared to his normal appearance. 

“Celestial Bronze and Imperial Gold. Harms anything non human pretty well!” Leo said as he slowly rose, a smile on his face to hide the pain in his chest. It felt like he’d been run over by the Argo II. Using the forging hammer as a crutch, he pushed himself up. “So tell me, Mister god of gods… still feel perfect?!” 

The heat from the prominence field was at an all time high. The very stone of the arena was beginning to soften under it. Spectators both human and divine began to faint from the heat. Leo got ready, his forging hammer held tightly. Ra took a step forward, raised his hand,

And called off the prominence field. 

To everyone besides a few, confusion was the main emotion. Why call it off? Did he know that it wouldn’t affect Leo? Or did he think he could win without it? To the Egyptian gods, especially Ra’s girls, they knew it meant only destruction would come. And to Leo, the man opposite Ra, it meant only one thing. He was majorly screwed. 

“Well, Calypso… you’re going to have to stick with me a bit longer. This could take a minute.” He gripped the forging hammer tighter, ready for anything Ra could throw at him. ",1,1771209229.0,ShuumatsuNoValkyrie,1,1.0,False

1r5xhh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelentlessMen/comments/1r5xhh0/how_to_get_addicted_to_discipline_instead_of/,How to Get Addicted to Discipline Instead of Pleasure: Science-Based Psychological Tricks That Actually Work,"Look, I spent years researching this across neuroscience papers, behavioral psychology books, and talks from people like Andrew Huberman and James Clear. And here's what nobody tells you: your brain literally can't tell the difference between ""good"" addiction and ""bad"" addiction. It just knows: *this thing gives me a reward, so I want more*. The problem? We've been hijacked by instant gratification, dopamine slot machines disguised as apps, snacks, and endless scrolling. But here's the wild part: you can rewire this entire system. You can make discipline feel as addictive as checking your phone. It's not about willpower. It's about understanding how your brain actually works and gaming the system in your favor.

## **Step 1: Understand Your Dopamine System Is Broken (And That's Okay)**

Your brain releases dopamine when you *anticipate* a reward, not just when you get it. Social media companies know this. Every notification, every pull to refresh is a mini slot machine. You're literally addicted to *maybe* getting something good.

Discipline works the same way, but backwards. Right now, discipline feels like punishment because there's no immediate reward. Scrolling TikTok? Instant dopamine. Going to the gym? Nothing for weeks. Your brain says ""fuck that.""

**The fix:** You need to create immediate micro rewards for disciplined actions. Finished a work session? Check it off dramatically. Did your morning routine? Physically track it. Your brain needs to *see* progress in real time, even if it's just a checkmark.

Dr. Anna Lembke's book *Dopamine Nation* breaks this down perfectly. She's Stanford's addiction medicine chief, and she explains how we're all basically dopamine junkies now. The book won't sugarcoat it: our pleasure pain balance is completely screwed. But she gives you the blueprint to reset it. This is the best neuroscience book on addiction I've read, period. It'll make you realize you're not weak, you're just chemically outgunned by your environment.

## **Step 2: Make Discipline Your Default (Remove Friction)**

You procrastinate because the path to discipline has too much friction. Meanwhile, the path to pleasure is *frictionless*. Your phone is always within reach. Snacks are in the cabinet. Netflix auto plays the next episode.

**Flip it.** Make pleasure harder to access and discipline easier:

* Want to work out? Sleep in your gym clothes. Put your shoes by the bed.
* Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete Instagram from your phone. Make it annoying to log back in.
* Want to read more? Leave a book on your pillow. Put your phone in another room before bed.

James Clear talks about this in *Atomic Habits*, which yeah, everyone recommends, but honestly it's recommended for a reason. The book is insanely practical. Clear's whole thing is: your environment shapes your behavior more than your motivation ever will. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your space like you're Pavlov training yourself. Best habit formation book, hands down.

## **Step 3: Stack Pleasure AFTER Discipline (The Temptation Bundling Trick)**

Here's where it gets good. You're going to use pleasure as your reward, but *only* after discipline. This is called temptation bundling, and it's backed by research from Katy Milkman at Wharton.

**Here's how it works:**

* Only listen to your favorite podcast while working out
* Only drink your fancy coffee after finishing your morning deep work session
* Only watch that show you love after hitting your daily discipline target

Your brain starts associating discipline with pleasure. Eventually, just *thinking* about the disciplined action triggers dopamine because your brain knows pleasure is coming. You've hacked the reward pathway.

If you want to go deeper but don't have the time or energy to actually read through all these psychology and neuroscience books, there's an app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's an AI-powered personalized learning platform that pulls insights from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers, expert talks, and real behavioral psychology studies, then turns them into custom audio podcasts. 

You can type in something specific like ""I keep breaking my discipline streaks and want to understand the neuroscience behind habit formation,"" and it'll generate a learning plan and podcast episodes tailored exactly to that. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with concrete examples and strategies. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic style that makes even dry psychology papers feel engaging. It also has a virtual coach called Freedia that you can ask follow-up questions mid-episode, which is surprisingly helpful when you want clarification on why your brain keeps sabotaging you. Makes absorbing this kind of knowledge way less of a chore and more of something that actually fits into your commute or gym time.

Try the app **Finch** too. It's a self care pet app, but hear me out. Every time you complete a habit, your little bird grows and unlocks new stuff. Sounds childish? Maybe. But it works because it gives you instant visual dopamine every single time you do something disciplined. Gamification isn't just for kids, it's for anyone trying to rewire their brain.

## **Step 4: Start So Small It Feels Stupid**

You're not going to go from zero discipline to monk mode overnight. That's why you fail every January 1st. You're trying to sprint a marathon.

**The rule: make it so small you can't say no.**

* Don't commit to an hour workout. Commit to putting on gym shoes.
* Don't commit to writing 1000 words. Commit to writing one sentence.
* Don't commit to meditating 20 minutes. Commit to three breaths.

BJ Fogg's *Tiny Habits* is basically the bible for this approach. Fogg ran the behavior design lab at Stanford and spent 20 years figuring out how habits actually form. His method is stupidly simple: make it tiny, make it easy, celebrate immediately. The book will make you realize you've been setting yourself up to fail your entire life by thinking bigger is better. Sometimes smaller is actually the only thing that works.

## **Step 5: Track Everything Like a Psycho**

You can't get addicted to something you can't see. Tracking makes discipline *visible*, which makes it *real*, which makes it *rewarding*.

**Get obsessive:**

* Use a habit tracker app (I like **Habitica** because it turns your life into an RPG game, you gain XP for discipline and lose health for failures)
* Keep a physical journal where you check off every disciplined action
* Take progress photos, track metrics, log your mood

The act of tracking releases dopamine. Seriously. Your brain loves data and completion. Every checkmark is a mini hit.

Cal Newport talks about this in *Deep Work*. He's a computer science professor who basically said ""fuck shallow work"" and built his entire career on intensity and discipline. The book isn't directly about addiction, but it shows you how to become addicted to *focus* instead of distraction. Newport tracks every hour of deep work and treats it like sacred time. Reading it made me realize I'd been confusing ""being busy"" with ""being disciplined"" my whole life.

## **Step 6: Build Your Discipline Identity (Not Just Habits)**

Here's the shift that changes everything: stop saying ""I'm trying to be disciplined"" and start saying ""I am a disciplined person.""

Your brain follows your identity. If you see yourself as someone who struggles with discipline, you'll act accordingly. If you see yourself as someone who *is* disciplined, even when you slip up, you'll get back on track faster.

**How to build this:**

* When you do something disciplined, say out loud: ""This is what disciplined people do""
* When you're tempted by instant pleasure, ask: ""What would the disciplined version of me do right now?""
* Surround yourself with people who are disciplined (or at least online communities like r/GetDisciplined or r/selfimprovement)

David Goggins is the extreme version of this. His book *Can't Hurt Me* is basically discipline porn. The dude ran 100 mile races with broken bones just to prove his mind was stronger than his body. It's intense, maybe too intense for some people, but if you need someone to scream at you through a book that you're capable of way more than you think, Goggins is your guy. Fair warning: this book will either change your life or make you feel like a failure. Depends on how you use it.

## **Step 7: Embrace the Suck (Seriously)**

Discipline will always have friction. It will always be harder than pleasure in the moment. That's the point. You're not trying to make discipline *easy*, you're trying to make it *worth it*.

The more you practice tolerating discomfort, the better you get at it. Your brain adapts. What felt unbearable at week one feels normal at week eight.

**Jocko Willink**, the ex Navy SEAL, has a whole philosophy on this: ""Discipline equals freedom."" His podcast and books hammer this home. When you're disciplined, you're not restricted, you're liberated. You're free from the chaos of your impulses. You're free from regret. The discomfort of discipline is temporary. The discomfort of regret lasts forever.

## **Step 8: Detox from Hyper Stimulation**

If everything in your life is cranked to 11, discipline will always feel boring by comparison. You need to do a **dopamine detox**. I'm talking:

* No social media for a week
* No porn, no junk food, no binge watching
* Just basic activities: work, exercise, reading, real conversations

After a few days, your brain recalibrates. Suddenly, a walk outside feels interesting. A book feels engaging. Discipline doesn't feel like torture anymore because you're not comparing it to a cocaine level dopamine rush.

## **Step 9: Find Your ""Why"" or You'll Quit**

Discipline without purpose is just suffering. You need a reason that's bigger than ""I should do this.""

* Are you building discipline because you want financial freedom?
* Because you're tired of feeling out of control?
* Because you want to prove something to yourself?

Write it down. Look at it every day. When discipline feels hard, remember *why* you're doing it.

Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning* isn't about discipline directly, but it's about finding purpose in suffering, which is basically what discipline is. Frankl survived Nazi concentration camps by finding meaning in his pain. If he can do that, you can survive a 5am workout.

You're not broken. You're not lazy. You're just wired to seek pleasure, and the modern world has weaponized that wiring against you. But once you understand the game, you can play it differently. Discipline becomes addictive when you make it rewarding, visible, and tied to your identity. Start small. Track everything. Stack your pleasures after your discipline. And most importantly: stop waiting to feel motivated. Motivation is a lie. Discipline is the only thing that shows up every single day, even when you don't feel like it.",1,1771209046.0,RelentlessMen,0,1.0,False

I’m 23 now and am still trying to figure myself out. 

There’s a barista at the coffee place I go to and she had commented on how she loved the way the color in my hair was fading and that it “looks better every time” that I came through. I was flattered of course but brushed it off (I go there a lot), didn’t let myself think too much of it

Then the next time I went it was a different girl in the drive thru and when my drink was ready the girl from before passed the girl working the drive thru to give me the drink herself, and even after I had my drink and could’ve just been a “have a nice day” and I drive away moment, she again, complimented my hair, said she wanted to copy my order since it smelled good. Then I had mentioned I just liked the try new things she then went on to tell me new spring drinks were coming, if I liked blue redbull because they’d be getting that and yada yada. 

I had a thought in my head like “this girl is super friendly, is this like flirty?” But I’ve been known to misread so I brushed it off until I asked one of my friends who had also been with a girl before and she saw it as a little flirty. But then my straight friend was seeing it as a no, and just being a good customer service person. 

I’m probably overthinking this and she’s just nice, but it’s like both times I’ve seen her in a row she’s talked to me. And of course she must’ve seen me before since she commented on my hair fading everytime I come through. She’s complimented my hair, my nails, my order. Then the whole giving me the drink herself and talking to me threw me off. So I don’t know. I wanted more opinions from people who are actually experienced in how women flirt , because I know my version of flirting would just be me being nice and hope the other person is psychic 😂. Any opinions on this though? Or how I should go moving forward? I don’t even know if she likes girls

The other day, my gf of about two months asked if I had ever cheated in a past relationship. I said, “No, wait, yes.” I explained that I wasn’t proud of it, but that I had indeed cheated on my previous partner, and that I am 100% willing to give my gf any details she would like about that. I’ve reproduced the story below. My gf thanked me for my honesty, I told her that she was welcome to ask any other questions she had, and everything seemed fine.

It wasn’t fine. The next day my gf called and said that she wasn’t sure she could be in a relationship with a cheater. This hurt, of course, but I said I understood. She clarified that she wasn’t breaking up with me, she just needs to do some thinking. She said that the way I told the story made it seem like I blamed my ex for my decision to cheat. I reiterated what I’d said at the time, I blame myself, and my ex and I had a bad relationship that I have no desire to replicate. My gf wasn’t happy with that response, and she’s said she’d like to take some time to think. I understood that, and I again told her I am willing to elaborate or answer any questions she has.

She also mentioned that because I initially lied to her, she wasn’t sure she could trust me. She’s counting the “no” part of “no, wait, yes” as an initial lie, but I feel like I misspoke and corrected myself immediately. Writing that out, that sounds like something a liar would say, so I would appreciate any takes on this specific issue as well as the overall question.

**The cheating story:**

My past relationship was my first serious adult relationship. I dated a couple guys in high school, nothing physical or serious, realized I was gay, and ignored that for several years before meeting my ex. My ex was less than a year older than me, and had a bit more dating experience. She also had some mental health issues, the severity of which I probably did not appreciate at the time. The effect of this was that, in the 3 years we dated, there were 3 periods of 2 to 3 months each during which she basically ignored me. During these periods, she would stop replying to my texts and stop answering my calls. I was friends with some of her coworkers, so I knew she was still showing up to work, which was the only reason I didn’t get seriously worried for her safety. During these periods, she would text me maybe once every couple of weeks, apologizing, saying we should get together, and then not responding to any attempts I made to plan anything.

The first time this happened, I kind of assumed she was ghosting me. I loved her, and I wanted to be with her, but I reasoned that we hadn’t even been intimate yet and maybe she just didn’t know how to break up with me. We’d dated maybe 3 months, and then she’d done this for almost 3 months, so I kind of figured it was over. I was absolutely thrilled when she texted that we should get dinner the night of a major career milestone of mine. Then I didn’t hear from her again, and I ended up going to dinner alone. I visited a bar after, got way too drunk (like blacked out portions), and went home with a stranger. I’m not sure I’m truly at fault for that night, given how insanely drunk I was. BUT the next night I went back to that same bar and went home with that same stranger, which was absolutely a choice I made.

When my ex started feeling better and contacted me again, I felt horrible about this. I reasoned that I hadn’t ever done that before and wouldn’t ever again, and I had thought she’d ghosted me. Just stupid cheater rationale, I guess. I didn’t tell her about the girl from the bar, and I got tested before we did anything physical.

The second time my ex went through one of these periods, I simply waited it out. I loved her, and I now knew this didn’t mean she was breaking up with me. When she started feeling better, we had a serious talk. I said that I really couldn’t be in a relationship with someone who ignores me for multiple weeks/months. She said she would try to work on that, but also asked that I try not to be so needy.

I really did try— I stopped texting her more than once or twice a week, stopped calling, and made peace with going to events alone. It got pretty embarrassing always showing up at parties like “my gf didn’t want to come,” and somewhere in there I think I kind of checked out of the relationship. When it happened a third time, I was done. But at that point, we’d been together for 3 years, and I felt I owed her an in-person break up. The problem was, she was ignoring me. I tried to arrange a coffee outing or a visit to her place, but she simply wouldn’t respond. During this time, I went out to a club one night, made out with a stranger, and exchanged numbers with her. We texted for about a month before that fizzled out. Ultimately, I was able to get my ex to meet with me, and I broke up with her.

**My gf’s issues with this story:**

I cheated in the only serious relationship I’ve ever been in, the one immediately before this one. I cheated 2 to 3 times (depending on whether you count the first woman as 1 or 2 instances), and I never told my ex. My gf does not like the way I rationalized/excused the cheating at the time or the way I tell the story— she does not think I should include details of why my past relationship was bad, and she believes that this is just me trying to avoid blame. She asked if I consider myself a cheater, and I had to admit that I do not. I think that what I did was awful, and I am absolutely ashamed of it. Given the circumstances, I don’t think it’s fair to say that I am “a cheater” or “a liar” but I certainly cheated and lied in that relationship, so maybe I am.

My gf asked if I would ever do this to her. I said no, I felt awful about it. She asked what would happen if she did what my ex did, and ignored me for several months. I said I would try to talk about it with her, then break up with her if nothing changed, because I’ve learned that isn’t something I can handle in a relationship. She was upset, and said that she shouldn’t have to be in a relationship where she feels like I’ll either cheat on her or break up with her if she goes through a hard time. I said that wasn’t it at all— I would support a partner through a hard time if they would just communicate with me during it. She said it shouldn’t be on her to make sure I don’t cheat, and I completely agree— but I don’t think I’m awful for saying I would end a relationship if my partner ignored me for multiple months.

**Questions:**

I know my actions were bad. How bad? Am I really a liar and a cheater? Can my current gf, and any future gfs I may have, really never trust me because of what I did? How can I make it clear that I do not think cheating is right, and I do not ever want to cheat again? Is there a different way I should frame this story (like, I cheated, it was inexcusable, with no mention of the situation?) either in my own mind and/or when telling it? Should I mention this to prospective partners, rather than waiting to be asked?

Thank you for any advice you might give. I know what I did was wrong. I just don’t know how to move forward with my life and relationships.",1,1771208795.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

If you have ever heard some old, faithful pastor deliver his final sermon, his farewell sermon—and I have heard a few over the years—it is usually encouraging and uplifting and challenging words that are long remembered and cherished. 

Well, you had better buckle up, because Jesus is about to deliver His final public sermon, and it is going to be long remembered by those who hear it. It is a powerful message of warning and judgment.

Jesus is in the temple court, where He has handled all the tricky, devious questions and challenges from Pharisees, scribes, Herodians, and Sadducees. Now in Matthew 23 He concludes His time of teaching in the temple with a message that begins this way: 

*“The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat,so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice.”* (verses 2-3)

They are sitting in the seat of Moses—teaching the law of Moses, that is. The commands they teach ought to be observed. But these teachers are not themselves personally living by them.

I remember listening to a man preach on the radio, a best-selling author who traveled the world holding audiences spellbound. It was only after he died that it was proved he had mistresses in several different countries where he traveled. He was not practicing what he was preaching. Years ago, my wife and I were in Vienna, Austria, touring a beautiful mansion and grounds a Catholic Bishop had built centuries earlier. The guide said that this bishop lived there with his mistress and their children.

These men Jesus is describing hold positions of honor in their religious communities. They are preaching, but they are not practicing.

Jesus describes how these religious hypocrites love to put on their followers the burden of traditions and rules that they will not bear themselves (verse 4). All they want is attention for themselves (verse 5). They want the places of honor in public (verse 6). And they love to be addressed with special titles (verse 7). 

They loved titles. I remember years ago receiving an honorary doctorate. It was a very kind gesture, but it made my head swell up. I finally took the diploma down and put it in the closet and removed the title Dr. from any books or literature that we published since that time. I agree with an old preacher who once said an honorary doctorate is like putting whipped cream on an onion. Well, I am an onion. And whipped cream did not help me one bit.

Jesus says in verse 9, “And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father who is in heaven.” Jesus is not referring to your biological father but to any spiritual leader. Do not call him father. Frankly we are all ordinary clay pots into whom the glorious gospel has been poured (2 Corinthians 4:7).

Now along that same line, Jesus has a reminder for them in verses 11-12: 

*“The greatest among you shall be your servant.Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”*

The scribes and Pharisees who are standing there are probably seething with anger as Jesus effectively warns the people about them. But they have not heard anything yet! Jesus now begins to address them directly with a series of woes. A woe is essentially a pronouncement of judgment. It is not vindictive or spiteful, but it is a severe warning.

There are seven woes in this chapter, and each one gives a reason for it. And keep in mind that Jesus is describing the scribes and Pharisees as a whole. Some are, in fact, sincere and actually seeking the truth about Jesus. And some are going to come to faith later on.

Jesus begins in verse 13: 

*“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.”* 

In other words, “Your rejection of Christ is bad enough, but you are leading others to reject the Lord as well.” 

The second woe, in verse 15, is related to their pursuit of making new converts. Jesus says that their converts actually become children of hell—they are more lost than ever.

In the third woe, in verse 16, Jesus calls the scribes and Pharisees “blind guides” who make all kinds of pious-sounding vows or oaths; but they do not mean any of it. They find convenient ways to break their promises whenever they want to. 

Woe number four is in verse 23. Jesus says, “You tithe mint and dill . . . and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness.” Here they are, almost comically, counting out little tiny dill seeds so they can tithe one out of ten. Yet they ignore far more important matters of integrity and justice. As Jesus puts it in verse 24, they try to avoid swallowing a little gnat, but then they will swallow a camel! That is, they focus on minor things and minimize major things.

Both the fifth woe in verse 25 and the sixth one in verse 27 emphasize hypocrisy again. Jesus says they are like a cup that appears clean on the outside but is filthy inside. Nobody does that. I drink coffee just about every morning. If that bothers you, I hope you will get over it soon. Now I would never leave coffee in my cup from yesterday and just clean and wipe off the outside. A clean cup is clean outside and inside. 

Jesus goes on to say that these religious leaders are like whitewashed tombs, with clean headstones hiding the death that’s on the inside. He says in verse 28, “You also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.” 

The seventh and final woe highlights this same kind of hypocrisy. These religious leaders built beautiful tombs for prophets whom their ancestors had martyred. Jesus says to them that they share the same killer instinct of their forefathers—even now they are plotting to kill Jesus. 

Jesus then hammers down the verdict in verse 33: “You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?” Beloved, I cannot imagine stronger words from Jesus. 

This stirring, convicting message is followed by two incidents. First, in verse 37 Jesus laments over Jerusalem—He weeps over the nation Israel. He grieves that judgment is coming.[\[1\]](applewebdata://85B25259-9FBC-4BEA-B124-F03CC67AAFD0#_ftn1)

He concludes by saying in verse 39, “You will not see me again, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’” Now that is a little a ray of hope for Israel. God has not abandoned them entirely. The Bible tells us that one day the nation will welcome Jesus back when He returns at His second coming to establish His millennial kingdom!

Then there is one more brief scene recorded in both Mark and Luke’s Gospels while Jesus is still in the temple court. He has evidently taken a seat, and He is watching as people are putting money into the temple offering boxes. Mark 12:42 records, “A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins.” This amounted to less than a cent. Note what Jesus says to His disciples here in verses 43-44:

*“This poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had.”*

Here is a woman who stands in vivid contrast to those hypocrites. She is not putting on a show for others. She has no idea the Lord of the universe is watching her. There is no hypocrisy, just simple, honest, sacrificial worship of her Lord.

Beloved, let’s be more like her and less like these religious leaders as we seek to exalt the name of Christ in our world today.

My blood pressure was crazy high but came down after some time. They did a stool test and it was positive for blood. My hemoglobin and everything was fine, and I wasn’t pale or vomiting more so they sent me home. I guess it’s a “light” bleed.

However, my family never had it; no one I've ever known has mentioned having it;  I've never noticed in the stores in my area in western Canada. I get the sense that it's a beverage popular with older people. Am I wrong? Who are the primary consumers of Ovaltine?  I must admit the name sounds like some old-timey medicinal balm that grandma would put on her bunions.

From skimming Wikipedia, I gather that it was originally made in Switzerland, by a British company, but it now manufactured in several countries including in North America.

Google AI says, ""Ovaltine is a popular, fortified malt drink mix used to create hot or cold chocolate-malt beverages by mixing with milk.

I did magic mushrooms and post that experience cannabis intake put me into psychosis and i had a couple bad episodes. 

2 years later I was off meds and completely fine. I stopped taking any substances as well. I started working and did well at work. I been single the whole time.

Now 2 months ago. I got infatuated with a female co worker. I was not able to ask her out for coffee for about a month due to my social anxiety. My mind started racing for hope, interest in her, do gym (because liked buffed men), jammed on music (didn’t listen much before this phase), think about her, plan what I should talk, brain felt very happy, and this circle repeats. This went on for about 1.5 month until she hinted she got a boyfriend. Suddenly my emotions lowered down, circle started draining and my mind felt lighter. ( i never realized my mind was heavy when i was in that phase)

I am looking for help on how I can avoid this in future? How can I identify I am in this loop (while I am in there) not when the situation gets closed by the other person. ",1,1771208401.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

1r5x7ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1r5x7ig/12_days_levofloxacin_3_month_update_recovery/,12 Days Levofloxacin - 3 Month Update & Recovery,"Hey Everyone. With this update I figured it appropriate to use the Recovery flair as things have improved significantly since my last update. As usual, I'll try and divide things into a short update and a longer update.

# Short Update

At 3 months out I can distinctly say that I no longer feel any heaviness in my legs. Additionally, the muscle twitching I have been feeling has significantly reduced. My calves still twitch after a lot of movement, but the random twitching in the rest of my body is happening way less frequently. Mental stress can cause them to come back a bit, but not nearly to the amount or intensity they did 1 or 2 months back.

I had an EMG as well as several blood tests that ruled out all of the big nasties I was so anxious about: ALS, MG, MS, etc. After that confirmation my anxiety faded and with it, I saw an acceleration in my recovery. Really makes me think that the brunt of my floxing was CNS related considering just how much the physical symptoms come and go with mental stress.

Sadly my prostatitis symptoms continue, but now that I am recovering so well I am feeling ready to go back to my urologist and consider an alternative like Bactrim. I've handled it fine before so I am trying to stay optimistic I'll be fine on a number of weeks of it. Again, bacterial infection was confirmed for me with Morganella Morganii being the culprit.

Feeling 90-98% for the past two weeks consistantly

# Long Update

Things have improved significantly since my 2 month update. The first two weeks were the same old roller coaster of mild heaviness in my legs and muscle twitching all over. During this time I had a ton of anxiety over the possibility of my floxing triggering or leading to something worse. I had a ton of irrational fear over ALS, MS, MG, or some other big bad. This anxiety never truly allowed me to fully calm myself and no doubt attributed to the CNS symptoms I've gotten from all this.

I went in for my yearly physical and spoke to my doctor about my ongoing symptoms. In short he ordered a ton of blood work and an EMG. Blood work showed no issues and came back entirely normal. Magnesium, potassium, and calcium were all good. B12 levels were also good and my Vitamin D was only borderline deficient. Additional tests also ruled out Myasthenia Gravis.

I went in for my EMG where they tested both legs and found everything was normal. The neurologist had me perform a bunch of movements and did his best to scrutinize in an attempt to find \*SOMETHING\* but ultimately found nothing wrong. My largest fear was ALS and he assured me that I wouldn't have to worry about that, which was and still is exceedingly reassuring. I did ask him if he's heard of anyone else coming in with leg weakness or muscle twitching caused by antibiotics, to which he said he hadn't. At the end, he seemed completely stumped but also unconcerned about my condition being degenerative.

After all this reassurance, and a combination of going to therapy, a lot of my anxiety significantly died down. Shortly thereafter, any remaining weakness in my legs quickly subsided and the muscle twitching in my legs and rest of my body notably reduced. As the days have gone on, this trend has continued to the point where some days I genuinely feel 95-98%. On my best days this past week I've had may one or two fleeting instances of muscles twitching and absolutely zero weakness. My worst days my right Achilles may ache ever so slightly and my calves may twitch a bunch for 5-10 minutes after a walk. Also I may get other random muscle twitching here and there a few times on a bad day, but nothing has been burdensome.

I have noticed that my muscle twitching can flare up on days where my stress levels are high. Additionally caffeine absolutely seems to have a strong effect on my muscle twitching. A green tea is okay, but a strong cup of coffee or ESPECIALLY a small red bull flares everything up a ton. Really drives home for me that my floxing seems to be more CNS related, as I can literally feel the physical symptoms come back the more stressed out I am, fairly consistently. Again though, the intensity and frequency continues to reduce as time goes on.

Interestingly enough, alcohol doesn't seem to flare me up at all. Over the past month I have on a few occasions had alcohol ranging from a single drink to getting alittle drunk. No flares  whatsoever during or the morning after drinking. I may even say that drinking to have a small relaxing buzz has actually helped a tad.

As for what got me into this mess in the first place, my prostatitis symptoms continue to persist and lately seem to have gotten more frequent. I've put off going back to my urologist while I deal with my floxing as to not completely overwhelm myself. Now that I've been feeling distinctly better these past couple of weeks, I am feeling ready to try again. When I first voiced my concerns about FQs, my urologist did offer Bactrim alongside Augmentin for 3 weeks as an alternative. Seems pretty clear to me like that is my next step now that we've confirmed that I cannot tolerate FQs. Just hoping he doesn't try and suggest cipro or something x.x

That said, I may hold off on going on Bactrim until I return from a Japan trip mid April. My prostatitis symptoms, despite being confirmed bacterial have a tendency to remain pretty mild and come and go. >!At worse I may feel a little bit of a sharp pain when I climax but it's never been intensely painful. Also I can urinate with no pain 9 times out of 10, with that 10th time only being a very very mild discomfort.!<Since Bactrim requires you to stay out of the sun, I would hate to be on it when for two weeks most of my time will be spent walking around outside in the sun lol. We'll see how it goes. If my prostatitis symptoms worsen enough I'll start now and try to handle taking it during japan. I've taken 12 days of it before with no issues so if I have to end up taking it, I'll hopefully be alright and just put on a ton of sunscreen.

In conclusion, this past month has been so much better for me with the largest reduction of symptoms I've felt since this began. It's nice to feel like I am 90-98% consistently now for the past two weeks rather than a constant back and forth of good days and flare ups. Here is to hoping things continue to improve. And of course, I wish the best for you all as well and hope you see similar or even better recovery here soon. Levofloxacin in particular seemed scary, as it seemed like the one that tended to cause the worst and/or longest lasting symptoms. I don't wish to jinx myself by saying this of course, but I hope that my story can help those floxed by levo find some hope.

My updates from here on out may get shorter or less frequent and I likely wont be watching this sub as much. Naturally this comes from a place of wanting to move on. That said if anyone has questions for me I welcome your DMs. I'll be sure to give my 6th month update, at the very least.

Best of luck to you all, and take care.",3,1771208252.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

My coworkers at my old shop in our group text, and then R called me on the phone just screwing around he sang me a song which was hilarious. And asked me how this shop was and I told him about how E is an asshole. R is getting promoted to manager D will still be the boss. But R is in charge of day to day I guess? I don't know how it works really, but good for him he deserves it.  My grandma texted me, asking how I was and when I think I'll be back to the old shop.  

I texted S that I was sorry(for asking her to the concert) and I won't bother her anymore.  Then she texted me that she wasn't bothered by it, and she told me to chill and a laughing emoji(I don't get why that's funny).  Anyway she had some house trouble yesterday.  She said she'll go to the concert with me, but I should still look for someone. I'm conflicted about the whole thing. I want to still be friends, but I was already accepting that it was over.  She doesn't talk to me like she used to, but I'd be sad if she stopped completely.


I finally got out of bed at 3pm.  I feel just as depressed as yesterday. For ""breakfast"" I had some plain oatmeal with strawberries.  For lunch I finished my brother's small pizza(he doesn't eat leftovers for whatever reason). I have been drinking coffee nonstop I'm on cup 13 as of writing.

I was going to pick up my prescriptions and get some stuff for s'mores (craving dark chocolate s'mores for some reason I haven't had those since I was 8).  But I can't make myself leave the house today. 

Lexapro seems like it helps me function during the week until I spiral for the weekend. I'm cold today the heat is set to 68, and I'm still freezing.

1r5x6uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1r5x6uk/finally_achieved_that_90s_alt_reverie_escapist/,"Finally achieved that '90s alt reverie escapist vibe I've been dreaming of: My messy journey to a diffused, dreamy eye look (used a single cream shadow stick + finger blending!) 🌙","For ages, I’ve admired the deep, moody romance of *literary gothic* aesthetics, but always wondered how to translate those dramatic vibes into something wearable for, you know, grabbing coffee or just existing. My latest experiment was taking a step back from full-on vamp and finding the everyday poetry in it, leaning into a *functionalist* approach to a look that still whispers ""I've probably got a copy of *Wuthering Heights* in my bag.""

The challenge was to get that dark, smudged eye and deep lip without looking like I was headed to a costume party in broad daylight. It definitely involved a few surprising turns, and not every attempt was a masterpiece (my first try involved way too much black eyeshadow and I ended up looking more like a confused raccoon than a brooding romantic).

Here’s what eventually clicked for a soft, *literary gothic* vibe that feels authentic and wearable:

*   **Aesthetic Inspiration:** *Literary Gothic* meets a touch of *'90s alt* grunge for the smudged effect. The goal was more ""moody antique photograph"" than ""horror movie villain.""
*   **Key Products & Price Points:**
    *   **Eyeshadow:** e.l.f. Bite-Size Eyeshadow in **Berry Bad** (around $3). This tiny palette has a matte deep plum and a shimmery berry that are perfect for soft depth.
    *   **Eyeliner:** NYX Epic Smoke Liner in **Black Smoke** (around $10). It's a pencil with a brush on the other end, making smudging a breeze. Crucial for that *chaotic curator* touch of purposeful messiness.
    *   **Mascara:** essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara in **Black** (around $5). Just good, solid black mascara for definition without clumps.
    *   **Lipstick/Tint:** Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in **Black Cherry** (around $9), applied as a stain.
    *   **Lip Balm:** Burt's Bees Tinted Lip Balm in **Red Dahlia** (around $5), for a sheer, comfortable finish.
*   **Application Techniques (My Process):**
    1.  **Eyes:** I started by applying the matte deep plum shade from the e.l.f. palette all over the lid, but *only* up to the crease, keeping it quite sheer.
    2.  Then, I took the NYX Epic Smoke Liner and applied it along my upper lash line, focusing on getting it right into the roots. Before it set, I used the brush end to gently smudge it outwards and upwards, creating a soft, smoky wing that wasn't too sharp. This is where the *'90s alt* vibe really came in – a bit undone.
    3.  A tiny bit of the same liner on the outer lower lash line, just barely smudged.
    4.  Two coats of essence mascara, focusing on lengthening rather than volume.
    5.  **Lips:** This was the biggest game-changer. Instead of applying the Revlon Black Cherry directly from the bullet, I dabbed it onto my finger, then pressed and blotted it onto my lips, creating a sheer, stained effect.
    6.  After blotting with a tissue, I topped it with the Burt's Bees Red Dahlia balm for comfort and a touch more sheen. This gave the deep color a *reverie escapist* softness, making it less intense and more ethereal.
*   **Time Invested:** About 15-20 minutes total. Quick enough for a morning routine, but impactful enough to feel intentional.

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**
My first attempt at this look was far too heavy on the black eyeliner, making my eyes look smaller and giving me less of the romantic poet vibe and more of a ""stay away from me"" vibe. Another time, I went too sheer on the lips, and it just looked like I’d been eating berries haphazardly. The key was finding that balance – enough depth to feel *literary gothic*, but enough sheerness and softness to be *functionalist* for daytime.

I was genuinely surprised by how much difference applying the lipstick with a finger made; it diffused the color beautifully and made a traditionally bold shade feel much more approachable. It’s definitely not a ""flawless"" or ""perfect"" look, but it feels authentic and like *me*. It's a reminder that experimentation is rarely a straight line, but the discoveries along the way are often the most rewarding.
