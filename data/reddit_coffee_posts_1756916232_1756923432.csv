1n7meh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1n7meh9/lopesan_costa_bavaro_review/,Lopesan Costa Bavaro Review,"I rarely get involved in a subredit based on time and ROI but felt compelled to share my experience based on a lot of value I received from this sub when planning a family vacation. I'll try to be both concise and comprehensive but if anyone has any questions I'll try to answer.

**Who and Where**

I took my family of 5 to Lopesan in June at the end of May 2025. We stayed June 3rd -10th in a Unique resort (more on that in a bit) with an 8,14, and 16 year old split between two rooms. The trip all in was in the mid teens in USD. We stayed with family (another 6 people, 2 adults, 4 kids) for a large family vacation.

**Summary**

I think the experience was good and despite not being my style of vacation I felt like there was a solid the staff. That said, even after adjusting my expectations I personally found aspects of the trip uneven which may be part and parcel of all inclusive. Ultimately, I'd research these types of vacations more thoroughly to determine if I need to spend more to achieve desired results or just really avoid these types of trips which obviously gives me more control but also much more to plan.

**Hotel Room and Grounds**

Our hotel room was in the Unique space and had a swim up pool attached and was very close to the beach. The swim up space was fantastic for a moderate amount of convenient privacy though there are an abundance of pools, some of which are closer than others. The room was fine with open space connecting bathroom and bed. There's a good bit of humidity (tropical climate) so there were days where there was a dampness to everything but it was too distracting. The Hotel and all grounds were very clean and one of the highlights because it was appealing just to walk the expansive property.

**Food**

This was a very uneven experience due to a few factors. First, one very important personal opinion is that having access to the Unique grill was the highlight of eating in terms of consistency and quality. The Unique Grill is a component of the Unique Bar, both private amenities. The bar is just an additional bar serving the exact same menu as others. The grill though essentially offered a variety of standard meats and cuts which were cut for price (e.g. a 3 oz filet mignon) but generally of good quality and all you can eat like the standard buffet. It was to me the same quality as an American country club grill offering fish, burgers, pork, etc and we ate there for every lunch. It was never backed up, the grill master was very kind, and service was moderately quick. The buffet option we used for breakfast was adequate to disappointing but my research indicated it to be standard for pricepoint. 

For dinner there were sit down fixed menu restaraunts that were all over the place in terms of quality. Oddly the mexican place was pretty mediocre but the Italian place was ok. Think within the range of quality that a low end to mid-tier US sit down chain would offer (Chili's, TGIFRidays). The multiple courses and variety helped but the overall quality was just poor imo and while I'm no foodie I live in a major US city and am generally willing to put in effort for a better experience. Also, the Greek restaurants has a lobster dinner that's included for Unique visitors. I did not like it all but some family found it OK.

**Drinks**

I heard reports of poor drinks and while the variety is very limited (very standard fare across the board) the options and quality were all fine. I had a few cocktails a day and found them fine. Fruit drinks that relied heavily on syrup were way too sweet to me but I never order them typically so don't know if they were poorly made.

**Beach and Pools**

I live int he southeastern United States about 7 hours from the blue-ish beach of the Florida gulf and 4 hours from the beaches of South Carolina. I've traveled to both off and on for thirty years. I found the Costa Bavaro beach disappointing in that the water was not particularly clear ( I had unreasonable expectations here) but also there were quite a few boats and also no waves. We went most data because there was ample seating (Unique has a designated section but all spaces were very open) and it was still lovely weather. I frankly just prefer at the stage a quiet beach with waves which SC provides even over Florida. My children also shared this sentiment based on a lifetime to reasonably close beach access. There are also peddlers trying to sell stuff but no one was rude or intrusive in my view.

**Service**

Unique guests have a ""butler"" effectively someone to help plan and accomodate basic issues if you are inclined. They were helpful in booking restaurants and there were a couple of very kind efforts (I asked for local snacks and many were provided to my room free of charge) but was also essentially checked in the morning and evening and did not text him for anything most of the stay. Very few people speak any english and my highschool level Spanish was very appreciated even if totally inadequate. All the staff was very kind and tried to be conversational despite my limitations.

**Surrounding shopping and experiences**

Lopesan prides itself on having shops, a theatre, ice cream shops, etc. and this was initially a draw to me to give my busy children some options if they wanted. That said, it was mostly a disappointment as the shops, bars, etc. were just soulless. The shops effectively sold bad tourist junk and the additional eating/drinking locations had no unique offerings. They were clean and decent hangouts though for my kids and my family when we wanted to stay out a bit later. The coffee shop was great but did not have large cups. I felt like ordering three coffees every morning but decided not to be a jerk. 

We took one excursion snorkeling which was an hour outside the resort with a chartered boat. It was my first time snorkeling and a fun time though the water was not so clear it was easy to spot everything. We did go to a sand bar where the water (2-3 feet deep) was absolutely beautiful and stayed 30 minutes to an hour. I think the afternoon costs 800 USD. The staff were super nice it included snacks and beer but also was clearly tailored for a larger and more raucous group (imo) as the staff felt compelled to play loud music and dance with our boring and more reserved group. The younger kids in the group had fun dancing and I feel like the guide was the experience as good as possible. I can look up service if someone is interested.

**Final Conclusion**

I understand all inclusive vacations and Lopesan was very chill during our stay. The bartender I befriended explained that the hotel is absolutely packed during different times of the year and our stay was the calm before the storm. Ultimately I don't think Lopesan did anything particularly wrong it was just a mix of still ungrounded expectations of the beach and my personal disinterest in all-you-can-eat style vacations. Hypothetically if I would have had to trade the quality surroundings, kind staff, or even the paid for upgrades for better all around food or beach I would likely not as those were things that were less critical imo. That said, not sure when or if I will do an all-inclusive again.

They can take as long as you need to prepare but they must finish before him. 

If they die, they lose

There are three courses: 

1. 75 extremely large country fried steaks covered in barbecue sauce with massive servings of corn on the cob and gravy with mashed potatoes. Served with 75 ft pints of Green dragon beer and topped off with a cake made out of lembas bread with a cherry that can sate even the hungriest person with one bite.

2: a truly gigantic serving of flapjacks followed by 38 cups of coffee served in Mile high pints followed by pie a mile long and a Twinkie encrusted cake made from heavenly cream and fluffy butter. The final portion is a 19 mile long pig roasted over 75 years, with meat that practically falls off the bone, seasoned with both spices that do not exist on Earth and seasonings that only heaven can come up with.

3: a seven-layer custard consisting of cream, pancakes, candy so delicious that it can induce diabetic comas in mere mortals, candied rum, pretzels the size of minivans and jam from heaven itself. Served with 3 pints of whiskey, a barrel of cream soda, two gigantic plates of pork sausage followed by German sausage, sauerkraut and a truly ludicrous amount of beef jerky.

Bonus: obelisk vs superman prime 

 the character must be capable of eating large amounts of calories in a short sitting. If they are meta human or a regular human (no aliens) then they fit. Characters like matter eater lad and do not fit the qualification as they are of an alien race that have an unfair advantage. 

Anime protagonists count as long as they are of human origin. If they hail from another planet, they can't do it.

Any Advice?,"I was introduced to Joe Dispenza about 5 months ago, and at that time my life felt like it was moving at a blissful, almost rhythmic pace. I started by listening to his interviews and podcasts, which opened me up to the idea of the quantum field. About 4 months ago, I bought Becoming Supernatural, and about a month and a half ago I purchased the Progressive Online Course. I’m now about 3/4 of the way through both.

I have been doing the 'Tuning In With Your Heart' meditation daily and adding in 'The Generous Present Moment' whenever I have more time. I have prioritized the heart-centered meditation because I want to cultivate and radiate emotions of love, gratitude, joy, compassion, worthiness, trust, confidence, excitement and infinite.

I have now been really struggling with a breakup that occurred about a month ago. Before that, it was much easier to be present both in everyday life and during meditations. Since then, my mind tends to wander a lot more often back to thoughts of her, sometimes just drifting off entirely. In the early weeks after the breakup, my meditations often revolved around her and imagining her return, subconsciously creating expectations which took me out of the present moment. Through these thoughts and ideations that I was creating I was trying to cultivate and imagine the feelings in which I would feel when the relationship returns. Also idealizing changes in both myself and her, I am trying to get away from this through trust and 'let them'.

Lately, I have found myself fighting drowsiness while meditating. I typically will wake up around 5AM leave my bedroom lights off sit cross-legged on the ground with a blanket over my legs. However, I have found my foot often falls asleep and/or I catch my posture and shoulders sagging/drooping which I believe adds to the sleepiness. I’m considering trying a yoga block or a firmer seat to help keep me more alert. Or trying to get creative in ways that I can improve my posture while mediating and entering the quantum field. Do you think posture plays a big role in staying engaged? Do you all have any tips or tricks for avoiding dozing off while still going deep into meditation? Maybe, grabbing a coffee or water before entering the mediation, going for a walk? I know that melatonin levels are higher during the early waking hours so we are more suggestable and easier to walk in the subconscious mind and reprogram ourselves. What is the best practice here? Should I be prioritizing night time mediations instead? Or maybe 'Tuning into New Potentials at night'? Any ideas/suggestions?

Another question: I listen to Dr. Joe's guided mediations with AirPods, do you think the Bluetooth frequency interferes with the energy field in any way?

I feel as if I am on the verge of breaking through with these meditations. In the beginning, I had strong feelings of love, some visions, and what felt like powerful activation. Now I’m just having trouble staying grounded and present.

Any advice, whether it’s on posture, specific meditations to try, or techniques for holding focus without slipping into sleep would be greatly appreciated.

I think deep down I’ve always had discomfort with being a girl or woman. I’ve always hated my feminine name and vowed that if I ever had kids, either their first or middle name would be solidly gender neutral. 

For a while as a child, I exclusively wore boys clothes and had a huge disdain for anything feminine. I hated developing breasts and I cried when I got my first period. Getting my period coincided with wearing my hair down, wearing more feminine clothing, and just the general middle school attempt at trying to got fit in.

I had short hair from 13-15 and loved it, while still wearing slightly more feminine clothes, but grew it out again in my second attempt to fit in. 

I buzzed my hair twice and grew it out again, while vehemently asserting I was straight and cis. Eventually I came to terms with being bi, and then lesbian. Then she/they nonbinary…

I cut my hair into a longer “boys” haircut and have started binding my chest, and all of a sudden I have this feeling of unease. Each time I move to more masculine presentation, I feel like I’m going to regret it but then I end up feeling more at home and wanting to go further masc.

I’m constantly scared that at some point I’m going to cross the point of no return, but I already know I can’t go back. 

I guess it’s been a slow progression but it feels like it happened so fast because all of a sudden I’m feeling those jolts of dysphoria. And small flickers of euphoria when I order coffee under a masc name. 

I just don’t have anywhere to put my feelings right now and am uncomfortable sharing it with anyone in my life. If anyone has stories of their own realizations I’d really like to hear them so I feel a bit less  alone.

There's been this cloud hanging over the Spam Wars discussion these past few years in the back of everyone's minds that's been hinted at, and is now being full blown discussed by the knots-ocean-antispam camp.

I'm not even sure I'm going to speak of it here directly.

With that said, I'm not sure they are wrong to bring up these darker points now on the social attack vector they are concerned about.

I'm not really sure what I'm struggling with here, what question I have, or what I want yet, so I'm writing to find this point.

I like running a Bitcoin Core node. Always have, I started Bitcoin by running one and using the GUI wallet within, since I figured it was the most secure setup to have as a hot wallet, and it was at the time.

I played with OP_returns back in the day, since i thought it would be fun to embed permanent messages into the chain. soon after doing this I was told about the other side of this coin, and so stopped.

permanent data storage, and forced at that (if you want to use Bitcoin with full verification) is a double edged sword.

on one hand, it's why we have bitcoin, on the other hand, it's going to probably enable some evil.

hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.

bitcoin nodes are speaking, hearing and seeing shadows of these evils that can be rendered into their darker forms with third party tools.

This isn't just a complication of legal responsibility, but moral culpability, which I personally feel I have in this matter. 

I'd rather my node not speak, hear or see these things in as much as is possible within consensus. Yes I'd still like to participate in as much verification as possible of Bitcoin's consensus while avoiding these shadows. 

And I'd rather developers not hinder my ability to do so in use of the tools we've had for a long time to choose how to run our own Bitcoin Core nodes (the current reference implementation). Defaults could help here too, but I'm not sticky on that file. I'd happily trade away all the defaults, so long as users can configure their nodes with the reference implementation to precisely choose what and what is not spoken, seen, and heard by their nodes. 

I am disturbed by the level of careless nonchalance, ignorance, misinformation, gas lightning, bike shedding, and general bad faith of the discourse on this issue. And unfortunately, both camps are guilty of this. And it appears that both camps have long standing personal beefs that extend beyond this arbitrary data issue, and are using this as a proxy to hurt each other personally.

so what is a lowly bitcoin user to do when the giants fight. quite frankly, I'm getting out the way. 

I probably won't be running a node on a windows machine in the future.

I probably won't be doing so on clearnet, only tor and i2p.

I'd be interested in weird prunes of my block data base and utxoset to limit illicit data blobs on disk and in ram, but those are currently not available and probably undermine verification ethos.

Depending how heated this gets, I may not longer run a node altogether. Even if it's knots.

I don't like how personnel beefs are getting amplified and exercised in this debate. people, good people, on both sides, are going to get hurt in ways they don't deserve.

Worse still, some scum of the earth people seem to be dancing around this fire, adding gasoline. a lot of them pretend to be bitcoiners, and wear orange ties, and they'll probably get away scotch free. such is life.

I've really tried to act in good faith with my Bitcoin journey, it's been a long one. I probably have failed a lot in multiple regards. no one's perfect.

I hope this helps. I don't know anymore.

💡 Tech Trivia: The Webcam That Wasn’t Meant for Zoom Calls

When most people think of webcams, they imagine virtual meetings, online classes, or streaming setups—cornerstones of modern remote life. But few know that the first webcam wasn’t designed for human faces at all. It was invented to monitor a coffee pot.

That’s right—a coffee pot.

Back in 1991, a team of computer scientists at the University of Cambridge grew weary of walking to the Trojan Room in their computer lab only to find the communal coffee pot empty. Dr. Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Paul Jardetzky created a simple camera setup, streamed over their local computer network to show the pot’s status in real-time. It used a video capture card connected to an Acorn Archimedes computer and transmitted grayscale images at 129x129 pixels. This rudimentary system saved countless wasted trips—and in the process, became the world’s first webcam.

By 1993, as web browsers gained image-display capabilities, the camera feed was connected to the internet—marking a quiet but revolutionary shift. What was a tongue-in-cheek solution for caffeine addiction ended up laying the foundation for web-based video communication.

What most people don’t realize: the original webcam’s design didn’t include audio or high resolution. That limitation forced early developers to optimize video compression, ultimately influencing streaming protocols used decades later—including tech used by Zoom and YouTube.

Whether you see them as internet milestones or forgotten novelties, these hidden origin stories are full of engineering foresight and accidental genius.

So here's a thought—what modern gadget do you think was born from something totally unexpected? Which gadget’s backstory should I unpack next?

The good thing is I’ve been keeping a close budget and I already have solid credit, which makes things smoother. Still, I don’t want to slip into debt before my first year is over. A couple people mentioned debit cards that build credit, so you only spend what you actually have, which feels more my speed while I’m learning to manage everything.

Has anyone here tried one of those? Did it really help your score? Any hidden fees or restrictions I should know? Also, local tips would be huge: best way to save on groceries (Trader Joe’s vs. ACME vs. Fresh Grocer), internet setups that don’t suck around University City, utilities hacks once it gets colder, or even textbook-buying systems that actually save money.

I’m already using my SEPTA key card to cut down on Uber costs, cooking at home to avoid overspending in University City, and setting a weekly “fun money” cap so I don’t burn through cash too fast. Would love to hear what’s worked for other students here.

I met my best friend in OT school and eventually my wife, while working my first OT job. The profession has changed and shaped my life for the better. But there is so much more Occupational Therapy can offer…to our clients, to our fellow healthcare colleagues, to the healthcare system and society as a whole. 

I’d like to encourage all OTs to take a role in advocating for our profession in order to push our discipline forward. This requires all of us to step outside of our comfort zone, think outside the box and most importantly GET LOUD and communicate our needs and wants. 

I know advocacy can be difficult. Many OTs are isolated in their work and don’t have genuine opportunities to connect with other OTs. We need to be able to engage in meaningful discussions, vent our frustrations, share experiences and push for change. 

OTs have also been historically taken advantage of, whether it be lower compensation than other health professions with equivalent education, having limitations placed on our scope of practice, having our recommendations undermined, etc. 

So what does advocacy actually look like? 

1. We need to create spaces and opportunities for OTs who work in similar areas, to connect safely, and share knowledge and experiences. The system gaslights us into thinking “is it just me”? When really, we all have very similar experiences. I’ve realized this the more I reach out to other OTs. 

2. In my opinion, we have to do a better job educating and collaborating with other healthcare professionals to improve their understanding of OT and how we can make their lives easier while also improving client outcomes. I’ve had success simply grabbing a coffee with PTs, SWs Psychologists, Physicians, personal injury lawyers, advocates and talking to them about recent successes with clients. Mind you, I’ve also been turned down for these meetings on many occasions. But that’s ok. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. 

3. Approach leadership/ decision makers/ gatekeepers/ policy makers to discuss the benefits of OT. I recently cold emailed a CEO of a referral source I’ve worked with for several years (purely out of frustration with the work/ pay/ disrespect from their employees) and the CEO actually responded and offered me a meeting with the appropriate director. I was told by another OT who worked for this same referral source years back, that the CEO would never take a meeting with me and the same with any of the directors. 

4. Communicate the challenges/ issues with your provincial or national  association and see if there is a committee working on these issues. Perhaps a new committee can be created. We don’t need to wait until OT month in October to speak up and organize. 

Thank you for being an OT. We do such meaningful work. Thank you also for listening to my rant.

Assume I \[31F\] have a younger sister \[29F\] who's been married to her husband \[34M\] for a couple of 5 years. Over time, I've noticed she's ceased meeting with friends  doesn't go to family get-togethers as often, and when she does go, is constantly checking her phone or making comments like ""he doesn't want me to be gone for so long"" or ""I need to call him real quick."".

Every time I ask her out for coffee or even just to chat  she usually says she has to ask him permission first or that she is too exhausted because he made her do something. It's as if she has to ask permission for everything.

So in theory, I told her that I felt her husband was controlling  not necessarily threateningly, but controlling in the way that he keeps her apart from all the other human beings. I told her that I missed hanging out with her and that she doesn't seem to be as free or as happy anymore. I didn't yell and I didn't call anyone names  I just tried to be honest.

She got angry and said I was judging her wedding  and that you wouldn't understand because you're not married. We ended on kind awkward terms  and now I'm wondering.

In this fictitious situation  AITAH for mentioning it and maybe making her feel attacked?

I'm looking for people to test a tool that creates a voice “survey” from a simple prompt.

Instead of scheduling calls, you just send a link. People talk to it, and you get back a recording, transcription, and summary. It's a fast way to capture thoughts that’s more personal than a form.

I’m looking for professionals, AI enthusiasts, or anyone with a side project. This will be a private beta run on a Slack channel.

In exchange for your feedback, I can offer:

* A coffee on me
* 1 year of premium access

1n7ld7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1n7ld7q/explore_if_dedcool_dryer_sheets_really_work_for/,Explore If DedCool Dryer Sheets Really Work for Sensitive Skin,"Testing out the DedCool DED-XM-DS dryer sheets felt like a little adventure in laundry luxury I didn’t know I needed. Being someone who cares about eco-friendly solutions and has sensitive skin, I was curious about its claim of being non-toxic, vegan, and kind to people like me who can't handle harsh chemicals. After multiple spins in my dryer, paired with various loads of laundry, I can confidently say I’ve developed some strong opinions about these fabric softener sheets.

**Signature Scent and Its Impact**  
The Xmilk fragrance is definitely the star here. Notes of bergamot, vanilla, and amber waft through my laundry room every time I toss one of these sheets into the dryer. I’ll admit, I initially worried it’d be too strong or cloying—but, surprisingly, the fragrance is subtle yet long-lasting. Walking around in clothes that smell this good feels like I dressed myself in a cloud of tiny, fancy candles. Even after a day of running errands, the scent lingered just enough to remind me of DedCool's magic touch.  

[Discover if DedCool DED-XM-DS is on sale at Amazon—check pricing here.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b0d87rr5rq/)  

**Eco-Friendly Design**  
The eco-conscious part of me was very happy to hear these sheets are biodegradable and crafted for sustainability. It’s rare to find a product that not only performs well but also aligns with green living values. DedCool has clearly thought about its environmental impact, and frankly, my conscience feels a little lighter knowing that fewer harmful chemicals or waste are heading for the landfill. Returning to an old-school dryer sheet seems unthinkable after this experience.

**Gentle yet Effective for Sensitive Skin**  
I’m not the only one in my family with sensitive skin—my toddler’s delicate outfits also end up in the mix. Traditional fabric softeners can sometimes cause slight irritation, but these dryer sheets came through on their promise. Every clothing item emerged static-free, impossibly soft, and gentle enough for even the most tender skin. I didn’t observe any itchiness or flare-ups, which is impressive given how many products seem to sneak in harsh additives. It feels good to trust a brand to prioritize safety AND performance.

**Versatility and Customization: A Unique Touch**  
I love playing mixologist with laundry scents, and these dryer sheets opened up a new world of possibilities. Pairing them with different detergents allows for a unique ""fragrance cocktail"" that you can’t really achieve with most other options. I even tried doubling up the sheets for extra freshness during bed linen washes, and boy, did my entire bedroom smell incredible for days. Bonus tip: toss one into a sock or underwear drawer for that constant touch of freshness—not sure why I didn’t think of this life hack earlier.

**Enhanced Convenience**  
What stood out most was how extremely convenient these were for day-to-day laundry. No measuring liquids or worrying about compatibility—just grab a sheet and toss it in the dryer. It’s a simple touch that makes laundry feel less like a chore. Plus, there’s no sticky residue on clothes, unlike some liquid fabric softeners.  

**Advantages**  
- Eco-friendly and biodegradable composition  
- Subtle yet long-lasting luxury fragrance  
- Kind to sensitive skin, ideal even for toddlers  
- Offers customizable scent combinations with other detergents  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The packaging could use some improvement; it isn’t resealable, so maintaining freshness might require extra storage precautions.  
- Price is a bit higher compared to generic dryer sheets, but for what it offers, most might consider it worth the splurge.  
- The fragrance might be too subtle for those who prefer stronger scents.  

**Market Rivals**  
Stacking these dryer sheets against others like Bounce Free and Gentle or Grab Green Stoneworks, a few key differences emerged. Compared to Bounce, DedCool has a unique edge in its non-toxic credentials and luxurious fragrance. While Bounce is widely available and affordable, it doesn’t deliver on the same sustainability promises. Grab Green Stoneworks comes close with eco-friendly features but lacks the soft, intriguing scents offered by DedCool. It’s a balance of priorities—if you value fragrance and skin-safe assurances without compromising on environmental impact, this product remains an impressive choice.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering its features and how well it performed across various cycles, this product is for someone willing to pay a little more for that added eco-friendliness and unique touch. It feels like switching from regular coffee to a handcrafted latte—not entirely necessary, but once you’ve had the upgrade, you don’t want to go back. Compare that to generic brands, and while DedCool might seem a tad indulgent, it never feels overpriced for the quality offered.

Other things this sub isn't for:

❌ Showing off your whole collection or recent ""hauls"" (this isn't a takedown of people who love to share photos of their large collection of a special interest plush or the like: I think a lot of us have really big collections and love to show them off! This is just not the sub for those particular pictures).

❌ Sales posts

❌ ISO (AKA ""in search of"" posts)

❌ Posts asking for the value of your collection or items you found

❌ Posts asking for advice

❌ Posts showing off large collections in one picture

❌ Posts about a plushie taken at the moment you bought it (think of at the store, or in the car right after, as in ""look at what I just bought"").

This sub's goal is to create a place for looking at and commenting on happy, wholesome pictures of stuffed animals without feeling so much FOMO over new plushie releases or other consumerism related feelings of a similar sort. It's ok if you're sharing your slice-of-life photos with a plushie that you know is highly sought after, or recently released, but keep the focus of the post on your stuffie friend, not on how hard it was to get them, how much you spent, how long you wanted them, etc.",1,1756920857.0,OurPlushieFriends,0,1.0,False

Their latest markdowns hit a lot of categories &mdash; from patio furniture to jewelry, luggage, mattresses and seasonal d&eacute;cor &mdash; plus a handful of low-price wardrobe staples and home gadgets. Here&rsquo;s a tidy breakdown of what's rolling out so shoppers can plan ahead.

**[Boscov's offers are available](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/boscovsevergreen?cid=boscovsnewdeal9032025Sep25_rddt)**
* Sale start: 9/04/2025 &mdash; Postings and promotions should match the designated start date.
* EXTRA 10% OFF Entire Patio Department
* EXTRA 20% OFF All Nova Star Jewelry
* EXTRA 20% OFF All LeVian Jewelry
* EXTRA 20% OFF All Fine Birthstone Jewelry
* EXTRA 20% OFF All American Tourister Luggage Collections
* EXTRA 20% OFF Most Mattresses
* $8.99 Preswick &amp; Moore 3/4 &amp; Long-Sleeve Tops
* $6.99 Runway Ready Fleece-Lined Leggings
* $2.99 Men's GILDAN&reg; Short-Sleeve T-Shirts
* $12.99 Men's U.S. POLO ASSN.&reg; Thermal Crews &amp; Henleys
* 50% OFF Entire Stock Harvest &amp; Halloween D&eacute;cor
* $49.99 POWERXL&trade; 5.3-qt. Luminex&trade; Air Fryer
* $79.99 HAMILTON BEACH&reg; FlexBrew&reg; Trio Coffee Maker
* Clearance sale: items at least 50% less than the ticketed price

**What to keep in mind**
* Start date: These offers are listed as beginning 9/04/2025. Timing matters for doorbusters and limited-stock items.
* Category extras: The ""EXTRA"" percent-off notes suggest an additional discount applied to sale prices in the listed departments (patio, jewelry, luggage, mattresses).
* Clearance depth: The clearance mention indicates many items will be at least 50% off the ticketed price &mdash; great for furniture, seasonal d&eacute;cor, or last-season clothing.
* Product deals: Several individual product price points are included (air fryer, coffee maker, apparel), which can be easier to track than broad-category promos.

**How shoppers can use these offers**

  1. Target big-ticket items first &mdash; mattresses, patio furniture and luggage with EXTRA 20% or 10% off can beat typical holiday markdowns.
  2. Snap up seasonal d&eacute;cor in the 50% off stock &mdash; ideal for early Halloween or harvest displays without paying full price.
  3. Look for the low-price apparel items (GILDAN tees, fleece-lined leggings) if basic layers are needed for fall wardrobes or donations.
  4. Consider small appliances at advertised prices like the POWERXL air fryer and Hamilton Beach brewer if a specific model is on the list &mdash; price drops like these sometimes have limited inventory.

**[Why choose Boscov's](https://www.dailybargains.com/out/boscovsevergreen?cid=boscovsnewdeal9032025Sep25_rddt)**

Boscov's combines category-wide percent discounts with specific low-price items and a deep clearance section, which is useful for shoppers who want both targeted buys (a particular mattress or jewelry piece) and bargain-hunting across departments. Their staged start date helps set expectations for when different promos go live.

**Top 4 ways to save at Boscov's with these discounts**
* Combine category &ldquo;EXTRA&rdquo; discounts with clearance finds &mdash; check the Patio, Jewelry and Mattress sections for already-marked items, then apply the extra percent off when the sale starts.
* Grab the advertised price-point items fast &mdash; $2.99 tees and $6.99 leggings are often limited in size/stock.
* Shop seasonal sections early in the 50% off harvest &amp; Halloween stock for the best selection and mix-and-match d&eacute;cor deals.
* Use the clearance and &ldquo;special offers&rdquo; pages on their site to find stacked savings &mdash; keep an eye on site banners and the store&rsquo;s specials/clearance hub for doorbusters and further markdowns.

Shoppers should plan for 9/04/2025 if they want first dibs. If tracking down a specific item (a LeVian or Nova Star jewelry piece, a mattress model, or an American Tourister luggage set), checking the category pages and clearance/special-offers pages right when the sale starts will help secure the best finds.",1,1756920829.0,dailybargains,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **San Francisco Giants vs. Colorado Rockies: A Tale of Two Teams (and a Lot of Ejections)**

**Parse the Odds: Giants Are the Morning Coffee of Baseball—Bitter but Reliable**  
The Giants enter this matchup as overwhelming favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.50** (implying a **66.67% chance of winning**). The Rockies, conversely, sit at **2.70** (a **37% implied probability**), which is about the same chance of correctly guessing a stranger’s Spotify password blindfolded. The spread is a 1.5-run edge for San Francisco, and the total runs line is set at 11.0. Given the Giants’ recent 7-4 win in this series—where they hit **four home runs** and the Rockies’ starter, Kyle Freeland, looked like a man who’d forgotten how to pitch—these numbers feel less like a prediction and more like a mercy ruling.

**Digest the News: Rockies Are Baseball’s Version of a Participation Trophy**  
Let’s start with the Rockies, who hold the MLB’s worst record at **39-100**. Their starter, Freeland, owns a 3-14 record this season, which is about as inspiring as a motivational speaker who only tells jokes about the weather. After failing to record an out in his most recent start, he was ejected for a bench-clearing brawl sparked by Rafael Devers’ home run trot. The Giants, meanwhile, are a wild-card contender with a **69-69 record**, winning nine of their last ten games. Their offense is a well-oiled Homerun-Express, led by Devers’ 30 HRs (tying him with the NL’s elite) and a bullpen that’s somehow managed a 3.18 ERA. Key injuries? None for the Giants, while the Rockies’ “injuries” include hope, competence, and maybe the ability to tie their cleats.

**Humorous Spin: This Game Is a Foregone Conclusion (With Some Dramatic Flair)**  
The Rockies’ pitching staff is like a sieve that’s been challenged to a sieve contest—and it’s losing. F

Is it actually possible to start beta testing apps **for cash** with literally *zero* experience? And I mean, real money, not those sketchy “earn a cup of coffee after six months” scams? Because every time I scroll TikTok or Insta, someone’s promising bagloads of money for tapping some screens on your phone – and usually, I’m wildly skeptical.  

But then… I stumbled across this, and my brain did a full-on “WHY didn’t I know this sooner?” spiral:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (I’m not kidding – someone stop me before I sign NDAs in my sleep).

If you’re confused, shocked, or just desperate for a little side hustle lightning, hear me out:

- Literally anyone can join (no coding, no weird quizzes, no needing to say “user oriented ergonomics” with a straight face).
- The signup is actually instantly satisfying. You don’t have to make a resume out of thin air.
- Apps want us – the everyday, non-developer, “my mom asks me to fix her phone” crowd.
- The best part? Payouts are **real** – PayPal, gift cards, sometimes even bonuses for good feedback!
  
I could NOT believe that **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** was that straightforward.  
You pick from dozens of beta tests, preview the app or game (from filters to fitness and business… it’s bizarre what people are launching right now??), and just… give your confused, accidental, human feedback.

You do NOT need a pile of tech jargon to pull this off.

Basic rundown for the skeptical (me, like an hour ago):

- Sign up at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (make it your “test”... pun totally intended).
- Browse a whole WALL of apps desperate for opinions.
- Download apps to test (phones and tablets get ALL the love).
- Report bugs, glitches, what confused you most (I even found a typo and they thanked me?!)
- Get paid for your feedback… like gasp, actual minimum wage or even more for some projects.

NO, you don’t have to pay to join. NO, you don’t have to quit your day job.

The crazy part? With no formal “tech” background, you get VIP access to brand new apps. And your regular-user feedback is golden for app devs.

Things I wish I’d known (so you don't go down a ""sketchy app"" Reddit spiral):

- Don’t buy or pay for any “premium” access.
- If you can type a paragraph about what didn’t work – you already have enough “skills”.
- Testers ARE needed – apps can’t launch with bugs!
- Too good to be true? Read the reviews, then try for yourself (but please, use **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** so you don't end up with a crypto virus).  

I’m both shocked **and** hyped:

$10 for finding a bug in a reading app?
$15 for sending feedback about confusing login screens?
$7 for trying the world’s wildest meditation app launch?

If you’re scrolling r/AIpoweredInfluencer at 2am, this might just be your upgrade. And if you’re lowkey jealous of everyone making side cash, try this out:

I've been using Claude Code for a while now and while it's incredibly capable, I'm running into a frustrating pattern that's making me question my workflow.

Today's example: I ran `/sc:analyze --focus database-schema` - literally just asking for an ANALYSIS of my database schemas. Claude correctly created the analysis report... but then proceeded to implement an entire bridge system, services, routes, and dashboards without me asking for any of it.

This happens way too often. I'll ask it to analyze something or explain a concept, and it goes into full implementation mode, creating files, refactoring code, setting up entire architectures. It's like asking someone to look at your car engine and they rebuild the whole thing while you're getting coffee.

The weird part is it clearly understands the command - it does the analysis perfectly - but then keeps going like it's on autopilot. 

Has anyone found reliable ways to make Claude Code more... restrained? I've tried being explicit (""ONLY analyze, don't implement""), but it's hit or miss.

Also, minor gripe but the constant ""Excellent point!"" and ""You're absolutely right!"" responses are wearing thin. I don't need validation, I need a tool that follows instructions. Is there a way to tone down the excessive agreeableness?

I love the tool's capabilities, but the unpredictability is becoming a productivity killer when I have to undo unwanted changes or sort through files I never asked for.

Because I just spent three HOURS deep-diving into this so-called “Get Paid to Click Captchas” rabbit hole, and.... What did I even witness?! 😳

You know how we all used to joke that eventually, robots would be the ones solving CAPTCHAs, while we kicked back or whatever?

Turns out, NOPE. Now, it's reversed — we're the ones solving endless CAPTCHAs…for *money*?? Welcome to 2024, I guess?

Here’s how it apparently works:

- You sign up for these app testing gateways—like those promising you’ll “TEST APPS FOR CASH!” or get instant cashouts just for solving puzzles or clicking boxes.
  
- The onboarding? It involves a suspiciously high number of CAPTCHAS. Seriously, you’d think you were logging into Fort Knox...but it's just [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp).
  
- Testers have to verify they’re real people (okay, sure), but sometimes it’s DOZENS of CAPTCHAs…before you even see any “test apps.”
  
- And after that? The payout screens look AMAZING but...are they real? Because [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp) flashes Paypal and Venmo logos like candy but there’s always a catch.

Not gonna lie—the hype is REAL when you first land on [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp).

Those $25 instant test bonuses and “easy money alerts” almost made me spit out my coffee. But my confusion only grew the longer I explored:

- Why does every task seem to loop into another CAPTCHA?
- Where do all these CAPTCHAs even come from? Is there a CAPTCHA factory somewhere in cyberspace?!
- Does anyone cash out without completing 395 “simple” offers?
- Am I secretly now a CAPTCHA robot because this literally took over my evening?

And if you finally beat the captcha-boss-level and hit the legendary “Payout” button…

BAM! You’re sent back to more testing, more identity checks, more “verifications”—all swirling around the same beautiful, swirling blue link: [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)

Seriously, what is the endgame here? Is it legit money? Or just a modern digital maze built for exhausted, hopeful humans with superhuman patience and nothing better to do?

If you or your friend’s cousin’s dog ever actually cashes out legit money from [**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**](https://goodnovel.org/testapp), please, I beg you, prove me wrong. 

Because right now all I’ve got is a sore wrist, a mountain of solved trees-traffic lights-crosswalks, and existential questions about humanity’s role in the battle against bots...

Shouldn’t the AI be paying US to test them, not the other way around?! 😵‍💫

What am I missing?! Is this the future? Or a hilariously cruel internet prank with extra steps?

*A practical guide to embracing your emotional world without spiritual complexity*

---

## Why We Run From Our Own Feelings 🏃‍♂️

Picture this: You're having a tough day at work, your boss criticizes your project, and immediately you reach for your phone, binge-watch videos, or grab that extra cup of coffee. Sound familiar?

We've all been there. The moment uncomfortable feelings arise, our instinct is to escape. But here's what most people don't realize - this emotional avoidance is like putting a band-aid on a leaking pipe. It might work temporarily, but eventually, the pressure builds up.

## The Hidden Cost of Emotional Suppression 💰

When we consistently push down our feelings, something fascinating happens in our bodies. Think of emotions as energy in motion. When we block this natural flow, it's like damming a river - the water has to go somewhere.

Research shows that chronic emotional suppression can manifest as:

• Persistent headaches and muscle tension
• Digestive issues and stomach problems  
• Sleep disturbances and fatigue
• Weakened immune system responses
• Increased anxiety and mood swings

Your body literally keeps the score of every emotion you've tried to ignore.

## The Revolutionary Approach: Feel to Heal 🔄

Here's a paradigm shift that changes everything: What if the very emotions you're avoiding are actually the key to your freedom?

Instead of viewing difficult emotions as problems to solve, consider them as important messengers delivering crucial information about your needs, boundaries, and values.

**The Feel-to-Heal Process:**

**Step 1: Recognition Without Judgment** 👁️
Notice when emotions arise without immediately labeling them as ""good"" or ""bad."" Anger isn't inherently negative - it might be signaling that your boundaries have been crossed. Sadness isn't weakness - it could be processing necessary grief or loss.

**Step 2: Create Space for Feeling** 🏠
Find a quiet moment to sit with your emotion. You don't need meditation cushions or spiritual practices. Simply sit comfortably and ask yourself: ""What am I feeling right now, and where do I feel it in my body?""

**Step 3: Express to Release** 🎯
Give your emotion a voice. This might mean:
- Writing in a journal for 10 minutes
- Having an honest conversation with a trusted friend
- Physical movement like walking or dancing
- Creative expression through art or music

## Practical Daily Strategies That Actually Work 💪

### Morning Emotional Check-in (3 minutes)
Before checking your phone, ask yourself: ""How am I feeling this morning?"" Name the feeling and rate its intensity from 1-10. This simple practice builds emotional awareness throughout your day.

### The 24-Hour Rule 📅
When strong emotions hit, commit to sitting with them for 24 hours before taking major action. This prevents reactive decisions while honoring the emotion's message.

### Emotional Vocabulary Expansion 📚
Instead of just ""fine,"" ""good,"" or ""bad,"" expand your feeling vocabulary:
- Frustrated → Specifically annoyed, overwhelmed, or blocked
- Happy → Energized, content, excited, or proud
- Sad → Disappointed, lonely, grieving, or nostalgic

### The Body Scan Technique 🔍
Throughout your day, pause and scan your body. Tight shoulders might indicate stress. A clenched jaw could signal anger. Your body often knows your emotions before your mind catches up.

## Breaking Common Emotional Myths 🚫

**Myth:** ""Strong people don't show emotions""
**Reality:** Emotional intelligence and resilience come from feeling and processing emotions effectively, not suppressing them.

**Myth:** ""Negative emotions are harmful""  
**Reality:** All emotions serve important functions. Fear protects us, anger sets boundaries, and sadness helps us process loss.

**Myth:** ""I should be able to control my emotions""
**Reality:** You can't control emotions from arising, but you can choose how to respond to them.

## The Workplace Application 🏢

Emotional awareness isn't just personal - it's professional gold. When you understand your emotional patterns:

- You communicate more clearly during conflicts
- You make better decisions under pressure  
- You build stronger relationships with colleagues
- You prevent burnout by recognizing early warning signs

**Office Strategy:** Before responding to a frustrating email, take three deep breaths and identify what you're feeling. This pause can transform reactive responses into thoughtful communication.

## Parenting and Relationships 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Teaching emotional processing to children (and practicing it yourself) creates healthier family dynamics:

**Instead of:** ""Stop crying, you're fine""
**Try:** ""I see you're upset. Can you tell me what you're feeling?""

**Instead of:** ""Don't be angry""  
**Try:** ""I notice you're angry. What happened that made you feel this way?""

This approach validates emotions while teaching healthy processing skills.

## The Long-term Transformation 🌱

People who consistently practice emotional awareness and expression report:

• Improved physical health and energy levels
• Stronger, more authentic relationships
• Increased creativity and problem-solving abilities
• Greater resilience during challenging times
• Enhanced self-understanding and confidence

## Creating Your Personal Emotional Freedom Plan 📋

**Week 1:** Practice the morning emotional check-in daily
**Week 2:** Add the 24-hour rule for strong emotions
**Week 3:** Implement body scans throughout your day
**Week 4:** Begin expanding your emotional vocabulary

## The Science Behind Emotional Release 🧠

Neuroscience reveals that unexpressed emotions create neural pathways that reinforce emotional suppression. However, when we consciously feel and release emotions, we literally rewire our brains for healthier emotional processing.

This isn't about becoming an emotional volcano - it's about becoming emotionally fluent. Like learning any skill, emotional processing improves with practice.

## Common Obstacles and Solutions 🛠️

**""I don't have time for feelings""**
Start with 2-minute emotional check-ins. Emotional awareness actually saves time by preventing larger emotional breakdowns later.

**""People will think I'm weak""**
Emotional intelligence is increasingly recognized as a leadership strength. You're modeling healthy behavior, not weakness.

**""My emotions are too intense""**
Intensity often comes from suppression. Regular emotional expression typically reduces overwhelming feelings over time.

## Moving Forward: Your Next Steps 🚀

Emotional freedom isn't a destination - it's a daily practice. Start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that every feeling is temporary and informative.

Your emotions aren't your enemies; they're your internal guidance system. When you learn to listen to them without fear, you unlock a level of self-understanding and life satisfaction that transforms everything.

The journey to emotional freedom begins with a single step: the willingness to feel what you're actually feeling, right now, without judgment or escape.

Your future self - healthier, happier, and more authentically you - is waiting on the other side of that feeling you've been avoiding.

Last year I started my own little camp and invited friends I met at Burning Man over the years.  This year I invited even more friends I met over the years and it all came together at the last minute.  We built our camp laughing and talking story then the winds hit hard!  Random people ran into our carport for shelter and if it wasn’t for those monkeys holding it down, we would have lost it… we were getting pummeled by gritty sand and random flying objects.  But our camp Burgin who joined at the last second appeared out of the dust with more 16 inch lag bolts and ratchet straps and secured that carport down so we could get a break.  I had some great photos, but SFGate seems to like to post my shit without permission, so had to take them down.  Our Burgin, Save the Day, got his playa name that day.  The storms forced us to stay in our little camp, talk story, drink, invite in others and just chill the fuck out.  It was perfect.  A mobile sound system on a bike needed shelter during the rain and he played for us all night and morning.  I loved every second of it!  After 10 burns things can start looking “the same” but this year was awesome - all my favorite Burning Man people stuck together in our little camp together.  We served coffee, we laughed, we drank, we ate food ALL DAY with no where to go.  It was the BEST YEAR EVER!  We joked that Burning Man came to us this year, we didn’t even need to leave our camp.  When we could actually leave camp, I was kinda bummed, but it was nice to get out too.  We all talked about how to make the car port stronger and what else would we do different next year… All we could think of was adding more couches and pillows (along with MORE ratchet straps and lag bolts). 

Blah Blah Blah, you don’t get the Burn you want, you get the Burn you need.  I had been feeling super lonely this year, but I am now fully recharged with old and new friendships.  

Can’t wait for next year and make our little camp a little bigger with the new friends we met during the storms…

**Chapter V**

**From Hell**

Kira and Lucifer were only flying for a few minutes when Lucifer’s phone went off. He paused and looked at the caller, then quickly answered. 

“Kenzō, what’s wrong?” Lucifer shouted, ""I can barely hear you and it’s not the wind!” He paused as he heard the yokai’s response, then he looked at Kira.

“What’s wrong?” Kira asked.

“The En-ha are being attacked, Kenzō needs backup, whoever it is has daemons.” Lucifer forwarded the link Astral had provided to Kira. “Find them and wait.” 

“What if they’re being hurt?” Kira snapped.

“Then you can act, but do not do so to cause a fight.” Lucifer warned, “I’ll be there as soon as I can.” 

Kira nodded and flew off, following the directions the tracker program sent to her phone. She came to a warehouse on the docks and landed as quietly as she could. She saw a pure white, unmarked van as she had landed and if that didn’t scream something was off she didn’t know what would. She crept along the top of the building until she heard a deep growl. She found a window and looked and focused her senses and felt the power of an angry Revenant below her. Kira marveled as she took in the depth of Ariane’s power, she had never seen the girl do more than evoke a few ghostly women but now a great ghostly grizzly was guarding her and an unconscious Ukiko. Ariane glowed like a golden statue while the bear was scarred and pale, but lit up brightly. Several human men paced the area but did not approach, though one held a shotgun and was clearly ready to use it at a moment’s notice.

Kira opened the window and slipped inside. It was easy, she had spent most of her life creeping in from one building or another in Russia and the people in Japan were far more trusting with their buildings. To her it was almost a joke to sneak in. She crept down from a ladder and kept to the darkness, keeping Ariane in her sight. Ariane was focused on the men around her clearly unwilling to back down from those that would hurt her mother. Kira smiled, she liked Ariane’s stubborn streak most of all.

“Hey, they get the En-ha yet?” One of the men called out.

“No, the Fallen showed up.” Another snorted. “Where’s the nephilim at?” 

Kira realized the men were working with the daemons. She reached into her pocket to make a call, but was suddenly picked up and tossed in front of Ariane. Ariane did not take her eyes off the men, but held out her hand for Kira. Kira took it and stood watching the men who seemed to take her presence as a joke.

“He sent...” The voice sent a wave of fear and nausea down Kira’s spine like nothing she had ever felt before, “The newbie...” 

The daemon stepped into the light, Kira recognized it as the daemon from when she first arrived, Astral had called him Casterum and mentioned he was a daemon-knight. She could feel the twisted power emanating and instinctively knew the human owner of that body was gone. She gritted her teeth and prepared herself for a fight.

“We good to kill them then?” One of the yakuza asked.

Casterum glared at the man, “We’ve already broken one of the rules, I won’t break anymore. I don’t need that kind of heavenly heat.” 

“What rules?” Kira asked.

“Not supposed to come after humans close to neflem.” Ariane glared at Casterum.

“Normally yes, but you had to be with her, so we didn’t have a choice, little revenant.” Castrerum laughed, “You know it took me way too long to realize what you were, I had to buy it from the one your papa fought.” 

“He’s a bad man.” Ariane frowned.

“And I’m a worse man.” Casterum laughed.

“Not even a man, you’re a fart wea-” Kira was interrupted as Casterum grasped her throat and lifted her high.

“No!” Ariane shouted and the bear roared, “TEDDY STOMP HIM!” 

“Teddy!” Casterum mocked as the bear ran at him, the daemon-knight backhanded the guardian spirit back into the aether. “Well that probably won’t work again, but damn is it good to shut that bear up.” 

Kira punched Casterum in the face as she struggled. 

Casterum looked up at her as he held her high and smiled, “Oh, you have fight in you kiddo. Like Astral, but less experienced. You know, I’d hold you for the boss, really make it sting for-” Casterum stopped as a shape passed over the window above him. “Boys, this one’s mine!” He tossed Kira towards Ukiko, knocking her unconscious from the force alone. Casterum stared up at the window and laughed.

Astral came crashing through the window, his wings once again spreading out, reaching further than they had ever done before, and draping around those below him like a heavy shield of feathers. His wings covered Ariane, Kira, and Ukiko and pulled Ariane closer as he silently sat Ariane next to Kira's unconscious form and nodded for her to heal the girl.

“I’m guessing you figured it out.” Casterum laughed, “Is my buddy Shrithe alive?”

“For now.” Astral growled, “Shrine of Inari, that was bold.” 

Casterum shrugged and smiled, then looked around, “Remember boys, he’s mine. You get to watch and watch only.” 

The yakuza laughed and spread out as they took seats.

Astral brought his wings closer to his body but did not retract them. Then he took a stance and watched as Casterum laughed, then roared and lunged at him. The two met and traded blow for blow. Astrals hands would strike and peel Casterum’s flesh that grew back instantly, while Casterum’s sharp talons would be deflected by Astral’s wings. Then the two separated and circled each other again.

“I have to admit, haven’t seen a feather duster use their wings like that before. Kind of annoying since we can’t rip them off.” Casterum growled.
 
“Oh, good. I was actually worried about that, but thanks for the tip.” Astral rushed in and smashed Casterum’s knee in followed by a powerful downward haymaker. 

Casterum roared and rushed forward, plowing Astral over and on to the ground where he pounced on the nephilim and clawed at him, but Astral’s wings once again were there as a shield. Casterum roared and got off his enemy once again. But he was smiling.

“Can’t keep this up forever Astral.” He mocked.

“Maybe not, but I can keep it up long enough.” Astral growled as he stood up. “Still got a fire in me.” He pounded his chest and felt a heat deep within his soul kindle and felt the same power from the small fire kami start to expand.

“Kami’s powers only go so far.” Casterum smiled as he rushed forward and produced his HellFire blade.

Astral mostly dodged the attack but the blade cut into his cheek and he immediately felt the power of the Kami fade from his body.

“Hellfire blades extinguish weaker divine power.” Casterum chuckled. “Quite honestly, we’re surprised the Infernals ever mastered them, but that just puts them a little bit closer to us, so we don’t mind.”

Astral growled but held his ground, even as he felt his own stamina wane, the toxins of the daemon-knight finally started to seep into his wounds and weaken him, but he would not give in. “As long as I am here, you won’t touch them.” 

Castrerum paused and growled, “Always with the selflessness! Do you have an idea how boring that is! I want the anger back, the drive to kill my boss for what he did to your kin!” 

Astral focused and took a stance once again. “He will pay, but I know where I’m needed.” 

Casterum snarled, “Well this just got boring.” He sighed and rushed forward and grabbed Astral by the neck with both hands and began to strangle the life from him. “You just had to disappoint me!” 

Astral struggled and drove more than a few powerful blows into the daemon-knights face and though he could tell they hurt, Casterum persisted until finally Astral’s vision blurred. Casterum laughed and was about to snap Astral’s neck when the world was filled with the sound of a shriek like few things Casterum had ever heard. The closest he could compare it to was a banshee and when he turned to see it was the revenant girl he was not surprised. So he dropped Astral and stalked over to the girl.

“STOP IT!” Casterum snarled.

She continued and the yakuza began to shudder and huddle together as the temperature dropped. Windows frozen from the cold snapped and shattered. The yakuza began to scream in terror and ran towards the doors. Casterum was about to smack the girl when she suddenly silenced herself and stared up and beyond Casterum like he wasn’t even there. Casterum stood and produced his blade once, again, expecting Astral to have recovered. 

What he saw when he turned was not a living being. Floating above Astral’s unconscious form, holding the scythe all daemons feared was a Reaper. A reaper whose glare was as ancient as Abbadon itself, a being that recalled when the first reaper arose and the first daemon spawned when the two first clashed and the daemons felt fear for the first time. Casterum was staring at the Reaper of Reapers and his mind could only reel in fear as the daemon’s only natural predator was glaring directly at him. He was running before he could comprehend how far away he had already fled. 

Ariane sniffled as the reaper lifted Astral and brought him over. The powerful entity had little in the way of a physical body, but two orbs seemed to glow in his hood and acted like eyes, moving and shaping his emotions. They were distraught as he sat Astral down and grabbed the broken form of Teddy’s stuffed body. He made an invisible gesture and the bear’s body mended itself with green and purple threads and then he handed it back to the young girl as his eyes became like hills against a full moon to form a smile. He patted her on the head and was about to leave when Astral finally came too.

Astral coughed and gasped as he focused on the Reaper. He looked over at Ariane and didn’t have to guess why the entity was here. Astral had lost and Ari had saved his ass by calling out for help and the Reaper had answered. He looked around for any sign of Casterum.

“The ugly man ran.” Ariane sniffled, “It isn’t the right time for him to talk though.” She nodded to the Reaper. “He wasn’t supposed to help, but he felt he had to. I think he’s got a friend who won’t let him forget it.”

The Reaper looked at Ariane with an accusatory, but entertained glare, then he slowly faded from view.

“Thanks.” Astral coughed and waved and noticed the yakuza were all unconscious and unresponsive.

“They’re lucky. He’s the one who doesn’t play nice.” Ariane nodded, “We need to help Mama ‘Kiko and Kira.” 

Astral nodded and moved to Ukiko’s side and began to apply Babel’s healing effects to her.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Ukiko woke up in pain and in panic. The last thing she had remembered was the twisted form of a daemon grinning as he ripped the door off her car. She had no time to react and before she knew it she was somewhere else, her thoughts were muddled as she tried to recall what had happened. Then she noticed she was in a hospital bed and it was very late. She looked around the room and saw Astral asleep on a recliner, Ariane resting on his chest, covered by his coat. She sighed and noticed movement to her side. She looked to see Kira, awake and staring at the ceiling.  

“You’re awake.” Kira sighed, “Good, he was scared shitless.” 

Ukiko nodded, “You came to help?” 

“And I lost.” Kira grumbled, “Almost got you killed too.” 

More movement caught Ukiko’s attention as Ariane crawled onto Kira’s bed and cuddled against the teenager. 

“No more bad thoughts.” Ariane mumbled sleepily.

Ukiko couldn’t stop smiling but winced as she remembered the events of the evening. She looked around in panic and saw Astral looking back at her, something almost alien and equally calming about his blue eyes reflecting in the darkness made her pause and collect her thoughts as she realized he was now awake too. He stood up and sat at the end of Ukiko’s bed and took her hand.

“Gave us a scare.” Astral tried to smile. “Will you let one of the angels teach you, please?” 

Ukiko nodded, she did not want to be that defenseless ever again. “He was setting a trap. Something about a ritual.” 

“We had some help in that regard. I wouldn’t call it a full win, but they didn’t win either.” Astral smirked, “Inari’s shrine is kinda wrecked though. Priestess there didn’t seem too upset though.” 

“He got his butt kicked too.” Kira yawned, “Ari saved us all.” 

Astral nodded, “She’s good at that.”

“Teddy?” Ukiko asked.

Astral shook his head, “A Reaper.” 

Ukiko’s eyes went wide with fear, “Like the one from Christmas?”

“The same one, actually.” Astral nodded, “We’re in someone's grand game and I don’t like it, but he doesn’t seem to like it either. For now he’s a friend, I think.”

Ukiko nodded, “The daemon?” 

“That was Casterum, he’s still alive. Apparently he took one look at that Reaper and fled.” Astral chuckled.

Movement in the room revealed Lucifer curled up on another recliner.

“Could you keep it down please?” He yawned.

“No. Ukiko’s awake.” Astral snapped.

Lucifer raised the back of his recliner, “I spent the better part of the evening distracting your father, Ms Kanade. He is very hard to distract. But he will be ecstatic to know you’re awake.”

“Thank you, Lucifer.” Ukiko smiled. 

Lucifer nodded, “And of course he would run, Reapers exist to destroy them. They’re daemon’s natural predators.” 

“Thought that was whoever was the strongest faith?” Astral countered.

“No, we became the stewards of Humanity. Reapers hunt all daemons, those on Earth, those from other worlds. They exist purely to ensure a soul gets to its natural end. They can do things to them we could only dream of.” Lucifer yawned, “Another reason Metty is skittish of them, but they’re really no threat to us unless we interfere.” 

“Do they help the living?” Ukiko asked.

“Not normally.” Lucifer turned over.

“Tired.” Ariane mumbled from Kira’s bed, “Quiet please.” 

“Listen to the child.” Lucifer added with an annoyed huff.

Astral smiled and shrugged. Ukiko nodded and leaned back. Astral leaned in and kissed her and rubbed her cheek before he went back to the chair.

When the sun rose, Ukiko was quickly awoken by Ariane slipping onto her bed and cuddling into her chest. Ukiko smiled and hugged her daughter. She noted Lucifer and Astral were absent and Kira was still asleep.

“They’re getting coffee and donuts.” Ariane smiled, “I want one with strawberry sprinkles.” 

Ukiko smiled and waited for a few minutes before a nurse came in and sat a tray next to Ukiko’s bed and one next to Kira’s. The nurse tried to gently wake up Kira, but the girl refused to wake up and mumbled in Russian.

“She had a rough night, we’ll try and get her up in a bit.” Ukiko smiled with a nod.

The nurse nodded and left after showing Ukiko her breakfast of scrambled eggs, toast and hashbrowns. 

“Ah, hospital food.” Lucifer smiled as he and Astral entered the room. 

“Stuff here’s actually good, don’t knock it.” Astral commented and handed a pink donut to Ariane who laughed happily and bit into it. “The doctors still have to figure out how long to keep you.” 

“I can imagine it’s a bit odd.” Ukiko sighed.

“They don’t like me telling them what to do with daemon toxins.” Lucifer smiled, “But you’re awake and I have an angry collection of souls to go calm down again.” 

“Tell him to behave.” Ukiko said with a huff.

Lucifer let out a barking laugh but bowed in acknowledgement as he left.

Astral smiled and sat at the end of Ukiko’s bed and put a cup of coffee on her tray. “For you, three creams, sugar, and some vanilla, if I remember.” 

“Oh!” Ukiko smiled and took the drink. “You did. Thank you.” 

Astral nodded, “I barely busted up their plans, using those drachmas to syphon people’s souls and plant daemons faster.” 

Ukiko starred in shock. “That’s disgusting. And makes disturbing sense.”

Astral nodded and picked up Ariane. “So we’re going to go home, get some rest on our end. Clean up this little nightmare and get you home and recuperating. Same with the delinquent.” 

“I’m not a delinquent...” Kira grumbled.

Ukiko giggled. 

“She has a gang.” Astral said flatly.

“I don’t have a gang!” Kira shouted and rolled over in her bed.

“She’s a bit shy about it.” Astral smirked, “Be gentle.” 

Ukiko sighed and nodded. “I’ll call with our timelines. Go get her clean and some sleep on an actual bed.” 

Astral put Ariane down and patted her head.

“See you at home, Mama ‘Kiko, Kira.” Ariane waved as she followed Astral out.

Kira snorted and rolled back over to face Ukiko, who was staring at her while sipping her coffee.

“So, a gang?” Ukiko smiled.

“It’s not a gang. They’re just socially awkward and were bullying a guy one liked. Now they’re like best friends for me?” Kira sighed, “But apparently we’re a gang.”

“I might advise toning down the fights.” Ukiko smiled. “Breakfast is actually good.” 

“Wanna sleep.” Kira rolled over again and pulled her blanket over her head.

Ukiko smiled and remembered when she would say that to her father. Then she frowned as she tried desperately not to feel too old. Her smile came back though as she saw a piece of the strawberry donut that Ariane had left behind for her.

1n7kzas,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n7kzas/having_a_hard_time_giving_myself_and_you_some/,"Having a hard time, giving myself (and you) some advice","

I’m in a rough patch on my healing journey (missing my ex but knowing he isn’t right for me, at least not now or anytime soon, and I don’t have my hopes up for the future at all). 

So here is some stuff that has helped (as a reminder to myself and hopefully provides some comfort or motivation to you!) 

- Self-improvement/distractions 

So cliche but I’ve found this to be the #1 helpful thing. I sadly gained quite a bit of weight during the relationship, so I’ve been focusing on my health. My job is tolerable, so I’ve been using work as a distraction, taking on more projects than I would normally and really applying myself. I’ve signed up for dance classes, go on lots of walks, read at coffee shops on the weekend. I just keep myself busy and am focused on things that matter to me/make me better. Every day I do something for myself. 

This is also a good time to really get into your physical self care. So do your skin care, make yourself good meals, exercise, drink water, get rest, etc. 

- Letting myself feel whatever I’m feeling

Sometimes I’m really, really sad and cry throughout the day. Sometimes I miss my ex so much. Sometimes I am so angry with him, sometimes I’m angry with myself. Sometimes I’m annoyed or jealous of the people around me who have what I want. All that is okay. What isn’t okay is making my emotions other people’s problem or expecting my ex to make it all up to me so I’ll feel better. No. I let myself cry, if I’m in public and need to excuse myself to the restroom to go cry, I do it. If I need to go for an aimless drive and play angry music, sad music, our music, whatever - I let myself feel everything and remind myself it will pass. Like right now I’m not crying, but I was earlier today. This is proof that the worst times really don’t last forever and there are times in between that aren’t so bad. 

- I remember that while my relationship with my ex is over, a new relationship has formed with myself 

I am my biggest comforter now. I am really gentle with myself, but also firm at the same time. If I want to cave and reach out to him, I remind myself it won’t actually feel good in the long run. I take comfort in the fact that at least I have myself. This is a good time to repair the relationship with yourself. All the times you self-abandoned, took less than you deserved, tried so hard for someone who just wasn’t capable of returning that same love and care, that wears away at your self-esteem and confidence. So during this time, I’m reclaiming my confidence and vowing to not ever forget this chapter. I am awake to all the ways I was/am unhappy with myself and working on that relationship. When I look at it that way, I might still be sad that the romantic relationship with my ex is over, but at least I have this new, meaningful and important relationship with myself. 

Hope this helps and sending big hugs to anyone who’s hurting.

1n7kvmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1n7kvmz/spotlight_best_countertop_ice_maker_silonn/,Spotlight best countertop ice maker Silonn SLIM07B worth it or not,"I’ve been using the Silonn SLIM07B ice maker on my kitchen countertop for a while now, and I must say, it has integrated itself into my daily routine effortlessly. There’s something about having fresh, bullet-shaped ice cubes ready in just six minutes that has completely spoiled me. Whether I’m preparing an iced coffee in the morning or hosting friends with chilled drinks, this sleek little machine has become my go-to appliance. It’s quiet, quick, and surprisingly fun to use, but as with any product, I’ve found a couple of quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Silonn SLIM07B has a compact design that fits perfectly on my countertop. Measuring just 12 x 9 x 14 inches, it doesn’t hog space, which is a big plus if you have a smaller kitchen. The black Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene material gives it a modern and polished appearance, making it an aesthetically pleasing addition to avoid those chunky, industrial-looking machines. The transparent lid is a super handy feature that allows me to peek at the ice-making process. It’s lightweight too, only about 17.5 pounds, which means I can occasionally move it around when needed, like for parties in my living room.  

**Ease of Use and User-Friendly Features**  
I love how intuitive the control panel is. It’s as simple as filling the 2.2L water tank, pressing the ON button, and selecting your desired ice cube size. In moments when I almost forgot to refill the water or noticed the basket getting too full, the built-in sensor system kicked in with its LED indicators to alert me. This kind of feature not only makes it user-friendly but ensures I don’t accidentally damage the machine by overloading it.  

**[View Silonn SLIM07B deals on Amazon now.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0cjy6jkks/)**

**Performance and Efficiency**  
This ice maker performs impressively well. It churns out nine ice cubes in just six minutes, which is absurdly fast compared to other ice makers I’ve tried in the past. On a busy day, it can make up to 26 pounds of ice in 24 hours, which is plenty for most households or even small gatherings. I frequently switch between the two available ice cube sizes; the smaller cubes are ideal for cooling seafood or keeping beer frosty, while the larger cubes are better suited for slowly chilling cocktails or sodas. The 160-watt motor runs super quietly, emitting less noise than my refrigerator. I can barely hear it working unless I’m standing right next to it.  

**Positives**  
- Produces ice cubes in just six minutes, making it incredibly fast.  
- Compact and lightweight design fits small spaces.  
- Features two different ice cube sizes to cater to various needs.  
- Quiet operation, producing noise below 35 dB.  
- Transparent lid for monitoring the ice level.  
- LED indicators for low water and basket capacity alerts.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The 2.2L water tank requires frequent refilling if you use it heavily.  
- Ice cubes aren’t stored at a freezing temperature and may melt over time if not immediately transferred to a freezer.  

**Competing Brands**  
Having owned another portable ice maker in the past, I found the Silonn SLIM07B outshined several competitors, especially those by Igloo and Euhomy. The Igloo models tend to be bulkier and produce louder noise levels during operation. Meanwhile, Euhomy boasts similar ice production capabilities but often lacks the simple, intuitive interface that this machine provides. That said, if you’re looking for a machine with insulation to keep the ice frozen longer, some other premium models might perform better in retaining the ice.

**Worth Every Penny**  
In terms of price justification, the Silonn SLIM07B offers solid value for anyone who uses ice frequently but doesn’t want to overpay for bulky commercial-grade machines. It balances affordability with great performance and a variety of useful features. Although there are some minor inconveniences, they’re far outweighed by the convenience, speed, and versatility it brings to the table.

I’m knitting socks as Christmas gifts for my family and the one I did for my mom (fashion is my passion by stoneknits) for her birthday, one column of the lips turned out wonky. I want the Christmas socks to have identical motifs.

I’m working these patterns (all are by stoneknits):

1. Spicy socks
2. Fancy a cuppa
3. Purr-fect socks
4. Groove is in the heart
5. Coffee break
6. Blooming lavender
7. Retro gamer socks
8. Pizza night socks
9. Swan lake socks

I’m (21m) going to try to explain this the best I can. I’m going through a lot of emotions right now and I just need to scream into the void. 

I, last year met this girl, we’ll call Raven (21F) and we became really good friends. Like she was one of my number ones pretty fast. And we kinda had a weird little situation going on? We never had sex, she’s asexual and I dont care about sex. So out hangouts evolved into weird little gap sessions I’d look forward too, late night food runs at 2am, and one time we even took a couples quiz together. There was one night she even opened up to me about ultra personal things she said she’s never told anyone, and she just laid on me talking. I don’t wanna say I caught feelings because honestly? I didn’t think she was interested because she straight up said she wasn’t. So I never perused her, we stayed friends. At one point she made a joke about me pretending to be her boyfriend so she could get a hysterectomy. Since in my state you basically have to have male approval for it. I laughed and she laughed and we jokes about it a couple times but that’s as far as that went.

Now around this time she actually starts talking to one of my buddies, and she’s talking. About him but still hanging out with me, but she pulls back on almost everything so I just kinda go “fuck it” and around this time i became friends with Millie (20F)

Me and Millie start flirting lowkey and Raven knows, and she pulls away even more to where she’s barely talking to me in class, we stop hanging out, and she’s talking just kinda moves on.

Around this time i became really unwell, idk what was going on but my paranoia was through the roof and I think i had a manic episode. During this one of me and Ravens mutual friends texts me saying “Raven has been talking mad shit about you” 

I snap, that sent me over the edge. I became super distrustful of everyone, and I made the mistake of blocking Raven and that friend everywhere. And not to long after that me and Millie start dating.

When me and Millie started dating I noticed Raven became a lot softer. She’s a very tough woman, im talking like her black hair, like 26 tattoos, has a very “no shit” kind of personality. But she’s softer, she didn’t really look at me anymore, she stopped talking to me completely. And at the time that’s what I wanted, I thought I was happy.

The relationship with Millie was 7 months long. And that was probably the worst 7 months of my life. Slowly she made me cut off my friends, she talked shit about me and hung out with her ex while dating me and I didn’t even know until after we broke up. She was pushing for marriage after 2 months. She faked a miscarriage to keep me around. I don’t know why I stayed, maybe I was sick and she was giving me attention, maybe I gaslit myself into believing everything was OK. But at the end of summer I broke up with her and all hell went loose. 

She was making post on TikTok and Instagram about “shitty ex-boyfriend’s”, threatened to show up at my house, holding my stuff, ransom, texting my family and what little friends I had at the time demanding that they give her access to me, and even accuse me of cheating on her. So I wasn’t doing hot. 

Me and Raven’s mutual friend ended up reaching out to check on me. And he apologized for everything, he listed off everything that he did wrong and how bad he felt doing that to me.  I asked why he told me anything and he said he didn’t know, but he wanted to change and so far he’s proving he is changing.

Now to Raven. I tried adding her back on Snapchat once while I was still with Millie, and she shot me down real quick. Which I don’t blame her for. I did genuinely miss being her friend, I miss hanging out with her, I miss being around her. And it felt like that was gone.

But when this college semester started, I noticed she was actively going out of her way to talk to me. She was joking around with me in a way she hadn’t in months. Talking to me like absolutely nothing happened. But every once in a while, she would snap back to how she was acting for like a day, but then the next day immediately go back to acting like nothing was wrong.

Tonight I saw her and we sat down and genuinely talked for the first time in a while. I’ll do my best to give a play-by-play of the entire interaction.

I walk into the classroom where she is and she points at me and goes  “OP! How dare you not bring me a monster?” Referring to the fact that I brought a monster for myself. I made a joke about “don’t worry I’ll get you next time.” And she said “yeah you better, your life depends on it” and then she started full belly laughing. So like a minute later, I went out to the vending machine and bought her a monster. I don’t really know why I did, but I wanted to I guess.

I came back in and gave it to her, and I saw her face light up in a way I hadn’t seen in awhile. She looked at me and said “holy shit you’re the best” and then she balled up her hands and motion them towards me. I’m not totally sure what she’s trying to do, but she shakes them at me so I hold them because I don’t know what else to do.

“ my life is forever in your debt, which honestly is kind of scary” she said and we both laughed. 

Then out of nowhere, she asked how I was doing after the break up. News of the break up spread really fast since I live in a small college town and everyone kinda knows each other. I’ve gone through and I have apologized to pretty much all of my friends and I’m lucky that they’ve all been receptive. Everyone down here is on my side and aren’t listening to a word Millie is saying. So I give her some of the spark notes and she is sitting there with her mouth wide open in shock. 

She mentioned that she had a weird situation over the summer that ended really messy too, so she understood. We kept talking and joking like everything was normal and then out of nowhere. I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee sometime to talk about everything because I had some things I wanted to say to her.

She smiled really big and said “yeah I’d love that. I have some things I wanna say to you too. “ in this soft voice she never uses. She never uses some other people join us and now we’re all talking and joking around in a group.

At the end of the rehearsal, I get down from my seat and I start to fall, I end up catching myself before I could fall, but she ran directly to my side with her arms out.

R- “ dammit OP, I was supposed to catch you”

M-oh if I was going to fall, I think I’d try to aim for someone else, I ain’t gonna do that to you 

R- “NO dude, you’re supposed to be my damsel in distress, and I’m here to rescue you” 

We both laugh again and then after that, we parted ways. While my friend was driving me home, I got the urge to try adding her on Snapchat again. And she accepted within like 30 seconds.


Now do I like her? I don’t really know. I’m not in the headspace to put up with another relationship right now, especially with how badly this last one ended. All I want from her is to be her friend again. Tonight we kind of acknowledged some things, but we’ll be planning a coffee hang out soon to talk about it in depth. I’m kind of nervous about seeing her, when she had me hold her hands tonight I’ll be honest, I found my heart flutter just a tiny bit. But I don’t want a relationship, and I don’t think she does either. I don’t think I’m really coming here for advice, just to scream into the void about what the hell the past year has been. I’ve made a shit ton of mistakes and I’m doing everything I can to make up for them. I’m so incredibly lucky that I didn’t lose every single one of my friends and that Raven even wants to give me a chance to be her friend again.

I feel like shit, but I know everything is going to be OK. I’m doing everything in my power to make it right. And tonight was a really good sign. 

Thank you so much.

1n7kl53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1n7kl53/evaluate_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_ksupreme/,Evaluate the best coffee maker Keurig K-Supreme worth buying or not,"Testing out the Keurig 062151515284 coffee maker was an everyday affair over the past month, and let me tell you, making coffee has never been this satisfying. The first thing I noticed when the box arrived was how sleek and compact this machine is. It fits perfectly on my countertop without taking up much space – a pro when kitchen real estate is tight. But, as they say, looks aren’t everything. I was ready to dive into the features and performance of this coffee maker to see if it’s worth all the buzz.

---

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, this coffee maker makes a statement with its contemporary design. The build feels sturdy, and the removable water reservoir with its dual-position option is a game-changer. I’ve moved it around a bit to see how it fits different counter positions, and the flexibility is genuinely brilliant. It also helps simplify water refills, making morning coffee less of a chore. The buttons on the machine are tactile and well-placed, which is always a bonus for those groggy pre-caffeine moments. What really impressed me was the travel-mug-friendly size; no more coffee splashes from trying to balance an oversized mug under a regular machine.

---

**MultiStream Technology: The Game-Changer**  
This coffee maker is the first in its series to boast Keurig’s MultiStream Technology, which saturates coffee grounds more effectively. Honestly, it does make a noticeable difference. The flavor and aroma extracted feel richer compared to other machines I’ve used. I decided to do a side-by-side taste test with my old drip coffee machine, and this one edged out every time with a smoother, fuller-tasting cup. 

[Check Keurig 062151515284 price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b08gm76wm8/)  

---

**Winning Points**  
- MultiStream Technology delivers fantastic flavor extraction.  
- Dual-position water reservoir offers convenience and counter-space flexibility.  
- Multiple brew sizes ranging from 6 to 12 oz allow for customized servings.  

---

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
Brewing coffee with this machine is ridiculously easy. Whether you’re using pods or your own ground coffee, it takes only a few minutes to produce a steaming hot cup. The strong brew option became a favorite, especially for mornings where I needed a caffeine kick. It’s hard not to appreciate just how effortless the manual controls are to use, even for someone who’s technologically challenged. And if iced coffee is more your thing, this machine has you covered. Brewing directly over ice had me sipping on refreshing cold brews during those scorching summer afternoons. 

---

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The machine can be a bit noisy during the brewing process.  
- Taller water reservoirs would mean fewer refills.  
- Plastic construction may not be for everyone who expects a premium feel.  

---

**Competing Products**  
Taking a look at its competitors, I compared the Keurig 062151515284 to the Nespresso VertuoPlus and a basic Hamilton Beach drip coffee maker in my kitchen. The Nespresso machine has a more premium build and performs better for those who adore fancier coffee drinks like lattes or cappuccinos, but it falls short in versatility because it doesn’t accommodate ground coffee. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach model is more affordable, but it doesn’t come close to providing the same richness and flavor intensity. For general coffee drinkers who prioritize speed, taste, and customization, the coffee maker outshines both in daily usability.

---

**True Value**  
Thinking about the price, this machine lands somewhere in the middle of budget coffee makers and luxury ones. While it might not be dirt cheap, the features make it feel worth every penny. Factors like the MultiStream Technology, multiple brew sizes, and the versatility with pods and ground coffee make this a smart spending choice. It’s one of those machines that feels like an investment in better coffee mornings.

1n7kgup,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLiverFlush/comments/1n7kgup/1st_liver_flush_experience/,1st Liver Flush Experience,"I finally completed my first liver flush through Andreas Moritz' Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush protocol. I've known about flushes for a while but didn't have the courage to do one, especially since enemas are a part of the protocol and I wasn't accustomed to those. I started out by getting used to both water and coffee enemas first for a few weeks. After those were no big deal, I started the flush. 

Experience: It was easier than I thought. I opted to drink 8oz tart cherry juice leading up to the night of the flush every day (Day/night 6). I didn't stick with the exact times for the flush, which state to begin epsom salt drink at 6:00pm and 8:00pm. I took those later in the evening. The epsom salt drink was the worst part about the entire thing for me honestly, the taste is gross. I drank the olive oil/grapefruit/citrus drink around midnight and then went to bed. Unfortunately I vomited the majority of the mixture up at 2:00am, so I was expecting not to release any gallstones...but I was wrong! 

The next morning I finished the 3rd and 4th epsom salt drinks, and then a few hours later...the flood gates opened. lol. I passed about 20 visible gallstones, all tan or black in color. This was surprising to me since I couldn't keep the mixture down the whole night...I potentially released some liver flukes/critters, but I'm not 100% sure on that. I was pretty tired from all the bathroom visits and going to bed late, but I did feel more clear headed and my digestive tract felt incredibly clean.

We technically wont be charging any money for the book but since it is part of our marketing plan I assume we will need the proper licensing for each photo.

1n7kfug,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n7kfug/explore_the_fellow_aiden_coffee_maker_review_is/,Explore the Fellow Aiden Coffee Maker review is this drip machine worth it?,"The Fellow EBRMB-NA Aiden Coffee Maker caught my attention recently, as I’m always on the lookout for coffee gear that elevates morning routines. A machine promising precision drip brewing, thermal carafe functionality, and customizable features sounded too good to pass up. With its modern design and innovative tweaks, I decided to give this coffee maker a whirl in my own kitchen. While it’s mostly been a delightful experience, a few quirks deserve mention, making this review as balanced and honest as possible.

**Stylish Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its aesthetic appeal—it looked right at home on my countertop with its matte black finish and streamlined modern design. Unlike bulky coffee machines that yell ""appliance,"" this felt like the lovechild of Scandinavian minimalism and high-tech sophistication. Measuring 9"" x 11.8"" x 9"", it fits snugly without hogging counter space, which would make it perfect for smaller apartments or kitchen nooks. It’s not all about looks, though. The materials feel robust—especially the thermal carafe—and while it weighs a hefty 15.4 pounds, I appreciated that this gave it a sturdy, stay-put vibe. Still, moving it around for cleaning required a little more effort than I’d have liked.

**Effortless Brewing Experience**  
Using this machine every morning has been a breeze. Brewing coffee involves one click—yes, one click thanks to the single-button brewing function. Even groggy mornings didn’t deter me from making pour-over-quality coffee. The interchangeable baskets for single-serve and batch brewing felt tailor-made for fluctuating needs; whether I wanted a quick solo cup or needed 10 cups for brunch guests, the machine didn’t miss a beat. The drip-stop filter basket avoided those messy spills that plague older models I’ve tried, and the removable water tank was a game-changer for convenience. I could refill it directly at the sink without wrangling awkward angles.

**[Check Fellow EBRMB-NA price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d8hvbvs6/)**

**Brewing Capacity and Performance**  
One feature I’ve grown to love is its flexibility in brewing volumes. Many coffee makers lose their mojo when shifting between single and batch brewing, but not this one. Whether brewing one cup or all ten, the dual showerheads evenly distributed water across the coffee grounds, leading to consistent and robust flavors. I let my coworker, who’s a self-proclaimed “coffee snob,” test the bloom cycle function, and even he admitted that the machine “got it right.” That’s high praise from someone who usually swears by manual drippers! The thermal carafe kept coffee surprisingly warm for hours, which saved me from reheating it—a bonus during long workdays when I’m sipping between Zoom meetings.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Modern and compact design that suits any kitchen aesthetic  
- Convenient one-button brewing function for effortless mornings  
- Dual brew baskets and even water distribution for consistent flavor, regardless of quantity  
- Drip-stop filter basket and removable water tank reduce mess and boost user-friendliness  

**Steam and Cord Management**  
Another clever addition was a silicone seal designed to redirect steam away from overhead cabinets—something I didn’t think I needed until I used it. In my small kitchen with tightly packed storage, such details matter! The hidden cord wrap was equally thoughtful, keeping the setup neat and preventing tangled power cords from taking over the counter. It’s little design flourishes like these that made the machine feel premium and considered from a user’s standpoint.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The machine’s weight is noticeable, making it less ideal for those who need to move their appliances often.  
- The initial setup instructions leaned more on the vague side—they could improve the manual quality.  
- As handy as it is now, some key features like scheduling via the app weren’t available yet at the time of this review.  

**Exploring the Competition**  
Comparing it to other coffee makers in the same league, the Aiden Coffee Maker's ability to brew consistent flavors stands out. Machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster offer excellent performance but lack modern features such as the draft steam-seal or app integration tease (even if not active yet). The Breville Precision Brewer brings competitive brewing diversity, though its setup feels overly complex compared to the simplicity of this one. If you prioritize sleek design and single-touch operation over programmability, the Fellow model definitely shines.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the features and thoughtful design elements packed into this coffee machine, I’d say it leans toward premium but delivers value for its price range. Some alternative machines might offer an extended range of active features for a slightly higher cost, yet this model balances performance and user-friendliness quite well. Sure, the app function would’ve been a cherry atop the sundae if it were ready, and there’s some room for improvement in the instruction manual—but the overall performance made those feel secondary.

If you feel that way, I'd ask that you please just disregard this post and not engage with it.

I'm a 39-year-old gay guy who has been living in Manhattan for the past 15 years. For the past 4, I've been going to law school part-time while working full-time. The lack of free time, combined with friends moving away and the upheaval of the early Covid days, caused my social life to contract. With just a small handful of credits left to complete in law school, I'm hoping to start rebuilding it.

One of my many interests is food. Although I don't have the time or the kitchen to do much cooking, I love going out to restaurants. I find that eating out doesn't need to be crazy expensive, and that it's a great, straightforward way to build relationships. Although I'm a light drinker, drinks are also a fine place to start. Coffee too.

I also love dogs, books, movies, exploring areas of the city I don't already know well, volunteer work, and live theater (although the latter can get pricey, so it tends to be an occasional treat), among other things.

I'm not imposing rules or requirements. If you're a reasonably considerate adult gay guy living in or near the city and hoping to meet new people, feel free to get in touch by DMing or commenting here, and tell me a little about yourself. Happy to exchange non-Reddit socials, to take some of the anonymity out of the situation. Thanks!

1n7kevw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n7kevw/from_secretary_to_ceo_the_journey_of_a_woman_who/,"From Secretary to CEO: The Journey of a Woman Who Chose Herself, Found Love, and Conquered a Life of Independence and Respect","
— You’re still running around as a secretary? Couldn’t manage anything bigger, huh? — her ex sneered, unaware that she was now his boss’s wife. These words lingered in Sophia Reynolds’ mind for years, like a cruel whisper that could never be erased. She remembered laughing back then, nodding politely, forcing a smile, unaware that life had far tougher lessons in store for her than a passing offense. Now, years later, when her life had taken a completely different path, it seemed like a bitter, ironic joke.

Sophia always arrived at the office fifteen minutes early. It wasn’t out of ambition or to impress anyone. It had become a habit, almost a ritual—a small personal order in a world full of chaos and unpredictability. While the other employees hurriedly finished their coffee in the corridor, she was already at her desk, sorting mail, preparing documents for signature, and reviewing the director’s schedule. Her workspace—a modest desk directly in front of Martin Fischer’s office—was a model of precision. Files were arranged by color and date, pens were perfectly parallel to the desk edge, and the phone angled precisely forty-five degrees to the monitor. Colleagues often teased her about her meticulousness, but when something needed to be found or verified quickly, everyone came to Sophia.

— Sophia, where’s the contract with “System Plus”? — asked someone from sales, glancing over a stack of papers.

— Third shelf, blue folder, “Active Contracts, S-T” section, — she replied without looking up from her computer.

And indeed, the contract was always exactly where she said it would be. For some, it seemed trivial, but for Sophia, every detail mattered: order in the documents reflected order in the mind, and order in the mind reflected order in life.



Her husband, Daniel, worked in the same sales department. Tall, with slightly messy light brown hair and perpetually wrinkled shirts, he was her complete opposite. If she was the embodiment of precision and discipline, he was chaos incarnate. His desk looked like a battlefield: papers, pens, coffee mugs, and notes stacked into precarious towers. Sophia had learned to see the method in his madness, but only after years of cleaning up after him.

— Dan, you forgot to submit the invoice to accounting again, — she would say after work, walking to the car.

— Ah, right. I’ll send it tomorrow, — he waved her off, already thinking about something else.

And tomorrow, he would forget again, leaving Sophia to gently remind accounting that Daniel Reynolds’ request was on its way. She loved him—or at least she thought she did. But over time, that love became a burden, tinged with fatigue and subtle bitterness she couldn’t admit even to herself. She realized that support had always been one-sided: she helped him, corrected his mistakes, protected his reputation, and received only irritation and misunderstanding in return.

They had met back in university. Back then, it seemed romantic to build a career side by side, to support each other. The first years of marriage were almost perfect: joint projects, late nights in the library, excitement over the first salaries. But gradually, the illusion faded. Daniel became increasingly forgetful, missed deadlines, promised clients what the company could not deliver. Sophia had learned to read his schedule like a conductor, correcting every misstep so that the company wouldn’t suffer.

— Dan, tomorrow at ten you have a meeting with “TechConstruct,” — she would say in the evening, trying to keep fatigue out of her voice.

— Uh-huh, — he nodded, staring at his phone.

— They want to discuss discounts. I calculated: the maximum viable is seven percent. Anything more will be unprofitable.

— Uh-huh, seven, got it.

The next day, Daniel promised the client fifteen percent and full technical support the company didn’t have. Sophia found out from a bewildered sales manager. Her heart sank. She knew the consequences would fall on her, as always, but she stayed silent.

Martin Fischer, the company director, was a man in his mid-forties with sharp grey eyes and a habit of listening carefully. Unlike most bosses, he didn’t yell; he preferred dialogue and measured decisions. Sophia had worked for him for years and knew: when he furrowed his brow over papers, someone had overpromised.

— Sophia, — he called one morning, — do you have a minute?

She grabbed her notebook and entered his office. Martin was standing by the window, holding some papers.

— How long has your husband worked in sales? — he asked unexpectedly. Sophia’s chest tightened.

— Three years, Martin.

— And how much time do you spend fixing his mistakes?

She was silent. He turned to face her.

— I don’t want to put you in an awkward position. But the numbers speak for themselves. Last quarter, the sales department had the lowest results in two years. And eighty percent of client complaints concern one employee.

She knew exactly who he meant.

— Martin, I understand this looks unprofessional… — she began, but he gently interrupted:

— Sophia, you are the most valuable employee in the company. You know all the processes, remember every contract, communicate with clients flawlessly. Honestly, you handle responsibilities better than half the managers. Why are you still a secretary?

She looked at him and realized she could not lie. He could see right through people.

— When we started here, I wanted to try sales. But Daniel said having two competitors in one family isn’t right. He’d feel awkward if I earned more.

Martin nodded, as if he had expected this answer.

— I understand. I have a proposal. Consider a promotion. Head of Business Development. Double the salary, your own office, travel opportunities. Are you ready?

— And Daniel? — she asked quietly, heart racing.

— And what about Daniel? This is your career, Sophia. Your life.

That evening, she told Daniel about the offer. He listened, growing darker with every word.

— Head of Business Development? — he repeated. — So you’d earn more than me?

— Dan, this is amazing! We could finally afford a bigger apartment…

— What will people say? Your wife earning more than her husband?

— Who cares what people say?

— I care, — he snapped. — I won’t be a dependent.

— Daniel, what do you mean? We’re a family, a team…

— Team? — he scoffed. — In a team, everyone is equal. And you want to be the boss.

— I just want to grow!

— At my expense.

The conversation ended in an argument. Sophia declined the promotion. Relief mingled with pain: relief that she didn’t have to compromise herself; pain that her ambitions were limited by her husband’s pride and fear of change.

A month later, a new employee joined sales—Elena Moreau. Young, energetic, with a bright smile and experience in a major retail network. She had charm and charisma that caught the attention of the men in the office, including Daniel.

Sophia noticed changes immediately. Daniel stayed late, paid more attention to his appearance, started going to the gym.

— We have a new colleague, — he announced at dinner. — Very promising. Elena. She’ll help with major clients.

— That’s good, — she replied, though her heart clenched.

At first, she tried to focus on professionalism. Elena was talented, brought fresh ideas, and handled important projects. But Sophia saw how Daniel’s face lit up at Elena’s laughter, at her words. Her heart trembled with a sense of betrayal she refused to acknowledge.

One February evening, Daniel came home with a heavy expression.

— We need to talk, — he said, sitting across from her at the kitchen table.

He stayed silent for a long time, twisting a cold cup of tea in his hands. Sophia felt the end approaching, though she could not pinpoint what exactly was breaking her world.

— I’m leaving, — he finally said.

— Where? — she asked, though she already knew.

— From you. With Elena.

The world froze. Her voice sounded distant:

— How long?

— What do you mean “how long”?

— I mean… how long? — she repeated, trying to keep her voice even.

— Sophia, — she said quietly, — I thought we were… together.

— We are together, — he sneered bitterly. — But together doesn’t mean forever. I found someone who understands me. Elena. She… she takes care of me. I’m tired of being constantly corrected. I want to be with someone who doesn’t fix every step I take.

Sophia felt something inside snap. All those years of patient correction, of protecting him, of supporting him—all seemed gone. She sat, unsure whether to shout, beg, or simply close her eyes and accept it.

— When did you realize you wanted to leave? — she asked softly.

— I don’t know, — he admitted, looking down. — But I knew I couldn’t be myself with you. With Elena, I can.

Sophia was silent, gathering her thoughts. Bitterness mingled with fatigue and a quiet pride. She realized the years spent supporting Daniel had been her investment, which he had never valued.

The following days were torture. Daniel stayed late more often; Sophia came home to an empty kitchen, an empty room, an emptiness reflecting her own feelings. She tried not to show weakness, but tears came when she was alone. Work became her refuge. She left early, returned late, immersed in documents and tasks that were complex but honest.

It was then that Martin Fischer noticed her again. He saw her eyes regain focus, her strength return. He knew her talent exceeded the secretary role—she could manage entire projects, lead negotiations, achieve results long awaited from the sales department.

— Sophia, — he said one morning as the office buzzed with printers and phones, — we need to have a serious conversation.

She looked at him and saw respect, trust, and recognition of her value in his eyes.

— I know you have difficulties at home, — he continued carefully, — and I understand that it drains your energy. But I see your work, your dedication, and your competence. We should give you a chance. I am ready to offer you a promotion. Not as a secretary, but as Head of Business Development. Double the salary, your own office, a team, and decision-making power.

Sophia was silent. She thought of Daniel, of his rejection of her growth, of her desire to be more than a supporter. She realized she could no longer remain in the shadow of someone else’s ambition.

— I accept, — she said quietly, almost in a whisper.

From that moment, her life changed completely. Her days were filled with client meetings, department briefings, and strategic negotiations. Every day brought new challenges, but for the first time, she felt the thrill of real freedom and control over her own life.

Daniel watched from the sidelines. At first, he tried to interfere, make remarks, hint that she was changing. But gradually, his words lost their power. She no longer tolerated his sarcasm or criticism. She learned to say no, protect her boundaries, and demand respect.

Elena remained in sales, and Daniel stayed late with her. Sophia noticed but felt no pain. She understood that his choice was not her responsibility and that she deserved respect and love through her own dignity.

Months passed. Sophia became known in the company as a smart, decisive, and fair leader. Her projects generated profit, clients trusted her, colleagues respected her. Martin was by her side as a mentor and ally, and between them grew a closeness that eventually blossomed into tender feelings. They became partners not only in work but in life, though initially kept it private.

One evening, after a successful deal, Martin approached her at her desk:

— Sophia, — he said softly, — I want you to know: you are not just an invaluable employee. You are someone I want to walk beside. Not just in business, but in life.

Sophia looked at him and felt, for the first time in years, that her patience, perseverance, and ambition had been seen and appreciated.

— I knew, — she replied with a gentle smile, — that sooner or later, I had to choose myself.

And she chose.

Years later, Daniel left the company, still working in sales but without the success possible alongside Sophia. Elena moved to another city to build her career. Sophia and Martin developed the company together, traveled for business together, shared decisions and victories. Their relationship was built on respect, trust, and mutual support.

Sophia learned that no one could stop a person who decides to live for themselves, pursue their goals, and value themselves. She learned to forgive without forgetting, to understand that love is a daily choice—not control or dependence.

One day, Daniel accidentally walked into the office. He saw them together, confident and happy, and finally understood he had lost not just his wife but a strength he never possessed. Sophia met his gaze calmly, without anger, without resentment, with a slight smile:

— We both made our choices, — she said softly. — I chose myself.

Her world, once defined by order, discipline, and precision, had transformed into a world of freedom, strength, and true love no one could destroy.

Years later, Sophia became not just Head of Business Development but a top executive and partner in the company. Her professionalism was recognized industry-wide; her name became synonymous with success, integrity, and intelligence. Martin always remained by her side, supporting her.

Sophia sometimes remembered her years as a secretary, fixing her husband’s mistakes, restricted by someone else’s pride. She realized those years weren’t wasted—they forged her resilience, patience, and ability to understand people. True strength, she learned, lies not in controlling others but in mastering oneself.

And though Daniel was gone, she never felt regret. His departure was necessary for her to reveal herself and build the life she deserved. Elena faded from her world, leaving only the lesson that charm cannot replace talent and responsibility.

Sophia looked at her reflection in the glass of her new office, smiled, and thought: “My life is mine now. And I will never let anyone take it from me.”

It was true. She felt strength, freedom, and confidence in the future. The past was behind her, trials were over, and the future was open for new victories, feelings, and true happiness.

Sophia Reynolds had made her choice—and it was the right one.

Years passed, and Sophia Reynolds’ life became a testament to the power of self-determination. Her role as Head of Business Development evolved into that of Chief Strategy Officer, giving her influence over company-wide decisions and shaping the firm’s future. She traveled to conferences across Europe, negotiated high-stakes deals, and mentored younger colleagues who admired not only her skill but her unwavering integrity. Every challenge she faced strengthened her resolve; every achievement reminded her that her success was entirely her own.

Martin Fischer remained a constant presence, not just as a partner in the company but in life. They shared a quiet understanding, built on respect and mutual support. Their love was unhurried, rooted in trust rather than infatuation. Martin admired Sophia’s independence, while she appreciated his steadiness and thoughtfulness. Together, they navigated the complexities of a high-profile corporate world while carving out a private life full of laughter, shared passions, and long walks along the Seine in Paris or along the canals of Amsterdam.

One crisp autumn evening, Sophia was preparing for a board meeting when Martin approached her office, holding a small velvet box.

— Sophia, — he said softly, a gentle smile on his face, — we’ve built so much together—our company, our lives, our trust. I can’t imagine a future without you. Will you marry me?

Sophia felt a warmth spread through her chest. She realized that this moment was the culmination of every trial, every heartbreak, and every lesson she had endured. She smiled, a real, unguarded smile that reflected freedom, joy, and certainty.

— Yes, Martin, — she replied, her voice steady, — I choose you.

The wedding was intimate, held in a sunlit château in Provence, surrounded by colleagues who had become friends and family who had supported her journey. There was no sense of needing to prove anything; it was simply a celebration of two people who had grown together and chosen one another freely, without fear, expectation, or compromise.

Sophia continued to thrive professionally, earning recognition throughout Europe for her leadership and vision. Her former husband, Daniel, faded entirely from her life; he occasionally appeared in company gossip, but she never allowed resentment or pity to touch her. Instead, she focused on building, creating, and inspiring. Elena’s departure years ago had taught her a lesson she would never forget: superficial charm and ambition cannot replace discipline, intelligence, and integrity.

In the quiet moments, when Sophia looked out over the city from her office, she sometimes reflected on the journey from a young secretary, patiently correcting another’s mistakes, to a confident, empowered woman at the helm of her own life. She realized that every moment of suffering, every challenge, had forged her strength, her wisdom, and her compassion. She had learned that true happiness came not from dependence or control but from the courage to choose herself and her values every single day.

And so, Sophia Reynolds lived fully and deliberately. Her life was hers, unshakable and abundant, filled with love, respect, and achievement. She had finally learned the most important lesson of all: that freedom, self-respect, and love earned through mutual trust were the most enduring victories a person could claim.",1,1756918818.0,stories,1,1.0,False
1n7ke8r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7ke8r,Shot too Sour - Baratza Encore ESP + Flair 58+2,"Hello Reddit,

I’m new to espresso and just got my first machine yesterday. So far I’ve pulled around five shots.

Setup:
	•	Machine: Flair 58+2
	•	Grinder: Baratza Encore ESP

I can’t seem to get a longer shot—what I’ve pulled so far (see attached pic) is the best I’ve managed. The shots taste really sour.

What I’m doing now:
	•	Water heated to 200°F
	•	Preheating the Flair core on setting three (since it’s a light roasted bean)
	•	Grinder set to 3 on the Encore ESP (planning to try 1 later [have tried setting 8, 6, 5])
	•	Beans: lightly roasted
	•	Doses tried: 18 g and 20 g
	•	Using a distribution tool and a self-leveling tamper

From what I can tell, I think I’m under-extracting—the shots run too fast and that’s likely why they’re sour.

Questions:
	•	Should I grind finer (maybe down to 1 on the Encore ESP)?
	•	Would it help to try a higher dose, or should I focus more on shot time/ratio?
	•	Is 200°F the right temperature for light roasts, or should I go a little hotter?
	•	Any other tips for pulling a more balanced shot with this setup?

Any advice on dialing this in would be much appreciated!

I know I could have shouted, ignored, etc but I panicked and it is a lesson.  Also, this is the first time I truly felt lonely - besides this, I have felt good about the trip


I am in Florence and it has been really delightful, I ended up getting scammed outside of the Accademia (if you know you know).  As soon as I left the Accademia, a man started engaging with me and kept on asking for my whatsapp number, I said no I do not have a whatsapp because I am not giving a creep my number.  He kept on saying incredibly inappropriate crap and was saying to look at the paintings, I should have left but I freaked out and had engaged.  He was touching my arms saying he wanted coffee, he loved me, etc and I was unbearably uncomfortable but I was kind of frozen.

He then told me oh you need to pay me in cash for these - but I lied saying I had no cash hoping this would get him away but he was practically pushing me to an ATM to get €70, I tried to walk away lol but was t:/ and I felt like I was going to be sick so I just hoped if I give the money he will leave me alone.  He wanted to get coffee with me and I said I was sick so he said water instead?  I said I had some already, he kept on asking for WhatsApp and touching me - I wish I spoke up or shouted but again, I was in a freeze state hoping to just deescalate and leave asap.

He gave me those shitty prints and kept on bugging me to see him later for pizza, I told him no I am busy, he kept on going and I said no then left.  I threw the prints away, treated myself to a sorbetto and had a calzone.  Luckily I have a savings fund so I was able to reimburse myself of the money lost too without feeling any pain financially.

However, I do feel incredibly angry at myself for how I reacted but I was quite scared and was worried he may escalate or do something crazy so I tried to deescalate as much as I could.  I keep on telling myself my safety matters more than euro, but I am also annoyed.  Typically, I am good at ignoring and avoiding scams especially since I live close to London.  I am upset I froze but it was a lesson.  I wanted to just shout that out to the reddit void, I am still grateful to be in Florence, a dumbass shitty print seller will not take that from me even he took €70 and my will to live for the day.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Washington Nationals vs. Miami Marlins: A Tale of Two Tides (and One Very Tired Pitching Staff)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a mid-September snoozefest where the Washington Nationals (54-83) host the Miami Marlins (65-73) in a matchup so lopsided it makes a跷跷板 look balanced. Let’s break this down with the precision of a umpire who’s *finally* seen a clear strike.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Your Spreadsheet is More Confident Than These Teams**  
The Nationals, bless their underdog hearts, have a 41.2% win rate *as underdogs* (49-119). That’s like betting on a toaster to win a cooking contest—technically possible, but only if the judges are also toasters. Their 5.34 ERA is worse than your college GPA after a late-night all-you-can-eat sushi phase. The Marlins, meanwhile, are 45.5% when favored (10-12), which is basically the MLB version of flipping a coin while wearing a “I ♥ Chaos” shirt.

Key stat? James Wood, the Nationals’ human missile launcher, just tied for 21st in the majors with 27 home runs. That’s like being the 21st-best water balloon in a summer fight—still impressive, but not enough to win a war. On the flip side, Miami’s Eury Pérez (6-4, 4.04 ERA) is better than Mitchell Parker’s 5.94 ERA, which is worse than a leaky faucet in a hurricane.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and One Very Spasmy Outfielder**  
The Marlins are currently fielding a “Who’s Who of Misfortune.” Last game, star Jacob Young exited with back spasms, replaced by Robert Hassell III, who’s now the definition of “gimme” in fantasy leagues. Miami’s Adam Mazur, who allowed 10 hits in his last start, is now the baseball version of a participation trophy—present but ineffective.

The Nationals? They’ve got James Wood, who’s hitting home runs like he’s in a cornhole tournament. And let’s not forget Daylen Lile, the rookie who tripled his way into the hearts of fans (and possibly the Marlins’ frustration). Washington’s pitching staff, though, is about as reliable as a chair made of Jell-O. Their 1.433 WHIP means opponents are scoring like they’re on a caffeine IV.

**Humorous Spin: Because Baseball Needs More Laughs**  
The Nationals’ offense is so inconsistent, they’ve probably considered rebranding as the “Washington Nationals *Maybe*.” Their defense? A group of kindergarteners playing “Let’s Pretend We’re Fielders.” Meanwhile, the Marlins’ pitching staff is so exhausted, they’re probably rationing adrenaline packs like it’s 2020 and they’re surviving a pandemic.

Eury Pérez is the lone bright spot for Miami, but even he’s got the ERA of a guy who’s seen *one too many* late-inning meltdowns. As for Mitchell Parker? His 5.94 ERA makes him the baseball equivalent of a “Do Not Take Advice From This Person” T-shirt.

**Prediction: Why This Game Will End Before Your Microwave Popcorn Pops**  
Look, the numbers don’t lie. The Nationals’ offense is a flickering candle in a hurricane, but James Wood’s bat is hot enough to roast marshmallows. The Marlins’ pitching? A buffet for any hitter with a .200 average. Yet, Miami’s Eury Pérez has the ERA of a man who’s seen the future—and it’s a 2-0 loss.

**Final Verdict:** The Nationals win 4-3 in 10 innings because Daylen Lile triples again, and the Marlins’ relievers forget how to add 2+2. Miami’s fans will need a defibrillator, Washington’s fans will pour champagne into their coffee mugs, and we’ll all thank the sports gods that this season ends soon.

*Bet on Washington (-125) unless you enjoy watching teams make baseball look like a game of Russian roulette. The Marlins’ odds (+105) are basically a tax on hope.*

*Game on Wednesday, 1:05 PM ET. Stream it on Fubo, because nothing says “thrill” like paying $15 to watch a 5-94 ERA pitcher warm up.*

We don’t live together and only meet on the weekends or once during the week too (due to some circumstances I’m living with my parents). 
So when we meet we usually take turns paying so it ends up being 60/40. we never discussed this it just naturally happened. We never venmo each other or anything but it ends up being around 60/40. Yesterday for example, we went out for lunch and he paid for it (around $23). and then we went for desert and I paid ($12.5). - and he doesn’t offer to pay at all- he just allows me to. 
And then I was buying hand soap and he said he wanted some too and added it to my cart - it was $4 each. So yeah we take turns but i feel like it ends up being equal. 

When we go on small trips everything is pretty much split half way there too flights, hotels, etc. he does get some free food perks which i do benefit from and lounge access at airports. and he’s always excited to share those benefits with me. 

we don’t really buy each other gifts other than for valentine’s day and birthdays and we each spend around $100 equally. he doesn’t really get me flowers or gifts on occasion but i also don’t ask. He does give me snacks i like from time to time. 

I see friend couples and ppl on social media where the guy is spoiling the girl and the girl only pays for coffees or deserts here and there but the guy insists on paying majority of things - paying for trips etc

I know i shouldn’t compare but i can’t help it. I feel like im not being appreciated enough or i’m not worth being spoiled from time to time. 

I also asked how we would take care of finances once we’re married, and he said we would just pool both our incomes into one account and pay for things from there - so our money is our money. - i think this is fair.. and i wont feel like it’s 50/50

but am i being mistreated during the dating phase? I really love other aspects of him but I dont want this to be an issue in the future. He’s a great guy and he cooks for me sometimes (i can barely cook). he cleans and is very organized. in the future he would def be doing half of the cooking and cleaning. 

what are some things i can ask or test to see if he’s invested in me? what are things to observe, etc. am i wasting my time ?

1n7kbmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1n7kbmw/my_avoidant_ex_ended_things_abruptly_after_3/,My avoidant ex ended things abruptly after 3 years — looking for insight,"I (21M) was with my ex (23F) for almost 3 years. It was a very close relationship — we studied at the same university, traveled together around our country (+15 trips), spent most of the week at each other’s places, even built a strong bond with each other’s families.

Things changed when an old friend (with some romantic history) came back into her life. She wanted to prioritize that friendship, and for the first time, I felt like I wasn’t her priority anymore. We argued for weeks about it.

Eventually, she broke up with me face-to-face. I was shocked because I thought we were going to talk things through, but she ended it abruptly, with little explanation.

A few weeks later, we got back together, but she was emotionally distant from day one. Then came the second breakup — this time over the phone — where she said very hurtful things, like she was “tired” and “couldn’t give me what I needed.”. And also, that same day she uploaded an Instagram story with a photo of his ""friend"" because they were drinking coffee somewhere. Since there, I went full **no contact.**

Also, the last time I saw her was at my house, where we argued about her distance and lack of commitment. I remember that on that same day she said hurtful things to me and left me crying, without comfort. Then she went to meet up with a friend and I never saw her again. 

What hit me the hardest was what came after:

* Shortly after the breakup, she started seeing someone new (while I was still processing everything).
* Then she had a **jealous meltdown (while being with this person)**, texting me through WhatsApp and Instagram, and then calling me many times because I spoke with another girl. I only answered because she wouldn’t stop calling and I started to worry. 1 - 2 weeks later she sent a long apology text for her behavior — but it felt more about relieving her own guilt than about my pain.

Since then, I’ve gone full **no contact,** again.

She has anxiety and depression, a dismissive-avoidant attachment style, and a childhood where emotional support was denied — everything was externalized with gifts or material things, never true emotional connection.

Looking back, I see a pattern: she avoided emotional conflict at all costs. She ended things without closure, comfort, or empathy, and quickly moved on as if nothing happened, while I was left with confusion and pain.

I’m not looking to get back together, but I want to understand:

* Why someone can end things this way after so much love and closeness.
* Why can they seem so cold or detached while the other person is left shattered. This was too strange for me to take in, since during her depressive episodes or when we argued, I never left her crying or always tried to comfort her, even if it took a lot of time and effort. My conscience would not allow me to see her suffer like that.
* Will she ever grow up and apologize?

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you process it? The other day i saw her and her rebound, i took it well, but it still hurts.",1,1756918620.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

Scene: A long wooden table in a candle-lit hall. Plates of cheeseburgers, fries, pizza, and bottles of Coke and Dr. Pepper sit across the table - Klein pulled them from the Historical Void. The gods sit around, their divine aura dimmed so they can eat in peace.

Ancient Sun God (leaning back, voice heavy with memory):
“I still remember the glow of the city lights at night. Skyscrapers piercing the heavens, cars flooding the streets… even the noise was comforting, compared to the silence of eternity.”

Lilith (nodding, wistful):
“The warmth of coffee in the morning. The smell of rain on asphalt. I sometimes miss those little things more than the grandeur of thrones and sequences.”

Farbauti (gruff, quiet):
""Cold air biting your face, the world falling away, mountains like the bones of the earth… for a moment you are flying, freer than any throne of heaven. Just a man...snowboarding with his friends.""

Amansises (Evernight Goddess) (softly):
“Yes… and the endless night skies were different there. The stars were farther away, but somehow… more human.”

Roselle (leaning forward suddenly, with a grin):
“So, uh… did you guys have TikTok? I was kind of a big deal... Fifty thousand followers.”

(Everyone pauses. Ancient Sun God slowly blinks. Lilith raises an eyebrow. Farbauti stares in stone silence. Amansises exhales through her nose. Klein covers his face with his hand and lampoons inwardly.)

Klein (deadpan):
“Roselle, we’re reminiscing about humanity… not your thirst for attention.”

Roselle (ignoring him, waving a fry):
“No, but seriously, maybe you saw my account? I did historical reenactments - very educational. I had one where I dressed up as Napoleon and danced - ”

Amansises (shaking her head slowly):
“Your follies transcend worlds.”

Ancient Sun God (muttering):
“And yet, history remembers you.”

(The gods go back to quietly eating. The mood regains its gravity.)

Lilith (gazing at her cola):
“I miss the laughter of ordinary people. Friends gathering, unaware of destiny’s weight.”

Roselle (mouth full of pizza):
“Yeah, same. Also, I really miss Wi-Fi.”

(Everyone stares at him again. Farbauti finally sets down his drink, his deep voice rumbling across the table.)

Farbauti (flat, unimpressed):
""Of all things to mourn, you choose the internet. Typical Gen Z brat... Truly, the pantheon is blessed to dine with such depth of thought.”  

(Roselle sputters defensively, Klein laughs into his drink, Amansises hides a smile, and even the Ancient Sun God’s lips twitch. The nostalgia softens into shared laughter as the gods keep eating.)",2,1756918508.0,LordofTheMysteries,1,1.0,False

The braid is loose again. I tug at the end, but my fingers fumble, they always did when you weren’t there to nudge my elbow and say Slow down, silly. Your hands moved like whispers through my hair, weaving marigolds and something purple you’d plucked from the ditch behind our old school. ""See?"" you’d say, securing the stem with a rubber band smuggled from the maths teacher’s desk. ""Now you don’t look like an idiot."" I’d roll my eyes, but my chest would swell. You made crowns feel possible

I’m in Delhi now and here, Outside my window, traffic bleeds: a relentless, metallic herd. No ditches here. No marigolds choking the edges of football fields. Just concrete, and the smell of exhaust thick as guilt. I promised we’d meet before Ipa’s transfer tore me away. Now, I feel ashamed that I am safe here in Delhi, while many of you are still in Kangleipak. After the rains, we whispered under that tree, pinkies knotted. We’ll find that cave near Sekmai River. You laughed, ""Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks?"" Especially then, I said. Like the shared chowmein at Dingku’s stall, half-spicy for you, no onions for me. Like the way we’d press our thumbs together after tests. Honestly Henny, I never see us as different. What is a Kuki or a Meitei?

I still miss you a lot. The news of you, came, I think around Tuesday. Delhi’s air conditioning hummed like a trapped bee. Clashes intensify, the anchor said. Casualties reported in Churachandpur. I didn’t flinch. Casualties were shapes, not faces. Not your face, tilted back mid-laugh as you tried to balance on the monsoon-slicked wall behind school. Then Ima’s voice, tight as a wire: ""Henny’s gone."" No. The word was a stone in my throat. I swear it was a lie. Weren’t you with your relatives in Mizoram? Please say it is wrong. My cousin had shown me a blurry photo on the screen that he got from whatsapp, a boy’s body curled near a burnt-out jeep. Not yours, I thought. Definitely cannot be yours. Your smile was too bright for shadows.

I remember the last market day before I left. Your mother sold woven baskets near Ima Keithel. You tugged me through the crowd, past stalls smelling of dried fish and ginger. A Meitei vendor spat at your feet. You froze. I saw your knuckles whiten. Then you breathed out, slow as river mud. ""Uncle,"" you said, voice clear, ""My friend here loves your eromba. Extra maroi, yes?"" The man blinked. Nodded. As we walked away, you squeezed my hand. ""Hate is lazy,"" you murmured. ""Like copying homework."" I laughed, but you didn’t. Your eyes were old that day.

Now they tell stories. Meitei mobs burned Kuki homes. Kuki snipers picked off valley boys from the hills. They show videos: women naked, bleeding. Meitei? Kuki? The screen makes them all look like broken dolls. I vomited after the first one. Delhi debates ""ethnic tensions"" on primetime TV. Tribal land rights, they say. Scheduled Tribe status. Words like knives, sharpened far away in rooms smelling of coffee and power. Did you know, Henny? Did you care? Or did you just miss our algebra test that Tuesday?

My birthday cake had fifteen candles yesterday. Ima sang. Ipa clapped. I did not wish to celebrate without you. I closed my eyes, wishing for the cave’s damp darkness. For your elbow jabbing my ribs: Make a real wish! What wish is left? That Meitei mothers didn’t hide petrol bombs in rice sacks? That Kuki fathers didn’t teach sons to load rifles? That Delhi hadn’t directed Manipur to shut off the internet for 80 days so the world wouldn’t see you die.

New Delhi’s silence was indeed the cruelest magic. For weeks, no internet, no help: just more soldiers watching while Meiteis and Kukis slaughtered each other. Modi ji finally spoke when those videos of Kuki women paraded naked went viral. Shamed India, he said. But where was his shame when your people were killed? Or when Meitei boys were butchered in Tengnoupal? When places of worship were vandalised? I especially hate those in the mainland, in quest of their hegemony to make us northeastern's submit to them, they fueled us with lies: Meiteis yelling illegal immigrants! as if our ancestors did not live together under the glorious kingdom of Kangleipak.

Well Henny, if by any miracle you read this, I want to let you know. I found a marigold in Lodhi Garden. Woven into some bride’s photoshoot, probably. I stole it. Sat on a bench, trying to braid it into my hair. The petals tore. Strands tangled. A security guard eyed me. Crazy girl, his stare said. Let him stare. I want to weave our rebellion, Henny. One clumsy braid at a time. Against the lies that we were ever just Meitei or Kuki. Against the silence that thinks 258 bodies are a ""situation,"" not a screaming wound.

The flower falls. I let it go. Somewhere, the Sekmai still flows: carrying ash, carrying blood, carrying the weight of two friends. I’ll find it, Henny. Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks. Especially then.

Henny, you might have left me. You might have broken our childhood promise to grow up together, and to always be by each other’s side. In all honesty, I had a massive crush on you, and well I still do. But perhaps, maybe perhaps, our friendship was the biggest rebellion against the state. I am proud of that. However till then, I still ask:

Why did you leave me? The question claws inside. But the truth writhes uglier: *Why did our people choose hatred over children? Why did Delhi look away?*

That flower you gave me was more than beauty, Henny. It was a bridge. And I’ll wear its ghost until my hands remember how to build new ones.

Yours Truly,

Lychee as you used to call me

Granted, I’m as worldly and creative as a steamed carrot, so keep that in mind. The ambiance is nice, not loud at all, and the service was very good. Staff were attentive, but not overly so, and did well with our questions. Only nitpick is that the spacing between courses was a bit long between the last savory and first sweet course. With that out of the way, the food was sublime. Canapés were awesome plays on regular things we ate growing up: the dhokla was better than my grandma’s, the bhel was so unexpectedly cold and crisp with a smooth interior, and the pani puri (to me) wasn’t really a pani puri, but hey it slapped so who cares! The yogurt chaat tasted very familiar and traditional, but the textures were what made it new and fun for me. The scallop was great-tasting but not unlike scallops I’ve had at other nice places. The corn raab it was swimming in was shockingly good, I didn’t even know I liked corn like that. GET THE LOBSTER SUPPLEMENT. It’s lobster tail with Indian spices ever so nicely charred along the exterior - what’s not to like? The katli was a mousse which was a neat twist, and the lamb was divine. All perfectly cooked, with two cuts/preparations. All the savory courses had sauces that weren’t things we’ve ever done at home, so it definitely leapt the boundaries of what I would have considered to be traditional or normal. The main dessert had a chocolatey caramel balance that reminded me of the ice cream concoctions I made as a little kid, in the best way.

Today is my 24 hr prep day, I have only drank coffee and chicken broth thus far. My colonoscopy is scheduled for 9:30am tomorrow. 


I believe I need to take 4 Dulcolax tablets at 5pm today then at 6pm drink half of the solution ..lemon mix included (cold) ...and use the Zofran as needed for nausea. 


I see it says to drink an 8oz glass every 15 minutes, is it fine just trying to chug a bunch, then another chug to get it down. 


Then I believe the second portion of the liquid should be drunk 4.5 hours before the appointment so this would be at 5am tomorrow.

The braid is loose again. I tug at the end, but my fingers fumble, they always did when you weren’t there to nudge my elbow and say Slow down, silly. Your hands moved like whispers through my hair, weaving marigolds and something purple you’d plucked from the ditch behind our old school. ""See?"" you’d say, securing the stem with a rubber band smuggled from the maths teacher’s desk. ""Now you don’t look like an idiot."" I’d roll my eyes, but my chest would swell. You made crowns feel possible

I’m in Delhi now and here, Outside my window, traffic bleeds: a relentless, metallic herd. No ditches here. No marigolds choking the edges of football fields. Just concrete, and the smell of exhaust thick as guilt. I promised we’d meet before Ipa’s transfer tore me away. Now, I feel ashamed that I am safe here in Delhi, while many of you are still in Kangleipak. After the rains, we whispered under that tree, pinkies knotted. We’ll find that cave near Sekmai River. You laughed, ""Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks?"" Especially then, I said. Like the shared chowmein at Dingku’s stall, half-spicy for you, no onions for me. Like the way we’d press our thumbs together after tests. Honestly Henny, I never see us as different. What is a Kuki or a Meitei?

I still miss you a lot. The news of you, came, I think around Tuesday. Delhi’s air conditioning hummed like a trapped bee. Clashes intensify, the anchor said. Casualties reported in Churachandpur. I didn’t flinch. Casualties were shapes, not faces. Not your face, tilted back mid-laugh as you tried to balance on the monsoon-slicked wall behind school. Then Ima’s voice, tight as a wire: ""Henny’s gone."" No. The word was a stone in my throat. I swear it was a lie. Weren’t you with your relatives in Mizoram? Please say it is wrong. My cousin had shown me a blurry photo on the screen that he got from whatsapp, a boy’s body curled near a burnt-out jeep. Not yours, I thought. Definitely cannot be yours. Your smile was too bright for shadows.

I remember the last market day before I left. Your mother sold woven baskets near Ima Keithel. You tugged me through the crowd, past stalls smelling of dried fish and ginger. A Meitei vendor spat at your feet. You froze. I saw your knuckles whiten. Then you breathed out, slow as river mud. ""Uncle,"" you said, voice clear, ""My friend here loves your eromba. Extra maroi, yes?"" The man blinked. Nodded. As we walked away, you squeezed my hand. ""Hate is lazy,"" you murmured. ""Like copying homework."" I laughed, but you didn’t. Your eyes were old that day.

Now they tell stories. Meitei mobs burned Kuki homes. Kuki snipers picked off valley boys from the hills. They show videos: women naked, bleeding. Meitei? Kuki? The screen makes them all look like broken dolls. I vomited after the first one. Delhi debates ""ethnic tensions"" on primetime TV. Tribal land rights, they say. Scheduled Tribe status. Words like knives, sharpened far away in rooms smelling of coffee and power. Did you know, Henny? Did you care? Or did you just miss our algebra test that Tuesday?

My birthday cake had fifteen candles yesterday. Ima sang. Ipa clapped. I did not wish to celebrate without you. I closed my eyes, wishing for the cave’s damp darkness. For your elbow jabbing my ribs: Make a real wish! What wish is left? That Meitei mothers didn’t hide petrol bombs in rice sacks? That Kuki fathers didn’t teach sons to load rifles? That Delhi hadn’t directed Manipur to shut off the internet for 80 days so the world wouldn’t see you die.

New Delhi’s silence was indeed the cruelest magic. For weeks, no internet, no help: just more soldiers watching while Meiteis and Kukis slaughtered each other. Modi ji finally spoke when those videos of Kuki women paraded naked went viral. Shamed India, he said. But where was his shame when your people were killed? Or when Meitei boys were butchered in Tengnoupal? When places of worship were vandalised? I especially hate those in the mainland, in quest of their hegemony to make us northeastern's submit to them, they fueled us with lies: Meiteis yelling illegal immigrants! as if our ancestors did not live together under the glorious kingdom of Kangleipak.

Well Henny, if by any miracle you read this, I want to let you know. I found a marigold in Lodhi Garden. Woven into some bride’s photoshoot, probably. I stole it. Sat on a bench, trying to braid it into my hair. The petals tore. Strands tangled. A security guard eyed me. Crazy girl, his stare said. Let him stare. I want to weave our rebellion, Henny. One clumsy braid at a time. Against the lies that we were ever just Meitei or Kuki. Against the silence that thinks 258 bodies are a ""situation,"" not a screaming wound.

The flower falls. I let it go. Somewhere, the Sekmai still flows: carrying ash, carrying blood, carrying the weight of two friends. I’ll find it, Henny. Even if it’s just a crack in the rocks. Especially then.

Henny, you might have left me. You might have broken our childhood promise to grow up together, and to always be by each other’s side. In all honesty, I had a massive crush on you, and well I still do. But perhaps, maybe perhaps, our friendship was the biggest rebellion against the state. I am proud of that. However till then, I still ask:

Why did you leave me? The question claws inside. But the truth writhes uglier: *Why did our people choose hatred over children? Why did Delhi look away?*

That flower you gave me was more than beauty, Henny. It was a bridge. And I’ll wear its ghost until my hands remember how to build new ones.

Yours Truly,

Lychee as you used to call me

I have had no complications with my health since last October I had Scarlett fever which led me to have a horrible strep throat. I was treated with antibiotics. A month later I was diagnosed in the ER with costochondritis. In December, I started having horrible panic attacks that sent me to the ER 3 times. I would get brain fog and like tingly arms and legs before these attacks. My panic attacks stopped in April but I still get anxiety. I would think I’m 70% better however I still have these symptoms.

-Sudden mild adrenaline surges randomly(gut-drop feeling)

-fasting intolerance

-exercise intolerance (when I workout too hard even for a minute, I feel sick)

-medication sensitivity especially stimulants (I had to retrain myself to drink coffee which does not effect me that much anymore)

-neck sensitivity sometimes with swollen lymph notes (one at a time, not everyday)

-I still have costochondritis or chest pain. I would say it’s 85% better tho. Thank goodness. (Who even knows it’s costo at this point)

-lower BP at 96/80 when before I would be at 115/80.

-and now I might have an ulcer bc I can’t tolerate spicy foods but this could have been from anxiety medicine they put me on. (Unrelated but adding this just in case)

I have been to doctors and they label it as “anxiety”. None of the anxiety medicine they gave me helped my symptoms. I have taken BASIC blood work panels and it shows that I have higher inflammation markers. Yet no one addresses this. Of course, I asked chat. Chat told me it could be MCAS or something nervous system related. However, I have no rashes. And cardiologist ruled out POTS. I have an appointment with an endocrinologist and a gastroenterologist, has anyone had these past strep complications or could it be something else? Sorry for the long post, I am just really struggling still. Thank you.

EDIT: I just did a blood panel and my WBC lowered from last year and now is 5.10 10e3/mm3. Low AGAP. (8.9) High Bilirubin Total (1.30 mg/dL (High)) Low Platelet Count. (123). Stool tests came back negative for everything. ",1,1756917456.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

While I was nervous starting, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was most nervous about being nauseous after taking it, so I ate a 1/2 piece of sourdough toast with it each day and didn't get nauseous any of the days so far.  Did not affect my sleep either and I still drink coffee in the mornings. The side effect I did have was a mild headache (very unusual for me) most of the day on day 5. And pop definitely tasted flat (wanted to see for myself it that part was true and it was). Thankfully I don't drink much pop anymore since about a year and a half ago, but drank a ton of diet coke for over 25 years (I'm a 51 year old female). I lost 4.6 lbs. I'm 5'2"" and starting weight was 164 with a 38"" waist circumference. I've yo-yo-ed all of my adult life between the 140s-180s at the highest in 2020 (I was always a chubby child too). I've lost and gained so many times, but can never maintain after losing, and that is what I want long term. My main goals are to get my waist circumference to less than 1/2 my height in inches and get into the normal BMI range and stay there long term. I am also now following the Starch Solution meal guidance. Activity so far has been mostly walking, keeping active during the day getting steps in, avg 12k-15k a day. I want to start strength training soon at the gym again. I have been practicing stretching 2 times a day.  
 It seems like I felt full faster this past week mostly, but I was eating a lot more fiber foods than I had been leading up to this point. I do feel like the food noise was calming a bit too. I felt satisfied when I had one of a sweet baked good instead of wanting more and more. I'm curious to see what the 7.5mg dose does next. Hopefully side effects are minimal. Oh-I think constipation may be more of an issue, but I have been taking magnesium supplements for the last 2 1/2 yrs and that is still helping in that dept thankfully. Constipation and price are what made me not consider the GLP-1's (I'm not going thru insurance). :)",1,1756917286.0,QsymiaWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

I’m an international student in Utrecht, and this is my first year in the Netherlands. I don’t have a work permit yet (since an employer has to apply for it), but I really need to find a way to finance my living costs here.

I’m looking for jobs that don’t require a work permit, things like babysitting, dog walking, serving in a café, making coffee, etc. The problem is, I don’t know where to look for these kinds of opportunities.

If there are any NON-EU students here who have experience with this or know where to find such jobs, I would really appreciate your advice.

Should I talk to my doctor about getting my dosage increased? I really don’t want to increase unless I absolutely have to.

We're fortunate to have a dishwasher but very little cabinet space for storage and no separate pantry. The sink is in the corner and very hard to use/not large so it's not ideal for a household that loves to cook and a growing family that makes a lot of dishes. Right outside of the kitchen area is an open space that leads into our living and dining areas. We currently have it set up as a coffee station with majority of our mugs stored there. Opposite side of the oven and to the right of the sliding patio door is a wall with large windows, a singular island cabinet that does not serve much purpose but take up space and accumulate clutter.

My husband and I are debating closing up the windows on the wall to gain some additional vertical storage space and even maybe add a small dining nook our baby can use in the future. Does anyone have a similar layout or recommend changes to make the flow and space feel more efficient? Images below

\- Different payment methods



  
\- Tried guest checkout (lol that was desperate)



  
\- Deleted and re-downloaded the app





  
Just got off a 2.5 hour chat marathon with customer service. Got bounced between 4 different reps who basically said ""have you tried turning it off and on again?"" Rep #4 finally escalated it but said 24-48 hours for resolution.

1n7jelx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n7jelx,Blur Perfumes reviews,"Picked up Blur India perfumes from a sale. Had read good reviews so decided to do a blind buy. Yet another Indian brand that is venturing into perfumes, but the packaging is what stood out to me, along with the whole visuals around breakfast desserts (even though the whole edible thing is a little overdone). Plus they're affordable, all under 500. The box said these require maceration so I left them in the fridge for a day. Tried them on 2 days later and oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised. I went in expecting nothing from these perfumes because of their price points, but this turned out to be a good buy.

Crucial review points-
1. These are in 2 sizes, 50ml price at 799 and 30ml priced at 499. They also have a discovery set of all 5 at 399. So overall, in the extremely affordable category. 
2. These are all gourmand, sweet vanilla heavy scents.
3. The brand mentions these are freshly brewed, hence maceration is required. I kept them in the fridge for 24 hours, and then left them in my cupboard without their caps for a day or two.

Now coming down to the actual performance of the perfume-- I was thoughly impressed. I went into this with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. 

Vanilla melts- A mix of woody, vanilla and a hint of fruity notes, just hit the right spots. It's an absolute delight if you're into vanilla fragrances. It last 6 odd hours and is a perfect balance of sweet, musky and woody.

Cookie crumble took the cake for me. The mesh of florals and vanilla is subtle, yet impressive. I feel I have smelled this in some other fragrance, but can't recall Lasts pretty good, about 6+ hours on my skin. Opens very floral and sweet, simmers down to a soft woody, musky vanilla. Hands down, my favorite. I actually did not expect to like this one so much. Lasts longer than most floral perfumes I  have. And mind you, all those perfumes are atleast twice the price of these.

Coffee Cake- Smells exactly like Kamrah Qahwa. I have the OG so yeah, spot on dupe. Performs the best out of all 3. Lasted almost 9-10hours and there was a faint smell even after 10 hours!

Pros and cons:
Very affordable. Probably the best looking perfumes in the affordable category. Excellent projection. Good lasting on most variants.

Cons: Gourmand, sweet fragrances are a bit oversaturated in the market. 
I also didn't like the wooden caps. If it were a normal metal or high quality plastic would've been sturdier.

Overall my review would be 4/5 for the notes, 4/5 for the packaging, 4.5/5 for the projection and lasting on these. Surprisingly impressed and not complaining. I got the 30mls so very travel friendly and cute but they also have discovery sets on their website.",20,1756916606.0,IndianBeautyTalks,5,0.95,False

1n7jcy2,https://v.redd.it/4iu7m0pm6zmf1,MOVE IN ASAP – 3BR / 2BA Loft $1600 (Greenwood / Prospect Park),"One of our roommates dropped out last minute so we need to fill the room right away. The apartment is a renovated three bedroom two bathroom loft on 4th Ave in Greenwood Heights. Bedrooms are full sized with closets, high ceilings, and large windows that get good natural light. The common space is open with a real kitchen and updated appliances. Two bathrooms make it easy to share.

Rent is 1600 a month with heat and hot water included. Guarantors accepted.

The 36 Street D N R station is a block away. It’s about 20 minutes to Manhattan and a few stops down to Bay Ridge. Prospect Park is a short ride, Industry City is nearby for food and events, and Sunset Park is within walking distance. There are supermarkets like Key Food and C-Town close by, plus plenty of bodegas, coffee shops, and local spots along 4th and 5th Ave.

I need to know today. Move in available now.

The darkness when you get to work, and weaving slowly but deftly between fermenters with keen familiarity. Embracing the stillness and the silence, broken only by the hiss of the air compressor and the intermittent bubble of fermentation. The smell inside the patiently waiting kettle: clean stainless mingled with the crisp early morning air drifting in from the steam exhaust, a connection to the wild and a hint that fall is not long off. The richness of that first pot of cheap coffee. The first rays of sunlight through the overhead windows, turning the world pink and green and gray; and filtering in with it come my coworkers. My friends. My people. 

Sometimes the reasons I love this job are buried beneath the frustrations and the mundane and I need a reminder. Hope y’all are enjoying this lovely Wednesday and cheers 🍻 ",33,1756916495.0,TheBrewery,10,0.98,False

I have two male friends (both 24) that have some sort of interest in me and our friendships since have very much become a lack of personal space but nothing more than that. 

The first one (we’ll call him T) I’ve been in contact with all summer and he also just got out of a relationship back in March. We have a small group of friends within the bigger group that he and I are both apart of. That group hangs out all the time and we’ve hung out just us some. Neither one of us was really ready for a relationship and he graduates in December and will move away. We were never actually dating.

The second one (we’ll call him D) has been MIA since the end of the spring semester and we only just saw each other again last week. When he found out I’d broken up with my ex he asked me to coffee. I made it clear I was happy to but that I wasn’t looking for anything beyond friendship. He was cool with that. We went a couple days later and the whole thing ended up turning into a date halfway through. Neither one of us tried to make that happen it just did and I’m not mad about it.

The problem here is that because of my original intentions I didn’t think to mention T to D. Hours after he left that day I thought about the fact that I should’ve mentioned it as T and I have described whatever the hell we are as “not just friends but also not together”. Now I feel like I need to mention all of this to both of them and I feel awful for not mentioning it beforehand but I genuinely cannot tell if I truly did anything wrong. I also worry that if I bring it up now they’ll think I was trying to hide it, which I wasn’t, I just didn’t think about it. AITAH?",0,1756916415.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

I’m 24, she/her, bi, I live in Colorado with my nesting partner and I have one other local partner. I’m a huge dork, I work in tech, love books, writing, cartoons, memes, and cozy video games. I love conversations that never end.

I am looking for a person (or perhaps people) I could lay on the floor with all night talking to. I like to learn new things, ask questions, and get to know people.

I like weed, cocktails, and coffee. I love exploring museums, bookshops, and antique stores. I’m adhd with a tendency to find new hyperfixations all the time, I know a bunch of random things, and I’ve been told I’m funny. I start a lot of projects I never finish but I’m full of ideas.

I’m short, on the chubbier side but I’m cute. Longer brown hair, hazel eyes, bangs, round face. Happy to share pictures when I get comfy.

I’m more demi/sapio sexual, I want to get to know you. I don’t really think intimacy is much fun without strong connections.

1n7j956,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n7j956/aio_to_my_friend_disregarding_my_feelings/,AIO to my friend disregarding my feelings,"I (35f) have been friends with this guy (39m) for a very long time and I would consider us very good friends. We’re extremely close and I think most people who immediately know us would say they’re pretty much best friends. People are constantly commenting to me on how good of a friend I am to him or how highly he speaks of me. Just the depth of our friendship for context.

When you are so close to someone there is a possibility that feelings would arise. Nothing has ever happened between us but he flirts with me, lots of sexual innuendos, moments that didn't feel so friend like.  A lot of my friends who know the situation felt like he and I were operating as a couple but not acknowledging it. I did end of developing feelings but because I value our friendship and him as a person I tried to keep it to myself.

Well I’m staying with him and he did something that had me in my feelings. He realize something was wrong and kept asking me and after hours of him not accepting any excuse I said I ended up telling him I had feelings for him. He seemed surprised, comforted me in the moment, asked me about how i felt when I saw him with other girls. We further talked about it a couple hours later, he questioned our friendship and I assured him we are friends first and foremost. He asked me what are we going to do? I asked him what did he wanted to do. He said he thinks he wants to be friends. He thinks i’m amazing and loves me but he had never thought about us in a romantic sense but now that I brought it up he was processing that. I didn't buy that last part because I have receipts that say otherwise but I have to take what he said.

That sucked but I was going to process it and figure out how we move forward. I was thankfully that it didn't feel weird between us and that we could have a conversation with care and somewhat honesty. Then this morning he said he was going to meet a friend for coffee, asked if I wanted anything and he’d be back in an hour. He came back 5 minutes later with a girl in tow, went in his bedroom, turned on music for the next hour and half.  I did not expect this man to tiptop around my feelings forever but we had this conversation less than 48 hours ago. And to immediately turn around and do that in my face felt insensitive  and a total disregard to me, my feelings and our friendship In a big way.

It was a big deal for me to be so vulnerable and to have someone who claimed to be so worried about our friendship and my emotional well being choose to be insensitive like that when everything is so fresh makes me question if this person cares about me for real. This is not the first time I felt he disregarded my feelings but this felt different because he has all the information to know how that would make me feel and still did it. That just didn’t feel like something a friend would do. Am I over reacting?",1,1756916276.0,AmIOverreacting,11,1.0,False

34F, married no kids. Husband and I make ~130k each. So total household income ~ 260k. 

We have joint acct for household and shared things but everything else is separate. Works for us. 

I grew up with an immigrant mindset from my parents so have always been taught to be frugal no matter what. This is what has pushed me to make more money as well as save as much as I can. 

I have diversified a lot (rental condo, 401k, personal investment acct, Roth and traditional IRA, crypto, HYSA and HSA) and have amassed just under 700k in assets. I was hoping to make it to 1 million by 40. 

Recently received inheritance from grandparents helping me get to 1 million before 35. Am extremely grateful. 

I just don’t know what to do with that extra money to help me take things to another level. Part of me is very excited and grateful but the other part says it’s nothing because I know I’m not gonna change my lifestyle and blow it.I want to be thoughtful with what I do with it because I just feel it would make my ancestors proud. I don’t have kids right now and don’t have to worry about that. 

I guess my questions are, what should I do with this new chunk? How should I invest it? My current thoughts; get lasik, sell car and get an suv under 40k (used but new to me, never buying new and would pay off fully ), put 20k in the joint acct and then put some into HYSA and the rest into my investment acct? I want to start my own business at some point but idk if it’s worth it, i don’t know what I’d want the business to be. Id like to have a greenhouse coffee shop event space but even with the windfall I doubt I’d have enough capital and if it’s even worth it with rental prices and supply costs. 

 My thing was to save to FIRE early but now I don’t think I can not because of the numbers but because I will be bored and not know what to do in life outside of what I already do for work. This windfall helps me not have to worry about saving for retirement as much and I can finally enjoy what I have NOW instead of worrying about future constantly. 

So I guess what I’m wondering is a mix of how can I change my frugal mindset to let me allow nicer things but also how can I maximize the money I have now. ",0,1756916270.0,Fire,21,0.41,False
