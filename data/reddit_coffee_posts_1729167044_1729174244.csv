One of the most encouraging developments is an improvement in my circulation. It feels great to be more in tune with my body.

The brain fog that has lingered over the past few days is finally starting to lift. I find myself more alert and engaged. I’m also experiencing a heightened sensitivity to caffeine; no longer needing to consume half a pot to feel its effects. 

All that being said, the irritability I experienced last night was at an all-time high. I wasn’t going to cave, and never will, but had to take some deep breaths and remind myself it’s just part of the process. I managed to sleep it off, and after a couple small cravings and a large cup of coffee I feel refreshed and ready to tackle Day 4. 

Cheers to the journey ahead! 

P.s. I apologize for clogging up the sub with my daily updates, it just helps me keep track of my journey and share the experiences with all you great folks. There’s so much incredible information here. I hope you’re all going strong today 💪",1,1729174048.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

Next on the list is lowering my heart rate earlier in the night. Right now I’m at my lowest between 2-4AM. I have a consistent sleep schedule and read before bed. No caffeine except one cup of coffee around 7AM. My stress is high during the day.

If you’re like me, mornings are basically zombie time until caffeine kicks in, and this little machine is my lifesaver. Here’s why:

1. **Programmable Timer:** Imagine this: You set it up the night before, and boom—coffee is ready when you stumble out of bed. No more staring at the wall waiting for it to brew.
2. **Sneak-a-Cup Feature:** It’s 7 a.m., you’re running late, and waiting for the whole pot to finish just isn’t an option. This lets you pour a cup mid-brew without making a mess. Life. Saver.
3. **Brew Strength Selector:** Sometimes you want a mellow cup, sometimes you need rocket fuel. You get to pick your strength, so it’s perfect for households where everyone likes it a bit different.
4. **Easy Clean-Up:** The filter basket’s removable and dishwasher safe, which means no more painful scrubbing sessions. Trust me, it's a breeze.

Now, it’s not all sunshine—if you’re clumsy like me, filling the water tank can get a bit splashy because of the narrow opening, and I wish it had an auto shut-off. But those are tiny annoyances in exchange for waking up to fresh coffee every day.

Honestly, for the price, it's got most bases covered, and if you’re tired of manual coffee setups in the morning, it’s worth the investment.",1,1729173852.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False

He had been married before with Eliza, his best friend. They married at 18 and lasted 2 years and divorced. They remained best friend and when we started dating, Eliza; my husband's other best friend, Jack and my husband were a tight knit. Eliza was ""one of the bros"" and I always was ""the girlfriend"" and later ""the wife"" always an outsider, his two friends are single, so our house was always a place to crash. Even since we moved together they would show unannounced and do their own thing while I  made snacks and full meals. For the first yeard I tried my best to integrate into their clique but never worked out. It was always akward and I felt I was inserting myself where I didn't belonged so I stopped trying and relegate myself to be great host and let them do their things. 

I didn't notice at first but over the years resentment had build. I feel like a 50's house wife serving drinks and lighting cigarrettes to men. 

My husband on his own is amazing and love him. He had been a great partner and my bestfriend during this 14 years. Problem is I'm not his best friend, Eliza is. 

Every single thing that happens in our life had tl be discussed and annalized with Eliza. 

Early in our relationship I got pregnant, I took the test early in the night and we were really scared, despite this he was so reassuring with me holding me the whole night and told he was ready to do whatever I wanted to do. I said I needed to really think about it. Next day we went to our classes and agreed to lunch together. 
When we met, he asked me how I was and all, then told he had the contact of a doctor who did abortions (it was illegal back then) I asked how he found one so fast when wasnt sure what to do. Answer: he called Eliza early in the morning and she had a friend. I felt so betrayed because this was something that belonged to me and he went and shared it with someone else, ""not just  someone else is Elizs, come on!"", he said. 

During the next days everytime I saw him he has new information from Eliza and Eliza's friend. I was so confused and scared, and Eliza convinced my boyfriend we needed to it fast because it would be easier. It was so much pressure I agreed long story short it was a rat hole doctor office and I almost died there. 

To this day I don't know if I should had kept the baby or no. But better not think about it. 

When my boyfriend propossed Eliza was ""fake mad"" he didn't said first to her he was going to propose to me. The only way to placate her was to has her as a best man, despite my husband having a male best friend. 

Every little or major event in our life turns into ""yeah, I'm gonna tell now Eliza you know how she gets"" 


Something _bad_ happened to me as a child and I told this to my husband, he was the first person I talked about it. Months later Eliza and I were alone in out kitchen and she started to talk about something she heear in the news about something bad happening to a little girl and then hugged me. 

When I started to try for a child and I got pregnant  I asked my husband to kept this for us for a little. It was wednesday, sunday when I saw Eliza she congratulated me. I ended up miscarrying. 

I started to look for a doctor to help me deal with my depression, again, something I wanted to keep to myself. Eliza was so understanding. 

When I was pregnant with my daughter, Eliza came full of advice on things I should do. I told her to mind her own bussines wich really hurt her feelings. I stood on my ground and told my husband I wasn't going to raise my kid with Eliza and didn't wanted to hear any advice from her. 

This was a big fight with my husband becaude I was rude and Eliza was family and already considered herself and auntie. This had been the only time I had given an ultimatum to my husband ""Eliza better keep herself away from my motherhood or will leave"" 

Now resentment has reached a point when I don't want her near me or my house or my husband. 

I feel she is more married to my husband than I. 

My whole life feels like I live best friends to lover drama. 

I'm not sure why I'm writings this. Probably because I'm alone in a coffee shop and thinking I want my husband to be my husband and not feel like a lame love interest in someone else epic love story. 

In the past my husband thought I was being childish. Despite loving him I cant keep to be married like this. I dont feel I can trust to talk to him again without involving Eliza, I don't want to hold an ultimatums.

Well, the Breville Precision Brewer Thermal Coffee Maker might just be the endgame. This machine has blown my mind—and my taste buds—with its customizable brew modes and a thermal carafe that keeps the good stuff hot for hours. Say goodbye to sad, lukewarm coffee. ☕

**Build Quality and User Experience**  
Right out of the box, you feel the quality. It's got that sleek stainless steel look that fits in any kitchen, but more importantly, it's built solid. The LCD screen is easy to read, and the buttons make a satisfying click—you know, the kind that makes you feel like you're in control of your caffeine destiny. Switching between modes like Gold, Strong, and Cold Brew is super easy. No PhD required here, just good coffee when you want it.

**What Sets It Apart**  
What I love most are the six preset modes. There's something for everyone—whether you're in a hurry (Fast mode!) or want to experiment (My Brew lets you tweak bloom time, temperature, etc.). And yes, the KEYWORD feature is the thermal carafe that doesn’t let your coffee get all bitter and gross like those glass carafes on a hot plate. Imagine leaving your coffee for hours and it still tastes amazing—that’s life with this machine.

**Performance That Delivers**  
Need a full pot in a flash? Fast mode does it in under 7 minutes, and it still tastes awesome. The customization lets you dial in everything to suit your exact taste. I’ve played around with bloom times and flow rates, and honestly, it’s like I have my own mini café at home. For a coffee nerd like me, this is heaven.

**Cons? Yeah, There Are a Few**  
Alright, so it’s big—like, you might need to rearrange your counter big. Also, the settings might overwhelm beginners. My friend who’s not into coffee as much as I am found it tricky at first. Plus, the price? It’s on the higher end at around $300. But if you take your coffee seriously, this is more of an investment than a splurge.

If you’re tired of boring, mediocre coffee and want something that’ll seriously elevate your brew game, the Breville Precision Brewer is worth every penny. Customizable, built to last, and makes coffee that’s damn good—what more can you ask for?",1,1729173792.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I love berry colors on me, ranging from extremely subtle to somewhat loud. Example: my most subtle is maybe Bobbi Brown's Bare Raspberry, and my most loud is Chanel's Phénomène.

However, because I have so many berry colors, I would like to branch out to more neutral colors. But there are a lot of issues:

* It MUST be cool-toned
* It cannot be brown or brick. I don't want 90s vibes.
* It cannot have ANY orange or coral whatsoever. My lip pH will turn even normally cool lip colors to orange or coral as time passes, so if this can be avoided that would be great
* Must be desaturated

This may narrow down my options significantly, but let me tell you some colors that worked so we can all understand what I'm after:

* Pink Cashmere by Flower Knows - the brand describes this ""pink mist"", ""cold-mixed pink milk coffee"", ""pinkish latte"", and ""cold toned oolong latte, low saturated shades for winter"". Here is why I think it works - even though when I swatch this it looks brown, it's not like that in person. Honestly, it feels like a mix of pink and grey, with some very subtle but natural brown mixed in a tiny bit. I think the pink and grey combo is what allows it to work.
* Red Bean Buttermilk by Flower Knows - so this is from the same line as above, and while it is way more red, I think it works because its like a red and grey combo, rather than red and brown (which helps it avoid looking brick colored). However, I have to apply this lightly
* Black honey - so this is a bit more berry colored in general, but it is subtle and something natural like this but more grey/tan could be kinda what I'm looking for",1,1729173783.0,PaleMUA,0,1.0,False

For context: I'm an amateur digital artist who's been crypto-curious for a while. After months of hesitation, I decided to mint one of my pieces. How hard could it be, right? Oh, sweet summer child...

The saga:

1. Chose a piece I was proud of (a digital painting of my neighbor's grumpy cat)
2. Selected a platform (went with OpenSea because it seemed user-friendly)
3. Set up my MetaMask wallet (only took 3 tries and 1 minor panic attack)
4. Attempted to mint... and promptly got confused by gas fees
5. Waited for lower gas fees (is 3 AM always the best time?)
6. Finally minted! ...and then realized I had no idea how to price it

The whole process took about 6 hours, 2 energy drinks, and one existential crisis about the nature of digital ownership.

But you know what? Despite the stress, it felt amazing to see my art become an NFT. It's like... I'm part of the future now?

Any other first-time minters out there? How was your experience? And uh... any tips on how to actually sell this thing now that I've minted it? 😅

Have had multiple hip surgeries in the past, not sure if it’s relevant.

Currently taking a daily multivitamin and Ibuprofen

I’ve lost 70 pounds in the last 12-13 months, and my weight is still slowly decreasing. In this time period, I have not done anything excessive to lose weight or even necessarily try to lose the weight. I stopped buying soda, late night snacking, and drinking high sugar drinks. I mostly drink water, sometimes with a lemon, and usually have one cup of black coffee in the morning.

I don’t really exercise intensively because it’s been painful for my hip/arthritis. I go on a neighborhood walk a few times a week though.

I don’t restrict foods and generally eat what I want within moderation. I am incredibly picky though and have a limited selection of foods I can eat. This part is probably Autism related, but it’s been this way my whole life.

I had a physical last month and all my fasting labs came out “perfect”, in her words. My PCP tested for: General chemistry, lipids, A1C, CBC, Thyroid, and Hepatitis. Happy to share values if it’s necessary. PCP did not seem concerned about weight loss though, and the rest of my physical was fine.

I guess I’m just wondering if this amount of weight loss is “normal” Going from 200 to 130 pounds has been a little jarring, especially when I haven’t been actively trying to lose the weight. I will say that my hip/arthritis on the hip does feel better with some weight off of it though!",2,1729173276.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I know this question has been asked before, but the last post I've seen was quite sometime ago, so I believe there have been more updates. The specific questions I want answered are:

  
1. What is a good general team template?

  
2. What are the best Pokemon for each area/dish type?

  
3. What is the best Pokemon for each ingredient (updated with coffee)?

  
4. What is the best Pokemon for each berry?

  
5. How would one go about rating their own Pokemon (Ingredients, Sub Skills, Nature, etc.)?

At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. 

When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she made him a full breakfast with a cup of steaming coffee. 

As she was pouring the coffee, he noticed a $5 bill sticking out from under the cup’s bottom edge. “All this is just too wonderful for words,” he said, “but what’s the money for?” 

“Well,” she said, “last night I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you and he said, ‘Fuck him, give him a fiver.’”

It’s been a crazy ride so far, as I am a dental student that was living off snacks & 200 mg energy drinks for the longest time. Here is what I am eating as a “relaxed” carnivore. I am eating all fatty meats, eggs, butter, hard cheese, very little dairy, plain yogurt sometimes. I still do have avocados and black coffee (kill me, i know!) 

Here’s the issue (there may not be one), but I am doing a progress test on Saturday for Hyrox, if anybody is familiar with it. Essentially, hyrox is a fitness competition for all different levels, ages, experience. My gym is holding a hyrox PFT (physical fitness test) to put us into qualifying groups. I’m currently on carnivore, with no carbs for fuel. My cardio has for sure lacked since being on carnivore, as I feel actually heavier on my joints and tired so far. 

What do you recommend I eat/drink before the competition? It’s currently Wednesday, so I have a few days to maybe slowly introduce a food group into my diet for Saturday. Maybe bananas or something. I’m worried that I will have no energy for this competition and I’d like to perform well. ",1,1729172759.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

I had been thrown into a kiln, just as I requested when we first got the diagnosis, but my sister was more than adamant I “needed” a real celebration, coincidentally one hosted by the pastor she had been crushing on since her last divorce. Like I feared, “my” party was just a battleground to reopen old petty wounds and an excuse to have yet another family feast. 

Although I didn’t get any cake, I was forced to watch from……somewhere.

Regardless, all that drama had blown over and I was on the mantle inside my dream house I had paid for with my chosen career alongside the woman made for me. My sister had always mocked my meticulously designing but it had all paid off.

“We’reeeere here!”

Thanksgiving was usually a quiet affair with my beloved, my darling daughter and her great husband and well-behaved children. However, this year, the guest list had expanded, to my wife’s shock. After chastising my wife for failing to honor me, my sister ordered a banquet of Chinese food. Since she hadn’t brought cash, the buffet was paid for with the credit card we barely used. 

“Woah,” I wobbled. I had feared my niece’s Large Sons were getting too close with their physical bickering but I figured even they had the couth to not knock over the fragile resting place of a relative. I was wrong. 

“Git up,” my sister elected to pay attention after the mess had been made.

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

I’m 20 F spending a semester abroad in London. I’m finishing up a quick trip to Lisbon, where I met this guy (18 M) on a ferry. 

We chatted for a bit and then I asked for help with directions. I’m glad I spoke with him because it turns out I was completely wrong about how to get to my destination and would’ve been in deep trouble! He was meeting someone at the stop I was getting off at, so he told his friend to wait while he guided me to where I needed to go. 

Not only did he show me the bus stop and a restaurant recommendation, he spoke with the people at the booth and the bus driver to ensure that I had the right direction and ticket for where I was going. When getting on the bus, he thought I didn’t have euros and they only took transit cards and cash, so he tried paying for me. He even waited until the bus drove off!

Unfortunately, today is my last day in Lisbon. I would’ve loved to invite him for coffee and get to know him more. I did get his instagram and he followed me back. 

Basically, I’m asking for advice on how to start kindling a possible relationship/fling with him. I’m definitely coming back to Lisbon sometime in the very near future (I’m in love with the city), but I think he’s absolutely gorgeous and kind. What steps should I take to make this happen? Do I send him a thank you message? What should it even say? I’m really nervous, I’d love some advice.

Starting a quick renovation and redecoration on a tight budget with a view to updating the decor (home was built in the 1960's and the decor/carpets/etc looks dated from the 1980's).

The living room is not on the ground floor, and visitors to the home have to climb 8 dark cherry wood stairs to get to it. This is the UK, so it can be dark and overcast outside half the time. The living room is also fairly small (14'x12').

1. Considering replacing the existing dirty green and off white carpets with hardwood floors? Thoughts on if this is a good idea, and if so, what might a good wood colour be?

* Replacing the cherry wood staircase is not in plan, so hardwood needs to blend harmoniously with it. However, am concerned that a darker wood will not look good in a living room, especially when the outside is dark and overcast too.
* Will replace the carpets in the bedroom too, ideally the same wood colour will work there as well.

1. Given the small room size, considering replacing the radiator with underfloor heating. Alternatively, replace the radiator with a modern and sleek looking designer one. Curious to hear suggestions.
2. When repainting walls, what colour would work best for the room type and floor colour? The current (ikea) coffee table and bookshelf / tv table in the room are all a brilliant white. The large mirror (which helps make the room look larger) has a dark wood frame, but all of the furniture can be replaced over time of course.
3. Can have a custom cover made in any colour for the sofa/chaise. Given the current (ikea) furniture is all in white, what colour would work best for the couch?",1,1729171720.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

1. My favourite cup that I use every day and really the only cup I liked having my coffee in because it was bigger than a regular cup but also not too big. He says it fell out of the cupboard, but I rarely have it in the cupboard, I tend to just rinse/wash it when it’s done and put it on the drain rack for next time

2. One of the communal chargers that I bought for every room in the house. We both have iPhones and I was sick of him leaving his charger at work and asking to borrow mine, so I bought USB plugs and chargers for every room, and the living room charger has been yanked out of the wall and the USB has snapped. Again, he claims accident.

3. My toothbrush. The idea of someone touching my toothbrush repulses me, so I make sure it’s out of reach on the far side of the shelf in the bathroom, tucked away in the corner. Somehow it’s ended up on the floor and won’t turn on. Great.

4. My white washing is now all pink. We do communal clothes washing and we have seperate baskets for whites/colours, and somehow his red t shirt has ended up in there on his week to do washing.

I feel like I’m losing my mind. Am I overreacting? He’s been an almost ideal roomate for years, never had any problems like this. We’ve not had any spats or fallouts or arguments, we’re like best friends normally, but how can all of this happen in 3 days?

I’ve not said anything about it, other than just asking him to be more careful in future. I know accidents happen, I’m a very care free person but I wouldn’t dream of touching other people’s belongings because I believe in treating people how you want to be treated, same goes for their things.

# Chapter Three

  

How many times had I dreamed of this moment? How many nights had I imagined walking down the aisle, the love of my life waiting for me at the altar?

Everything was perfect. Almost everything. Except for the man standing at the end of that aisle, the man I was supposed to marry. The man whose eyes were filled with cold indifference instead of love. My heart ached, and I blinked back the tears threatening to spill, refusing to let them make a scene.

The ceremony was a blur, a haze of vows and traditions I barely registered. My thoughts were consumed with dread as I realized what awaited me — a home where I'd be alone with him, a man who clearly didn’t want me.

During the car ride back, Sorin sat as far away from me as the backseat allowed, his gaze fixed outside the window, his silence as heavy as the tension between us. I wanted to say something, anything to break the ice, but the fear of irritating him kept my lips sealed. I couldn’t help but glance at him, at his strong profile, every feature so painfully familiar from the countless times I'd admired him from afar.

“Quit staring. It's irritating.” His voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. He cast me a brief glance, the look in his eyes sharper than his words.

“Sorry,” I whispered, my cheeks burning as I quickly looked away.

When we arrived at his house — no, his mansion — it felt like stepping into a dream, or rather, a nightmare. The place was as grand as one could imagine, but it held no warmth for me. It wasn’t a home; it was a gilded cage.

I followed him inside in silence, my stomach in knots as he led me to our bedroom. ""Our"" bedroom. I hadn’t expected that. Seeing the surprise on my face, he rolled his eyes and sighed. “My parents locked the other rooms. Apparently, they’re adamant that we sleep in the same one.”

Embarrassment washed over me. His parents clearly had hopes for this union that didn’t align with reality. He gestured towards the couch. “You’ll sleep there.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As I approached the couch, I noticed a pillow and blanket already laid out, a silent but clear arrangement. I sank into the cushions, trying to make myself comfortable.

""Wait."" His sudden command startled me. I turned, finding him pinching the bridge of his nose, visibly conflicted.

He sighed heavily. “Never mind.”

Confused, I resumed my place on the couch. But before I could relax, he spoke again. “No, wait.” He looked exasperated, as if warring with himself. “You can... share the bed. If you’re comfortable.” 

I hesitated, my eyes drifting to the bed. It was large enough for both of us, but sharing it felt too intimate, too overwhelming. Still, the couch wasn’t exactly inviting either.

“Are you sure?” I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded stiffly. “Yes.”

Taking a deep breath, I got up and slowly made my way to the bed. He laid down on one side, and I settled on the other, making sure to keep as much distance as possible. My back was to him, and I prayed that sleep would come quickly, though I doubted it would.

Just as I was starting to relax, I heard the sound of pillows being moved. I glanced over my shoulder to see him placing a row of pillows between us.

“I hope you don’t kick in your sleep,” he muttered, his tone dry.

Heat rushed to my face. ""I don’t think I do,"" I mumbled, though I wasn’t entirely sure.

The night passed in tense silence, but at some point, I must have drifted off. A sudden groan woke me, and I blinked groggily, trying to figure out what had happened. My heart sank when I realized that, in my sleep, I had somehow managed to kick Sorin in the chest.

“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” I gasped, covering my mouth in horror.

He glared at me, jaw clenched, clearly in pain. He shoved my leg back over to my side of the bed and got up without a word, heading straight for the bathroom.

“I’m sorry,” I called out again, desperate for some form of forgiveness. “Does it hurt a lot?”

He ignored me, his face a mask of irritation as he disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. A tear slid down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Crying wouldn’t help. Nothing would.

I decided to make breakfast, hoping maybe it would soften the edges between us. By the time I finished, I heard him coming down the stairs, impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit. He looked just as handsome as ever, but he walked past the kitchen without a glance in my direction.

“Um… breakfast?” I stammered, trying to gather the courage to speak.

He paused for a fraction of a second, then continued walking toward the front door. Without so much as a word, he left, slamming the door behind him.

I stared at the untouched plates in front of me, my heart sinking further. I sat down at the table and forced myself to eat, though every bite tasted like ash. The lump in my throat grew with each passing second as the reality of my situation settled in.

Sorin would never love me. I was nothing more than an inconvenience to him, a burden he’d been forced to bear. My heart longed for something, someone to care about me, but all I had was emptiness.

Tears welled up again, but this time, I didn’t bother to fight them back. No one would see. No one cared.

I just wanted to be loved.

My mother has been on hospice for incurable ovarian cancer, for two weeks now. Me, my sister, and my mom’s siblings have all been taking turns coming to the house and taking care of her and my father (who has dementia). My sister and I both live 1500 miles away, and her siblings live far too. Now that my sister will be completing her visit soon, we will have “cycled” through visits. My mom is currently still mobile and lucid, though her pain is increasing quickly. She’s still able to do things like make my dad coffee, and insists she doesn’t need 24/7 care.

But…how will anyone know when she does, if she’s only getting 2 nurse visits and 1 social work visit a week?

As her POA, I know in my heart I should be out there, taking care of her until her final transition. The plan is to come back once she’s bed bound..but again, I feel like even though she doesn’t need it yet, there should be someone there all the time.
My biggest problems with going out now, and possibly spending months being my mother’s caretaker-I have a preschooler at home, and I’m an independent contractor so I don’t qualify for any FMLA or anything.  I don’t have any savings, thankfully hospice is all out of pocket for my mom.

What would you do??? Do you think my mom should have someone there all the time, or is it ok if we wait until she’s bed bound? Would it traumatize my daughter to be away from me for possibly months (barring a few brief visits), or would be more traumatizing to me to not take care of my mom now????

1g5qrk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1g5qrk9/how_tim_ferriss_came_up_with_the_4hour_work_week/,How Tim Ferriss Came Up With The 4-Hour Work Week (using Google Ads),"The original title of the semi-autobiographical self-help book **""The 4-Hour Work Week""** was **""Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit.""**

Tim Ferriss liked the title because it polarized opinion but Walmart disapproved it for obvious reasons.

So Tim Ferriss went back to the drawing board and came up with 12 different title names but everyone had an opinion on the best title, including his agent and distributor but none of them could agree on 1 final name.

Instead of relying on gut feeling, Tim took a data-driven decision.

### 1. A/B Testing Title using Google Ads

Tim Ferriss took 6 prospective titles that everyone could live with: including ""Broadband and White Sand"", ""Millionaire Chameleon"" and ""The 4-Hour Work Week"" and developed an Google Adwords campaign for each.

He bid on keywords related to the book's content including **""401k""**, **""world travel""**, **""retirement""**, and **""language learning""**

He was looking for keywords related to lifestyle design, productivity, retirement, travel, and learning new languages as the book covered those concepts.

So if someone searched for keywords like **""401k""**, they would see the 6 rotating titles without bias on the most-clicked one.

The potential titles appeared as headlines in sponsored results and ad text was the subtitle. The URL led to an under-construction page with email.

Here's how the campaign must have been:

https://www.youtube .com/watch?v=P3L9IDEKRp8 (remove space)

Tim Ferriss was interested to see which of the sponsored links would be clicked on the most as he knew that he needed his title to compete with over 200k books published in the US each year.

At the end of the week, he knew that ""The 4-Hour Workweek"" had the best click-through rate by far and he went with that title.

And he managed to do it for less than $200.

This is minimal viable marketing.

### 2. A/B Testing Placement IRL

Tim Ferriss didn't stop his experimentation there.

He decided to test various covers by printing variations of them on high quality paper.

He placed the covers on similar sized books in the new non-fiction rack at Borders Bookstore in Palo Alto.

He sat with a coffee and observed visitors to learn which cover was the most appealing one.

He did this to observe pick up rates while pretending to read.

He found the best placement to be just below eye level, left side of the new non-fiction rack.

This small experiment made **""The 4-Hour Workweek""** an instant best-seller that sold over 2.1 million copies, stayed on The New York Times Best Seller List for 4 years and got translated into 40 languages.

You can use this technique to test your SaaS Value Proposition using Google Ads.

people overcomplicate google ads for saas

i've spent thousands on google search ads creating signups for my companies and friends

here's my formula:

find bottom-of-funnel keywords related to your product

create ads bidding on those keywords

include the exact keyword in the ad copy for a higher click-through rate

ensure the keyword is in the h1 title of the landing page for a cohesive user journey

set up a conversion event in google tag manager to track signups and send data back to google ads

only bid on keywords that drive conversions

that's how to run google ads for your software company

What do you think? Have you used such technique to validate your SaaS or drive conversions?

Does 5g of fiber really help? Should I take more than 2 gummies every day? My dr was fine w me using miralax, but I don't want to overdo it either. For the record i'm also trying to up my veggie/fruit intake as well. 
Thanks for any advice and guidance. Hope you all are doing well on your journeys too ❤️",1,1729171339.0,Zepbound,5,1.0,False

After an afternoon of copy-paste I listed as many Pokemon-recipe combinations that I could identify. It's still possible that I had missed one, not all of them had identifiable Pokémon, and 2 videos were missing, but it's most likely human error. Feel free to share what how I may have messed up. Furthermore feel free to share what Pokémon- recipe combination you'd like to see. Finally, please share what recipe you'd think work best for a Parasect. I was thinking something that uses insects, and mushrooms would work, but I couldn't find an ancient recipe. If you have one on hand, let me know. thank you.

October OPEX is almost here! And it looks like Bank of America didn't explode. What does this mean for our Stonk? Let's find out! 

**Price Movement Recap**

Another day, another wick on our daily candle popping up to the 50-day SMA resistance line - that's three in a row now. 

[10\/16 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/hnv1q4qd4bvd1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=edefe1b8234ac8983e05c1297dd66ac0b9d74653)

Although total volume off the open simmered like a yankee pot roast - low and slow - options volume was steady and bullish on calls all morning, driving the price up gradually as traders took confidence in our extremely stable net positive gamma structure. Intraday price action initially walked the price up and off our VWAP +1Σ resistance line and VWAP itself before the confirmation of our upward trend shifted sentiment toward oscillating mini-reversals off the 50-min SMA. By 11:30am, the last push up to $21.60 saw Bullish Call sentiment dissipate and the price settle back down into a sideways gamma pin right around VWAP.

Excitement late in the day looks to have potentially been a response to a sizable dark pool order - or potentially that the dark pool order coincided with some other factor in addition to an uptick in bullish options volume. In any case, from about 3:05pm, the stock price mounted the overlap of the 50-min and 200-min SMA and pumped up to $21.75 for a new high on the week - and within $0.01 once again of our 50-day SMA. Options premiums finished the day decidedly skewed toward bullish sentiment.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Our OI changes are notable enough to raise an eyebrow this morning. Max Pain remains stable at $20, but our OPEX OI has shifted at some of our key strikes that curiously does not line up with the volume data. One wonders exactly what was going on here. I'll show you what I mean:

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/16-10\/17](https://preview.redd.it/09pdwwia6bvd1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d4c923d054bcb2601cdba521c62146a0da83fe)

As we can see we had a lot of retractions as traders bought and sold to close during yesterday's trading. Our Put contractions look normal in relation to the type of move we saw yesterday, as did the expansion of Call OI at $22 and above our trading range. However, there was a large contraction in Call OI yesterday at $21 and especially $20 by what we have to assume was bi-sentimental. At $21 the story is pretty clear:

https://preview.redd.it/x5c6jzdr6bvd1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c515107d9cb47e544cabfe3302eddc3c48e074

The volume was pretty steady throughout the day and the 3507 closed contracts fit within yesterday's reported volume. Most of the closed OI appears to be from a single large trade early in the day from a trader holding long calls who took profits early. The story is not so clear at $20:

https://preview.redd.it/06jrrg2f7bvd1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=ade52f16284fe526cc506e5f94078b5c7e7cd9d3

OI data clearly reports a contraction in Calls OI at this strike in excess of 7,450 contracts. This is almost half the OI for Friday's OPEX. However, the total volume on the day - mixed between BID and ASK volume - did not exceed 4,000. This leaves two options for what happened to this OI: 1) the data is in error and there are missing contracts which UW did not report 2) around 3,000-3,500 of these contracts were exercised during yesterday's trading. 

If the second of these was the case, then our late day run up to $21.75 has some new character in it, insofar as MMs had to deliver 350,000 shares during the trading day in order to meet their obligations. Remember - American-Style Options, different from EU-Style Options can be exercised at \*any time\* and cause price runs of this sort, so long as you have the cash on hand to fulfill the purchase side of the obligation. 

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/9kpdxy4pbbvd1.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9dd0acb2c8ff58697f58a352c1885e7a90d7542

The downside of the Call OI retraction at $20 is that it has substantially weakened the overall gamma positive character of this level. At this point, that is not especially meaningful as we are still some distance away from that strike in terms of our current price level. $20 is not currently in any danger of faltering as a downside support, but it does render this range a bit more unstable if approached. 

From our current price point at around $21.50+, we have a lot of accumulated call gamma underneath us at $21.50 and $21 keep our price buoyant. Some serious put volume would have to come in to destabilize the $21-$22 trading range and it is likely we close the week stuck in this tight $1 trading bracket below $22 (possibly below $21.50). $22 is our largest Gamma position now and serves as a Call Wall overhead highly resistant to intraday options flow to try to overcome it.

While a gamma ramp can be set up and exploited on Friday, it will take a pretty determined downside day today as institutions look to walk the price down to around $21, let it lie flat, and then hit the gas on Friday around midday. This is a possible scenario, but the tight, low-volume see-saw between $21 and $22 with a close at like, I don't know, $21.47 is probably the most likely. 

**Technicals**

[8\/19-10\/15 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/pg0stfw0ebvd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec4caa6008f96d803797fcb39ae2b76a9b5669f)

[8\/19-10\/16 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/9fkdimidebvd1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a43be77677e35fd0ad3cd394b90e77767b80afa)

The 50-day SMA curve is starting to show its new upward list as sub-$21 August daily values are swapped from +$21 October values. This curve will be slow and, barring any wild cards from National Cat Day, projects for a slow late October and early November that looks somewhat like August. This would be a low IV time with overall low volume and a grindy dip toward testing the 200-SMA support once again around mid-November.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/yk06stx0gbvd1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60f75150beda5405c64b4b8a44ddefa40ba1064)

Again, should 10/29 not prove to be a CATalyst, the two weeks prior to December earnings - beginning around Thanksgiving, so the Nov 26-28 range - will showcase an IV 'thumper' pattern just like we saw in the two week lead up to Q2 earnings on September 10. Until then, options premiums will stay pretty light on IV appreciation on otherwise low trading volume.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

The most likely scenario heading into October OPEX is a pin to our $21-$22, though we could see some play in this range over the next two days should institutions decide to try to set the price up a the lower end of this range heading into Friday's trading. Our price action coming out of October OPEX is likely to be somewhat flat - especially if we don't see any excitement on Friday itself - for about a week, perhaps something tight and sideways to really kill IV values into 10/25 Weekly Options Expiry if institutions and options traders are anticipating a CATalyst on 10/29. If we don't get anything on this date, early November is likely to also be flat and tight with a 200-day SMA support test perhaps just post November OPEX (11/15) before our two-week IV thumper pattern into the Q3 earnings report in early December.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",60,1729171140.0,Superstonk,11,0.92,False

We just had the same hobbies and the same job and she really needed a friend cause she was going through a break up from a relationship that lasted 10 years, didn't have a car and just moved, etc. I'm the type of friend that shows up with coffee, is there for errand runs, watching cats etc. especially since I had my own family drama that she helped out a lot with so we we became inseparable. We ended up taking a trip together and it went great, even met amazing men. Fast forward to when we got back and she is upset that one of our mutual guy friends (33m) is upset that she had a fling, this is someone she actively works with now. We all use to work together on the same team until they both went to a a new company. Anyway, she says she now feels guilty about hooking up with the guy on our trip, all while still texting said guy saying she is gonna pay for him to visit her in the states. And I'm just confused as to why the guy (33m) feelings matter if you and this other guy are hitting it off and she states that they (her and 33m) have actually been messing around for a year, the entire time that this man also had a girlfriend. It blew my mind. I would also be invited out with them two and she would set it up as a ""vibe check"" because she liked him but she didn't know if he liked her and also he had a GF. Those few times always ended with me and her hanging watching a movie and being like yeah he has a girlfriend so it doesn't matter and he seems flirty with everyone so idk. All the while she was already messing around with him yet still asking me to play ""wingwoman."" I kinda spazzed because of the a) being the mistresss and then feeling guilty that you hooked up with someone as a single woman but this man has a whole girlfriend and you're okay with it? She says they are going to get married. And I'm like how when he has a girlfriend? All of this while she is still texting the man that we met on our trip. I call her out on the lying and the cheating and the plain manipulation and she basically just makes excuses as if him saying he hasn't slept with his GF in the past month makes up for the other 11 months in the year or her also being a ""bad person"" makes it okay. And I'm like you are not seeing right girl. We end up having multiple conversations where she's like yeah I deserve better and I just need to leave him but we work together and that would be hard. I go on another trip, for longer, and invited her to come along free of charge for a week and she first says she doesn't want to go because she can't see the guy she met, then it was because she didn't want the guy with the girlfriend to be upset that she goes on a trip and the last consideration is for her supposed best friend. When I brought up that this hurt my feelings and that all of the convos we had about our lives and the men we were seeing was a lie and like just a feeling as if I was a replacement until she could get a guy. Guy ends up breaking up with his girlfriend ""supposedly"" and friend makes it seem like I can't say anything bad about him or have feelings about the fact she lied to me and used me as a friend to satisfy whatever he wasn't giving her until now - i.e rides to the store, hanging out every day, companionship. She responds with ""I don't tell you this one thing and this is how you react and none of my other close friends reacted like you and my relationship my business."" This made me call off the friendship - does that make me the asshole? ",6,1729171052.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I've only been in one relationship that lasted just six months when I was 30/31. I went on several first and second dates in my 20s and had a few month-long flings, but nothing that lasted too long often due to lack of interest from the woman I was on dates with. Right when my career was about to take off in my mid-20s, Covid happened, and it took me a few years to get back on my feet to land another job related to my career, since my industry was decimated from the pandemic. I took a few years off dating since I wanted to be better established in my career before considering dating again, and I assumed no woman would want to date a guy who was as shift supervisor at a reputable coffee chain. Anyway, that is a brief history of why I am still single at 32.

I've seen people on this sub claim that if you are single in your 30s and it isn't due to divorce or death of a spouse, there must be something wrong with you. I've noticed that when going on dates, my date will often ask me why I'm still single in my 30s. It's like going into an interview being unemployed and having a gap on your resume, and then your interviewer asks you about it. People just assume you must be damaged goods and you are one of the ""leftovers"", as all the good ones got snatched up in their 20s.

Anyone agree with me? Is there any way to break through the stigma of trying to date past 30?",4,1729171032.0,ChristianDating,6,1.0,False

Every one has given me a bad time.

The only drinks that don't mess with me are pre made shakes but for the life of me I can't figure out why. I tried a Starbucks protein latte today, expecting the worst because it's coffee based, but ive been fine. However I do not want to be paying 3 quid a pop for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

All I can think of at this point is that maybe the way I prepare the shakes? I use a shaker and is that introducing bubbles? Is that an issue. Does anyone have any advice? ",1,1729171031.0,BariatricSurgery,3,1.0,False

Hi! I am currently looking for someone to take over my lease here at Cullen Oaks as I need to move closer to my new job. I am looking to move out asap, but am open to waiting till the spring semester.

I live in a 2Bed 2Bath Grad fully furnished unit at Cullen Oaks, which is on campus. Even though this is student housing, you do NOT have to buy a meal plan. Rent is $1349 and includes utilities. I am offering $250 to anybody who takes my lease right now! 

The Grad refers to the fact that it is fully furnished and comes with a washer and dryer inside the apartment as opposed to having to share one with others. Additionally, there are only 6 Grad Units in the entire apartment complex.

The apartment comes with a couch, dining room table, 3 coffee-like tables in the living room, and in the room, it comes with a dresser, study desk, and a twin xl bed and mattress. 

I live in room B. Unlike my A, room B has the bathroom connected to the room and is much bigger! 

I live with one girl and she’s super sweet and chill! She is usually out majority of the day at work or school, so the place is pretty quiet; if you like having your own space, this is perfect! 

Cullen Oaks has its own 24/7 gym and study center with access to computers and a printer.

As far as parking goes, a parking pass at Cullen allowed you to park at multiple zones at UH. 
1. Cullen Oaks Parking 
2. Zone A
3. Zone D

Tell me if I’m a brat here or if he’s lame. 

New-ish SR. About 2 months. He’s married. 
I think he’s a very nice person and I truly appreciate what he’s done for me. 

The problems:
He gives me just over half the average monthly allowance for my area, by way of using his Amex. Low Xxxx. So this ends up paying for coffees, groceries, not really “spoiling” territory. 

Last month I left a job of 3+ years. I got a new job the next week (better company, huge professional upgrade) I went to COACH to get a handbag to celebrate (low Xxx) and this turned out to not be okay with him. We smooth it out, whatever. 

Now the temperature has dropped. I was walking past some shops and at Aritzia there was a coat that caught my eye (low Xxx.) 
It seems to be a knockoff of the Mackage coat ($Xxxx+) I’ve been wanting for over a year. I tell myself I like the Aritzia coat, it’s cold, and this price is more accessible to me right now. So I bought it, and he was not okay with it. I offered to send him the money from my paycheck and he agreed. He asked me to send him the $ for the coat and I did. 

This is just not why I got into the bowl, am I being a brat or do I need to focus on upgrading my SD?

Hi! So I was in the U.S. on an F1 for a Masters program. Graduated. Got OPT. Gave up OPT. Reported Early Departure and came back to my home country. This was exactly a year ago. 

I got my B1/B2 approved pretty easily and I’m attending my sibling’s wedding in the U.S. PoE is not where they live however. I have a couple coffee chats for a PhD program set up so I’m doing those before I head to their place. 

I just wanted to ask what documents I might have to carry? I assume they’re not going to want to see F1 documents because I’m travelling on a B1B2 and don’t have valid status. But should I take my old EAD card with me just in case? Anything I need to watch out for/be aware of? 

Pretty sure I just enter as a regular tourist with a tourist visa as official documentation and nothing else. But just thought I’d check.

He keeps running out the door and into the woods when I’m not home so we think he is looking for me. The whole time I have been home (to fill out paperwork for disability) he has been following me and whenever I sit/lay down he demands cuddles and keeps screaming until I hold him like a baby. He is essentially a baby, he is also very stupid like a baby but he is in fact two. (He’s a fosterfail because Annie had a kitten pass away from a combo of extremely inverted pectus excavatum + fading kitten probably caused by the pectus excavatum and we got him for her to foster because Annie and I were very distressed. She immediately grabbed him when I leaned down to show her and lugged him off to her kittens, we didn’t even need to make him smell like the other kittens she just grabbed him lol. We kept him. Annie loves kittens so much, she is also very attached to him and treats him like a kitten still. Even though she’s fixed now she tries to mother kittens when I babysit them or when my sister got a new kitten. When I get my own place I feel like Annie would be a great companion to help me foster kittens. She is a mama at heart. Stinky is also a great older brother! He’s very friendly and social like Annie. I find this interesting, I wonder if he would have been this freindly if his skiddish birth mom still had him, he had nine siblings and tiny mama was stressed I feel like he would have become food agressive at least. Annie only had two other babies though so I think that and the fact that Annie is a super loving mother cat influenced him to be more freindly. Although he did develop separation anxiety and screams if we close a door in the house until we let him in. Of if he just wants attention and we aren’t in the immediate area he will scream until somone either speaks loudly do he can hear or until we go up and coddle him like a baby. 😭 The other picks are of him, Annie, and his little sister ducky who’s got a broken squeaker she can’t meow  only quiet noises we aren’t sure what it was but when she was little even nursing on her mom she would get milk/water in her lungs, when we first got her (at a little under 7 weeks) we would keep her in her own little kennel to monitor her and make sure she was ok. After a lot of coughing she would be fine but I think the two are linked. Now she’s very heathy and doesn’t get fluid in her lungs anymore (we made sure by listening to her after she drinks after she got bigger.) she is super energetic but super skiddish towards people because the dude who had them didn’t pick up or play with the kittens at all but if you don’t move she will come up to you  and try to play. Unless you’re my mom or Annie oml she loves mom. She’s learned to go ‘meh’ back to us if we go ‘duck duck! Meh!’ Or just ‘meh!’ It’s very cute.)
We have another cat named sir but he is grumpy and hates when stinky/Ducky try to play with him (he got an injury to his back legs he cause he’s unfortunately an outdoor/indoor cat, if we try to keep him inside he decides to protest by peeing and spraying everywhere even though he’s fixed. He disappeared for weeks and came back with his legs healed funny, although he can walk fine just strange. The two younger cats when trying to play with him go for his back legs that go injured, he’s their grumpy adoptive dad. Annie doesn’t play with him because she prefers to clean and cuddle him. Tall fluffy cat wife and short grumpy cat husband lol. I should make him a little suit and bow tie and make Annie a harness dress and make a little cat wedding for them :] )
I hope you like our little cat family :]]]
(Also all of Annie’s biological children are in loving homes, two from her first litter live at my grandmas and are very spoiled, we even built them a cattio so grandma can sit outside with them without letting them out. One lives with an elderly cat at an old couples house. One lived at my cousins but they gave him to their neighbors because he likes them more and his grandma (cousin owns his dad’s mom who is also fixed) hated him (her name is Vicious for a reason, she is a mean old lady. Hates everyone but my cousin. She is very soft and tiny though.) The one that passed (Coffee, I was going to keep Coffee because I knew she was special needs. Unfortunately by the time we realized how severe her ribcadge was inverted she was too weak for surgery + we didn’t have one thousand to spend on the risky surgery. Annie and I cuddled and comforted her as she passed, Annie was very distressed.) buried under I giant boulder I rolled over her grave to act as a gravestone + blocking things that might dig her up. I painted on it, I like to think she watches over Annie and all the babies she’s cared for. And the two surviving siblings Hazelnut and Mocha (the litter had dunkin/coffee themed names. Munchkin is adopted so I named him after a donut.) currently live with an elderly cat and a friendly little dog at my dad’s freind’s place with a little toddler who likes lugging them around, they are also fixed :]])",5,1729170309.0,cats,0,1.0,False

Have you ever gone through the nerve-wracking experience of asking someone out in person? Or maybe you've battled the confusing terrain of trying to interpret someone's signals and not quite knowing if they're into you or just being friendly?

I came across a blog recently that really resonated with me. It talked about the challenges we face when navigating the dating world - from risking rejection when asking someone out, to interpreting ambiguous signals, to bouncing back after a 'no-thanks-I-just-see-you-as-a-friend' situation. 

In this age of dating apps, it's not uncommon to feel a little out of practice when it comes to the old-school, in-person approach. The blog reminded us that while timing and approach are crucial, it's equally important to engage in a friendly conversation first to gauge their interest. 

And let's not forget the subtle art of signal interpretation. Is that laugh a sign of interest or just a polite response? Decoding these signals can be tricky and requires being attentive and discerning.

Of course, there's the inevitable rejection. But instead of viewing it as a failure, we should see it as a learning experience. It's all about maintaining a positive outlook, focusing on self-improvement, and above all, resilience.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Have you ever asked someone out in person and how did it go? Do you have any tips on interpreting signals? How do you deal with rejection and bounce back? 

Remember, we're all in this together. So, let's share our stories, learn from each other, and make this dating game a little less daunting!",1,1729170112.0,wifeplanet,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Seriously. I’ve tried too many coffee makers, but this one stands out because of its MultiStream Technology. Fancy term, right? But it just means better-tasting coffee—think rich, even flavor every time. Whether you need to grab a quick cup or want to enjoy a slow morning, this thing makes it easy.

**Design & Features I Love:**

* **Compact & Sleek:** Doesn’t hog all my counter space, and that black finish just looks good.
* **Big Water Tank:** 66 oz. removable water reservoir, so you’re not refilling it every time you need a cup. Easy to clean too.
* **Customizable Settings:** Want it strong? Hit the “Strong” button. Got hot weather? Brew right over ice without it getting watery. 6, 8, 10, 12 oz. options to pick from. It’s like having your own mini coffee shop.

The **MultiStream Tech** means more water saturates the grounds evenly, giving you that full, rich taste without any bitterness. It’s legit better than the old Keurig K-Classic I had.

**User Experience:** Setting it up was a breeze, even half-asleep at 6 a.m. It’s quiet, quick, and doesn’t have any unnecessary bells and whistles to mess with.

**Pros:**

* **Brew ID Feature:** This smart tech figures out the best brew settings for the pod you put in—super convenient, but you can tweak it if you’re picky like me.
* **Hot Over Ice Feature:** Brew a coffee that stays flavorful over ice.

**Cons:**

* It’s a bit... delicate? I’ve read (and experienced) some issues with the machine overheating during cleaning cycles. Just a heads up.
* Also, don’t jiggle the K-Cup holder too much—it feels a bit flimsy.

Overall, for the price (around $138 on Amazon), the Keurig K-Supreme gives you a premium coffee experience without the premium price tag. It's simple, reliable, and the quality of the coffee?

Autumn is a peak time of year for NLOGism to develop and spread. To protect yourself and your loved ones from Autumnal NLOGism, be on the lookout for the following signs and symptoms:

* Making unsolicited negative comments about pumpkin spice flavored or scented products, especially when paired with a nonsensically long name for coffee (ex: ""mocha frappe caramel sprinkle foam latte"")
* Belief that enjoying Halloween, Goth fashion, horror movies, or true crime makes someone countercultural, edgy, more interesting, or otherwise somehow superior - these are all extremely mainstream and popular 
* Any sexual fetishizing or romanticizing of real or fictional serial killers or violent criminals
* Comparing oneself to Wednesday Addams (particularly in reference to the 1993 live-action movie)
* Unsolicited criticism of other women's Halloween costumes or activities (for reasons other than potential offensiveness)
* Loud and pervasive disdain for upcoming Christmas (for reasons other than religious criticism and/or trauma)
* Disparagement of Ugg boots, sweaters, flat-brimmed felt hats, or leggings, especially when worn in combo - if a certain photo of many women wearing these clothes as a group is posted on social media with a disparaging caption, autumnal NLOGism may have already developed
* Belief that enjoying football, knowing the rules of the game, knowing the teams playing, etc. makes someone superior or more appealing to men
* Any negative or comparison-based commentary on what other women may or may not cook and/or eat at Thanksgiving

Even if you or a loved one are showing signs or symptoms of Autumnal NLOGism, treatment may help to mitigate symptoms before they develop into Total NLOGism, a condition which lasts the entirety of the year and can be damaging. Treatments include self-awareness, self-reflection, developing real friendships with other women, and acknowledging that women are not a monolithic hivemind. 

Ask your therapist if unlearning internalized misogyny is right for you!

I love younger women

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!😛

That said…I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

***As the global CBD market is projected to reach $47 billion by 2028, CBDL's groundbreaking product innovations, retail expansion, and strategic partnerships position the company for unparalleled growth and industry leadership.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ / ACCESSWIRE / October 17, 2024 /** CBD Life Sciences, Inc. (CBDL), a trailblazer in the rapidly expanding CBD and wellness industry, proudly announces a remarkable 1744.00% increase in revenue since February 2024. This exponential growth reflects the company's relentless commitment to innovation, product diversification, and high-impact partnerships, solidifying its position as a dominant force in the CBD market.

**Shareholder Value and Investor Confidence Soar Amid Key Milestones**  
CBDL's extraordinary financial performance is a clear signal to shareholders and investors of the company's growth potential and long-term value. Through strategic decisions and continued market expansion, CBDL is executing on its vision to not just meet but surpass market demand. The company's current trajectory offers an unmatched opportunity for investors seeking to align with a high-growth, innovative company that's transforming the CBD industry.

**Key Drivers of Growth and Innovation**  
Since February 2024, CBDL has introduced cutting-edge products that have captivated consumers and opened new revenue streams:

* **Mellow Mornings Nano-CBD Coffee Creamer**: This breakthrough product utilizes advanced nanotechnology, enhancing the bioavailability of CBD by up to 10 times compared to traditional formulations. Available in Vanilla and Classic flavors, *Mellow Mornings* has quickly become a bestseller, now featured in local coffee shops for CBD-infused beverages. The product's innovative design and growing popularity continue to contribute significantly to CBDL's revenue growth.
* **CBD Horse Paste**: Entering the multi-billion-dollar pet care market, CBDL launched its veterinarian-designed *CBD Horse Paste*, a product addressing both the physical and psychological needs of horses. This launch has not only diversified our offerings but tapped into an underserved, high-demand market, positioning CBDL for continued growth in the animal wellness sector.
* **Nutritional Supplement Powder**: Building on the wellness trend, CBDL introduced a powerful nutritional supplement combining *reishi mushroom extract*, *lion's mane mushroom extract*, and *ashwagandha root extract* to offer stress relief, cognitive enhancement, and immune support. Discussions with a major U.S. organization regarding this supplement's use in its health programs are expected to open new avenues for substantial future revenue.

**Retail Expansion Amplifies Growth**  
CBDL's presence on key retail platforms has been a pivotal factor in the company's success. In August 2024, the company entered the **Walmart Marketplace**, unlocking access to millions of new consumers. This partnership significantly boosted product visibility and sales, positioning CBDL as a mainstream choice for CBD wellness products.

CBDL's upcoming expansion onto **Alibaba's wholesale platform** promises even greater growth, providing a pathway to international markets and amplifying global brand recognition. This move is poised to accelerate our growth trajectory as we capitalize on the increasing demand for premium CBD products across the globe.

**Strategic Partnerships and New Revenue Channels**  
CBDL has entered into strategic agreements that have opened doors to new markets and expanded distribution channels. These collaborations have played a crucial role in the 1744.00% revenue growth since early 2024, and they are expected to continue driving strong financial performance well into the future. The company is also negotiating with prominent organizations in both the health and wellness sectors, further positioning CBDL as a key player in the industry's evolution.

**Looking Ahead: Positioned for Sustained Growth**  
""Our growth this year has been nothing short of extraordinary, and it's just the beginning,"" said Lisa Nelson, President and CEO of CBD Life Sciences, Inc. ""We've made calculated moves that have transformed the company into a recognized leader in the CBD and wellness space. Our beloved shareholders and future investors can expect continued strong performance as we roll out new products, expand into international markets, and build on our existing success.""

Nelson also emphasized the company's commitment to driving shareholder value through innovation, quality, and expansion. ""As we close out the year, we're doubling down on efforts to maintain our growth momentum. The global wellness market is expanding rapidly, and CBDL is positioned to lead that charge with a pipeline of groundbreaking products and strategic partnerships.""

**Why Invest in CBD Life Sciences, Inc.**  
CBDL's commitment to product innovation, market expansion, and strategic partnerships positions the company for sustained revenue growth and profitability. As the global demand for CBD and wellness products continues to rise, CBDL offers investors a compelling opportunity to be part of an industry-leading company with a proven track record of performance.

CBD Life Sciences is set to end 2024 with record-breaking growth, an expanding international footprint, and a product portfolio that continues to resonate with a diverse range of consumers. For investors seeking exposure to a high-growth market with significant upside potential, CBDL represents a smart, strategic choice.",1,1729168650.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

Cabrera looks down at his plate. Nothing but tiny crumbs left. For the life of him, he can’t explain how he ate it so fast. Nor can he explain how he can stomach any food while listening to something so grisly. From the corner of his eye, he sees Alvaro cringe; her cinnamon bun left untouched since the first bite. ﻿

Alvaro takes a sip of her coffee, instead. He debates internally, pondering whether to sneak his fork over and swipe it from her plate, or to wait a little longer. *Just another minute*... He sits, waiting impatiently for an end to the uncomfortable silence that hangs in the dining room.

Darling eyes Cabrera’s empty plate. “Before I continue, would you like some more, Detective? I can fetch another from the kitchen.”

“Yes, please!” He answers without hesitation, like a grateful, greedy little boy bubbling with excitement as he peers into a candy shop window. Off she goes with the empty plate. Cabrera sits tight, eagerly awaiting his second serving.

“This is absurd, just ridiculous!” Alvaro bursts with indignance. “Does she think we’d believe *that* story?”

He shrugs. “I’ve heard that a lot of crazy things happen in San Judas.”

“Oh, God, really now? Don’t start with your bizarro theories...”

“I mean, why not listen to what she’s got to say? She knows something about Jacobs’ death. And there could be clues she’s dropping in her story, no matter how ridiculous it sounds.”

Alvaro shakes her head and scoffs. “Jorge, she’s just conjuring up a fake story to distract us. We need to get her to the clinic. If not, then perhaps we can take something from the house that has her hair follicles, like a hairbrush or—”

“Elise, we can’t just take things without a warrant.”

“It’s probable cause. We don’t know what she has. She doesn’t know either. Maybe it’s-”

Darling waltzes into the room with a fresh plate of cinnamon bun for Cabrera. He salivates instantly. 

A smile appears on her round, matronly face. “I should tell you how I got my eyes back. That’s when things truly changed for me.”

Alvaro lets out a low, frustrated hiss through her teeth. “Mrs. Ross, where are we going with this? Tell us exactly what you know about Robert Jacobs!”

“I *will* tell you, dear. Be patient.”

The police discovered the boys’ organs in the fridge. Their limbs were out in the cemetery, right in the exact same spot where Bo had poked at that strange, dead creature. Their arms, legs, and torsos had been ripped to shreds, as if by a large animal. The house was searched. Every room, every crevice, and every little hole in the walls. But Momma was nowhere to be found.﻿

I told everyone that the aswang was real. But, of course, no one believed me.

The boys’ deaths left people shaken, absolutely terrified. Mom became catatonic while Dad mostly went on as if everything was normal. He still went to work every day and read the Bible and prayed. But he stopped telling me stories. Instead, he would go out for long walks at night for hours at a time. Sometimes he wouldn’t come home until the next morning.

And no one believed me when I told them that the aswang took my eyes. Folks came up with their own theories. Some said I did it to get attention. But the doctors figured a rare disease—anophthalmia—was the cause of my missing eyes.

Since my family was Catholic, they believed it was God’s punishment for going into the house in the first place. Dad used to say: ‘Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them.’

And, so in their minds, I was unclean. I knew—not *entirely*, it was more like a feeling—but I knew they blamed me for what happened to Junior. Like I should’ve gone straight home and told them what he’d been up to. They didn’t say or do anything. They wouldn’t even hold my hand to comfort me. I was all alone, left with no one to guide me in the darkness. And then, one night, Momma came to visit.

Momma didn’t have a form; but I could feel her presence all around me. The air felt different—heavier, tense, cold. But it was all strangely comforting. It embraced and consoled me.

*You’ll see again with my eyes*, she told me.

Then, this powerful force pushed me back onto the bed. My arms and legs were pinned down. I tried to wiggle away, but Momma was too strong. Then I realized that this itchy, pins-and-needles feeling was the work of dozens, even hundreds, of tiny spiders! Their little spindling legs crawled up my cheeks and into my eyes, burying into each socket.

I could feel them filling up to the breaking point, like balloons about to burst inside a tiny pore. The pressure kept building. I thought my head was going to explode!

When I finally woke up the next day, I saw gray silhouettes of items around my room. Little by little, sight returned to me. I could see everything! Clear as day! Colors! Light! My bedroom! But I also saw the horrified faces of my family, staring back at me. Mom fainted. Dad went white as a ghost and pissed in his pants.

He was the first to say something. And I will always remember what he said: Oh, my poor Darling, you have the eyes of the Devil!

He wasn’t wrong. I looked in the mirror and saw the Devil, too.

Since then, I hid behind bug-eyed sunglasses. I never took them off. Not ever. From that point on, my family wouldn’t even look at me. Dad lost his appetite. Mom fainted when she saw my Devil’s eyes. They told the school I had an eye operation that had gone wrong. I was a quiet student. No one bothered or noticed me. That is, until Clara Cooke came along.

Over forty years later I still can’t forget about her. In most people’s eyes she was a bubbly, cheerful girl. Everyone thought she had a little golden halo over her light-brown curls, like a Shirley Temple reincarnation. But she had a mean streak. Underneath the ‘good girl’ smile and rosy cheeks was a thoughtless, cold-hearted creature. She preyed on anyone she thought was beneath her.

She came up to me one day with her two sidekicks, and dared to ask me, ‘If you take the sunglasses off, like, do your eyes shrink when they’re in the light?’
I told her that I didn’t understand.

Clara laughed, and her goons laughed with her. I’ll never forget what that little monster said next. ‘You know, do your eyes get more chinky and, like, you can’t see? Is that why you wear those ugly sunglasses?’

She pretended to have slits for eyes. They all let out this roaring laughter, like they were werewolves howling at the moon.

I told them that I could see just fine and called them a bunch of dumb bitches. And then that girl laid a sunburning slap on my cheek so hard, it knocked off my sunglasses. I reached down to pick them up, but she crushed the lenses with her foot. I threw her the nastiest glare I could muster up. It reminded me of a Bible verse: ‘the eye is the lamp of your body; when your eyes are clear, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your whole body is full of darkness.’

Darkness filled every inch of my body in that moment.

The girls were so scared they almost shat their pants, and they scampered away. Still, that didn’t stop Clara from coming up with a nickname. Oh, she thought she was so clever. I heard the whispers; the talking behind my back. They called me Icky Iguana. By third period, the whole student body started calling me ‘Guana’, like it was my God-given birth name. The class wouldn’t stop their jabbering and pointing.

Our science teacher, Mr. Mann, hollered for everyone to shut up.

He demanded to know: ‘Who are you calling an iguana?’

Their eyes fell on me.

I tried to shrink away, down to the size of the smallest molecule. The left side of my sunglasses had cracked, and most of the right lens was missing. Mr. Mann took one look and clutched his chest like he was about to have a heart attack. He went up to the blackboard and lectured the class about the similarities and differences between iguana and crocodile eyes.

Students couldn’t stop giggling, and Clara had the widest shit-eating grin all over her fake, ‘innocent’ face. I wish I had the satisfaction of smacking it off. But I didn’t have to. Because, you see, this omnipotent being sent a miracle! Not God. Momma.

I watched that smile transform into a grimace in a heartbeat. Her hand flew to her throat like she got something stuck, and all of a sudden, her face was redder than a tomato. Then, she reached into her mouth and started pulling something out, like a magician with an endless rope of colorful cloth. The thing in her throat landed wet and hard on the floor.

It was the longest and fattest centipede I ever laid my eyes on!

The centipede crawled around the room. Dazed and confused. You should’ve seen the others. I thought their eyes were going to pop right out of their skulls! Clara birthed a dozen more out of that vile mouth. The last one was the biggest of them all. It opened up her mouth so wide, that once it pulled itself out, her lower jaw was dangling loosely off a single thread of muscle.

Oh, don’t worry. She lived. By sixth period, the whole town knew who Centi-Clara was. It made the front page of the county newspaper. TEN-FOOT INSECT CAUSES HAVOC AT SAN JUDAS HIGH! This made Mr. Mann upset, because centipedes aren’t insects, and the news editor had been his student.

The darkness that I had felt before faded. and gave way to light. Everyone thought I did it to her. Maybe I did, but do you know what that meant? Momma gave me a gift. No one in that school ever dared to cross me again.

Politely, Darling asks to be excused. She must attend to her sickly husband.﻿
“What the *fuck*!” Alvaro shouts once she is gone. “What are we doing here, Jorge? This is too much! Certainly, she’s not right in the head.”

Cabrera taps ‘pause’ on his smartphone. “You don’t believe her?”

Alvaro gawks at him, shaking her head in disbelief. “And you do? Did we not listen to the same story? The woman claims she lost her eyes and that an aswang—demon or witch or whatever she calls it— regrew her eyes with super spiders!”

“It’s possible.”

“You’re kidding, right? Jorge, come on.”

“I know you don’t believe in the supernatural, but I think if you just open...” He pauses and sighs. “Look, have I told you about my family?”

“No, you haven’t.”

“I haven’t?”

“You rarely talk about that part of your life.”

“I’m going to tell you something that I’ve never told anyone.”

Alvaro straightens up in her seat. A look of concern flashes across her face. “Okay, I’m listening.”

He fumbles with his fingers for a moment, hesitant to delve too deeply. No, I can’t. A bead of sweat drips down his forehead as he vacillates.  

*Come on*, says a voice from within. *It’s been three decades*. *Someone needs to know*. 

He’s entrusted Elise to have his back on the field. Maybe, then, he can trust her with his secrets, too.

“I had an older sister; her name was Elena,” he begins. “She was three years older than me. Just the best sister you could ask for. Our lives changed when she got sick, I think she was about twelve years old. At first, she had a fever and chills. Then she started refusing food, preferring raw, warm meat. She changed... transformed into something…”

He pauses for a moment, remembering the pale face of his sister, and the way she stared at him with ferocious, reptilian eyes.

“My parents took her to the doctors,” he continues, “but they had no idea what it was. Elena’s behavior grew worse, almost like an animal. She bit the nurse on the face. I was there. I saw her feed on a woman’s face! I knew that she wasn’t my sister anymore. She was gone and something else was inside of her.”

“Oh, God...” Alvaro gasps.

“The nurse survived, though she lost both eyes, most of her lips and about half of her nose.”

“What do you think was wrong with your sister?”

“It’s obvious, isn’t it? She was possessed.”

“Possessed?”

He nods. “By a demon.”

“A demon?”

Cabrera takes another bite of the cinnamon bun, registering Alvaro’s look of concerned disbelief. She may not believe it now, but he is certain she will come around. He licks the fork and dips into the bun again.

“Yes, a demon,” he says.

“So, what happened to Elena?”

“She escaped the hospital and was run over in a traffic accident. And as if it was all some cruel joke that God had played on us...my dad was the driver.”

“Oh, shit, I’m so sorry, Jorge. That must’ve been so traumatizing. But how does this connect to Mrs. Ross’s story?”

“I think she’s possessed, like how Elena was possessed.”

“How do you know that? Mrs. Ross seems fine.”

“It’s a feeling, Elise. Perhaps the demon inside her is dormant right now, and just waiting for the right time to strike.”

Cabrera lifts up the fork and dives in for another slice, but Alvaro slaps his hands away.

“Stop eating it,” she says.

“It’s rude not to finish what’s offered to you when you are a guest in someone else’s home.”

“We’re not houseguests. We’re investigators on official business!”

Alvaro gets up.

“Elise, wait,” he says, grabbing the cuff of her jacket. “Where are you going?”

“We need something that can tie her to Jacobs’ death.”

“How? We can’t just snoop around without a court order.”

Before Alvaro answers, the door swings open. Darling breezes into the dining room with a pot of coffee and a brand-new plate of cinnamon bun. She refills Cabrera’s mug and sets the plate down before him.

“I hope you’re not going just yet,” she says as Alvaro inches her way towards the door. “Oh, please stay, I haven’t finished my story.”

“Actually, I need to use the bathroom. So, where is it?”

“It’s under the stairs.”

Alvaro leaves the room, while Cabrera moans in delight as he digs into the second helping.

“Mmm…Well, don’t worry, Mrs. Ross,” he says. “I won’t be leaving until I’ve finished this.” He points to the bun and cuts off another piece. “But you’ve got to tell me your secret recipe for this!”

“Oh, it’s no secret,” Darling says, giggling. “I’m sure you can look up on the Internet and find a recipe.”

“But yours hits so differently!”

He licks his finger so as not to waste any of its sweet flavor.

Her smile widens. “Yes, well, maybe I did put a little more love, a little more care into it.”
The corded phone rings again.

Darling bolts from her chair, leaving it wobbling from the sudden movement. She strides over to the wall to pick it up and listens for what seems like a split second, before slamming it back on the hook. Not a word is spoken to the caller.

Cabrera resumes recording. “Okay, Mrs. Ross, let’s go on with the story. What did you mean when you said that Momma gave you a gift?”

“Let’s just say...I could do any and all things through her. It is she who strengthens me.”

“And your eyes...”

“My eyes? What about them?”

“You said they were unusual, but they look normal.”

“Well, that’s the miracle of contact lenses!”

“And the centipede incident, did that really happen?”

“I don’t lie.”

“Well, that’s good to know! So, let’s fast forward a bit to the part where you met your first husband.”

“Which one, dear?”

“Start with the first and we’ll go from there.”

Darling’s smile wavers, and her eyes sink. Tiny, inadvertent slips of the mask. Then she catches herself. And without hesitation the warm, maternal smile returns; lighting up her face from cheek to cheek. Memories of her past marriages resurface.

Her smile widens. “Yes, well, maybe I did put a little more love, a little more care into it.”
The corded phone rings again.

Darling bolts from her chair, leaving it wobbling from the sudden movement. She strides over to the wall to pick it up and listens for what seems like a split second, before slamming it back on the hook. Not a word is spoken to the caller.

Cabrera resumes recording. “Okay, Mrs. Ross, let’s go on with the story. What did you mean when you said that Momma gave you a gift?”

“Let’s just say...I could do any and all things through her. It is she who strengthens me.”

“And your eyes...”

“My eyes? What about them?”

“You said they were unusual, but they look normal.”

“Well, that’s the miracle of contact lenses!”

“And the centipede incident, did that really happen?”

“I don’t lie.”

“Well, that’s good to know! So, let’s fast forward a bit to the part where you met your first husband.”

“Which one, dear?”

“Start with the first and we’ll go from there.”

Darling’s smile wavers, and her eyes sink. Tiny, inadvertent slips of the mask. Then she catches herself. And without hesitation the warm, maternal smile returns; lighting up her face from cheek to cheek. Memories of her past marriages resurface.

Was diagnosed with ADHD in August and was put on Elvanse.

I write my experience with each dose over a 2 week duration:

20 mg: Would get awfully sleepy after ~1 hour after taking the medication. Would literally have to sleep all day which means couldn't sleep at night. Total torture, switched to 30 mg on day 10 as was intolerable.

30 mg: Was still habitually drinking coffee, had terrible headaches a couple of hours after taking medication, couldn't sleep at night.  Switched coffee to decaf, took magnesium at night and tyrosine supplement in the morning, with drinking plenty of fluids with electrolytes the side effects resolved. Impact on symptoms: For over a decade I had never felt my brain is ""awake, was always awfully groggy. With medication I felt my brain is awake in the morning. Slight improvement in impulsivity (for the first time in years my mom could finish a sentence!). No impact on focus, executive function, or motivation. Still unable to move or do anything.

40 mg: Weird experience with orthostatic hypotension, may or may not be related to medication. Felt dizzy standing up, such that I couldn't do anything other than lying down. Added plenty of salt to food and fluids, got a bit better, but not entirely. No added impact on symptoms.

50 mg: Blood pressure stabilised, no side effects other than could not sleep at night. Added 10mg melatonin before going to bed, managed to get ~6 hours light sleep.
Impact on symptoms: improved focus several hours after taking medication. The improved focus however was associated with worsening in executive function, such that for over a week all I would do was spend 12+ hours solving Soduku, or some othe useless mind engaging activity whilst forgetting to eat or drink. No improvement in motivation. Work productivity and focus on work stuff remained zero (maybe even worse than non-medicated as I was stuck playing games all day)

60 mg: Note by this time I barely leave the house once every 2-3 weeks if absolutely necessary. I am a completely useless space occupying object. 60 mg was a sudden game changer!!! I take the medication on empty stomach whilst still in bed and stay in bed for hours after I should be up. First day on 60 mg I felt an urge to get up and start my day (a totally unfamiliar sensation!). I have actually managed to get work done without feeling as though opening my laptop is tantamount to lifting a mountain, I did house chores, I feel like a human who is happy to interact with others, leave the house, and take pleasure in something. Managed to go for a swim for a first time in many months. It's only been a few days, I hope it lasts!

Throwaway because I don't want said shitty ex-friends finding my account

This is part 1 of 2.

So, this story (5e campaign) happened over about a year or so, finishing up roughly this January, all over Discord although we were all friends in person. The tale is incredibly long and somewhat complicated, so I apologise if it’s a little messy. There’s some jumping around as well, since a few things happened at once. I also don’t have access to almost any evidence about this story beyond my personal notes, as I left the discord and have no interest in asking to return. But I have compared stories with those of the party who are still my friends to make sure it’s as accurate as can be. The whole event ultimately led to my 7+ year friend group splitting into two, an 8+ year friendship I had with the DM and a 5+ year friendship with the rogue crashing and burning, and my desire to never play any tabletop game ever again.

The main players of this story are Me, (Drow, Bard), Rogue (Human (sort of, he had wings and I’m sure some tragic backstory to explain away his overpoweredness, but he never told us), and the DM, with a bonus feature by our Paladin (Human). We also had a Druid (not a problem player herself but supportive of terrible actions) and a Barbarian in the party, both of whom aren’t really relevant to the events I’ll discuss. We were all in our early 20s during this story.

To start, all members of our party had been some level of friend since high school, some closer than others, and played together during our senior year with another ex-friend DM (who turned out to be not a great person, foreshadowing a pattern). The campaign of this story was technically only my 3rd, but at its beginning I had been playing for some time, maybe six years or so, and *only* with this group, so I didn’t have a great frame of reference for what made a “good” campaign beyond “yeah I don’t hate it!”. Our friend group essentially grew around DND; it was practically a part of our identity – our main hangouts as a group were DND related. This is probably why, as you’ll come to see, it was a very difficult choice for someone to leave, seeing that it would sever these ties.

The campaign was, to my knowledge, almost entirely homebrew, and the DM really encouraged us to be as free as we liked with character creation, saying he would build the world around what we all wanted to do. This was not true as – the first of many red flags to come – it was only after two of us came to him with elf characters, my character and the Druid, that the DM revealed that the world contained very large amounts of systematic elf-specific slavery. This was never even hinted at prior. Although Druid and I offered to make new characters, DM insisted it would be fine, so we continued on with character creation. This will come up later.

Despite this small bump, we were all happy to start another campaign together. We filled out consent forms and described what we wanted from the campaign – all the stuff people recommend you do before a campaign starts to make sure everyone at the table remains happy and healthy. Then, we set off on our journey.

It's important to note that, at the beginning of the campaign, Rogue’s player was not playing Rogue, but a ranger-artificer demi-god thing? I’m not sure. Their player had a habit of making incredibly complex characters, both genetically (“here’s five generations of my characters’ family with factions and irrelevant info, also btw I think I should get *all* of their traits”) and backstory-wise (often creating important world lore that they never put past the DM beforehand, which the DM had confessed to me to absolutely hate, though they never told the Rogue). Now, I’m of the opinion that the shorter a backstory the better, because the best parts of a character happen when, you know, you’re playing them, so you can grow with them. But ultimately ranger-artificer wasn’t my character, and overall the player seemed to greatly enjoy the journey of fleshing out their characters to the pore, so it was none of my business (though hoarding secret knowledge that is never revealed but will bite any fellow player that crosses them will come in again later in this story).

Ranger-artificer came in a few sessions after the rest of us (for a reason I can’t remember), and most importantly *after* we had all described our characters to their player – their player knew our characters' race and classes. Drow, as you might know, have sunlight sensitivity, which is something I had planned around in creating my character (eg, focusing on saving throw spells rather than attack-rolls).

So, with this knowledge, what does ranger-artificer enter as? A character who is constantly glowing *with light.* I’m not certain if the light was ever specifically *sunlight* (though I believe their damage with it was the radiant type) and when I brought it up to the DM they said it wouldn’t affect my Drow’s sensitivity (and therefore give me constant disadvantage). However, when I confided in my friend (the DM) that it seemed like kind of a dick move (since they KNEW I was playing a Drow beforehand) they said something like “Well that’s what you get for making a Drow”. Though the comment irked me at the time, I put it behind me, assuming that ranger-artificer’s player simply couldn’t alter their character after learning about mine and relieved at least it wouldn’t affect my rolls. Consider this red flag two for this DM.

Anyway, about 7-ish sessions into the campaign, the ranger-artificer began having a serious conflict with the Paladin. Now, conflicts between characters were not uncommon in our campaigns, as most of us enjoyed intra-party arguments to a safe extent. However, the ranger-artificer/Paladin conflict had become a multi-session-long resolution attempt. The situation is too complicated to explain here, but to oversimply it ranger-artificer *accidentally* kinda killed Paladin’s sister (she was already dead but Paladin believed she was alive, possessed by cultists or something, and despite being told an area of effect spell could “kill her” by DM and PCs both (Paladin specifically told ranger-artificer *not* to), the ranger-artificer did it anyway (specifically aiming at that NPC I believe) in session TWO, and they never really got over it. I will say that, although ranger-artificer’s player is the problem player of this story, in this specific case it was for the most part Paladin’s fault, a fact which they have since come to realise and feel guilty about, and tried to do better in the campaign going forward. Before this, ranger-artificer and my character had gotten along quite well, and when the conflict ultimately ended with that player choosing to leave the game, which we all respected, I was sad to see her go.

I bring up this particular issue because what later happened once they returned will cast their actions – especially regarding being cruel to other players – in an INCREDIBLY hypocritical light.

Time passed and we continued playing – much kinder to each other, checking in a lot more, ect ect – while continuing our friendship with that player outside of the game until a few months later the DM revealed that she would be returning. We hurrah, because we missed her and knew she enjoyed DND very much. But, personally, all celebration screeched to a halt as the DM revealed that the player would be playing as “Rogue”.

Rogue was not new to the group. In our 2 and 2.5 campaigns (run by our original ex-friend DM and later picked up by my ex-friend DM 2.0), the player’s character was the very same Rogue (by name, anyway), and he was downright *horrible*. I’m sure you’re all familiar with the type of character, but here are a few stand-out characteristics;

·       Long and complicated lineage that allowed him heat sense, ability to sprout bird wings (with flight speed), and insane (regularly 20+) perception and insight

·       A rogue (assassin, I think?) with insane stealth and the personality to match

·       Refused to speak about his backstory, or himself, or absolutely anything, even when prompted by DM, NPCs, and PCs, and *even during his own plot* (the DM of the “current” campaign once described playing with Rogue akin to “playing tennis with drapes”)

·       Downright refused to interact with any plot, at any time, “because its what my character would do”. Quite literally there were certain points where we had to either beg him, command him, or drag him into the plot because he just… refused to go.

So, I hope you understand why hearing that Rogue was returning did not fill me with confidence. Nevertheless, the DM said that, this time around, Rogue had been planned to be played as he was originally intended, and that he was a bit of a struggle in the last campaign because of old DM interference.

I was still doubtful, but ultimately I hoped for the best, and we all welcomed Rogue into the campaign with open arms.

This was where the worst six months of my life began.

“New and Improved” Rogue was WORSE. So, so much worse.

Rogue was introduced at pretty much the beginning of my character’s plot, wherein she needed to return to her home nation and save them from, essentially, a genocide. I’m not joking. A human-based force had come to try and take all the Drow and put them into some kind of magical slavery and/or death. The pressure was on.

It was a few sessions before the party arrived at my Drow’s homeland, and during this time we learnt that Rogue was a friend to the DMPC and, overall, secretive to the point of annoyance and snarky to the point of dislike. But, hey, he had just been introduced, so I for one assumed his player was planning for a long character arc, which we were all quite fond of. In fact, I was excited to see where this “new and improved” Rogue would go, and so tried to put aside my trepidations.

The real issues arrived, however, when we reached the homeland.

Rogue, as was revealed over the following sessions, was a racist, secretive, lying, genocide-supporting asshole. And this was his “improved”/“how he was intended” character.

First and foremost, Rogue came out of the gate trashing on anything Drow. I’m talking their music, their food, their architecture, their system of government, their *blankets* – an actual example, yes, he picked up a blanket and critiqued its quality when it had *never before been mentioned*. If he ever had a chance to shit on anything Drow (which there sure was a lot of because we were stuck at their capital *under siege*), he did. My character was the Drow’s Prime Minister of sorts, acting as a cultural icon, and so these many, many insults to everything about her people, culture, and government of which she was a central part, stung. I as a player wasn’t happy about it either, but again I thought perhaps his player had a character arc planned, so I either counteracted the insults as best I could (“the food’s shit” “we’re under siege”) or ignored them.

Things proceeded to get worse.

One important note is that, during my character's plot, the DM told me that the plot was hour-by-hour – meaning, if I spent too long in one place, I would miss something happening in another. This, naturally, stressed me out. I had also asked the DM before the campaign’s start that I wanted a clear, simple, black-and-white plot, because I knew my memory issues would get in the way and, like the last campaign he ran, the complex plot really soured my enjoyment because I both couldn’t understand it and felt terrible about struggling. Despite the DM agreeing at that time, the plot I received was… not that.

I bring this up to explain that I had my character sprinting around the capital, trying to do as much as I could without impeding on the time of other players, desperate not to miss something. The DM was a big “your actions receive consequences!” guy (foreshadowing), so I knew I needed to try and do as much as I could to avoid the worst of his plot-punishment.

Rogue’s player had told me multiple times out of game that Rogue could help in fending off the genocide and the army laying siege to the capital. Rogue and my character had gotten off to a rocky start – trashing her entire culture and all – so I’d thought “Great, a chance to bond!” and agreed to it readily. I was wrong.

I believe no less than three times my Drow asked Rogue to his face, in increasing degrees of straightforwardness, if he had any way he could assist me. He always either said no, or something incredibly vague. One time in specific I remember he asked my Drow to meet him outside the council room and said he could help. When I asked something like “Oh? What can do you? Are you into finances or military affairs or something?” he proceeded to I think either get insulted, or offered nothing helpful. Knowing I was under an incredibly unforgiving time crunch, I said something like “If you can’t help me, I’m needed somewhere else”.

Rogue nor his player liked this response.

Things proceeded, again, to get worse.

In my opinion and in the opinion of the party members who are still my friends, Rogue became more and more hostile. I won’t say my Drow was nice, but she was at least amicable unless provoked, and whenever he insulted her I insulted him back. As I came to realise, these insults were incredibly common, to the point where I would avoid Rogue as best I could to avoid them in turn. In my eyes, our characters' interactions never brought anything but tension, insults, and hurt feelings. Despite this, his disparaging comments about any and all things Drow continued, both in and out of my character’s earshot. No lie, he once insulted the Drow capital/culture for not having essentially a Starbucks-level coffee (vanilla with two pumps of caramel or something similarly ridiculous for a fairly medieval-based low-magic campaign) available for him upon demand.

Time went on and I became increasingly more stressed out over my situation in game. It seemed as though no matter what I did, I was either insulted by Rogue or an NPC (in and out of earshot, despite the DM insisting the NPCs liked my character and were my friends), or punished in some way. I learnt much later that the plot was designed for the party to visit the front lines of the war, a whole six hours away, but seeing as the DM had emphasised the hour-by-hour nature of the plot, the party agreed to stay in the capital, since as it seemed as though much of the plot was occurring around us. In fact, it seemed to us as though the DM was encouraging us to stay, and discouraging us from travelling.

Over time, I reached out to the DM (again, a very good friend at the time who I trusted with almost anything), explaining that I was really stressed out about the campaign, and I felt as though I was playing ‘wrong’ and ruining the plot. They assured me that I wasn’t, and that there wasn’t any ‘correct’ path to take; that all options had their downsides. One message I still have from them, screenshotted and saved to my phone to make me feel better between sessions in my doubt, read “I don’t have any criticisms for how you’re playing \_character\_ I think you’re doing really good”. No matter how many times I asked for reassurance or a firmer guiding hand, they replied in this manner.

This, as I later learnt from a fellow player, was a lie.

While the DM was telling me I had nothing to improve and that I was doing great, he was supposedly making it quite clear to everyone else that I was ruining the plot, not playing as I should, and actively fucking it up for everyone else. Funnily enough, the DM told me *another* player was saying this about me, not them, so that was another lie. More so, at one point they discussed with me certain directions for the plot to take, to which I said I really liked one in particular. In reply they said, “Let's do it”. When I proceeded in game to strive for that plot, my character was shut down and made fun of; quite literally an NPC made fun of her stupidity for maybe forty whole minutes right at the start of the next session. Out of game, the DM was making fun of me as well, complaining that I had made such a clearly stupid decision. This, as well as our friends' trust in the DM, had them disliking me, too, and blaming me for how the plot was progressing. But I didn’t find this out until after I quit, so let's move on.

As the plot progressed, playing DND was having an active impact on my mental health. For 3+ hours a day, multiple times a week (we played very frequently), I had to sit on a Discord call and listen to “Bard is so stupid” and “Bard isn't very good” and “yeah she’s a bit of an idiot” and much worse, often said so quickly after complimenting me that it gave me emotional whiplash. Of course, the players and NPCs were talking about my character, not me, but when I was trying my absolute best to make the best decisions for the campaign and those actions were actively shit on, it didn’t feel very good. I’m ashamed to say there were multiple times I, while muted, cried during DND because of the impact of it all (which the DM knew). It came to a point where I was downright *afraid* to play, to act in game in fear of doing something criticism-worthy, and I often took out my headphones when certain players or NPCS mentioned my character’s name so I wouldn’t have to hear them shit on her (my) actions.

My mental health (until very recently! Thanks modern medicine!) had never been the best, and I knew DND was bringing me to a dangerous place. Multiple times I asked the DM to please instruct the players (Rogue in particular) to lay off a bit on the insults and the bashing, as it wasn’t doing me well. They seemed to agree, and the campaign continued on. Multiple times, I brought up perhaps needing a break, but again, I was told I was doing fine.

It got worse.

Multiple times, myself and Rogue’s player tried to talk through our conflict, saying stuff like “I did A because of B” or “I’m sorry for saying A, I said it because of C”, and each conversation, in my opinion, ended with a promise to try and do better. We both just wanted the conflict to be over with. In hindsight, I now realise I was simply putting up with essentially abuse because I didn’t want to make anyone upset, and due to some past experiences believed I must be wrong, because, well, Rogue’s player and the DM were my friends.

Nothing, and I mean *nothing¸* helped. In fact, it seemed to only get worse.

As it turned out, Rogue was *totally and completely* fine with my character’s entire people being genocided. He stated multiple times that he was “eager to leave (the drow homeland)” while my character was stressing about how to get her people to see the next day, and still actively shitted on everything related to her. It turned out he was perhaps romantically involved with the leading warrior who had come to kill my character’s people, and had further connections with the possible mastermind behind it – though, of course, even when directly questioned he refused to reveal anything. Rogue was very much a “consequences for thee but not for me” person, which I’m sure you’re all familiar with. This manifested itself with, predictably, stating “It's what my character would do!” about attacking people, insulting them, not helping the plot or the party, and being a racist, genocide-supporting dick. Quite funnily, one time the party (out of game) described Rogue as violent (he threw a dead body in the ocean, just tried to stab a party member that session, and made various other violent acts and threats to NPCs and party members alike), to which the player threw a hissy fit and said we just didn’t understand him – not that they would let us.

Despite Rogue’s insane stats and near invulnerability (because of course), my character was still essentially second in command in the Drow homeland – I knew I could have easily “It's what my character would do”d the Rogue and have the mysterious, genocide-supporting, assassin, racist, incredibly suspicious man thrown into the dungeons. But I didn’t, because that’s a fucking insane thing to do to another player (foreshadowing). I tried my best to be civil, tried to toe the line between believable character acting and doing what was best for the party, and tried to succeed in my plot while having some fun.

Still, nothing helped.

An annoying habit that kept occurring was that Rogue liked to take part in his own secretive plots, inviting none of the party, because I guess “that’s what my character would do”. Except, whenever someone else tried to do their own sensitive plots – especially my own – his player did not like it. One time, when Rogue asked to tag along with my character to see the vulnerable Empress (again, genocide-supporting, racist, asshole Rogue), my character said it was “none of his business”. His player then proceeded to act very upset in chat. This was incredibly strange considering in a session prior Paladin had asked Rogue if he wanted to see something (a very obvious plot hook) and for literally no reason Rogue then proceeded to go off at them, claiming the Paladin just wanted to be alone with the Empress (in the room) and insinuated they wanted to do something bad (even though the plothook was in an entirely different part of the capital?). Confused, Paladin said something like “Okay fine you don’t have to come!” and the two of them proceeded to get into an argument, one which Rogue claimed Paladin started when another party member asked them to stop. So, either way, included or not included, Rogue nor his player were ever happy.

Another time, my Bard tried to counterspell Rogue’s not-a-god-not-boyfriend (the DMPC, by total coincidence) from being magically kidnapped. Without explanation, Rogue tackled my character to the ground and hit her with his instant-paralysis-hallucinogenic knife, rendering her immobile for multiple hours. There was no save, just a roll on my end to determine the effects and the length of its duration. It was *unavoidable.* “Just trust me” he’d said, and I, clearly having no other choice, had to comply (entirely paralysed, of course). It turns out something terrible would have happened if my counterspell had succeeded – as in, not-a-god-not-boyfriend would have blown up the entire palace in his death – but this was never explained to anyone, especially me, not before, during, or after. While Rogue needed an in-depth explanation or justification to do anything the party asked of him (and perhaps not even then), Rogue never deemed any explanation to the party members worthwhile, insisting “trust me” was enough (this will come up again later).

Another time, Rogue attempted to steal a plot-important item from the Paladin, stealthing into their room, waking them up, and arguing with them to give him the item though downright refusing to state why. When Paladin understandably refused to, Rogue tried to steal it from them instead, which did not go over well with Paladin nor their player.

Rogue’s player also had a horrible habit of entering private chats with other players and metagaming, telling them what to do. One time my character interacted with a locked door, and without pause Rogue’s player texted me “HINT. KNOCK” (my character had the spell), and proceeded to get upset when I did not take her advice.

The only semi-friendly interaction Rogue and Bard shared was when Rogue FINALLY agreed to help my character regarding, oh you know, the upcoming genocide. This manifested in Rogue helping with the letter Bard wanted to send to the enemy leader, asking for a compromise. However, despite me clearly saying something akin to “this is a very quick draft, I’m sure I spelt things wrong, please ignore them for now”, Rogue’s player made it *very well known* that Rogue fixed all her spelling mistakes in a very snarky manner in this draft and every one after. Clearly, they just could not ignore the chance to shit on my Bard.

Later, I *again* went to the DM, asking if they could please tell Rogue’s player to stop shitting on the Drow (and my character specifically) and I think I also brought up how overpowered I felt Rogue to be. I know probably should have gone to the player first, but I cannot state how much I trusted the DM as my friend, and didn’t want to get into an argument with Rogue’s player over his actions, which had happened before. They agreed and sent my request to a group chat that I wasn’t in.

In the next session, Rogue proceeded to shit on the Drow. Again.

I lost hope. I thought I was just being too sensitive, not understanding enough, that my mental health was just too bad. I thought, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it was my fault I was being treated so cruelly.

Eventually, after a scary personal moment after a particularly harsh session, I came to the DM and told them essentially “Hey, I think I need to quit”. The DM said they understood, but my plot would be finished in one or two more sessions, and they encouraged me to stay until then and see how I felt. They even said I could make a new character to still play, but the idea of playing with Rogue and not even being able to defend my current character from all the shitty things he’d say about her filled me with dread. Notably, Rogue’s plot was after the next, and thinking about being surrounded by his NPCS (some of which were present in mine and, you guessed it, insulted my character frequently) made me feel ill. But, I agreed, because I thought it would be easiest on the campaign that way, and readied myself.

Shit proceeded to hit the fucking fan.

It was revealed soon after that Rogue had killed my character’s sister – then revived her, and killed her, and revived her, and killed her, in some sick experimentation. He didn’t know it was my character’s sister to be fair, but in Drow culture being revived in any sense was, essentially, torturous and inhuman – it was actually a major point of my character’s personality. This fact was well known by everyone and had been for a long time. I knew that as soon as the party learnt this it was going to be a problem. Rogue had (in his backstory, mind you) essentially committed the ultimate sin against a Drow – my character’s sister no less.

If I chose to go the Rogue route (“It's what my character would do”) my character would have straight up killed him. But, again, that’s insane and wouldn’t have been helpful in the least, so over the next few days until the following session I tried the find the best route ahead.

The next session was my last.

Everything culminated in Rogue and my character standing in a room together and having a conversation. I brought up in passing how it was revealed how Rogue killed my sister, and his player muttered something like “Oh you want to do this now, okay”. Then, to my great surprise, he apologised (shittily but “I'm sorry” was uttered and that’s better than I expected), explaining that he didn’t know it was her sister or a drow, and that he had in a sense been forced to do it, and it was for the greater good for medical research. More so, he had “suffered already” for his actions, and when my character asked how, he “gestured to himself” (the session before he’d revealed himself to be part bird or something equally as strange, a reveal that had zero context (much less an explanation as to why it was a bad thing or that it was even the result of something bad) or build up because he never said anything to anyone ever).

Again, Rogue said to the Drow, who had just stopped a genocide/mass slavery upon her people specifically because of their race, that he had already suffered enough for effectively torturing her sister beyond death because he was part-bird/non-human…

I actually needed a moment to determine if he was serious.

He was.

I was gobsmacked by the audacity.

Still, I knew I had to respond as best I could, to try heal the rift between our characters and me and my friend. We had both agreed prior that we needed to set our characters’ integrities aside for the greater good of the party. I just wanted it to be over. But I couldn’t just sweep it all under the rug. It felt unfair. I didn’t want to communicate that Rogue and his player could step all over me like I was some one-time NPC and not a party member and long-time friend. So, I tried to meet the two in the middle.

My character said essentially that, while she didn’t accept Rogue’s apology, she knew there was nothing he could do to ever get her to accept one, so she wasn’t going to ask any great task of him (I believe prior Rogue had asked Bard “Do you want me to die? What could I possibly do to gain your forgiveness?” quite sarcastically). She had seen enough bad in the world, and she wanted it to be over. Rather than hold it against him, she (and I) were willing to put it behind them both as long as, and I quote, “You try to be a good person in the future. That’ll be enough”.

Again and again I had been told that Rogue had a gooey, soft core at the centre of his hard exterior. That he was kind on the inside, that through trauma he had been forced to be so callous (all by the DM of course, because Rogue sure as well didn’t admit as much). In my mind, I was extending Rogue and his player an olive branch – what he had done to my character was unforgivable, but I was willing to forget it if he tried to be good (he had supported the genocide of her people, the bar was in hell). And, perhaps with that promise made, our characters' friendship could be great arcs for them both.

According to my notes, Rogue’s response went something like;

“Are you done? You haven’t seen the horrors, you haven’t suffered… I don’t want your opinion, I want your forgiveness but I don’t need it, if you think I haven’t suffered enough then I don’t care”

There was more, I’m sure, but I remember sitting in stunned silence the entire time. I believe it went on for another minute and a half before Rogue stormed off and the session ended with quite literally everyone in stunned, shocked silence.

After maybe 10 seconds, the DM said, “Okay, let's end the session here”. Rogue’s player got off call first, and I got off second, confused and angry and fuming.

The DM, Paladin, Barbarian, and Druid were still in the Discord call, and one of them told me later that THEY ALL AGREED that Rogue had been the one to fuck up that conversation. Again, EVERYONE AGREED it was Rogue’s fault.

I immediately go to a friend and start venting, and together we speak it through and agree on how odd, cruel, and confusing it was for Rogue to have reacted like that.

Sometime later that same night, the DM came to me and said that Rogue’s player was “hurt”, and wanted to speak to me, saying she believed she had put character integrity aside while I hadn’t.

I, of course, found this take genuinely insane. However, again, she was my friend, and I wanted to do right by her. If there had been some miscommunication, if something hadn’t landed correctly, I wanted to see it put to rights.

And so, like an idiot, I agreed to be put into a group chat (text) with Rogue’s player, with the DM mediating. I no longer have access to this chat, but I did copy the messages, so I’ll try to summarise them as best I can. Keep in mind this entire conversation was maybe less than 15 texts total and happened over I think two days.

First, the DM said we were all here to sort it out, that both of us were saying the same thing (“I threw away character integrity while she didn’t”), and that we were both his most understanding players. He wanted us to first state what we intended by the conversation, so the other might understand. I went first, saying much of what I already have here, “I think I gave Rogue a really good path out, willing to put it all behind me,” ect ect.

Rogue’s player proceeded to respond with one thing; a meme, with a teary cat and a caption saying “Sorry I exist”.

Quite literally that was it.

The DM then came in sometime later saying it was his decision to retcon the conversation.

I agreed (reluctantly) but I asked for guidance on how to proceed in the future. In my opinion, I had tried being nice, I had tried being firm, I had tried many approaches to Rogue and none of them worked. I just wanted some guidance on how I should behave in the future so I could avoid this entire situation again.

Rogue’s player responded with a small essay (1000+ words I believe), which, among other things, attacked me and my mental health, claimed actions had consequences (wild coming from her), and said I was both doing the same thing and not being consistent enough? Ie “Some consistency would be nice”. She also claimed I had it out for Rogue since the start and could not comprehend why my character disliked him so much – please remember, *again*, that Rogue was totally okay with the genocide of her people and constantly insulted them, among other things.

I would try to find better quotes, but looking at the message makes me ill.

Finally, finally, I saw no path forward. I could no longer justify to myself staying in the campaign if “Hey what do I do in the future?” got a response like *that.*

I sent a short, paraphrased “I see no way of moving forward. I quit. Good luck in the campaign”, and left the DND chats.

The proceeding months brought with them some absolutely horrific events on behalf of the DM and Rogue’s player, and I no longer speak to them after experiencing such abuse. However, this is a DND horror story, and Rogue’s tale (and the DM’s complacency) don’t end here, so let's continue.

Here's my Daily Post on Reddit. That is it, people.

We are making adjustments to our new life in the East Bronx as the days are getting shorter. I still jog every day at 6:00 a.m. with the local running club. But they are so nice and pass by our house to pick me up so I won't have to walk alone to the park. Mom, Dad, Muma, or Pupa arrange to pick me up at the ferry or bus stop if I get home at dark. No more doormen. 

The five of us always have dinner together and we have a big pot of morning coffee in the vestibule to start the day. Mom it is working harder than ever but it is all home office. She does some corporate contract stuff but mostly local work now. She and Mackenzie have incorporated and my bedroom has been converted to their office. That's all right, being in the H&L apartment helps me not miss Lolita so much.

I've explained to Coach about the local runners group and she tells me that is much more important than coming in Zero Period for the team conditioning class. She believes in [glocalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glocalization?wprov=sfla1) and would like to see people do glocalized conditioning and sports rather than corporate gyms or watch professional sports.

Jammy is getting ready for 2 weeks of Halloween gigs. I think our opening song is incredible. I would say we are halfway finished on it. We took a German language song that a friend recommended to me and we are doing English lyrics. They are not translations, they are our own. [Das Alte Lied (The Old Song](https://youtu.be/0laWZ-_gLpo?si=9CP8oY1MnWTUmBWI)) has an amazing baseline that is perfect for Halloween and there are all types of intervals for Halloween shrieks and scary noise.

We have a game at 5:30 in Washington Heights. It will be a bummer getting home.

1g5pj0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberCupid/comments/1g5pj0c/best_dating_app_for_young_adults_lets_break_it/,Best Dating App for Young Adults? Let’s Break It Down,"Navigating the world of dating apps can be a mess, especially if you're a young adult trying to find something real. With so many apps out there, it’s like, where do you even start? Whether you're just here for a fun time or you're lowkey trying to meet someone special, there's a dating app that’s probably right for you. Let's keep it real—here’s a rundown of the best dating apps for young adults and why you might want to give ‘em a try.

**Tinder: Swipe Right for Fun (or More?)**

Tinder's been around forever, right? It’s simple: swipe right if you’re into someone, swipe left if you’re not. You can build your profile with photos, a short bio, even link your Spotify. The whole location-based matching means you’re more likely to meet someone nearby, which can be great if you want to actually meet up.

Yeah, most people think it’s a “hookup” app, but don’t sleep on Tinder—plenty of people have found real relationships here. My friend Sarah? She met her fiancé through mutual love for indie music on Tinder. Who says swiping can’t lead to something real?

**Best Dating App for Young Adults** who want a straightforward, fast-paced experience with tons of options.

**Bumble: Ladies First**

If you’re tired of waiting for someone else to make the first move, Bumble’s where it’s at. Women message first, and they’ve got 24 hours to do it, or the match disappears. No pressure, right? For LGBTQ+ users, you can choose who messages first, which makes the app feel super inclusive.

Bumble also has extra stuff—like Bumble BFF if you’re just looking for friends or Bumble Bizz if you need networking connections. But let’s be real, you’re probably here for the dating. It’s all about giving you control over the convo, which can be a game changer.

**Best Dating App for Young Adults** who want to take charge or just switch things up from the usual.

**Hinge: Get Ready to Delete It**

Hinge literally brands itself as “the app designed to be deleted,” and if you're looking for something deeper, this one’s probably for you. You fill out prompts, post pics, and share voice notes—so you’re getting to know more about someone than just what they look like.

You can like specific parts of someone’s profile (that pic of their trip to Japan, for example), which makes it easier to start convos. Their matching algorithm actually tries to pair you with someone you’re compatible with, not just random swipes. I know a couple that bonded over their shared love for cooking through Hinge. Now they’re happily married.

**Best Dating App for Young Adults** who want something more serious without the endless swiping.

**OkCupid: Let's Get Detailed**

OkCupid is all about answering questions and showing off your personality. You can customize your profile way more than on most other apps, and the app uses your answers to match you based on compatibility. No more swiping through people with completely different values—this app tries to save you time and energy.

People looking for a serious relationship will feel right at home. Plus, there are tons of prompts to make sure you can share more than just a photo.

**Best Dating App for Young Adults** who care more about personality and values than just photos.

**Coffee Meets Bagel: Less Swiping, More Connecting**

Not into the whole swiping thing? Coffee Meets Bagel sends you a match (called a “bagel”) every day at noon, and you can either chat or pass. It’s a bit more low-key compared to other apps, focusing on quality over quantity. This is great if you don’t want to waste time swiping through endless profiles.

Most of the users on this app are looking for something real, not just casual hookups. It’s perfect for young professionals who are too busy to swipe endlessly but still want a meaningful connection.

**Best Dating App for Young Adults** who value deeper connections and don’t want to spend hours swiping.

Whether you’re here for something casual or looking for the real deal, there’s an app for you. Tinder’s got you if you want something fast and fun, Bumble gives you the power to make the first move, and Hinge is all about finding that deep connection. OkCupid lets you match based on values, and Coffee Meets Bagel helps you find something meaningful without endless swiping.

I decided to go to much celebrated hyped cafe ‘Botanica Osteria’ in  Rajpur Road, Dehradun to have coffee with a Freind. 

I won’t go into how their coffee and service was cause that’s not my concern right now.  

So we ordered coffee from the menu and water bottle. (Normal Vedic was the brand) 

Now coffee price is obviously stated in the menu and water bottle obviously was not! Vaise bhi by general rule it goes with MRP. 

Koi baat nahi 

We finished their sub standard coffee and waited for very long for server to come with the bill (we also waited for very long so that the server could take our order) 

Since we were getting late, I went directly to cashier to pay. I look into the bill and there was this separate bill for water bottle somehow!  

131 rs! To be precise with taxes and GST 

I asked him politely ‘I think there is a printing mistake here’ 

The manager said ‘Itna ka bikta hai’ like very rudely! I remember his face clearly kyuki he had hazel eyes and was fair and he rolled his eyes to give me a look 

I immediately asked me ‘What’s the MRP of the bottle?’ 

‘Water bottle branded hai, itna ka hi dete hai vaise bhi Cafe RAJPUR ROAD PAR HAI!’ 

I immediately checked the bottle MRP and it was 60 rs.  

I was furious cause agar tumhari aukat nahi hai Rajpur road pe cafe kholne ki to khola kyu 

Or khola hi hai to ehsaan Kia mujh pe??!!! 

I simply asked them overcharging ki bhi had hoti hai 60 ki bottle hai 80 ka kar deta 

WTF is 131!!! That too with extra taxes on it! 

It’s not about 131 rs but what is fair and and what is not! Especially the attitude he was giving me! 

He didn’t do shit! UNTILL I actually called him ye bill jaa raha hai consumer court! 
See you then! 


He immediately snatched the bill from my hand and wrote 60 rs and remaining money he literally threw on the table in anger! 


Now recently my other friend went there and same shit happened to her!! I freakin lost my mind! 

You guys I don’t know why I am writing this! But I thought after my interaction they would have improved their services. Seems they are simply simply low life scums again doing the same with general public

Told her about it a while later, she was speechless. When I asked her If she was willing to go on a date sometime in the future however, she agreed. After that I didn't press the topic further as to figure things out for myself.

Since then she hasn't distanced herself from me, instead our conversations are more frequent and lengthy, especially as of late.

We were always very emotionaly intimate as in we talked about pretty much everything and hugging is pretty normal as well.

These last couple conversations however she started to initiate talking points way more on her own and texting went on for hours on end. Additionally she started asking me about difficult descisions in her work life. We work in the same field, however she is essentially my senior and she never did this before, usually helping me out.
Things like ""You'll be my deciding vote"" and such, which leads to long discussions about our responsibilities in the field, ethics and anxieties and such. Like that's work related, but answering those questions quickly becomes deeply personal, so If she intends to or not, she got to know me even better on some pretty heavy topics.
Also she has colleagues and close friends with as much if not more experience then herself, instead of me who is only getting started.

In our last meeting (which I did not consider a date, I haven't asked her yet) she told me at the end, that the last few months I've been beaming, while smiling directly at me. In that moment I kinda cracked and fumbled for words. I didn't really respond, though I think my feelings are pretty obvious.
I've been through some drastic change in that time, losing roughly 55lbs and advancing my carreer. 

She knows that what jumstarted the change was me catching feelings for her, I told her that from from the start. Though she could of course just be happy for me in general.

On that evening she also asked me to attend a party she was hosting. I had to decline due to another event, to which she replied with the Idea of hosting a second party.
When she invited me again to said 1st party a couple days ago, I told her I could attend for a short while, but I could also come over earlier and help her prepare (mostly cooking). She agreed with thanks but said we could also just go for some coffee at her place. Which again could mean something or nothing at all.

Like I know there is nothing specific, but I thought me telling her I have feelings for her would drastically change our dynamic, either her distancing herself from me or getting a bit flirty, I guess. Instead our relationship furthered in an unspecified direction in which we are even more emotionaly intimate with each other.

I know that she was in a long term relationship until last year, in which lack of emotional intimacy was kind of the nail in the coffin. 

In discussion on the topic we both agreed, that we do not want to lose each other, so I could understand her being cautious, but it could also just be her going with what's pretty natural to us.

At some point I moved away and he eventually moved near my hometown.  Several years later I also relocated to my hometown.  We hung out and I found out he had a girlfriend.  We ended up hooking up, and he had so much anxiety about it that he and I stopped talking.  

A few years later I reached out.  We started chatting and met at a coffee shop to catch up.  He was still with the same girlfriend.  He said their relationship was very much like roommates.  They have separate rooms and do not even kiss.  So this slowly turned into us hanging at my house and eventually hooking up.

We sporadically see each other maybe once every 6 months and hook up for the next few years.  I am always talking to him about wanting to date, how much I like him and how I still haven’t found anyone I like more than him (tho I have tried).  

So now it’s been 15 years since we have known each other.  He is 44 and I am 38.  I invite him over and he tells me they are getting married—but just on paper for Power of Attorney (medical decisions) type reasons.  I start crying and tell him not to, that I want to be with him.  He had told me he would never get married because his parents are divorced, etc.  I suggest just doing Power of Attorney papers and not getting married—he says he will do that.  He also told me her name for the first time (at least I believe so) and that she told him he has permission to get sex elsewhere, but she doesn’t want to know about it.  He says that he does love her and has such bad anxiety and that she’s the only one who would put up with how much space he needs, etc.  I tell him I also require space.  My social battery is drained through social interactions and then I have to have time to re-charge.

So now my mind has been wondering if he told me that as a cry for help.  Is he wanting me to find her and tell her about us?  Why would he share this with me?  I found her Facebook page (or at least what used to be it) and am so tempted to ask her myself if she really gave him permission to have sex outside of the relationship, etc.  

I am in love with him and would do anything to be with him.  I don’t want to give him an ultimatum, but have been thinking about it ever since he told me about the marriage plan.  He also has a low sex drive (as do I) but I cant see him cutting off sex completely.  I plan on telling him I am in love with him if/when he agrees to see me again.

I have also been contemplating:
(1) Should I reach out to her?
(2) Should I tell him he has to tell her about us or I will?

My biggest fear is that I will lose all contact with him.",1,1729167048.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
