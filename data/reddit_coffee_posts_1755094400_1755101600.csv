1mp8g8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mp8g8j/find_out_if_the_best_espresso_machine_by_chulux/,Find Out if the Best Espresso Machine by CHULUX Delivers Quality,"Testing the CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 daily over the past few weeks has definitely been a delightful experience. This compact espresso machine caught my attention with its appealing stainless steel exterior and modern design. It promises professional-grade coffee-making features in a sleek form factor that fits snugly into small kitchens or office spaces. With its impressive specifications like a 20-bar pressure pump and a powerful milk frother, this machine aims to deliver caf√©-quality beverages at home. However, as much as I appreciated its multiple offerings, there are a few points to keep in mind.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that stands out is how slim and compact this machine is. Measuring just 5.6 inches wide, it occupies minimal countertop space, which is a boon for people like me with limited kitchen real estate. Its metallic finish enhances the overall aesthetic, making it look premium and modern. The layout of buttons and controls feels intuitive, making it easy to start brewing right out of the box. What I enjoyed most was its ease of cleaning‚Äîboth the drip tray and the water tank are removable, simplifying maintenance after each use. Small details like these really make it beginner-friendly.

**Features That Deliver**

As a coffee enthusiast, I‚Äôm always drawn to features that promise rich, flavorful brews. The 20-bar precision pressure pump does a fantastic job. By pre-soaking the coffee grounds at low pressure and slowly ramping up to high pressure, the machine extracts the maximum aroma and flavor. I found my espressos to be well-balanced with a noticeable reduction in acidity, which is great for anyone sensitive to overly bitter coffee. The built-in PID system, which maintains water temperature consistently within the 170-185¬∞F range, ensures the brewing process is stable. It also preheats the cups on the top, a small but thoughtful touch to enhance the coffee-drinking experience.

**Performance and Usability**

What impressed me the most was the performance-to-size ratio of this machine. The 1350W instant heating system preheats in under 30 seconds. Plus, it can extract a single or double shot of espresso within 20-30 seconds. I tested it with different types of coffee grounds, and the machine had no trouble delivering consistent results every time. The semi-automatic operation mode gave me just the right amount of control, allowing for quick, hassle-free cups of espresso while also feeling involved in the process. The system might appeal to both casual users and budding at-home baristas.

**Upsides**

- Slim and stylish design fits compact spaces perfectly
- Consistent espresso extraction with the 20-bar pressure pump
- Built-in PID temperature control ensures stable brewing
- Compatible with single and double-shot filters
- Convenient, removable drip tray and water tank for easy cleaning

**Powerful Milk Frother**

After getting the espresso right, the next big test for me was the milk frother. I often make lattes or cappuccinos, and the frother did not disappoint. It produces creamy, rich microfoam, perfect for latte art or simply texturing milk for frothy beverages. Additionally, its hot water function proved handy for preparing an Americano or even steeping tea. However, using the frother requires a bit of practice, especially if you‚Äôve never used one before. Be patient, and you‚Äôll get the foam texture just right.

**Areas for Improvement**

- No built-in grinder means pre-ground beans or a separate grinder is necessary
- Slightly noisy, especially during milk frothing
- Compared to larger machines, the 40oz water reservoir might feel limiting for heavy users

**Competing Brands**

In its price range, the CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 faces stiff competition from products like the Breville Bambino and De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica Deluxe. While both competitors offer similarly compact designs and reliable espresso brewing, this machine‚Äôs 20-bar pressure pump provides better extraction in certain cases. The milk frother on the Breville is generally easier to handle for beginners, but CHULUX delivers a comparable result once you get the technique down. However, it lacks a built-in grinder, something you‚Äôll find on higher-end models like Breville Barista Express.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Buying espresso machines is often a balancing act between features and cost, but I‚Äôd call this one smart spending. The CHULUX machine delivers impressive performance and features at a cost that's far lower than many high-end models, making it a good value for at-home coffee enthusiasts who want quality without breaking the bank. For people like me who enjoy caf√©-quality drinks but don't want the complexity or bulk of professional machines, this compact option strikes the right chord.

1mp8frp,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1mp8frp/are_the_word_of_wisdom_verses_1215_eat_meat/,"Are the Word of Wisdom verses 12-15  (Eat meat sparingly, consume only in times of winter, or cold, or famine)  currently taught and studied deeply in church correlated educational materials?  Why are these verses completely ignored by members?","Taking a deep dive into the implementation of part of the Word of Wisdom (Doctrine and Covenants 89).  The convoluted interpretation of the prohibitions against ""hot drinks"" that we are all familiar with are humorous  (no hot or ICED) coffee or tea (if made from the Camellia sinensis plant), herbal teas such as peppermint tea OK, hot chocolate (even with non-coffee energy shots) OK, caffeine OK (if not in coffee or tea) caffeinated sodas OK, Red Bull OK, caffeine pills (available over the counter in the US) OK. Ultimately the interpretation of the ""hot drinks"" rules are all about keeping control over the members under the guise of ""obedience"" and having a righteousness identity marker to the larger society at larger.  

But what about WoW verses 12-15?  These seems to be systematically ignored (or even unknown) by virtually all TBMs that I know. I don't think most members have even read the entire WoW. Seems like typical cherry picking of the ""scriptures"" to me.  But yet, the temple recommend question is  ""Do you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?"" 

I know Russell M. Nelson (former heart surgeon) wrote and spoke about keeping the WoW, but did he ever speak or write specifically as a prophet or apostle about eating meat (or saturated fats or processed food) sparingly?  I think as a heart surgeon he would have actually have opinions on the issue.

I copied this off multiple already existing Devilboo AUs, and I‚Äôm very sure there‚Äôs already a Kaimiku Devilboo AU out there‚Ä¶ but anyway.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Miku, an aspiring chef who often invents unusual (and often tummy-upset-inducing) recipes.

She wonders why nobody likes her cooking, but doesn‚Äôt let that demoralize her and continues to work to improve her recipes, while still keeping them ‚ÄúMiku‚Äù.

However, those who were brave enough to agree to be taste-testers to her work often magically lose their hunger after a single bite, and she‚Äôs often forced to store her leftovers in the fridge for a few days before throwing them out, to be used as fertilizer or other stuff.

One day, though, when she opens her fridge to take out the vanilla ice cream garlic bread she‚Äôd made the other day‚Äî she finds it missing, with every bit of crumb or cream licked off the plate.

And a note, saying ‚ÄúThank you for the food :)‚Äù in nearly illegible chicken scratch handwriting.

From that point on, any dish she made with ice cream, or chocolate, or anything sweet‚Äî or coffee‚Äî disappeared from her fridge without a trace, leaving only the crockery it had sat in. Miku was happy someone was finally eating her food, but miffed at the same time that they just took it without asking!

So she made a plan to catch the culprit in the act. She made the dish that the culprit took on the first night‚Äî vanilla ice cream garlic bread, but this time with a bit of coffee sauce for toppings, and hid in wait behind the fridge. Unfortunately, she‚Äôd nodded off, but woken up just in time to see the culprit snarfing down her kind-of dessert at the dinner table, licking the last bits of crumbs and cream off the plate‚Ä¶

She snuck up from behind as quietly as she could with her furry slippers on‚Ä¶ and stepped on a creaky floorboard.

The culprit whirls around, and they both come face to face; both freeze, completely taken by surprise.

He had weirdly-shaped eyes and ears, and donned a bizarre outfit that looked like it came from 5 centuries back.

Both stare at each other open-mouthed until the tension grows so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Why does Miku feel her face heating up?

‚Äú‚Ä¶I-I‚Äôm sorry!!‚Äù

The other disappears in a poof of strange blue sparkles, and Miku is left in the kitchen with not only an empty plate, but a short-circuiting mind and a loud, embarrassing thought:

**[ Why is he‚Ä¶ so cute????? ]**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Oh yeah, Kaito had the exact same thought about Miku as well and both proceeded to question practically everything after that event. And in the end Kaito kept coming back to the kitchen to eat what Miku left for him‚Ä¶ but Miku is waiting at the fridge one night and sighs and goes ‚ÄúYou could have just asked nicely‚Ä¶‚Äù

Kaito, on first observation, looks like he could smite you just by looking at you. But he‚Äôs actually just a huge goofball with an even huger weakness for anything sweet, and coffee. 

Miku eventually tells Kaito about how nobody likes her cooking, and that she‚Äôs surprised Kaito keeps eating it. 

Kaito reveals that actually, he hadn‚Äôt liked any human‚Äôs cooking until he tasted Miku‚Äôs, and that he loves what she makes the best! Miku is surprised, but secretly indulges in the validation this brings her‚Ä¶ and she‚Äôs motivated to cook more, sometimes just for Kaito himself.

And then they slowly but unknowingly fall for each other as Kaito comes to Miku‚Äôs house more and more, talking to each other, playing games together, Kaito sometimes even helping her in the kitchen (and making even MORE hell food together‚Ä¶)",2,1755100728.0,PjskSimpBattles,0,1.0,False
1mp8com,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mp8com/why_is_the_best_singleserve_brewer_nespresso/,Why is the best single-serve brewer Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima worth it,"If you're anything like me and take your coffee seriously, then the Nespresso ENV300B Vertuo Lattissima might catch your eye. I‚Äôve spent the past few weeks putting this coffee maker through its paces, and it‚Äôs been quite the experience. From cappuccinos to iced lattes, this machine seems determined to turn even the groggiest mornings into a joy-filled beverage ritual. That said, there‚Äôs plenty to unpack here, so let‚Äôs dive in.

**Sleek Design with a Functional Edge**  
The first thing that struck me about the Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima is the compact yet modern design. It‚Äôs minimalistic but manages to command attention on the countertop, blending seamlessly into my kitchen decor. Measuring 16"" deep, 7.5"" wide, and 12.4"" tall, it‚Äôs also space-conscious, which is a blessing for smaller kitchens or cramped countertops. The detachable milk frother is not only a nice visual touch but also screams practicality. It‚Äôs dishwasher safe, so cleaning up after a creamy cappuccino isn‚Äôt nearly as frustrating as I anticipated.

**The One-Touch Magic Button**  
Single-button operation might sound gimmicky, but trust me‚Äîit really simplifies things in the morning rush. This coffee maker heats up in just 30 seconds, so impatient caffeine lovers (like me) won‚Äôt have to twiddle their thumbs too long. It even includes a descaling alert, which is a nice touch and something I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I became paranoid about old coffee residue ruining my brews.

[Check Nespresso ENV300B price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0c5kf8yk7/)  

**Versatility at Its Best**  
One thing I can‚Äôt stop raving about is how versatile this machine is. It offers multiple coffee formats, including 5, 8, 12, and 18 fl. oz. coffees alongside single and double espressos. Whether it‚Äôs a simple espresso shot to power through work deadlines or a large cup of rich coffee to relax on Sundays, the machine‚Äôs flexibility is delightful. Toss in the fact that it can brew over ice, and it‚Äôs ideal for those summer iced coffee kicks.

**Key Benefits**  
- Perfect for coffee fans who love variety: cappuccino, latte, espresso, iced coffee‚Äîit's all here.  
- The milk frother is detachable and super easy to clean.  
- Faster than you‚Äôd expect, with a 30-second heat-up time.  
- The adjustable drip tray ensures it can handle mugs of various sizes.  

**Compatibility Could Be Limiting**  
The machine exclusively works with Nespresso Vertuo pods, which might limit your choices compared to other systems. While Nespresso has a decent variety (over 40 permanent specialty coffees and rotating limited-edition blends), you‚Äôre locked into using their capsules. For someone like my coworker who loves experimenting with third-party coffee grounds or reusable pods, this might feel restrictive or expensive in the long run.

**Negatives**  
- Capsule dependency could feel limiting for some users.  
- The overall structure feels sturdy, but the plastic components like the drip tray seem prone to scratches.  
- Milk frothing, while convenient, isn‚Äôt as customizable as what advanced espresso machines allow.  

**Sustainability Efforts**  
A surprising highlight of the Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima was its commitment to recycling. As someone trying to be a tiny bit less wasteful in my daily habits, I appreciated that the Nespresso pods are recyclable through their free program. Sure, it‚Äôs not a fix-all for the environmental concerns around single-use coffee pods, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

**Product Comparisons**  
As much as I adore this coffee maker, I couldn't resist comparing it to competitors like Keurig K-Caf√© and Breville Bambino. The Nespresso definitely outshines them in terms of espresso quality and crema, thanks to the exclusive pod technology. However, Keurig takes the edge in versatility when it comes to non-coffee drinks and the ability to use regular coffee grounds. Breville caters more to espresso purists with its emphasis on manual espresso preparation, but it lacks the convenience and speed of the Vertuo Lattissima.

**Financial Value**  
Looking at the features this machine crams into a surprisingly compact design, it feels like solid value for money. You‚Äôre essentially paying for an all-in-one system that delivers quality with minimal effort. That said, if you‚Äôre adding up the cost of purchasing exclusively Nespresso capsules, it could get pricey over time. This makes it a better fit for those who prioritize convenience over long-term cost-effectiveness.

1mp8cgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1mp8cgw/explore_the_best_overear_headphones_sony/,Explore the best over-ear headphones Sony MDR-ZX110AP worth it,"Test-driving the Sony MDR-ZX110AP headphones has been an interesting journey for me as a self-proclaimed audiophile and part-time gamer. These headphones have a unique set of strengths that cater to various needs, but they also come with some quirks worth discussing. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about these headphones was how lightweight they are. At just 4.2 ounces, they feel incredibly portable and perfect for someone who is always on the go, like me. The swiveling earcup design makes them even easier to stash in my bag without taking up precious room. While the build is predominantly plastic, which might not scream premium, the materials used feel sturdy enough for everyday handling. I‚Äôve thrown them in my gym bag a few times, and they came out unscathed. The cushioned earpads offer decent comfort for shorter listening sessions, though extended use can make them feel a tad snug if you have a larger head, like my friend discovered during a road trip. 

**Audio Performance**  
Plugging the Sony MDR-ZX110AP headphones into my phone was a solid audio experience right from the start. These headphones deliver a punchy, rhythmic output, courtesy of their 30mm neodymium dynamic drivers. I listened to bass-heavy tracks and subtle acoustic numbers; the headphones handled them with decent precision. The frequency range from 12 Hz to 22 kHz allows for deep bass and clear highs, though audiophiles might notice the mids could use a bit more depth. Compared to many other budget-friendly headphones, they managed to push detailed sound without the need for excessive volume adjustments. 

[Check Sony MDR-ZX110AP price on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b00nbr6rds/)  

**Usability and Features**  
These headphones are made for versatility. From gaming and exercising to simply zoning out on a train ride with your favorite tunes, they cater to a broad range of activities. The in-line remote with a built-in microphone makes hands-free phone calls seamless. I tested this feature during a gaming session‚Äîit allowed me to take an impromptu work call without having to juggle devices. That said, the lack of noise cancellation is noticeable in busier environments. The sound isolation is functional but not mind-blowing, so you might hear the background chatter in a coffee shop if your music isn‚Äôt turned up. Also, the 1.2-meter cable is adequate for everyday use but feels slightly limiting if you‚Äôd like more mobility for tasks like exercising.  

**Benefits**  
The Sony MDR-ZX110AP comes with a pocket-friendly combination of features that are worth highlighting:

- Swiveling earcups enhance portability and storage convenience.  
- Punchy performance from the 30mm dynamic drivers.  
- Wide frequency range offers flexibility across music genres.  

**Negative Attributes**  
However, no product is perfect, and these headphones have a few less favorable aspects:

- Ear cushioning can feel tight after extended use.  
- Lack of active noise cancellation detracts from use in noisy places.  
- Cable length limits freedom of movement in certain situations.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to alternatives like the JBL TUNE 500 or Sennheiser HD 206, the Sony MDR-ZX110AP holds its ground well in the budget segment. For instance, the JBL TUNE 500 offers slightly better bass response but lacks the swiveling earcup design, which makes Sony a better pick for portability. Meanwhile, Sennheiser‚Äôs HD 206 stands out for its slightly superior build quality. However, it doesn‚Äôt come with an in-line remote or microphone, which the Sony MDR-ZX110AP includes, making it a viable choice for those who prioritize hands-free capabilities.  

**Price Performance**  
In terms of cost-efficiency, these headphones definitely deliver a reasonable return on the investment. The balance between audio quality, portability, and useful features like the in-line remote adds to its appeal for those on a budget. If audiophile-grade performance isn‚Äôt a necessity, these headphones offer solid value. They might not rival premium headsets, but for casual listening, quick calls, or gaming sessions, they're solid performers for their price point.

* **Ship one thing they asked for every week.**

1mp8by4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1mp8by4/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_experience_with/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Experience with Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS,"Giving the Cuisinart Coffee Center SS-4N1NAS a test run felt like stepping into a caf√© every morning without leaving the house. This sleek black machine, with its compact appeal, promises a lot by dubbing itself as a ""4-in-1 Barista Bar."" Naturally, I had to see if it lived up to the hype, especially since I‚Äôm a coffee junkie who gets grumpy without my morning fix. Spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt disappoint, but boy, do I have a few things to say about it.

**Design and Build**  
The first thing that caught my eye was how stylish yet functional this machine looks. Its dimensions, sitting at 12""D x 13""W x 16.8""H, make it a reasonable fit on the kitchen counter without dominating too much space. The solid black finish gives it a modern vibe, blending in whether your kitchen aesthetic leans classic or contemporary. Built for versatility, the steam wand and carafe stole my attention right away. The wand, by the way, doubles as a hot water dispenser for teas, hot cereals, or even soup. That versatility ups the machine's game for multi-use purposes. However, at 14 pounds, it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd want to be moving around frequently. It is sturdy, though, and the weight lends itself to an air of durability. Still, a little more minimalism in design might've helped it fit even more snugly in smaller kitchens.  

**Performance That Hits Many Notes**
Using this coffee maker was like juggling a bunch of caffeinated options, and I mean that in the best way. The programmable drip brew option works like a charm. With customizable brewing strength and features like Brew Pause (this lets you sneak a cup mid-brew‚Äîhandy for impatient souls like me), making up to 12 cups of coffee feels straightforward. The single-serve settings, on the other hand, let me choose between 6 oz., 8 oz., or 10 oz. portions. Testing these, I found it brewed consistently across the sizes, and it‚Äôs compatible with most single-serve pods, including the Keurig K-Cups I already had lying around. Plus, my occasional short dive into Nespresso OriginalLine capsules proved equally enjoyable thanks to its built-in espresso functionality.  

[Check Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b0bwsmv57f/)

**Features You‚Äôll Appreciate**  
One big highlight for me was the milk frother. With its ability to craft cappuccinos and lattes, you can almost hear French caf√© music in the background as you froth milk to suit your morning needs. It's not just limited to coffee drinks either; hot chocolate enthusiasts in my family managed to get creative with it! The 24-hour programmability feature felt like a stroke of genius because I could set it the night before and wake up to the smell of perfectly brewed coffee. There's also an adjustable Keep Warm feature where it stays hot for up to 4 hours. As a parent juggling unpredictable mornings, this was an impressive lifesaver.  

**Winning Points**  
- Offers four brewing options in one compact machine.  
- Seamless compatibility with Keurig K-Cup and Nespresso pods.  
- Built-in milk frother doubles as a steam wand for hot beverages or soups.  
- Programmable drip coffee that accommodates up to 12 cups.
  
**Weaknesses**  
- The 14-pound weight might be cumbersome for anyone needing portability.  
- While versatile, certain other machines offer quieter operation.  
- Frother isn‚Äôt detachable, making cleanup a tad inconvenient.

**Other Options to Consider**  
When stacking it against alternatives like the Keurig K-Caf√© and the Nespresso VertuoPlus, the Cuisinart Coffee Center comes ahead by blending its versatility of pod-compatibility with large batch brewing capability, which both competitors don‚Äôt offer simultaneously. Keurig‚Äôs K-Caf√© excels in simplicity and offers a similar frothing experience but doesn‚Äôt shine when batch brewing is involved. On the other hand, Nespresso gives premium espresso experiences but misses the charm of making large, shared pots of coffee. This machine feels like a jack-of-all-trades, and while it doesn‚Äôt surpass the niche expertise of competitors, it bridges functionalities effectively.  

**Smart Spending**  
For what this machine offers‚Äîranging from customizable brewing, frothing capabilities, and programmable settings‚Äîit's hard to argue against the value it brings to the table. The addition of eco-friendly reusable filters saves ongoing costs previously spent on disposable ones. It strikes a balance between affordability and quality, making it a choice I imagine both budget-conscious buyers and coffee purists would appreciate. While not everyone needs the all-in-one package, if you‚Äôre someone who likes variety in your morning cup and enjoys playing a barista role from home, this fits the bill perfectly.

The baby never sleeps. So when Hintua doesn‚Äôt awaken, not even after the rice in coconut is cooked, her mother Nanitra is afraid. Suddenly she can smell the magic: a bitter metal thread and a powerful glamour. Hintua has been replaced with a changeling. Certain she will not be believed, Nanitra determines to go to alone to the Fell Mountain, where the ‚Äòfair folk‚Äô¬†are said to take the babies they steal. ¬†

Robbing her in-laws of the faceted jet discs that are the makings of magic, and taking tools for fighting monsters, she sets off. A monster who intends to drink her blood attacks her, but she compels him to her service‚Äîthe beautiful, devious Leofsige. Her childhood friend,¬†Liantaika, apprentice wizard to a brutal master, joins them, still hopeful in his hopeless love. In escaping he has stolen all his master‚Äôs charms, including the atsar bombs that promise vast destruction and poisoned aftermath.

Liantaika‚Äôs theft brings pursuers, wizards from the Academies desperate to recover the bombs. And so, as our trio leaves Nanitra‚Äôs home in the tropics behind to seek the Mountain, they face ever-more violent attacks. Some are absurd terror: Nanitra is pitched into scalding coffee with condensed milk, and only Liantaika‚Äôs magic saves her.

Worse, near-fatally wounded by a retiarius, Nanitra is healed in a vat of pink slime into something unwanted, a great beauty. She fears Hintua will not recognize her. Her fear is realized, but strangely, when they come to the Mountain after Liantaika‚Äôs sacrifice. All is different than Nanitra imagined: Leofsige whom she loves; Hintua and her captors; even the carelessly half-made world. These pale people are no Fae, but scientists trying to save a moon of silver hexes from destruction, and the world from winter.

FRAYMOON combines dark cities with a steely village girl: think China Mi√®ville meets Naomi Novik. Readers of Kelly Link‚Äôs¬†*White Cat, Black Dog,* and Alex Phebey‚Äôs¬†*Cities of the Weft* will appreciate remade fairy-tales, baleful and strange.

Thank you for your consideration,

Note: I have changed both this letter and the novel based on  feedback here. Thanks to the readers. Concerns: this is accurate but not punchy and does not reflect the novel's style. However, this is not the place for style? It covers the ending and I think the query should cover the first 2/3 or so. Is this a negative? Note on the text: the inciting incident of Nanitra discovering the changeling, her decision to go to the Fell Mountain, and her gathering materials and fleeing her village all occur in chapter one; it's swift from that point of view.

First 300 words: 

The baby never slept. Well, of course she slept sometimes, she was a living creature. Nanitra used to wonder, as she nursed her in the night, whether bugs slept also, being alive. The little things that caused disease, too small to see, they probably did not sleep. And fish? She wondered whether shrimp had dreams, nightmares of the dolphins‚Äô cheery smiles, the cone-like teeth, being flushed out onto the greasy black mud of the marsh, falling back into the creeks, inevitable. At the beginning Hintua had slept only forty-five minutes at a time, one could have set a clock, and then she nursed slowly. Nanitra was so not herself, leaking blood and milk like a gutted thing, that she was not even sad. But then, at three weeks, she had woken up enough to be tired, and to feel ground under the wheel of it. She began to think she would go mad, and no one could help her. Hintua would never drink milk from the soft cubes in the cold box, though it was Nanitra‚Äôs own milk, and warmed, and had a nipple. They even had the vicar come enchant them, but it was no use. And she was not permitted to use magic to make her sleep, though sometimes anguish pushed her to it.

Over time, as Nanitra had desperately hoped, the sleep grew longer, to two hours, but there it stopped, and now eleven months on that was still the longest Hintua would sleep. She sometimes deigned to eat rice porridge with chicken broth like a big girl, and this should bring sleep, but then she turned her head away from the spoon one direction and the other, her high brow stubborn, her great black eyes shining with resistance no one could overcome.

1mp8bfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bookingcom/comments/1mp8bfh/thank_you_booking_support/,Thank you booking support!!!,"A while ago I posted how my wife and I stayed at the Pendry in Chicago (a very expensive Michelin key hotel, the fucking top of the building is literally made out of gold). Booking advertised it as having included breakfast, which it did not. Only a ""breakfast credit"" of $60 which was for the entire stay of 4 nights lmao. My wife and I spent that entire credit on the first breakfast by simply buying a sandwich, pancakes, and two coffees.

The Pendry support was fucking horrendous. Basically just ""Sorry man, hope next time will be better for you but you're out of luck"". It left such an awful taste in my mouth about that company that I will talk shit about Pendry for the rest of my life (mind you, we paid for one of their most expensive rooms too, so that's how they treat their customers).

But booking support came in clutch. They gave us a \~$400 credit (which is actually more than the cost of going from non-breakfast included room to breakfast included). So thank you to Booking support!

My only complaint is that it took literal weeks. Booking support is probably the slowest support I've ever had to work with, but at least we have a happy ending.",2,1755100615.0,Bookingcom,0,0.75,False

If you have friends who use Instagram, or you do yourself, then it's a good time to revisit your settings to make sure you're not sharing your location on Instagram. 

[Instagram's Friend Map](https://preview.redd.it/y6dmovki6tif1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=979b3087c65f33d7055913bf115704abc28e86b6)

The feature is clearly Meta‚Äôs answer to Snapchat‚Äôs ‚ÄúSnap Map,‚Äù which has existed since 2017. It is opt-in by default the first time you open it, but if you‚Äôve ever tagged your location in a Story, Post, or Reel, your device‚Äôs Location Services for Instagram may already be on. This means that a second visit to the map could turn it back on without you realizing.

**How it works:**

* Uses your device‚Äôs GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth to pinpoint your location.
* Displays your friends‚Äô locations on the Instagram map if they‚Äôve opted in.
* Shows location-tagged content (Reels, posts, Stories) for 24 hours.
* Works in the US for now, with a global rollout planned.

**How to disable Friend Map in Instagram:**

1. Open Messages.
2. Tap Map at the top of your inbox.
3. Tap Settings.
4. Select No one, then Done.

**How to disable Instagram‚Äôs location access entirely:**

* **iOS:** Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location Services ‚Üí Instagram ‚Üí set to ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù
* **Android:** Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí App permissions ‚Üí Instagram ‚Üí set to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt allow.‚Äù

Live location sharing normalizes unnecessary data collection. Big Tech wants more of your personal data, not less. The safest option is to keep location services off for social media entirely.

It wasn't so easy to meet her non-vacation since we are from the same city and the same home country. We just met yesterday. We first went for a coffee, afterwards for some cake and then the end set at a park and just talked to ate ice cream when I wanted to stand up and go she said let's stay a bit. I like the Conversation We're just having a normal time and she was even eating from my ice cream and we were sharing cigarettes.

After like 4 1/2 hours, she said she would take a taxi home and I said yes let's go since it was almost midnight midnight when we went to the taxi place they were just older guys which felt a little bit weird I asked her on our foreign language if she feels comfortable to help with one of them in the text alone and she said she's not sure so I hopped on the taxi with her and the guy was talking all the right loan how good I am looking and what a lucky girl she is when we went to her place. I hugged her said get home good And got back in the taxi to drive home to myself.
From there on, no communication and I woke up this morning with her unfollowing me everywhere.

I texted her that she could have gave me at least a text saying she doesn't want to meet anymore gave me one or two sentences before she just unfollowed me. No answer.

I'm really really disappointed because I thought we had a good day. I came and paid for everything acted like a gentleman and tried to be cool in the vibe with her especially since we talked for over a month and when you did this? 
It can't be the optics, since we were facetiming for weeks. And I really didn't try anything during the date.

My normal generic adderall (30mg IR from Teva) has been on back order for a while at my pharmacy (Walgreens, Wake county, NC) and my options were mallonckrodt (üëéüèº) or glenmark, which I‚Äôve never heard of. I decided to go with Glenmark, since we all know how horrible mallinckrodt is (personally, it gives me jitters, tension headaches, and no cognitive help). I tried to find some info about Glenmark before saying yes to it, and only came across a couple posts on here that made me think it might be okay, so I went with it. I thought I‚Äôd let y‚Äôall know what I think about it too, in case someone else is looking for info.

First of all, it‚Äôs the same color orange as teva, which was a nice surprise. I know color doesn‚Äôt actually mean anything, but there‚Äôs totally a placebo effect of color that makes me feel more confident in it. It also tastes similar to Teva. Not quite as sweet, but not bad or very chalky either. I only took it about two hours ago, but so far I‚Äôm feeling good. The potency feels right, and it feels less edgy than Teva. It also seemed to kick in more subtly and a little smoother than Teva. My heart rate feels up a bit, but it isn‚Äôt racing, and I also just drank some coffee, so that could be why. So far, it seems to be working really well for me, and I feel very balanced. I feel very clear headed and honestly my ability to focus seems more like it was when I took Vyvanse, but it doesn‚Äôt seem so Vyvanse-y (definitely more adderall-y) at the same time‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to explain that, but it‚Äôs a good thing‚Ä¶

At this point, it seems like it‚Äôs a good (maybe better?) alternative for me. I will update later and let y‚Äôall know if anything changes for better or worse for me!",1,1755100394.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Am in the process of diminishing my Lexapro dose,

Have been very upbeat and energetic, restless the last few days.

Feel kind of disconnected, tired, a bit out of it.

Drank a small amount of coffee twice today, first in the morning

second after becoming tired in the afternoon.

Feel kind of out of it.

Am not sure if I had some kind of visual hallucination?

I looked at somebody passing by me and saw them smiling with their teeth showing, upon further investigation,

they suddenly weren't smiling anymore.

I cannot tell if they truly were smiling or was it just my imagination.

Sometimes when I am with friends, I hear them say something, but afterwards realize they said another word that sounded somewhat

similar.

I shouldn't have any real hearing problems or eyesight problems.

I am also at the moment, diminishing the amount of time I spend on the internet, quitting Porn and video games, diminishing my

internet use.

I've read that internet addiction/ internet addiction withdrawal can lead to a psychotic break?

There was a period in my life where I thought someone else would take revenge on me for what I've done, at night I felt real fear

that something bad would happen.

Also today, I was very obsessive, felt negative emotions about something that seemed to be kind of minor.

Last few days I've done a bunch of productive things, but due to social anxiety, it's been stressful.

Oh, and one more thing. I remember when I was a kid, being scared when laying alone in the bed trying to sleep, my heart was pounding really hard, that sensation made me completely convinced that something was under the bed pressing up on my back, though the sensation was my heart beating really hard?

Other times is when I was a kid I was on the ferry with my family. I was really scared that the ferry would sink and couldn't sleep, all the noises I heard made me fearful that the ferry was sinking/would sink.

These examples seem like they are teetering on being psychosis, at the least delusions.

I also strongly believed in some scary stories on the internet about some planet is going to crash into the earth as a kid.

Also, there was a point in time where I was super obsessive about thinking that I have brain damage/ been damaged by radar on a ship I was working on, weird stuff. Since the radar was resetting my hand watch, I was scared that it had also damaged my brain/ eyes by electromagnetic heating.

Kind of out there stuff, but stuff that made me feel scared even if i technically knew it's unlikely? Still it elicited the fear response, as if it is true. A need to be certain about it?

I swear I only saw her as a friend at first. Like she just gets me, like a close friend or sister vibe? does that make sense?

Anyways. I don't know when, but now I kinda see her as more and I hate it. Because I haven't been in this situation since highschool. BUT at least with highschool it was always a friend in our group, so they were still in our friend group when I told them I liked them.

But in this case. Do I tell her? If she says no, does that ruin our friendship? She assumed I saw her as a friend, but now I like her, is that a kinda distrust? I'm so screwed

From my very first sip, I was hooked. I‚Äôve been a coffee drinker for nearly 30 years, but I haven‚Äôt had a single cup since. That first day, the euphoric feeling from my first two mates was incredible. While that initial rush has mellowed over the weeks, I still get a subtle lift without the jittery, anxious edge coffee gave me.

Mate also helped me almost completely cut out energy drinks, which I‚Äôd been consuming more and more of lately. Honestly, I was getting concerned about how much I craved them, knowing how unhealthy they are.

Now I‚Äôm diving deeper into the culture and looking forward to upgrading to more traditional, handmade gear. If you have recommendations, I‚Äôm all ears!

One of the coolest parts of drinking mate is how curious people are about it. Friends, family, and even strangers stop to ask what it is and how it‚Äôs prepared.

I have been struggling with caffeine dependence for years. I've tried to quit before but had no success. My fatigue was so severe that after sleeping 8-9 hours, I felt I had only slept 3 hours. By noon I was useless. Caffeine filled in the gaps for me to keep me going. 

Finally got treated for obstructive sleep apnea and have been using a CPAP. I do not crave caffeine like before. I actually feel energized in the morning. Now I may make a cup of coffee maybe every other day and may not even finish it. Before I was around 200-300mg a day, sometimes more.

I have a peculiar problem in my family where your ""izzat"" is connected with food. Whenever someone visits, my mom masi, mami etc make it their mission to feed them till they can't breathe. This is considered as showing respect to the guest. 

The same thing happens when we visit someone's house. Whole lot of sitting and eating.

I was fine with this when I was younger. I had a voracious appetite and never gained weight lol.

But now that I am 40 I have resorted to clean eating. Completely eliminated added sugar and processed, packaged, ready-to-eat food from my diet. Deep fried food has been reduced to once a month . Moreover, my body can't digest tea and coffee. Tea gives me acidity and coffee turns me into a night owl.

This is a big problem when I visit my relatives' place. I don't drink tea, coffee, soft drinks, don't eat pakoras, samosa, mithai, biscuits. I only ask for some fruit and lemon water. This makes them really anxious because I don't eat per their standards. lol.  

This spirals into long explanations, bargains, discussions, coersions, sometimes taunts. Mostly I give in and eat whatever they offer.

So, I hadn't met my cousin in a very long time because she lives quite far away. I figured the best thing would be for my daughter and me to go to her place to spend the weekend so we could catch up with all the relatives living in that area.

Her MIL (and all other relatvies) took it as a personal failing that I barely ate anything while there. They kept insisting they would order food from outside if I didn't like their cooking. 

Clean eating and portion control seem like alien concepts to punjabis.

Please give me some suggestions. I have a large extended family and love meeting them frquently. But I don't want to come across as snobbish or arrogant about food. I just want them to stop pestering me to eat every 5 minutes. lol.",4,1755099040.0,delhi,5,0.83,False

Low Complex (hrs), lo realism vs. Med-Hi Complex (hrs), hi realism?","Generally speaking, I feel there is a correlation between the complexity of a game and the realism of the game as well as the length of time it takes to play.

Given this, I am wondering what people preferences are?  Do you prefer low complexity games (such as Castle Itter, Field Commander: Alexander) that only take a few hours to play or do prefer the more complex, lengthy games such as ""Next War: Poland"" that takes a lot more time to learn but are more of a conflict simulation and generally superior in realism to the low complexity games?

For solitaire only games I generally am somewhat in between the two.  I usually have a game like ""Interceptor Ace"" on my morning table that I play while having coffee.   I also have a game like ""D-Day @ Tarawa"" or ""Enemy Action: Kharkov"" sitting on my gaming table that I play over the course of a week or two.

I don't know of any wargamers in my area and prefer tabletop games to vassal games..  For this reason I lean towards low complexity games like ""We are coming, Nineveh"" or ""WW2 Commander: Battle of the Bulge"" for two person games.  These are games I can explain to a new player in an hour or less and we can play the same day or over the weekend.  I've had a lot more success doing this than copying rules and having friends read on their own time.  When I have tried having other's read rules on their own we typically never start the game.",6,1755098892.0,hexandcounter,0,1.0,False

I started an internship recently and all my colleagues are older. And while there isnt much work so i expected to sit around on my phone  I‚Äôve noticed that all of them are super nice and quite chatty. Most of them are in their 40s, and during the day it is not unusual to joke around each other, they always made sure to present me and include me in the conversation. Some even started telling me about their lives. I know that some people find it annoying when others talk nonstop but for me it felt.. nice. Because i was at least seen, hearing interesting and less interesting stuff instead of just sitting around and existing like i do in school when my friends arent around. Even the 2 guys who are in their 30s are also talkative and fun to be around.

While at school, i feel like aside from my usual circle, most of the guy just dont want to talk or strike a conversation. And if i start talkinng or ask something many would just reply quickly and move on. I even have a funny anecdote of one guy who i noticed avoids me and looks away when i talk (?). I really am not a mean person, if anything i am more in a good, cheerful mood than a bad one whenever im around people and i know i do give of cutest vibe so i dont get it. It‚Äôs a shame because at some point i started questioning my sanity or if there is anything wrong in my attitude that pushes people away. But apparently there isnt because my coworkers like me just fine. In romantic talk it is also the same thing. Guys in their late 20s and 30s approach and talk more.  But like i said even in friendly casual chit chatting it‚Äôs the same. I dont know if those guys my age do not like me or if im doing something wrong around them that im not aware of. Even last time i was strugglinng with the coffee machine at work and a guy immediately came to help, funnily enough same thing happened in school cafeteria and some saw it but no one batted an eye. It‚Äôs really sad when you think about it.

So what is happening here? I dont want to be a pushover or annoying to guys who just dont want talk but is there anything i could do ? I feel like i need to socialise more with guys but i dont know how",0,1755098832.0,AskMenAdvice,37,0.31,False

We re always at about 60-70% compatability meaning things are good most times but thingz always happen that causes riffs, which makes it hard bc when they do,  i always wonder if moving forward might be a better answer rather than be content with 60-70%  happiness for rest of my life,  especially after being together 14 years. I'm not looking for fairy tale life but anyone that's been married knows how this can be difficult to manage.   Anyways.  ..

Last night my wife asked me ""when was the last time you thought I looked beautiful"". I sat in silence for a couple of seconds and I realize this is one of those questions that could blow up in your face if I answered wrong,  so i said "" i thought you looked really nice lastv week when you wore that new dress at the park""

Silence from her for about 10 seconds and she says "" so you don't think I've looked beautiful for over a week?"" So immediately I try and back pedal and say no,  you ALWAYS look beautiful but you in particular last week but damage was done.  She says I genuinely hurt her feelings and now I'm getting the silent treatment. 

This is the beginning of the coffee incident post where bc i didn't directly ask her if she wanted coffee, and just sent pics instead and didn't get her anything bc she never responded,  even though i can see she read abs saw my texts. I'm the a- hole. 

This also led into the other post regarding""why are you even here, meaning what do i contribute to the house and marriage"", bc in hey opinion she does everything.  

Is she being unreasonable,  was i just an a- hole for answering wrong? am i just in the dog house until she gets over it or until i make it up to her? What's the repair at this point?",2,1755098680.0,Marriage,8,1.0,False

I figured I‚Äôd make something ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to wake up, nothing crazy.  
  
But somehow‚Ä¶ the shot I pulled was better than anything I‚Äôve made all week on the big machine. More crema, sweeter, and just super well balanced.

Only thing I did differently was slow down a bit and really pay attention. 16g in, fine grind, even tamp. I think the grind was just right this time with a nice resistance but not choked up.

¬†

Stalking is nothing new to me. I must admit it's not my favourite pastime; that would be drawing, but I have to admit I have become very good at it.

¬†

Brad was easy to follow. Completely oblivious to his surroundings. A rookie mistake and one that he will have to be careful of if he is to stay in the game.

¬†

I wasn‚Äôt ever going to kill Brad; that wasn‚Äôt part of my plan, and if I did, there would never be a link to me, so it wouldn‚Äôt add to the mystery I was creating either.

¬†

After watching his fake sob and cry for a few minutes, falling to his knees and screaming in pretend anguish, Brad was escorted away by one of the few policemen at the scene. He took Brad to the back of the ambulance and had one of the paramedics put one of those shock tinfoil things over him. I moved around the park, not bothering to pretend to be doing something else. A crowd was there to try and grab a glimpse of the scene. There are too many people to watch, so acting how you always would is the best thing to do.

¬†

It was odd watching a killer from Affair as a killer myself. He pulled the foil blanket tighter around himself, looking to anyone else that he wanted to shut out the world, you know, a normal human response. Even from the distance I was, I could tell that that was a lie.

¬†

His head dipped and stayed stone still for a couple of minutes, bent over his headrest on his arms and knees pulled up; he was the shape you make when cannonballing into a swimming pool.

¬†

I knew what he was doing; he was remembering. Remembering what he had done to her. Judging by what I had heard, this wasn‚Äôt a crime of passion or anger; it was thought out and planned. He was remembering how it felt to take a life and to play with what you had taken. Both of us are sick fucks.

¬†

I had to speak to him. I had to tell him that he stole from me. He would understand; maybe not yet, but in time he would, I understand.

¬†

¬†

¬†

It‚Äôs hard to remember, considering the pain I am currently in, but I remember waiting for hours. Brad would move from ambulance to policemen to what I assumed was his family, each time crying. He was doing too much. Regardless of the murder he committed, Brad moved on along with most of the emergency services at the scene. The planned riot was about to begin, and being out when it started was not advised.

¬†

Eventually, after a conversation with a group of people that involved a lot of nodding, Brad made his way away from the crime and to his car. Not wanting to lose him, I ran back to my own car. Five tickets I wasn‚Äôt going to pay were left on my windscreen. I managed to drive around the block in time to spot Brad pull away and head west away from the starting point of the riots.

¬†

He drove for forty or so minutes. Bayram Crossing works much like New York, a grid system built for practicality. Left, right, left, left again ‚Äì it's boring; I hate it.

¬†

Brad pulled into an underground car park near the docks. There were plenty of apartment buildings around the area, of which I was sure one was his. I followed him down and watched him park up. He got out, with red eyes and face, either from crying or anger, a common feeling after killing a person, and headed towards a door that led to stairs.

¬†

I parked in front of a fire exit and got out. It smelt of cat piss and rat shit, and there was a constant dripping from somewhere. Before he made it to the door, I coughed. Still walking, Brad looked around and saw me. I coughed again, and again, and again. I fell to one knee and held my chest. I heard footsteps run over to me.

¬†

‚ÄúOh, bro, are you okay?‚Äù I looked at the shoes and saw it was Brad. I held my breath to make my face turn red and pointed towards my jacket pocket. He got the hint; thinking some kind of EpiPen was there, he reached down. At the correct moment I sprang up, catching his nose with my head. I heard a crunch and squeal as Brad fell backwards to the floor.

¬†

I straightened up, rubbing the sore spot on my head. Brad was wallowing as he held his face. The first real tears of the day mixed with the blood spilling on the floor. I stood over him. Despite his office look and muscles, he was nothing special; I had killed unremarkable people more special than him.

¬†

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you do it?‚Äù I asked, standing over him.

¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù He shouted back. I kicked him in the side, right in the kidney. The air left his body, and his crying abruptly stopped.

¬†

‚ÄúI asked, ‚ÄòWhy did you kill her?‚Äô‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you on about?‚Äù He said between gasps of air.

¬†

‚ÄúLaura. You killed her; I know you did. Why?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill my girlfriend.‚Äù He protested. I kicked him again.

¬†

‚ÄúYou did, Brad. You were last with her, so unless you left after I did and someone managed to get a couple of hours of night with her, then you killed her.‚Äù He looked up at me then. I could tell he was taking in my features. Average height, little stock but not fat, white, probably thought I was handsome ‚Äì who wouldn‚Äôt?

¬†

‚ÄúLeft after you?‚Äù He asked back. I knelt down, out of reach from a kick or punch.

¬†

‚ÄúYes. You see, I was planning to do what you did to her. I spent hours waiting and watching, and then I saw you go in after her.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo what? You‚Äôre some stalking killer, like Joe from You.‚Äù

¬†

That little fucker. I was interested when that show came out. A show about a serial killer that locks people in a glass box ‚Äì well, that‚Äôs how it was sold to me ‚Äì sounded fun. When I tell you I hated it with every part of my being. He‚Äôs dumb, so, so dumb. How does one fucker constantly fall in love and continue to say, ‚ÄòAh, yes, YOU are the one‚Äô? When I die, if anyone compares me to Joe Goldberg, I will make a deal with the devil to let me come back and stick a fork in their eyes.

¬†

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said, and then kicked him one more time for the comparison.

¬†

As he lay on the floor in pain, I headed to my car. I pulled out my gloves, hairnetand goggles. I bet you‚Äôre thinking that they are suspicious items to carry? They are; I‚Äôm a criminal. I put them on before walking over to where Brad lay on the floor. Oh, and I had a knife.

¬†

‚ÄúYou live in this building?‚Äù I asked. Brad nodded and got the hint. He got up and started to walk toward the door. I followed, making sure no one saw me or him.

¬†

Brad lives on the 3rd floor of a twenty-storey building. His flat was decorated with an ocean theme and smelt of seaweed and a slight whiff of sex. Clearly whenever Laura was round or he decided to polish his cucumber, he didn‚Äôt do a thorough job of cleaning. For some reason he had pictures of himself everywhere.

¬†

‚ÄúSit.‚Äù I demanded, and so he sat on his falling-apart sofa. I sat on the coffee table opposite, out of his reach. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked again.

¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill her.‚Äù He protested. His nose had swollen, and blood dripped on his rough carpet.

¬†

‚ÄúI know you did. Stop lying. I promise I won‚Äôt kill you if you tell me the truth.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSmart.‚Äù I leaned forward, knife pointing at his broken nose. ‚ÄúI have done this so many times.‚Äù My voice was thick and threatening without raising it. I have a good baritone that helps me appear menacing when needed. ‚ÄúI can tell when someone has taken a life. It‚Äôs like stages of grief, but with a lot more joy.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI promise I didn‚Äôt kill her, but I know who did.‚Äù That was interesting.

¬†

‚ÄúAnd who killed her, and if you are so upset, why haven‚Äôt you told the police?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause I can‚Äôt.‚Äù He said, his bottom lip quivering.

¬†

‚ÄúFor what reason?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause he can implicate me.‚Äù I was tired; I have no patience for people that dance around words. It‚Äôs annoying and reminds me too much of getting blue balled.

¬†

I stood and pressed the tip of my knife to his swollen nose. He winces in pain, and a small trail of blood runs from where the tip had just penetrated.

¬†

‚ÄúTell me plainly, or I will kill you. Please don‚Äôt make me; you‚Äôre not part of my mystery.‚Äù Tears welled up in his eyes again. It was a pleading cry this time.

¬†

‚ÄúPlease. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs here or not.‚Äù I pushed my arm forward to cover his mouth and dropped my voice to a whisper.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs here?‚Äù He just shook his head, not wanting to admit to anything.

¬†

I like to think of myself as a rational man. My actions are evil, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt rational, yet even the most level-headed man will do the irrational sometimes.

¬†

Looking back at it now, this was defiantly the moment where all my past sins caught up with me, like a karma blow to the head. You‚Äôll get that in a minute.

¬†

I took my hand off his mouth, allowing him to speak. My knife was pressed still to his swollen nose. I gave him the look that said, ‚ÄòGo on.‚Äô And he did, but in the way I had just told him not to.

¬†

‚ÄúHe will go mad without me. He‚Äôs here‚Ä¶‚Äù I push the knife into his face. Cartilage split, and my knife went into that hole where the nose is when you look at a skull. I don‚Äôt know the scientific name, and nor do I care. I withdrew the knife and swiped it across his neck, allowing him to choke on his own blood. He spluttered and wheezed and eventually died with the taste of copper pennies in his mouth.

¬†

He could have lived if he stopped fanny-arsing about. New English phrase for you Americans.

¬†

I stood staring at his body for a few minutes. He didn‚Äôt look peaceful. I had to leave.

¬†

I turned, and standing in front of me was Brad.

I could tell he was taking in my features. Average height, little stock but not fat, white, probably thought I was handsome ‚Äì who wouldn‚Äôt?

¬†

‚ÄúLeft after you?‚Äù He asked back. I knelt down, out of reach from a kick or punch.

¬†

‚ÄúYes. You see, I was planning to do what you did to her. I spent hours waiting and watching, and then I saw you go in after her.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo what? You‚Äôre some stalking killer, like Joe from You.‚Äù

¬†

That little fucker. I was interested when that show came out. A show about a serial killer that locks people in a glass box ‚Äì well, that‚Äôs how it was sold to me ‚Äì sounded fun. When I tell you I hated it with every part of my being. He‚Äôs dumb, so, so dumb. How does one fucker constantly fall in love and continue to say, ‚ÄòAh, yes, YOU are the one‚Äô? When I die, if anyone compares me to Joe Goldberg, I will make a deal with the devil to let me come back and stick a fork in their eyes.

¬†

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said, and then kicked him one more time for the comparison.

¬†

As he lay on the floor in pain, I headed to my car. I pulled out my gloves, hairnetand goggles. I bet you‚Äôre thinking that they are suspicious items to carry? They are; I‚Äôm a criminal. I put them on before walking over to where Brad lay on the floor. Oh, and I had a knife.

¬†

‚ÄúYou live in this building?‚Äù I asked. Brad nodded and got the hint. He got up and started to walk toward the door. I followed, making sure no one saw me or him.

¬†

Brad lives on the 3rd floor of a twenty-storey building. His flat was decorated with an ocean theme and smelt of seaweed and a slight whiff of sex. Clearly whenever Laura was round or he decided to polish his cucumber, he didn‚Äôt do a thorough job of cleaning. For some reason he had pictures of himself everywhere.

¬†

‚ÄúSit.‚Äù I demanded, and so he sat on his falling-apart sofa. I sat on the coffee table opposite, out of his reach. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked again.

¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill her.‚Äù He protested. His nose had swollen, and blood dripped on his rough carpet.

¬†

‚ÄúI know you did. Stop lying. I promise I won‚Äôt kill you if you tell me the truth.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSmart.‚Äù I leaned forward, knife pointing at his broken nose. ‚ÄúI have done this so many times.‚Äù My voice was thick and threatening without raising it. I have a good baritone that helps me appear menacing when needed. ‚ÄúI can tell when someone has taken a life. It‚Äôs like stages of grief, but with a lot more joy.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI promise I didn‚Äôt kill her, but I know who did.‚Äù That was interesting.

¬†

‚ÄúAnd who killed her, and if you are so upset, why haven‚Äôt you told the police?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause I can‚Äôt.‚Äù He said, his bottom lip quivering.

¬†

‚ÄúFor what reason?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause he can implicate me.‚Äù I was tired; I have no patience for people that dance around words. It‚Äôs annoying and reminds me too much of getting blue balled.

¬†

I stood and pressed the tip of my knife to his swollen nose. He winces in pain, and a small trail of blood runs from where the tip had just penetrated.

¬†

‚ÄúTell me plainly, or I will kill you. Please don‚Äôt make me; you‚Äôre not part of my mystery.‚Äù Tears welled up in his eyes again. It was a pleading cry this time.

¬†

‚ÄúPlease. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs here or not.‚Äù I pushed my arm forward to cover his mouth and dropped my voice to a whisper.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs here?‚Äù He just shook his head, not wanting to admit to anything.

¬†

I like to think of myself as a rational man. My actions are evil, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt rational, yet even the most level-headed man will do the irrational sometimes.

¬†

Looking back at it now, this was defiantly the moment where all my past sins caught up with me, like a karma blow to the head. You‚Äôll get that in a minute.

¬†

I took my hand off his mouth, allowing him to speak. My knife was pressed still to his swollen nose. I gave him the look that said, ‚ÄòGo on.‚Äô And he did, but in the way I had just told him not to.

¬†

‚ÄúHe will go mad without me. He‚Äôs here‚Ä¶‚Äù I push the knife into his face. Cartilage split, and my knife went into that hole where the nose is when you look at a skull. I don‚Äôt know the scientific name, and nor do I care. I withdrew the knife and swiped it across his neck, allowing him to choke on his own blood. He spluttered and wheezed and eventually died with the taste of copper pennies in his mouth.

¬†

He could have lived if he stopped fanny-arsing about. New English phrase for you Americans.

¬†

I stood staring at his body for a few minutes. He didn‚Äôt look peaceful. I had to leave.

¬†

I turned, and standing in front of me was Brad.

¬†

1mp7c6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mp7c6r/why_philips_aquaclean_filter_stands_out_review/,Why Philips AquaClean Filter Stands Out Review Improving Coffee Machines Effortlessly,"Testing out the Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/10 Philips AquaClean Original Calc and Water Filter feels like a subtle but definite upgrade to my everyday coffee routine. As an espresso enthusiast, the promise of reducing limescale and skipping descaling for up to 5,000 cups was too tempting to pass up. Over the past month of continuous use, I‚Äôve had plenty of opportunities to see how this water filter stacks up. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs both impressive and occasionally mildly frustrating.

**Ease of Installation**  
Setting up the filter was easier than I expected. The click-and-go system is truly a time saver. I popped it into my espresso machine without needing to decipher a long list of instructions, which immediately earned it some bonus points. It‚Äôs great for those who don‚Äôt want a tech headache just to enjoy better coffee. Between getting kids ready for school and early Zoom calls, simplicity is vital in my mornings.

[Grab Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/10 at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08g3l9ht2/)

**Water Purity and Coffee Flavor**  
There‚Äôs a noticeable difference in the coffee taste since using this filter. My espresso has become smoother without that faint aftertaste of hard water. The micro-porous filter seems to do its job well, naturally removing calcium through ion-exchange technology. The acidic bite I occasionally detected in my brews is essentially a thing of the past. My kids, while more focused on their hot chocolate than my espresso, even mentioned how my morning coffee smells better.  

**Maintenance and Longevity**  
The biggest selling point here is the lack of descaling for up to 5,000 cups. As much as I appreciate that, I did find myself questioning if it truly lasts up to the advertised limit. While I‚Äôm far from hitting 5,000 cups, the filter seems to hold up consistently, and my machine hasn‚Äôt developed limescale buildup yet. Cleaning and replacing it is straightforward, which is another bonus because no one wants a finicky product that takes more work than reward.

**Build Quality and Design**  
At 159 grams and compact dimensions (4‚ÄùD x 6‚ÄùW x 3‚ÄùH), the filter fits snugly without consuming excessive space. Its plastic build doesn‚Äôt scream luxury by any means, but it feels sturdy enough for what it‚Äôs meant to do. It‚Äôs designed specifically for Philips espresso machines, which means exclusivity in terms of compatibility‚Äîmore on that later.

**Energy Efficiency and Certification**  
This little guy holds up to its CE certification by promoting sustainable practices. Less descaling equals less water usage, and the longevity claim ensures we replace filters less often, cutting down on waste. I didn‚Äôt consciously buy this filter for environmental reasons, but it‚Äôs comforting to know it‚Äôs not a big ecological offender in the grand scheme of kitchen appliances.

**Highlights**  
- Noticeable improvement in coffee flavor due to purified water.  
- Extremely easy to install with the click-and-go system.  
- Prevents limescale formation, keeping the machine running longer.  
- Tight compatibility with Philips espresso machines ensures optimal results.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited compatibility; works only with specific Philips machines.  
- The plastic build feels slightly less premium considering the price.  
- While claimed longevity of 5,000 cups is impressive, it‚Äôs hard to verify without prolonged use.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this filter with other options in the market, I also tested filters like the Brita Intenza+ and Jura Claris. While both perform decently, they lack the exclusive integration this filter offers with Philips espresso machines. Brita, for instance, improves water quality but doesn‚Äôt target limescale as effectively as the AquaClean filter. Conversely, Jura Claris caters solely to Jura machines, demonstrating a similar reliance on exclusivity but at a somewhat higher price point. Where these competitors lag is in ease of use; AquaClean‚Äôs click-and-go system wins hands down in terms of convenience.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This filter isn‚Äôt exactly budget-friendly, but then again, quality often comes at a price. If you‚Äôre serious about maintaining a high-quality espresso machine and minimizing maintenance routines, this filter delivers solid value. Its seamless installation, reliable performance, and ability to enhance coffee taste make it worth considering. However, it might feel steep if you don‚Äôt own a compatible machine, as there aren‚Äôt alternatives in its price range that work as effectively for Philips systems.

1mp77uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mp77uo/what_makes_the_best_countertop_microwave/,What makes the best countertop microwave Farberware worth it?,"Microwaves are an essential part of my daily routine, and having tested many models over the years, I recently decided to try out the Farberware Countertop Microwave 700 Watts, 0.7 Cu. Ft. The brand has built a reputation for its accessibility, and this particular model seemed like a compact yet capable choice for smaller settings like apartments, dorm rooms, or even office break rooms. After using it extensively, I‚Äôve got quite a bit to share!

**Design and Build Quality**

This microwave scratches the itch for anyone looking for a compact cooking powerhouse. It measures just 12.99 x 17.3 x 10.14 inches and has a capacity of 0.7 cubic feet. To be honest, it‚Äôs perfect for my small kitchen countertop, leaving enough room for other appliances. Its stainless steel finish looks sleek and effortlessly matches modern kitchen aesthetics, though fingerprints do show more than I‚Äôd like. The easy-to-grip handle on the door is something I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd care about, but it‚Äôs so much better than those push-button mechanisms on many other models. Also, the child safety lock is a nice touch for those with little ones around, offering peace of mind.

**Performance and Features**

With its 700 watts of power, this little beast packs a punch for its size. I used it to heat everything from leftovers to pop popcorn, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. What stands out are the ten power levels that allow you to dial in the exact intensity you need. I tested its ability to defrost both by weight and time, and it handled frozen chicken and beef evenly without starting to cook the edges‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve had happen with less reliable microwaves. 

The six one-touch settings delivered on convenience too. When I pressed the popcorn button (a true test for any microwave, let‚Äôs be honest), it popped nearly all the kernels without burning a single one. The same reliability carried over to other presets like pizza and potatoes. Customizing and saving my favorite settings with the memory function turned out to be surprisingly handy‚ÄîI just set it once for reheating my coffee.

[Check Farberware Countertop Microwave price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b07vs476x8/)

**Ease of Use**

What I really appreciate is how intuitive this thing is. The clear LED display and large clock make it simple to keep track of cooking times. I‚Äôve used microwaves in the past where I had to second-guess whether the timer was counting down properly, so the simple functionality here is a breath of fresh air. Another big win is the interior lighting. For something so compact, Farberware didn‚Äôt skimp on this feature. I could easily monitor my food without opening the door‚Äîthat‚Äôs a nice little convenience I didn‚Äôt realize I missed until it was there.

**Good Points**

- Compact size, perfect for cramped spaces
- Ten power levels and multi-stage cooking options
- Six practical one-touch presets for popular food items
- Child safety lock for extra security
- LED display and easy-to-view timer

**Areas for Improvement**

- Fingerprints show prominently on the stainless steel exterior
- Slightly louder than I‚Äôd prefer
- Might feel underpowered for larger dishes due to its 700-watt limit

**Other Options**

When it comes to compact microwaves, there are definitely other products to consider. For instance, LG offers a small microwave with slightly higher wattage, and Panasonic has its inverter models that promise even cooking. However, both of these alternatives come with a heftier price tag and may lack the user-friendly presets Farberware includes. While the LG model boasts more power, it doesn‚Äôt fit as snugly on smaller counters. The Panasonic one excels in technology but can feel overly complicated for people just seeking quick functionality. Compared to these, the Farberware Countertop Microwave strikes a balance between performance and simplicity, particularly for anyone working with limited space or a tight budget.

**Value for Money**

In terms of how much bang you get for your buck, this microwave is in a sweet spot. While it may not rival expensive high-tech models in power or features, you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find something better in this price range for small spaces. It‚Äôs compact, efficient, and checks nearly every box for what you actually need day-to-day. Considering how affordable it is compared to competitive products and how well it handles the basics, it does feel like a solid investment for its defined niche.

I was sitting outside at a caf√© going through my phone while drinking my morning coffee. Apparently a bird decided to take a dump directly into my mug while I wasn't paying attention. I took like 3-4 good sips before I looked down and saw what was unmistakably bird poop floating in my coffee. I immediately spit out what was in my mouth and ran to the bathroom to rinse but I definitely swallowed some of this horrific mixture. Now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm about to get violently ill or if this is just one of those gross stories I'll tell people later. I know bird droppings can carry salmonella and other nasty stuff. But I also know people accidentally consume way worse things and survive.

Looking back at some earlier moments, I also feel like my coworkers don‚Äôt value me at all.

This is my first job ever. I started right after university, and while it‚Äôs only part-time, I needed to start somewhere. I‚Äôve been here for six months now. I consider myself a responsible person: I always try to get work done on time, and if there are any issues, I make sure to communicate with the right people.

I work 4 hours a day, 5 days a week, while my coworkers work full-time, 8 hours a day. We receive our tasks in Outlook and our boss usually assigns them, but we can pick ourselves. Lately, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm getting a much heavier workload than my coworkers. I can be buried in tasks while they leave their desks for two-hour coffee breaks.

Right now, I have 17 tasks on my plate. Most are nearly done, but some I haven‚Äôt even started. Meanwhile, my coworkers might have just 3‚Äì4 tasks at a time. We do the same type of work, so it‚Äôs not like their tasks take significantly longer. Yet most of the time, I‚Äôm still the one assigned the next task.

Today was a perfect example: I had 16 tasks already, and when a new one came in, I didn‚Äôt take it because I was overloaded. A little later, I saw it had been assigned to me anyway. That infuriated me so much I nearly broke down into tears.

I talked to my boss about this last week, but he told me it‚Äôs ‚Äúexpected‚Äù that I complete the same amount of work as my full-time coworkers ‚Äî even though I work 50% fewer hours and earn 50% less pay. That makes no sense.

To make things worse, my boss told me that my coworkers are ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù with me because I supposedly refuse certain tasks. That‚Äôs simply not true. I‚Äôve always completed every task assigned to me. People from other departments have never complained about me and are generally much kinder, but within my own department, the atmosphere doesn't feel as good as it used to.

Like a month ago, we were on home office and I had a lot of tasks, other coworker had 1. Like 6 tasks came and all got assigned to me. I made a worthless mistake in one of the tasks and the coworker that had 1 task got angry and told me that he is tired of me doing the bare minimum.

I still come across new types of tasks I‚Äôve never done before, and when I ask for guidance, I get passive-aggressive responses. But if I don‚Äôt ask and make a mistake, I‚Äôm still in the wrong. I feel like I can‚Äôt win.

Honestly, I feel like they‚Äôre using me because I‚Äôm young, new, and part-time. I‚Äôm not lazy, I was always able to do the work pretty fast (but not now, because I get assigned so much) ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt see why I should be doing so much more than everyone else for half the pay while others are just chilling.",1,1755098070.0,jobs,5,0.67,False

The double-sided measuring lines are practical for left-handed folks like me and those who appreciate clear readability at a glance. At 8.58 inches square and 10.28 inches tall, it‚Äôs compact enough for limited counter space. Despite being lightweight at 3.75 pounds, this sleek design doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. Bonus points for the docking base, which tucks the cord neatly away for a clutter-free countertop.

**Performance: Bringing Water to a Boil (and Tea to Life)**

This kettle is no run-of-the-mill appliance. The 1500-watt power is fast. I found myself timing how long it took to heat a full 1.7 liters of water‚Äîit‚Äôs quick. The six preset temperature controls are a godsend for tea enthusiasts. They ensure the water hits the perfect temperature, whether it‚Äôs green tea, coffee, or black tea you‚Äôre brewing. There‚Äôs also the handy ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù function that holds the temperature for 30 minutes. The stainless steel tea steeper adds another layer of versatility. You can brew tea directly in the kettle, which feels oddly satisfying and cuts down on extra dishes.

**Ease of Cleaning: A Mixed Bag**

As visually stunning as glass kettles are, they can be a nightmare to clean after weeks of use. The borosilicate glass is durable, but watermarks from hard water started appearing faster than I hoped. Hand washing is recommended, and while it‚Äôs straightforward, it‚Äôs not ideal if you‚Äôre used to tossing things into a dishwasher. The tea steeper does come with a small drip tray to avoid messes, which is a thoughtful addition, but the tray itself is another piece you need to clean.

**Control and Features: Dialing in the Details**

The functionality of the temperature presets deserves a highlight. Most kettles boil water and call it a day, but this one goes the extra mile. The six presets made experimenting with French-press coffee and delicate white teas surprisingly fun. Adjusting the tea timer in precise increments between zero to ten minutes was easy‚Äîalthough I wished there were clearer visuals on the process. Something as minor as better indicator light placement could have saved me some initial annoyance.

**Perks**

- Elegant and durable borosilicate glass construction
- Fast heating thanks to 1500-watt power  
- Six temperature presets that cater to tea and coffee lovers  
- A 30-minute keep-warm feature is perfect for multitaskers  
- Integrated tea steeper for brewing convenience  

**Shortcomings**

- Shows watermarks quickly unless cleaned regularly  
- Requires hand washing instead of being dishwasher safe  
- No visual feedback for temperature completion like a beep or chime  

**Alternative Offerings**

When comparing competitors, the Zwilling Enfinigy stands tall against options like the Fellow Stagg EKG and the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe. While Fellow‚Äôs minimalist design and precise coffee-brewing features attract specialty coffee enthusiasts, its limited capacity doesn‚Äôt hold up as well as the roomy 1.7-liter capability of this kettle. The Breville model, on the other hand, offers a similar temperature range and practicality, but I found it lacking in aesthetic appeal and the quiet functionality of the Zwilling. In terms of balancing sleek design, user-friendliness, and performance, this electric kettle edges out many rivals.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**

Price always plays a significant role in purchases, and this Zwilling kettle is no different. While it doesn‚Äôt land in the budget category, it does deliver premium features that justify its cost. Between the durable glass body, advanced settings, and overall functionality, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs worth the investment for tea snobs, coffee addicts, or anyone who appreciates well-designed kitchen appliances. However, if you‚Äôre just heating water to boil pasta, there are simpler options that might save you a buck or two.

## Key Features Analysis

The following are some of the key attributes of bulk slate coasters that determine if they are right for you.

**Material Quality and Thickness:**

The quality of the slate is paramount. Top-tier slate coasters are made from natural, dense slate, ensuring they are resistant to chipping, cracking, and staining. Thicker coasters (typically around 0.3-0.5 inches) offer better insulation and are less likely to break under pressure. The surface should be relatively smooth but retain the natural texture of the slate to provide a non-slip grip for glasses and mugs. Opt for coasters sourced from reputable quarries known for producing high-quality slate.

**Size and Shape:**

Standard slate coasters are typically square or round, with a diameter or side length of around 4 inches. This size is generally sufficient to accommodate moast standard cups, glasses, and mugs. Some manufacturers offer larger coasters for oversized glasses or pitchers.The shape is mostly a matter of personal preference, but square coasters tend to provide slightly more surface area than round ones. Consider the aesthetic of your existing decor when choosing the shape that best complements your style.

**Edge finish and Design:**

The edge finish of the coaster significantly impacts its overall appearance and durability. Some coasters feature raw, chiseled edges for a rustic, natural look, while others have smooth, refined edges. Raw edges can be prone to flaking if not properly sealed, so smooth edges are often preferred for easier cleaning and maintenance. Designs vary from plain slate to coasters with engraved patterns, monograms, or company logos.The design should be subtle enough not to detract from the beauty of the slate itself but add a touch of personalization or branding.

**backing Material and Grip:**

A crucial feature frequently enough overlooked is the backing material. Most high-quality slate coasters include a cork or felt backing to prevent scratching of furniture surfaces.the backing should be securely adhered to the slate to prevent it from peeling off over time. additionally, the backing material should provide a non-slip grip to keep the coasters from sliding around on smooth surfaces. Choose coasters with a durable and well-attached backing for maximum protection and stability.

**Sealing and Water Resistance:**

Slate is a porous material, so proper sealing is essential to prevent water absorption and staining. High-quality slate coasters are treated with a sealant that repels water and other liquids, making them easy to clean and maintain. The sealant should be food-safe and durable enough to withstand regular use and cleaning.Look for coasters that are explicitly labeled as water-resistant or waterproof.Regularly reapply sealant to extend the lifespan of your slate coasters and maintain their pristine appearance.

key features of top bulk slate coasters include:

* Durable natural slate
* Protective backing to prevent scratches
* Effective water-resistant sealing

4. **Review your wrong answers more than your right ones.** They‚Äôre your goldmine for learning.
5. **Don‚Äôt cram the night before.** Sleep helps you remember more than last-minute reading.

They started taking an SNRI around March and then went on Welbutrin at the end of june. With the Wellbutrin they are a completely different person. This morning they woke me up just to start a fight with me over a note I wrote them 3 weeks ago. I'm exhausted. I started documenting the changes in them around June 28th when I finally decided enough was enough. They have made jokes about crushing up their meds and putting it in coffee which after talking to the police about them physically blocking me in our apartment I found out from the officer this is a way people abuse Wellbutrin to get a stimulant like effect. 

I also have evidence that my meds have been tampered with and for a bit I had horrible brain fog and I just thought my meds weren't working. Now I believe my partner hasn't been taking their Cymbalta; and that they were dumping out my ADHD capsules and filling it with their meds. 

They literally don't remeber getting in my face and screaming at me that they thought I was manic. 

I already wrote their 2 PCPs about this, one of which they lied to me saying they were a psychiatrist when they weren't. They now have an acctual psychiatrist and have been lying to them about the extent of their manic episodes and made the dr think he's just depressed. 

This morning they woke me up to start a fight and asked me if I talked to my therpist calling me crazy and blaming my meds (which I have been stable on for years now). When I said my therapist was deeply concerned about my partner trying to harm me, due to these meds, they started fake crying and ran into the bedroom. 

I almost think I need to have them involuntary commited because I am just done with their BS. Their fanily called in a wellness check when they were threating suicide at Christmas  and I am afraid they're gonna start making those same threats again now.

I‚Äôve been living in Brussels since November, and bouldering has usually been my go-to way to meet people in a new city. Here, though, it hasn‚Äôt clicked the same way.

What‚Äôs been your experience? Any gyms or approaches that made it easier to connect?

First of all, it‚Äôs the same color orange as teva, which was a nice surprise.

So far, it seems to be working really well for me, and I feel very balanced.

One day, I got a call from a friend, Lana, who used to live on Oahu, but then moved to San Diego. She called me saying that she was now a traveling nurse and had to make a decision asap about whether to take a job on the Big Island or on the East Coast. She needed to make a decision within 30 minutes and it was for 3 months and wanted to know if she could stay with us and pay rent for that time. I asked my wife and she said, ""Fine, it will be good to see Lana again."" I called her back and said it would be fine for her to stay with us for that time. Then, she tells me, ""Oh, btw, my boyfriend will be coming with me too. And also, I'll need a car too bc I can't afford to rent a car bc I have a $500/mo car payment here in CA."" That was a bit of a shock given we had agreed to her staying with us alone, and now there would be two of them. She also asked if we drank coffee, and we did, so she told us she made a 12 cup pot everyday. She ended up going thru all our coffee in about a week after she arrived and Kona coffee was $18/lb.

So Lana and her bf arrived and he seemed nice and grateful. Then, a new wrinkle was that since she would be doing a 12 hr shift, so her bf would have to drive her to work and then get her afterwards, making 2 trips each day. I figured out that it was 60 mi one way from our home to the hospital she worked at which meant 120 mi RT and 240 mi each day with TWO trips down there. She'd be putting at least 960 mi/week on our car. Then, she added that her bf would go fishing during her shift and stay in town, but then also wanted to know where we could get some pot bc her bf liked to smoke pot while he went fishing. That was too much to ask, knowing that her bf would take our car, drive it around town and be stoned part of the time. We started arguing about it and after about a week, she found another place to rent, closer to work and I said that giving her a free car to drive around in was too much to ask. She finally agreed to rent her own car and went NC with us and we called her about when she would return our car. She also complained that the Honda Accord we loaned her did not have the AC working. Well, she eventually returned the car but never informed us when. Just a final text msg that, ""It's in your driveway."" Never paid us a penny for her first week stay in our home.

# Best Coffee Table Mirror 2025: Top picks & Reviews

The coffee table mirror, a seemingly simple piece of furniture, plays a pivotal role in enhancing a living space. It's more than just a reflective surface; it's a design element that can amplify light, create an illusion of space, and serve as a striking focal point.In 2025, with interior design trends leaning toward minimalism and maximizing natural light, the coffee table mirror is poised to become even more essential.Whether you're aiming for a modern, rustic, or eclectic aesthetic, the right coffee table mirror can dramatically transform your living room. This article will guide you through the top picks for 2025, providing in-depth reviews and considerations to help you find the perfect centerpiece for your home.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of a coffee table mirror are determined by several key features that elevate its overall appearance and practicality.

**Mirror Quality:** A high-grade mirror uses premium glass and exceptional manufacturing processes.

The mirror's reflective surface must be free of distortions, imperfections, and cloudiness to ensure a crystal-clear reflection. look for low-iron glass that provides exceptional clarity and color accuracy. Thicker glass tends to be more durable and less prone to warping or cracking. An anti-shatter film on the back of the mirror provides added safety in case of accidental breakage.

**frame Material & Construction:** The supporting frame determines the mirror's stability and style.

The frame can be crafted from various materials, including metal, wood, or synthetic composites. Metal frames offer sleek, modern lines and durability. Wooden frames exude warmth and can be customized with various finishes and details. Synthetic materials provide water resistance and affordability. Solid construction with reinforced joints and secure attachments ensures longevity and prevents wobbling.

**Size & Shape:** The dimensions and form of the mirror need to complement the surrounding furniture.

The ideal size of the coffee table mirror should be proportional to the coffee table and the room. A disproportionately small mirror may get lost, while an excessively large one can be overwhelming. Common shapes include rectangular, square, circular, and oval. Rectangular mirrors work well with elongated coffee tables,while circular mirrors soften the edges of angular rooms. Oval mirrors create a sense of elegance and sophistication.

**Edge Treatment & Details:** The finishing touches add to the mirror's aesthetic appeal and tactile feel.

The edges of the mirror can be beveled, polished, or left raw. Beveled edges create a subtle, elegant frame around the reflective surface. Polished edges provide a smooth, safe, and contemporary look. Decorative accents, such as inlays, carvings, or metallic accents, can further enhance the mirror's visual interest.

**Base & Support System:** The stability of the mirror comes from the support.

The base or support system should ensure the mirror remains stable and secure on the coffee table. Some mirrors have integrated bases, while others rely on the coffee table's surface for support. Rubber feet or non-slip pads can prevent scratches and slippage. The support system should be discreet and visually appealing, not detracting from the overall design.

**Weight Capacity:** The heavier the object, the sturdier the frame needs to be to support it.

even though the mirror is typically non-load bearing, it's essential that the frame be able to support it own weight so the mirror doesn't fall apart at the seams. This ties back to the frame material having a high tensile strength.

## Core Benefits

Utilizing a coffee table mirror brings many benefits to the space.

**Enhanced Lighting:** The mirror's ability to reflect light instantly brightens a room and reduces the need for artificial lighting, making the space feel more open and inviting.

The mirror acts as a reflector,bouncing natural light from windows and ambient light from fixtures,spreading it throughout the room. By strategically positioning the coffee table mirror near a window or light source, you can maximize the amount of light reflected, creating a brighter and more cheerful atmosphere. This can be particularly beneficial in smaller or darker rooms where natural light is limited.

**Visual Expansion:** Mirrors create an optical illusion of greater space, making a room appear larger and more spacious.

A well-placed coffee table mirror can make a compact living room feel significantly more expansive. The reflection creates depth and dimension, fooling the eye into perceiving a larger area. This is especially effective when the mirror reflects a visually appealing part of the room, such as a window with a view or a decorative wall. The mirrored surface tricks the brain into thinking there is more space beyond what is physically present.

**Aesthetic Enhancement:** Coffee table mirrors add a sense of style and sophistication to any living space.

With a wide range of designs, materials, and finishes available, you can find a coffee table mirror that complements your existing decor and adds a touch of personality to your living room. Whether you prefer a minimalist, modern look or a rustic, customary style, there is a mirror to match your taste. the mirror can serve as a focal point, drawing attention and adding visual interest to the room.its reflective surface adds a touch of glamour and elegance to the space.

**Versatile Functionality:** Beyond aesthetics, a coffee table mirror can serve practical purposes within a living room setup.

It provides a smooth, stable surface for placing drinks, snacks, or decorative items, and the reflective surface can subtly enhance their presentation. The mirror can also protect the coffee table's surface from scratches, stains, and heat damage. In addition, a large coffee table mirror can serve as a makeshift vanity for quick touch-ups or grooming.

**Reflecting Personality:** A coffee table mirror allows you to exhibit your style.

A unique mirror will reflect your personality in the living room. A clean, modern room can use a sleek black mirror to draw the eyes, while a colorful ecclectic room may benefit from a metallic trim or pattern to not subdue its personality.

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions when it comes to coffee table mirrors.

**Can the coffee table mirror be used on any type of coffee table?**
Typically, yes, but it depends on the coffee table's surface and stability. Ensure the surface is flat and stable enough to support the mirror. If the table has a textured surface, use non-slip pads or a protective layer to prevent scratching and slippage. Tables with delicate finishes may require extra caution to avoid damage.

**How do I clean and maintain a coffee table mirror?**
Clean the mirror regularly with a microfiber cloth and a glass cleaner. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals that can damage the reflective surface. For stubborn stains, use a mixture of warm water and mild dish soap. Protect the mirror from prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, which can cause discoloration or fading over time. Periodically inspect the frame and support system for any signs of damage or wear.

**What are the best lighting conditions for showcasing a coffee table mirror?**
Natural light is ideal for showcasing a coffee table mirror,as it provides a soft,even illumination that enhances the mirror's reflective properties. In the absence of natural light, use ambient lighting from lamps or overhead fixtures to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Angle the light sources to avoid harsh glare or reflections that can obscure the mirror's clarity.

**Are coffee table mirrors safe for homes with children or pets?**
when children or pets are present,safety is paramount.Look for coffee table mirrors with rounded edges and shatter-resistant glass to minimize the risk of injury in case of accidental breakage. Secure the mirror to the coffee table using adhesive pads or brackets to prevent tipping. Regularly inspect the mirror for any signs of damage or instability.

1mp6uci,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellsPalsy/comments/1mp6uci/diabetic_no_steroids_90_resolved_in_25_weeks/,"Diabetic. No steroids, 90% resolved in 2.5 weeks","Posting this because I wondered a lot when I first got BP. 

I am diabetic so steroids were not a great option for me and I was worried that would mean I would not recover but I have been recovering and am about 90% back to normal.

My recovery has not been  linear -- I got worse over 7 days with symptoms getting slightly better and slightly worse during the day and things did not really turn around until day 13 day. 

My biggest tool, even now as I am still trying to recover fully is finding pockets during the day to rest my face fully and deeply and keep both eyes closed. So as funny as it sounds I do my work outs with my eyes closed most of the time and I do 2 30 minute meditations most days where I would let my face muscles fullyyyyy relax. The days I did not do this I noticed a lot more discomfort and pain.

  
This video gave me some comfort: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxc7f18e5CM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxc7f18e5CM)

One thing he mentions is the first sign of recovery is more symmetry when your face is fully at rest and that was true for me -- the day I noticed my eyebrows almost even when my face was at rest without expression was the day things started to improve. 

I drank coffee during this time, and also got my latest covid vaccine with no regression.

1mp6tbx,https://youtube.com/watch?v=tcvBCmJYxLQ&si=T7j7hAPWRYYpgPGj,48 The Pomodoro Technique  Mastering Focus,"The Pomodoro Technique is a simple yet powerful time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into focused, timed intervals, traditionally 25 minutes of ""focus mode"" followed by 5 minutes of ""diffuse mode"" rest. Each 25-minute block is called a ""Pomodoro."" This technique is designed to combat distractions, enhance deep focus, reduce procrastination, and improve overall productivity and creativity by leveraging the brain's natural need for short recovery periods. Its effectiveness is supported by neuroscience and demonstrated through its adoption in diverse global contexts, including major technology companies and educational systems, and its alignment with ancient philosophical principles of focused effort and structured practice.

II. Core Principles and Mechanics

**A. What is the Pomodoro Technique?**

* **Definition:** A method to ""reclaim deep focus"" by ""breaking work into short, timed intervals.""
* **Interval Structure:** Traditionally, ""25 minutes of uninterrupted focus, followed by 5 minutes of rest‚Äîrepeated in cycles.""
* **Naming Convention:** Each 25-minute block is called a ""Pomodoro,"" named after the ""tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used in his university days.""

**B. How It Works: Focus & Diffuse Modes**

* **Focus Mode (25 minutes):** Characterized by ""complete immersion‚Äîno phones, no multitasking."" This is the period of intense concentration on a single task.
* **Diffuse Mode (5 minutes):** A period of ""relaxation‚Äîwalk, stretch, sip coffee, let your mind wander."" This allows the brain to process and consolidate information.
* **Neuroscientific Basis:** The alternation between these modes is ""backed by neuroscience‚Äîour brain consolidates learning better when we give it brief recovery periods.""
* **Combatting Procrastination:** A key benefit is that ""It fights procrastination by lowering the mental barrier to starting. 'It‚Äôs just 25 minutes' feels less overwhelming than 'I need to work all afternoon.'""

III. Global Adoption and Case Studies

The Pomodoro Technique's principles resonate across various cultures and industries, demonstrating its universal applicability.

* **Italy ‚Äì University Breakthrough:** Creator Francesco Cirillo, then a university student in Rome, ""found he could triple his productivity in a single day"" by using the technique.
* **Global Tech Integration:** ""Today, organizations like Google and Microsoft incorporate variations of Pomodoro for software teams.""
* **Japan ‚Äì Kaizen & Time Blocking:** The technique aligns with the Japanese philosophy of ""Kaizen‚Äîcontinuous small improvements."" Japanese companies utilize ""structured time-blocking to increase efficiency.""
* **USA ‚Äì Silicon Valley Focus Sprints:** Startups such as ""Asana and Trello encourage employees to use the Pomodoro Technique to break down big coding or design tasks into digestible sprints, reducing burnout and improving creativity.""
* **Finland ‚Äì Education System:** Finnish classrooms employ a ""45-min lesson + 15-min break cycles, a longer cousin of Pomodoro,"" which research shows ""improves comprehension and retention.""

IV. Cultural and Philosophical Alignments

The underlying principles of focused effort and structured rest within the Pomodoro Technique find parallels in ancient wisdom and practices.

* **Bhagavad Gita ‚Äì Nishkama Karma:** The technique mirrors Krishna's advice to Arjuna to ""focus fully on his duty without worrying about the entire battle‚Äôs outcome."" This translates to focusing ""on a small, present task (one Pomodoro) instead of the intimidating whole.""
* **Mahabharata ‚Äì Ekalavya‚Äôs Precision Practice:** Ekalavya's archery training, involving ""focused bursts, repeating skill cycles,"" exemplifies ""breaking mastery into intense, manageable intervals.""
* **Yoga & Pranayama:** Traditional yoga practices involve ""fixed time cycles of breath and posture‚Äîdiscipline in time and rhythm, just like the Pomodoro cycles, balancing effort (abhyasa) with rest (shavasana).""

V. Implementation Best Practices and Tools

**A. Key Tips for Implementation:**

1. **Prioritize:** ""Choose the hardest task first ‚Äì Beat procrastination.""
2. **Timer Selection:** ""Set a timer ‚Äì Physical timers often work better than phone apps (less temptation).""
3. **Tracking:** ""Log your Pomodoros ‚Äì Track what you achieve in each.""
4. **Longer Breaks:** ""After 4 Pomodoros ‚Äì Take a longer break (15‚Äì30 mins).""

**B. Supporting Tools:**

* **Flow App:** Minimalist focus timer.
* **Tomighty:** Simple desktop timer.
* **Be Focused (iOS):** Combines tasks and timers.
* **Engross App:** Android-based focus timer with analytics.

VI. Conclusion: The Psychology of Structured Focus

The Pomodoro Technique is more than just a time management tool; ""it‚Äôs about psychology."" It ""reframes work from a marathon into a series of short, winnable sprints."" By breaking down daunting tasks into manageable intervals, it empowers individuals to ""sharpen their focus before tackling the task."" In an era that often prioritizes constant busyness, ""the Pomodoro Technique quietly reminds us that structured focus beats endless grinding.""

VII. Proposed Visual Aid

An ""infographic for your training session"" titled ""Pomodoro Technique ‚Äì Global & Mythological Inspiration"" could be highly effective. This visual would ""combine the tomato timer origin, neuroscience diagram, and Arjuna‚Äôs battle preparation analogy,"" providing a quick and comprehensive overview for educators.

As California prosecutes a prison guard on nearly 100 charges, survivors behind bars say officer abuse is so widespread it feels inescapable: ‚ÄòAll I know is how to survive‚Äô

[*Sam Levin*](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-levin) *in Chino, California*

Sun 29 Oct 2023 07.00 EDT

Latasha Brown sat at a picnic table in the visiting area of the [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california) Institution for Women, just out of earshot of a guard standing watch. It was a hot morning in July and the 42-year-old spoke softly.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs liberty in deciding not to live in fear any more,‚Äù she said.

Brown was speaking out for the first time about the sexual abuse she has suffered at the hands of correctional officers over her 21 years in California prisons.

Once she started talking, she couldn‚Äôt stop: there was the officer who watched her shower, the official who demanded sexual favors in exchange for legal help, the officers who forced themselves on her and then gave her small ‚Äúgifts‚Äù. Brown says she has been sexually assaulted by at least five correctional officers during her time behind bars, and harassed by many more: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not only prisoners in here, we‚Äôre women, and we‚Äôre reminded of that through widespread male violence.‚Äù

In May, one of those guards, the former officer Gregory Rodriguez, was charged with nearly 100 counts of sexual violence. Authorities say Rodriguez is suspected of harassing, assaulting and raping at least 22 women in custody from 2014 to 2022, though court records and testimony from women and their lawyers suggest his abuse extends beyond the criminal allegations. Rodriguez has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

Five of the women who have come forward about Rodriguez say the abuse left them with lasting psychological distress that they‚Äôve struggled to overcome in prison. They describe a system in which a lack of access to basic amenities like adequate food and hygiene products and regular family communication make them vulnerable to abuse by guards who promise privileges or threaten further restrictions. Abuse is so widespread it can feel inescapable and ordinary, women said, noting that they face immense pressure to stay silent, living with the stress of potentially lengthened sentences or solitary confinement if staff retaliate.

**‚ÄòHe groomed me‚Äô**

¬†Brown has been incarcerated for more than two decades, sentenced to 37 years to life for a murder she committed at age 15. She says was sexually abused as a child and again in county jail before she was sent to California‚Äôs women‚Äôs prisons. Brown has spent time at both CIW, an hour east of Los Angeles, and the Central California Women‚Äôs Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla, where Rodriguez worked.

Standing at the vending machines in the CIW visitors‚Äô room, she selected a frozen pizza and a Starbucks coffee, luxuries she can‚Äôt get from the commissary: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just these little things that make you feel more human,‚Äù she said.

Predatory guards take advantage of the lack of supplies and conveniences, making women dependent on them for items they either need to survive or simply to feel normal, Brown said: ‚ÄúAs prisoners, our possessions are everything. What little we have is so important to us.‚Äù

Two officers who groped and assaulted her over the last decade would give her clothing to bribe her into silence, she continued, including bras and a bandana. One of the guards repeatedly fondled her at her prison job and then left her small presents in a trashcan not visible to cameras, she said. She remembers thinking of one of the guards as ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply ashamed of it, but I also knew there was no recourse for us.‚Äù

Valerie\*, an incarcerated woman in her 30s who says she was repeatedly abused by Rodriguez in 2014, said he at first presented himself as one of the kind officers. When she arrived at CCWF, she felt alone and was often by herself, she said.

‚ÄúWhen I think about how he groomed me, it wasn‚Äôt that he was forceful in the beginning. He was just a friendly face, always asking me how I was,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúWe appreciate the nice staff, because they‚Äôre the ones that treat us like humans. He positioned himself that way. I thought he cared ‚Ä¶ when really I was just being manipulated.‚Äù

Over time, Rodriguez started sexually assaulting her in unmonitored areas, she said, and pressured her to tell no one, warning that if anyone else knew, she‚Äôd face trouble. He suggested that would make it harder to get parole, she said: ‚Äú‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt want to be in that position because you want to go home.‚Äô‚Äù

She said she wanted the assaults to end, but was terrified of retaliation: ‚ÄúAt that time, I felt I was responsible for all of the abuse ‚Ä¶ I just felt trapped because I couldn‚Äôt talk to anybody.‚Äù

¬†**‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt defend ourselves‚Äô**

¬†The case against Rodriguez has sparked outrage in California, but data suggests the women‚Äôs experiences are incredibly common. The [last national survey](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri1112.pdf) of incarcerated people by the justice department, conducted in 2011 and 2012, counted roughly 47,000 people who had been sexually abused by staff in the previous 12 months, though the number is a significant undercount. The California department of corrections and rehabilitation (CDCR), which imprisons nearly 4,000 women, [logged](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/prea/wp-content/uploads/sites/186/2023/08/Annual-PREA-Report-Calender-Year-2022.pdf) more than 800 complaints of staff sexual abuse across the state last year.

‚ÄúThey say it‚Äôs one bad apple, but it‚Äôs not,‚Äù said Brown. ‚ÄúThe abuse of prisoners is widespread but has largely gone unacknowledged.‚Äù

Brown said she was working as an aide for women with disabilities last year and was bringing a woman in a wheelchair into a parole hearing room when Rodriguez opened the door and rubbed his body on hers as she passed through ‚Äì an assault he repeated on a second visit. She had not reported her previous assaults and didn‚Äôt want to disclose this one, either: ‚ÄúThere is shame and stigma attached to being not just a victim, but a snitch. So I‚Äôve learned how to fly under the radar and stay quiet. These people hold my life in their hands and I know the lengths they will go to cover up misconduct. I‚Äôve watched officers turn a blind eye to the conduct of their peers or facilitate attacks on other inmates. All I know is how to survive.‚Äù

When abuse did become known, the consequences for women often were severe. Both Brown and Valerie say they were placed in solitary after staff found out about Rodriguez‚Äôs assaults on them. CDCR says women who report abuse are placed in ‚Äúadministrative segregation‚Äù for their safety and when no other housing options are available.

Selina\*, who reported that Rodriguez sexually assaulted her and who has testified for the prosecution, said she lived with daily fear that more people would find out she was a whistleblower and that she would face retaliation or violence as a result; she does not talk to her prison counselor about what she‚Äôs been through. When any officer makes a snide remark at her or looks at her in a certain way, she panics, she said.

‚ÄúThe only thing they could really do to keep me safe is to get me out of here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt defend ourselves in here, because who is going to listen to us? We‚Äôre a number in here. We‚Äôre not treated like people. I just want to get home to my kids.‚Äù

**‚ÄòI internalized my anger‚Äô**

¬†The psychological toll of repeated sexual abuse in prison can be severe. Survivors of sexual assault described an intense struggle with shame, anxiety, fear, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress from living in an environment where abuse was normalized.

Compounding their challenges, many women who are incarcerated have already experienced trauma in their past. Studies in the US have [found](https://www.vera.org/newsroom/new-report-sheds-light-on-women-in-jail-the-fastest-growing-population-behind-bars) that 60% to 80% of incarcerated women experienced [sexual violence](https://vawnet.org/material/womens-experiences-abuse-risk-factor-incarceration-research-update) or domestic abuse before they were jailed, making them especially vulnerable to revictimization.

Several survivors described severe discomfort in confined spaces and feeling scared when anyone gets too physically close ‚Äì triggers that are impossible to escape in prison. Brown said she felt trapped in a state of ‚Äúpermanent alert‚Äù and ‚Äúperpetual uneasiness‚Äù; when anyone approaches her from behind, even a cellmate who is not threatening, it makes her body jump and her heart race. Recently a supervisor whispered something to her while trying to be quiet, and it caused her to panic.

Brown said that when she read old journal entries talking of the abuse, ‚ÄúI feel so sad for *her*. I minimize the abuse to distance myself.‚Äù

Rita\*, a 36-year-old woman who says Rodriguez assaulted her while she was incarcerated at CCWF, said that she had been sexually abused as a child and was so shaken and retraumatized by his attack that in the moment she almost physically fought back: ‚ÄúBut instead I just shut down, because that was my coping mechanism when it happened to me as a child. And I felt like I was a child again.‚Äù She was recently released and has struggled at her first job post-prison, where she has to work in close quarters with male employees.

Survivors have few or no outlets to process their trauma, said Amika Mota, executive director of Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition, a non-profit group that works with incarcerated survivors, including victims in the Rodriguez case. ‚ÄúSo many incarcerated people have never had access to any mental health support, so they hold so much within.‚Äù

Mota recently testified about her own experience of abuse inside California prisons and is part of a newly formed CDCR committee focused on preventing sexual violence. ‚ÄúThe narrative we are fed ‚Äì that if you speak up, you are no good, you are a ‚Äòsnitch‚Äô ‚Äì it becomes so internalized. Not speaking up becomes like a badge that we wear. The impact is that you begin to choke on your own voice when you start to use it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI really internalized that anger towards myself,‚Äù said Valerie. ‚ÄúI really did feel like I brought this on myself, and I tried to deny that it happened ‚Ä¶ I felt dirty and did not know how to get rid of that filth.‚Äù She eventually became an educator, teaching her peers about sexual assault policies, which she said helped her speak out and learn to set boundaries.

**‚ÄòI will not bow down‚Äô**

¬†CDCR declined multiple interview requests over several weeks. A spokesperson, Terri Hardy, said in an email that the department ‚Äúinvestigates all allegations of sexual abuse, staff sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment pursuant to its zero-tolerance policy and as mandated by the federal [Prison Rape Elimination Act](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/prea/)‚Äù. The policy ‚Äúalso provides guidelines for the prevention, detection, response, investigation, and tracking of allegations against incarcerated people‚Äù, she said.

Rodriguez‚Äôs arrest, Hardy added, followed CDCR‚Äôs internal investigation and referral to prosecutors: ‚ÄúThe department resolutely condemns any staff member ‚Äì especially a peace officer who is entrusted to enforce the law ‚Äì who violates their oath and shatters the trust of the public.‚Äù

Brown, one of the first to speak publicly about Rodriguez, said she knew there were risks in coming forward, but that it was empowering to no longer stay quiet: ‚ÄúI am guilty of the worst of human behavior. But just because I‚Äôm in prison does not mean my body and my labor are interchangeable properties.‚Äù She also agreed to testify before a recent hearing of lawmakers and CDCR leaders. Although officials declined to allow her to speak live, an advocate read her remarks, in which she recounted the moment she learned of Rodriguez‚Äôs arrest.

‚ÄúI did not celebrate because sure, when we experience harm, we want some accountability. Some justice, even,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHowever, I don‚Äôt think his punishment should be the final resolution because it‚Äôs an amplified response to just one person‚Äôs abuse, not a response to the systemic abuse. And until our lives matter, I will not bow down.‚Äù

My goal was to hit a utility road for the local power company and climb to a mountain pass for an easy out and back.

Left home at 2:45am. When I got there, the moon was almost full still and the mountains were all lit up. I left my headlamp in the car and started right at 3:59am. The climb was steep so I started with run-walks all the way to the pass. Luckily, I was above the clouds and got to see a bunch of meteors shooting overhead on the way up.

Got to the pass 50 minutes later. The pass was oriented NE so I got to see a few more meteors shooting overhead. Turned around and cruised back down to my car. Made it by 5:30am.

Off to work now (thank God for coffee).

Let‚Äôs just say‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve got the lifespan of a TikTok.

But the one thing you still control? **Your copy.**  
That‚Äôs the difference between a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù campaign and one that prints money.

Here‚Äôs my **2026-tested, 10-point ad copy checklist** you can steal before your next launch.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open With a ‚ÄòStop-Scrolling‚Äô Hook

* Your first line decides whether they read or swipe past.
* Go bold: ask a surprising question, call out an unpopular truth, or throw in a stat they can‚Äôt ignore.
* *Example:* ‚Äú97% of Shopify store owners are making this ONE checkout mistake‚Ä¶‚Äù

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Talk to Your People, Not Everyone

* The more specific you get, the more people feel ‚ÄúWow, this is for me.‚Äù
* Use audience cues: ‚ÄúShopify store owners,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew agency founders,‚Äù ‚ÄúBusy parents.‚Äù
* Even your visuals should scream who this ad is for.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hit Them Where It Hurts (Gently)

* Every winning ad starts with a pain point they *already feel*.
* Borrow language from reviews, Reddit threads, or DMs ‚Äî your copy should sound like they wrote it.
* Example: Instead of ‚ÄúStruggling with Facebook ads?‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúSick of paying Zuckerberg $500 a week for zero sales?‚Äù

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sell the Transformation, Not the Tool

* Features explain, benefits sell.
* Instead of ‚ÄúAI-powered CRM,‚Äù say ‚ÄúClose 3x more deals without touching a spreadsheet.‚Äù
* People care about where you‚Äôre taking them, not the vehicle.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Sound Like a Human, Not a Billboard

* Write like you‚Äôd talk to a friend over coffee ‚Äî no ‚Äúcorporate voice.‚Äù
* Use contractions, short sentences, and even a bit of humor when it fits.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Tell a Snack-Sized Story

* Humans remember stories, not specs.
* Micro-story format: Problem ‚Üí Twist ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Payoff.
* Example: ‚ÄúWe were ready to shut down our Shopify store‚Ä¶ then a 10-minute checkout tweak added $15K in sales.‚Äù

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Make the CTA a No-Brainer

* ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù is fine. ‚ÄúGet your free 7-day Shopify audit‚Äù is better.
* Your CTA should tell them **exactly** what happens next and why they should care.

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ Front-Load the Good Stuff

* If your first 2 lines don‚Äôt make them curious, they‚Äôll never click ‚ÄúSee More.‚Äù
* Put your best hook, stat, or offer right up top ‚Äî save fluff for your diary, not your ad.

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ Match the Offer to Their Mood

* Cold traffic = curiosity & value (guides, checklists, tools).
* Warm traffic = low-friction offers (free trials, discounts, demos).
* Hot traffic = urgency (limited spots, expiring offers).

# üîü Don‚Äôt Get Slapped by Facebook

* Watch your wording ‚Äî no personal attributes (‚ÄúAre you broke?‚Äù) and no unrealistic claims (‚ÄúLose 10 lbs in 7 days‚Äù).
* Use compliant language: ‚ÄúMany people struggle with‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre struggling with‚Ä¶‚Äù
* Nothing kills momentum like a disapproved ad.

**üöÄ Bonus Tip:**  
Launch **3‚Äì4 variations** with tiny changes to the hook and CTA ‚Äî Facebook‚Äôs AI will do the heavy lifting to find the winner.

**üí≠ Final Word:**  
The creative is now the targeting.  
Nail the hook, speak their language, and make the next step effortless ‚Äî and you‚Äôll win in 2026, algorithm changes or not.",1,1755096690.0,MARKETINbuzz,0,1.0,False

I cannot tell if they truly were smiling or was it just my imagination.

Other times is when I was a kid I was on the ferry with my family. I was really scared that the ferry would sink and couldn't sleep, all the noises I heard made me fearful that the ferry was sinking/would sink.

These examples seem like they are teetering on being psychosis, at the least delusions.

I also strongly believed in some scary stories on the internet about some planet is going to crash into the earth as a kid.

Also, there was a point in time where I was super obsessive about thinking that I have brain damage/ been damaged by radar on a ship I was working on, weird stuff. Since the radar was resetting my hand watch, I was scared that it had also damaged my brain/ eyes by electromagnetic heating.

# Best 16 oz Water Bottle 2025: Top Brands Reviewed!

The 16 oz water bottle has become an essential item for health-conscious individuals and those seeking to reduce their environmental impact. Its compact size makes it ideal for on-the-go hydration, fitting easily into bags, backpacks, and even cup holders. This size is particularly popular for childrenS lunchboxes, gym workouts, and short trips when a larger bottle isn't necessary. This review dives deep into the top 16 oz water bottles available in 2025, examining their features, benefits, and how they stack up against the competition. We aim to provide you with comprehensive data to make the most informed purchase decision, ensuring you stay hydrated in style and with confidence.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal 16 oz water bottle combines durability, functionality, and design to provide a superior hydration experience. Key factors to consider include material construction, insulation technology, leak-proof capabilities, and ease of cleaning.

**Material Construction**

The material of a water bottle significantly impacts its durability, taste neutrality, and overall safety. Stainless steel, particularly food-grade 18/8 stainless steel, is a popular choice due to its resistance to rust, corrosion, and leaching of chemicals. Tritan plastic is another common option; it's BPA-free and offers excellent clarity and impact resistance. Glass bottles provide pristine taste but require careful handling due to their fragility. Some bottles also incorporate silicone sleeves or components for added grip and protection.

**Insulation Technology**

For those who prefer their drinks cold or hot for extended periods, insulation is crucial. Double-walled, vacuum-insulated stainless steel bottles are highly effective at maintaining temperature. This technology creates a thermal barrier that minimizes heat transfer, keeping beverages cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours, depending on the bottle's design and ambient conditions. Some bottles incorporate additional copper lining within the insulation for enhanced thermal performance.

**Leak-Proof Design**

A leak-proof design is essential to prevent spills and messes, especially when carrying the bottle in a bag or backpack. Look for bottles with secure lids featuring silicone gaskets or O-rings that create a watertight seal. Some bottles use innovative locking mechanisms or flip-top designs that further minimize the risk of leaks. The quality of the lid and its components contributes significantly to the overall dependability of the bottle.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Maintaining hygiene is paramount when it comes to water bottles. Wide-mouth openings facilitate easy cleaning with a bottle brush, and dishwasher-safe components simplify the process further. Bottles with minimal parts and smooth internal surfaces are less likely to harbor bacteria or residue. Stainless steel and glass are generally easier to clean than plastic,which can sometimes retain odors or stains.

Key features of the best 16 oz water bottles include:

 Durable construction
 Effective insulation
 Secure, leak-proof lids
 simplified cleaning processes

**Are all 16 oz water bottles dishwasher safe?**

Not all 16 oz water bottles are dishwasher safe. while some bottles, particularly those made of stainless steel or Tritan plastic, can be safely washed in the dishwasher, others may require hand washing.

1mp6kbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mp6kbh/discover_if_the_cuisinart_ss12_coffee_maker_is/,Discover if the Cuisinart SS-12 Coffee Maker is Worth It Review,"Testing coffee makers can be a daily adventure, especially for someone like me who thrives on caffeine. The **Cuisinart SS-12 Coffee Center Brew Basics** is an appliance that tries to fit into both worlds seamlessly. It promises dual functionalities ‚Äì a full-sized coffee maker capable of brewing 12 cups and a single-serve side for quick coffee fixes. Over the last couple of weeks, I've tested this machine in almost every scenario, from groggy early mornings to more experimental coffee sessions.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stands out with this coffee maker is its sleek black and silver finish, which blends easily into most modern kitchens. The 10.3‚ÄùD x 9.75‚ÄùW x 14.5‚ÄùH dimensions make it compact enough to fit under standard cabinets but still large enough to accommodate a 12-cup glass carafe. The black plastic exterior paired with the glass carafe looks polished but doesn‚Äôt feel overly premium ‚Äì more functional than fancy. However, at around 9.5 pounds, the weight gives it a sturdy presence on the counter. Everything feels well-constructed but not over-engineered.  

**Dual Brewing Options**  
This dual brewing setup is what I've enjoyed most. The single-serve side is compatible with any single-cup pod (including Keurig‚Äôs K-cup), making it ideal for groggy mornings when all you want is a quick cup without fumbling with filters and grounds. The 12-cup carafe on the other side, on the other hand, saved the day during weekend brunches when guests were over. Both sides have dedicated water reservoirs ‚Äì 64 oz for the carafe and 40 oz for the single-serve. Charcoal water filters are included for both, which I found to be a neat touch for enhancing flavor.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Versatile brewing options for individuals or groups.  
- Programmable settings for effortless scheduling.  
- Brew Pause feature lets you grab a cup mid-brew.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
After multiple uses, the Cuisinart SS-12 produces consistently good coffee. The drip side delivers rich and aromatic coffee. I noticed that grind size and coffee amount do play a significant role in the end result ‚Äì if it‚Äôs too coarse or insufficient, the coffee can feel underwhelming. For single-serve brews, the three brewing sizes (8 oz, 10 oz, 12 oz) are convenient. The temperature was just right across all my tests (whether pods or ground coffee), and the coffee never felt lukewarm. The adjustable ‚ÄúKeep Warm‚Äù timer for up to 4 hours is perfect for lazy mornings where a second cup is inevitable.  

**Ease of Use and Programmability**  
Navigating through the LCD control panel is simple. The 24-hour programmable feature came in handy throughout the week. I set up my coffee to brew at 6 AM, and it worked flawlessly each day. The ‚ÄúAdd Water‚Äù alert on the display is a lifesaver ‚Äì no more burnt smells from accidental dry runs. Switching between single serve and the carafe system is intuitive, with everything labeled and logically placed. Cleaning, however, could be better. The drip tray on the single-serve side tends to pool water, requiring regular drying.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The drip tray on the single-serve side can get messy.  
- Plastic build feels functional but lacks a high-end touch.  
- Requires careful calibration of ground coffee for the best drip brew results.  

**Product Rivals**  
Coffee enthusiasts will naturally compare this model with alternatives like the Keurig K-Duo Plus or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Both competitors also offer dual functionalities. The Keurig wins slightly in single-serve brewing convenience, as their machines are slightly faster. However, the Cuisinart scores points for its programmability and better carafe brewing. While Hamilton Beach wins on affordability, it doesn‚Äôt match the versatility or built-in water filtration features of the Cuisinart SS-12. Certain aspects of ease of maintenance lean toward Keurig, making it a strong contender.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering its price point, which balances innovative features and a well-rounded brewing experience, the Cuisinart SS-12 feels justified in its category. It isn‚Äôt the cheapest coffee maker on the market, but the amount of thought put into its practical design and everyday usability makes it worth considering. If you‚Äôre someone who toggles between individual coffee moments and entertaining multiple guests, this machine is one of the better options available. For its feature set, I‚Äôd call it a solid investment in convenience and coffee satisfaction.

1mp6j3p,https://i.redd.it/09duw1a2vsif1.jpeg,$20k in a week with digital products on threads (here‚Äôs how),"How I made $20k from threads (passively)

Breaking this down because I‚Äôm tired of people saying threads is bad and the traffic is weak.

I started from 0 followers 
no previous knowledge on threads algo and NO help.

Here‚Äôs how I did it - 

First step is monetisation. 

I needed to advertise something that 
- Isn‚Äôt a product 
- has a larger audience 

So I landed on a cpa offer where I get paid per action (survey,download etc)

Next I needed to pick a niche. I was stuck between 

- clothing 
- Coffee 

I decided to go for coffee and chose a Starbucks gift card cpa offer. 

This way I could target 3 main geos 
- Canada US UK 

Next was content 

I used my previous experience on TikTok and IG and used a ai tool to transform those into threads

(Keep in mind I would have just ripped other peoples threads but I was too early)

But before I could post my offer threads I wanted to warm my account up

Warming up-

The easiest way to do this is scroll your homepage and find a trend 

At this time there was a trend going around 

‚ÄúCan you edit this person out of the picture they(add a good interesting reason) and added a pic from Pinterest )

Woke up to 1m views after 7 hrs

This went viral because of the engagement aspect.

800+ comments of people believing it.

Now while the hype was on I decided to make my second post.

I did the ex employee angle that I took from TikTok if you don‚Äôt know what it is here‚Äôs a quick short breakdown 
 Ex - employee 
- pose as a employee of the brand your offer is based around 
- Claim you got fired or left for a interesting reason (make people feel bad for you)
- Claim your gonna expose them in the other slides(people love tea and life hacks) 
- Add 2-3 simple facts and then add your offer as a ‚Äúfact‚Äù

Now I already had Starbucks employee and work images so I made my post 

1- Hook a img of a Starbucks employee 

Caption - I just got fired from Starbucks after being 5 minutes late because I was dropping my baby off to daycare

So now I‚Äôm exposing them ( a thread) üßµ 

Then continued with the facts 

3 straight posts hit over 2m views 

then my account got banned (rip)

So I made one more accounts but this time I was more careful 

- I hid comments about my offer being ‚Äúsketch)
-  I had 2 more accounts that I commented vouches for my offer being

Ended with 13m views on the week/month and $20k in revenue

You might be wondering how this is ‚Äúpassive‚Äù I was getting 100k views a day without posting on my previous posts. Just needed to schedule one a day without posting a little change in post

Each step I take echoes into the void, then dies. No return sound. No comfort in knowing the space around me. Only the abyss ahead. The air is brisk, and unnaturally cold‚Äîthe kind that doesn't just touch your skin, but seeps into your ribs, wrapping around your heart like a tightening fist.

I move forward. One step. Another. My boots scrape against cracked concrete. My breath comes slow, shallow, trying to make no sound. Without realizing it, I start counting.

One. Two. Three.

By twenty, I see it.

The thing that Luke was hunting.¬†*""If I am not back in an hour, don't follow. Just run, understood?""*¬†That was five hours ago, and if it's here and he is not... No. He is stronger than that. He's a soldier, and my best friend, my anchor. The man who pulled me from the twisted metal of that bus, whose hands never shook when the sky rained fire. He's the one who taught me how to tell if water was safe by smell alone, how to sleep with one ear open, and how to shoot without closing my eyes. He never asked for thanks. Never once made me feel like a burden. When the dark pressed in, Luke made me believe we could still push it back.

My heart races at the thought of him alone and hurt, or maybe worse. I will save him. I¬†*have*¬†to save him.

It stands ahead‚Äîa walking ruin of what used to be a man. Decayed flesh clings to its bones like wet paper. It sways in a slow rhythm, like a song only it can hear. Its head hangs forward, oblivious to me. My flashlight bathes it in harsh light. Blood stains spread across its torn shirt from battles untold, the tatters of its jeans hanging loose around skeletal legs.

Before the world rotted, he could have been anyone‚Äîa neighbor, a father, a man with morning coffee and a half-read newspaper. But now he's reduced to nothing but hunger.

I search the shadows for any sign of Luke, but there's only emptiness. My fingers tighten around the rifle. Luke always told me hesitation killed faster than any monster. I steady my breath, lining up the shot‚Äî

Something shifts behind me.

Not a sound I hear, but one I feel‚Äîa tremor through the floor. A subtle quiver in my bones.

The smell hits first: wet, rancid meat, sharp copper, and a sweetness like fruit rotting in the sun. Then comes the breath‚Äîhot, damp, and heavy on the back of my neck.

I turn, almost falling in my panic.

The Beast's chest is the first thing I see. Broad. Wrong. Its skin is a deep purple where rot hasn't yet claimed it. Where its jaw should be, there's only a torn cavity, strands of muscle twitching faintly. Above, two empty sockets lock on me. I feel its stare like ice water poured into my veins.

It moves first.

Its arm whips out‚Äîthe impact shatters my ribs before I even realize it's swinging. I barely have time to brace before I'm airborne, slamming into the wall behind me. Pain flares hot and bright. My M4 clatters as it flies from my grasp, metal ringing against stone before settling just out of reach.

It steps over the weapon in its hunt for the next meal. Each meaty footfall sends a shiver through the ground, as if the earth itself fears it. My hope fractures with every step.

But Luke... Luke's the reason I'm still breathing. He's patched me up after fights that should have ended me. Pulled me away when I wanted to stay and die.

I will¬†**NOT**¬†let him die here.

I tear my knife from its sheath. The sound of metal on leather cuts through the silence. I swing with everything I have. The blade bites deep into the side of its skull. A crunch runs up my arm as it lodges in bone.

It doesn't stop moving.

No flinch. No stagger. Just the slow, steady turn of its head toward me.

The next blow comes fast‚Äîits left hand swings wide. I duck, only for its right to slam into my head. My skull rattles like loose bolts in a jar. The wall behind me crumbles under the force. I drop to the floor.

I taste blood.

The world tilts. My arms refuse to lift me. My legs feel foreign, disconnected.

I can't move.

It looms over me, shadow swallowing what little light is left. Slowly, it raises one arm for the finishing strike

Is this how it ends? Alone?

**BANG!**

The gunshot tears through the moment, swallowing every other sound. My ears ring as a bullet rips through the side of the creature's head, ricocheting off my knife's blade still in the monster‚Äôs skull. The thing folds inward and collapses beside me.

A tall figure steps out of the dark‚Äîbroad shoulders, blond hair damp with sweat, blue eyes catching the weak light.

It‚Äôs him. Luke.

My breath catches.

He holds out a hand. I reach for it, but my knees give out. Luke grabs my arm before I fall, hauling me upright.

""You okay?"" His voice is steady, but his eyes scan me for damage.

""I've been better,"" I gasp out with a shaky laugh.

""Let's get you back."" His voice is as strong and comforting as ever.

""Thank‚Äî"" I start, but everything changes in an instant. A small canister, no bigger than a bottle, flies into the room. Luke's eyes widen in recognition his hand flies to shield my own but just a bit too slow.

The ringing in my ears swells to a deafening roar. Hands‚Äîsomeone's hands‚Äîgrab me, pulling me down. The last of my strength slips away, draining like water through cracked stone.

From light to darkness.

And then, nothing.

CHP.2

Consciousness returns like surfacing from deep, black water.

The first thing that hits me is the smell‚Äîsharp disinfectant trying to drown something rotten underneath. Chemicals burn my nostrils, but beneath it lurks the sweet-sick stench of decay. My stomach lurches before I'm even fully awake.

Cold metal presses against my spine. Every muscle in my body feels like it's been wrung out and left to dry. When I try to move, leather bites into my wrists. My ankles too. The straps are old but strong, worn smooth by how many others who've lain here before me?

The room swims into focus through the haze of whatever they pumped into me. Dim fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting everything in sickly yellow. Concrete walls. No windows. A single door with a small glass panel, dark on the other side.

My jacket hangs on a chair across the room like a taunt‚Äîclose enough to see, far enough to hurt. Someone cut my shirt away. Crude black stitches march along my left side, the skin around them angry and swollen. When I turn my head, bandages pull tight against my skull, and the world tilts sideways.

Voices drift through the door. Low. Clinical.

""What's the situation with the first subject, Jen?"" The man's voice carries the kind of authority that's used to being obeyed.

""Extensive trauma. Multiple fractures, severe blood loss."" The woman‚ÄîJen‚Äîspeaks like she's discussing livestock. ""He's stabilized, but barely responsive. Not viable for the program.""

Luke. They're talking about him like he's already dead.

My chest constricts. The leather straps suddenly feel tighter, cutting off circulation. I want to scream his name, to demand they tell me where he is, but something keeps me silent. He taught me that‚Äîsometimes staying quiet keeps you alive longer.

""And the other?""

""Concussion, lacerations, but stable. Young. Strong. They'll do well in Phase One.""

Phase One. The words settle in my stomach like swallowed glass.

I've heard whispers about places like this. Research facilities that popped up after the world ended, run by people who decided the collapse was an opportunity rather than a tragedy. Luke called them vultures‚Äîpicking over the bones of civilization for anything useful.

The door swings open with a soft hiss.

A short man in a pristine white coat steps in, wire-rimmed glasses catching the harsh light. He moves with the careful precision of someone who's never had to fight for his next meal, never slept with one ear open. His hands are soft, unmarked by the violence that's shaped the rest of us.

""Good morning, Alex."" His smile is practiced, empty. ""I hope you're feeling better.""

The casual use of my name makes my skin crawl. How does he know it? How long have I been here?

""Who the hell are you?"" My voice comes out rougher than I intended, scraped raw.

""Dr. Marcus Chen. And you're in a very special place."" He pulls up a small metal stool, settling himself just close enough to make me uncomfortable. ""You've been through quite an ordeal, haven't you? That creature you encountered‚Äîwe've been tracking it for weeks.""

""Where's Luke?""

His expression doesn't change, but something flickers behind his eyes. ""Your companion is being treated. His injuries were... extensive.""

""I want to see him.""

""I'm afraid that's not possible right now."" He adjusts his glasses, the gesture somehow making him look more predatory. ""But let's focus on you. You showed remarkable resilience out there. Survival instincts like yours are exactly what we're looking for.""

The word 'looking' sits wrong in my mind. ""For what?""

""To help rebuild. To create something better than what we lost."" His voice takes on the fervor of a true believer. ""The old world failed, Alex. Weak. Unprepared. But from its ashes, we can forge something stronger.""

I think of Luke's hands pulling me from the wreckage of that bus. His voice in the dark, teaching me how to stay alive. The way he never asked for thanks, never made me feel like dead weight. That's true¬†***strength***. Not whatever sterile nightmare this man is peddling.

""You're insane.""

His smile never wavers. ""I prefer '*visionary*.' Now, I need you to remain calm while we begin the preliminary assessments. The restraints are for your own safety‚Äîthe medication can cause disorientation.""

""What medication?""

But he's already standing, moving toward the door. ""Rest now. Tomorrow we begin in earnest.""

The lock clicks behind him, leaving me alone with the flickering light and the smell of chemicals masquerading as cleanliness.

I lie still for a long moment, listening. Footsteps fade down what sounds like a long corridor. Somewhere in the distance, machinery hums. And underneath it all, if I strain, I can hear something else‚Äîvoices, maybe. Or screaming.

The strap on my left wrist has seen better days. The leather is cracked, worn thin in places. Whoever buckled it didn't account for how much weight I've lost since the world ended. I work my thumb against the metal, feeling for give.

Luke's voice echoes in my memory:¬†*Always look for the weakness. Every system has one.*

The buckle shifts. Just a fraction, but enough. I twist my wrist, ignoring the bite of leather against bone, until my hand slips free. The relief is immediate and dizzying.

The other straps follow more easily. When I sit up, the room spins like a carnival ride, and bile rises in my throat. I grip the edges of the metal table until my knuckles go white, breathing through my nose until the worst of it passes.

A medical cart sits beside the table, loaded with supplies. Gauze, bandages, bottles of clear liquid with labels I can't pronounce. And there, nestled between the ordinary medical supplies like it belongs‚Äî

A syringe filled with electric blue liquid.

The label makes my blood run cold:

*NEURAL ENHANCEMENT SERUM - BATCH 7*¬†*For cognitive acceleration and pain suppression*¬†*WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL - Effects unknown*¬†*Administer only to consenting subjects*¬†***WARNING:***¬†***DOSES OVER 10ML MAY LEAD TO DEATH***¬†

Consenting. Right.

But beneath my fear, something else stirs. If this is what they plan to pump into me anyway, maybe I can control when and how. Maybe I can use it.

Luke always said knowledge was the best weapon. Even poisoned knowledge.

I hate needles. The sight of them makes my stomach turn and my hands shake. But I hate being helpless more.

The syringe is cold in my palm. The blue liquid inside seems to glow with its own light, like something from a nightmare. I think of Luke‚Äîhis steady hands when everything around us was chaos, his voice cutting through my panic:¬†*Do what you have to do to survive.*

I find a vein on my inner arm, press the needle against skin that's already marked by too many small traumas, and push the plunger. Making sure not to go over the 10ml mark still leaving over 40ml

Fire races through my veins.

At first, nothing

¬†But then the world explodes into sensation‚Äîevery nerve ending suddenly alive and screaming. Colors become too bright, sounds too sharp. I can hear my own heartbeat like thunder in my ears, feel the individual fibers of the bandages against my skull.

My knees buckle. Bile floods my mouth, and I barely manage to turn my head before vomiting across the floor. The pain is beyond description‚Äîlike being turned inside out while lightning courses through my bones.

Then, as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

The silence is deafening.

I'm still on my hands and knees, still shaking, but something has changed. The room is clearer now, edges sharper. I can hear conversations through the concrete walls, detect the subtle electronic hum of surveillance equipment.

And I can think. God, I can think with a clarity that's almost frightening.

Footsteps in the corridor. Moving fast.

Time to go.

Chp.3

The footsteps are getting closer.

I grab the syringe‚Äîstill well over half-full of that electric blue poison, and press myself against the wall beside the door. My enhanced hearing picks up every detail: the soft squeak of rubber soles on linoleum, the rustle of a lab coat, the slight wheeze in someone's breathing.

The lock clicks. The door swings inward.

Dr. Chen steps through, eyes immediately going to the empty metal slab. In the split second it takes him to process what he's seeing‚Äîthe undone restraints, the pool of vomit on the floor‚ÄîI move.

My hand clamps down on his shoulder, spinning him toward me. His eyes widen behind those wire-rimmed glasses, mouth opening to shout, but I'm already driving the needle deep into the side of his neck. The plunger slides home with a soft click.

""What did you‚Äî"" His words dissolve into a strangled gasp.

Whatever that blue serum does, it works fast. His legs buckle, hands clawing at his throat as convulsions wrack his body. I shove past him, snatching my jacket and shirt from the chair. The fabric feels foreign against my hypersensitive skin, every fiber amplified.

Chen hits the floor hard, retching and twitching. I don't wait to see if he recovers.

The hallway beyond stretches in both directions‚Äîsterile white walls broken by identical doors with small observation windows. The air reeks of industrial disinfectant trying to mask something much worse underneath. Blood. Fear. Death.

At the far end, one door stands different from the rest. Tinted glass instead of clear, and behind it, a faint glow that makes my stomach clench with dread.

""A... Alex...""

The voice is barely a whisper, but I'd know it anywhere. Luke.

I run toward the sound, my bare feet silent on the cold linoleum. Through the tinted glass, I can make out shapes‚Äîmedical equipment, monitoring devices, and in the center, a figure strapped to a table that's been tilted nearly vertical.

The door isn't locked. Why would it be? Who would be stupid enough to break into this place?

The smell hits me first when I step inside‚Äîcopper and antiseptic and something sweet that makes bile rise in my throat. Then I see him.

What they've done to Luke.

His face is a map of fresh cuts and old bruises, blood crusted in his blond hair. They've stripped him to the waist, and his chest is a canvas of precise incisions‚Äînot random violence, but methodical exploration. Clinical. His left hand is bandaged, but I can see where his thumb used to be.

But it's his eyes that break me. Those ice-blue eyes that used to be so steady, so sure‚Äînow they're hollow. Defeated.

""I... I'm sorry,"" he croaks when he sees me.

""For what?"" I move to his restraints, fingers working the buckles with desperate efficiency.

""I told them... everything."" A tear cuts a clean path through the grime on his cheek. ""Your name. Where we've been. The others in your group. I couldn't... I'm sorry.""

The betrayal should hurt. Should make me angry. But all I feel is relief that he's alive, and rage at what they've done to him.

""We'll deal with that later,"" I tell him, my voice steadier than I feel. ""Right now, we're getting you out of here.""

The last restraint comes free, and Luke's weight sags against me. He's lost too much blood, too much strength. When I try to help him stand, his legs give out immediately.

""I can't..."" he gasps.

""Yes, you can."" But even as I say it, I know it's not true. I ease him down against the wall, his head lolling back.

The cold kiss of metal against the base of my skull freezes every muscle in my body.

""Step away from him."" Dr. Chen's voice, but wrong somehow. Slurred. The serum should have dropped him for hours. If not, kill him.

I turn my head just enough to see him in my peripheral vision. He's upright, but barely. Blood runs from his nose, and his hands shake violently. Whatever that blue stuff does to enhance the human nervous system, it's tearing him apart from the inside.

""You should be unconscious,"" I say.

His laugh is wet and broken. ""Enhanced... metabolism. Part of the... program."" He presses the gun harder against my skull. ""Now step away, or I put a bullet through your enhanced brain.""

""Okay."" I raise my hands, moving slowly away from Luke.

""The serum worked faster than we expected,"" Chen continues, his voice gaining strength as he talks. ""Accelerated healing, increased pain tolerance, cognitive enhancement. You're already becoming something more than human.""

More than human. The words should terrify me, but instead, I feel a cold clarity settling over my thoughts. Every detail of the room becomes sharp and clear‚Äîthe distance to the gun, the tremor in Chen's hands, the way Luke's breathing has become shallow and labored.

""I'm going to enjoy dissecting you piece by piece,"" Chen snarls. ""After I kill your friend, of course. Can't have loose ends.""

Luke's eyes meet mine. Even broken, even dying, there's still fight in them. Still the man who pulled me from burning wreckage and taught me how to survive.

He moves.

Despite the pain, despite the blood loss, Luke's good hand snaps out and grabs Chen's ankle. The doctor stumbles, cursing, and I feel the gun's pressure leave my skull for just an instant.

It's enough.

I spin and drive my shoulder into Chen's midsection, slamming him back against the medical equipment. Monitors crash to the floor in a shower of sparks. The gun flies from his grip, skittering across the floor toward Luke.

Chen recovers faster than he should, the serum in his system giving him unnatural resilience. His fist catches me across the jaw, and stars explode behind my eyes. But the enhanced metabolism works both ways‚ÄîI can feel my body processing the pain, compartmentalizing it.

We grapple, crashing into cabinets filled with surgical instruments. Glass shatters. Chen's elbow drives into my ribs, right where the fresh stitches pull against inflamed skin. I cry out, but don't let go.

Luke's fingers close around the pistol.

The gunshot is deafening in the enclosed space. Chen jerks backward, a bloom of red spreading across his white coat. He looks down at the wound in his abdomen with something like surprise.

""Code red,"" he gasps into a radio clipped to his collar. ""The subject has escaped. Lock down all exits.""

Then he collapses.

Keys spill from his pocket as he hits the floor. I grab them with shaking hands and turn back to Luke.

He's even paler now, if that's possible. The gun trembles in his grip.

""Go,"" he whispers.

""Not without you.""

""Look at me, Alex."" His voice carries the authority it always had, even now. ""Really look.""

I do. And I see what I've been refusing to acknowledge‚Äîthe gray pallor of his skin, the way his breathing hitches with every exhale, the spreading darkness beneath the bandages on his chest.

""You can't carry me,"" he continues. ""Not far enough. Not fast enough."" He shifts the gun, pressing it against his own chest. ""There are others who need you. People like us, still fighting. I'll buy you time.""

In the distance, I can hear them coming. Boots on linoleum. Shouts. The mechanical hum of doors sealing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre strong Alex, I know you will make it‚Äù

I¬†*need*¬†to tell him. I need him to¬†*know*. If this is the last time I'll ever see him then-

‚ÄúLuke I¬†***Lov..‚Äù***¬†

The first gunshot cracks from somewhere close by. Too close.

¬†""Go!"" The word comes out like a command, like the soldier he used to be. His eyes are clear now, focused. ""Make it count.""

I run.

The corridors blur past in a maze of white walls and fluorescent lighting. The keys Chen dropped fit the first exit I found‚Äîheavy steel doors that open onto a loading dock. Rain hammers down from a black sky, washing the sterile smell of the facility from my lungs.

A parking area spreads before me, vehicles arranged in neat rows. I hit the unlock button on the key fob, and somewhere to my left, headlights flash.

I sprint toward the sound, rain soaking through my clothes in seconds. Behind me, the facility erupts in noise‚Äîalarms, shouting, the crack of gunfire.

Luke, I‚Äôm sorry

I slide into the driver's seat of what turns out to be a black SUV, hands shaking as I jam the key into the ignition. The engine roars to life. I throw it into drive and floor the accelerator.

That's when I see it.

A figure stands directly in my path, tall and impossibly thin. Even through the rain-streaked windshield, I can see that its proportions are all wrong‚Äîlimbs too long, joints bending in directions they shouldn't. Its head jerks and twitches like a marionette with tangled strings.

This isn't one of the infected from the city. This is something else. Something worse.

It glides toward the SUV with fluid, predatory grace.

I slam the gear shift into reverse, tires screaming on wet asphalt. The creature moves faster than anything has a right to, flowing across the pavement like liquid shadow. It leaps, landing on the hood with a wet thud that spider-webs the windshield.

Through the fractured glass, I see its face‚Äîor what's left of it. Skin stretched taut over elongated bones, eye sockets black and empty, and a mouth that tears open far wider than human anatomy should allow.

I jam the transmission into drive and hit the gas.

The SUV lurches forward, tires fighting for purchase on the slick pavement. The creature's claws rake across the windshield, but the sudden acceleration sends it tumbling off the hood. In the rearview mirror, I watch it roll and come up in a crouch, already preparing to give chase.

I don't slow down.

The facility's gate looms ahead‚Äîchain link topped with razor wire. But the SUV is heavy and moving fast. Metal screams and sparks fly as I punch through, fragments of fence clattering across the roof.

Behind me, muzzle flashes light up the rain. Someone is still shooting, still fighting.

Luke.

Every instinct screams at me to turn around, to go back and help him. But his voice echoes in my head, as clear as if he were sitting beside me:¬†***Don't waste your life. Make it count.***

The road stretches ahead, black and endless, disappearing into the storm. I grip the steering wheel tighter and press down on the accelerator.

Rain mixes with the tears on my cheeks, and somewhere behind me in the darkness, the gunfire finally stops.

Chap 4.

The windshield wipers beat a steady rhythm against the storm‚Äî*thump-scrape, thump-scrape*‚Äîand my enhanced brain immediately catalogues the sound: 72 beats per minute. The same rate as Luke's heart when he was calm. When he used to sleep beside me in whatever shelter we'd found, his breathing was deep and even, one hand always resting near his weapon.

I grip the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white against black leather. The enhanced cognition won't let me push the memory away. Instead, it sharpens every detail with surgical precision: the way his chest rose and fell that last morning, the exact angle of sunlight across his face, the small scar above his left eyebrow from when he'd shielded me from flying glass three months ago.

Seventy-two beats per minute. Now zero.

The SUV's engine note changes as I crest a hill, and even that simple sound triggers a cascade of memory. Luke's voice explaining how to listen to engines, how to tell when one was about to fail: ""It'll sound different, Alex. Trust your ears‚Äîthey'll save your life when your eyes can't.""

My foot slams on the brake.

The SUV skids sideways on the rain-slick asphalt before coming to rest at an angle across both lanes. I'm gasping, hyperventilating, my enhanced nervous system processing oxygen at an accelerated rate that leaves me dizzy and nauseated.

Through the fractured windshield, I can see an abandoned gas station maybe fifty yards ahead. Dark windows, weeds growing through cracks in the concrete, gas pumps standing like sentinels over a graveyard of the old world.

I need to stop. I need to think. Need to‚Äî

*""I told them everything.""*

Luke's words echo with perfect clarity, and my enhanced brain immediately begins dissecting them. Vocal stress analysis indicates shame, regret, but underlying determination. Micro-expression review: tightening around his eyes suggested he was lying about something. Heart rate elevated beyond what physical trauma alone would cause.

The realization hits like ice water in my veins.

He was protecting me.

My enhanced cognition starts running calculations, probability matrices based on interrogation psychology and Luke's behavioral patterns. Ninety-three percent chance he fed them false information. Eighty-seven percent chance he deliberately prolonged his own suffering to buy me time. Seventy-four percent chance he never broke at all‚Äîjust made them think he had.

I slam my fist against the dashboard, and the impact sends lightning up my arm. Even pain feels different now, sharper and more immediate, but also strangely manageable. As if the serum has rewired my relationship with suffering.

The gas station wavers in my vision. I put the SUV in drive and coast toward it, pulling around behind the building where the SUV won't be visible from the road. My hands shake as I turn off the engine.

Silence rushes in to fill the space left by mechanical noise.

I lean my forehead against the steering wheel and close my eyes, but that only makes it worse. With visual input elimiTristond, my enhanced hearing picks up everything: rain drumming against the roof in an irregular pattern that my brain immediately starts trying to decode for meaning, the subtle tick of cooling metal, my own heartbeat thundering at 127 beats per minute.

Nearly twice Luke's resting rate. Twice what his will ever be again.

The sob that tears from my throat doesn't sound human. It's raw, animal, the sound of something breaking beyond repair. But even as grief wracks my body, part of my enhanced mind remains coldly analytical, observing my own breakdown with clinical detachment.

Crying duration: four minutes, thirty-seven seconds. Respiratory rate: elevated. Probable psychological trauma manifesting through enhanced emotional processing. Recommendation: compartmentalize for later analysis.

I want to scream at that calculating voice in my head, but I can't. Because it's me now. This is what the serum has made me‚Äîa thing that can perfectly remember every moment of loss while simultaneously treating it like a data point to be filed away.

I remember the needle sliding into Luke's neck. Remember the exact pressure required to depress the plunger. Remember the way his pupils dilated as the blue liquid entered his bloodstream, the specific shade of gray his skin turned as the serum began its work.

But wait.

That's wrong.

I sit up straighter, blinking rain from my eyes. I injected Chen, not Luke. Luke was already dying when I found him, already broken by whatever they'd done during his interrogation. The enhanced memory is perfect, incapable of error, and it shows me the truth with crystalline clarity:

Luke died from his wounds. From torture. From blood loss.

Not from anything I did.

So why does it feel like I killed him?

The answer comes with the cold logic of enhanced cognition: because I chose to leave. I calculated the odds, weighed the variables, and decided his life was an acceptable loss to ensure my own survival. My enhanced brain had processed the tactical situation in milliseconds and reached the optimal conclusion.

Luke would have called it the right choice. He'd trained me to make decisions like that, to put survival above sentiment. But the human part of me‚Äîwhatever's left of it‚Äîknows better.

***I LEFT HIM TO DIE ALONE.***

The rain is letting up, and in the growing quiet, I can hear something else: the distant throb of helicopter rotors. They're looking for me. Of course they are. Whatever that facility was, whoever was running it, they wouldn't just let their enhanced test subject walk away.

I should move. Should find cover, put distance between myself and any pursuit. The logical thing to do.

Instead, I sit in the SUV behind an abandoned gas station and try to remember what it felt like to be human.

Luke's final words echo in my enhanced memory:¬†*""There are others who need you. People like us, still fighting.""*

He'd given me a mission. Purpose. Something to do with the poison they'd pumped into my veins, something to justify the thing I'm becoming.

But as I start the engine and pull back onto the empty highway, I can't shake the feeling that the person Luke died protecting is already gone. The enhanced cognition, the accelerated healing, the perfect memory‚Äîthey're not additions to who I was.

They're replacements.

The helicopter sounds are getting closer. Time to disappear into the wasteland and figure out what I am now. What I'm supposed to do with this curse disguised as a gift.

The road stretches ahead, black and endless, and somewhere out there, people are still fighting. Still hoping. Still believing that humanity is worth saving.

I press down on the accelerator and try to remember why I once believed that too.

Behind me, the gas station fades into the storm, and with it, the last place where the old Alex existed. Whatever drives north into the darkness, it's something else entirely.

Something enhanced.

Something lost.

CHP 5.

The deer doesn't hear me coming.

Two weeks ago, that would have been impossible. I was loud, clumsy‚Äîhuman. Now I move through the forest without disturbing a single leaf, my feet finding purchase on ground that should crunch and snap under my weight. The deer continues grazing, unaware that death stands fifteen feet away.

I've been hunting for three days. Not because I'm hungry‚Äîthat's another thing that's changed. Food tastes like ash now, and I can go longer without eating than should be possible. I hunt because something inside me craves it. Something that whispers in frequencies I shouldn't be able to hear.

The bow I scavenged from an abandoned sporting goods store feels natural in my hands, like I've used one for years instead of hours. My enhanced‚Äîno, that's not the right word anymore‚Äîmy¬†*changed*¬†vision tracks the deer's pulse point beneath its fur. I can see the blood moving under its skin, can hear its heart beating from here.

Seventy-eight beats per minute.

Faster than Luke's resting rate. Slower than his final moments.

I draw the bowstring back, and that's when I notice my hands.

The fingernails are longer than they were yesterday. Sharper. There are faint marks on my palms‚Äîridges that weren't there before, patterns that look almost like scales. When I flex my fingers, the joints move with too much flexibility, bending at angles that make my stomach turn.

The deer's head snaps up. Its eyes meet mine across the clearing, and what I see there makes me lower the bow.

Terror. Pure, instinctual terror.

It's not looking at me like I'm a human with a weapon. It's looking at me like I'm a predator it's never encountered before, something its species evolved to fear on a genetic level. The deer's pupils dilate, its breath comes in short, panicked bursts, and then it bolts‚Äînot just away from me, but away from what I'm becoming.

I watch it disappear into the underbrush, my enhanced hearing tracking its flight long after it vanishes from sight. Part of me wants to follow. The rational, human part.

But there's another part now. A part that whispers about the chase, about running prey to ground, about the warm taste of fresh blood. A part that knows exactly how far the deer will run before exhaustion takes it, knows which path it will choose, knows how to cut it off.

I force myself to turn away.

The abandoned cabin I've been using as shelter sits in a small clearing maybe half a mile back. I found it four days ago‚Äîwindows boarded up, door hanging off its hinges, clearly empty for years. Perfect for someone who needs to hide from both human hunters and whatever else might be out there.

The walk back should take fifteen minutes. I make it in seven without consciously trying to move faster.

Inside, I've set up a crude living space: sleeping bag in the corner, my remaining supplies stacked against one wall, a small mirror propped against the windowsill. It's the mirror I head for now, dreading what I'll see but unable to stop myself.

The face looking back at me is still recognizably mine, but wrong in subtle ways. My cheekbones are more pronounced, my jaw slightly elongated. My eyes‚ÄîGod, my eyes. The iris has developed flecks of gold that seem to move in the light, and sometimes I swear I can see things in my peripheral vision that aren't there when I turn to look directly.

But it's my mouth that makes me step back from the mirror.

My teeth are changing.

The canines are longer, sharper. When I run my tongue over them, I taste blood where they've cut the inside of my cheek. Behind them, I can feel other teeth shifting, reshaping themselves for purposes I don't want to think about.

I grab the med kit I took from the SUV and pull out a small flashlight, using it to examine my mouth more closely. What I see makes my knees weak.

It's not just the teeth. The roof of my mouth has developed ridges, and my tongue‚Äîwhen did my tongue get so long? When I extend it fully, it reaches past my chin. The surface is rough now, covered in tiny barbs that scrape against my lips.

I drop the flashlight. It hits the floor and rolls under the table, beam spinning wild patterns across the cabin walls.

This isn't enhancement. This is transformation.

My mind races back to the facility, to Dr. Chen's words: ""Neural Enhancement Serum."" But that was a lie, wasn't it? Or at best, a half-truth. They weren't enhancing my brain‚Äîthey were activating something that was already inside me.

Something that wasn't human.

I sink onto the sleeping bag, hands shaking as I pull up my shirt to examine the surgical site. The stitches are gone‚Äîmy body absorbed them days ago‚Äîbut the scar remains. It's not the clean line of a simple incision anymore. The tissue has formed a complex pattern, almost like...

Like it's covering something underneath.

I press my fingers against the scar tissue, and pain lances through my side. But underneath the pain, I can feel something else. Movement. A rhythmic pulsing that doesn't match my heartbeat.

Oh God.

They put something inside me. During the surgery, while I was unconscious, they implanted something. And the serum didn't enhance me‚Äîit woke it up.

I remember the creature outside the facility. The way it moved, fluid and wrong. The way its face was stretched and distorted. The rage in its empty eye sockets when it saw me.

It knew. It recognized what I was becoming.

I scramble for my backpack, pulling out the small notebook I've been keeping. My handwriting from two weeks ago looks foreign now, the letters too rounded, too human. I flip to a blank page and start writing, trying to document the changes:

*Day 14: Fingernails 1.2cm longer than baseline. Joint flexibility increased approximately 40%. Dietary needs are reduced. Sleep requirements decreased to 3-4 hours.*

*Day 14 (cont.): Dental modifications progressing. Canines extended 0.8cm. Additional tooth buds detected behind molars. Tongue length increased significantly.*

*Day 14 (cont.): Surgical site active. Unknown implant responding to serum activation. Purpose unclear.*

I will stop writing. The clinical tone is wrong, too detached. This isn't a medical journal‚Äîit's a horror story. My horror story.

*I'm turning into one of them.*

That's the truth I've been avoiding for two weeks. All the enhanced cognition, the perfect memory, the improved reflexes‚Äîthey're not gifts. They're symptoms. I'm becoming whatever that creature was, and there's no way to stop it.

Luke's voice echoes in my memory: ""There are others who need you. People like us, still fighting.""

But what if I can't help them? What if I'm becoming the thing they need to fight against?

Outside, something moves through the underbrush. My head snaps toward the sound before I consciously register it. Whatever's out there is big, moving with deliberate purpose rather than the random wandering of infected.

***Humans***.

I can smell them now‚Äîsweat, fear, the metallic tang of weapons. Three of them, maybe four, approaching from the east. Their heart beats thunder in my ears like war drums.

Part of me wants to run. To grab my gear and disappear deeper into the forest before they can find me.

But another part‚Äîthe part with too-long teeth and skin that's starting to feel too tight‚Äîwants to see what they taste like.

I clamp my hands over my mouth, horrified by my own thoughts. The human part of me is screaming, but it's getting quieter every day. Soon, it might not be strong enough to hold the other part back.

The footsteps are getting closer. I need to decide: hide from them, or let them find me and hope there's enough of Alex left to warn them about what I'm becoming.

Through the boarded windows, I can see flashlight beams cutting through the growing darkness.

Time to find out which part of me is stronger.

It‚Äôs the same trip every year, and this year I ( 37F ) decided not to go. I had a busy week at work and we had just taken a really fun separate trip, so I was happy to stay home. So for the week I‚Äôm home alone with our animals. Two cats, a tortoise, and two snakes. My fianc√©e, let‚Äôs call him Stew, has always been into reptiles. It was a dream of his to own a giant snake, so when we moved in together a few years ago, he was finally able to purchase a baby reticulated python. This is the largest specie of snake in the world. She‚Äôs nowhere near full grown, but during the time of this story, she was approximately 9 feet long. To paint the picture, she‚Äôs bright orange/yellow. Let‚Äôs call her ( the snake ) Clementine. Picture that famous Brittney spears performance where she was holding the snake. 
The other snake is irrelevant to this story. 

Okay, so my only task as far as watching the snakes go, was to make sure they were alive and to make sure Clementine‚Äôs""fogger"" was working to keep her cage at the proper humidity level, No problem. I don‚Äôt have to feed them, hold them, nothing out of my comfort zone. 
So, day ONE, I noticed Clementine‚Äôs cage was open just slightly. A common practice to keep humidity at the appropriate level. 
She is very content in her enclosure and the door was only left ajar about an inch so this doesn't worry me to much. I assumed Stew left it like this on purpose. I have no way to confirm this, because Stew is currently far up in the mountains with no cell service. 
A few days pass with no issue. I continue to check on her and she seems okay. 

Then all hell break loose‚Ä¶
The final day before he comes home, I wake up to an actual crime scene in my living room. 
Plants knocked over‚Ä¶ drops of blood on the kitchen floor. One of my cats has a gash on her head, the other looking very rattled. OH MY GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED!?
My first thought was maybe the cats got into a fight with each other?? 

So I pour myself a cup of coffee and start to pick up the debris from the floor. Then I see it. The snake cage is now open WAY more. About 6 inches. I look closer and sure enough, cage is empty. 
Clementine, the 9 foot long python, got out of her cage. An important note, I am not really a snake person, so I‚Äôm not comfortable handling her when stew is not around. I tried to take her out of her cage by myself once, and she tried to bite me. That was the end of that. 

Pure panic consumes me. 
She‚Äôs in the house somewhere. Oh dear. I start to assess the situation.
Cats are alive but acting very on edge. Makes sense. One has a puncture wound on her head!! Oh no!!! Oh FUCK.
This is bad. 
So I start looking. Under the couch, behind the furniture, anywhere this snake could fit‚Ä¶
Looking, my heart rate increasing, I can‚Äôt find her. 
Questioning my own sanity because I can‚Äôt figure out where she is. She has to be in the house somewhere!! 

Then I see it. 
A small hole in one of our window screens. A perfect snake sized hole. 
NO. NO. NO. 
She‚Äôs outside. 
MAYDAY, WE NOW HAVE A PYTHON LOOSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. 

This is not what I want to be doing at 6:00AM. 
So I go outside, start searching. 20 minutes pass and she‚Äôs nowhere to be found‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm starting to panic even more because I‚Äôm going to have to tell Stew that I lost his snake. 
My emotions are swinging from anger that he LEFT HER CAGE OPEN, to sadness, to determination. 
I make a decision then and there to dedicate my day to finding this snake. 
I will find her. 
I might have to call into work BUT I won‚Äôt rest until this snake has been located. 
So I persist. Searching in bushes, up in trees, under cars. You name it. 

At approximately the 45 min mark, it happens. 
I‚Äôm now in our backyard ( THANK GOD ) 
and around the side of the house completely opposite of where she escaped from, and move a large piece of wood, and BOOM there she is. 
Hiding in a pile of discarded wood, weeds and vines. 

Thank goodness. She‚Äôs alive and well. I swear she even looked at me with an amused look in her eye. She got a taste of freedom‚Ä¶.Now I just have to untangle her from the vines and wrangle her out. 
I can do this! Right..? 

The last time I tried to grab her on my own without Stew around, she tried to bite me. 
I must prevail. I have to get this snake back inside. I will not let you down Stew. 

I come up with my plan. 
I‚Äôll make sure she‚Äôs aware of me, show her I‚Äôm not a threat, and then make my move. 
Plan in motion. I let her smell me, I‚Äôm giving her positive words of affirmation. 

It takes me a few minutes but I work up the courage to grab her from the backside. She‚Äôs trying to slither away but I use my strength and dominance and get her up over my shoulders. 

I did it!!! 
Rushing back into the house I quickly get her to her cage and encourage her in. 

She‚Äôs in. Thank God. One whole heart attack later and this snake is safe. 
Her only wound is a very large scratch on her head that I determined was the cat. Who also had a battle scar. They must have gotten into a fight when she first escaped, hence the blood on the floor from the very beginning of the story. 

I slept through a literal nightmare happening in my living room‚Ä¶..The poor cats were undoubtedly meowing for help. I‚Äôm the end, all pets were completely okay! The scratches were just surface wounds. A bit of psychological trauma for the cats, but I‚Äôve done my best to make up for it. Lots of pets, treats, and cuddles. They are totally okay. 
And Clementine, got a taste of unsupervised freedom. 
And Stew left the cage open BY ACCIDENT. ",1,1755096452.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1mp6hkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1mp6hkb/my_girlfriend_25f_has_been_jealous_of_a_gay_male/,"My Girlfriend [25F] has been jealous of a gay male friend I [29M] have, for almost a year now.","Really need some grounded advice, this entire experience has been incredibly uncomfortable for me and has made me feel the full range of emotions and at this point the issue comes up once a month for almost an entire year and it never gets better. 

I feel isolated as I don't really have people to talk to about this with. After we talk about this subject she is able to understand and not shame me about it but over time it keeps repeating in the same way and I am starting to feel crazy. 

Essentially when we first started dating, my bestfriend was a gay man. Obviously he and I were very close and he knew me extremely well. I think my GF seeing this in the beginning brought up feelings of inadequacy as he knew how to make me laugh and feel comfortable and I think my girlfriend felt  threatened by this.   
  
There was one night that everything turned for the worse when I got too drunk while us three were at an event. I was just laughing and hanging out more with him and she felt betrayed by this. My friend is one of the boys and obviously the banter and fun I have with my male friends is different then how I am in partnership but that is why I value my male friendships so much and it wasn't anything deeper then that. 

I take accountability that I was not prioritizing her that evening or making her feel as included as I should have been, but it was an honest mistake and I have a history of drinking too much and have pretty much stopped since then to avoid that kind of situation happening again. 

This triggered the next year of her questioning about my sexuality, what I actually want. Her wondering if I am gay and don't know my self that well. I have come a long way with becoming comfortable in my masculinity. I am in touch with my feminine side and have always had close women and gay friends. They allow me to feel safe to be open up with my emotions in a way I am more closed off with straight men. However I am very much a straight man and have very good straight male friendships as well, just different people help me express different parts of my self. 

So me feeling really solid in my sexuality and who i am as a person, getting questioned over and over really messed with me head. How could this person not hear what I was saying? And the thing is, she does believe me. She will get to a point where she feels guilty for bringing it up and we can kinda put it to rest until it comes up again. 

It has made me feel resentful when my gay friend does nice things for me or gets me a book he thinks I would like. It feels like he has caused so many issues in our relationship and at one point I just wanted to tell him I cant be friends any more because I was so upset about this. 

It brought up my feelings of shame and a want to keep things from my girlfriend, cause if he got me a gift or did something nice for me, I know it would bring up this whole thing up again and I just really am over it at this point. 

For me I can see it very clearly. Everyone has their issues they bring into a relationship, I get that. I have my shit too. It's a part of dating, no one is perfect. For my girlfriend the only thing that is really an issue is her jealously. After she gets over the momentary jealousy of my gay friend, she will identify some women in my life to become jealous over, even if that women is a barista at a coffee shop I go to. 

And the jealousy isn't necessarily a toxic variety. And what I mean by that is, I don't respond well when someone is accusing me of something or that I am somehow being deceitful. That's not it. The jealously comes from a place of her identifying someone who she thinks would actually be better for me and would actually be who I need to be with and it makes her feel sad and inadequate. I feel empathetic for this, cause she is not calling me out, she just is failing to see her value and all the things she brings to the table that no one else can.   
  
But when it goes so far as being jealous of women I have never met. Women that are in her life that she thinks would be better for me, I can really see how this is HER trauma she is bringing to the table. 

And when my gay friend comes up again eventually, I try to explain how this is a part of the bigger pattern of jealously. But she often feels like I am dismissing her and calling her emotional when her ""intuition"" is telling her something. 

I keep encouraging her to go talk to her therapist about this because at this point I have been patient and understanding for a entire year. Right around a certain time of the month, I will get a text like, ""Hey I really want to put this thing with \[Gay Friend\] to rest, I 100% trust you I just dont understand some things"" and I'm starting to get extremely upset as it does not matter what I say, it keeps happening in a loop. I feel insane. 

Honestly it has been a big red flag for me that we have not been able to get through this an entire year later but I love her so damn much and everything else about our relationship is great. It just feels like it is out of my control and I don't know how to address it, nothing seems to work. Every productive conversation about it is only a momentary lapse before it comes up again. 

And we were planning to move in together at the end of this month and for me I have a real big hesitation about that considering this situation never resolving. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it, I have tried to be so patient and understanding for so long but nothing I do helps this situation. 

I need help figure out how to navigate this, resentment is building in me at this point and i'm becoming angry. I honestly want to set a boundary that I am not going to speak about it anymore and she needs to decide if that is going to be a deal breaker so we can move on with our lives. I don't understand why someone would want to move in with their partner that they unconsciously don't trust.   
  
She has been through alot of trauma, one of her partners died when they were dating. She dated lots of poly people who choose another women. So I get where the fear of loss comes from. I'm empathetic and understanding. It has just gotten to a point that I feel like she actually is mentally unwell and talking about this isnt going to get anywhere. I have to decide if I want to put up with this or she needs to seriously get help.   
  
I just don't know what to do and I feel so isolated in a bubble that I need insight and help on this matter.   
  
Sorry for the long read. I really appreciate you for reading it and if you have anything that might help or perspectives I could look into. Thank you.  ",1,1755096425.0,relationshipadvice,5,1.0,False
1mp6hh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDressUp/comments/1mp6hh1/unpopular_opinion_ironing_is_overrated_for/,Unpopular opinion: Ironing is overrated for everyday style. Prove me wrong.,"I'll admit it: I rarely iron. I think for most daily outfits, a little bit of wrinkling adds character and is honestly unavoidable unless you're encased in plastic wrap. Obviously, for critically important events or professions requiring a sharp look, ironing is essential. But for running errands, grabbing coffee, or just hanging out, is it really necessary?

I find that properly folding or hanging clothes immediatly after drying substantially reduces wrinkles. Plus, steamers are a fantastic alternative for slightly more stubborn creases.

I started about a month and a half ago and have come to realize it causes more stress as well as waste to be offering smoothies on my menu. 
The first reason is that I am not adequately equipped to be making them. I have a shitty blender that is from walmart and is not even close to commercial grade. 
I recently started freezing the fruit i brought up from the kitchen because it would go bad before someone even ordered a smoothie ( not a common order)
because it is not a common order i am usually unprepared- i don't have bananas or yogurt, and they gave me no basic recipes to even make the smoothies. i do not have adequate materials to properly clean the blender either because all i have is a regular sink, dish soap and a hand sponge so the blades get really gross fast. 
it also takes a lot of time to make them and i work by myself. I made one today and the person in line had to wait while i was making a smoothie when all she wanted was an iced coffee. 

I just feel like it is not necessary to be offering smoothies up here. it makes my life much more difficult and the very few people who still ask for them only do because they know it used to be on the menu ( i took it off the off of the actual menu). It also is just awkward when i hand them a smoothie that is just not very good that they could have made at home probably better. 

Does your cafe offer smoothies? any suggestions of how to convince my boss to officially stop offering them? or suggestions on how to make my life a little easier around making them? ",12,1755096407.0,barista,6,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been incorporating the Her Fantasy Box Body Magic Chlorophyll Capsules into my daily routine, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an interesting journey. This product, boasting detoxification, gut health benefits, digestive support, and even skin improvement, intrigued me. As someone constantly chasing natural wellness solutions, these capsules certainly fit the bill.

**Design and Convenience**

The packaging is compact, measuring 2 x 2 x 4.25 inches and weighing just 1.44 ounces. I liked how it can easily slip into my bag, desk drawer, or even a jacket pocket. The bottle design is straightforward; a no-fuss twist-off cap keeps it practical. The capsules themselves are moderately sized, making them easy to swallow compared to some gigantic supplements I‚Äôve tried in the past. Being vegan and non-GMO is also a massive win for inclusivity across dietary preferences.

**Health Benefits Explored**

These capsules target an impressive range of health concerns‚Äîdetoxification, digestion, and even odor control. Over the weeks, I started noticing improvements in how ‚Äúclean‚Äù my body felt. While that sounds abstract, what I mean is better gut regularity and a noticeable reduction in my usual bloating after meals. One feature that stood out is its odor-controlling capability. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd notice a difference, but I did! After just a week, issues like occasional bad breath (thanks to coffee) and funkiness from sweaty workouts were pretty much gone. It‚Äôs wildly effective, bordering on miraculous, though I wouldn‚Äôt place all blame for odors entirely on nature‚Äôs chemistry.

[Check Her Fantasy Box B0CJYJR7KG price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0cjyjr7kg/)

**Daily Use and Consumption Experience**

These capsules are incredibly convenient. I‚Äôve tried liquid chlorophyll before, and let me tell you, the taste can be horrendous. These capsules bypass that problem altogether. A single pill is all it takes daily, and with plenty of water, it‚Äôs a painless addition to my morning routine. The recommended dosage fits seamlessly into busy lifestyles, though I wish the product included clearer guidelines about timing‚Äîmorning, evening, with meals, or on an empty stomach?

**Strengths**

- Vegan and Non-GMO capsules meet a variety of dietary preferences.
- Helps reduce body odors naturally, acting as a subtle internal deodorant.
- Promotes detoxification and gut health without requiring additional dietary changes.
- Compact, travel-friendly packaging adds convenience.
- Eliminates chemical additives, prioritizing natural ingredients.

**Flaws**

- The lack of precise timing instructions for consumption could confuse some users.
- A faint taste of chlorophyll when swallowing, though it‚Äôs much better than liquid alternatives.
- Price feels slightly high compared to competitor offerings for similar features.
- Results for skin radiance and texture took more time to appear than gut improvements.

**Competing Products**

In terms of market rivals, there are other brands offering chlorophyll capsules and liquids. Liquid chlorophyll, for instance, might appeal to those who prefer immediate absorption, but the taste can make it unbearable for many. Some alternatives sacrifice purity for lower cost or add artificial fillers that don‚Äôt align with health-conscious users‚Äô priorities. I‚Äôve used liquid chlorophyll before, and this capsule form wins hands down in terms of ease, taste, and portability. Compared to higher-priced detox supplements, the Body Magic Chlorophyll Capsules strike a solid balance‚Äîthough a cheaper option might tempt budget-conscious buyers.

**True Value**

Cost-wise, these capsules might not be the cheapest on the market, yet their versatility makes them worth it for those seeking detoxification, odor control, and added health benefits like antioxidants. Paying for a multi-function product means you‚Äôre not buying separate solutions for each issue, which feels smart for your wallet in the long term. If I were to value it in ‚Äúprice-performance,‚Äù it definitely justifies its upfront cost, though waiting for periodic sales wouldn‚Äôt hurt.

All shots are 15g in 45g out, with 5s of lower pressure preinfusion, this is what I got so far:

* Grind size 3, 95‚Å∞C: very high and sharp acidity, not sourness but still high enough acidity to not be enjoyable; very slight hint of berries in the finish 
* Grind size 2.5, 95‚Å∞C: still high acidity but less than before, less sharp and more enjoyable, with some more noticeable sweet-ish berries notes; I'd prefer a less acidic shot but if all else fail, this is what I'll fall back to
* Grind size 2, 92‚Å∞C: acidity completely tamed, shot is smooth and round but flat and boring, with no real notes to taste
* Grind size 2, 95‚Å∞C: acidity is back, still no discernible tasting notes; it also starts to be a little too much, not yet bitter but too ""intense""

Now I think that the higher acidity is extracted by the higher temperature, so next shot will be at 92‚Å∞C, but what about grind size?

Would you try again grind size 2.5 but with the lower temp, or would you go finer to compensate for it?

Also, what about the ratio? With dark roasts I find easy to understand if I have to go longer or shorter, but with light roast that are naturally more acidic I have a hard time understanding if too much acidity/sourness can be mitigated by ratio or grind size

1mp6dfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mp6dfs/explore_the_best_shoe_washing_machine_bag_by_shoe/,Explore the Best Shoe Washing Machine Bag by Shoe Bag Brand,"The Shoe Bag for Washing Machine, specifically designed for gentle and efficient cleaning, recently found its way into my regular laundry routine. At first, I was skeptical about how a mere bag could enhance shoe washing in a machine without wreaking havoc on the appliance or the shoes themselves. However, after using it for a few weeks, I have a lot to share about its upsides and a few quirks that deserve attention.

**Convenient Design for Shoe Protection**  
The thoughtfully designed chenille microfibers lining this bag caught my attention immediately. With 3 cm long microfibers, the bag offers a 360¬∞ deep clean for shoes, allowing detergent and water to penetrate effectively. Unlike some randomly made mesh bags, this one felt like it was engineered to actually clean shoes while protecting them from damage during the wash cycle. My sneakers, which were previously stained from muddy trails, came out surprisingly pristine after one round. Great that it fits shoes of different sizes, from my large running pairs to my younger cousin‚Äôs kid-sized sneakers.  

[Grab Shoe Bag For Washing Machine Shoe Washing Machine Bag at the best price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0dcp9chb3/)

**Durable Build and Adjustable Options**  
The inclusion of two adjustable shoe stretchers within the packaging was a feature I didn‚Äôt know I needed but grew to appreciate immensely. They come with seven adjustable holes, allowing for customization based on the shoe‚Äôs length. This ensured my high-top trainers didn‚Äôt lose shape during the wash‚Äîand the bag wasn‚Äôt just compact in size but also felt premium and tear-resistant. The mesh material doesn‚Äôt just anchor shoes well but enables airflow and smooth water circulation, which meant they dried easier too when hung post-wash.  

**Invisible Zipper and Safety Considerations**  
The zipper mechanism deserves some applause. It comes equipped with a D-ring closure and an elastic protective cover for the zipper head. This little detail not only prevents the zipper from scratching the washing machine's drum but also keeps the bag securely shut throughout the cycle. I even tested it during a high-spinning cycle, and there wasn‚Äôt a single mishap. Additionally, the zipper material doesn‚Äôt rust, so that was a relief when I left the bag damp by accident one night.  

**Everyday Use is a Breeze**  
Those who spend a significant amount of time scrubbing sneakers by hand will appreciate how much time this bag saves. It works for all shoe types, from leather-form slip-ons to gym trainers. Simply load your shoes into the bag, toss in your favorite detergent, and let the washer do the rest. Ironically, I was able to spend my previously shoe-cleaning-dedicated time enjoying coffee instead. Also, having the option to hang this bag with its built-in loop provided a tidy storage solution post-use.

**Key Benefits**  
- Long chenille microfibers ensure shoes are deeply and gently cleaned.  
- Adjustable shoe stretchers keep shoes in shape while cleaning.  
- Rust-proof zipper with protective cover prevents damage to appliances.  
- Durable and breathable mesh supports effective cleaning.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The bag size might be a tight squeeze for men‚Äôs oversized boots‚Äîlarger footwear feels cramped.  
- Certain delicate materials like suede or hand-crafted leather may not be adequately shielded despite the good lining.  
- Zipper positioning requires a bit of fumbling initially to thread properly with the D-ring.

**Product Alternatives**  
Compared to other shoe laundry bags, this one clearly stands out with its high-quality chenille microfiber and durable mesh. Many alternatives focus solely on protecting shoes during a wash but fail to contribute to effective cleaning. One of the competing products, easily found in retail stores, uses thin netting, which isn‚Äôt as resilient for multiple cycles. Another similar product advertised extra storage but lacked adjustable features for shoe stability. Where this model raises the bar is the thoughtful inclusion of the shoe stretchers and the attention to appliance safety.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Shoe bags like these often fall into a disposable price-and-build category. This one, however, justifies its price with its long-lasting fabric, premium zippers, and multipurpose use. It‚Äôs not only affordable but also eliminates extra cleaning products or effort I would otherwise spend. Essentially, for less hassle and maintained shoes, this reusable bag appears worth the modest investment. Replacements might not even cross your mind for a long time, given its quality.

1mp6cgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tenant/comments/1mp6cgj/issue_with_landlord_or_aita_long_post/,Issue with Landlord or AITA (long post),"I moved to Boston for the first time last year with two roommates to attend school. When we signed our lease for the apartment, I didn't see any problems with the property or the landlord's online reviews. However, once I moved in, one of the first red flags was the amount of dust and grime in the apartment, which I spent the entire first day cleaning. At the time, I thought nothing of it. My roommates mentioned it to the landlord within that first week when they came by to check on everything, and they said it was professionally cleaned before our arrival.  My first instinct was that whatever cleaners came did not do a perfect job, so I ignored the issue at the time.

Within a week of our move-in, we saw rodents in the apartment. Now, Boston has rodents, and that is inevitable. However, the problem isn't with the rodents as much as with how the situation was handled. Initially, my landlord mentioned that there were no rodents and that this wasn't a problem that any of the other tenants were complaining about. It took us several times and several complaints before he finally decided to call an exterminator. When they came, I wasn't at home, so I requested a summary of their service. When he was hesitant to give that information, I knew something was suspicious, so I insisted on seeing it for my peace of mind. Eventually, he caved, and I noticed on the sheet that not only did the exterminator find evidence of rodents in our apartment, but there were multiple entry ways in our room and every apartment in the building. It also mentioned that every tenant complained about rodents. When the exterminators did come to place traps, within a week, there were several dead mice where the traps were. They had to come back again to seal all the holes. But there was one hole that they could not seal permanently because of the entryway's orientation. They told the landlords they would need to hire contractors to seal it permanently. However, the landlords never followed up with this.

All of this happened within the first 1-2 months of our lease. A few months later, the washing machine in the building would not drain properly. When we informed our landlords, they said nothing was wrong with it and continued business as usual. We weren't able to do our laundry as a result, and it took several complaints before they finally acknowledged that it was truly a problem and replaced it.

We also had flooding in our apartment's kitchen. When we learned about it, it was a problem that originated in the first-floor unit (we are on the second floor), and they had the worst of the flooding. However, my landlords were quick to say whether it was our fault that the flooding happened and asked if we had been dumping food into the garbage disposal. My response to this was that no person in the unit disposes of food in the unit, except for maybe a few grains of rice or leftover coffee grounds that leaked out from the paper coffee filter. Additionally, I regularly clean the sink to prevent food from accidentally draining, and I run the disposal regularly. Eventually, they let go of the idea that the flooding was something we were responsible for.

Most recently, rodents have again been found in the apartment. It has been almost 2 months since they were sighted again, and this time, when we informed them of the situation, they were a bit short with us and told us that it was because we leave our apartment dirty and don't take out our recycling. When we initially saw rodents when we moved in, they also said the same thing. However, it made little sense at the time, as we had just moved in and had brought very few belongings (the apartment was pre-furnished). Even now, my roommates and I clean the apartment weekly, and for recycling, we use paper bags, boxes, or clean plastic bottles that have been rinsed with soap and water before disposal. Laundry is done regularly (and I don't think any of us have such soiled clothes that would attract rodents to begin with), and we do not leave food out or on the floor (which they implied we did). What made the matter worse for me was that when my roommates called to address this situation, one of the landlords yelled at her on the phone. The next day, he came over to apologize for his ""nasty behavior"" (his words, btw).

To make matters more interesting, they were doing unit tours for the last several months since we informed them that we would not be renewing our lease. Since we started seeing rodents again, we left out mouse traps. But before the tours, the landlords requested that we hide the mouse traps when they brought prospective tenants over. When we didn't (because we wanted mice to be caught while we were out, just in case), they removed them and did not put them back after the tours ended. I also had the chance to listen to what they were saying during these tours, and they mentioned there was a closet with storage (it doesn't have storage - it is where the HVAC is).

There have been plenty of other minor problems that appeared during the year that follow the same pattern:

1. We inform them that it is a problem.
2. They tell us there should be no problems.
3. The problem persists, and then they eventually come to look at it after several complaints.
4. He spends half an hour to one hour ""inspecting it"" by himself.
5. He calls us over afterwards to show us that there isn't a problem (and for some reason, there no longer is after he spent an hour ""inspecting"" it) and that we were making a big deal over nothing.

I want to emphasize that I do not mind that these problems happened. Buildings, especially older ones, will have problems. My issue is with how our landlords seemingly dismissed our concerns until the problem could no longer be ignored, or how they constantly gaslit us into thinking that these were not problems to begin with. There is also a lack of transparency in how they address these problems.

I'd like to ask this online community to let me know what you think. If this is truly the fault of my roommates and me, then I will take the necessary steps to be accountable for any wrongdoing on my part. However, if it's the opposite and my landlord is in the wrong, I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation, especially from people who have lived or currently live in Boston. Thank you all, and please be kind in the comments (I tried to be as respectful as I could in my post).",1,1755096102.0,Tenant,1,1.0,False
1mp6c0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/pearljam/comments/1mp6c0x/when_you_i_met_the_guys/,When You & I Met the Guys,"Curious about your stories when you met one or more of the guys in Pearl Jam. I grew up in Seattle proper in the golden era. Met everybody in the band at various times around town except EV. I used to live 2 blocks from Studio Litho in Fremont, so I'd see Jeff at the local coffee shop in the evening. He'd be alone, usually paging through The Stranger.

I met Mike at Cellophane Square (RIP) on the Ave in '93 and he signed an autograph for me which I still have (""Don't let Roosevelt get ya down!"" -- the HS we both went to). I was literally holding the Jeremy single in my hand to purchase, and would hear Yellow Ledbetter for the first time that night when I got home to play it. That was a day. Imagine my 15 year old self--meeting Mike and hearing that one for the first time ever on the same day--I shudder to think.

I spent a lot of the pandemic at a local park with my kid and Stone and his kid. Our kids are the same age, so we would just chat about parenting 2-3x a week for several months at the swings or the sandbox in Seattle (we lived about 6 blocks from each other; Stone invited us to his Halloween party; he dressed as Scooby Doo that year). Those were the best mornings of my life as a new dad (our kids were toddlers--and my son was totally in love with his daughter lol). Stone is just a gem of a human being and we'd talk about Jeff's skateboarding nonprofit and the first shows PJ played after pandemic restrictions lifted. I'll never forget the day I ran into him and he and his daughter were listening to the Pixies on his portable speaker and having a snack and I thought: kid, you have the coolest effing dad in the world!

I met Matt a few times while he was still in Soundgarden. (Also met Kim at an M's game; and met Chris at one of his brother and sister's shows at the Owl & Thistle--Chris was always alone there, and I remember thinking, wow, I'm in the presence of a god--RIP Chris). 

Anyways, I remember a story about a HS girl back in 92 or so that ran into EV at Denny's in Ballard. Her dad had just died. The girl's friend went over to EV and told her and he invited her out to his car and gave her some PJ stuff--vinyl, I think--out of his trunk and gave her a hug. It might be apocryphal, I don't know, but 30+ years later, I still believe it. It was told to me by a friend of a friend. 

And after all that, I've never met EV. Not sure I'd even be able to muster a hello. That guy saved my life (shout out to all you with the ""I'm Still Alive...."" signs at the shows) so many times after roughhhhh high school years.

I think they're the best band in the world, but also the best people, too. Wow, this got long.

1mp6b1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1mp6b1a/telling_mil_about_pregnancy_or_not/,"Telling MIL about pregnancy, or not.","I have not seen my MIL since February/April. Reference ""Another Visit From Hell <3""

MIL is on her same bullshit, treating DH like her boyfriend. Recently, we traveled to our home state (where she moved away from to be closer to DH), she told us/him about a year ago when we go to home state to let her know so that she can come too, we went over how disrespectful (bc she takes time away from them) that is to family that doesn't live 45 min away from us, they live 7hrs and don't see us that often. She thought it wasn't disrespectful, ok. 

When we went this time we didn't tell her, and usually DH will tell her eventually in passing which I think is fine? There's no reason to text your mother when you're 30 years old to say ""Hey I am going to see my dad"" but if they were to chat otp and she asks ""What are you up to?"" and then the answer is ""Oh just in home state visiting my dad"". Which this didn't get to happen because my dad posted a picture of our dog on his FB saying how he was excited she was visiting, we didn't think anything of it until MIL sent DH a text:

""I hope you are back home safe and well. Thank you so much for treating me this way and showing me how much you care and appreciate your fking mom. I guess this is what happens when you give someone your heart and soul. I don't recognize you anymore.""

I personally thought the above was because he said he was going to call her and didn't, which he does to everyone in his life, so he said ""Sorry I didn't call when I said I was going to"" and then he added something about her being manipulative in her texts and to stop guilt tripping him and she said:

""It's not about if you called me when you said you would, it's about you traveling and you know how much I worry. Those texts aren't guilt tripping or manipulative, but you if you think so that's not my fault. I don't recognize you anymore, maybe it's just me thinking so highly of you and having illusions of you. It's ok I will somehow deal with it"" DH didn't respond

Fast forward, I am currently 9 weeks pregnant. We told my parents, my FIL and step MIL and we have been going back and forth on how to tell MIL. DH went to see her this past Sunday and before he went up we were talking about telling her and what that would look like. I told him the thing I am having a hard time with telling her is that she is going to pretend she gives a fk about me now and I am not going to oblige. I was trying to explain to him the time to have a relationship with ME was two years ago when we got married but instead she picked to reprimand me at every visit she has ever seen me at.. . He told me he didn't understand why I am like this and if she were to try to have a relationship with me why wouldn't I be open to it. I tried to explain it any other way I could but felt like I was hitting a brick wall every time trying to explain my thought process to him. Her ""caring"" about me would be FAKE.. I just wasn't sure how that wasn't making any sense.

He said ""Well what if I don't tell her and she tries before we tell her we're pregnant"" we're telling friends around 14 weeks, so how tf would she try in 5 weeks if she hasn't tried in 2 years?? I kept telling him that I am sure this is hard, you are stuck in the middle and you feel like this has to be ""fixed"" but I have tried multiple times on my end to get coffee with her, lunch, a walk in the park and she always said no... so I was confused on what she wanted from me. The last time I saw her, we had this same conversation and she said I don't put effort into her, I turned to my DH and said ""In your eyes, what does a relationship look like with me and your mom?"" and he said ""The way you are with my dad and step mom"" and then he explained to his mom how my relationship with them is, I call them on my own, I text with them in a group chat and on the side etc. Her response was ""That's weird, I don't want that"" A separate time, I tried to get lunch with her and she said ""I don't want to because what would we even talk about"" and she's totally valid to have her opinion but then WTF DO YOU WANT FROM ME??? YOU WANT ME TO LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY?? IDGAF IM EXHAUSTED. 

I am totally fine with her not having a relationship with me, I know it hurts DH because it's his mom. I just want her to be honest, she does not care about me (WHICH IS FINE) but I am exhausted with the ""you don't even try"" and then I try and then she says I didn't and then she says she texts me all the time and I don't respond (which is true now but wasn't when she said this). That being said, I don't want her being a fake ass and calling me all the time bc I am pregnant, she is a stranger to me.

I tried to tell DH that I know he wants to fix this but it's been two years and I am exhausted, and MIL says all the time ""Idk what I did to OP"" which she said this visit AGAIN and DH had a list and got it out and MIL said ""Well I have a list of what OP has done to ME"" and DH said ""Great email it to me"" .... no email has been sent. I was trying to tell DH that I know he wants to fix it and have a perfect world where we all get along, but we have to be realistic... she tells us all the time she isn't going to change and she isn't the problem and he should be prepared for this to be the ""normal"". At the most recent visit, he told her to stop texting him like he's her boyfriend and she's too demanding emotionally. She cried and said there's nothing wrong with the way she texts him and eventually told him she would work on it... she then the NEXT DAY had a flight and said to him ""I love you and miss you so much already"" ok

He didn't end up telling her and said he was just going to send her a text of the sonogram on Monday, but didn't do that. I didn't ask why he didn't because maybe he forgot and honestly I didn't want to remind him.",6,1755096012.0,JUSTNOMIL,10,0.75,False

But last month, something changed my entire perspective.

I was having coffee with Karly, a fellow remote worker.

‚û°Ô∏è I couldn't help but notice how she sat perfectly straight while I was constantly shifting in my chair, trying to find a comfortable position.

When I asked her about it, she laughed and said. 

‚ÄúOh, I used to be exactly like you. 
Constant lower back pain, especially after long coding sessions. I thought it was just what happens when you work from home.""

Then she told me about the 20-20-20 Back Relief Method she discovered.

Here's what it is: ‚§µÔ∏è

Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to do 20 gentle back movements.

Sounds simple, right? 
But here's the thing most people miss...

It's not just about the breaks. It's about the specific movements that target the exact muscles that tighten up from sitting.

Karly showed me 3 key movements: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ The seated spinal twist.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The shoulder blade squeeze
3Ô∏è‚É£ The hip flexor stretch.

The magic happens because you're interrupting the pain cycle before it builds up, instead of trying to fix it after 8 hours of damage.

Within just one week of following this method, my afternoon back pain disappeared completely.

Now I can work my full 8 hour days without that nagging ache that used to make me dread long projects.

‚û°Ô∏è The best part? 

My productivity actually increased because I wasn't constantly distracted by discomfort.

If you're a remote worker dealing with back pain, try setting a 20-minute timer right now and commit to this method for just one week.

Your back will thank you, and you might be surprised how much better you feel overall.

What's your biggest challenge with staying comfortable during long work sessions?

# Background

I‚Äôm an American woman living in South Korea for a year to teach English. I was diagnosed with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) at 26 while living abroad. Still overseas, I moved to a new country at 29 in 2020.

I first considered freezing my eggs in 2021 after a friend did it in the U.S. I hadn‚Äôt met a partner yet, and she recommended it. Unfortunately, my health declined significantly that year. I began feeling extremely fatigued and had cognitive issues. By fall 2021, I experienced severe medical problems: nocturnal hypoglycemia, sustained high blood sugars (A1C 14+ for two years), a hemorrhagic cyst, two fibroids, and extreme fatigue. My doctors were worried about the effects of chronic high blood sugar.

I needed to return to the U.S. in 2022 with the goal of freezing my eggs to preserve fertility, as my health issues increased my infertility risk. Potential diagnoses included MS, pancreatic cancer, and other autoimmune conditions.

# Initial U.S. Consultation

Once back in the U.S., I focused on managing my diabetes using an insulin pump. I reduced my A1C from 12.5 to 8.5, still too high to start egg freezing.

I consulted Shady Grove Fertility (DC) in Nov 2023 at age 32. My baseline numbers were low for my age:

* **Estrogen:** 19 pg/ml
* **LH:** 5.42 mIU/ml
* **FSH:** 8.61
* **AFC:** 8
* **AMH:** 1.76 ng/ml

Despite the progress with my blood sugar, the doctor wanted me to wait at least a year of good control (A1C < 6.5). I was devastated.

# Improving My Health

In Dec 2023, I met with an internal medicine specialist at Atlantis Medical Center (Bethesda). He ran tests my GP and endocrinologist had missed. Results:

* Iron deficiency (low saturation)
* Free testosterone deficiency
* Vitamin D deficiency
* DHEA deficiency
* Magnesium deficiency

In Jan 2024, I quit alcohol and started: DHEA, magnesium, Perfect Amino protein, Calocurb, Garden of Life protein meal replacements, iron, B12 (pills + injections), calcium, Ozempic (for diabetes), vitamin D, testosterone gel. I paired this with a low-carb, high-vegetable diet.

# Move to South Korea

In March 2024, I moved to Korea to teach English, reducing my work hours from 9‚Äì6 to something lighter. This allowed me to focus on diet and exercise. My plan was to improve my health for a year, then do egg retrieval in Spain (quoted ‚Ç¨4,500 / \~$5,294 USD, cheaper than DC).

By March 2025, I realized Korea‚Äôs fertility care was advanced, affordable, and close by‚Äîonly 10 minutes from my apartment. With national health insurance, I was quoted 3.5‚Äì4.5 million won ($2,553‚Äì$3,282 USD, including 5 years of freezing). In DC, I was quoted \~$8,500 USD plus $3,500 for medication and yearly storage fees.

# Health Gains Before Retrieval

I‚Äôve always been fit (BMI \~22‚Äì23.5), but in Korea I healed from a herniated disc, began weightlifting, and increased fresh food intake. My A1C dropped to 6.8, at one point 6.4.

# Challenges of Egg Freezing in Korea

* Cannot donate eggs
* Eggs only stored until age 55
* Must be married to use eggs
* Eggs cannot be shipped‚Äîonly embryos can
* Must return to Korea for transfer
* Less personalized care; short doctor visits
* Doctors do not share follicle size or hormone levels

# First Attempt ‚Äì Canceled

First hospital visit: March 12  
Period: March 26 ‚Üí Clinic on March 27

My AFC had improved to 20 follicles. Unfortunately, the cycle was canceled a week before retrieval because I needed a **non-marriage certificate** from the embassy. The earliest appointment was 10 days after surgery. I stopped meds rather than risk wasting the cycle without proper documents.

By June, my AFC dropped to 8 and 13 follicles. I was heartbroken, especially knowing my lifestyle slipped during vacation.

# Second Attempt ‚Äì July 2025

Despite lower follicle counts, I decided to proceed. By this point, I had 3.5 months of CoQ10, prenatal vitamins, no coffee, good blood sugar, no testosterone, and a better diet.

**Supplements/Injections:**

* Glutathione & B6 booster shots
* B12, iron, magnesium, omega-3, prenatal vitamins, CoQ10, glucomannan, vitamin D, Perfect Amino protein

**Protocol:**

Protocol: 

In March, we used Gonal 225 every day. I stopped before using the IVF-M HP¬†

Another pen of Purgeon was 262,600 Won

**7/12**

Meeting before Retrieval scheduled for October 15 

IVF-M HP 300IU ¬†July 12Provera July 12-15 

I messed up. I forgot to take my trigger shot on July 13. So we had to push Egg retrieval to 7/16. I had no excuse. Brain fog and being distracted. The medication was listed on a different page than normal, and it slipped my mind didn‚Äôt register. It was completely different, my fault. 

**7/14 Trigger Day** 

7/14 I was given 200mg Celebrex to prevent Ovulation until July 15 

Provera 10 mg until July 15

Ovridel (Half) and Lorelin .4CC at 8:15 pm 

**7/15**

No food after midnight. 

**7/16 Retrieval**

Went smoothly. I needed a friend to escort me home. I felt well enough to walk 

Retrieved 38, 33 Mature

Prescribed Ganilever 7/16-7/20

Femara 2.5 mg 7/16-7/22

**Results/ Recovery**

* 38 retrieved, 33 initially mature, 36 mature and frozen

I was at high risk for OHSS and Torsion. Prescribed Ganilever and Femara post-retrieval I was forbid for working out. It took me 9 days for me to get my period. I was prescribed Ganileve right away.  I felt okay enough to walk. I was able to get 10,000 steps throughout the procedure. I did feel pretty bloated. There were some very uncomfortable days, but I was okay afterward.

Reflections

I‚Äôm thrilled with the results, especially given the \~$3,000 USD cost. But this process was grueling. Even if I hadn‚Äôt gotten many eggs, I‚Äôm not sure I could do it again‚Äîespecially alone.

At times, I felt the process was punishment for being single and prioritizing career/travel over relationships. Seeing couples at the clinic was emotionally hard. I kept a notebook to challenge negative thoughts, which helped.

I‚Äôm grateful to have 33 eggs frozen, but the journey left me feeling both relieved and fragile.",5,1755095908.0,eggfreezing,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone, so I'm lowkey still sitting here in my pajamas trying to believe this happened.

Was today some kind of glitch in the simulation? Because there‚Äôs no way I woke up broke and finished the day with an extra $100... just by *tapping* my screen???

Let me break this down, because I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre skeptical. I WAS TOO. Here‚Äôs exactly what went down:

- **Accidentally** (or maybe fate?) stumbled onto this site: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Thought ‚Äúyeah okay, here comes another ‚Äòget paid only after 3 years and 200 surveys‚Äô situation‚Äù but I was BORED, so I tried it.
- Literally just followed the instructions, picked an app, downloaded it, gave my feedback, posted screenshots.
- I KEPT GOING. The payout was clear, fast, and didn‚Äôt require a PhD.
- Checked my account‚Äî***cash straight up in there***. No running to the bank. No waiting. NO JOKE.

If you told me last week this was possible, I‚Äôd have sent you the classic ‚Äúyeah, right dude‚Äù meme.

What hit DIFFERENT here was:

- The payouts are INSTANT. I actually got paid within an hour of completing my first *testing* assignment.
- The steps are idiot-proof. Click. Install. Review. DONE.
- Some apps were kinda fun. Not gonna lie, I lost 20 minutes scrolling.

Using **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** didn't suck the soul from my body like those ‚Äúwatch endless ads for $0.03‚Äù apps.

Here‚Äôs a quick run-through anyone even a little sleep-deprived can follow:

1. Head to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (yes, THAT link. It can‚Äôt be missed).
2. Register. (Takes less than 47 seconds‚ÄîI literally timed it.)
3. Choose an app to test (there are so many categories!).
4. Try it for the required time (seriously, you can get up to grab coffee in the middle).
5. Drop your feedback & upload the proof.
6. Wait for their check. It HITS DIFFERENT.

I swore it was a scam until the second payout rolled in. That‚Äôs when I started texting friends like, ‚ÄúDid I just discover a cheat code?‚Äù

If you‚Äôre broke, procrastinating, or just *hungry* for some extra cash, try this. I'm not even being dramatic.

If this works for you, I DARE YOU to reply here with screenshots‚Äîlet‚Äôs see who racks up the most in a day. Or am I just super lucky? If somebody gets $200, please come back and roast me üòÜ

No shady crypto. No subscription. Just you, your phone (possibly your dog to keep you company), and **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

I'm new to brewing coffee as a hobby and I need some advise from someone more experienced, and possibly using the same coffee machine. I use Gaggia Classic and MiiCoffee DF54 grinder.

I'm experimenting with different beans, but when attempting a proper espresso I end up with a sour coffee, ranging from little sour, to shitty sour. As I understand the reason for that is underextraction. I experiment with finer/coarser grinds, yield (usually trying 40g for 16g coffee) and extraction time (trying between 20s up to 50s). I'm trying to narrow down the reasons why I underextract my coffee.

I use some tricks they advise for my machine (to heat it up additionally I turn on the steaming button for 10s right before brewing + I use pre-infusion trick, by slightly opening steaming valve at the beginning of brewing). I don't know what else I should improve. The potential issuses I believe I may have are:
- shitty puck (I guess you can't help me over the comments), or
- too low water temperature. Maybe someone using mods to this machine could advise me what tricks you use to get a higher temperature?

I've read that internet addiction/ internet addiction withdrawal can lead to a psychotic break?

There was a period in my life where I thought someone else would take revenge on me for what I've done, at night I felt real fear

that something bad would happen.

Also today, I was very obsessive, felt negative emotions about something that seemed to be kind of minor.

Last few days I've done a bunch of productive things, but due to social anxiety, it's been stressful.

Oh, and one more thing. I remember when I was a kid, being scared when laying alone in the bed trying to sleep, my heart was pounding really hard, that sensation made me completely convinced that something was under the bed pressing up on my back, though the sensation was my heart beating really hard?

Other times is when I was a kid I was on the ferry with my family. I was really scared that the ferry would sink and couldn't sleep, all the noises I heard made me fearful that the ferry was sinking/would sink.

These examples seem like they are teetering on being psychosis, at the least delusions.

I also strongly believed in some scary stories on the internet about some planet is going to crash into the earth as a kid.

Also, there was a point in time where I was super obsessive about thinking that I have brain damage/ been damaged by radar on a ship I was working on, weird stuff. Since the radar was resetting my hand watch, I was scared that it had also damaged my brain/ eyes by electromagnetic heating.

Kind of out there stuff, but stuff that made me feel scared even if i technically knew it's unlikely? Still it elicited the fear response, as if it is true. A need to be certain about it?

Anyone else with similar experiences that has figured out what's going on for them?",1,1755095682.0,Dissociation,0,1.0,False
1mp65fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencesitter/comments/1mp65fo/thoughts_in_passing/,Thoughts in passing...,"Just some passing thoughts, on a day much like any other. I‚Äôm sitting on my patio, sunk into a cozy couch, sipping a maple syrup cappuccino from the coffee machine we treated ourselves to. The house is spotless, peaceful, and exactly how my husband and I imagined it when we built it two years ago. A light breeze moves through the trees in that slow, calming way, and I find myself wondering‚Ä¶

After three years of trying for a baby, three failed IVF cycles, an ectopic pregnancy that began this whole journey, and a chemical pregnancy just a few months back, is it worth all the rushing, the tears, the constant stress? Or could I simply choose to enjoy moments like this every morning like I have these past few months?

I have a relaxed, remote, part-time job that I do only during the school year, and only as much as I want to. My one source of unhappiness is this infertility struggle, but is it really the struggle itself that makes me unhappy, or is it the feeling of not fitting into what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? If half my friends didn‚Äôt have children and didn‚Äôt want them, would I still care about trying again? Would I still sign up for the pain, the expectations, the invasive touches I consent to but never truly want?

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm grateful for my life as it is.. the meditation, the kayaking, the hikes, the ice cream dates with my husband, the quiet of my home. Isn‚Äôt that enough? Why chase something that might never happen? Why stir up sadness and stress when I could just let them go?

This breeze feels so nice right now. Grasshoppers are buzzing softly in the background. Tomorrow I‚Äôm flying to Texas for a friend‚Äôs wedding, just because I can. No second-guessing, no hurdles. We live far away in Canada, but as soon as we got the invite, we said yes without hesitation. I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm relaxed.

Will I regret it one day if I stop trying? Or would I regret having a child who might take away this peace of mind I‚Äôve built?

I‚Äôm not high. Just deeply, peacefully aware of how good my life already is.",5,1755095651.0,Fencesitter,2,1.0,False

1mp60ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1mp60ua/summer_trip_woes/,Summer trip woes,"Currently on an end of summer trip to an indoor water park hotel with my husband and ND eight year old. We went to the same brand of place in a different city a couple of years ago and had a pretty good time but everyone I asked said this place in a different city was hands down better in every way so we went to that one this time. We get here and I'm instantly disappointed because this place is definitely worse than the first one we went to in nearly every way. There is just less for us to do which is the exact opposite of what everyone else thinks and just feels cheaper and less nice. I have no clue why everyone says this one is so much better but it's not.  
    
So I'm incredibly disappointed in the place to begin with. Husband and son are *constantly* bickering and fighting.  I slept awful last night because the bed is horrible and son can't sleep without an audio book playing which is fine when he's in his own room but awful when he's sleeping in the same room next to me. Took me until at least 1 or 2 to fall asleep and then husband woke son up around 5 with a prolonged coughing fit which means we were all up in for the day. Which is super awesome when nothing fun opens until 10am. Son is trying to watch Netflix on the hotel TV but there is an obnoxious delay between using the remote and the TV responding so he keeps getting more and more frustrated. He has his tablet with netflix but refuses to use that. I have a horrible headache from the bed and sleeping like shit but son finds it's hilarious to throw open the curtains and flood the room with searing morning sun every ten minutes.   
      
Thankfully the trip is short and I just have to make it through one more night. Wish me luck getting through the day. I am almost done with an iced coffee the size of my head but I am still dead on my feet.",11,1755095349.0,breakingmom,6,0.87,False

We met through mutual friends and clicked instantly  long walks, late-night talks, surprise coffee drop-offs at work. He‚Äôs sweet, attentive, and makes me laugh until my cheeks hurt.

The problem? No one in his life knows I exist.

He says he‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like broadcasting relationships,‚Äù but he also won‚Äôt introduce me to his friends or family, won‚Äôt post a single picture of us, and avoids going to public places near his neighborhood ‚Äújust in case someone sees us.‚Äù

At first, I thought maybe he‚Äôd been burned before and needed time. But it‚Äôs been almost a year. I‚Äôve told him it hurts that I feel like a secret, especially since my friends and family all know and adore him.

Last week, I finally said, ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt be public about our relationship, I can‚Äôt keep doing this.‚Äù He got upset and accused me of ‚Äúruining something good‚Äù over ‚Äúsocial media validation.‚Äù I told him it‚Äôs not about likes  it‚Äôs about feeling like he‚Äôs proud to be with me.

Since then, he‚Äôs been distant. My friends are split some say I‚Äôm right to want a relationship out in the open, others think I‚Äôm overreacting and should just enjoy what we have privately.

1mp5udq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mp5udq/find_out_if_the_nespresso_creatista_plus_is_the/,Find Out if the Nespresso Creatista Plus is the Perfect Espresso Machine,"The Nespresso Breville Creatista Plus BNE800DBL, Damson Blue recently found its way onto my kitchen counter, and I‚Äôve got plenty to share about using it every day. As someone who values a great cup of coffee, I was intrigued by this espresso machine‚Äôs promise of barista-grade coffee at the touch of a button. After constant testing, scrutinizing every feature, and even sharing it with friends and family, I‚Äôm here to break down my experience.

**Thoughtful Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek, polished stainless steel finish of this espresso machine instantly grabbed my attention. The Damson Blue color adds a touch of elegance that complements modern kitchen aesthetics. With dimensions of 15.47""D x 6.73""W x 12.13""H, it fits snugly on the countertop without demanding too much space. Despite its compact footprint, the solid build ensures durability, while the buttons and TFT LCD display feel intuitive to use. This machine just screams premium. Handling the stainless steel milk jug that comes with it further cemented that impression. The jug isn‚Äôt just visually appealing either; it‚Äôs functional and contributes to the overall caf√©-like vibe.

**User-Friendly Features that Simplify Mornings**  
Upon unboxing, I was slightly intimidated, but I quickly grasped the straightforward setup. The high-resolution TFT LCD display guided me step-by-step through care, settings, and brewing options. Adjusting settings like milk temperature and mixture was seamless and gave me a personalized coffee experience daily. The fully automatic operation mode lets you go from zero to a steaming cup in mere moments. It‚Äôs perfect for pre-coffee zombie-mode mornings. Whether you‚Äôre into espresso or fancy latte macchiatos with perfect froth, everything is idiot-proof to pull off.

**Microfoam Milk Steam Wand: A Game-Changer for Texture Lovers**  
Speaking of lattes, the steam wand deserves its moment of glory. The microfoam milk texturing function truly gets it right. I never knew I could create something resembling latte art, but here I am, proudly frothing my milk to perfection. The steam wand lets you customize the froth level with eight texture options‚Äîseriously, who knew there were so many ways milk could be mixed? I also got a bit carried away making different kinds of coffees for friends one weekend and was surprised how consistently well it worked.

[Check Nespresso Breville Creatista Plus BNE800DBL1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bbzjf41l/)

**Performance Under Pressure**  
Brewing coffee with this machine feels nothing short of a professional caf√© experience. With three coffee volume settings (0.84, 1.35, and 3.72 oz), I could make anything from a quick espresso shot to a larger brew for when I had guests over. The 3-second heat-up time blew me away. I‚Äôm the impatient type, so waiting for machines to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù is always irksome. Couple this with its capability to adjust froth levels and milk temperature, and you get a machine that adapts effortlessly to different preferences.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and premium build, enhancing the kitchen aesthetic.  
- Customizable settings allow you to tweak milk texture, coffee volume, and more.  
- Quick heat-up time makes it perfect for rushed mornings.  
- Microfoam milk texturing adds the caf√©-quality touch to homemade coffee.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited by its reliance on Nespresso capsules, which might not appeal to those who prefer fresh ground beans.  
- The damson blue exterior, while beautiful, might not blend with every kitchen color scheme.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing this machine to contenders like the De‚ÄôLonghi Lattissima Pro or the Jura A1, a few differences stand out. The Jura A1 leans toward simplicity and focuses on pure espresso, but it lacks the versatility of milk-based drink creation. The De‚ÄôLonghi Lattissima Pro, while similarly offering milk froth options, doesn‚Äôt quite achieve the same level of microfoam texture precision. This machine doesn‚Äôt beat Jura's compactness or De‚ÄôLonghi's affordability, but its seamless combination of ease-of-use, personalization, and design firmly places it in the upper echelon.

**Worth Every Penny**  
This is hardly the cheapest coffee machine out there, but it provides exceptional value considering its premium features and build quality. Its ability to consistently reproduce caf√©-style drinks is worth noting if you prioritize quality over cost. Compared to more budget-friendly options, you‚Äôre paying for effortless sophistication here, and it delivers. While some competitors fall short in offering such diverse drink-making capabilities in this price range, this espresso maker shines as a multi-functional appliance rather than just a basic brewer.

This turned out so nice probably my best loaf yet and I started it late at 10 pm, got all my stretch and folds done then let it bulk ferment overnight. I‚Äôve never done bulk ferment overnight in case it overproofed. 

But wow I am speechless! Just so proud of myself!

Probably the most delicious loaf and definitely going into regular rotation!

Recipe from Conley Kipp on tiktok
50 g Dutch processed cocoa
100 g coffee/warm water
500 g flour
350 g water
10 g salt
30 g brown sugar
13 g vanilla extract 

Bloom the cocoa by mixing the coffee together and let sit for 5 minutes then continue with adding remaining ingredients and mix together.

Let sit for 1 hour (it was late I did 40 minutes)

Then 3-4 sets of stretch and folds/coil folds 30-45 minutes apart. (Again it was late so I did 30 minutes)

Let finish bulk fermenting

She added chocolate chips during the last stretch and fold set I added it during pre shaped and more after the bench rest. 

Cold ferment for 8-12 hours or 60-90 minutes at room temperature

She baked hers at: 450 for 30 minutes lid on then 400 for 30-40 minutes lid off 

I did: preheat Dutch oven to 500 then baked lid on 475 for 25 minutes and lid off for 15-20 minutes 

Internal temp 200-205 when done

This was such a wet dough I honestly thought this would fail hard and not come together but once i trusted the process the whole time and remained calm, and once I began shaping the dough it came together and gave me hope. 

So cheers to never giving up and power through on all loaves!

Immediately cut to Doctor Doom. ""Ah ha ha! The world is mine! No one can stop me!""

Sam Wilson: ""We can.""

Doctor Doom: ""Who's 'we'?"" (removes his mask)

One by one, MCU characters appear from various directions, superhero landing from the sky, walking in from off-screen, etc. Forty characters each get a 2-3 minute intro scene like in the beginning of Suicide Squad. Name, powers, as seen in ...

Two hours into this introduction montage, we are introduced to Deadpool, who walks in from off screen. Gigantic letters: ""DEADPOOL."" Rousing music. ""No no no, not Hells Bells. Overdone. Something sexually provocative but also with weapon motifs."" Waggles a Desert Eagle to prove his point. KISS's ""Love Gun"" starts playing. ""Wow, hit the overlap of the Venn Diagram on the first try, kudos."" Slow motion walk in while making full eye contact with Doctor Doom and loading bullet after bullet into one of the clips of his Desert Eagle and slipping the clip in and racking it. Song reaches ""You pull the trigger of my ... Love Gun!"" He then shoots Doctor Doom in the face.

Sam: ""Whoa! Whoa! What the hell!""

Deadpool: ""He had his mask down. Everyone has their mask down. Everyone ALWAYS has their mask off. Doesn't vibranium protect against literally everything? Why's your mask off?""

Shuri: ""I have a cute face."" 

Deadpool: ""Yep, fine ... Listen, TLDR version: getting shot in the face is everyone's Kryptonite."" (pans to a group, who look at each other and shrug) ""Work it out from the context. It is NOT hard.""

Elena, Bucky, others look at each other: ""I mean, we could have done that.""

Deadpool: ""You didn't, though. You. Fucking. Didn't. (gestures with the Desert Eagle on each of those three words, and characters noticeably flinch each time) How many more characters are still out there waiting for their intros?""

Every other character steps in from offscreen, some waving sheepishly, others walking in with their heads down. Deadpool mumbles a couple of their names under his breath, then eventually slows and stops.

Deadpool: ""Ugh. So many. No one saw YOUR movie. (points) Flop. (points) Flop. GO HOME! ALL OF YOU TAKE YOUR GREEN SCREEN GLOVES AND YOUR MO-CAP SUITS AND GO HOME! Job's done, no thanks to you turds. I'm not validating parking, you should have Ubered here. Wait, WAIT. You, you, and you. Shit load of chairs to fold up off screen. No, no, fourth wall's that way, offscreen's THAT way."" (gestures with gun)

Every character puts their head down and starts walking off screen. Ultimate Easter Egg. Major, minor, and bit characters from random movies all in the same shot. No music, diegetic sounds only, metallic clicks and clinks from armor rattling, clicks of boots on pavement, sneezes, coughs, etc.

Deadpool: ""Ridiculous amount of overkill on the casting. Some of you don't even look like you have powers. He's in a quarter-zip and Dockers. What your power set, friendo?""

Avengers Galaga guy: ""I played Galaga for like two seconds in a throwaway gag. But a check's a check."" 

More characters file past.

Deadpool: ""Hang on. You. Hold on a second."" Slowly walks up to de-aged version of Ryan Reynolds in the guise of Hannibal King from Blade: Trinity as the chorus to Heart's ""Alone"" plays. ""You canon?""

Hannibal: ""Technically.""

Deadpool: ""You single?""

Hannibal: ""Technically.""

Deadpool: ""I know a pay-by-the-hour hotel close by that makes a good cup of coffee.""

Hannibal quickly scans Deadpool head to toe and nods. They walk off with their backs to the audience, Deadpool slipping a hand into Hannibal's back pants pocket, Hannibal slipping a hand onto Deadpool's buttock.

Deadpool looks over his shoulder: ""Go home. There's no post-credit scene. You'll thank me later, trust me. Oh, and thanks for all the money."" Heart transition effect closes in on their butts as the main Avengers theme plays.
