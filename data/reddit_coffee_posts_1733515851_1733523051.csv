1h8d4rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1h8d4rx/unhinged_barista_catcalled_me_while_i_was_at_the/,Unhinged Barista Catcalled Me While I Was At The Hospital With My Wife,"Basically what the title says. My wife has been in the hospital for the last few days dealing with some complications from her autoimmune disease. I‚Äôve been staying overnight with her to make sure she‚Äôs okay, staying as comfortable as possible, helping her out of bed, etc. and every morning I go downstairs to the coffee shop in the lobby to grab a drink. This morning started off like any other, same barista as usual, but when I came back to pick up my drink after stepping outside for a moment I saw a different barista at the counter. Nothing crazy, I‚Äôd just never seen him before (my wife and I have had about 5 hospital stays this year so we know the staff fairly well). As I approached the pickup counter, I saw him very obviously eyeing me up. When I went to grab my drink he said, ‚ÄúYou look cute and cozy‚Äù. I was uncomfortable with the comment, but I just dismissively said, ‚ÄúYeah it‚Äôs cold today‚Äù and walked off with my drink. About 30 minutes later I ran back downstairs to grab a food delivery from the front entrance before making my way back through the lobby and past the coffee shop. It was then that the same barista from earlier began yelling across the lobby at me. Initially it was, ‚ÄúHi! Welcome in again!‚Äù I ignored it and kept walking. Then again he yelled, ‚ÄúI said hi welcome in again!‚Äù And again I ignored him, refusing to even look in his direction. This is when he started to grow more aggressive yelling, ‚ÄúHi! Hello! Hi!‚Äù at me. Still wasn‚Äôt giving him the time of day, but that somehow seemed to egg him on even more. He began taunting me and fake crying, saying, ‚ÄúIs it me? Am I the problem? Is it me?‚Äù At this point I was sufficiently creeped the fuck out and hurried into the elevator fearing he might start following me. When I got back up to the room I told my wife and a nurse what had happened and we ended up speaking with the staffing director. They are really on top of any sort of complaints here and immediately pulled him from the coffee shop. They got a written statement from me and have reassured me he won‚Äôt be bothering anyone at the hospital anymore. I‚Äôm relieved in that regard, but I‚Äôm still flabbergasted at the fact that this man thought catcalling someone, in any context, but especially at a HOSPITAL was even slightly appropriate.",2,1733522836.0,mildlyinfuriating,0,1.0,False
1h8d4rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1h8d4rr/adverse_magnesium_reaction_rage_on_steroids/,Adverse magnesium reaction: rage on steroids,"I started taking magnesium last June. 400 mg mag oxide -- Nature's Bounty, or whatever. I heard ""shit brand - oxide is terrible,"" but I stuck with it because it worked AMAZING for me. Helped with sleep and heart rate within two weeks & I'm guessing just worked with the other supplements I was taking at the time.

I finished the whole bottle, but I fell off my routine for about four months. I've felt miserable again & trying to get back into the swing of things.

So this time I bought Now Foods 400 mg - oxide, citrate, & aspartate.

I KNOW it's the magnesium bc I usually take it separate from my multi (same one I took in the past) & it's within a couple hours of taking it. It is like the feeling you'd get from 10 cups of coffee on steroids - intense rage! Feel so amped up. It's happened 3x and I had plans but not risking leaving my house bc I'll rip someone's head off!

Really disappointed as it's the first time I've had such an intense reaction to a supp. I'd like to switch back to the oxide, but I don't want to waste my money if I'm having some kind of issue here. 

Has anyone had a similar experience?

I've heard b deficiencies don't play well with magnesium at times, so I considered taking my multi for a month & then trying to reintroduce it?

Also, I have vitamin d deficiency but had the same last year. I wasn't technically deficient in b-12. But recently I was told I have iron insufficiency, so I have been taking iron 3x a week & tolerating it well.

1h8cyhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h8cyhf/avoidant_ex_debating_breaking_nc_in_a_fee_weeks/,Avoidant Ex debating breaking NC in a fee weeks‚Ä¶.,"Sorry for the essay in advance and extensive detail. I just have not been at a loss for words like this ..... I just feel like I am questioning reality. I used to think I could read people so well till I met my first dismissive avoidant. 

So my avoidant ex (30) broke up with me (29) 2 weeks ago today. We talked for 1 month, dated for 3 and it was by far the most meaningful relationship despite the shortest time I've been with someone. I think my first experience with true love, not just saying it but meaning it. 

 A little background: She is a manufacturing business owner who is starting her first huge order and has few very close friends working for her, so she literally has people depending on her success. I know she has constant stress and is always thinking about work, even when waking up. I made it clear that I would never get in the way of her work and I understood that came first for her! 

Normally I have my walls up and am a very closed person. It takes a lot for people to gain my trust and loyalty as once I give it up I'd take a bullet for that person. I wasn't looking for love or a soulmate or another just going with the flow as that is usually how I operate. We went through the classic avoidant honeymoon phase where everything was perfect, intimacy, connection, communication, effort and a perfect relationship in my eyes for lack of better terms. Her roommate would even say ""who are you? I don't even know who this is making all this time for this boy"". I have never moved this fast, but things took off and we were officially bf/gf after a month of seeing each other. Now I am not sure if this was a mask or her true self unburdened by her attachment style (dismissive avoidant) but we were inseparable. She forced me after numerous occasions for me to take her spare key, we took a trip together for her 30th bday/met my friends at a house I hate rented prior to meeting her. Flew out to meet her parents, grandparents/family. One thing that came up on this trip that really eats at me is that I promised her dad to ""take care of her girl"".  I truly meant my affirmation, really thought I had found the one. Looking back now it confuses me because it was a big step having me meet her family for her as an avoidant who fears deep connection.

We then got into our trip to visit her family, which wasn‚Äôt good. A lotta things boiled over and came out. Looking back at it, it  was me realizing her avoidant tendencies and didn't know how to handle them. Seeing the one sidedness and how she had no room for compromise/dismiss things like they were nothing.

We took a week of NC, and didn't officially break up. After a week we spoke together she was very uneasy and kept asking for the key projecting things like ""I know you don't think we are meant for eachother too."" I stressed that she was a priority in my life and that I was willing to make the necessary changes and make it work because I saw how good we were together. She was hesitant and adamant that it takes a lot of time to change as a person. She had said she had done a ton of work on herself in the past. (should have let her go looking back), but I pushed to keep trying and working together through communication. I think she was aware of her attachment style but was struggling to explain. I promised I would never ever put her through that again and that it pained me that I hurt her like that. After we grabbed a glass of wine caught up as normal and cuddled for a little back at my place before she walked home (lives 10 minute walk away)

We eventually resolved the issue or so I thought‚Ä¶. Things were different after the fight, I felt it immediately. 20/20 hindsight she couldn't fully forgive me for the fight as she confided in me that she had only seen her parents fight like that (assuming the source of some of her trauma). I played things slowly and didn't want to pressure her into anything, if she canceled on me or made little effort to see each other I was patient and understanding. Close to a month passed after the reconciliation. We spent a great weekend together, went out together Friday for drinks with friends, spent most the weekend together watching movies, taking walks, and posting IG stories. Things felt back to normal......

Come Monday I give her a call after work just to discuss her week and see if we can make soft plans. Does not pick up and texts me she was busy and needed some time to finish up work. Ended up passing out and not chatting, no worries. Tuesday comes and I ask her to grab dinner, maybe since it was her first day of production (huge milestone). Don't hear back from her till I'm commuting home, she texts me that she forgot she had made prior commitments in the morning to play volleyball, and proposed that we make dinner tomorrow. I responded ""have fun"" as I was starting to get quite annoyed by her dismissiveness. She then doubled down and questioned her initial text about dinner the following day. I called her on the way home and vented a bit of how I was upset and just a little bit of communication would have gone a long way, as I felt a lack of respect for my time, which I am big on and discussed with her after we took a break. Obviously this was the wrong way to handle an avoidant but at the time I had no idea of this attachment style and was focusing on working through an issue rather than let it build up. The conversation was very awkward as I did call her out on some things, I was super sincere, maybe had a bit of a tone. She would follow up with a cold apology followed by weird silences, like she had her tongue tied. I apologized for getting upset and thanked her for taking the time to speak with me, and wished her good luck and fun during volleyball. After that she texted me later she was sorry and would try better (didn't feel one ounce of sincerity, just trying to brush it off). Responded with something nice that I understood and that she wasn't doing it on purpose.

Wednesday I gave her space and heard back from her late that she was going to not disturb me to finish work (thought she would want to make it up to me by having dinner like she had asked not realizing the avoidant thought process). Texted her all good and that I would like to talk over the phone when she had time. (big mistake because I was still upset). Started chatting like nothing was wrong, but I couldn't hold the facade and explained I was still upset. We talked through it with her continual cold demeanor, and she said she would do dinner Thursday (knowing full well I was blowing off my parents and picking them up at the airport). 

Thursday comes around. I sent her some cute dog instagram and she responded ""this is precious"". Everything seems perfectly fine as normal, until it starts getting late around 5. Texted her saying how she was holding up? I was on the verge to text her again saying it was alright if she couldn't make it and would pick up pizza from her fav spot if she was swamped.... Hit me back 2 hours later with a ""hey I know you really wanted to see each other but tonight is not a good night we will talk tomorrow... but that text was my final straw. I called her twice and she didn't pick up. Texted her that if she didn't have the decency to call me back and just explain that we shouldn't be in a relationship (said it out of emotion).

Radio silence as per expected all of Friday till 5-6, she texts me if I wanted to talk, obviously I agreed with some hesitancy albeit. She met me at my apartment, hugged and then proceeded to talk in my car, both visibly upset. Talked around in circles for 30 minutes. She immediately addressed the issues she had about not having enough space, me being understanding and on and on with any excuse she could justify the breakup things that I knew wouldn't even bother her. Saying we weren't on the same page and that she was not in it anymore. I pleaded for one last shot but nothing was getting through, and finally stated that somewhere down the line she had lost respect for me as a person and my time. I ended the convo by saying it didn't work because I truly loved her and would do anything for her but she didn't reciprocate and that she was not the same girl I fell for (not sure tbh). She started to tear up slightly and said she was sorry it didn't work out the way we thought it would and she to had to go. Left a bag with some of my things in my car including the puzzle we were working on (really was the dagger to the heart as we both immensely enjoyed puzzles).

I ended getting drunk and sending a mean text saying she was never in it, and that even when I flew up with her to Michigan that she talking to another dude and to have fun with him (don't think it was the case, she did get a snap or two from some dude but didn't respond). 

Cooled off and remembered that I ordered this pepper shaker during amazon's black week Friday sale...... Really wanted nothing to do with it or remind me of her. Sunday I dropped it off at her apartment, sending her some lighthearted nice text talking about some running joke (told her if it was the last thing id do it was get her a decent pepper grinder) and that I had wanted her to have it for thanksgiving (was hosting her family). Additionally mentioned maybe getting coffee once things calmed down and that I knew she would do great things with her business.
Wasn't expecting even a text back, but she responded a few hours later ""Sorry I have not been trying to be on my phone. This was really thoughtful, I really appreciate it.""  Was quite frankly shocked she even responded. I should have texted her back saying the time apart was good and that I knew where I messed up and I was sorry.... but like an idiot left it read.

After doing a lot of reflecting on attachment styles and talking it out with family members and friends. I think she truly fell for me because I was a secure person who was her comfort/safe space (I took care of her after our first date when she drank too much).  Once we had the fight things started to crumble she went full avoidant and I became anxious over the stress of losing something I held so precious to me, never ever put them on a pedestal!!!!!

I have a lot of things to change about myself, and I am actively working to make the changes to becoming a fully secure person everyday. Let go of things and not let other's I care about actions control my happiness or emotions. I know I messed up and want to change to become a better person, whether its for her or the next person in my life.

The first week was really rough, but I have learned to channel my energy towards productive things that make me happy and align with my goals in life (work, lifting, hanging out with friends) I think the biggest kicker/motivation for me getting over this was that I know her life wasn't stopping so why would mine! All my exes have reached back to me at some point, and I treated her the best by far! I just get this random worry every now and then it will be too late and I will be moved on. 

I feel like an idiot/loser after typing this all out, because I know the best thing is to move on.... unless she actively wants to change.  My hinge has been popping off, and I have two dates with some baddies this weekend. There is just a small piece of me that holds on to that love and wonders if that was truly what we could be like unburdened. I know I still need time to fully heal but I am in a very good place spiritually mentally and emotionally. Nothing is being put on hold in my life for my exe, I hold little to no animosity towards her after really breaking down what transpired. I don't even worry if she is seeing other guys, because I know if we started a strong newfound foundation none of it would matter. I'm a huge believer everything happens for a reason... 

My biggest question, which cant even be answered right now is should I break NC and take a risk to see if there is still a small connection to build a new foundation on (I know this will be a huge commitment and big risk but the best things in life are worth it). Just would love some advice/experiences of people who have been in my shoes. 

I really hope anyone going through the same finds the strength to heal, love and forgive yourself as we are all human and are far from perfect. Time heals all wounds and you will get better, maybe not today or tomorrow but you will and something stronger and better will emerge. 

Much love and best of luck to everyone :)",1,1733522391.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1h8cycy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h8cycy/i_got_played_again_following_confirmation_of_the/,"I got played, again following confirmation of the miscarriage","One month post breakup. Yesterday hit me hard. I got the keys to my new place following his eviction notice from our home we shared together for a year, moving in on Monday (together 18 months). We had a big blow out 2 weeks prior when I told him during an argument that Id been off and moody (we'd been having petty rows about my moods) that I was concerned id had an early miscarriage and had been trying to find ways to tell him, made worse by the petty arguments. We reconciled. Then he broke up with me 2 weeks later out the blue after picking me up from work. His late wife's passing was a week prior. 

I saw my consultant yesterday. Id been dreading the appointment. Wed' reach out a week prior to the split to put forward an application for fertility treatments due to my endometriosis and injury I got during surgery I'm recovering from still 11 months later. I thought I'd burst into tears in the appointment. The consultant agreed with me regarding the suspected miscarriage based on symptoms and test I had that turned positive and faded to negative. It wasn't planned, but we weren't being careful either. I thought I could trust him. Wed discussed previously what would happen if I got pregnant etc had talked a week prior to the split about kids where he said he could see us having them in the future.

I waited weeks to tell him before, and I knew that had contributed to the breakdown of things between us, and he had a right to know. I didn't think we'd get back together and he hadn't been particularly great at managing the breakup so I wasnt considering this. I just wanted to do the right thing. I cried a lot, acknowledged my contribution to things falling apart. He did too. He held me for the first time since the split and I just lay there crying. Cooked me dinner, watched a film with me. Heard me crying late at night in the spare room (my temporary room) and I asked if he could stay with me as I didn't want to be alone. I was surprised to find him still there this morning - but I also knocked myself out with a load of sleeping pills because all I could think about was the miscarriage. 

This morning I asked for a hug and he instead wrapped his arm around me and pulled me in close to him to the point of spooning and held my hand. I quickly realized what was happening. He's accidentally rested his hand on me whilst on the sofa or lay in bed to watch a film since the split, only to put back up the walls/distance by the next day. Said he'd consider taking space and seeing how things go, then abruptly say the next day he doesn't feel that way or see any reconciliation possible in the future. So I jumped up to make a coffee and get on with packing and work. 

When I text him this evening on way to visit friends for the weekend to ask why he been so intimate and close, he said he was comforting me as a friend, no romantic feelings are there and he doesn't see them returning, we're not compatible. I feel like I've been played. I needed that type of comfort weeks ago, not right now. Not when I've accepted I'll be processing the loss and the breakup alone. I preferred being the angry devil woman he needs to keep some safe distance from. It's messed with my head at the worst time. I'm a moron. Anyone else managed to mess up their Friday night in a similar fashion?

to preface this i already know she‚Äôs into girls. i (19f) have been crushing on this girl for the better half of the semester. at first we didn‚Äôt talk at all, and admittedly i was dating around a bit and talking to other ppl, so other than noticing we had multiple classes together i never rlly paid attention to her (first time away from home, wanted to take advantage of the freedom lol). 

a few weeks in i was sitting behind her and she randomly turned around and said hi. she then asked if i‚Äôm in two of her other classes, which i said yes to. we didn‚Äôt continue talking after that but ig the interaction was random enough for me to keep the moment in my head. over time she sorta just became a hallway crush: nothing serious, just something fun to imagine while i was bored in classes. i complimented her clothes every once in a while, but that was the extent of our conversations. 

idk what the sudden flip was, but i started noticing that while waiting in between classes we shared, she would stand very close to me in the hallway. at first she never said anything and would just scroll on her phone, but eventually she‚Äôd start butting into convos i‚Äôd have with mutual friends, which in turn got us talking more. she followed me on insta first. a few days when by and i worked up a minimal amount of courage to like two of the posts she made. not even five minutes after she followed me on her spam account, which pretty much only had ppl from her school following it. after this i figured she liked me well enough to at least consider me friendly so i made an effort to talk to her more. 

in class we were assigned in the same group for a final project so that helped a lot, and it also got me her number. i noticed she started leaning in more while we joked around waiting for class, and that our state would meet more often from across the room, etc. she began striking up convos w me after class too, and i‚Äôd walk with her until the end of the block where we then split ways cuz of different routes.

coming back from break this week, i decided to sit in front of her in class, and we talked abt our group project and a movie we both wanted to see. i texted her later to see if she wanted to come w me and some of my friends to see said movie. at first i thought i was cooked cuz she said she had a lot of hw, but then she actually showed up!

it was kind of awkward hanging out with her outside of school, but comforting in a way too cuz i could tell she was also nervous? her face would get rlly red if i said something remotely flirty, or she‚Äôd stumble on a word and cover her face with her hand. she‚Äôs super funny tho so we mostly just sat around and riffed off each other (admittedly i was not paying attention to my friend group for most of the night üò≠). she sat by me in the theater and our arms/legs kept brushing. we lowkey whisper talked thru the entire thing which i‚Äôm sure was extremely annoying for the ppl behind us (my bad). then i got to walk her home! 

we sat next to each other in class the day after that. then after class we were joking around abt a professor, then we started talking abt what we wanted to do after college, and she intentionally passed her usual turn to keep talking to me. i wanted to ask her out for coffee or something, but i chickened out. our goodbye was a little awkward too. 

anyways this was long and probably stupid, but idk! do y‚Äôall think i have a chance or is she just being friendly.

1h8cw9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProlificAc/comments/1h8cw9k/concerningly_biased_study/,Concerningly Biased Study,"What I am essentially looking for here is to see if this is the sort of thing Prolific cares about. Are these kinds of studies allowed? Should I report them?  
  
This study had hints of odd bias at first. Imagine being asked what kind of coffee you drink during work hours and how much, which is framed as negative. Oddly, classic black coffee (which some workplaces offer) is not present. A mistake? Or bias?  
  
But then came the question that stood out to me:

""If your workplace banned coffee during work hours, how would that affect you?""

A. I would feel more productive.

B. I would feel less lively.

C. I would not be affected.

The participant can only provide an answer that supports a pro-ban message: Coffee makes people less productive; People rely on coffee so much that being without it even for a few hours makes them feel less alive; Or they are not affected so they will not be upset by the ban.

In the original, ""lively"" was ""connected"". Which adds a bit more context as to why these answers are so important in how biased they are, in my opinion.

In answer A, the exact opposite might be true for people who use not-coffee as a productivity aide, like myself and many others I know.

For Answer B, it is a way to dishonestly ""throw a bone"" to people who would be affected while also downplaying the realities of their situation. Is having not-coffee an accessibility issue for you? Well, you just made your voice known as just sort of not liking that you can go on Instagram 24/7.

For Answer C, it is the answer for any who support the ban, because they would not be affected. It is also for those who just don't see the bias, for they also would not be affected.

It is literally designed so that no matter what, at \*worst\* they could say that most people wouldn't be affected by the ban. So quite literally your answer does not matter, because every single answer is, in effect, the same answer.",0,1733522226.0,ProlificAc,3,0.33,False

1h8cozw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1h8cozw/thoughts_on_breaking_nc_down_the_line/,Thoughts on breaking NC down the line,"Sorry for the essay in advance and extensive detail. I just have not been at a loss for words like this ..... I just feel like I am questioning reality. I used to think I could read people so well till I met my first dismissive avoidant. 

So my avoidant ex (30) broke up with me (29) 2 weeks ago today. We talked for 1 month, dated for 3 and it was by far the most meaningful relationship despite the shortest time I've been with someone. I think my first experience with true love, not just saying it but meaning it. 

 A little background: She is a manufacturing business owner who is starting her first huge order and has few very close friends working for her, so she literally has people depending on her success. I know she has constant stress and is always thinking about work, even when waking up. I made it clear that I would never get in the way of her work and I understood that came first for her! 

Normally I have my walls up and am a very closed person. It takes a lot for people to gain my trust and loyalty as once I give it up I'd take a bullet for that person. I wasn't looking for love or a soulmate or another just going with the flow as that is usually how I operate. We went through the classic avoidant honeymoon phase where everything was perfect, intimacy, connection, communication, effort and a perfect relationship in my eyes for lack of better terms. Her roommate would even say ""who are you? I don't even know who this is making all this time for this boy"". I have never moved this fast, but things took off and we were officially bf/gf after a month of seeing each other. Now I am not sure if this was a mask or her true self unburdened by her attachment style (dismissive avoidant) but we were inseparable. She forced me after numerous occasions for me to take her spare key, we took a trip together for her 30th bday/met my friends at a house I hate rented prior to meeting her. Flew out to meet her parents, grandparents/family. One thing that came up on this trip that really eats at me is that I promised her dad to ""take care of her girl"".  I truly meant my affirmation, really thought I had found the one. Looking back now it confuses me because it was a big step having me meet her family for her as an avoidant who fears deep connection.

We then got into our trip to visit her family, which wasn‚Äôt good. A lotta things boiled over and came out. Looking back at it, it  was me realizing her avoidant tendencies and didn't know how to handle them. Seeing the one sidedness and how she had no room for compromise/dismiss things like they were nothing.

We took a week of NC, and didn't officially break up. After a week we spoke together she was very uneasy and kept asking for the key projecting things like ""I know you don't think we are meant for eachother too."" I stressed that she was a priority in my life and that I was willing to make the necessary changes and make it work because I saw how good we were together. She was hesitant and adamant that it takes a lot of time to change as a person. She had said she had done a ton of work on herself in the past. (should have let her go looking back), but I pushed to keep trying and working together through communication. I think she was aware of her attachment style but was struggling to explain. I promised I would never ever put her through that again and that it pained me that I hurt her like that. After we grabbed a glass of wine caught up as normal and cuddled for a little back at my place before she walked home (lives 10 minute walk away)

We eventually resolved the issue or so I thought‚Ä¶. Things were different after the fight, I felt it immediately. 20/20 hindsight she couldn't fully forgive me for the fight as she confided in me that she had only seen her parents fight like that (assuming the source of some of her trauma). I played things slowly and didn't want to pressure her into anything, if she canceled on me or made little effort to see each other I was patient and understanding. Close to a month passed after the reconciliation. We spent a great weekend together, went out together Friday for drinks with friends, spent most the weekend together watching movies, taking walks, and posting IG stories. Things felt back to normal......

Come Monday I give her a call after work just to discuss her week and see if we can make soft plans. Does not pick up and texts me she was busy and needed some time to finish up work. Ended up passing out and not chatting, no worries. Tuesday comes and I ask her to grab dinner, maybe since it was her first day of production (huge milestone). Don't hear back from her till I'm commuting home, she texts me that she forgot she had made prior commitments in the morning to play volleyball, and proposed that we make dinner tomorrow. I responded ""have fun"" as I was starting to get quite annoyed by her dismissiveness. She then doubled down and questioned her initial text about dinner the following day. I called her on the way home and vented a bit of how I was upset and just a little bit of communication would have gone a long way, as I felt a lack of respect for my time, which I am big on and discussed with her after we took a break. Obviously this was the wrong way to handle an avoidant but at the time I had no idea of this attachment style and was focusing on working through an issue rather than let it build up. The conversation was very awkward as I did call her out on some things, I was super sincere, maybe had a bit of a tone. She would follow up with a cold apology followed by weird silences, like she had her tongue tied. I apologized for getting upset and thanked her for taking the time to speak with me, and wished her good luck and fun during volleyball. After that she texted me later she was sorry and would try better (didn't feel one ounce of sincerity, just trying to brush it off). Responded with something nice that I understood and that she wasn't doing it on purpose.

Wednesday I gave her space and heard back from her late that she was going to not disturb me to finish work (thought she would want to make it up to me by having dinner like she had asked not realizing the avoidant thought process). Texted her all good and that I would like to talk over the phone when she had time. (big mistake because I was still upset). Started chatting like nothing was wrong, but I couldn't hold the facade and explained I was still upset. We talked through it with her continual cold demeanor, and she said she would do dinner Thursday (knowing full well I was blowing off my parents and picking them up at the airport). 

Thursday comes around. I sent her some cute dog instagram and she responded ""this is precious"". Everything seems perfectly fine as normal, until it starts getting late around 5. Texted her saying how she was holding up? I was on the verge to text her again saying it was alright if she couldn't make it and would pick up pizza from her fav spot if she was swamped.... Hit me back 2 hours later with a ""hey I know you really wanted to see each other but tonight is not a good night we will talk tomorrow... but that text was my final straw. I called her twice and she didn't pick up. Texted her that if she didn't have the decency to call me back and just explain that we shouldn't be in a relationship (said it out of emotion).

Radio silence as per expected all of Friday till 5-6, she texts me if I wanted to talk, obviously I agreed with some hesitancy albeit. She met me at my apartment, hugged and then proceeded to talk in my car, both visibly upset. Talked around in circles for 30 minutes. She immediately addressed the issues she had about not having enough space, me being understanding and on and on with any excuse she could justify the breakup things that I knew wouldn't even bother her. Saying we weren't on the same page and that she was not in it anymore. I pleaded for one last shot but nothing was getting through, and finally stated that somewhere down the line she had lost respect for me as a person and my time. I ended the convo by saying it didn't work because I truly loved her and would do anything for her but she didn't reciprocate and that she was not the same girl I fell for (not sure tbh). She started to tear up slightly and said she was sorry it didn't work out the way we thought it would and she to had to go. Left a bag with some of my things in my car including the puzzle we were working on (really was the dagger to the heart as we both immensely enjoyed puzzles).

I ended getting drunk and sending a mean text saying she was never in it, and that even when I flew up with her to Michigan that she talking to another dude and to have fun with him (don't think it was the case, she did get a snap or two from some dude but didn't respond). 

Cooled off and remembered that I ordered this pepper shaker during amazon's black week Friday sale...... Really wanted nothing to do with it or remind me of her. Sunday I dropped it off at her apartment, sending her some lighthearted nice text talking about some running joke (told her if it was the last thing id do it was get her a decent pepper grinder) and that I had wanted her to have it for thanksgiving (was hosting her family). Additionally mentioned maybe getting coffee once things calmed down and that I knew she would do great things with her business.
Wasn't expecting even a text back, but she responded a few hours later ""Sorry I have not been trying to be on my phone. This was really thoughtful, I really appreciate it.""  Was quite frankly shocked she even responded. I should have texted her back saying the time apart was good and that I knew where I messed up and I was sorry.... but like an idiot left it read.

After doing a lot of reflecting on attachment styles and talking it out with family members and friends. I think she truly fell for me because I was a secure person who was her comfort/safe space (I took care of her after our first date when she drank too much).  Once we had the fight things started to crumble she went full avoidant and I became anxious over the stress of losing something I held so precious to me, never ever put them on a pedestal!!!!!

I have a lot of things to change about myself, and I am actively working to make the changes to becoming a fully secure person everyday. Let go of things and not let other's I care about actions control my happiness or emotions. I know I messed up and want to change to become a better person, whether its for her or the next person in my life.

The first week was really rough, but I have learned to channel my energy towards productive things that make me happy and align with my goals in life (work, lifting, hanging out with friends) I think the biggest kicker/motivation for me getting over this was that I know her life wasn't stopping so why would mine! All my exes have reached back to me at some point, and I treated her the best by far! I just get this random worry every now and then it will be too late and I will be moved on. 

I feel like an idiot/loser after typing this all out, because I know the best thing is to move on.... unless she actively wants to change.  My hinge has been popping off, and I have two dates with some baddies this weekend. There is just a small piece of me that holds on to that love and wonders if that was truly what we could be like unburdened. I know I still need time to fully heal but I am in a very good place spiritually mentally and emotionally. Nothing is being put on hold in my life for my exe, I hold little to no animosity towards her after really breaking down what transpired. I don't even worry if she is seeing other guys, because I know if we started a strong newfound foundation none of it would matter. I'm a huge believer everything happens for a reason... 

My biggest question, which cant even be answered right now is should I break NC and take a risk to see if there is still a small connection to build a new foundation on (I know this will be a huge commitment and big risk but the best things in life are worth it). Just would love some advice/experiences of people who have been in my shoes. 

I really hope anyone going through the same finds the strength to heal, love and forgive yourself as we are all human. Time heals all wounds and you will get better, maybe not today or tomorrow but you will and something stronger and better will emerge. 

I know there is a lotta negative hate against avoidants and though it might not be fair how they discard us or dismiss  they are human too. Life‚Äôs too short and everyone‚Äôs situation is 100% different.

Much love and best of luck to everyone :)",1,1733521691.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

I (29F) got coffee with my friend Angel (29F). She ordered a mocha, but received a matcha by accident (I‚Äôm surprised this doesn‚Äôt happen more often I didn‚Äôt realize how similar they sound). While they were remaking her drink, they offered her the matcha and she said oh gross no matcha is disgusting and I can‚Äôt believe people would choose to drink something that tastes like grass and then threw in the body move to signal yuck (finger point to mouth, tongue out, gagging). I was embarrassed by her reaction which is very odd because Angel is very active in being politically correct and I‚Äôm not so much (always publicly reprimands me for trying my dam-nest to use the updated word for unhoused/ unsheltered/ individuals experiencing homelessness, but I guess I‚Äôm always 1 word behind). So then the first stupid thought that came to me was that she‚Äôs totally pranking me and I laughed and said ‚Äúoh my you had me there I was like this is a strong reaction to some matcha‚Äù and I freaking laughed. 

She responded that this was not a joke and that matcha is ‚Äúfucking nasty‚Äù. Shocked by her reaction, I just said I love matcha (they make it sweet here so that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt take it) and I know it‚Äôs not for everyone, but I feel awkward that you‚Äôre making it seem like it‚Äôs uncivilized to drink it. I feel like you‚Äôre yucking my yum. She then said that I was calling her a racist and the barista and I made eye contact and it took me a minute to respond because I wasn‚Äôt calling her a racist but once she said that I did feel like maybe her reaction did have notes of it I guess, but it doesn‚Äôt adequately sum up  how I felt about the situation. I‚Äôm also white and not sure if that constitutes as racism? 

It took me a minute to response, I couldn‚Äôt even find words I was so confused  and so she just left and immediately told our friend group about it and everyone is saying I‚Äôm the asshole.

I recently got my hands on the BenQ X3100i, a 4K gaming projector that's been making waves in the gaming community. As someone who loves both gaming and home theater setups, I was eager to see if it lived up to the hype.

The X3100i packs a punch with its 4K resolution and 3300 ANSI lumens brightness. I was impressed by how crisp and vivid the images looked, even in a well-lit room. The 4.2ms response time at 1080p 240Hz is a game-changer for fast-paced titles, making my gaming sessions feel smooth and responsive.

https://preview.redd.it/u0eeodkota5e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df2e4262d8396eeea6017da4beae1f9e7ade1554

One thing I really liked was the built-in Android TV. It made streaming content a breeze, and I didn't need to connect any extra devices. The 10W TreVolo speakers with Dolby Atmos output were a nice touch, filling my room with good sound.

Setting up the X3100i was pretty easy thanks to its auto keystone and vertical lens shift features. I could adjust the image to fit my screen perfectly without much fuss.

While the picture quality is great for most games and movies, I noticed the contrast could be better in some darker scenes. Also, a few users have reported issues with HDR switching when gaming on certain consoles.

# Bottom Line

The BenQ X3100i is a solid choice for gamers who want a big-screen experience. Its low input lag and bright 4K picture make it stand out from the crowd.



# Overview of the BenQ X3100i True 4K Gaming Projector

I recently got my hands on the BenQ X3100i and put it through its paces. This gaming projector packs a punch with true 4K resolution and HDR support. I was impressed by its bright 3300 ANSI lumens output, which made games pop even in my well-lit room. The 4.2ms response time at 1080p 240Hz is great for fast-paced games.

The built-in Android TV is a nice touch, letting me easily stream content. I enjoyed the 10W speakers with Dolby Atmos output, though serious gamers may want external audio. The auto keystone and vertical lens shift made setup a breeze.

While the picture quality is stunning, I noticed some rainbow effects typical of single-chip DLP projectors. The contrast could be better in very dark scenes. Still, for most gaming and movie watching, the X3100i delivers an immersive big-screen experience.

# Stunning 4K HDR-Pro Display

The picture quality on this projector blew me away. I was amazed by the crisp 4K resolution and vivid HDR colors. Dark scenes looked deep and rich, while bright areas popped off the screen. The 3300 lumens provided plenty of brightness, even in rooms with some ambient light. I noticed smooth motion during fast-paced games and action movies. The 200-inch max image size let me create a truly immersive home theater experience. While the colors were stunning overall, I found them a bit oversaturated at times. Adjusting the settings helped, but took some tweaking to get just right. The auto keystone worked well to square up the image when I set it at an angle.

# Lag-Free Gameplay at 240Hz

I was blown away by the X3100i's smooth gameplay. At 240Hz, my games felt incredibly responsive. The 4.2ms input lag at 1080p is so low, I couldn't notice any delay between my actions and on-screen movement. Fast-paced shooters and fighting games were a joy to play. The projector kept up with even the most hectic action without any stuttering or screen tearing. I found this high refresh rate really gave me an edge in competitive multiplayer matches. The crisp motion made it easier to track moving targets and react quickly. While 4K resolution is great for visuals, I think the 240Hz mode is the star for serious gamers who want the best performance.

# Flexible Installation Options

I found the X3100i really easy to set up in different spots around my home. The tabletop mount worked great on my coffee table, but I also tried it on a shelf. The vertical lens shift was super handy for fine-tuning the image position without moving the whole projector.

Auto keystone correction made squaring up the picture a breeze. I didn't have to fiddle with manual adjustments. The throw distance is flexible too - I got a clear image from about 8 to 12 feet away from my wall.

The white color blends in nicely with my decor. At 3300 lumens, it's bright enough to use in rooms with some ambient light. The built-in Android TV and speakers mean you can just plug it in and start watching with minimal extra gear.

# Integrated All-In-One Entertainment Hub

I've been really impressed with how this BenQ projector serves as a complete entertainment hub. It comes with Google-certified Android TV built-in, giving me access to tons of streaming apps and content. I can easily cast from my phone or laptop using AirPlay or Chromecast. The projector even has 10W speakers with Dolby Atmos support, though I prefer connecting it to my sound system for more immersive audio. While the built-in features are convenient, I noticed the interface can be a bit sluggish at times. Still, having everything integrated in one device is great for my setup. I don't need to plug in separate streaming boxes or worry about extra wires.

# Immersive Audio with Dolby Atmos Support

I was blown away by the audio quality of this projector. The X3100i has built-in 10W TreVolo speakers that pack a surprising punch. What really takes the sound to the next level is the Dolby Atmos support. I connected the projector to my AV receiver using eARC and was amazed by the immersive 7.1-channel surround sound.

The audio filled my room, making me feel like I was right in the middle of the action while gaming and watching movies. Explosions had depth, dialogue was crisp, and I could hear subtle audio cues all around me. For such a compact device, the audio capabilities are impressive.

While the built-in speakers are good for casual use, I'd still recommend external speakers or a sound system to get the full Dolby Atmos experience. But having the option for both is great.

# Pros and Cons

I've spent a good amount of time testing out the X3100i projector. It's got some great features, but also a few drawbacks. Let's break it down.

# Pros

* Amazing 4K picture quality with HDR
* Super low input lag for gaming (4.2ms at 1080p/240Hz)
* Bright 3300 ANSI lumens output
* Built-in Android TV for streaming
* Flexible setup with lens shift and zoom
* Dolby Atmos audio support

The X3100i really shines when it comes to image quality. Games and movies look stunning in 4K HDR. I was blown away by how crisp and vibrant everything looked on my wall.

For gaming, the low input lag is a game-changer. I felt no delay when playing fast-paced games. The 240Hz refresh rate at 1080p is butter smooth too.

Setup was a breeze thanks to the lens shift and zoom. I could easily adjust the image to fit my screen perfectly.

# Cons

* Rainbow effect visible to some users
* Limited zoom range for smaller screens
* Occasional HDR/SDR switching issues
* Contrast could be better
* Pricey compared to some alternatives

The biggest issue I found was the rainbow effect. While I didn't notice it, some users report seeing color flashes that can be distracting.

If you want a smaller screen size, you might struggle. The zoom range is limited, so you need a good amount of space to get a smaller image.

I also ran into some problems with HDR switching when gaming. The screen would go black for a few seconds, which got annoying fast.

While the picture is bright, the contrast isn't as deep as I'd like. Blacks could be darker for a more cinematic look.

Lastly, it's not cheap. You're paying a premium for the 4K resolution and gaming features.

# Customer Reviews on Performance

I've had the chance to use the X3100i projector, and it's clear that gamers love its performance. Many users praise its low input lag and high refresh rate, perfect for fast-paced games. The 4K picture quality is stunning for both gaming and movies. Some folks mention how bright it is, even in well-lit rooms.

On the downside, a few users noticed a rainbow effect, which can be distracting. There were also some reports of HDR/SDR switching issues with certain game consoles. The contrast isn't the best, but most find it a fair trade-off for the brightness.

Overall, reviews are mixed but lean positive. Gamers seem happiest with the X3100i, while movie watchers have more varied opinions. It's a solid choice for those who prioritize gaming performance in a projector.

# Customer Reviews on Usability

I found the X3100i to be a user-friendly projector with some great features. Many users praise its easy setup process and intuitive menus. The auto keystone and vertical lens shift make positioning a breeze. Gamers love the low input lag and smooth motion for fast-paced titles. The built-in Android TV is convenient, though some wish for more app options. A few folks mention the rainbow effect bothers them, but most don't notice it. The bright 3300 lumen output looks great even with some ambient light. While the contrast could be better, the overall image quality impresses for both gaming and movies. The speakers sound good for casual use, but serious users will want external audio. I appreciate how quietly it runs during operation.

# Conclusion

I've spent a lot of time with the X3100i, and it's left me with mixed feelings. The picture quality and brightness are impressive for gaming and movies. I love how smooth games look at high frame rates. The built-in speakers sound decent too. But there are some downsides. The rainbow effect bothers some people. The HDR switching can be annoying while gaming. And the limited zoom may not work for all rooms. For serious gamers and movie fans who want a big screen experience, this projector has a lot to offer. But it's not perfect for everyone. Think about your specific needs and room setup before buying. Overall, I'm mostly happy with it, but there are a few quirks to be aware of.",1,1733521604.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

The Rocky is doing fine, but I'm reading that it's not a great grinder for the kind of beans we use (mostly medium roast) and also the level of retention is pretty annoying.

I mostly drink lattes, my spouse drinks mostly espresso or americanos. We typically weigh out beans for each drink we make, and I'd prefer to grind into a dosing cup than straight into the portafilter. We usually make 2-3 drinks a day so not super high volume.

My husband also tends to grind a bunch of coffee in one go to take to work and use for aeropress for a few days at a time, so a grinder that could handle that as well would be ideal but if that's out of the question I suppose we could keep the Rocky around for it (or it could move to his office).

My skill level is.... intermediate. I got to pulling decent shots during the pandemic but have slacked lately and am hoping to get back on the horse.

I leaned against the kitchen counter, staring at the coffee mug she painted for me in the third grade. ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Dad‚Äù it said, in shaky, colorful letters. Well, World‚Äôs Best Dad didn‚Äôt raise his daughter to fall for some motorcycle-riding, leather-jacket-wearing rebel named Chase. Who even names their kid Chase? That‚Äôs not a name; that‚Äôs a warning sign!

Images of him flooded my mind‚Äîhis stupid smirk, his hair gelled within an inch of its life, his hands in his ripped jeans pockets like he owns the world. He probably doesn‚Äôt even know how to change a tire. My daughter deserves someone who can change a tire.

I stumbled into the living room and sank into my recliner. The one place that had always brought me peace now felt like a throne of despair. I reached for the remote, but even The Weather Channel couldn‚Äôt drown out the chaos in my mind.

I could hear her upstairs, probably texting him right now. ‚ÄúDaddy doesn‚Äôt get us,‚Äù she‚Äôs probably typing, adding a sad face emoji, because that‚Äôs how kids communicate their deepest emotions these days. I get emojis. I send them. I‚Äôm a cool dad.

But no emoji can express the depths of betrayal I feel right now. My little girl, the one who used to run to me when her Barbie lost a shoe, now defending some guy who probably uses Axe Body Spray and calls me ‚Äúsir‚Äù in that fake respectful way.

I knew this day would come. I‚Äôve seen it in the movies. But I always thought I‚Äôd be ready‚Äîstrong, wise, with a speech about respect and values. Instead, here I am, a broken man in sweatpants, Googling, ‚ÄúWhat to do when your daughter dates a loser.‚Äù

Maybe I‚Äôm being too harsh. Maybe Chase has a redeeming quality or two. I mean, he has nice teeth. And he said, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù when I handed him that root beer last week. But no. This isn‚Äôt about root beer. This is about my baby girl.

I‚Äôll talk to her again tomorrow. I‚Äôll tell her she deserves someone better. Someone who‚Äôll write her love letters, not text her ‚Äúu up?‚Äù at 2 a.m. Someone who‚Äôll bring her flowers, not drive her around on a moped that sounds like a dying lawnmower.

Long story short.. I (M30) and my colleague (F36) have known eachother from work for 2.5 years, of those years 1.5 years we have gotten extremely close.. we have eachothers socials (snapchat/insta/tiktok/fb etc..)

We are in the same department working together everyday for context and over time we have gotten very close.

We would wait for eachother to go on breaks, start/finish/ leave together. We went on a group road trip multiple times (group of 3), even went on a few just the 2 of us.. we shared secrets..went for coffee ...food...shopping.. .cinema together... just the 2 of us but never told anyone else like a private outing. I would pick her up like any gentleman would and do the driving... sometimes  look after the bill and surprise her with her favourite snack/drink before we set off on the journey.

I know what she likes and dislikes... I know what views she has in life and it's very similar to mine...

Having spent so much time and to willingly make time... would you develop feelings? 

I know I have and I may have let my feelings and all the what ifs get the better of me...

So much that I asked 'Have you ever thought about us being together?' 

Her immediate response was 'We are better as friends'

Deep down I kind of knew the answer but I needed to hear it. I already knew the answer but I just couldn't take living in the 'What ifs'

I just want to say that.. I really like her... more than anyone else I've ever met and she's the person I think of everyday without trying.. and is someone I would like to build a future with..

But right now.. I think she's feeling mad at me.. perhaps a little awkward and now uncomfortable.. but I have not changed how I talk or interact with her i act as if nothing happened.. yes it hurts me on the inside.. badly.. it brought me back to reality... but all I want is for her to be happy

He gets what he needs when he needs it.

The man has no hobbies as he runs a business and works every day of the week for 10-11 hours a day. He doesn't read, doesn't smoke, can't drink due to a pervious stroke(im also under 21 and can't buy that stuff)

I live with him as i am a college student as well as work with him so spending time is already happening.

He is never happy with clothing that is bought for him so thats out of the question. My mom already got him orthopedic shoes as he has flat feet.

He is particular about his coffee and only likes one type of brand and has a $600 coffee maker. so thats a no go.

Events are hard to plan as he needs to run a business and can't go places.

1h8ci4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1h8ci4j/need_some_moral_support_and_advice/,Need some moral support and advice! ,"I commented on someone's post about this recently but the humor of the situation is starting to wear off!  

I (30F) am in my 2nd year of college and am doing really well so far but right now I am in struggle town. I have had the whole semester (I'm in the US) to complete a literary research project and 300 topics for my pre calculus class. I naively thought to myself all semester ""I will be able to do this stuff no worries"" and have left it until the last minute. I was super busy with work until recently which was part of the problem and I knew I would have time off at the end of the semester. Which is where I am now.

My research project is due Wednesday (2000 words) and my maths topics are due next Sunday (the 15th) which is also the day I have to do my pre calculus final. I have a biology final 2 days after that which I have not studied for at all but luckily is not cumulative and I've gotten As/Bs on my other tests and the prof will drop my lowest test grade (it's KILLING my perfectionism to say ""just flunk it"" but I know that might be my only option at this point) 

I've managed to work my way through 140 of the maths topics over the past week and get around 1000 words done for my research paper but I am hitting a wall and starting to feel burnt TF out. I've been getting through 20 maths topics a day but the topics are getting harder and harder, and staying up until 1am ish to write the paper. 

I take 20mg Vyvanse a day but I forgot to take it today so I've been drinking coffee all day. I've been trying to do 20-30 mins yoga every day and today I took my dog for a 20 min walk so I feel like I'm really trying to take care of myself but today I haven't eaten much and I just feel like my eyes are going to fall out of my head from staring at a screen for 8-12 hours a day. 

I know that I CAN do this.... I just have to keep pushing through every day and I'm trying to keep the negative thoughts away but I am starting to unravel a little bit. My perfectionism sucks so bad because I want to get an A on my research project and my partner keeps telling me that I'm doing too much for it (my prof also warned me that I picked a topic that was more than needed for the class but I foolishly thought I could handle it). School was so hard for me as a teenager and I basically failed my way through it, only just passing year 12. Now I have a high GPA and get straight As and it feels so good and I'm so afraid it's going to slip through my fingers before I know it. 

Any tipcs, advice/kind words are welcome üò≠ ",1,1733521181.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1h8chye,https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/1h8chye/trapped_inside_challenge_discussion/,Trapped Inside challenge discussion,"# Intro

I want to start with a shout-out to Glock9 for getting me into this game and this challenge!!

I have tried the trapped inside challenge so many times now that I have lost count. What initially started as an attempt to fly off of the 7 Day Suites, quickly turned into ""Can I even survive past day 10?"" (horde every 5 days). My last attempt made it to the day 10 horde but I got completely overrun and don't really see a path to survival.

# Settings

* **Version:** v1.1 (b-15)
* **Platform:** Console / PS5
* **Mods:** None
* **Map:** Pregen04k1
* **Difficulty:** Adventurer
* **PermaDeath:** On
* **Air Drops:** Disabled
* **Location:** 7 Day Suites
* **Biome:** Snow
* **Horde Frequency:**  5 nights
* **XP Multiplier:** 300%
* **Loot Multiplier:** 200%

# Startup

The POI is about 2km North East of the spawn so I have time to grab the following items on the way there and get inside the garage in the back by around 11:30am on the first day.

**Starting Items**:

* All of the basic items given at the start of the game
* 250 wood
* 50 stone
* 4 tree seeds
* 50 feathers
* 20 eggs
* 50 plant fibers

# Strategy

**Day 1:** The goal is to get into the locker room after the pool and get a basic base setup with storage, hatches, and campfire. Plant trees in the snow above the pool bathrooms. Craft basic tools, sledgehammer, and bow+arrows prior to entering the building. Initial skill points in strength/boomstick/skull crusher for attack, then intellect/physician/engineering/lock picking for medical supplies and forge magazines. Collect XP from all completed challenges.

**Day 2:** Get a cooking pot and clear floors 1, 3, and 2. Start building a supply of water and convert as much as possible to red tea to slow hunger. Add skill points in iron gut and lucky looter, all additional point in sledgehammer and shotgun related skills. Take any vitamins found immediately to avoid infection.

**Day 3:** Depending on the weapons available, get through as much of the rest of the POI as possible. My most recent attempts have achieved this goal. DO NOT go down the elevator to the final loot area, instead, break through the double doors at the top of the stairway directly in front of the main hotel entrance.

**Day 4:** Move base to the final loot room with a hatch hallway at the top of the stairs. Fill in one side of the hallway with cobblestone to funnel zombies through a smaller choke point and only need to maintain one row of hatches. Usually I can build a forge by this point and create at least 1 iron hatch. All skill points go to strength, sledgehammer, and shotgun skills. Break the window above the couch, next to the water cooler to access the roof near the pool. Place ladders all the way up the column right outside the window for a last resort escape to the roof. The trees around the pool should be at their second growth stage and give 2 seeds each. Chop the trees down and plant them on the roof of the garage. Place dew collectors on the roof. Go around and harvest all of the bodies for the nitrate powder. Create as many farm plots as you can and place them on the roof of the pool food stand, plant the most useful seeds first. **Note:** Craft and dig up dirt blocks repeatedly to multiply clay, a skill point in mother lode will speed this up.

**Day 5:** Spend the day finishing horde defenses and walking the perimeter walls to attract zombies to kill for loot bags. If you've made it this far, you should be able to defend a day 5 horde from a hatch hallway. If things go south, escape out the window and up to the roof until things cool down, but this will severely limit the amount of horde loot awarded.

**Day 6 and beyond:** Skill points from horde night go into fortitude up to level 5. Living off the land should be maxed out prior to the first farm harvest to increase the output and gain a chance for additional seeds. At this point, sustaining life is the top priority. Build up food/water supply and check the perimeter for zombies, bears, and werewolves to bring in for loot/meat.

# Results

It took me about 15 attempts just to get into the main building, past the pool. Then probably another 15 attempts before I cleared the entire POI. If the kitchen on the first floor doesn't have a cooking pot and you don't get enough forge ahead books to make a forge, just take the 'L' and start over. Same for finishing the POI with an infection rate over 15%, unless you get super lucky and find the honey book.

**Successful POI Clears:**

* \>15% infection about 12 times
* No cooking pot or forge about 8 times

**Survival Past First Horde Night**

Usually, if I can clear the POI with a cooking pot or forge, and no infection, then I can make it past the first horde night unscathed. This has only happened 3 times. My tool set usually looks something like:

* High level stone axe or claw hammer
* Double barrel shotgun level 1 or 2
* Pistol level 1-3
* Mid level iron sledge or level 1 steel sledge
* Pipe machine gun level 1
* Coffee, steak and eggs, vitamin
* Mostly base armor

The first time, my hatch hallway wasn't very well fortified so they broke through and I hid/cried on the roof. Then I eventually ran out of food on day 7.

The second time, I got overrun on day 8 by a horde led by 5 radiated screamers and had absolutely no chance of survival. The first radiated screamer got a scream out before I could take her down, then 2 more screamed, then 2 more plus all of her friends. That was an insane amount of zombies for day 8.

The third time, I got to day 10, but the horde was too powerful for my weapons so they eventually broke through around 1am.

# Final Thoughts

How do people like Glock9 survive this? Is my XP multiplier set too high and causing gamestage to rise too quickly related to the gear that I'm finding? I can't imagine that any of the other T5 POIs would be any different. I would love to hear about how others approach this challenge.",1,1733521167.0,7daystodie,0,1.0,False
1h8cgbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1h8cgbj/update_ka_ngilo_nabas_panahon_ron_oi/,Update: Ka ngilo nabas panahon ron oi,"Hello Cebuanos, Soo daghan man jud nag request ninyo og update about ani ako gi post : https://www.reddit.com/r/Cebu/s/pm67rkYB3I 

 kay malipayon man inyong tiyo ron pagbigyan ko kayo

But before that, Sa nagmessege saakoa na i'm promoting pr*ostit*tion daw and nag himo2x rkog story, 
Let me be clear na i'm not promoting, heck kadaghan nag chat sakoa diri asking for info about sa handler but wa ko nako nag share kay naay nag comment na bcn ako rdaw ang handler hahaahhaa, i'm just sharing about my experience and sa akong kaboang ani, also to share with fellow cebuanos about this kalaran kay nag exist jud anhis cebu,
bahala namo anha if mo tuo mo or sa dili, wala man sad koy makuha mag himo2 storya kay di ko author nya di sad ni ma publish, gi chose ra nako anhi sa reddit kay walay nakaila nko and di ko ma judge personally and walay backlash na tabi2 kung buhaton nko ni akong na buhat, My money my rules unta ba ana lang 
hahahahahahaha

Consider this as my Field Report:

Let's call her BabyGirl, soo mao to kay lage inyong tiyo excited gamay ni abot sa meeting place 20 mins earlier hahahahaha, pero na disappoint and nakuyawan inyong tiyo kay Late kaayo si Babygirl (30mins) kay traffic daw. nag overthink nasad ko basin scam ni or gi atngan na kos gawas kay holdap diay, or basin entrapment operation nis pulis  hahahahahahaha

Pero nag update si handler na naa ndaw ( after 30 mins ) , Nka white top and jeans daw suot naa daw nag barog sa entrance dapit, dali rasad nko nakit-an soo akong gi duol ( kulbaan sad ko ani kay basin di nya mao ba ) 
while nag padung ko niya murag nka notice siya so gi tan.aw.ko niya and igo ra nko sha gi tudlo nya gi ask og *her given name from handler*?  and ni tando sha, so mao to i guided her padung sa car, She was saying sorry kay gikan pa daw shas school nya super traffic daw And yes 100% siya jud ang naa sa pic na gihatag sa handler and she's more pretty sa personal, na happy inyong tiyo ani kay di jud diay scam.

soo mao to small talks while driving and nag ask ko if nag dinner na sha, and ni ana sha wala pa daw kay gikan pa sha school, so mao to nag hapit nlang mig drivethru pra naay ma kaon.

pag abot sa motel ( yes motel kay wa ko ka pangandam hahaha ) kay i.gave her the money na nasabutan which is 16k na ako gibutang og envelope, She refused pag dawat personally and asked me na ibutang rdaw nkos iya bag ang envelope which i did, after ato nag talk mi nya kay super tabian and very bubbly  kaayo si babygirl, intong tiyo sige rag ngisi while admiring her aura, beauty and body charoot hahahahaha mura ra ganig barkada kastorya while nag dinner mi, after eating we decided na mag shower then mag cuddle lang sa bed while nagpahuwas sa kabusog hahahahah, and grabe ka tabian jud and clingy hahahahaha to the point na among tabi niabot og 1 hour + among chika/touchy2x, and she's very humot jud and super sweet kaayo murag uyab sa ka sweet ahahaha also na lingaw rsad ko kay among topic is Anime, Girlgroups, and school related stuff niya,
 until na nag lock amo eyes and kissed and mao to start of round 1 hahahahaha di nako mag share maayo diri basta palaban si babygirl and syempre safe sex ta anhi kay naa sad sa rules
i'll rate this round 9/10 na enjoy rko ahahah

so after round 1, we cuddled and chika napud pero ako na mag initiate and asked her a few questions,

Here is what i learned from her

- She's a graduating student na diay, ( she showed me her ID and iya uniform kay naa sa bag niya ) she is doing this kay siya nlang nag support sa iya self, wala sha kaila sa iya dad and her mom passed away late lastyear ( She showed a picture sa puntod sa iya mama taken katong pag kalagkalag daw ) also nag sideline sad siya as tindera daw sa foodstall sa iya uncle na nag pa puyo niya ron. 

- she started doing this daw last may, nag clubbing sila with her classmates and gi doul daw silag Gay nya gi librehan sila og drinks and pulutan, then mao to handler pud diay to ang Gay nya gi recruit sila and kay lage needed daw ni kagat siya og isa ka classmate.

- she's only doing this para daw mka human, next sem ndaw sha mo grad

- panagsa radaw kuno siya mka kuha og client kay daghan kompetensya almost 200 kuno ka girls sila sa ilang GC nya mas i prio kuno sa uban handler ( daghan kuno mga handler ) og hatag ilang mga amiga, swerte rdaw mka kuha og atleast 1 upto 3 ka booking sa isa ka month since naay times na ang booking conflict sa iyang schedule/klase.

- Most Clients daw na mo kuha kay mga Koreans/chinese na nag vacation tour diri sa cebu since naa daw connections mga tour companies sa ilang mga handler nya pakuyugon sila sa island hoping/laag2x sa mga foreigners, panagsa ra kuno mga pinoy kay mostly igo radaw i booking nya dili siputon ( 5x na daw sha ka experience aning fake booking sa mga pinoy).

-Kining mga Koreans kuno kay ubos kuno panan-aw sa ila and murag way respeto, Nka try kuno siya na gi nasamad nya nagkadugo iya baba kay gi sagpa og kusog nya gi tuok, antos nlng daw kay need kwarta, wala siyay ma sumbongan kay nahadlok daw siya.

- naa say offer na dalhon sila og boracay/Manila para adto ibugaw pero wala sha mo sugot kay nag eskwela lage

- biggest client niya kay usa ka mayor ( di lang nko i tell kinsa basta within cebu island ) hahahahaha she showed me a selfie na sila both in bed, Juts daw and 3 minutes ra kuno kaya hahahaahahha, daghan daw og saad nya nangayo pag # niya, pero once rdaw ni take wa na mausab

-ang handlers kay naa sad connections sa mga celebrity, influencers and mga vivamax artists ( she showed me some pictures ani nila from their gc and i was shocked kay follower kos uban nla hahahaha )
Mahal lang daw kuno kaayo 100k+ nya ikaw pa handle sa fare if paanhion nimo diri
She even shared about this celebrity na gi book for 600k sa usa ka politician from bohol nya anhi sa cebu nag meet pag july.

- dako pangayog share ang handler, sa 16k na among sabot 8k ra sa girl kay 2 ka handler mag tunga sa half ( she showed me her convo with them ) i send ra niya via gcash after namo.

inyong tiyo na listener nag comfort2 ni babygirl ani na time hahahahaha

soo ayun na stop diha kay nag lock in nsad amo eyes then nag start round 2, this time nag suggest kog roleplay and nag request na isout iya uniform, ni sugot rapud si babygirl and nag enjoy nsad inyong tiyo
this time 10/10 na ang rating very satisfied hahaahha


after that we talked more and cuddle pero mostly not serious  topics nlang, She asked for my Fb account and added me in her main FB kay she likes my vibe daw and proof na wa siyay uyab (kay ako siya sige sungogon na basin naghuwat na iya uyab) hahahahaha hahahaha

i know there's a possibility na lies rana iyang story pero part of me sad kay murag mo tuo ( i know gullible ko ani na part )
 and if what she said is real, na louy jud kos iya kahimtang. i'm planning to help her survive the last sem pra mka focus siya since mag ojt nsad sha. bahala nsads batman ani hahahahahaa pero wa pa nko gi sulti niya about my plan na mo tabang niya  hahahaha.

soo we decided to end the night and mag coffee nlangs gawas 

fast forward, while naas coffee shop we continued talking about anime and other stuff and my plans sa akong vacation anhis cebu, 
and i told her about my plan na mag suroy2 sa south like badian,moalboal etc, and she said wala pa sha ka suroy adto, i jokingly asked her if gusto sha mo kuyog, nya ni ana sha na yes inig sugod sa sembreak daw nila which is nextweek na, hahaha and i jokingly said na di nako ka afford sa iya rates, og ni ana sha na ako lang daw bahala sa food and accomodation okay na sa iya kay ganahan daw siya sakong vibes

 hahahahahahahaha i guess naa pani part 2 among pagkita ni babygirl hahahahahha

soo ayun gihatud nko siya pauli and nagtahag ko additional tip for her, na nka pa teary eyed niya then mao to end sa akong night  abtan sad mig 3am kapin oi hahahahahaha
 
if naa mo questions, post lang i'll try to answer them 1 by 1 pero matulog sa inyo tiyo kay nahurot ang power hahahaha.


hahahahahahaha mao nto, let me know if ganahn mo mag update ko if madayun mi adtos south ü§£ü§£

also she knows about sa post nko diri sa reddit, i showed her my first post  katong nag coffee mi, funny daw comments, wala siyay idea about reddit. but okay ra niya mag share ko sako experience as long as di ko mag drop og infos about her na mka dox niya.

And sa katong mga nag messege asking info sa handler sorry di ko mo share kay naay ni comment na basin ako daw ang handler  hahahahaha so di nko mo share, Try your luck sa mga clubs basin kamo nasad sunod duolon.

1h8cd44,https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCC_Stock/comments/1h8cd44/update_black_rifle_energy_is_live/,UPDATE: Black Rifle Energy Is Live,"I tried updating my earlier post with the following, but for some reason it wasn't working so made a new post for it:

I've tried each flavor now. I am surprised by how much I like them. Freedom Punch reminds me of Haiwaiian Punch and Wild Frost reminds me of a tarter version of Gatorade Frost (in a good way). Project Mango might be the most ""unique"" flavor. Ranger Berry is the most surprising to me (it's less sweet than I thought it would be with ""berry"" in the title).

Each drink is crip and refreshing. They also aren't overly carbonated. Although I don't drink energy drinks, I could see myself reaching for one of these on a hot summer day.

I think this is good news for the company. Instead of RTD coffee, which I don't think tastes very good, I think these drinks will offer consumers a much better cold alternative to support BRCC. Given most of the company's consumers are in the south and southwest, especially Texas, I wouldn't be surprised if these energy drinks come to drive meaningful revenue growth.

I was initially skeptical of these drinks given the company's expertise is in coffee and the fact that according to their financial statements it doesn't look like it invested a ton of resources developing them (given the company's partnership with KDP, these costs may not be fully reflected on BRCC's statements).

My conclusion is the company has a great product here. I'm excited for 2025.",1,1733520811.0,BRCC_Stock,0,1.0,False

I tried my luck buying a used Gaggia Classic Pro. It ended up having a few problems so I am learning as I go. 

So far these are the things I've done:

1. Replaced the input and output silicone tubes as there was a buildup of black mold.

2. Descaled the machine, and back flushed with Cafiza.

3. Following point 2 the machine would fail to dispense water through the grouphead. So I disassembled, and serviced the boiler, and three way solenoid with descaler. I cleaned the grouphead with Cafiza replacing its silicone gasket, changed the opv spring to a 9 bar one, also removing but not touching the steam wand. Afterwards, I reassembled it, and it dispenses water again.

There lies the problem, giving my machine time to warm up; it takes almost 10-15 seconds before it reaches its peak output. Moreover, even at its peak it does not come close to the flow one can expect 9 grams per second. Guidance would be greatly appreciated.

One more thing, I also came across this piece and I'm unsure whether it's part of the coffee machine. Could someone confirm whether it's part of it.

Hey there! Ready to discover a game-changing way to drive massive traffic to your links? I've got something exciting to share with you today. It's called Leadify, and it's revolutionizing how we think about online traffic. Let me walk you through my experience with this incredible tool.

# What is Leadify?

Leadify is the new kid on the block when it comes to traffic generation. Launched on December 4, 2024, it's an AI-powered system that promises to deliver laser-targeted visitors to any link you choose. And the best part? You can do it all while staying completely anonymous.

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Another traffic tool? Really?"" But trust me, Leadify is different. It's not just another rehashed method or a complicated system that takes forever to learn. It's simple, effective, and designed for both newbies and seasoned marketers alike.

# The Brains Behind Leadify

Before we dive deeper, let's talk about the masterminds behind this tool. Leadify is the brainchild of Fergal Downes and his team. These guys have been in the online marketing game for over 20 years, generating multiple 7-figure incomes. So when they come up with something new, you know it's worth paying attention to.

# Leadify Features: What's Under the Hood?

Let's break down what makes Leadify tick:

# 1. Groundbreaking AI Traffic System

At the heart of Leadify is its AI-powered traffic system. It's unlike anything I've seen before. The AI does the heavy lifting, finding and directing high-quality, targeted traffic to your links.

# 2. User-Friendly Interface

One thing I love about Leadify is how easy it is to use. The interface is clean and intuitive. If you can copy and paste, you can use Leadify. It's that simple.

# 3. Niche Versatility

Whether you're into affiliate marketing, e-commerce, or any other online business, Leadify has got you covered. It works across various niches, making it a versatile tool for any marketer.

# 4. Anonymity

In an age where privacy is gold, Leadify lets you drive traffic without revealing your identity. This is huge for those who prefer to keep a low profile.

# 5. No Website Needed

You don't need a fancy website to get started. Leadify works with just a link, making it perfect for affiliate marketers or anyone promoting offers directly.

# 6. Time-Efficient

The creators claim you only need about 30 minutes a day to see results. In my experience, it's pretty close to that. It's a real time-saver compared to other traffic methods I've tried.

# Who Can Benefit from Leadify?

Leadify is like that swiss army knife of traffic tools. It's designed to help:

* Complete beginners who are just starting out
* Experienced marketers looking for new traffic sources
* Affiliate marketers wanting to boost their conversions
* Anyone who wants to save time and money on traffic generation
* People who prefer to stay anonymous online

# How to Profit from Leadify

Now, let's talk money. How can you turn this traffic into cold, hard cash? Here's the deal:

1. Choose Your Offer: Pick an affiliate product or your own offer that converts well.
2. Set Up Your Link: Use Leadify to create your anonymous traffic-getting link.
3. Activate the AI: Let Leadify's AI system go to work, driving targeted visitors to your link.
4. Monitor and Optimize: Keep an eye on your results and tweak as needed.
5. Scale Up: As you start seeing results, reinvest your profits to scale your campaigns.

The key here is consistency. Give it time, and you'll start seeing those commissions roll in.

# My Personal Experience as a Beta Tester

Alright, let me share my own experience with Leadify. I was lucky enough to be a beta tester before the official launch. Here's how it went:

Day 1-3: Setting up was a breeze. I chose a popular affiliate offer in the weight loss niche and created my link through Leadify.

Day 4-7: The AI started working its magic. I saw a steady increase in traffic to my link. What impressed me was the quality ‚Äì these were people actually interested in weight loss products.

Week 2: By the end of the second week, I had made my first sale. It wasn't huge, but it proved the concept worked.

Week 3-4: Things really picked up. I was averaging 2-3 sales per day, with some days hitting 5 sales.

By the end of the month, I had made $423.50 in commissions. Not bad for about 30 minutes of work per day!

# The Leadify Funnel: What's on Offer?

Leadify comes with a few different options to supercharge your results:

* Front End ($12.95): The core Leadify system.
* OTO 1: AI Traffic Surge: Boost your traffic even more.
* OTO 2: AI Traffic Surge Pro: Advanced features for power users.
* OTO 3: DFY ($37): Done-for-you campaigns to get you started fast.
* OTO 4: Mass Traffic ($27): Scale up your traffic to new heights.
* OTO 5: Product Launching Formula ($47): Learn how to launch your own products.

There's also a bump offer called ""Passive Pro"" for $19, which looks interesting for those wanting to automate their income.

# Pros and Cons of Leadify

Let's break down the good and the not-so-good:

# Pros:

* Super easy to use, even for beginners
* Works across multiple niches
* AI-powered, saving you time and effort

# How Leadify Dominates the Competition

Leadify stands out in a crowded market for a few reasons:

1. AI Integration: Most traffic tools don't leverage AI like Leadify does.
2. Anonymity: This is a big deal for many marketers who value privacy.
3. Simplicity: It's way easier to use than many complex traffic systems out there.
4. Cost-Effective: You're not burning cash on expensive ads or time-consuming methods.

# Leadify's Money-Back Policy

Here's something that gave me peace of mind: Leadify offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not happy with the results, you can get a full refund. No questions asked. It shows the creators are confident in their product.

# Pricing: Is It Worth It?

Let's talk numbers. The front-end price of Leadify is $12.95. Yep, you read that right. For less than the cost of a few coffees, you get access to this powerful traffic system.

Now, is it worth it? Based on my experience, absolutely. Even if you only make a few sales, you've already covered your investment many times over.

[Get access to Leadify here](https://softtechhub.us/Leadify)

# Leadify Bundle Deal

During the launch period, there's a special bundle deal available. You get the core Leadify system plus some bonus training materials. It's a great way to get started if you're serious about making this work.

# When and Where Can You Get Leadify?

Leadify launched on December 4, 2024, at 11:00 EST. You can access it through their official website or through authorized affiliates.

# Support: Got Questions?

One thing I always look for is good support. Leadify doesn't disappoint here. They offer customer support to help you with any issues or questions. The team is responsive and knowledgeable.

# Platform Compatibility

Leadify is web-based, so you can access it from any device with an internet connection. Whether you're on a PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone, you're good to go.

# Bonus Time!

When you purchase Leadify, you don't just get the main product. They're throwing in some pretty sweet bonuses:

1. Tribe: Learn how to build a Facebook group of up to 14,000 members in any niche.
2. Middle Man Money: Make money on Fiverr by outsourcing high-value gigs.
3. 7 Day Marketer: Set up an online and offline web design business.
4. Niche Domination Prodigy: Dominate any niche using parasite SEO.
5. ScriptBlasta: AI-powered tool for creating conversion-focused video ad scripts.

These bonuses alone are worth way more than the price of Leadify itself.

# Should You Use Leadify?

Alright, let's cut to the chase. Should you use Leadify? Here's my take:

If you're looking for a simple, effective way to drive targeted traffic to your links, then yes, absolutely give Leadify a try. It's especially great if:

* You're new to online marketing and need a beginner-friendly system
* You're an experienced marketer looking for a fresh traffic source
* You value your privacy and want to stay anonymous
* You're tired of spending hours on social media or burning cash on ads

However, if you're expecting overnight riches with zero effort, Leadify isn't magic. It still requires some work and patience on your part.

# Wrapping Up: My Final Thoughts on Leadify

After spending a month with Leadify, I'm genuinely impressed. It's rare to find a traffic tool that's both powerful and easy to use. The AI technology behind it is cutting-edge, and the results speak for themselves.

Is it perfect? No tool is. But for the price and with the money-back guarantee, I think it's a no-brainer for anyone serious about boosting their online traffic and sales.

Equipment: SK40 set between 4.5 and 8.5 over 5 different draws

Portafilter: Standard with Bambino using single shot pressurized basket

Beans:  Lavazza Super Crema, no date noted, because its what I have.

Dose:  8-10 grams, I played with this to see if it was affecting it.

Workflow:  Grind, pour into funneled portafilter and lightly shake to distribute, no WDT, tamp with standard tamp (V4 literally just arrived), no pre-infusion just pressing the single shot button ont he bambino after installing the portafilter into the bambino.

All, I've just returned from a work trip, excited to unbox my Bambino and SK40 and am getting zero extraction.  Hopefully it is entirely user error.  I've an SK40 grinder set to 4.5 and have gone up to 8.5 and no luck.  Single Shot pressurized filter basket since my beans are likely a bit old (Lavazza Super Crema, don't judge I've got to empty the bag first).  8-10 g of beans.  I've tried tamping just a little and then tamping closer to what's expected (20ish pounds of pressure).

When I pull the portafilter and rinse the coffee out, \~95% comes out and there is a remaining caked layer at the bottom of the filter basket that I can't even jet out with my sink faucet, I need to lightly scrape with a wooden chopstick.  

During setup of the Bambino, the walkthrough app recommends cycling through the machine with 2 L of water without any coffee in the portafilter.  There's a pre-set programmable method to do this.  I went through this process and the portafilter with a double-sided single shot filter basket only flowed through a single nozzle with the other nozzle barely dripping.  When I pulled the portafilter, it was full of water still.  

Does this sound like old beans problem, filter basket problem, tamping problem, and I just an idiot?

1h8c1zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h8c1zk/i_24m_dont_want_my_girlfriend24f_to_spend_time/,I (24M) don‚Äôt want my Girlfriend(24F) to spend time one-on-one with her Best Friend?,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) since spring 2022. We‚Äôre in a long-distance relationship, but we‚Äôve made it work by seeing each other about every six months, depending on our university and work schedules. Our relationship is healthy‚Äîwe communicate well and have been very close since the beginning. Even with the distance, I‚Äôve always felt loved and desired by her, and I‚Äôve never worried about her cheating, despite the circumstances. She‚Äôs bisexual, many of her friends adore her, and I know it would be hard for me to know if something happened. Still, I‚Äôve always trusted her.

That changed earlier this year when she started attending a weekly house party hosted by a friend. At these parties, she became close with Alex (24M, non-binary), who is in a relationship and hosted the events. Alex and my girlfriend began spending more time together. At first, I was happy for her new friendships, but Alex started frequently inviting her out for coffee or drinks and telling her they missed her when she couldn‚Äôt make it to the party. I began feeling uncomfortable when I noticed how much Alex seemed to push for one-on-one time with her.

One morning, I FaceTimed her after she texted me, but she seemed dismissive, saying she was busy. It wasn‚Äôt until I asked several questions that she admitted Alex was with her, helping plan an event for a university club. This was unusual because she‚Äôs never been dismissive with me before. Later, Alex began showing up at her place unannounced or asking to hang out late at night. Sometimes, she‚Äôd cut our calls short to spend time with them.

One night, Alex invited her to a bar after work. She kept updating me every 30‚Äì60 minutes, but then she went silent for 2‚Äì3 hours. I checked Life360 (an app we use to stay safe), and it showed she was at a park near a river around 1‚Äì2 a.m. This park is isolated, and we‚Äôve even had sex there during the day, so I know how private it is. When I called, she said they were just talking, but I was upset she hadn‚Äôt told me. Later, she admitted that Alex had invited her earlier in the night, she said no, but after they‚Äôd been drinking, Alex pressured her into going. She agreed that this was unacceptable and promised to distance herself from Alex, which she did‚Äîreducing their hangouts from three times a week to about once.

Despite this, Alex still kept inviting her to spend time alone. For example, on Alex‚Äôs birthday eve, they texted her at 11:50 p.m. to get takeout together. She felt pressured and went with them, spending their birthday together for about 20 minutes. Around the same time, my mom became seriously ill with a persistent cough, and I was debating whether to visit my girlfriend or stay to care for her. On the day I had to decide, I also had a final exam and experienced a car breakdown on the highway, which led to a panic attack. My girlfriend was out with Alex at a farm sale two hours away and wasn‚Äôt fully available to support me. I ended up flying to see her, and she and Alex drove two hours to pick me up from the airport late at night. I appreciated it, but it made me question why Alex was so willing to go to such lengths for her.

During this trip, I noticed more red flags. One day, I grabbed her phone to play something, but she snatched it back, which she‚Äôs never done before. I later asked to go through her phone, and while I didn‚Äôt find evidence of cheating, I found some conversations with Alex that felt inappropriate. For instance, after a party, Alex texted her, ‚ÄúHey, by any chance, did you hear the rumor I have a big dick?‚Äù Apparently, Alex‚Äôs partner had drunkenly told some people this, but my girlfriend had no idea. To me, this seemed like a strange and inappropriate way to bring up the topic.

We talked about these messages, and she promised to let me know if Alex ever said anything inappropriate again. However, I‚Äôm skeptical, as it would seem odd if their dynamic immediately changed overnight. Around this time, I also noticed her passion for me, particularly sexually, had started to decline. She attributed this to her depression, but the timing coincided with her growing closeness to Alex and her new social life, which made me wonder if something else was affecting her feelings toward me.

After I returned home, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer, and my depression and overthinking spiraled. My girlfriend has been supportive, though I wish she‚Äôd wake up earlier (she typically wakes up between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.) to spend more time with me. Recently, Alex invited her on a camping trip, which would involve them sleeping in the same car. Given their history, I didn‚Äôt feel this was appropriate and voiced my concerns. She dismissed my feelings, saying my insecurities stem from Alex‚Äôs transition and that they‚Äôre mostly asexual, so I have no reason to worry. However, my discomfort has never been about Alex‚Äôs gender or sexuality‚Äîit‚Äôs about the frequency, intimacy, and exclusivity of their time together.

I asked her what she would do if I asked her to stop spending time alone with Alex, and she said she wouldn‚Äôt agree, as she believes my concerns come from my own depression and insecurities. While they do hang out less now (once every two weeks), I feel it‚Äôs more due to their busy schedules than a conscious effort to set boundaries. I don‚Äôt feel she‚Äôs cheated on me but I just don‚Äôt know how to keep handling that feeling that someone I don‚Äôt like gets to spend time one-on-one alone with my GF when I feel so miserable and have to go through so much feeling undesired.

Perhaps, to become friends. Relationship is an option, if we both will want it, but it's not the top priority. 
The thing is, I'd like to find ""that one"" kind of a person. Who will care about you, prioritize you, another words, have a special place in their heart. Who will understand you, and it doesn't matter that you're so different. Of course, all of this also applies to you.
Idk if that's possible, but worth a try anyway.

About me:

- nerdy 
- currently studying at college and so some side sort of jobs
- like deep and long conversations. Like, sometimes I feel like I can ramble about things even for hours
- carrying. If you had a bad day, I'd do my best to support you and make you feel better
- kind of a weirdo. Or people describe me as such. I don't drink or smoke, I don't drink coffee. I don't even watch shows much. I only recently have discovered classics like Breaking Bad.
- can be a bit shy
- play games (PC), but don't have much time for this now

Btw, include a word ""orange"" in your message if you want to reach out. It's just to make sure you read it

Soo, as for my appearance, I'm 6'1 tall, white, skinny. Don't really know what to add here haha.

Etc. there's always a new version of whats to come. Current currency system is flawed and eventually we will have to move on to something else. Current currency system is flawed and eventually we will have to create a solution to its biggest issue, the time it takes to transfer large sums of wealth. Cryptocurrency is that new shiny technology, and XRP aims exactly at solving that issue. More development will flow to it. This scenario is inevitable. But zoom out, and realize how this is literally the beginning of this platform, and you are here, present, to do something about it with it. (Reminder XRP was .50 last month. Bitcoin in 2016 was also cheap). In a span of a decade bitcoin became a solid platform to store value. Now think in two decades from now, what would bitcoin look like at this pace? 
No fud, crypto will happen with or without you. Look at other countries arming up their own versions of crypto. The IDEA of crypto has matured and our leaders are finally beginning to do something about it. But now, XRP if it does become THE bridge, our future families will undoubtedly hang paitings of our smug faces on their walls for blessing them with generational wealth. New millionaires made because of inflation is one thing, but this new wave of millionaires from XRP will be extremely different, in a platform with no true market cap. You'll be a part of a game played only by the elites of the world. The bloodline of banks to transfer money amongst each other between different countries. The blood of a TRUE crypto utility. So with that said, i'm putting another $250 in this. And will continue to DCA, like i shouldve been. Proud to be a future Ripplellionaire.

tl;dr: crypto is still young. Xrp will be a part of the biggest platform in the world, the banking platform, spanning the entire globe, and you would have entered before entire countries do so. ",9,1733519816.0,XRP,2,1.0,False

We requested to have my 'tissue' (fallopian tube and baby) returned to us and we decided to plant our baby P under an olive tree. I wasn't sure at the time if this would help me in my healing or not, but now, two months post planting and three months post surgery, I can say that it has definitely helped me. 

Right now I am sitting outside in the sun enjoying my morning coffee, looking at our beautiful olive tree and noticing how much it has grown. I think that being able to nurture this tree and watch it grow, and sit outside with it and enjoy some peace and quiet with it, has been incredible healing. I guess it feels like our baby is still growing, but in a new life as our olive tree and it brings me a lot of comfort. 

I guess my point of sharing this is that even in the toughest times, pockets of joy and comfort still exist and I hope that everyone in this page can find their own pockets of joy and comfort in any way that works for them, and if you are considering planting your baby, do it ü©∑ü™Ωüå±",2,1733519541.0,EctopicSupportGroup,1,1.0,False

1h8bvr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1h8bvr5/aio_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriend_to_spend_time/,AIO for not wanting my Girlfriend to spend time alone with her Best Friend,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) since spring 2022. We‚Äôre in a long-distance relationship, but we‚Äôve made it work by seeing each other about every six months, depending on our university and work schedules. Our relationship is healthy‚Äîwe communicate well and have been very close since the beginning. Even with the distance, I‚Äôve always felt loved and desired by her, and I‚Äôve never worried about her cheating, despite the circumstances. She‚Äôs bisexual, many of her friends adore her, and I know it would be hard for me to know if something happened. Still, I‚Äôve always trusted her.

That changed earlier this year when she started attending a weekly house party hosted by a friend. At these parties, she became close with Alex (24M, non-binary), who is in a relationship and hosted the events. Alex and my girlfriend began spending more time together. At first, I was happy for her new friendships, but Alex started frequently inviting her out for coffee or drinks and telling her they missed her when she couldn‚Äôt make it to the party. I began feeling uncomfortable when I noticed how much Alex seemed to push for one-on-one time with her.

One morning, I FaceTimed her after she texted me, but she seemed dismissive, saying she was busy. It wasn‚Äôt until I asked several questions that she admitted Alex was with her, helping plan an event for a university club. This was unusual because she‚Äôs never been dismissive with me before. Later, Alex began showing up at her place unannounced or asking to hang out late at night. Sometimes, she‚Äôd cut our calls short to spend time with them.

One night, Alex invited her to a bar after work. She kept updating me every 30‚Äì60 minutes, but then she went silent for 2‚Äì3 hours. I checked Life360 (an app we use to stay safe), and it showed she was at a park near a river around 1‚Äì2 a.m. This park is isolated, and we‚Äôve even had sex there during the day, so I know how private it is. When I called, she said they were just talking, but I was upset she hadn‚Äôt told me. Later, she admitted that Alex had invited her earlier in the night, she said no, but after they‚Äôd been drinking, Alex pressured her into going. She agreed that this was unacceptable and promised to distance herself from Alex, which she did‚Äîreducing their hangouts from three times a week to about once.

Despite this, Alex still kept inviting her to spend time alone. For example, on Alex‚Äôs birthday eve, they texted her at 11:50 p.m. to get takeout together. She felt pressured and went with them, spending their birthday together for about 20 minutes. Around the same time, my mom became seriously ill with a persistent cough, and I was debating whether to visit my girlfriend or stay to care for her. On the day I had to decide, I also had a final exam and experienced a car breakdown on the highway, which led to a panic attack. My girlfriend was out with Alex at a farm sale two hours away and wasn‚Äôt fully available to support me. I ended up flying to see her, and she and Alex drove two hours to pick me up from the airport late at night. I appreciated it, but it made me question why Alex was so willing to go to such lengths for her.

During this trip, I noticed more red flags. One day, I grabbed her phone to play something, but she snatched it back, which she‚Äôs never done before. I later asked to go through her phone, and while I didn‚Äôt find evidence of cheating, I found some conversations with Alex that felt inappropriate. For instance, after a party, Alex texted her, ‚ÄúHey, by any chance, did you hear the rumor I have a big dick?‚Äù Apparently, Alex‚Äôs partner had drunkenly told some people this, but my girlfriend had no idea. To me, this seemed like a strange and inappropriate way to bring up the topic.

We talked about these messages, and she promised to let me know if Alex ever said anything inappropriate again. However, I‚Äôm skeptical, as it would seem odd if their dynamic immediately changed overnight. Around this time, I also noticed her passion for me, particularly sexually, had started to decline. She attributed this to her depression, but the timing coincided with her growing closeness to Alex and her new social life, which made me wonder if something else was affecting her feelings toward me.

After I returned home, my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer, and my depression and overthinking spiraled. My girlfriend has been supportive, though I wish she‚Äôd wake up earlier (she typically wakes up between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.) to spend more time with me. Recently, Alex invited her on a camping trip, which would involve them sleeping in the same car. Given their history, I didn‚Äôt feel this was appropriate and voiced my concerns. She dismissed my feelings, saying my insecurities stem from Alex‚Äôs transition and that they‚Äôre mostly asexual, so I have no reason to worry. However, my discomfort has never been about Alex‚Äôs gender or sexuality‚Äîit‚Äôs about the frequency, intimacy, and exclusivity of their time together.

I asked her what she would do if I asked her to stop spending time alone with Alex, and she said she wouldn‚Äôt agree, as she believes my concerns come from my own depression and insecurities. While they do hang out less now (once every two weeks), I feel it‚Äôs more due to their busy schedules than a conscious effort to set boundaries.

Am I wrong to feel uncomfortable with her relationship with Alex? Is it unreasonable to ask her to stop spending time alone with them, given the history? Or are my feelings valid?

1h8bvo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albany/comments/1h8bvo0/chatgpt_roasts_the_cities_of_the_capital_region/,ChatGPT roasts the cities of the Capital Region,"Idea shamelessly borrowed from r/jacksonville 

>PROMPT: roast the various cities and suburbs of the capital district.

Ah, the Capital District‚Äîa region that tries its best to combine Albany‚Äôs quirks, Schenectady‚Äôs grit, Troy‚Äôs attempts at rebranding, and Saratoga‚Äôs belief that it‚Äôs too good for the rest of us. Let‚Äôs roast the whole gang, shall we?

# Albany

The capital city where everyone works but no one wants to live. Albany tries so hard to be hip with its coffee shops, art festivals, and rooftop bars, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still Albany‚Äîwhere the potholes are as deep as the corruption. If you want nightlife, just head to Lark Street‚Ä¶ until 9 p.m., when it‚Äôs either dead or devolves into chaos.

# Troy

Oh, Troy. The ""Collar City"" has been polishing its rough edges for decades. Hipsters have invaded with their artisanal donuts and boutique shops, but one wrong turn and you‚Äôre back in Troy Classic‚Ñ¢: where you‚Äôll find dollar stores, crumbling row houses, and someone screaming about their landlord. The Troy Waterfront Farmers‚Äô Market is lovely, but let‚Äôs not pretend it‚Äôs a personality.

# Schenectady

‚ÄúThe Electric City‚Äù is more like a broken lightbulb. Sure, Proctors is a gem, and the Stockade District is charming, but the rest of Schenectady feels like a ghost town that someone tried to gentrify and gave up halfway through. GE left, and Schenectady never really got over it. But hey, Rivers Casino is there if you want to lose money *and* dignity.

# Saratoga Springs

Ah, Saratoga, where the rich and wannabe-rich go to play. If Albany is the kid trying to fit in, Saratoga is the preppy cousin who peaked in high school. The track season turns this quiet town into a zoo of pastel polos, floppy hats, and people yelling ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the Putnam Den!‚Äù at 2 a.m. And don‚Äôt even think about parking downtown during summer.

# Colonie

Suburbia at its peak. Colonie is where Albany residents flee for bigger backyards and better schools but still end up at Crossgates Mall every weekend. Wolf Road is basically a strip mall on steroids, where the traffic never ends, and the food chains outnumber the people. But hey, at least you‚Äôre not in Albany proper.

# Guilderland

Colonie‚Äôs quieter, slightly fancier sibling. Guilderland acts like it‚Äôs above all the chaos, but really it‚Äôs just hiding behind Pine Bush. The most exciting thing here is the *other* side of Crossgates Mall and a surprising number of Dunkin‚Äô Donuts locations. It‚Äôs peaceful, but maybe *too* peaceful‚Äîlike, ""start a knitting circle to pass the time"" peaceful.

# Latham

Latham is where you go when Colonie is just too *Colonie*. It‚Äôs suburban sprawl at its finest: chain restaurants, car dealerships, and roundabouts galore. The most defining feature? Route 9 traffic. The locals swear by Bella Napoli Bakery, but after that, it‚Äôs just strip malls and people who insist they‚Äôre ""five minutes from everywhere.""

# Delmar

Delmar is like the bourgeois cousin of Albany. It‚Äôs full of soccer moms in yoga pants and people who still think going to the Co-op is edgy. It‚Äôs the kind of place where kids ride their bikes without fear, and every front lawn has a Black Lives Matter sign *next* to a Ring camera. Super progressive, as long as you don‚Äôt suggest affordable housing.

# Bethlehem

Bethlehem loves to remind you it‚Äôs not *just* Delmar. There‚Äôs Glenmont, where the people who think Delmar is too snobby hang out, and Selkirk, which might as well be the middle of nowhere. The schools are great, but if you don‚Äôt already have 2.5 kids and a Subaru, you‚Äôll feel out of place.

# Niskayuna

Schenectady‚Äôs fancy cousin that doesn‚Äôt want to be associated with the Electric City. Niskayuna is all about top-tier schools and well-manicured lawns. It‚Äôs quiet, it‚Äôs wealthy, and it‚Äôs boring. The only time anyone talks about Niskayuna is when a new Starbucks opens.

# Clifton Park

The land of McMansions, chain restaurants, and people who think they‚Äôre too cool for Saratoga. Clifton Park is so suburban it hurts, but the locals wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. If you want to see where middle-class dreams go to live, just drive down Route 146 and count the Panera Breads.

# East Greenbush

The land of big-box stores and‚Ä¶ not much else. East Greenbush feels like someone copied and pasted a Colonie template but forgot to add any charm. If you live here, you‚Äôre either commuting to Albany or just couldn‚Äôt afford to live in Delmar.

# Rensselaer

Oh, Rensselaer. You‚Äôre the forgotten stepchild of the Capital District. Your biggest claim to fame is the Amtrak station, which isn‚Äôt even that convenient to get to. Half of Albany commuters have no idea where Rensselaer ends and East Greenbush begins. But hey, at least the rent is cheap!

# Cohoes

‚ÄúThe Spindle City‚Äù is spinning its wheels. Cohoes has some nice waterfront properties and a cute theater, but most of it still feels like Schenectady Lite‚Ñ¢. Every time you think it‚Äôs about to turn a corner, you realize that corner leads to yet another boarded-up building.

# Mechanicville

The smallest city in New York State, but it makes up for it with small-town drama. Mechanicville is the kind of place where everyone knows your business and will happily share it over coffee at the Stewart‚Äôs. At least it‚Äôs got a train station‚Äîthough it‚Äôs mostly for people leaving.

# Waterford

If you‚Äôve ever said, ‚ÄúI love the Erie Canal, but I wish I could live next to it,‚Äù Waterford is for you. It‚Äôs charming in a ‚Äútourist brochure‚Äù way, but don‚Äôt expect much beyond quaintness and a decent annual canal festival.",0,1733519524.0,Albany,5,0.44,False

Idk if that's possible, but worth a try anyway.

- like deep and long conversations. Like, sometimes I feel like I can ramble about things even for hours
- carrying. If you had a bad day, I'd do my best to support you and make you feel better
- kind of a weirdo. Or people describe me as such. I don't drink or smoke, I don't drink coffee. I don't even watch shows much. I only recently have discovered classics like Breaking Bad.

1h8brwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1h8brwj/betterme_steak_and_eggs_diet/,BetterMe: Steak and Eggs Diet,"The steak and eggs diet revolves around‚Äîyep, you guessed it‚Äîsteak and eggs, with no room for carbs, veggies, or sweets (except on your ""cheat day""). The idea is that this high-protein combo can keep you full, help shed belly fat, and build muscle.

ü•© Here‚Äôs the lowdown: you‚Äôll consume 4-6 eggs and 0.75-1.5 lbs of steak per meal, twice a day, all while avoiding calorie counting. Water and black coffee are your only drinks. You can opt for a ""cheat day"" once a week, adding carbs back to your meals.

ü•ö But is this diet really the key to your dream body? Well, studies and reviews show that high-protein diets can help with fat loss and muscle growth, but this one isn‚Äôt balanced, and the lack of variety may lead to nutrient deficiencies. Plus, too much red meat and eggs could raise your cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease and other health issues.

While steak and eggs are a great protein source, a healthier, balanced diet is your best bet for sustainable weight loss and muscle building. So, enjoy your steak and eggs in moderation, but don‚Äôt go all in on this restrictive plan!

‚ùî‚ùî What's your take on the steak and eggs diet‚Äîhave you tried it, or would you consider giving it a go?

I get these sudden images of ""wanting"" to destroy objects, typically the object that I'm currently doing something with. Like now for example, I'm drinking coffee in one of my favourite mugs, but i had this sudden image of throwing it aggressively against the wall/microwave etc, breaking both. 
Sometimes when im outside with friends and we are looking at, say, makeup, i get these forced thoughts and images about destroying it by kicking or punching it. Just things flying everywhere. It can get annoying but sometimes find it funny because it doesn't make sense at all and the image looks funny because I'm the quiet type and the thoughts always potray someone really fast and aggressive. But i don't understand why I'm getting these thoughts more and more.
Although I'm sure that i wouldn't act out on it, i wanted to ask if i should consult my therapist about it and if the thoughts could get worse to the point of me acting out on them?

**Rayne**

September 2018 - a pit bull attacks and kills Rayne, a 6yo German Spitz, owned by Siobhan Butterworth, in the New Zealand district of Timaru. The killer's owner will later dispute this characterization, saying that her dog was a 10-month-old Staffordshire Terrier. It is likely that person's sole complaint about the situation, given that they received zero consequences for their pet's violent behavior. The district has quite strong dangerous dog laws - media states later that ""Under the Dog Control Act 1996, local authorities have the power to seize and euthanise the attacking dog and fine the owner up to $3000 as well as incurring costs for any damage caused by the attack. Timaru district has similar powers under its local bylaws."" But somehow, none of those powers are used in this fatal attack. As media reported at the time, the district official with the power to use those powers chose instead to take a ""more collaborative way"" as part of a recent effort to ""intentionally"" reduce euthanasia of dogs which are brought to her attention through, reading between the lines, acts of violence. Or, as Mrs. Tierney says, ""issues with ownership or training."" 

*‚ÄúOur view is that immediately going into the legal proceedings doesn‚Äôt offer good outcomes for long-term public safety with dogs,‚Äù Timaru District Council group manager of environmental services Tracy Tierney said. ‚ÄúWe approach things in a more collaborative way with the owners, to try and reach a long-term solution that better controls the situation... Only in cases where the owner doesn‚Äôt comply with what we‚Äôve asked would we consider going down the prosecution route... In the case referred to, the owner complied with every request made by us and our animal control staff were confident that any risk to public or animal safety had been mitigated. In cases such as this we wouldn‚Äôt seek prosecution.‚Äù* 

*The Timaru council‚Äôs dog policy states if any injury, significant damage or severe distress has been caused it would consider prosecuting an offender ‚Äì all of which applied in Rayne‚Äôs case. Delegated authority whether or not to proceed with legal action was given to the environmental services group manager, Ms Tierney. ... Previously the council report gave the number of dogs euthanised, but no longer does. In 2007-08 a total of 170 dogs were euthanised. Nor does the Timaru council list the number of dogs impounded.. Ms Tierney did not comment on the council‚Äôs non-reporting of impounding. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been intentionally working over the past few years to reduce the number of dogs unnecessarily euthanised because of issues with ownership or training... We actively seek to rehome dogs that have been surrendered to us to appropriate and properly screened owners who can better manage them.‚Äù*

**Sage**

  
November 22, 2024 - Butterworth is walking her dog Sage, a 6yo rescue who is also a therapy dog, at Ashbury Park when 2 large pit bull mixes erupt from the back of a pickup truck (I think I'm translating ""ute"" correctly) and attack Sage. A woman drinking coffee inside her car at a McDonald's beside the park sees the truck pull into the lot, and sees the dogs leap down and race into the park. She alerts the truck's driver and both of them follow the dogs into the park and try to stop the attack on Sage. Only when more people from the McDonald's join them in the effort are they collectively able to end the attack. And frankly, it's likely that the pit bulls had at this point begun to lose interest as Sage was likely either dead or completely limp and no longer a fun toy. 

The pit bulls bite the coffee woman as she struggles with them, and she has their photo - the owner surrenders them and they are euthanized.

**The previous deadly attack at Ashbury Park - Tilly.**

May 6, 2024 - a woman walks her small Jack Russell mix, Tilly, who is only around a year old, to Ashbury Park. Her dog is sniffing other little dogs when a pit bull appears and attacks Tilly. It bites Tilly in the neck and shakes her. Tilly's owner and the other small dogs' owners get it off Tilly, but it re-attacks, biting into her stomach and killing her. A man pops up from the direction from which the pit bull had appeared, denies being the pit's owner and hurriedly vamooses - and the pit bull follows him. Neither is ever found.

*Statistics show no dog owner was prosecuted in the Timaru district in 2015-16, 2016-17, or 2017-18 after a total of seven owners were prosecuted in 2014-15 and four in 2013-14.*

*Sage, a*¬†[*St John therapy dog*](https://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/125677858/st-john-to-launch-pet-therapy-in-south-canterbury?videoId=6332331294112)*, and Butterworth were out walking in Timaru‚Äôs Ashbury Park on November 22, when two ‚Äúbig pit bull-cross‚Äù dogs attacked.*

*‚ÄúIt is absolutely dreadful,‚Äù Butterworth said.*

*Butterworth, who lost another dog in similar circumstances six years ago, is demanding change and wants more support offered to victims of such attacks.*

*She said Sage was friendly and loved people.*

*‚ÄúBeing a therapy dog, I used to take Sage to rest homes every week.*

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm crushed. My sister has flown in from Australia to support me because this is the second time I have lost a pet to the same circumstances.*

*‚ÄúShe was my world. I do not have any family in Timaru and she was my family.*

*‚ÄúI am not coping well.‚Äù*

*Butterworth said she was thankful to those who came to her aid that day and to those who drove her and Sage to the vet.*

*She said Sage was a rescue dog, which she adopted after her german spitz, Rayne, was attacked in 2018.*

*She now wants to see dog control officers patrolling the community, and suggested CCTV cameras be installed in all Timaru parks.*

*‚ÄúSix years ago when I lost Rayne, I did not get much support and I want to see more support for people who are victims of dog attacks.‚Äù*

*Butterworth is planning to open a bank account to help support victims of such attacks to cover costs, such as counselling and vet bills.*

*‚ÄúI know it will happen again unless something is done about it, but I just wanted to start something for people so they know they have some support.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWe can confirm that the dogs in question were surrendered to council and euthanised following the incident.‚Äù*

*In May,*¬†[*one-year-old jack russell-cross, Tilly, was mauled to death by a dog*](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350269969/woman-devastated-after-dog-mauled-death-timaru-park?_gl=1*1xla9mh*_ga*ODA3NzAwMjU0LjE3MzM1MTY0Njc.*_ga_P3Q4DDZ07F*MTczMzUxNjQ2Ni4xLjEuMTczMzUxNjQ5My4zMy4wLjA.)¬†*in the same park.*

*A Timaru woman, who was the first one at the scene to help Butterworth and Sage, said she saw the ‚Äúbig pit bull-cross dogo argentinos‚Äù at the back of a ute before they ran off.*

*‚ÄúI was drinking a coffee in my car at the McDonald‚Äôs car park and I saw a ute drive in.*

*‚ÄúI had my bull dogs in the car with me and they started barking when they saw the dogs.*

*‚ÄúBoth the dogs on the ute made a noise and jumped off and just took off into the park.*

*‚ÄúI got out and ran into the park following them screaming for the guy \[dogs‚Äô owner\] to get out ... because he would not have known the dogs got off the back.‚Äù*

*She followed them and tried to get them off Sage.*

*‚ÄúBoth dogs were on her shaking her around ... I just could not get them off at the same time.‚Äù*

*She said the owner was unable to get his dogs off or control them. Eventually, a family dining at McDonald‚Äôs came to their aid and they were able to get the dogs off, she said.*

*‚ÄúIt was devastating, seeing the little dog killed in front of us. The lady who owned it had just collapsed on the ground screaming and crying.*

*‚ÄúShe was quite traumatised. She was crying and screaming for us to save her dog but we could not save it.‚Äù*

*In the process of trying to save Sage, the woman suffered puncture wounds and went to hospital.*

*‚ÄúThe dogs did not try to bite me but I got bit because I was in the way trying to save the little dog.‚Äù*

*She said she had been left feeling guilty as she knew they were going to attack something when she saw them leave the ute.*

*‚ÄúYou can tell by the speed at which they jumped off the back of the ute. They launched off and they were doing a hunting bark.*

*‚ÄúI have replayed it in my mind so many times and I wish that I had a weapon or something to get the dogs off.‚Äù*

*She said had Sage not been there, someone else would have been attacked.*

*‚ÄúThere were four or five people walking in the park with their dogs. There were children at playground.*

*‚ÄúI would hate to see what would have happened, because these were big dogs in a frenzy.‚Äù*

*She said she would like to see more proactive policing of dogs in public places.*

*‚ÄúDog control officers respond after an incident. Why wait for an incident?‚Äù*

*She said she would also like to see more education and training to teach people how to c*ontrol their dogs.

*A Timaru woman has been left heartbroken after her one-year-old special needs dog was mauled to death by another dog in a popular park in the town on Monday.*

*‚ÄúI feel as if I have lost the most important living thing in my daily life. My best companion has gone forever.‚Äù*

*The woman, who did not wish to be named, said she took Tilly, her jack russell cross, for a ‚Äúbig walk‚Äù on Monday, before entering Ashbury Park at 11.30am. The park is a designated off-leash exercise area for dogs.*

*‚ÄúI turned my back to talk to some other dog owners at the park and all our three wee dogs were sniffing each other near us,‚Äù she said.*

*‚ÄúThis big, solid-built dog, which I think is a pit bull mix, which was fawn, white with a pink nose, came out of nowhere, lunged at us and went straight to Tilly‚Äôs jugular and shook her.‚Äù*

*She said she, and the two other dog owners, managed to the get the big dog off Tilly but the dog lunged again and grabbed Tilly‚Äôs stomach and ‚Äúthat was it‚Äù.*

*She said there was a man who came to the scene from the direction of where the big dog came from after hearing her cries for help.*

*When she asked him if he was the owner of the big dog, he said he was not and hurriedly walked away from the area and the big dog followed.*

*Tilly, who had been cremated on Tuesday, was born with a birth defect which made her tongue stick out of her mouth.*

*‚ÄúShe was a special dog,‚Äù the woman said.*

*‚ÄúWe hand reared her since birth and my daughter used to do the night feeds.‚Äù*

*The woman‚Äôs daughter said she formed ‚Äúsuch a strong bond‚Äù with Tilly after noticing she was not able to feed from her mother from day one, and bottle fed her day and night.*

*‚ÄúShe had such a big personality and was a massive part of our family. I am absolutely devastated her life has been ripped away by the actions of another dog,‚Äù the daughter said.*

*The woman is now worried for other users of the park which has sports fields and a children‚Äôs playground.*

*‚ÄúI am terribly concerned this dog remains at large. It will almost certainly try to kill again, given the opportunity,‚Äù she said.*

*‚ÄúOnce a dog kills, it will kill again.‚Äù*

*Timaru District Council group manager corporate and communications Stephen Doran‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã confirmed the council was aware of the incident and an investigation had been launched.*

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôd ask any members of the public who may have witnessed the incident at Ashbury Park yesterday, and have information that could help us, to get in touch,‚Äù Doran said.*

*‚ÄúIt would be inappropriate to comment at this time‚Äù.*

*A police media spokesperson said police had been notified of the incident at 12.05pm on Monday by a member of the public who advised a dog had been killed by another dog at Ashbury Park.*

*‚ÄúWhen police arrived at the park a few minutes later, everyone involved had already left the park ‚Äì the person with the offending dog, the person with the deceased dog, and the person who had called police (who witnessed the incident).*

Mostly a vent here, though some advice on how I could better use the system might be appreciated. But I feel like I've tried it all. Activity mode hasn't worked, raising my correction targets hasn't worked. I kinda just can't with this thing anymore. It sucks because in the 2ish years that I've been on the automated system, my A1Cs have come down from high 7s to high 6s, so it is definitely having a positive impact on my long-term quality of life. But in the short term? This is getting really, really old.

In the photo above, my last bolus was 3U at 11:04am to correct a BG of 283 which ended up there because I did not dose my bagel + coffee right this morning. My correction factor is 35, so this should have landed me around 180ish...which seemed to be the result as of about 1pm. At 1:30, I took a shower, which often does drop my BG (as seen here) when I have insulin on board. But it only dropped me to about 125, and then seemed to level out. So there we are at the end of my last dose's 3-hour activation period (my metabolism tends toward the faster side too) apparently sitting pretty right near my OP5's target BG of 120.

Lol. Just kidding. It overdoes it, just like it always seems to overdo it, and I go low. I treat this low by  drinking about 30g worth of maple syrup directly out of the bottle, followed by 15g worth of glucose tablets. You might wonder why I take such a savage approach to this. It's because I am COMPLETELY OVER these stupid fucking lows. I made sure to leave breathing room with this correction because I knew I was going to walk my dog around 3pm.

And, well, you can see exactly what I got for daring to do that. Again, I will reiterate, by the time I go low again, I have not given a bolus in nearly 5 hours. 

I'm just over it. To me, this completely misses the point of what this system is supposed to do for me. Don't get me wrong, I love that it brings down my A1Cs, and I love what it does to protect me from potentially deadly overnight lows. But to me, the main point of a system like this is to reduce the disease burden that diabetes places on my life. Having to stop what I'm doing and treat some spontaneous, bullshit low every couple goddamn hours does NOT reduce that burden.",6,1733518797.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

Aging is inevitable, but how we age is largely influenced by the choices we make every day. Among these choices, the food we consume plays a pivotal role in preserving our health, vitality, and quality of life as we grow older. From nutrient-packed superfoods to simple dietary adjustments, what goes on your plate can make a profound difference in how well you age.

# How Does Food Impact Aging?

Healthy aging isn't about turning back the clock‚Äîit's about feeling stronger, thinking sharper, and staying independent for years to come. [**Nutrition**](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition) is at the heart of this process for several reasons:

* **Cell regeneration:** The nutrients in your food help repair and regenerate cells, keeping your body resilient against the wear and tear of time.
* **Energy production:** A balanced diet ensures your body has the fuel it needs for daily activities, keeping fatigue at bay.
* **Disease prevention:** Proper nutrition can lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other chronic illnesses often associated with aging.
* **Cognitive health:** Certain nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, are linked to better brain function and reduced risk of memory-related conditions.

With a deeper understanding of how food impacts aging, let's dig into which nutrients and dietary habits matter most.

# Essential Nutrients for Healthy Aging

**1. Protein for Muscle and Strength**

Muscle mass naturally declines with age‚Äîa process called sarcopenia. To combat this, protein is a must. It helps rebuild and maintain muscle tissue, keeping your body strong and functional.

**Best Protein Sources:**

* Lean meats (chicken, turkey)
* Fish (salmon, tuna)
* Eggs
* Plant-based options like lentils, chickpeas, tofu, and nuts

*Quick tip*: Spread protein consumption evenly across meals for better absorption and improved muscle maintenance.

# 2. Calcium and Vitamin D for Bone Health

Osteoporosis becomes a common concern among older adults, with brittle bones increasing the risk of fractures. Calcium and vitamin D work together to keep [**bones strong**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/12-ways-what-you-eat-affects-your-health/) and healthy.

**Top Picks:**

* Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese)
* Fortified plant-based milk (almond or soy)
* Leafy greens (kale, spinach)
* Fatty fish (sardines, salmon)

Don‚Äôt forget sunlight‚Äîyour body produces vitamin D when exposed to the sun. Try spending 10‚Äì15 minutes outdoors daily.

**3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Cognitive Health**

Memory loss and cognitive decline don't have to be par for the course with aging. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish and certain plant oils, are known for their brain-protective powers.

**Sources of Omega-3s:**

* Salmon, mackerel, and trout
* Chia seeds and flaxseeds
* Walnuts
* Algae-based supplements (for plant-based diets)

Studies suggest omega-3 fatty acids can also reduce inflammation, which is a significant contributor to chronic illnesses like arthritis and [**heart disease.**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/actionable-steps-to-start-improving-your-heart-health-today/)

# 4. Fiber for Digestive Health

Digestive issues, from bloating to constipation, often come with age. High-fiber foods promote gut health by keeping your digestive system functioning smoothly and effectively.

**Fiber-Rich Foods to Try:**

* Whole grains (quinoa, oats, brown rice)
* Fruits (apples, pears, berries)
* Vegetables (broccoli, carrots, artichokes)
* Legumes (black beans, lentils)

Pair fiber with adequate water intake‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for optimal digestion.

# 5. Antioxidants for Fighting Free Radicals

Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals, unstable molecules that can accelerate aging and lead to chronic diseases. These powerhouses come from brightly colored fruits and vegetables.

**High-Antioxidant Foods:**

* Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries
* Dark chocolate (the higher the cocoa content, the better)
* Green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale)
* Nuts and seeds

Aim to eat the rainbow‚Äîdiverse colors often mean a wider range of antioxidants.

# 6. Hydration for Vital Body Functions

Dehydration can lead to fatigue, confusion, and even urinary tract infections, particularly in older adults. Ensuring consistent [**fluid intake**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/raise-your-glass-of-water-to-good-health/) is vital for keeping the body running smoothly.

**Hydration Tips:**

* Keep a water bottle handy throughout the day.
* Include water-rich foods like cucumbers and watermelon.
* Limit dehydrating drinks such as coffee and alcohol.

Aim for 6 to 8 cups of fluids daily, adjusting for activity levels and climate.

# Building a Diet for Longevity

Now that you know which nutrients matter most, how can you incorporate them into your daily meals? Here's a simple action plan:

**1. Adopt a Mediterranean Diet**

Regarded as one of the healthiest diets, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes whole foods like fish, olive oil, nuts, vegetables, and whole grains. Studies show it can lower the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer's, and even early mortality.

**2. Plan Balanced Plates**

Follow the rule of \`half-plate vegetables, one-quarter lean protein, and one-quarter whole grains\`. This ensures an even distribution of key nutrients.

**3. Snack Smart**

Swap out processed snacks for options like yogurt with berries or nuts with dark chocolate.

**4. Avoid ‚ÄúEmpty Calories‚Äù**

Cut down on sugary treats, sodas, and fried foods. These offer little nutrition and contribute to inflammation and weight gain.

**5. Use Meal Prep to Stay Consistent**

Set aside time each week to portion and prep meals. This helps you stick to your healthy eating plan without feeling overwhelmed.

# Small Changes, Big Results

You don‚Äôt need to change everything at once‚Äîsmall, steady steps can make a big difference in your [**health and well-being**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/healthy-aging-habits-nutrition-exercise-and-mental-wellness-for-vitality/). Try swapping one processed snack for a healthier option or adding an extra serving of veggies to your dinner. Every little change brings you closer to feeling your best!

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1h8bd19,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1h8bd19/small_business_advice_cat_cafe/,Small Business Advice - Cat Cafe?,"Hello all - I am a fresh graduate who just started working in the corporate world full-time. I love my job, but I have also always been interested in owning my own business one day. A thought that has been in my head for a while has been the concept of a cat cafe. They don't have one in my town, and I believe it could do fairly well, considering how popular coffee shops are where I'm located. There are lots of college students here, but also many families in surrounding areas (\~150k population).

  
I truly have a passion for cats/animal welfare and have always wanted to do more to help out in some way - I would want to partner with a local animal shelter to encourage adoptions. I also would love to have a coffee shop in general, and I would want this to be a separate part of the cafe which also turns into a small spirits/wine bar in the evening. I know I would have to learn more about the health regulations/certifications/licenses required.

  
These are just my thoughts... but I was wondering if this would be even profitable? I see a lot of cat cafes that have closed, and I don't want this to be a failed venture. I believe this could be my passion, but I don't want to go into debt over something that didn't work out.

  
Any advice from small business or cat cafe owners would be appreciated :)",1,1733518138.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

It all started one fateful Tuesday morning. We had just gotten our usual coffees from our favourite independent cafe, and we were talking in the car about our plans for the upcoming Christmas break. My boyfriend Peter was driving while I was balancing our beverages on my lap in those to-go containers made from recycled cardboard.

We were talking about how his mother would react to his sisters new hair colour, which was a vibrant blue and changed as often as the weather, when all of a sudden his head slowly started turning towards me with the biggest most horrifying grin I‚Äôve ever seen. I was frozen in shock just watching him. ‚ÄúPeter?‚Äù I ask, waving a hand in front of his face. He doesn‚Äôt reply, only staring at me with that eerie grin, never blinking, never moving. The lights that we were waiting at had turned green, and other cars behind us  had started honking in anticipation and frustration.

All of a sudden, Peter seemed to snap back into reality and proceeded to drive through the lights, as if nothing happened. I look at him in awe and can only muster up the words ‚Äúare you okay? What happened there?‚Äù He looks at me blankly as if I was a lunatic. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I disregard it, as he has a habit of playing pranks on me. ‚ÄúHaha very funny.‚Äù I say sarcastically as I roll my eyes. He starts to talk about which hair colour he predicts Greta will get next (probably purple, as she has a clear favourite of cool toned colours) and I seem to relax. 

Silly Peter, always playing tricks on me. 

The next time it happened was two weeks later, on a cosy date night which consisted of us cuddling up on the couch watching some Disney movie, while having some wine and snacks. I paused Moana as she was about to jump into the monster realm at the top of the massive rock-portal thing and asked Peter if he wanted some popcorn. He said yes and so I was rummaging around in our cabinet when I got the spine-chilling feeling I was being watched.

I finally found the popcorn which was hiding at the back behind the cans of tuna, and turn around to lock eyes with my boyfriend of three and a half years staring straight into my soul. His eyes seemed to be bulging out of their sockets, and his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear as he grinned at me not saying anything,not moving anything, just staring at me in deathly still silence.

I was shocked that it happened again, and immediately I just froze up. It must be part of my fight/flight instinct or something, as the last time it happened I couldn‚Äôt move either. I slowly reached for the biggest knife I could see sitting in the knife block on the kitchen countertop. My hands were shaking so much I could barely take the knife out of its place. I never broke eye contact with Peter, in fear that something would happen. 

All of a sudden, the doorbell rang. Who could be ringing the doorbell at 9pm on a Sunday night? I maintained eye contact with Peter, whose spell seemed to be broken as he gave me a funny look and pulled the blanket over his body, so only his head was poking out. I used this opportunity to quickly speed-walk towards the door, and as it swung open, I breathed a sigh of relief. I had always been close with Greta, even if there were 15 years between us. Peter‚Äôs sister tilted her head to the side, as if confused, and asked if I was okay. I wiped the beads of sweat from my forehead and exclaimed ‚ÄúPlease let me stay with you!‚Äù She looked at me with .. pity? ‚ÄúOf course you can, you‚Äôre welcome anytime at my house. Is everything okay in there? How‚Äôs Peter?‚Äù 

He must‚Äôve been listening because he took that opportunity to saunter towards the door. ‚ÄúHello my favourite sister, how are you and how may we help you?‚Äù Her eyes darted between us two, noticing how I was flinching every time he spoke. To me, his words were daggers piercing through my skin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, are you ready for our girls sleepover Emma?‚Äù I suddenly noticed that I was still holding the humongous knife, as I sheepishly looked at her, and replied hastily ‚Äúyes, yes let me grab my bag.‚Äù I gave her a polite nod, and ducked inside.

After placing the knife back into the knife holder, I dashed upstairs and started grabbing whatever I saw and shoving it into an overnight bag. I sprinted downstairs and waved goodbye to Peter from a distance, as I was still shell-shocked from the whole ordeal. As soon as Greta and I shut the car doors in her lime green Honda accord, she looked at me expectantly. ‚ÄúSpill.‚Äù I explained what had happened two weeks ago, and how the same thing had happened just ten minutes ago, but somehow this time was worst than the last. As we entered her driveway, she looked at me and said ‚Äúyou can stay here as long as you want, you‚Äôre safe here.‚Äù As much as I wanted to believe that that was true, deep down I knew that he could find me if he wanted, as he could track my phone. 

Three days I spent worrying and hiding in Greta‚Äôs two bedroom bungalow, peering out the windows and biting my nails in anticipation and fear. Finally, on the third night, it happened.
I had a dream of Peter standing in our driveway, his eyeballs bloodshot and practically popping out of his head, his grin staring from one ear to the other, although this time, something was different. He had shreds of what looked like meat of some kind stuck in his blood stained teeth, which had seemed to turn razor-sharp, and he was chanting ever so softly, ‚Äúcomehomeemmacomehomeemma.‚Äù I woke up screaming and immediately burst into tears but I knew in my heart that it was time to go home. 

Reluctantly, Greta pulled up in the parking spot next to my house, and even though it was broad daylight, my palms became sweaty and my blood ran cold. Grabbing Greta‚Äôs hand, we cautiously approached the house. The front door was wide open, and all of the windows had been broken. ‚ÄúPeter?‚Äù I called out. My eyes darted to the kitchen but all of our knives were nowhere to be seen. Shit. Room by room, Greta and I covered all of them downstairs but Peter was no where to be found. All of a sudden, I heard a faint creaking noise from upstairs. It was that one floorboard in our bedroom, which no matter which way you went it always made a sound. 

Bravely clutching her car keys, Greta led the way upstairs. On edge, we paused, standing in front of the closed bedroom door. Greta mouthed three, two, one and swung the door open. Peter was nowhere in sight. We looked at each other in confusion and I bravely stepped into the room. Greta followed me and I turn around to look at her. My gaze immediately goes to that space that was in between the door and the wall. That occupied space. Before I can even form words with my mouth, that horrible - creature whom I couldn‚Äôt even call my boyfriend anymore, leaps towards Greta and plunges that very same kitchen knife I was holding four days ago into the back of her head. After several seconds which felt like hours, Greta‚Äôs body slumps to the floor, the red blood mixed with her blue hair to create purple. Peter was right after all.

After chilling silence, this thing, grinning as wide as it can, whispers ‚Äúwelcome home emma.‚Äù 
Something snaps in me as I lunge towards the knife in lighting speed, swiftly grabbing it and something takes over me as I start stabbing blindly into the man which I used to love. The whole time, Peter is giggling manically as the knife enters his body. Finally, he stops and the chilling silence takes over. I realise what I have just done. 

I am sitting here, writing to you after moving to another city, at least an hour drive from where these events took place. I am glad my boyfriend died, but I am not so sure that his sister did, otherwise who would be pounding on my door screaming my name?

1h8b9pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/1h8b9pb/making_it_through_a_tough_season_with/,Making it through a tough season with deliberative effort,"Hey guys. I do a lot to help myself with my mental health, and even though I feel very good generally about my life, it's a struggle every day to stay healthy just because I don't always have the instincts to take care of myself, I have a lot of jobs and not as much stability as I'd like, and just life is tough. I don't mean a ""struggle"" in the negative sense, I mean I make it through every day, but I don't want to take it for granted, and figured it's worth airing out in person. Since I've become more conscious of what I'm doing, figured I'd write it down for myself and others.

Challenges right now:

Winter season messing with my sleep and body,  job uncertainty, money troubles, lethargy, having trouble eating enough, ADHD symptoms, fatigue from the work season, spouse is depressed, good friend having a really tough time in life.

Mental health coping mechanisms that are paying off

1) Lifting

Joined a non-judgmental powerlifting gym last month, got back into it after vacay for the first day yesterday. I try and lift something heavy every day if I can. Helps me sleep, helps me have more energy. I like that it's all about heavy weights and not about looks, helps me focus on life from the inside rather than the outside. Then when I happen to notice myself actually looking stronger, I feel good too.

2) Texting back friends with no fear

I have ADHD and social anxiety, first means that I rarely respond in a timely manner, second means I feel all kinds of guilt that I'm some kind of asshole and then I don't feel like responding because I have to confront it. But I'm getting better at just assuming people aren't mad and sending that text back. And saying when I appreciate things. It's helping.

3) Watching a stream of a therapist playing Disco Elysium

I really love the game Disco Elysium for how it models the human psyche, and has a version of gameplay that makes you think about yourself and others. Played it last year and have been thinking about it ever since. I often have a stream or podcast going while I do repetitive or tedious chores - it keeps me from going crazy. Over the last couple months I've started watching a therapist do a playthrough of it that I find interesting because he's always bringing in psychological concepts that I actually remember. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=177SU7ibNDg&list=PLBmriQSLAuRJvLNLhRBNso054qvpsqv3t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=177SU7ibNDg&list=PLBmriQSLAuRJvLNLhRBNso054qvpsqv3t) 

4) The joy of cooking (smoking in particular)

Got a pellet smoker at a huge discount at a street sale and fixed it up with a new fan, and now it works well and I've been smoking chicken in it - going to smoke a bluefish tomorrow. I also have been making Asian food I really love. It turns a tedious chore into something I really look forward to. Right now just cooking for me and my spouse (and little bits to our dog in a side dish if she's good) but now I'm actually looking forward to when I have the chance to bring something to a party or cook for friends over a holiday.

5) Eating enough food

I get stressed because I get hungry, and part of it is that I often I feel like I'm spending too much time or energy eating and ignore my food needs. I often stop eating before I'm really full or satisfied because I feel like I need to get back to work, or that it shouldn't take so much food to fuel me. But when I stop and actually eat enough, I do much better, it really does wonders for my brain. Coffee and ADHD meds are nice, but no substitute for food. It sounds dumb but I don't take it for granted.",2,1733517888.0,malementalhealth,0,1.0,False

1h8b8wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1h8b8wu/hm_dont_thank_god_its_only_tuesday/,"[HM] Don't Thank God, It's Only Tuesday","The office is a terrarium, sealed and buzzing under fluorescent lights that hum with a faint but persistent vibration, the kind that worms its way into your skull if you‚Äôre alone long enough to notice. I come in at 10:04, right within the acceptable margin for our nominally flex-time schedule. My department is open-plan, allegedly optimized for collaboration but mostly just optimized for everyone‚Äôs sense of vague self-surveillance, like a panopticon except the guards are each other.

Patty is already at her desk. Patty is always at her desk. I can‚Äôt remember the last time she wasn‚Äôt at her desk, the same way you can‚Äôt remember the last time the sun didn‚Äôt rise or gravity stopped working. Patty is not just at her desk; she is *of* her desk, a fixture as solid and unavoidable as the stapler or the outbox tray. The C-suite types call her indispensable. To me, she seems trapped. She sees herself as a cornerstone of the operation, irreplaceable, and maybe she is. But that‚Äôs the thing: cornerstones don‚Äôt move. They‚Äôre wedged in, immobile, forever.

Jean, who is theoretically my manager but in practice spends her days managing her caffeine intake, starts up the weekly ritual at the coffee station: ‚ÄúHow was everyone‚Äôs weekend?‚Äù The question is purely ceremonial, like singing the national anthem before a game.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù someone says.

‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù says another.

‚ÄúAll good.‚Äù

The usual liturgy.

And then Patty starts in. Patty‚Äôs voice is the sound of fluorescent lights made verbal, that soft, droning hum that‚Äôs impossible to fully tune out. She tells us about her date‚Äîher *latest* date‚Äîanother non-starter in what seems like an endless supply of non-starters.

‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúI mean, he‚Äôs just not‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs too‚Ä¶‚Äù

It‚Äôs never her. It‚Äôs always him. Or them. Or the world. Patty‚Äôs litany of disappointments isn‚Äôt just a mirror; it‚Äôs a funhouse mirror, distorted and vaguely threatening, reflecting back every insecurity I refuse to acknowledge in myself. I tell myself that at least I reflect. At least I know when I‚Äôm being unbearable. That counts for something. Right?

Then she looks at me. Directly at me. I‚Äôve made the mistake of locking eyes. There‚Äôs no escape now.

‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúHow was *your* weekend?‚Äù

The truth is complicated. Saturday night I went cruising, which is a sanitized way of saying I drove to the park, parked the car, and sat there scanning for something I don‚Äôt quite know how to name. Maybe connection. Maybe validation. Maybe just someone whose face I wouldn‚Äôt hate looking at in the morning. I don‚Äôt find what I‚Äôm looking for, not really, so I drive home at 1:37 AM, listening to Nine Inch Nails and trying not to feel like a clich√©.

But that‚Äôs not what I say. What I say is, ‚ÄúQuiet. I went for a night run.‚Äù

The lie feels clean, manageable. Healthy, even. But Patty seizes it like a cat batting a feather toy.

‚ÄúMust be nice,‚Äù she says, her voice tilting up at the end, loud enough for the room to hear. ‚ÄúJust going out whenever you want. If only we girls could do that.‚Äù

The ‚Äúwe girls‚Äù lands heavy in the room. Patty‚Äôs an expert at this: weaponizing inclusivity to isolate you, like a kid in a schoolyard picking teams for kickball. Around us, heads nod. Affirmations ripple outward. I sit there, a man in a sea of women, insulated from HR due to my inclination of playing for the same team but not from Patty‚Äôs vaguely pitying gaze. I don‚Äôt say anything. What‚Äôs there to say?

She doesn‚Äôt stop. Patty rarely stops. She talks about how she‚Äôd love to be more active but just doesn‚Äôt have the time, how she admires my fitness, how impressive it is that I make it look so effortless. Her compliments are always double-edged, more like darts aimed with unsettling precision.

I nod and smile, pleasant as always, but I‚Äôve already tuned her out. My attention drifts to her lips, shiny with grease. It‚Äôs not lip gloss; it‚Äôs McGriddle residue, a feature as consistent as her attendance record. Patty‚Äôs McDonald‚Äôs runs are part of her mythology. She loves to talk about her iced coffee rewards points, how she‚Äôs hacked the system like she‚Äôs a modern-day Robin Hood. One time, she brought me a coffee unprompted, but I couldn‚Äôt stomach the carbs, so I gave it to a janitor.

The grease on her lips catches the light, forming abstract shapes like a Rorschach blot. There are crumbs, too, dotting the pale expanse of her chin. Her second chin, faint but undeniable, quivers slightly as she talks, a minor tremor that somehow feels seismic. Her voice is a subwoofer, reverberating through the room, through me.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that right?‚Äù she says, snapping me back to the present.

‚ÄúAbsolutely, Patty,‚Äù I say, my voice even, unremarkable. ‚ÄúYou always have such a unique way of looking at things.‚Äù

Her face lights up, and for a moment, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve handed her a bouquet of roses. I exhale quietly. The moment passes. The terrarium hums on.",1,1733517830.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1h8b3ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8b3ey/i_think_my_new_bong_is_haunted/,I Think My New Bong Is Haunted,"If I use the bong again will the man come for me?

Sorry, I‚Äôm just scared. I don‚Äôt even think I can go home. 

Sorry, let me start at the beginning.

I only wanted a new bong. Turns out I should have just stuck with the old one. 

When I woke up on Saturday morning I still felt exhausted. I didn‚Äôt have any plans for the weekend, and really just felt like staying in. I knew I had some errands to run, so I figured the quicker I got those done, the quicker I could get to relaxing.

While I was out running errands, I was passing by a smoke shop on the way out of town. I started thinking that I hadn‚Äôt bought myself a new piece in a while, and my bong at home was a couple years old now. So I figured why not? I turned my car around and headed back to the shop.

I walked into the shop and was immediately greeted by three bored looking employees behind the front counter. After a quick look around the shop I realized that I was the only customer. 

The smoking stuff was in the back behind a large wall, they kept it separate from all of the regular band shirts and novelty items. As I walked behind the wall one of the employees followed me in and walked behind the counter. We made awkward eye contact and I saw that her name tag said ‚ÄúMelissa‚Äù and under that it said ‚ÄúStore Manager‚Äù.

It felt awkward while I looked at everything as she just waited for me to make a decision. I asked her to take out a few pieces for me, but didn‚Äôt really like anything that I looked at. 

I was just about to leave and call it quits when I saw a bong on the floor, it was kind of tucked away in the corner.

I pointed to the bong and asked Melissa if I could see it. She looked kind of confused when I had first asked, like she didn't know that the bong was there. When she picked up the piece she looked at it like she had never seen anything like it before, when earlier she was able to name the specific glass blowers of all the bongs that she had handed to me.
Before giving me the bong she seemed to be giving it an extremely thorough inspection. She was pulling out the stem and everything. Flipping the bong over and seriously inspecting it. 

She told me that she wasn‚Äôt sure where this piece came from, and that she didn‚Äôt remember ordering it. 

As I was checking out the bong one of the other employees stepped behind the counter, it looked like he was headed towards the door behind the counter but he stopped when he saw what I was holding.

‚ÄúOh yeah, I meant to tell you. That piece came in with the order this morning. I thought we weren‚Äôt trying new vendors this quarter?‚Äù the employee said. 

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt order this. Was it on the order form?‚Äù Melissa asked. 

‚ÄúNope, just extra.‚Äù the employee said as he walked through the door. 

The entire time they were talking I was checking out every last detail of this piece. It was made from mostly clear glass with a green stripe down one side of it, following the curves of the glass.The green was lighter, and looked like it might glow in the dark. But the stripe also seemed to sparkle and shimmer in the light. It had a round neck like a normal bong but the bottom was square instead of round. It just seemed different, it even felt different in my hands. I was very excited for a chance to smoke out of it. 

‚ÄúHow much would you sell it for?‚Äù I asked Melissa. 

I was still looking the piece over when I had asked, but when she didn't answer I looked over at her. She was looking at the bong with a curious and confused look on her face. She noticed that I was looking at her and she shook her head like she was trying to shake away a bad thought. 

‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôm not sure. I would have to check with the distribution company to see if they want to come back and pick it up. Maybe it was supposed to go to another local shop.‚Äù Melissa said without taking her eyes off the piece. 

‚ÄúCould you call them right now? I‚Äôm really interested in purchasing this.‚Äù I eagerly asked.
‚ÄúUh, ye-yeah-yeah sure.‚Äù Mellissa stammered. 
She put her arm out towards the bong and I gave it to her. She looked at it for a second and then walked through the door behind the counter.

She was gone for about 15 minutes, I eagerly waited the entire time. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about getting the piece home. 

When Melissa came back through the door she was holding a large box that was taped extremely securely. Like she was afraid that something might try to escape the box. 

‚ÄúSo, the distribution company has no record of something like this coming off the truck, they even said that the driver has been done with his deliveries and nothing was missing from any of the orders. So, I‚Äôm free to do whatever I want with it.‚Äù she said. 

‚ÄúAwesome! I would love to buy it, if you're planning on selling it.‚Äù I said excitedly.
Mellissa ended up selling it to me for $55. I thought it was a steal but she seemed to want to get the bong away from her. As I pulled out of the shop I saw her looking at me through the front windows of the shop. She had a really worried look on her face, and I thought I could see a bit of fear in her eyes. 

I took my new prized piece home and set the scene. I turned on my go to tv show, American Dad, on the flat screen. In front of me was my rolling tray with a bag of Chem Dawg sativa, the grinder, an ashtray and my lighter all neatly placed.

I filled the bong with water and packed the bowl.

The hit felt amazing.

I filled the bottom with smoke and inhaled. As I inhaled I prepared myself for that new bong cough. But the smoke actually felt cold as I inhaled. It completely relaxed my throat and I was able to take the entire hit without coughing. I hadn‚Äôt even had time to put the bong back on the table before the high kicked in. I've been smoking the same weed for a week now and it hadn‚Äôt once hit me like that so I knew that it was the bong. I‚Äôm not sure how it did it but it made the high feel intensified. 

I almost felt like that girl that melted into the couch in that anti-drug commercial in the 90‚Äôs-2000‚Äôs. 

I laid my head back on the couch and closed my eyes, ready to feel this different kind of high, but that's when a vision started to play across my thoughts. 

There I was running down a hallway in an old house. I could see my hands moving at my sides and one hand had a large knife in it. The knife and my hand were covered in blood. These hands though. They weren‚Äôt mine. The hands and arms were hairier and more muscular.

I heard a door slam ahead of me and I looked up, still running down the long hallway. I somehow knew it was the door at the end of the hall that had slammed. I heard a woman screaming, begging me to stop. 

I tried to open my eyes but I couldn‚Äôt. No matter what I did I couldn‚Äôt make the vision stop. I was even pulling at my face but my eyes seemed to be stuck closed. 

The vision kept playing, at this point the vision version of myself was at the door the woman had run through. He was slamming his fists against the door trying to break it down.

Suddenly a large crack appeared in the door. As soon as I saw the crack I felt a sudden rage burn through my physical body. I was so mad that I could feel my body shaking, and all of my muscles tensed. My real life body jumped up and was in a fighting stance ready to take out my rage. I knew that bitch behind that door needed to die.

The man kept pounding on the door and soon broke through. He quickly saw the woman curled up in the corner. She looked horrified, peaking out at the man from behind her hands. She started screaming when the man dropped the knife and suddenly lunged at her. 
I had a front row seat in my mind to watch him beat this woman to a pulp. He didn‚Äôt stop beating her head until he was mashing chunks into the carpet.

As the man was admiring his handy work and trying to catch his breath, he heard a small cry coming from behind him. He looked over his shoulder and saw a little girl in her pjs	 standing in the doorway. She was holding the hand of a younger boy with a binky in his mouth and a teddy bear that he was holding against himself. The boy seemed to not know what was happening. But the girl looked terrified and frozen in place.

The man suddenly lunged at the kids and all of a sudden I woke up.

I looked at my surroundings. I was completely terrified. I was standing in my hallway, the door to my bedroom completely broken down and my arms and hands were bleeding. I quickly ran to the bathroom to wash my wounds. 

As I was washing my arms and hands something made a loud thud behind me. I whipped around expecting to get attacked by the man in my vision. 

All that I saw was my Maine Coon, Parker, he must have hopped from the counter to the floor. He seemed to be looking at me with a confused and scared look on his face. I eased my way over to him, he was hesitant at first but started licking my wounds after a minute of head scratches. 

When Parker seemed to calm down I picked up the pieces of my door, and took the rest of the door off the hinges.

After everything was picked up I went back to my living room. As I entered the room I looked at the bong sitting on the coffee table. 
It changed.

The green stripe running down the side had turned black at the bottom of the bong. I picked up the piece and looked at the part that had turned black, it seemed endless. Like it wasn't just colored glass, like I could almost fall into it.

I brushed my finger over the black and it was so cold that it almost hurt to the touch. The chill surprised me and the bong fell out of my hands. It hit the floor with a loud bang and all of the water spilled out. I picked up the piece, careful not to touch the black part of the stripe again. The bong was fine and didn't even have a scratch on it, even though I had dropped it from a few feet off the ground. 
All I wanted to do was forget about this bong for right now and put it to the side. I knew something was seriously really wrong with this piece. Almost like now that I've smoked out of it, it has a presence now. 

I went to bed, but had horrible nightmares, the vision was playing over and over in my dreams. At the ending of one of the loops I woke up. I shot up and was drenched in sweat. I was trying to catch my breath when I looked up into the doorway.

The man from my vision was standing there. 

He was huge. He was wearing worn down work boots, overalls that needed a good wash, one of the straps was unbuckled and hanging down. He was wearing a red shirt that looked to be covered in sweat and dirt. He was breathing really heavily. His arms were hanging at his sides like he was ready to tackle someone. He was wearing an old truckers hat that was casting a shadow over his eyes but I could see that he was grinding his teeth and every time he breathed out he was spitting through the small gaps in his teeth.

He disappeared 5 seconds after I saw him, but I‚Äôm still terrified.

Now it's the next day and I'm sitting in a coffee shop. I'm afraid to go home. I'm afraid the bong is going to draw me in.

What should I do?

1h8b2du,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartStrategies4U/comments/1h8b2du/food_power_for_healthy_aging/,Food Power for Healthy Aging,"https://preview.redd.it/r5dmqytwga5e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=226f863426d99fe44cf85b6136e35af0e7798715

Aging is inevitable, but how we age is largely influenced by the choices we make every day. Among these choices, the food we consume plays a pivotal role in preserving our health, vitality, and quality of life as we grow older. From nutrient-packed superfoods to simple dietary adjustments, what goes on your plate can make a profound difference in how well you age.

# How Does Food Impact Aging?

Healthy aging isn't about turning back the clock‚Äîit's about feeling stronger, thinking sharper, and staying independent for years to come. [**Nutrition**](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition) is at the heart of this process for several reasons:

* **Cell regeneration:** The nutrients in your food help repair and regenerate cells, keeping your body resilient against the wear and tear of time.
* **Energy production:** A balanced diet ensures your body has the fuel it needs for daily activities, keeping fatigue at bay.
* **Disease prevention:** Proper nutrition can lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other chronic illnesses often associated with aging.
* **Cognitive health:** Certain nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, are linked to better brain function and reduced risk of memory-related conditions.

With a deeper understanding of how food impacts aging, let's dig into which nutrients and dietary habits matter most.

# Essential Nutrients for Healthy Aging

**1. Protein for Muscle and Strength**

Muscle mass naturally declines with age‚Äîa process called sarcopenia. To combat this, protein is a must. It helps rebuild and maintain muscle tissue, keeping your body strong and functional.

**Best Protein Sources:**

* Lean meats (chicken, turkey)
* Fish (salmon, tuna)
* Eggs
* Plant-based options like lentils, chickpeas, tofu, and nuts

*Quick tip*: Spread protein consumption evenly across meals for better absorption and improved muscle maintenance.

# 2. Calcium and Vitamin D for Bone Health

Osteoporosis becomes a common concern among older adults, with brittle bones increasing the risk of fractures. Calcium and vitamin D work together to keep [**bones strong**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/12-ways-what-you-eat-affects-your-health/) and healthy.

**Top Picks:**

* Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese)
* Fortified plant-based milk (almond or soy)
* Leafy greens (kale, spinach)
* Fatty fish (sardines, salmon)

Don‚Äôt forget sunlight‚Äîyour body produces vitamin D when exposed to the sun. Try spending 10‚Äì15 minutes outdoors daily.

**3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Cognitive Health**

Memory loss and cognitive decline don't have to be par for the course with aging. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish and certain plant oils, are known for their brain-protective powers.

**Sources of Omega-3s:**

* Salmon, mackerel, and trout
* Chia seeds and flaxseeds
* Walnuts
* Algae-based supplements (for plant-based diets)

Studies suggest omega-3 fatty acids can also reduce inflammation, which is a significant contributor to chronic illnesses like arthritis and [**heart disease.**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/actionable-steps-to-start-improving-your-heart-health-today/)

# 4. Fiber for Digestive Health

Digestive issues, from bloating to constipation, often come with age. High-fiber foods promote gut health by keeping your digestive system functioning smoothly and effectively.

**Fiber-Rich Foods to Try:**

* Whole grains (quinoa, oats, brown rice)
* Fruits (apples, pears, berries)
* Vegetables (broccoli, carrots, artichokes)
* Legumes (black beans, lentils)

Pair fiber with adequate water intake‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for optimal digestion.

# 5. Antioxidants for Fighting Free Radicals

Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals, unstable molecules that can accelerate aging and lead to chronic diseases. These powerhouses come from brightly colored fruits and vegetables.

**High-Antioxidant Foods:**

* Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries
* Dark chocolate (the higher the cocoa content, the better)
* Green leafy vegetables (spinach, kale)
* Nuts and seeds

Aim to eat the rainbow‚Äîdiverse colors often mean a wider range of antioxidants.

# 6. Hydration for Vital Body Functions

Dehydration can lead to fatigue, confusion, and even urinary tract infections, particularly in older adults. Ensuring consistent [**fluid intake**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/raise-your-glass-of-water-to-good-health/) is vital for keeping the body running smoothly.

**Hydration Tips:**

* Keep a water bottle handy throughout the day.
* Include water-rich foods like cucumbers and watermelon.
* Limit dehydrating drinks such as coffee and alcohol.

Aim for 6 to 8 cups of fluids daily, adjusting for activity levels and climate.

# Building a Diet for Longevity

Now that you know which nutrients matter most, how can you incorporate them into your daily meals? Here's a simple action plan:

**1. Adopt a Mediterranean Diet**

Regarded as one of the healthiest diets, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes whole foods like fish, olive oil, nuts, vegetables, and whole grains. Studies show it can lower the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer's, and even early mortality.

**2. Plan Balanced Plates**

Follow the rule of \`half-plate vegetables, one-quarter lean protein, and one-quarter whole grains\`. This ensures an even distribution of key nutrients.

**3. Snack Smart**

Swap out processed snacks for options like yogurt with berries or nuts with dark chocolate.

**4. Avoid ‚ÄúEmpty Calories‚Äù**

Cut down on sugary treats, sodas, and fried foods. These offer little nutrition and contribute to inflammation and weight gain.

**5. Use Meal Prep to Stay Consistent**

Set aside time each week to portion and prep meals. This helps you stick to your healthy eating plan without feeling overwhelmed.

# Small Changes, Big Results

You don‚Äôt need to change everything at once‚Äîsmall, steady steps can make a big difference in your [**health and well-being**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/healthy-aging-habits-nutrition-exercise-and-mental-wellness-for-vitality/). Try swapping one processed snack for a healthier option or adding an extra serving of veggies to your dinner. Every little change brings you closer to feeling your best!

1h8b24l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h8b24l/how_do_i_go_on/,How do I go on? ,"Hello. This a burner account, I'm ashamed to post on my main. (M28)
Long story short, I met someone earlier this year, Let's call her V (28F), V was in a bad place, mentally and physically. She had just moved to the country alone. I've helped her move house, get her drivers licenses, bank accounts, NI numbers (we are both in the UK), transport to and from work, bought her basic warm clothing (she had nothing), helped her financially, been there for her emotionally, just been basically myself, I'm quite a caring genuine, no bullshit dude. 
V quit her job a few months ago, due to her bosses being perverts and pasing inappropriate comments. She was unemployed, not hearing back from anyone about jobs etc. I sorted a job out for her this week, it's not an amazing job but it will help her with bills and making ends meet. We hung out everyday after work, smoked a joint, had a coffee and chatted. 
A few months back, I confessed that I had feelings for her, which was something I never intended to get..
She was understandably shocked and said ""I thought you were just my friend, I'm not looking to date"" which I accepted, that's a fair answer. Fast forward 2 weeks ago, she starts becoming very vague and delayed in her replies, I asked her what's up, and she said she was busy having coffee with an old friend, I didn't hear from her for a few days which made me really worried, given everything she's going through. The truth came out. It was a coworker she went for coffee with, and didn't get home until 4 am. She said nothing happened and I belived her. 
I picked up a second job this week to cover my Xmas gifts for everyone and to try physically drain me ao i dont think about stuff. I don't have the best paying job at the moment. She had promised to come make me meals for the week so I just heat and eat, saves me cooking at 1 in the morning after a 16 hour day. 
She didn't show up, and cancelled on me. She said she was going for coffee instead. Well, she's now seeing the coworker everyday amd going out for 5 star meals with him. I guess what I had to offer was not enough, was I too broke? Was I too ugly? Was I too nice? 
I have been taken as a fool (I know I'm an idiot). How do I go about dealing with myself? 
I've let her go, accepted that I wasn't good enough, and giving her my everything wasn't enough. I feel like hell, used and abused. 
I already struggle with self esteem, and really hate myself some days. I cant even stand to look at myself in the mirror. How do I move forward? I'd like to explore dating someone, as age is a factor, (the years keep coming and they don't stop coming). What's the best way to go about this? Dating apps don't work for me, I'm not the best looking bloke, losing my hair(thanks genetics),socially awkward and really struggling with my mental health.
Any genuine help greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.

Let me say from the outset that from the first cup of coffee I had a bad feeling about this machine.  Something was just ""off"".

Since 2021, we've needed to service it 4 times.  Sensors, the gear box, a deeply buried valve, etc., etc. have gone bad.  We're considering not repairing it the next time it breaks, which it will.  In total, we've spent about $2500 repairing this $4600 machine.

I hear a lot of great things about Jura, but they don't make built-ins.  While we could make a 24"" cabinet out of the hole, we'd rather not.  Besides, there's the previous owners' matching Miele steam oven collecting dust under it (never use it).  Can anyone, from experience, comment on the reliability of other 24"" built-in brands, or do we scrap this idea and go counter top?

Many thanks!",1,1733517206.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

I receivd a few days ago my Maespresso 58 Pro (with the bike pump) and I enjoy the view of it and discovering it, but... I'm struggling with a issu: just after starting the pressure of 9.4 Bars, the water is passing by the coffee puck really fast (less than a second) and being crazy.

  
As grinder I have a 1Zpresso K-max, grinding for espresso is fine (with several size of particules, to see if it changes something)

I tried with the two screens, the O-ring is in the right place.

I even tried to pre-infuse the coffee bad with two Bars, and even then the water passes within the next second.

Am I missing a step?

Blast is 22oz but feels lighter while the original one is 18oz and feels heavier and durable.   
I like the old charging where it uses USB -C rather than old fashioned charging cable.

1h8aue4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1h8aue4/what_helped_me_achieve_pelvic_floor_relaxation/,What helped me achieve Pelvic floor relaxation,"For the past 18-20 months my pelvic floor has been incredibly tight, causing me many problems in my life, problems that basically changed my view of myself, my relationship to my body, and the world. Ya this sounds a bit dramatic but I just want to suggest that I know how serious and subjectively intense pelvic floor problems can be for someone. Although I have only really seen the general as well as the male side of it, having read of stories about women‚Äôs struggles with this, it‚Äôs clear that there‚Äôs sexual issues that result in both and in some similar but also quite different ways. 

As for the male side of it, I had a condition called hard flaccid and it would sometimes improve and sometimes not. I would notice my pelvic floor being very tight some days or for weeks/months at a time and then randomly I would notice improvement and then once again I would see and feel more pelvic floor strain and it felt like, no matter what I did, such as focus on diet, training, no caffeine, stretching, meditation, hormone control through good habits, reducing cortisol, etc., none of it worked; perhaps momentarily I would get relief, but it would always come back. 

It was like chasing a ghost, without going into too much detail it really fucked me up mentally, like I couldn‚Äôt really be myself. It was constantly on my mind because nothing I was doing was working and because I would sometimes improve and then immediately stop. I went on vacation, for example, and the whole vacation I had normal bowels movements ‚Äî something that would never happen under normal circumstances for me ‚Äî and my pelvic floor was relaxed quite often. I thought maybe I had a cortisol problem, or I was eating different , etc. I could have coffee which I was unable to do before then. After the vacation, I slowly returned to normal pelvic floor tightness. Bad movements, couldn‚Äôt have coffee. I was lost, basically hopeless. 
I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the problem for me for basically 2 years. 




Here‚Äôs what I figured out: 

I realized that my hard flaccid/pelvic floor gets worse when:

- I‚Äôm standing 
- I‚Äôm sitting in certain positions
- I‚Äôm leaning on something with my upperbody
- I‚Äôm working out
- I‚Äôm stressed
- My heart is racing
- Sometimes when I just had a bowel movement
- I smoke weed

It improved when:

- I sat in certain other positions
- I lean on something with my upperbody while standing
- I lay down for a while
- When I stretch in certain positions
- I stood with my hips forward and my hands clasped behind my head
- When I bent over as if to stretch my hamstrings

This is what I had to work with, and after thinking for a few days and doing a lot of research I found that I had something called swayback posture. 

I ONLY HAD TO CHANGE ONE MINOR THING TO IMPROVE EVERYTHING.

I can‚Äôt really believe I‚Äôm saying this, but all I had to do stand up tall, with my chest up, head level and neck more aligned with my spine, my shoulders pulled back as if firmly pushing my chest up and out, with my hands at my side with palms facing in toward my body, toes pointing straight out and assigned with my hips. I stood up liked this, and after moving my hips around enough and feeling my joints somewhat stacked, breathing with my diaphragm and not over straining anything, I vaguely noticed a kind of release and lightness in my pelvic floor. Almost like I wasn‚Äôt even noticing it was there, which is no whole I experience the sensation of relaxing the pelvic floor; it‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs not there, or light, invisible; in others words stress free and not tensed.


So all this to basically say:

I JUST HAD TO FUCKING STAND UP STRAIGHT!?!?

So that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs how I fixed my pelvic floor tightness. I‚Äôve been doing this for almost three weeks and it has fixed me. I no longer have problems (although I still stretch to make sure I have a healthy pelvic floor). It‚Äôs also partly a muscle weakness thing so I‚Äôm more focusing on lower body and back and cores workouts to make things easier on my pelvic floor all around, because it deserves a break for having to basically support my non-stacked upperbody for a couple years.


look up a picture of the natural shape of the spine, it will help you see how you should position your spine when standing; for me it felt awkward at first because it felt like I was hyperextending but no, it just feels weird because I haven‚Äôt really stood normal and tall for a long time. You should feel almost overly confident when standing. 

I felt the changes on the first day standing like this, and after three weeks things are just getting better and better, improving and improving. 

My problem was simply posture, it was the root of all my problems.
 
Please share these ideas with people who might need them if you can. I hope this simple trick can save just one more person from one more day of feeling how I felt for those 2 years. 

(Sorry for the post being so long, I felt the backstory might help someone relate)

Edit:
Reminder to stand up straight, Chest up, shoulder back, relax the belly, relaxed breathing, and feel your back stack onto your hips and relaxing, relieving pressure on your pelvic floor. If there are questions I can address how I stand and how it feels.",1,1733516746.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

1h8asok,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1h8asok/recent_xcaret_mexico_vs_moon_palace_the_grand/,Recent Xcaret Mexico vs Moon Palace the Grand Experience,"**TLDR:** We had a blast at Xcaret Hotel Mexico (XHM), but Moon Palace the Grand (MPG) was a letdown.

**Preface:** Our mid-November vacation was the first all-inclusive resort experience. We had a week to spend, so we decided to check out two resorts, just to see which one we would like for our future trips. We chose based on available deals and reviews. Both Xcaret Mexico and Moon Palace the Grand are very highly rated. We spent 4 nights at XHM and 2 nights at MPG.

So, we embarked on our journey knowing very little what to expect. We arrived at CUN and were accompanied to a nice air-conditioned (:)) Xcaret lodge and were offered drinks while we were waiting for the next bus. From that very first experience, we felt like we were going to enjoy the stay at Xcaret.

Anyway, not to bore you with all minute details, I'll just list positives and negatives for both resorts.

**Xcaret Hotel Mexico Positives**

\- Hotel/resort and room. Absolutely stunning. From the grounds/landscape with lagoons, rivers, caves, hanging bridges between buildings and the chapel to the lighting, the art, staff uniforms, decor, pools, parrots, lizards, and other animals. Everything is so unique and ... curated would be the right word. Almost everything was Xcaret-branded, artsy, and eco-conscious.

\- General atmosphere, ambience, vibe. Music was perfect. It did feel like you are in Mexico/tropics. It felt authentic. Everybody looked laid back and it looked like people were really having a good and relaxing time. We also noticed that the crowd was mostly Spanish-speaking in contrast to MPG and wore nice but more casual clothing. Lighting, torches, fires at night added to the atmosphere.

\- Service. Staff were super courteous and trying to attend to any need you may have. They genuinely looked happy and willing to help without any hint at needing a tip. We tipped plenty, but never felt it was expected and the service was great all the same.

\- Included parks. We loved Xenses, especially the Xensatorium, the Pinwheel, the Eden, the Underground Labyrinth, the water attractions (didn't do the mud thing though), the Bird Flight. El Pueblo is simply magical and trippy. Xplor was also great. The ziplines, the ATVs, Tobaganxote (didn't like the rafts as much). We liked Xel-Ha, too, but not as much as Xenses and Xplor (the mangrove tubing was great though as well as the Mexico buffet with Tamales and pot coffee). Xcaret Park was OK. We liked snorkeling in the grottos and lagoon. But the rest was good, but nothing to write home about. Be prepared to be exhausted in every park though.

\- Restaurants. Mercado was our go to for breakfast. It had almost everything you may want to indulge in. We had dinner at Los Faroles (the lighting show was great, the grilled octopus and guac with crickets and ants, yes, crickets and ants :) was great), Xin Gao (good Asian Fusion food with decent rolls), La Trajinera (great laid back atmosphere by the pool and great seafood), La Playas (the most ""tropical"" of the restaurants).

**Xcaret Hotel Mexico Negatives**

\- Miscellaneous. Nitpicking here, but some park busses could be upgraded as they looked a bit dated. Seaweed smell is present close to the beach. The beach itself is, well, pretty, but is not really something a beach lover would enjoy. Signage may be an issue throughout the hotel (sometimes hard to find your way around).

\- Restaurants. Las Cuevas was the worst experience at the hotel. The caverns are absolutely beautiful, especially at night. But we were seated in an awkward spot and the staff would consistently ignore our table when going around with the meats. The meats were oversalted and overdone. We did not like anything in Las Cuevas and we are not super picky eaters either. We also went to Bio at night. That was a mistake. It was hard to find (the signage issue) and when we got there, it was empty, so we left. We should probably have tried it for breakfast or lunch instead.

\- As we were a family of four, we were not able to explore the Arte side of the property (not really the hotel's fault.)

**Now, onto Moon Palace the Grand Positives**

\- Waterpark. Smallish, but decent. With the Flowrider surfing attraction (long lines though).

\- Restaurants. Habibi restaurant was great (khatchapouri and braised lamb were absolutely delicious). The Boulangeri coffee shop was excellent, too.

\- Arcade. Along with the waterpark, that's about all the entertainment you'll get. They also have a schedule of various shows though (we went to the clown show which we surprisingly liked despite its intended audience being young children, who seem to be having so much fun).

\- Wildlife. There are tons of coatis roaming around (obviously, make sure you don't get bit). The tropical jungle sounds that come from the ponds around the property are also calming.

\- Access to the adjacent Sunrise and Nizuc hotels. We went to Sunrise and liked the live music stage.

**Moon Palace the Grand Negatives**

\- Restaurants. The main buffet was ok, but generic. Los Tacos was also kinda meh. Jade genuinely sucked. Service was good, but the food was atrocious. The sushi/sashimi was of the gas station quality. Didn't try any other restaurants as we didn't stay long enough.

\- Stupid golf cart system of transportation. Just a suggestion - make the hotel walkable and attractive instead of hauling people from one spot to another in a golf cart.

\- Service. Staff were courteous, but did not look like they were genuinely happy to be working there, but instead it felt like they constantly wanted tips and hinted at that at every possibility.

\- General atmosphere, ambience, vibe. This was our main gripe. The hotel felt nothing else but a big and fancy shopping mall with motel-type buildings around it. I felt like I was in a mall somewhere in America. It looked like people dressed to show off and walked around with no purpose. I hardly ever felt like I'm in Mexico. Crowds were predominantly Americans (not a bad thing per se, but people didn't look or behaved like they were really on a tropical vacation). Music. C'mon, if I wanted to listen to American pop or the 80s/90s rock, I would just stay in the U.S. Everything in the room (goodies/snacks/etc.) was also generic.

**Conclusion:** This was our first experience with all-inclusive resorts and we were baffled by how different that experience was in the two places. One was unique and authentic, the other one was generic for the lack of a better word. Had I known that in advance, I would have easily traded the two nights at MPG for one more night at XHM and would have done kayaks on the property (something we missed due to tight schedule). Not really dissing MPG, but it was not for us. On the contrary, Xcaret was great and is now one of our happy places.

Anyway, I hope this helps and I will be happy to answer any questions.",3,1733516613.0,AllInclusiveResorts,3,0.81,False

1h8as13,https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/1h8as13/why_spicy/,Why Spicy? ,"I like spicy food, but I feel spicy sushi masks the flavor of the fish.   My question here is ""why is it so popular for the restaurants?"" 

Recently, I've been to a few places and ordered a Bento lunch or a dinner combo, or just specials that include one or two rolls.  Last night, it was a nigiri assortment with 2 basic rolls, one a spicy tuna roll.  Recently, it was a bento lunch that included a spicy tuna roll.  Both places, I asked if I could just have a regular tuna roll, both said no substitutions.  It's happened to me previously, all different places.

I know that substitutions are problematic for restaurants.  So maybe it's entirely about policy.  But I've begun wondering if there's a cost issue.  Because spicy fish tends to be diced, chopped, sometimes it almost seems ground to paste... is it a way for sushi bars to use up bits, ends, bad slices, etc?   

I looked, they don't charge more for a tuna/salmon/albacore roll compared to spicy tuna/salmon/albacore.  So why are they hesitant to substitute?   And why does it feel like more and more places are promoting rolls with chopped spicy fish?

As i type this, it occurs to me: maybe I'm missing the point.  Maybe many sushi enthusiasts don't love the taste of fish, and prefer it masked by spice.  The same way they love mochas or flavored drinks but not the taste of plain coffee.",7,1733516566.0,sushi,9,0.82,False

TW: Suicide

So, I work as a party princess, and have for five years. It‚Äôs my favorite thing in the world. Unfortunately, the environment my boss creates is often stressful and hateful. I always work through problems and health issues, but I‚Äôve come to a point where I am very sick and want to take care of myself and put my needs first. I am losing a lot of weight without knowing why, my heart is constantly skyrocketing to the point where I see white, I can‚Äôt stop getting sick and losing my voice (it‚Äôs been in and out for 6 weeks) and I‚Äôm just so tired. 

For reference: I do a lot of unpaid work for my boss, on-top of what I was paid to do. I did the scheduling and social media for her for free. I restyled countless wigs for free, which is about a 1-3 hour processes depending on how bad. I bought supplies with my own money due to broken or missing pieces. Bought cards and gifts for parties where they were needed, but neglected.  She could call me for a last minute party and I would be there within the hour. (And I have). I also take on a lot of the really ‚Äúcrappy‚Äù shifts nobody wants (mascots for 3+ hours in the summertime)

But she is so cruel sometimes and does some horrible things. She constantly makes fun of our other coworkers looks and their weights. She had made fun of me for how I look without makeup on, and referred to a coworker of mine as ‚Äúsimply enormous‚Äù. She also named a pigeon in her barn after a coworker and shot it in front of. She said that another coworker was dumb as a rock, and would only peak in college as a sorority girl, and then have to marry rich since she is so useless.

She also has done some very questionable things. She has talked about how much she wants to sleep with certain employees (in her 40s, married with kids). She put a 15 year old into a tight corset for a public event simply because her son was attending and wanted him to be able to ogle her. 

So long story short, it‚Äôs odd. 

Well, I quit yesterday. And my boss threatened to kill herself. 

I told her I would fufill all of my scheduled shifts and then I would be taking a step back.I told her my last day would be the 15th of December, as that was my last shift I was scheduled down for. She then proceeded to tell me she had to refund 5 events and decline 10 gigs because of me leaving and it was all my fault. (over the course of the 12 hours from the time I put my notice in, to this interaction) 

 I was honest and said that it wasn‚Äôt good for my physical and mental health. I said that I keep losing weight because I‚Äôm not eating, I‚Äôm having severe heart problems and am always on the brink of passing out. She responded with that she has lost weight too and isn‚Äôt well and that it‚Äôs not an excuse. 

She then went off about how I had told her over the phone I was leaving and not in person. The thing is, I was going to. I asked her to meet for coffee to talk about some things and she said that if there is something I needed to say, to say it then over the phone. I tried a few more times to persuade her and she kept saying no, so then I told her. And she lost it.

I also told her that I hate how she talks about her employees behind their backs all the time to everyone. And she said that she swears on her children‚Äôs life that she would never. But you can ask anyone in the company and they will tell you how horrible cruel she is with her words about others. (She once pulled up a picture of an applicant at an event we were working and made fun of her in front of us, calling her ‚Äúbuck toothed and ugly‚Äù) 

Then she said I‚Äôve made her suicidal and she can‚Äôt believe I would do this right before Christmas. 

She also yanked me from all remaining shifts, saying I didn‚Äôt deserve them, only to have her husband call a few minutes later and ask for me to do them because they are so tight on staff.

I was only planning and stepping away for a few months, but it‚Äôs permanent now. 

Is this behavior toxic? Did I make a good choice? I feel like I‚Äôm over reacting sometimes, but then other, I feel so hurt.",1,1733516075.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

The way it happened was that we were all working late on Friday.

So this common friend proposes to my crush that the two of them can go to a coffee shop and sit and work. 

My crush agrees but says she won't go to a Cafe to chill, she will only go to work.

So, when my crush was packing up and leaving, my crush, I asked her if she was leaving. She said she was going to a cafe to work with that common friend.

At that time, the common friend asked me to come along as well. I said I don't mind as I like coffee (that's  true). Anyway, my crush was a bit uncomfortable at that.

When we finally went to the Cafe and got our drinks, she called one of her girl friends, who was out with her boyfriend for dinner nearby, and said once they're done with dinner she will meet them. During the call she said her life is sad and after the call, she said ""all my friends are having fun"".

At this time I asked her - ""What's holding you back? (from fun)"".

She said - ""Not having a boyfriend!""  Then she changed the topic and said it's because she has too much work.

I don't know how to analyze this. I wonder if she has FOMO about relationship and is receptive to me making a move on her.",1,1733516040.0,dating_advice,2,0.6,False

My husband and I just moved to Lawn Oak last month from the west coast and we are trying to become more familiar with the area. 

Does anyone have any recs for the best sushi, Mexican restaurants, or date night spots here in Oak Lawn? We prefer smaller locally owned business over large chains, and would love know what places to try first. 

Also, if you have any recommendations for coffee/tea shops to hang out/work from, that would be amazing! We had a ton of places like that where we lived prior but we haven‚Äôt had much luck finding anything that close by us so far.

1h8aiez,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditknowsbest1/comments/1h8aiez/best_electric_kettle/,Best Electric Kettle ,"As someone who's gone from casual tea drinker to full-blown coffee and tea enthusiast, I've learned that having the right electric kettle makes a huge difference in your daily brewing ritual. After testing these kettles in my own kitchen (and making countless cups of pour-over coffee and tea), here's my honest take on three standout options:

[Amazon Basics Electric Kettle ](https://geni.us/fAeZrv)

Perfect for no-fuss boiling! This budget-friendly kettle has become my reliable morning companion. It boils water quickly, shuts off automatically, and has a generous 1-liter capacity. While it's basic, it gets the job done without any bells and whistles. I especially love the wide opening for easy cleaning.

[Govee Gooseneck Electric Kettle](https://geni.us/rDjymq5)

This is my go-to for pour-over coffee. The precision gooseneck spout gives amazing control over water flow, and the temperature control is spot-on for different tea types. The sleek stainless steel design looks great on my counter, and the hold temperature feature keeps water ready for my second (okay, sometimes third) cup.

[Wolf Gourmet Precision Electric Kettle](https://geni.us/3MrkPrM)

This is definitely the luxury pick, but wow, what a kettle! The temperature accuracy is incredible for specialty teas, and the build quality is outstanding. The keep-warm function actually maintains the exact temperature you want. Yes, it's pricey, but if you're serious about your tea or coffee, it's worth considering.

Pro tip: Whichever kettle you choose, always empty and dry it after use ‚Äì it'll last so much longer!",1,1733515859.0,redditknowsbest1,0,1.0,False
