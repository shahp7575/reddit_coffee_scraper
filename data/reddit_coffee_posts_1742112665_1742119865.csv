1jci5xb,https://i.redd.it/xyaccbrpy0pe1.jpeg,Teeth mobility after braces (no retainer),"
Hello! I just want to get some insights regarding my situation.

I attached here my latest Xray and I know that the bone loss is visible. 

- I‚Äôm still on braces for 2 years already but the bottom ones were removed last October 2024 since I have wiggly tooth and its kind of alarming as per my dentist. She told me to ‚Äúlet it rest first and observe in the next months‚Äù

- Currently, they‚Äôre still wiggly but not visible when I have to check it using my tongue, I have to use my fingers to check for the mobility. And I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm doing this everyday just to check the movement. 

- as per my dr., I should keep it clean to prevent further gum recession (But one of my teeth already have severe gum recession -4th teeth from the left based on the pic I attached) 

- this is my routine to keep it clean‚Ä¶.and if there‚Äôs anyone who have the same situation, please please let me know what else should I do üòî

*no coffee since mid Feb - just to reduce acid 
*mild consumption of soda
*Orahex in the morning (5ml - 30 seconds swish) and before going to sleep
*twice floss - after lunch and dinner 
*twice brush - after lunch and dinner 
*supplements I‚Äôm taking - caltrate, sensedol + milk for calcium 
*I also using interdental toothbrush to clean the middle
*using sensedol gum care since there are times that my teeth are sensitive
*last cleaning was Feb 2025 and will comeback on May for another cleaning (advised to have cleaning every 3 months)

^the numbers you see in the pic is the grade/level of teeth mobility accdg to my dentist. 


Now my questions are:

1. Is there a way to reduce the mobility or better, reverse the strength of my teeth? 
2. Will I lose my teeth in the next months? üòü
3. And if may same case as mine, please please let me know what did you do. 



Thank you so much!

I‚Äôm considering moving to a rooftop one room near Guro Digital Complex Station in Seoul. The place is spacious, has a detached kitchen, private rooftop access (lots of sunlight!), and seems pretty quiet. The walk to Guro Digital Complex Station is about 9 minutes at a brisk pace, and the rent is around 800k/month with a 10M KRW deposit. This seems like a great deal but it's in Guro, which idk if that is the catch?


Here are my main questions:

1.	I‚Äôm looking for places to take dance classes, yoga, cosplay, board games, music/art classes, etc. I‚Äôm also interested in tech startup communities and video game developing. How accessible are these things around Guro, or will I regularly need to commute elsewhere (like Mapo or Gangnam)?

- Im a 27 yo male with a youthful vibe and charm! I prefer to hang around people between 20-30.

2. This place is a rooftop apartment (Ïò•ÌÉëÎ∞©). Does anyone have experience living in rooftop units, especially regarding temperature control (summer heat, winter cold)? Any tips for making rooftop living comfortable?

3. How do residents feel about the area overall? Is it friendly, convenient, and safe? Any hidden gems or local recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Lastly, if anyone here lives around Guro and wants to grab coffee sometime, let me know. I‚Äôd love to meet some friendly faces nearby!

1jchxmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AxiomTradingCommunity/comments/1jchxmz/axiomtrade_the_defi_playground_where_crypto/,Axiom.Trade: The DeFi Playground Where Crypto Newbies and Pros Actually Get Along,"# DeFi: The Wild West of Finance (But with Fewer Tumbleweeds)

Picture this: You‚Äôre standing in front of a vending machine labeled ‚ÄúDecentralized Finance.‚Äù You‚Äôve heard it dispenses life-changing opportunities, but instead of buttons, it‚Äôs covered in terms like ‚Äúliquidity mining,‚Äù ‚ÄúAPY,‚Äù and ‚Äúzk-rollups.‚Äù You press one, and out drops‚Ä¶ a cryptic error message and a $50 gas fee receipt.

This, my friends, is why I used to think DeFi was designed exclusively for robots and MIT grads. But then I stumbled on [**Axiom.Trade**](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom), a platform that feels less like a lecture on quantum physics and more like a friendly tour guide through the crypto jungle. Let‚Äôs break down why it‚Äôs become my go-to for DeFi adventures (and why even my skeptical cousin Dave finally stopped eye-rolling).

# Axiom.Trade: Where User-Friendly Meets ‚ÄúWait, This Is Actually Fun?‚Äù

1. **The Interface That Doesn‚Äôt Require a Manual** Most DeFi platforms look like they were designed by someone who‚Äôs never met a human. [Axiom.Trade](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom), though? It‚Äôs all clean buttons, intuitive menus, and zero hieroglyphics. Even my mom‚Äîwho still calls NFTs ‚Äúthose digital Pok√©mon things‚Äù‚Äîcould swap tokens here without accidentally summoning a liquidity pool demon.
2. **Security That Feels Like a Trusty Guard Dog (Not a Sleepy One)** [Axiom.Trade](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom) uses audited smart contracts and lets you keep full control of your crypto. Translation: Your funds aren‚Äôt locked in a basement guarded by a guy named ‚ÄúCryptoKeith.‚Äù You hold the keys, and the platform‚Äôs security features are like a loyal German Shepherd‚Äîalways alert, never overbearing.
3. **Cross-Chain Magic: Because Monogamy Is Overrated** Ethereum? Binance Smart Chain? Polygon? [Axiom.Trade](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom) doesn‚Äôt make you choose. It‚Äôs the Switzerland of DeFi: neutral, efficient, and fluent in every blockchain dialect. Need to move funds from one chain to another? It‚Äôs as seamless as switching Netflix profiles.
4. **Gas Fees That Won‚Äôt Make You Sell a Kidney** Let‚Äôs be honest: Ethereum gas fees have turned us all into part-time accountants. [Axiom.Trade](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom) optimizes transactions to keep costs lower than my motivation on a Monday morning. Finally, a platform that understands *not* everyone wants to spend 100moving100moving20.

# ‚ÄúBut Seriously‚Ä¶ What Can I Do Here?‚Äù

* **Yield Farming for the Lazy Genius:** Set up automated strategies and let your crypto work while you nap. It‚Äôs like hiring a tiny robot farmer to tend your digital crops.
* **Swapping Tokens Without the Drama:** Trade faster than you can say ‚ÄúFOMO,‚Äù with minimal slippage and no existential crises.
* **Staking for Snacks (Or Passive Income):** Park your crypto in a staking pool and earn rewards. Think of it as a savings account, but with better memes.

# The Secret Sauce: Axiom.Trade‚Äôs Vibe Check

What really sets this platform apart? It feels like it was built by actual humans who‚Äôve suffered through DeFi growing pains. For example:

* **No Jargon Overload:** Descriptions are written in *English*, not ‚ÄúCrypto-Babble 101.‚Äù
* **Guided Tutorials:** They hold your hand (gently) through your first liquidity pool.
* **Community Focus:** Their Telegram and Discord are full of helpful folks, not just moon-shot spammers.

# How to Dive In Without Face-Planting

1. **Wallet First, Panic Later** Grab MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or whatever floats your crypto boat. Connect it to Axiom.Trade‚Äîno KYC, no invasive questions about your childhood pet‚Äôs name.
2. **Start with a ‚ÄúCrypto Snack‚Äù** Dip your toes in with a small swap or a mini liquidity pool. Pro tip: Treat your first transaction like a first date‚Äîlow stakes, no regrets.
3. **Follow the Breadcrumbs** Join their [Telegram](https://t.me/axiomofficial) for updates, or stalk their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/axiomtrade) for memes and alpha. Yes, ‚Äúalpha‚Äù is crypto-speak for ‚Äúuseful info,‚Äù not a fraternity thing.

**Fun Fact:** I‚Äôve been tinkering with [Axiom.Trade](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom) myself lately, and you can check out my journey [**right here**](https://axiom.trade/@graham23s). *Full transparency: That link might give me a virtual high-five (aka referral credit) if you join, but it won‚Äôt cost you a penny. Thanks for fueling my coffee addiction while I write these guides!*

# Why This Isn‚Äôt Just Hype (and What Could Be Better)

No platform is perfect‚ÄîAxiom.Trade‚Äôs token selection isn‚Äôt endless, and new features roll out slower than my grandma‚Äôs dial-up internet. But for a stress-free DeFi experience? It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air in a space that often feels like a gas leak.

# The Bigger Picture: DeFi for the Rest of Us

The future of finance shouldn‚Äôt require a PhD or a trust fund. [Axiom.Trade](http://Axiom.Trade) proves that DeFi can be both powerful *and* approachable‚Äîlike a Tesla with training wheels. Whether you‚Äôre here to farm yield, trade tokens, or just satisfy your crypto curiosity, platforms like this are paving the way for the *actual* mass adoption we keep hearing about.

# Final Thoughts: Your Turn to Explore!

Look, I‚Äôm not saying [Axiom.Trade](http://Axiom.Trade) will turn you into the next crypto billionaire. But if you‚Äôre tired of DeFi platforms that feel like SAT prep exams, this might just be your jam. It‚Äôs the closest thing to a ‚Äúno-judgment zone‚Äù in crypto‚Äîperfect for newbies, pros, and anyone who‚Äôs ever cried over a gas fee.

*Ready to give it a whirl? You can start poking around* [*Axiom.Trade*](http://Axiom.Trade) [**here**](https://axiom.trade/@graham23s) *and see what the fuss is about. And hey, if you end up loving it, spread the word‚Äîyour crypto-skeptic friends might finally stop mocking you.*",1,1742118118.0,AxiomTradingCommunity,0,1.0,False

I think burned out na ako sa work. I can't resign since I'm breadwinner. I can feel na may effect na siya sa performance ko. Most of the time, tinatamad ako. Last time I felt this was years ago. I dread mondays kasi papasok nanaman sa work. I want to turn this around, if overnight kaya much better.

Context\*\*:\*\*

I feel dread and sadness kapag pa-Sunday night na. Ayoko na mag-lunes. When I am at work, feeling ko ang bagal na ng work ko, walang direction and parang wala nako sa mood. I'm a programmer by trade and sadly, mid-shift yung schedule ko (Prefer ko is 8-5 talaga). The past few weeks, parating OT and for the past 3 years, parang parating may issue sa project, rush lahat. Ang break ko lang sa work is literally lunch saka dinner. I can see other people from other teams na nakakapag-coffee break, kwentuhan sa pantry, etc. Pero ako, either lunch/dinner or glued to the monitor kasi parang parating madaming kelangan gawin.

I feel drained. And nakakainis pa yung palipat-lipat ng task. One time I am doing my normal assigned task, tapos may mag-chat, sira daw yung X, Y, Z - blocked sila, so lilipat ako dun, then babalik sa task ko. Tapos aasignan ka ng new tech na wala kang kaalam alam, pero rush daw yung deadline.

I honestly miss yung dating work ko. There are times na nasa SB kami for like 30mins, minsan 1hr pa. Di siya petiks, pero di madalas yung rushness ng tasks. And you focus on one task at a time.

Nakakapagod. Tapos may admin tasks pa outside ng client work.

Gusto ko na sabihin sa manager ko minsan na leave me alone sa client work, syempre di naman pwede.

And honestly, di lang ako nakakaramdam nito sa team, parang lahat ata kami. Mas mabigat lang sa akin kasi nasa senior level na.

Di ko naman afford magresign kasi honestly, the pay is good, breadwinner ako.

Pero I don't feel rested na ng weekends kahit wala akong ginagawa. I feel random chest pains na din probably due to stress.

For people out there na hindi niyo passion ang work and nasa medyo higher level na kayo, how do you deal with these?

For Filipino devs na di din nila passion ang work, how are you po?

For managers - anong tips din?

Previous Attempts:

Na raise ko na to a couple of times, pero feeling ko wala naman improvement. Iniisip ko na din na buti nga ako may work na good pay. I'm trying to be thankful sa meron ako now, pero pagod and stress pa din nangingibabaw. I am taking sick days literally once a month na din.",1,1742117141.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

Suddenly she‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBusiness Astrologer‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpiritual Entrepreneur‚Äù? Oh, please. We‚Äôve seen this play out before: once the old hustle starts getting too much heat, slap on a new label and hope everyone forgets the past.

Remember when she was peddling her ‚Äúmagic‚Äù lip tints and skincare? Because, you know, ‚Äúesoteric cosmetics‚Äù are apparently a thing now. Never mind the complete lack of any legitimate scientific backing. If you questioned her, you were basically told you ‚Äújust don‚Äôt understand the deeper truths.‚Äù Sure, Jan.

The biggest red flag? Everything about her brand screams money grab. From sky-high readings to pseudo-spiritual products, she‚Äôs always known how to milk the gullible. And guess what? Now she‚Äôs targeting businesses‚Äîbigger wallets, bigger paydays.

Some highlights from her meltdown:

	1.	Claiming she‚Äôs been ‚Äúpunished by karma‚Äù for going against the universe. Because apparently, karma only shows up when the audience starts to catch on.

	2.	Insisting she‚Äôs ‚Äúlearned her lesson‚Äù and that this new direction is pure. Right. We‚Äôve heard this same song and dance from countless scammers before.

	3.	Hyping up her ‚Äúnew era‚Äù of spiritual entrepreneurship, which is basically code for ‚ÄúI can charge even more if I slap the word ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô on it.‚Äù

It‚Äôs comical how she thinks a single social media post can erase her track record of fear-mongering and overcharging. If people want to believe her, that‚Äôs on them. But personally, I can‚Äôt help but laugh at the audacity.

Bottom line: A new coat of paint on a busted car doesn‚Äôt fix the engine. She can rename herself, restructure her ‚Äúofferings,‚Äù and even rewrite her entire ‚Äúspiritual journey,‚Äù but it‚Äôs still the same hustle at its core.

I attached here my latest Xray and I know na mababa na nga yung bone level. So a little background: 

- I‚Äôm still on braces for 2 years na pero tinanggal na ng dentist ko yung nasa bottom last October 2024 kasi mejo magalaw yung mga teeth ko. As per my dr., ‚Äúpagpahingahin‚Äù muna daw yung mga ngipin ko and observe in the next months. 

- Currently, magalaw pa din sila pero not visible yung movement if tongue yung gamit ko pang check. I have to use my fingers to check for the mobility. And I‚Äôm doing this everyday kasi nga natatakot ako üòï so I keep on wiggling my tooth everyday just to check. 

- as per my dr., keep it clean daw para di na bumaba yung gums ko, since may naging partial gum recession din ako sa isang teeth ko. 

- this is my routine to keep it clean‚Ä¶.kung meron po sainyong same case sakin, please please let me know what else should I do üòî

*no coffee since mid Feb since nababasa ko na malaki din effect nya sa acid na nakakasira ng ngipin
*super dalang na din mag softdrinks to take care of my teeth na din 
*Orahex agad pagkagising (5ml - 30 seconds swish) and also bago mag sleep
*twice mag floss - after lunch and dinner 
*twice brush - after lunch and dinner 
*supplements I‚Äôm taking - caltrate, sensedol + milk for calcium 
*I also use interdental toothbrush sa pagitan ng mga teeth na yan to clean. 
*using sensedol gum care since may ngilo din sha minsan 
*last cleaning was Feb 2025 and will comeback on May for another cleaning kasi sabi mas okay daw if every 3 months ang cleaning

^the numbers you see in the pic is the grade/level of teeth mobility accdg to my dentist. 


Now ang question ko is:

1. May way pa ba to save my tooth? Kasi ayaw ko naman mabungi pa :( 
2. Tingin nyo ilang years ko pa ma keep yung teeth ko if ganito? :( 
3. And if may same case as mine, please please let me know what did you do.

That song anomaly does not give a rat's ass that I have visual processing issues that prevent me from doing most of the high level present charts, nor the fact that the top line taps are a fucking nightmare to visually differentiate for me. It has been mercilessly beating me in the back of a sketchy Mcdonald's parking lot with a stick covered in every possible painful thing a stick could be adorned with.

This anomaly has already stripped me of my pride, dignity and hope more than enough, i don't want to give it the satisfaction of draining that last sliver by at least not asking if it's:

I could be exhausted and still struggle to fall asleep. Even when I did sleep, I‚Äôd wake up multiple times during the night and feel completely drained in the morning. Melatonin pills sometimes helped, but they often left me groggy the next day.

I came across **Wellamoon sleep patches** while looking for alternatives and was curious. Instead of taking a pill, this **transdermal patch** releases ingredients gradually through the skin. It seemed like a different approach, so I decided to try it for 30 days.

This is my experience‚Äîboth the good and the bad.

# How Wellamoon Sleep Patches Work

Unlike melatonin pills or gummies that deliver a quick dose, the **Wellamoon sleeping patch** releases ingredients over several hours. This avoids the sudden spike and crash that sometimes happens with oral sleep aids.

Each **Wellamoon sleep patch** contains:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** ‚Äì Helps regulate sleep cycles.
* **Valerian Root (27mg)** ‚Äì Often used for relaxation and stress relief.
* **Hops (16.53mg)** ‚Äì Known for its calming effects.
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)** ‚Äì Helps with muscle relaxation and deep sleep.

To use it, you **apply the patch to a clean, hairless area like the forearm, shoulder, or thigh** about an hour before bed. It stays on overnight and is removed in the morning.

More details on the product: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# First Week ‚Äì Adjusting to the Patch

On the first night, I didn‚Äôt notice anything right away. About 20-30 minutes after applying the **Wellamoon sleep patch**, I felt more relaxed, but not in a drowsy way. It was more like a slow wave of calm.

I fell asleep **about 15-20 minutes faster than usual**, which was a good sign. More importantly, I didn‚Äôt wake up as much during the night. By the morning, I felt **more rested than usual**, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just placebo.

By the end of the first week:

* Falling asleep was **easier and faster**.
* Waking up in the middle of the night **happened less often**.
* No grogginess in the morning, unlike melatonin pills.

# Weeks 2-3 ‚Äì Consistent Results

After two weeks, I started noticing a pattern. The nights I used **Wellamoon sleep patches**, my sleep was more **consistent**. I still woke up occasionally, but I **fell back asleep much faster**.

By week three, I also noticed I had **more energy during the day**. I didn‚Äôt rely on multiple cups of coffee to function, and my focus improved.

A few things stood out:

* Sleep felt **deeper and more restful**.
* Waking up at the **same time each morning** felt more natural.
* On nights I skipped the patch, I could still fall asleep fairly easily.

# Week 4 ‚Äì Final Thoughts

After a full month, I didn‚Äôt feel the need to use **Wellamoon sleeping patches** every night anymore. My **sleep schedule had improved**, and my body seemed to adjust.

Some nights, I still woke up once or twice, but I was able to **fall back asleep quickly**. That was a big difference from before, when I‚Äôd wake up and be stuck staring at the ceiling for hours.

If you‚Äôre considering it, you can find more details here: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?uid=34563&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# What to Expect

**Wellamoon sleep patches** won‚Äôt knock you out instantly. They work **gradually** and seem to support a more **natural sleep cycle**.

Some things to keep in mind:

* They **aren‚Äôt a cure for severe insomnia**, but they help with light-to-moderate sleep issues.
* It took about **a week** before I noticed real changes.
* If applied to the **same spot too often**, the adhesive can cause mild skin irritation. Rotating application areas helps.

# Are Wellamoon Sleep Patches Worth It?

For me, **they helped improve my sleep quality over time**. It wasn‚Äôt a dramatic overnight change, but after a month, my **sleep was more consistent, deeper, and less interrupted**.

They might be worth trying if:

* You **struggle to fall asleep** but don‚Äôt want to take pills.
* You **wake up frequently** during the night.
* You want **something that works gradually** without sudden drowsiness.

If you have **severe sleep issues**, these might not be a complete solution, but for mild-to-moderate sleep problems, they‚Äôre worth considering.

New years eve 2023 I made a decision to quit. I was out watching the fireworks and downed half a bottle of brandy to ‚Äùsolidify‚Äù the decision‚Ä¶ oh boy

It took a couple of months to get to a Day 1 but it was exactly like this day. Saturday night that managed to stay sober and wake up to Sunday so fresh and so clean. The high was life changing. 

That Sunday I decided to quit coffee as well and started drinking tea instead - now I brew two glass jars of lemonized ice-tea from a wide selection of black, green, mate, rooibos, herbal

That Sunday I restarted my old yoga-routine that had been on a long break for at least a decade (kids, marriage, work etc excuses)
Now I go through 1-2h yoga-excersize-meditation-y-choung-tai-chi combo almost every day. I have lost some weight. Motivation and focus are better, I feel like a champ as I used to feel like a chump. 

I used the ‚Äùpink cloud energy‚Äù to the fullest and got a handfull of projects going on. Still going on. 
I started eating healthier and more veggie/vegan diet. Not completely cause my kid (6yo) still wants her hot digs and meat balls and so on. 
And I still destroy chips and candy like my life depended on them. I try to get out more and make it count. 

Last spring will definitely be the turning point in my life, and it‚Äôs about f**ing time too. I‚Äôm turning 46 on May. 

I learned so much about myself during the first months. I relapsed a few times in the autumn, a fall fell if you please. And I learned so much more collecting my soul from the floor recovering from the resulting mental relapse. It made me stronger and more willing to push through. 

All very well, couldn‚Äôt be prouder, and being proud of myself is not a common thing. I‚Äôm GenX and ignored and forgotten by parents and society for decades. I‚Äôd say any warm feelings about myself, are luke warm at best and still artificial. 
But I do feel good. Really good. Better than ever even, since I started drinking at 13 or 14 (wtf)

I had a sober year on 2015-16 in hind sight I should‚Äôve stayed on the wagon then. 
2019 a divorce I didn‚Äôt want was the final straw. 2020-2024 I downed a bottle of whiskey/vodka/brandy every single day. 
Beer I quit somewhere around 2021/22 cause it just didn‚Äôt do it for me, only got me bloated and fat. 
I never went to a doctor. I never went to AA. 
I didn‚Äôt seek any help from anyone. My family pretty much left me alone after hearing I don‚Äôt drink - I used to be a reliant drinking buddy for them. 

But you wanna know what happened on that Saturday last year, before my Day 1?

I found r/stopdrinking by accident



I should end it there for dramatic reasons but I still want to thank everyone on this sub and couple of other subs as well, for the billionth time. Thank You for saving my life. I will and I have been trying to return the favor. After all, this is just Year 1

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 40, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world‚Äîjust have an open mind! If you like what I wrote, drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship‚Äîjust harmless fun!

Using a recent 4 week trip to Greece last year as a guide, we'd like to see the countryside more so than the major tourist attactions, although we'll obviously see some of those also. We're interested in the people, the culture, the food, stopping at the quiet cafe on the corner for a coffee etc. We don't speak Italian but will try learn some of the basics. We're not interested in shopping or fashion or insta-famous things.

At this stage we think we'll fly in to Venice in June for 2/3 days, train to Lake Como for  2/3 days, train to Florence via Bolognia and hire a car there to do day trips around the Tuscany area (open to drive suggestions). From there we'll train down to Naples and spend 3/4 days there Sorrento/Amalfi area (open to suggestions). I have friends of Sicilian heritage so would like to spend a few days there looking around (suggestions welcome).

From Sicily we'll head north up the east coast, stopping at Bari, Ancona, then 3/4 days in Rome before flying out.

We don't even know if we can train the route I've suggested, it's just our idea of covering some area, and seeing the countryside, without having the stress of parking, driving etc.

We'll be there June/July 2026.

We're Australian, of Greek heritage, I think we'll manage the social ettiquete reasonably well, being mediterranian heritage ourselves, how will much will speaking English limit us?

Okay, so my 10 month old springer spaniel puppy (Buffy)  has shown signs of reactivity since she was 5 months old. It has been very hard, this is not what I thought having a dog would be like. 
I believe it is fear based, she barks, growls and lunges at other dogs. More so on the lead.
Now here's the strange thing, she is MUCH more reactive on the streets near where I live. I can take her to coffee shops, beaches and parks. Sometimes her heckles will go up and she will grumble a little but other than that she is so much more manageable.

Since she was a 9 week old puppy I have brought her into work with me where there are sometimes other regular dogs (no more than 5), and she is friendly and happy with these dogs. I always watch their intertactions closely. One of them is her litter mate who belongs to my brother (George), one of them is my parents springer, (Peanut).

A few weeks ago we looked after my parents springer whilst they were on holiday and we noticed a huge reduction in her reactivity whilst we were on walks around our house and she was not reactive at all when we went further afield together.

Since Peanut has gone back home her reactivity has gone back to normal near our house (sigh). But she is much much better on walks further afield, especially if we have been there with a friendly dog before.

The only things that contradicts my theory is that at work, there are private fields where I walk the dogs as a group together and if she sees another dog through the fence she will react to it (she has very strong recall so I am comfortable with her off lead, thank god). Also, when I take her into our local pets supplies shop or vets she will wait with me very politely and will barely react to other dogs - and she's not with any friendly dogs there.

Any advice would be really appreciated, I'm not really sure where to go from here. Overall Buffy seems very unbalanced despite me trying my hardest with socialisation at the start. I don't know what to do.",1,1742113870.0,reactivedogs,0,1.0,False
