Market analysis shows growing demand for 0.75 carat natural diamonds in fine jewelry collections, while engagement ring buyers increasingly favor larger lab-grown alternatives ‚Äì reflecting a clear segment shift in how consumers approach different diamond purchases.

When well-cut, a 0.75-carat diamond captures 90% of a one-carat diamond's visual presence, particularly in enhanced settings like halos or cathedral styles. Recent data indicates that three-quarter carat diamonds offer great¬† balance of size and value in the current market.

This guide provides specific strategies for selecting a three-quarter carat diamond that maximizes visual impact while maintaining significant cost savings compared to 1.00 carat alternatives.



# Bottom Line

A three-quarter carat diamond (0.70-0.79 carats) offers an excellent balance of size, quality, and affordability. Here's what you need to know:

* Appears nearly as large as a one-carat diamond when well-cut
* Prices range from $700 to $5,000, depending on quality
* Consider diamonds just below popular carat weights (like 0.79 ct instead of 0.80 ct) for potential savings. This tip is relevant specifically for natural diamonds.
* Compatible with various setting styles, enhancing versatility
* Three-quarter carat diamonds are ideal for buyers seeking a substantial-looking diamond without the one-carat price tag, allowing for investment in higher quality cut, color, and clarity.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

1gr1iau,https://www.reddit.com/r/moomoo_official/comments/1gr1iau/breaking_down_earnings_reports_for_beginners_part/,Breaking Down Earnings Reports for Beginners (Part 3): How to Understand a Cash Flow Statement,"In [Part ](https://www.reddit.com/r/moomoo_official/comments/1gcmhk3/breaking_down_earnings_reports_for_beginners_part/)2, we discussed how you can fully understand an **Income Statement** and how you can use this to help you gauge financial performance and make more informed investment decisions.

In this final part, we‚Äôll continue building a financial understanding by exploring the cash flow statement, which provides insight into a company‚Äôs cash inflows and outflows.When you're thinking about investing in a company, checking out its **cash flow** is like taking its pulse. Cash flow basically tells you how much actual cash is moving in and out of the business. And, just like with a human, if that flow stops or slows down too much, there could be trouble ahead.

# What‚Äôs a Cash Flow Statement?

A cash flow statement is one of the main financial documents companies produce. It‚Äôs a record of every dollar that came in and went out over a set time period. Think of it as a ‚Äúmoney-in, money-out‚Äù tracker.Imagine it‚Äôs like a swimming pool:

Cash inflow (money coming in) is like pouring water into the pool.

* **Cash outflow** (money going out) is like draining water out of it.

If more water‚Äôs coming in than going out, the pool level rises‚Äîthat‚Äôs **positive cash flow**. If more is draining than coming in, the pool level falls, showing **negative cash flow**.

# The 3 Sections of a Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement is split into three main parts, each showing where the money comes from and where it goes.

**1. Operating Activities**  This is all the cash a company brings in from its main business, like selling coffee if it's a coffee shop.

https://preview.redd.it/f53cxguwau0e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc7de8e89c7a95d2e92d34a475f7561478888d27

* **Positive operating cash flow** means they‚Äôre making cash from their core business.
* **Negative operating cash flow** could mean they‚Äôre spending more than they make.



**2. Investing Activities**  This section covers spending on things like equipment, assets, or other companies. If a company‚Äôs growing, it‚Äôs often spending here, so **negative cash flow in investing activities** can be good because it shows they‚Äôre investing in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/nqtfx78yau0e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cb4be899c87d20d9caefcb87c1843b352da387f

**3. Financing Activities**  This includes cash from loans, issuing stocks, or paying out dividends. For example, borrowing money adds cash here, while paying off debt or giving dividends takes cash out

# Free Cash Flow (FCF): What Is It, and Why Does It Matter?

**Free cash flow** (or FCF) is the amount left after a company has paid its operating expenses and any big investments, like new buildings or equipment. Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos even said, **""Measure your company by your free cash flow.""** Here‚Äôs why investors love it:

* **Positive FCF** = cash left over to grow the business, pay dividends, or reduce debt.
* **Negative FCF** = the company might need more financing to cover costs.

# Why Investors Like Cash Flow Over Profit

Cash flow is tough to fake. Unlike profit, which can include ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù money (like sales on credit), cash flow deals only with cash that‚Äôs actually in hand. If a company says they made $100, but only $20 is cash and the rest is credit, that extra $80 doesn‚Äôt show up in the cash flow statement until they actually receive it.Why Investors Like Cash Flow Over Profit



# Quick Tips for Evaluating Cash Flow Trends

Look for Positive Operating Cash Flow: This means the company is making money from its main business.

>**Check Free Cash Flow**: High FCF can be a great sign, but if it‚Äôs super high, they might not be investing enough in growth.

>**Watch the Trend Over Time**: Stable or rising cash flow trends are usually good. If it‚Äôs dropping, it might be worth a deeper look.

.

Picking stocks in the market is kind of like picking items at a supermarket. You‚Äôre trying to get the best deal, right? You‚Äôre comparing brands, checking prices, maybe even using coupons.

 Investors use a similar approach in the stock market‚Äîthey just use financial metrics instead of coupons.Two of the key metrics that help investors spot a good deal are **Return on Assets (ROA)** and **Return on Equity (ROE)**.

# What is ROA?

**ROA** (Return on Assets) is like a measure of how efficient a company is with what it owns. In simple terms, it shows how much profit the company makes for every dollar of assets it has.

https://preview.redd.it/6d902d2c9u0e1.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e9b125e88a8baecf99e4dd91e7eb2ce71c028bb

**The higher the ROA, the better**‚Äîit means the company is getting more profit out of each dollar in assets.**Example**:

* Let‚Äôs say two coffee shops, A and B, each own $100,000 in assets.
* Coffee Shop A earns $20,000 in profit, while Coffee Shop B earns $30,000.
* Their ROA would be:
   * **Coffee Shop A**: $20,000 √∑ $100,000 = **20% ROA**
   * **Coffee Shop B**: $30,000 √∑ $100,000 = **30% ROA**

Coffee Shop B has a higher ROA, meaning it‚Äôs using its assets to generate more profit.

https://preview.redd.it/xowlt1ne9u0e1.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd8939dfe8da968772abf58eb940df4673994b2

# What is ROE?

**ROE** (Return on Equity) measures how much profit a company makes with its shareholders‚Äô money. If you‚Äôre a shareholder, ROE tells you how well the company is using your investment. 

In other words, **ROE = Net Income √∑ Shareholders‚Äô Equity**

https://preview.redd.it/5zc56ovn9u0e1.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&s=01bd758807e585ea26f7b903c2d5086b9eeba07e

**Example** (continuing with our coffee shops):

* Let‚Äôs say Coffee Shop A has $50,000 in debt and $50,000 in shareholders‚Äô equity.
   * ROE = $20,000 √∑ $50,000 = **40% ROE**
* Coffee Shop B has no debt, so its shareholders‚Äô equity is $100,000.
   * ROE = $30,000 √∑ $100,000 = **30% ROE**

Here, Coffee Shop A has a higher ROE because it‚Äôs generating more profit per dollar of shareholders‚Äô equity.

https://preview.redd.it/5tkvh0vm9u0e1.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&s=4446276120273b870d8b684b4b248a0ba5ba8bc6

# Why Investors Like High ROA and ROE

In general, investors like high ROA and ROE because they suggest that the company is efficient and making good use of its resources.

But sometimes, **an extremely high ROE can be a warning sign**:

1. **One-time boosts**: If a company‚Äôs profit spiked due to a one-time event, it may not be sustainable.
2. **Debt-driven ROE**: Some companies increase their ROE by taking on debt to buy back shares, which reduces shareholders‚Äô equity without necessarily increasing profits. This raises ROE on paper but doesn‚Äôt always mean the company is in better shape.

# What Counts as a Good ROA or ROE?

There‚Äôs no magic number that makes a ‚Äúgood‚Äù ROA or ROE because it varies by industry. For example:

* Tech companies may have high ROAs because they don‚Äôt require as much physical capital.
* Manufacturing companies often have lower ROAs since they own expensive equipment.

The best way to evaluate these ratios is by comparing them to:

1. **The industry average**: Higher-than-average ROA or ROE generally means the company is outperforming its peers.
2. **The company‚Äôs past performance**: A stable or rising trend over time is a good sign, while a falling trend may raise concerns.

.

# Key Takeaways

>**Cash Flow is the Lifeblood**: Cash flow statements track actual money in and out, giving investors a clear view of a company‚Äôs operational health. **Positive cash flow from operating activities** is a good sign that the company can cover its day-to-day expenses.

>**Free Cash Flow Matters**: Free cash flow (the cash left after operating expenses and investments) is critical for investors. It shows whether the company has enough flexibility to grow, pay dividends, or reduce debt. However, **extremely high free cash flow** can sometimes mean the company isn‚Äôt reinvesting enough in its future growth.

>**ROA Shows Efficiency with Assets**: ROA (Return on Assets) measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate profit. A **high ROA** suggests the company is good at making money from its assets.

>**ROE Shows Efficiency with Shareholders‚Äô Money**: ROE (Return on Equity) measures profitability with investors' capital. A **high ROE** usually indicates the company is providing a strong return on shareholder investment. However, if ROE is unusually high, check if it‚Äôs due to one-time boosts or debt-funded buybacks, which don‚Äôt always reflect sustainable growth.

>**Context is Key**: Always compare cash flow, ROA, and ROE to the industry average and the company‚Äôs past performance. Stable or improving trends signal a company in good financial health, while declining trends may be a red flag.

I was sitting down and waiting for my first pot of coffee to  finish when in pops and older woman. I quickly hide behind the door to see if she'll go away. She doesn't. 

""Can I help you?"" I ask as kindly as possible as I rush behind the desk. Of course she's here to check in. I tell her I'll probably have to make her a new reservation and she says nothing. 

I check and sure enough it's a third party. ""Since this is third party, I need to make a new reservation. Your original reservation went void."" 

Of course she's confused and appalled, I do my best at explaining the system to her but she still doesn't understand. I tell her I'll need a new card since I'm not allowed to duplicate virtual cards. 

She explains to me again that it's already been paid for, I explain to her again that the reservation is void. She tells me nowhere on the website does it say anything about that. I apologize. 

She asks what I want her to do, I tell her there's nothing I can do unless she gets me a new card. ""This is sad."" She keeps saying. ""Well, you're going to get me receipts from that stay and from this stay."" Before I can do any of that, I need a card to contrinue. I ask to see her card. She smirks, waves it in front of me and says ""see it?"" 

This is when all of my customer service goes out the window. She asks a question that I can‚Äôt remember, I answer it, and she just stares at me dumbfounded.  ""Can I help you?"" I ask. 

""You can give me a room, that's how you can help me."" Alright, I say. And I get her her receipt from her no show. ""No, no, I'm not paying this. Why is this one cheaper than what you're charging me?""

""Because it's an online reservation."" She says she should be paying the online price. In my monotone voice I say ""we don't price match."" 

""Yes you do,"" she says. 
""No, we don't.""
""Yes, you do.""
""Oh yeah? Says who? Says [guest name?]

""What's your name?"" She asks. I slam the card down in front of her and wave her off. ""I'm not telling you, goodnight and goodbye"" I say. I go off to the back office. ""Excuse me"" she calls! ""Can I help you?"" I ask, making sure she hears the anger in my voice. ""What's your name?"" She asks. 

""My name is get the fuck out of my face.""
That's when she gets her phone out and starts recording. ""You should have used your customer service"" she taunts. ""I don't use my customer service when people yell at me,"" I explain to audience. 

""I wasn't yelling!"" She rebuts. 
""Yes, you were. You were demanding that we price match you.""
""No, I was saying that you should.""
""Nope, you demanded.""

I don't remember exactly what was said but she kept talking over me but I ended up calling her a bitch. She tells me ""I hope you don't want your job"" and I tell her I could care less about my job because I hate dealing with people like her all night. I wave her off, kiss the camera goodbye, and she tells me she's off to write the emails. ""Have fun"" I shout as I type an explanation to my boss before she has a chance to snitch.

After that naisip ko na lang iend life ko kase ano na lang mangyayari sakin kung titigil ako eh sobrang delay na nga ako sa pag aaral dahil nagstop ako nung pandemic pero nakakatakot, hindi ko kaya. 

Hindi ko na po alam gagawin ko, please anyone here willing magpahiram? Ofcourse i'll send proofs and personal infos about me. Kahit hulug hulugan ko araw araw/weekly gusto ko talaga mag aral ayoko mag stop, once masettle ko tong balance na to maghahanap ako part time job, well as of now nga naghahanap na ako (also baka may willing din maghelp saan or anong pwedeng part time job as a college student).",1,1731578400.0,Philippines,0,1.0,False

He‚Äôs a decent guy- caring, great listener, respectful. Overall he is a green flag. There‚Äôs just one issue that‚Äôs been bugging me. He doesn‚Äôt pay for anything. I don‚Äôt expect him to be wining and dining me but it is the beginning stages of courtship so I expect some level of wanting to treat me or woo me. 
It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve ever thought of in the past because it has been organic with exes.. he picks up the check at dinner one night and then I‚Äôll get a few rounds of pints on our next date. It ebbs and flows. 
But with this guy he hasn‚Äôt paid for anything in the past 2 months. I assumed he may not be as financially comfortable as me and I do enjoy our time together so I tend to buy my own cinema ticket or pay for my half of dinner ect. That was until we went for a coffee the other day and he asked to split the bill.. for a 4 dollar cup of coffee. That‚Äôs when it hit me that I don‚Äôt think I can have a future with this guy. 
If I was in my twenties still I think this issue would bother me less but now I‚Äôm in my thirties I‚Äôm looking to build a life with someone who I can share everything with (this includes finances). I want a partner to can match my life style in terms of holidays, going for meals ect and eventually kids. But if he can‚Äôt afford / isn‚Äôt willing to buy me a cup of coffee in the courtship phase is this grounds for breaking up? He‚Äôs a really great guy but this level of ‚Äòcheap‚Äô is really bothering me. Should I discuss this with him or should I call things off? ",2,1731578255.0,dating_advice,5,0.75,False

I'm a veteran and a wildland firefighter in Oregon. My girlfriend is white and a nurse. I have no kids anand I've never been married and she has three kids all over 16. We meet on Facebook dating, I was about to delete my profile and she messaged me. We clicked almost immediately and a few days later I asked her out on a date. Everything was great we seemed like we were a great match. We have a second date, first kiss then I get called out to my first fire of the season.

During fire season we are often out for 2 weeks with 48hrs of R&R. During the first R&R she caught Covid so I dropped off care packages and anything she needed. During my second R&R sshe told me that whatever I needed to do for us to be alone, make it happen... that went great! My third R&R went the same. We made it official we were dating. My 4th R&R  she said she loved me. Fire season ends and we have been together for about a month and a half.

Now that fire season is over I ask her out to dinner. She accepts and then sleeps all day and finally messages me at 2230, 3 hours after we were supposed to meet. No harm no foul she works nights and had worked the day before. We plan for her to stay over the next week. The day comes and she says her period started out of nowhere, whatever I just wanted to spend time with her. I can tell she's pushing me away though. The night is kinda awkward and in the morning I got up to pee. When I got back in bed and pull a arm around her she perked away. I said ok got up and got ready for the day. 3 days later she says she needs a break because her Ex is completely suicidal and it's no fair to be with me while focusing on him. We have been together for 2 months.

Ok i ""think"" this is the father of her youngest daughter, so I get why this is something that needs to be dealt with. I tell her to take as long as she needs and to reach out to me when she feels like she's ready to talk. 3 days go by and she sends a text saying there's alot going on and she will tell me when she can. OK fine. Then she asks if I can help her daughter collect cans to raise the last bit of money for her trip coming up. I drop off 3 55gal bags of bottles and cans and they go on their trip. 

I go on my own trip to get my stuff out of storage and then drive across country. She starts messaging me like it's all good we aren't on break except after 2-3 texts she grows cold with short uninterested replies. So now I'm no longer looking forward to talking to her because it feels like I've done or said something wrong. On Facebook and tiktok she is posting and liking those love yourself and never settle on someone pages. To me it looks like I'm being a shitty boyfriend because it says we are in a relationship on our pages and we haven't seen each other in a month. 

I finished my trip yesterday and she was flying back with her daughter. She tells me she got flagged at TSA and frisked and a guy was laughing at her so she said ""it must be this bomb ass pussy"" ok sure not your normal joke but ok. Then later at her gate she is joking with the guy about piercings and again having ""bomb ass pussy"". This woman shuts down in texts if you get too sexual, now she's in the airport with her daughter joking about her pussy with someone at the airport. 

So now I'm kinda here confused. WTF is going on. Why is your ex suicidal? What are we doing? What is the point of these texted. Her birthday is coming up in a couple weeks and I kinda want to figure this out before then. I believe I've been really good to this woman, her phone was broken so I got her a replacement, when her money was short I would leave cash in her pocket or purse. Brought her dinner and coffee at work even though I live 45 minutes away. I honestly just want a steady stable relationship and this doesn't seem like it's going that way. It's been 2 days since she got back from her trip and it's been radio silence 

Am I overthinking this and I should give her more time or should I set some rules for this break period or should I just break up with her while she figures her shit out? I'm honestly really torn on this right now. Thanks for listening.

TL;DR  My fairly reserved girlfriend of 2 months asked for a break, after no contact for 3 days she is now half heartedly texting me and joking about her pussy with strangers at the airport while on vacation with her daughter. Now that our trips are over, we are back to not speaking. Should i just end the break and fully break up with her?",1,1731578197.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Normally for Christmas I bake a bunch of cookies, babysit all the children and teens for an afternoon and get them to help me decorate them, the youngest is now 10, so we‚Äôre quite the skilled group and it‚Äôs a fun activity for everyone. We generally get enough that all of them can have a few while we decorate, bring some home to give as gifts or to eat later and to have a nice little spread for Christmas Eve dinner. Plus it frees up their parents for an afternoon so they can shop for gifts or have a little peace. All good stuff, inspired a few years ago by American movies. 

This year one of the oldest kids (16) decided to try being vegan. Nobody in the family minded, as we‚Äôve worked out vegetarian options (the 16yo and their mom have been vegetarian for about 5years) and in most cases switching from vegetarian to vegan is not a huge problem, but I‚Äôm stumped!
I really don‚Äôt want to exclude them from this activity and the fun of eating the cookies, but all my Christmas cookie recipes come with butter and eggs in the mix.

Before you tell me to google this, I have, but I don‚Äôt 100% trust the results and would really appreciate the tried and true ones, if you‚Äôre willing to share. 

Usually I make:
- Gingerbread cookies decorated with royal icing 
- Vanilla/chocolate/coffee flavored shortbread decorated with either melted chocolate or royal icing.

As I inch up to this milestone it hits me how much easier it was then I thought it would be. I can still think back to the day I stopped answering. It was like a light switch went on in my head and I realized ‚Äúwow, I don‚Äôt have to deal with any of this‚Äù. 

She had been complaining for weeks about her neighbor in the condo above her playing music all night every night. Calling me every single day to moan about how no one would do anything and how it was ruining her sleep. The kicker? The condo was empty. No one lived there. She received a letter from The Board, offering to come to her unit during the hours she was complaining she heard the noise, (9pm-3am), and was having an absolute MELTDOWN about how rude they were to think that was an option. 

How could this Board not just take her word and look for concrete evidence? See, she hates being told she‚Äôs wrong. So she was spiraling. I offered up a half hearted ‚Äúwell at least they want to come hear it for themselves so they can do something about it?‚Äù. Wrong response me. The wrath was turned to me instantly. I was an ungrateful, unsupportive, terrible daughter. I didn‚Äôt care about her. I was just as bad as The Board.  So I stepped back and let her have her moment. Gave her a few days. 

Meanwhile, during this timeframe my then 5 year old daughter was transitioning into kindergarten and having a rough go of it. (Post Covid school was crazy yall). I made the mistake of telling my mom, during our weekly scheduled call, that she‚Äôd been having some behaviour issues that day and I wasn‚Äôt going to put her on the phone for a chat. 

I‚Äôll never forget her response. She paused and then said ‚Äúgive me one week with her and I‚Äôll have that fixed‚Äù.  

It struck me to my core. She liked hurting me. She LIKES hurting people. She likes hurting people who cannot defend themselves. She likes hurting kids. My childhood came flooding back to me. 

Every slap, punch, hair pull. Every time she poured liquid soap down my throat. Every time she slammed my head into the car window while she was driving. Every time she got in my face, her eyes wide and feverish, screaming from an inch away. Her coffee breath spraying over me. When I was 8 and had a rats nest so bad in the back of my head that mold grew in it. Crying, finally breaking down asking her for help with my hair knowing how badly it would hurt. (She would later admit that baths and hair brushing was a chore which was why she never taught me how to do it properly). 

Even worse then the physical was the emotional and mental abuse. The silent treatment where I would become a ghost in my own home. Where she would look right through me until I collapsed to my knees begging her to forgive me for things I didn‚Äôt know I had done. 

‚ÄúGive me one week with her‚Äù. 

That was it. I haven‚Äôt said a single word to her since. 

I look at my now seven year old daughter who has never had someone raise a hand to her and think to myself, ‚Äúhow could you want to hurt her? How could you want to hurt me?‚Äù 

I get the calls from my siblings. Most recently my older brother invited me to his family home for Thanksgiving. I asked if she would be there and the response was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to have to get over it eventually‚Äù. But I don‚Äôt have to get over it. Ever. I never have to speak to her again and I refuse to feel badly about that. I have my daughter who doesn‚Äôt have to be a ghost and that means more to me then someone who never acted like they loved me. Someone who every night I would say from my bedroom ‚Äúgoodnight mom, I love you‚Äù, and in response I would get a ‚Äúyeah‚Äù.

\- **Can I do something about tiredness** apart from drinking 2x cups of coffee so that I can keep doing my job?

\- **Should I rest or** should I actually go out, do fun stuff, **live a normal life**?

\- I desperately **need to go back to the gym** and lift some stuff, it clears up my mind soo much and stops me from going down the spiral of depression, self-deprecation and suicidal thoughts. But **my spleen hurts a bit some days, and I feel super weak**. **Will exercise help me or will it worsen my condition**?

\- I don't feel like eating at all. Should I force myself to eat more? I've been forcing myself to eat ever since I started working out, but lately I barely eat at all. Will eating too much harm me? Can I keep taking protein for working out, alongside a good diet and more food quantity?

Thanks all.....

Here's some context if you feel like reading it....

I've been having skin rashes for 3-4 months, and the symptoms have varied and are a bit intermittent. At some point my throat was really sore, my neck lymph nodes were really enlarged, and my current symptoms are skin rashes (mild), red spots on my hands and arms that look like healed wounds but won't go away.

What's bothering me the most right now is tinnitus (high-pitched sound in my ears CONSTANTLY) and for some reason I not only lost hearing (I can barely hear my alarm clock!) but also high-pitched sounds (such as beeps from my microwave, or the uppermost octaves on my piano) sound distorted and higher in pitch to me, which is a total PITA because I used to have a pitch-perfect ear and now playing piano is... weird...

The worst of all is the tiredness, and symptoms of depression because I'm going through a lot lately in my life and not being able to work, focus, or go out and do fun stuff is taking a toll in my mental health.

My doctor said it was probably mono, and told me I should do absolutely normal life. However, it's scary because I don't want these symptoms to go chronic and I'm probably being too cautious? Also my doctor seemed not to care too much about it",1,1731577054.0,Mononucleosis,0,1.0,False

Navigating the dating scene‚Äîespecially on Feeld has been far more challenging and intimidating than I expected at this stage of life at. I‚Äôm struggling to find people who are interested in not only me but potentially exploring with both of us, and I let my frustrations about the type of people interested in me get the better of me.

When my ex reached out on Instagram, I saw it as an opportunity to talk with someone safe, who I know and of the opposite sex, who is also our age and knows I‚Äôm deeply in love with my wife (and that she feels the same about her husband). While I like to be flirty, I thought I could get an outside perspective from someone who understood where I was coming from. But I knew my wife preferred I not reach out to my ex, and I went ahead and asked her to coffee anyway. Unknown to my intentions were to keep it safe and respectful, but in the midst of pursuing other connections, I see now how bad this choice looks.

I was honest with my wife almost immediately that I had reached out, spoken with her, and said I would disengage. She was hurt, and I realized right away that this was a mistake and unfair to our agreement. Though she couldn‚Äôt hear my apology at that moment, I let her know I was sorry.

Looking back, I can see that this wasn‚Äôt respectful to our boundaries, and that my frustrations influenced my response to her reaching out. I could tell how hurt she was, and I‚Äôm committed to respecting her boundaries moving forward. I want to keep exploring the ENM side of our marriage but find myself feeling lost and uncertain about what feels safe for me.

My wife has been meeting great matches, and I‚Äôm genuinely excited for her to explore this side of herself, but I keep making mistakes with these smaller requests. To boot in the middle of it all our girlfriend of 5months showed up last night after being gone for the last 2-3 months. That also has us both spun for a loop. To be honest, I‚Äôm starting to dread the dating app because matches I get have been real disappointment.

If anyone has advice, I‚Äôd appreciate it: What are some ways to work through challenges and repair broken boundaries in an ENM marriage?",2,1731576900.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False
1gr163w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gr163w/aitah_for_blowing_off_my_best_friends_wedding/,AITAH for Blowing Off my Best Friends Wedding,"Back with a different story. Wanted to get reddit's opinion on this. I have a friend group from college, all guys. And its been 10 years since weve graduated and were still as close as ever. One of the guys from our friend group, lets call him Three, is getting married in a few months. When he announced it to us, We were so excited as he is the first one in the group to propose and get married. Its a big deal for all of us. We half expected that we would be part of his entourage, but things can change ofcourse. Nearing his wedding day, about 2 months before, he had notified us of the theme of the wedding. He then goes about and says that he is only pick 2 out of the 5 of us as part of his entourage. I was initially taken a back. I intially thought that we were closer than that. I believe we would have been part of his entourage. I got a bit sad because admittedly I have FOMO. My GF made me realize that there can be a number of reason and also, that it is his wedding and he can do what he wants and we should understand. That made me more at ease as it is true. I wouldnt want someone demanding something at my wedding. 

I talked to one of our friend that was part of the Entourage, lets call him Fly. He confirmed that Three didnt have a specific reason, but it was well within his rights. And the fact that the ""entourage"" was not a big deal for Three. He just picked some people from his many group of friends. Again that made so much sense to me that I thought I was being immatture. 

My issue came from Three's attitude towards me and the other members of the group on the build to the marriage. Since Fly was a little bit uncomfortable that the whole group wasnt part of the entourage, he was inviting us to small events leading to the wedding. Started with the Suit Fitting. They went to a famous suit rental place and in our group chat, Fly intially asked everyone to join us in the fitting since we would be attending the wedding together. Three then messages and says that the rental place was small and would not be able to accomodate the addition of me and another member. (There were 8 of them) Fly also said that we could come AFTER the fitting and just join them for dinner but again, Three was not keen on letting us join. 

Another instance was the bachelors party where Fly again suggested that me and Jupiter join the festivities. Then again, Three would say negatively that he would rather just have the entourage to join.

This kind of got me a bit angry but mostly sad and got me thinking what did I do that may have caused this. So in an act of immatturity, I removed my nickname in our group chat. It was petty of me to do so. But part of me wanted them to acknowledge the issue. I know Three knows what he is doing. The sad thing about it was after that, he sent a message to Jupiter but didnt send a message to me. Admittedly I felt unheard and left out. 

So i blew off going to the wedding party. Me and Jupiter went to the church and when he approached us, he talked to us like nothing happened. Nobody was acknowledging anything. And it was awkward and sad. Jupiter and I went home and just had coffee and talked about if we were immatture and if we were in the right for not attending the wedding party. I wanted everyone's opinion on this. Set me straight or confirm if what im feeling is valid or am I immatture. So Are we the asshole. 

Edit: Jupiter and I share the same opinion about Three leaving us out of celebration leading up to the wedding.  ",4,1731576883.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

I received a Yeti french press (the 64oz variety) as a gift a couple of days ago. Overall, I love the sturdy feel and insulation, but there is one small problem. A couple of hours after plunging, the coffee starts to take on a silicone-like taste, I assume from the flap above the mesh filter of the plunger? It was washed in the dishwasher both times before using. Is that silicone flavor just something that happens when the press is new and it will go away over time? I heated my water to 195F and steeped for 3 minutes if that's of any concern.",1,1731576857.0,YetiCoolers,0,1.0,False

1gr14w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gr14w4/dropping_out_of_college/,Dropping out of college,"Hi! Due to depression and anxiety (mostly social) I dropped out of college the beginning of this fall. The entire high school, I was one of the top students in my class, but looking back my biggest motivation was a fear of failure and my belief that grades determined my worth. I needed good grades to feel at least somewhat adequate, to feel good enough since I always struggled with low self esteem caused by my overly critical father and slightly toxic upringing. The first year of college was okay, but then my social anxiety got pretty bad, I dreaded every minute I had to spend in the class, worrying about not being able to answer the teacher‚Äôs question and feeling awkward, stupid and useless. Just sitting in the class made me completely exhausted. And I‚Äôm not evening talking about oral exams and interpreting classes, which were a nightmare for me. On top of that, I worked part time in a busy coffee shop and while I loved the job, I started stuggling there as well, any time I had to deal with an arrogant customer or I messed up something even just a little tiny bit I would beat myself up about it and break down. Then last summer I had a major break down over everything that‚Äôs wrong with my life and I self harmed for the first time as a punishment. I quit the job and registred as a special needs student to be able to be more absent. It didn‚Äôt really help, after Christmas I decided to drop out which I did this summer. I originally though I‚Äôd come back after a year, but I don‚Äôt think I can do it. Everyone‚Äôs just telling me that I will regret it. But my depression has been getting worse and worse, I struggle even with far more easier thing than college - I barely find the energy to get up in the morning, I don‚Äôt cook, I don‚Äôt clean my home, I haven‚Äôt read a book in over a year. I would love to just sleep my life away, every morning I can‚Äôt wait for the day to be over, there‚Äôs nothing to look forward to. I spend most of my free time just sleeping or mindlessly scrolling through my phone. I cut myself pretty often and have suicidal thoughts which scare me. I‚Äôm exhausted all the time. I go to therapy and take antidepressants. I was just wondering if anyone else is dealing with this guilt and shame of not going to college and not really having any other purpose in life either. And also, if anyone knows where‚Äôs the line between avoiding problems vs protecting your health. Because I feel like if I went back to school now and there was just the slightest thing I‚Äôd see as a failure, I would probably lose control and kill myself. Which is the biggest reason why I don‚Äôt want to come back, to protect myself because I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able handle ANY sort of criticism or just not living up to my expectation.

Short: Dropped out of college because of mental health and scared that returning would make even more suicidal. If you dropped out for similar reasons, did you go back? Did you regret it? Do you see it as a failure or taking care of yourself?",1,1731576722.0,depression,1,1.0,False

At this point she was done w her she hated that she left her in the apartment alone with no notice whatever I‚Äôm like okay yeah fuck her. Fast forward she is still friends with her ?? She continues to hang with her and then would rant to me about how much she would waste money on her for food and how she was inconsiderate and bought Large meals lmao and how she even asked her to help her get a job with her sister bc they‚Äôre both early childhood majors but she said I‚Äôm not gonna help her get a job she‚Äôs terrible with kids whatever.

1gr140o,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSbookclub/comments/1gr140o/agatas_machine_camilla_grudova/,Agata's Machine - Camilla Grudova,"AGATA AND I WERE BOTH ELEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN SHE FIRST INTRODUCED ME TO HER MACHINE. We were in all the same classes. She was sallow and thin, with enormous hands and feet. She wore her dark brown hair in a short bob, held back from her face with a plain, plastic barrette. Her eyebrows weren‚Äôt thick, but they were long, stretching to her temples. Her mouth was wide, but her lips were thin, with an expressiveness that reminded me of worms.
 

She wasn‚Äôt tormented by our schoolmates and teachers, as I was. The only student they treated worse than me was Large Barbara, who was so fat she walked with a cane, had one lazy eyeball, and a wart on her chin so long and thin it mocked the rest of her body. Agata wasn‚Äôt teased or tormented because she was a genius. She excelled in the sciences and maths, and could write beautiful, complex poems, though she only did so when it was a school assignment. She often yawned and shook one of her legs in class; she finished her work before everyone else. Some teachers let her read her own books, imported ones in foreign languages, full of complicated diagrams just as mysterious to the rest of us as the words.

 

Though she wasn‚Äôt bullied, she also didn‚Äôt have any friends. She seemed above such trivialities. No one invited her to parties ‚Äì it was impossible to imagine her at them. She spent her lunch break reading. She didn‚Äôt play or gossip. She saw the other students as a nuisance, like flies or fleas. Some tried to pay her to do their homework, but she responded with, ‚ÄòYou think I don‚Äôt have better things to do?‚Äô in a tone of voice that was arrogant, and delighted in its own arrogance, her worm mouth wiggling.

 

Agata‚Äôs parents were poor because they had so many children, but they still bought her whatever she needed or desired so she could focus on her schoolwork: books, expensive pens, cigarettes. Agata was the eldest, and the most promising of her siblings. The rest were snivelly, slow readers who wore second-hand clothes that had seen too many threadbare childhoods. Because their clothes were so old, so outdated, their hair so sparse, their limbs so rickety, and their foreheads so large, they looked like little old men, even the girls. Agata didn‚Äôt care about clothes. I was sure her parents would buy her nice outfits, if she asked.

 

She wore cheap looking floral dresses, meant for an older housewife, and large men‚Äôs shoes‚Äìhand-me-downs from her father. When it was wet outside, she wore black rubber galoshes over her shoes, making her feet look even larger. In class she wore slippers of fuzzy grey wool.

 

I was vain and wore the same thin, white, feminine shoes all year round, even though the soles suffered under the pressure of my weight, and the material let water soak through, my toes and heels stained from the dye in my stockings.

 

In class, I discreetly took my shoes off under my desk to let my feet dry, blue and black imprints on the inner lining of my shoes. These stains horrified and embarrassed me, as if the dye had come out of my body instead of my stockings.

 

One morning it was so wet outside that dyed water dripped from my feet onto the classroom floor. Agata, who was sitting behind me, whispered, ‚ÄòYour foot is crying.‚Äô

 

She didn‚Äôt say it loud enough for anyone else to hear, but I blushed.

 

Swiftly, she moved her own foot under my desk, and within a second the small puddle was gone.

 

She did it again and again, whenever a puddle formed, until my stockings, dry enough near the end of the day, ceased to drip.

 

Leaving class at the end of the day, she put her large hand on my arm and whispered in my ear. ‚ÄòCome home with me, there‚Äôs something I want to show you.‚Äô

 

I was filled with dread, as if a few more hours of class had been added to my day. What was she going to show me? Maths textbooks, a home laboratory kit? I was too afraid to say no, in case she would tell the rest of our class about my ‚Äòcrying foot‚Äô, in case she would yell, loud enough for everyone to hear, ‚ÄòYour foot cries!‚Äô

 

I was unsure whether I was embarrassed walking home with her or not.

 

I didn‚Äôt like the disgusting sound of her galoshes, the smell of her cigarettes, but she walked with such ease and confidence, with such disdain for everyone we passed by in our village. She wore fingerless gloves, a canvas knapsack so full it sagged down her legs, and a ragged blue military coat with flaking gold buttons.

 

 

*

 

Agata‚Äôs family lived on the main floor of a five-floor building. The landlord allowed Agata to use the attic as a study. In exchange, Agata‚Äôs father cleaned and maintained the foyer and the halls of the building, though he already had a full-time job as a clerk at a small glassware factory that specialised in vases.

 

Her mother, with all her other children, was too busy to clean the halls herself, said Agata. We briefly stopped in the family apartment before heading to her attic. There were children everywhere, and no sign of the life Agata lived; no books, only tacky lithographic prints of historic buildings, dark Madonna and Child icons dotting the walls like speckles on a crow‚Äôs egg. I wondered if Agata had to share a bedroom with her siblings.

 

Her mother was thin and going bald. Her pregnant stomach was ridiculous and reminded me of a hard-boiled egg, a food no one at school would eat without shame because of its terrible smell and uncanny, wobbly movements once the shell was removed. She wore a cheap metal necklace, childish rings, and a dress just like Agata‚Äôs. When introduced to her, I suppressed a giggle.

 

Agata didn‚Äôt greet any of her younger siblings, but grabbed two bread rolls off the table.

 

‚ÄòBring us coffee in a bit,‚Äô she said to her mother, and pulled me out and upwards to her attic.

 

She unlocked the door with a key kept in one of her coat pockets, and took off her galoshes and shoes. She put on a pair of crusty looking slippers from a ragged mat in the hall. I also took off my shoes, but the floor of her attic was dirty, covered with peeling linoleum, carpet and patches of wood, a repulsive mixture that reminded me of bandages that needed to be changed and the flaky, scabby skin underneath.

 

The walls of Agata‚Äôs attic were half-covered in maps and diagrams, a large poster of the periodic table, a map of the world. There were books everywhere, telescopes, glass vials and microscopes. A green metal desk with a ragged, greasy armchair in front of it. A glass vase full of brown water and cigarette butts. Socks, papers, teacups and mousetraps ‚Äì one with a flattened and dried mouse under its metal bar. I had assumed she would be meticulous and clean.

 

In the middle of the attic was something large and awkward-looking, covered with a wool blanket. In one corner there was a headless garment dummy, its canvas torso covered in writing, too smudged to read. Agata took off her coat and hung it on the dummy. She lit a cigarette, and started to eat one of the rolls. She threw the other one to me. It was rock hard. I nibbled at it, but was used to finer things: my parents were grocers and I took pleasure in eating. For Agata, eating seemed like a distracting chore. She ate the bread roll with such indifference it could have been a raw potato or a marrow bone, she wouldn‚Äôt have noticed.

 

After she finished it, and her cigarette, she rubbed her large, bony hands together and tore the blanket off the object in the centre of the attic.

 

A gigantic black insect. It was a sewing machine, an old malicious one, black and gold, attached to its own desk with a treadle underneath, wrought metal like the grates over fire stoves and sewers. I was dumbfounded. Was she going to show me something both intricate and hideous that she had made? I knew from home economics class that she was a good sewer. If we finished a project before class was over, our teacher would make us mend her husband‚Äôs socks, shirts, trousers and underwear. Agata was the only one who didn‚Äôt mind doing it; she was so indifferent to whatever cloth she was feeding the machine, and it was against her nature to sew deliberately slowly like the rest of us. So she pumped out, with spiritless speed, flat doppelg√§ngers of the teacher‚Äôs husband, the yellow pads of her tobacco-stained fingertips waltzing across the often unclean fabric which smelled like meat, soup, fruity liquors and that fried-onions-and-mushroom scent which oozes from the bodies of grown men, as if they were nothing but sacks of unwanted leftovers. Our home economics teacher was sour-looking and had a moustache. Some of us believed her husband was imaginary, that she‚Äôd bring the newly sewn pieces home, fill them with slops and potatoes so they‚Äôd gain life like proportions, and lie in bed with her creation, kissing it until the seams ripped, then bringing the pieces, ripped and stained with exaggeration, back to school with domestic pride, as if her husband was too large, too important, too filthy, too manly for her alone to manage.

 

At the sight of Agata‚Äôs sewing machine, my imagination whirred.

 

Agata would make me a pair of stockings I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take off. A pair that would swallow my legs and expand three-dimensionally with their own horrible breath, like balloons, that followed the direction of her will. She would cut me and sew me back up again like the baby toads she dissected with cold expertise in science class.

 

‚ÄòMy mother‚Äôs old sewing machine, but that‚Äôs not all,‚Äô she said.

 

I looked closer.

 

There was a large mason jar where the spool was supposed to go, perched on top of the sewing machine like a translucent egg being expelled from its body. Inside the jar was a cylindrical light bulb, the sepia colour of old photographs. Emerging from the top was a brown wire, attached like a thread to the levers and regulators before vanishing into a short wooden box where the needle was supposed to be. The wire reappeared from a small hole on the side of the box, ending in a black earpiece, culled from a telephone. The box had faded writing on the side. CIGARS, it said.

 

Agata pushed over her armchair and sat in front of the sewing machine. She started to pump the treadle. The large balance wheel started to turn, like a cinema reel. The jar started to move.

 

‚ÄòTurn off the lights,‚Äô she said. I did, finding the switch near the door. The mason jar glowed. A wobbly bubble of light travelled across the room, then again, but this time there was some sort of shape inside it that was not fully formed, parts of it blacker than shadow, that morphed, flickering, into a Pierrot. He danced across the room. His face, white with black lips and eyebrows, was so beautiful I blushed. I blushed for him to see us, in Agata‚Äôs filthy attic, our breath and armpits smelly from a day at school. His outfit was billowing white, with large black buttons, his feet small and pointed. I leaned against Agata‚Äôs chair, watching the Pierrot circle us, again and again.

 

I knew what a Pierrot was. In my parents‚Äô shop, there was a porcelain Pierrot bust. He had rosy cheeks and the word PIERROT was written across his chest. His shoulders were covered in holes to put lollipops in. The lollipops did not sell very well; children were afraid of the strange, foreign man with his black skullcap. My father had brought the Pierrot at an antique shop and thought it lent an air of elegance to his business. We had no idea what the original lollipops were like, and imagined horrible and exotic flavours ‚Äì crab, liquorice, goat, octopus ‚Äì rising from the Pierrot‚Äôs shoulders, the sugar spun into monstrous shapes.

 

Agata didn‚Äôt know the word ‚ÄòPierrot‚Äô; I taught it to her, and she was visibly grateful. It suited the handsome, romantic figure in her attic much better than ‚Äòclown‚Äô.

 

Agata handed me the earpiece. I didn‚Äôt hear anything. It was more like being listened to; as if there was a piece of shivering flesh behind the plastic. I didn‚Äôt see the Pierrot again, but this time appeared a man with white wings, wearing a striped sailor‚Äôs shirt, and wide sailor‚Äôs trousers. His hair was golden, greased back from his face, and his lips were red, very red, like he was wearing lipstick.

 

‚ÄòI have never seen him before. I have only seen the Pierrot. This is why I wanted someone else to try it.‚Äô Agata put out her hand for the earpiece, pressed it to her ear, and the Pierrot appeared again. He performed a pirouette and blew us a kiss.

 

When she stopped treadling, I looked at the still jar. There were no images pasted onto it like on a lantern, or on the glass slides shown in class. I would have been disappointed if there had been: the winged man felt like something I had illustrated or brought into being.

 

Before Agata could start treadling again there was a knock on the door, a quiet, nervous tap. Without getting up from her chair, she gestured for me to open it and to turn on the light.

 

Her mother brought us cups of fake coffee made with chicory, and vanilla wafers that dissolved as soon as we put them in our mouths. Agata had a cigarette, then she told me to turn the light off again.

 

I didn‚Äôt get home till late. My parents were pleased to hear I had been studying with Agata, for her intelligence was known around our whole village. The next morning I hoped, more than anything, that Agata would ask me to come over again. She did. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she liked my company, or only wanted to see the ‚Äòangel‚Äô man again, but either way it didn‚Äôt matter. I went every day, after school. Agata even borrowed a chair from her family‚Äôs apartment for me to sit on. It was a toddler‚Äôs chair, with short squat legs, the seat bedecked with colourful illustrations of dogs and flowers. Agata never let me pump the treadle of her machine.

 

By the time I went home each night I was starving, and my dinner, left on the table with a cloth on top, was lukewarm.

 

I was used to having a snack as soon as I got home from school, and I got into the habit of stealing things from my family‚Äôs shop for Agata and me to eat. I brought hazelnut wafers, caramel chews, soft iced-ginger cookies, dry sausages, bottles of raspberry syrup we mixed with water, preserved plums covered in chocolate and, at Agata‚Äôs request, an expensive brand of cigarettes with a picture of Romeo and Juliet on the packet, imported from a country in the Caribbean.

 

My father noticed I was taking things, and though he was glad I was studying (it was easy to lie to him about that), he couldn‚Äôt afford such indulgences, and from then on only allowed me to take food from the overstock room. It was full of large jars of plum jam, dark brown in colour, and tinned sardines. Besides the cigarettes, it didn‚Äôt make much difference to Agata. We ate the plum jam straight from the jar using spoons. I hated sardines, but Agata ate them, peeling off the silver skin and spitting out the bones.

My parents and I lived above our shop. We didn‚Äôt share any walls with neighbours, and I was fascinated by Agata‚Äôs building. It reminded me of the cabinet with dozens of tiny drawers where my parents kept precious seeds and spices. I became obsessed by the fantasy that the angel and Pierrot lived somewhere in the building, that their images had travelled through pipes and oozed through the attic walls like leaking water. When I confessed it to Agata, she called me an idiot, but I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on the machine until she‚Äôd introduced me to every neighbour. Every door was a disappointing drawer, full of tiny sticky flecks and withered cinnamon sticks. A breath of hope before the next one, then again, nothing. Finally, every room in the building had been emptied of my dreams, except the attic. I also begged her to let me see inside the cigar box. It was nothing to me; a tangle of wires and cogs, no tiny Pierrot and angel trapped inside like beautiful white mice in a cage.

 

The moving images came from us, or were connected to us, Agata couldn‚Äôt say exactly. She had made the machine in order to project images from her mind‚Äôs eye, but the Pierrot wasn‚Äôt anything she had seen or imagined before. The angel was just as new to me.

 

I remembered once visiting my aunt in the city, when she took me to an arcade where a fortune teller lived in a theatrical box with glass sides. The fortune teller, who wore a colourful turban and many jewels, was made from wax, with a silent wax mouth. If you put a coin in a slot underneath the glass, she released a tiny card with your future written on it. Mine said I would get married and have one child. Agata‚Äôs machine must have said something about our futures, for where else could the images come from?

 

I created beautiful and ridiculous scenarios in my mind. I was married to the angel, Agata to the Pierrot. The angel and I owned a small, white dog. I spent hours imagining how he would bathe without getting his wings wet, how I would stroke them and keep all the feathers that fell off in a red lacquered box.

 

I even dreamed that Agata‚Äôs Pierrot was secretly in love with me, that he was in a sense enslaved by her. In fact, he felt somehow originally mine, because of the Pierrot bust in my parents‚Äô shop. I knew the word, and had given it to her.

 

I knew Agata had fantasies too, but hers were perhaps filled with more knowledge of the world. Just as she knew how to smoke cigarettes without coughing and read foreign languages, so could she construct an imaginary marriage much more thorough than mine.

 

Sometimes she would suddenly say, ‚ÄòLeave now.‚Äô The light continued moving after I left ‚Äì I could see it under the door where I would stand until my legs hurt. I know she wanted to view the images in private. I never complained, I was too afraid of being banned from her machine forever. There was something in the way she said it ‚Äì ‚ÄòLeave‚Äô ‚Äì that made her seem more grown up than me. Yet we were dependent on each other like a pair of twins, conjoined by a dream rather than a body, for the angel appeared more often when I held the machine to my ear, and the Pierrot when she did. The machine, our secret, bound us together: I could tell her parents or our classmates, while she could tell my parents I wasn‚Äôt studying.

 

We weren‚Äôt friends, exactly. I was bothered by the sound of her breathing and sniffing, she always had a runny nose, and she screamed at me for sucking my teeth, for noisily passing gas. Our bodies were nuisances to the enjoyment of the machine. I asked my father if I could borrow his record player, which folded up neatly into a suitcase. Music greatly enhanced the whole experience as it made it seem like our dear friends were not silent and unbreathing but, like us, merely drowned out by the music.

 

The colour of the attic‚Äôs walls, the greyish pink wallpaper with its pattern of green ferns curled like little goblin‚Äôs ears, gave the angel and Pierrot the appearance of having a skin disease. I didn‚Äôt notice this detail in my initial enchantment, but it became noticeable as I demanded more from the machine, like a stomach expanding from eating an ever-increasing amount of food.

 

I had the idea of painting the walls white, but Agata didn‚Äôt approve ‚Äì it would mean days away from the machine, she didn‚Äôt want paint to get on her books, she didn‚Äôt want to pack up her things ‚Äì so I constructed a white collage along her walls using a white linen tablecloth, a large white blouse of my mother‚Äôs, some sheets of typing paper, cloth bags for sugar and flour from the grocery store, endpapers ripped out of books, a piece of wooden board I painted white myself and carried over. Any white scrap I could find. Agata agreed: the angel and Pierrot looked purer, fuller, against white.

 

I had a dream that I removed all my teeth and glued them to the walls. I removed Agata‚Äôs teeth too, but they were stained and crooked, as in real life. As soon as I extracted them they started to grow until they were the size and length of elephant tusks. They smelled like soiled laundry and were covered in tiny black cavities.

 

Once, Large Barbara tried to follow us home, as if she could smell we were up to something important. We ran, Large Barbara‚Äôs cane rattling against the stones of the streets behind us. It was a horrible cane, with a doll‚Äôs head on the top, soiled and squished by Large Barbara‚Äôs sweaty hand. She screamed and screamed, irregular sounds, like the varied contents of a small, travelling menagerie, her cane a large beak or claw hitting the bars. She couldn‚Äôt catch up.

 

We didn‚Äôt mention the incident once we were upstairs, but the attic contained a thought too repellent to voice: what would Large Barbara, who was hopeless, an idiot, see with her ear against the machine? If she were to see, for example, a beautiful prince, wearing turquoise trousers and a yellow sash, it would mean the machine had no base in the future, or reality, and was nothing more than a reflection of our desires.

 

I don‚Äôt remember the date of the day Mr Magnolia first appeared. All days had melted into each other, into an amber-coloured syrup that slowly hardened under the whirring of Agata‚Äôs machine.

 

I do remember that Agata was holding the earpiece the first time Mr Magnolia appeared.

 

He was bald, except for a thin rim of hair like scum on a dirty bowl and a plain, unfanciful moustache shaped like the little plastic combs used for lice searches at school. He was old, like a father, and wore a suit, a drab, ill-fitting grey one.

 

As he moved across the room he sneered, stuck his tongue out and grabbed his crotch, his mouth open in a silent laugh.

 

We both gasped, but Agata didn‚Äôt stop treadling her machine.

 

The next round, the Pierrot reappeared, as if nothing had changed; then my angel, then Pierrot and the strange old man again, in an odd, nonsensical sequence.

 

Agata kept pumping, horrified and transfixed.

 

‚ÄòMr Magnolia,‚Äô she whispered, then added, ‚ÄòThe name came to me as he appeared. They must come from the same place, they must belong to each other.‚Äô

 

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know, I heard that word somewhere, yes, it‚Äôs his name.‚Äô

 

She looked the word up in her seven-volume dictionary. The different volumes were scattered around her attic and it took us a while to find L-M. We were surprised to learn that MAGNOLIA was a flower, a large pink or white one. The dictionary did not contain pictures or any more information, so we could only imagine how horrible the flower must be. We went to a flower shop.

 

‚ÄòDo you have any Magnolias?‚Äô I stumbled over the word, unsure if we were being obscene.

 

‚ÄòMagnolia grows on trees, I can‚Äôt sell a bushel of them. I have beautiful purple asters, poppies, carnations, roses. Silly girls, magnolias grow on trees!‚Äô said the shop owner, a broad woman with dyed hair and too much makeup, wearing a wet and stained apron over her dress.

 

Agata blushed at the word silly. It was the first time I had ever seen her blush.

 

‚ÄòHere, I‚Äôll show you a picture.‚Äô The shop owner went into the back of her shop, returning with a large, damp book.

 

‚ÄòIt can either be white, or pink. Girls, it grows on trees in foreign places!‚Äô she laughed. The flower looked like a dessert.

 

‚ÄòStupid, worthless dictionary. It should‚Äôve told us that,‚Äô Agata mumbled as we left. We walked back to her house in a hurry, both wanting to see Mr Magnolia again, to compare him with the image of the flower we had just seen. But there was no resemblance between the beautiful, large flower and the ugly plainness of Mr Magnolia, who grimaced at us and tugged at his trouser legs.

 

‚ÄòMr Magnolia, he must come from abroad. That is the connection. Perhaps he has an important message,‚Äô said Agata when we were back in her attic.

 

We recorded and tried to decode all his poses, gestures and faces, but it was really a way to kill time between seeing the Pierrot or the angel who struck us dumb. Whatever music was playing when Mr Magnolia appeared was made ridiculous. We could never play that song again. As Mr Magnolia continued to appear, more and more songs were ruined. I borrowed more records from my father‚Äôs collection ‚Äì symphonies, ballets, operas, folk songs ‚Äì and was careless with the ones we no longer wanted, tossing them across the attic. They cracked and were forgotten.

 

Sometimes Agata would say, ‚ÄòI am so sick of Mr Magnolia, thank you very much,‚Äô or ‚ÄòFuck you and your Mr Magnolia,‚Äô her lips curled, her head turned in my direction.

 

It was unfair of her to blame me for Mr Magnolia. He first appeared when the earpiece was held against her head. He slithered out of her mind like a maggot. Was he waiting to prance, like a devil, into both of our futures?

 

My parents noticed. I lost weight, I smelled like tobacco. I was behind on my schoolwork. My teachers had written my parents a letter, so they knew. Agata wasn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt hand in assignments anymore either, but I think the teachers believed she could do no wrong; they were firm in the belief that her work would be the best in class if she handed it in, so it wasn‚Äôt necessary for her to do so. She didn‚Äôt speak in class anymore, but sat sullenly, her arms crossed, one foot underneath her desk moving up and down as if pressing an invisible treadle.

 

Neither of us had appetites, our stomachs felt tight and curled like unblossomed flowers. We consumed only cigarettes, cups of black tea and spoonfuls of plum jam, brown and glistening like grease to smooth the cogs of a machine.

 

One evening, returning home bleary-eyed, my fingers sticky, my parents forbade me from returning to Agata‚Äôs. My mother said it was disgusting for a family to have so many children, and that she had heard they all slept in one big bed, boys and girls mixed. My mother picked me up from school the next day, and the next, and also dropped me off in the morning. The first night away from Agata‚Äôs machine, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

 

‚ÄòWhat happened?‚Äô I asked Agata as soon as we were seated in class.

 

‚ÄòNothing. The same. Mr Magnolia appeared fifty times, Pierrot twenty times.‚Äô

 

‚ÄòAnd my angel?‚Äô

 

‚ÄòNot once. He only appears when you are in the room.‚Äô

 

The thought gave me relief and hope. Had the angel missed me? Did he not think it worth it to appear if I wasn‚Äôt there?

 

Still, I worried he would appear for Agata alone the next day. Every morning I asked her, and she gave the same reply. After four days, she answered, ‚ÄòYes. He blew me a kiss.‚Äô

 

‚ÄòNo. I‚Äôm joking,‚Äô she snorted, when my face gave away my horror.

 

After a week, I stopped asking her, though she still told me. I acted indifferent, and it started to make me feel indifferent.

 

I felt calmer, more focused. I could read, do my homework. My appetite returned, my parents indulging whatever edible whims I had.

 

The time came, a few weeks later, when I felt assured that I could see Agata‚Äôs machine again without the intensity of feeling I had before.

 

I was even glad at the thought of seeing Mr Magnolia, but mostly I was curious to see how my reappearance would affect the expressions of the angel and Pierrot. Of course, my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me, so I had to sneak out after dark. I was sure Agata would be running her machine throughout the night, and I was right. The angel and Pierrot didn‚Äôt act any differently than before; I was disappointed, I had expected them to jump off the wall and embrace me. All I could do was continue holding the earpiece to my scalp, for Agata to continue pumping. There was a jar of plum jam left over from my last visit, viscid because the cap hadn‚Äôt been put back on properly. We ate it from the jar with our fingers, the earpiece increasingly sticky as we passed it between us.

 

‚ÄòFaster! Move it faster!‚Äô I screamed, Mr Magnolia disappearing as quickly as he appeared, his image not fully formed, his head oddly squished and wobbly.

 

I barely focused on my angel when he appeared, so keen to see him a second time. ‚ÄòC‚Äômon, again!‚Äô I screamed as he was pulled back into the lantern. I kicked away my little chair, sat on Agata‚Äôs lap and put my foot over hers, adding pressure. My foot was much smaller, it didn‚Äôt make her go any faster, but she put her free arm around my waist and held me there, and the earpiece passed seamlessly between us. The angel and Pierrot became stronger, more flamboyant in their actions. The angel imitated the obscene crotch-grabbing of Mr Magnolia, and I was so thrilled that at first I did not hear my father shouting in the hall. I did not hear him until he had grabbed me, and was carrying me away, and only then I noticed that my legs and arms and nightdress were covered in jam, so dark it could have been blood. Perhaps my father imagined it was.

 

At home, my mother bathed me, calling me disgusting over and over again, while I moaned, a strange, deep sound I had never made before. I did not go to school the next day; I did not go to that school ever again. I suffered from horrible visions: Agata‚Äôs lips, Mr Magnolia‚Äôs crotch, jars of jam with bits and pieces of sewing machines hidden inside that I choked on, they tasted like metal and licorice. I kicked and screamed and threw up, and was kept in my room for months.

 

When I could get out of bed, I was sent to stay with my aunt in the city. My parents sold the shop and joined me a few months later. By then I was so integrated into my aunt‚Äôs exciting city life that our village, and my entire childhood, was a blur I was embarrassed to remember.

 

My aunt took me to restaurants, bookshops, department stores, markets and the cinema. She was a professor, and though she lived alone, she had many male friends. I became fond of one, Leopold. He was much older than me. He had a raspberry-coloured birthmark on his cheek and wore very tiny, round spectacles. I kept in touch with him throughout my schooling, and married him when I started university. Our son inherited his father‚Äôs gigantic nose, which depressed Leopold sometimes, as his nose was full of cruel, bitter memories like an old heart, but I liked it. They both made me think of crows with their feathers painted pink.

 

I found work as an archivist and often looked for Agata‚Äôs name in catalogues and newspapers, but I found no trace of her. I assumed she‚Äôd gone abroad, perhaps took on a different name to fit in better. It was hard to return to our country, and I felt bad for her parents, who had put so much effort into supporting her, most likely getting nothing in return.

 

I still suffered, a little. I couldn‚Äôt stand any sort of apparatus. Leopold once gave me a music box shaped like a theatre with a dancing paper Pierrot inside. It made me so nervous I had to run to the bathroom and vomit. I couldn‚Äôt even hang a mobile above our son‚Äôs crib because of the shadows it would project across his nursery walls.

 

I hated the microfilm readers at work, I avoided them as much as possible, and typewriters, which I used sparingly, always biting my tongue. I preferred to make handwritten labels and lists, and made sure my handwriting was neat and clear so my co-workers wouldn‚Äôt complain. My favourite things to work with were old manuscripts, so old I had to wear white gloves while handling them, manuscripts written on skin.

 

I couldn‚Äôt think about the way clothes were made, with those awful, black contraptions. I was drawn to expensive things described as ‚Äòhand woven‚Äô, ‚Äòhand knitted‚Äô; I loved the word ‚Äòhand‚Äô, its warm and soft connotations. I always imagined a chubby, pink child‚Äôs hand like my son‚Äôs, completely opaque ‚Äì no wiry veins showing underneath.

 

I hated anything that whirled, flickered, buzzed, clicked, clattered. Sometimes I had nightmares, beasts with scissor mouths, metal fan wings, a telephone receiver for eyes, metal pincers and cog wheels longing to touch me.

 

There aren‚Äôt any flattering photos of me. Cameras make me blink and shudder.

 

I still took great pleasure in food, with the exception of fish and jam. Fish did not seem natural, but mechanical somehow, perhaps because of their silver skins. I often had a dream in which Agata scooped out my flesh with a long spoon and stuffed it into fish skins made from silver satin and sewed the seams onto her machine. I was left as nothing but a pile of fake sardines, the satin damp from my flesh hidden inside, and a skeleton wearing my own hair as a wig.

 

For my birthday, Leopold always gave me cured ham legs, picked tongues and other gourmet meats, ones that resembled what they were, meat that hadn‚Äôt been minced, ground, pulverised.

 

When I was in my forties, I went back to our old village to visit a sick aunt who was too weak to travel to the city. I had the idea that I would also visit Agata‚Äôs mother, remembering the cruel way I used to laugh at her bald patches, her skinny limbs. I also suspected my parents had given her harsh words. I wanted to show her that she was forgiven, that really it wasn‚Äôt her fault. I would bring her flowers.

 

I looked for the old flower shop, it was gone, but there was a floral section in a large, new grocery store. I bought her a cheery orange bouquet.

 

The curtains in the first floor windows of their building were faded from the sun, and full of equally faded trinkets, like deteriorating daguerreotypes that took the interior life of the building with them as they crinkled and vanished, leaving nothing but a blank stone wall, an uninhabited ruin.

 

I was surprised to find anyone there. Agata‚Äôs mother answered their door.

 

She wore a turban made of ragged grey and black fabric, from which I surmised that she must be entirely bald underneath. She was even thinner than I remembered, and bent, like a rib bone. The apartment was free of children; they were all grown up by now. Instead there was an old man, huddled in a chair by the stove, giving off the same sopping smell as a toddler. I wondered how many of their children had left the town, how many had left our country, to which they could never return.

 

‚ÄòCome upstairs,‚Äô her mother said in a whisper, placing the flowers on the table. Agata‚Äôs father flared his nostrils, seeking the origin of the floral smell, and I realised that he was blind.

 

‚ÄòFrom the glass. His eyes were ruined by the glass,‚Äô Agata‚Äôs mother said, shuffling out. I followed her up the stairs. There was a distinctive mixture of aromas ‚Äì cabbages, shoe polish, mice, tobacco, old kitchen pipes, walnuts, smoked ham ‚Äì as if the stairwell was an accordion, and each step a key that released not a note, but a heavy spray of fragrance. It was the thought of being trapped in that wheezing, terrible contraption that made me hesitate, but Agata‚Äôs poor mother kept walking up, and so I followed. Strongest was a warm, waxy smell. It drowned out all the others in great, deep waves, and I had the sensation I was ascending towards a room full of thousands of burning tallow candles.

 

By the time I glimpsed the buttery light under the door, I knew what to expect, and my ears took in the flickering sound.

 

She sat in the same armchair. She was so fat that her eyes, which used to protrude, were sunk deep into the flesh of her face, as if they were drowning in the bluish purple bags below them. She was lumpy and frayed, like a cloth doll stuffed with too much wool. Unclean fleece, I thought, torn from an animal. Her brown hair was cut short, and was oily. I could see layers of dandruff flakes stuck to her hairline, glistening in the light of her lantern, like shards of broken glass among the wooden ruins of a building. In the centre was a bald spot; an unclean skylight, cracked like a boiled egg tapped with a spoon, but still solid.

 

‚ÄòThe angel hasn‚Äôt come back since you left. He is waiting for you,‚Äô she said, only half-looking at me and her mother, who whispered, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll bring you girls some coffee in a few hours,‚Äô and left.

 

My white collage on the wall had turned yellow. Scraps of fresh paper, mostly toilet roll, ribbons and a fridge door had been added. It resembled a frilled and bedraggled wedding dress, ill-preserved by its bride, worn over and over again, the sweat and sweetness of the wedding day covered in grey reproductions of itself, the stains of a day relived over and over. I imagined the attic as one of the arched hollows under the bride‚Äôs arm, the place where the body leaves its imprint on fabric most intensely, those pathetic, damp and silent mouths of the heart.

 

My old chair was very small, it hurt my back, the earpiece was greasy, but I felt behind it that strange piece of flesh, that mysterious ear listening to me. Once more my winged man appeared, wearing the same appealing wide-wool trousers, the same lipstick, and I thought, he‚Äôs feigning cheery indifference, he is yellowed and worn by my absence",1,1731576611.0,RSbookclub,0,1.0,False
1gr13yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1gr13yo/advice_from_llm_for_bar_exam/,Advice from LLM for bar exam ,"Hi guys, 
A little late post but I wanted to write this in hopes that it may be helpful for someone. I scored 341/400 in NY and since this is really a good score, I wanted to share my journey because this platform was really helpful for me. I was an LLM, it was my first time in the US, my English is good but of course I am not native, and I had no prior knowledge of US law or common law since I am from a civil law jurisdiction. Also in my LLM year, I took courses related to my own practice area (antitrust and regulation) and only took Corporations and Information Privacy as bar exam courses. Neither was helpful for the bar exam. In fact, I learned more about 4th amendment in the famous breaking bad van scene than information privacy law.

Anyway, I started studying on May 20. I lost couple of days not studying but I tried to something everyday. Even if the most of the day was gone, I still looked at something. So, I never said, unlike some people, ‚ÄúI will always take Saturdays off‚Äù. My days were barely as effective as I would hope. I was distracted easily and had a very bad sleeping schedule. Often, I slept at 3 am (but often stopped studying around 1.30) and woke up at 2 pm and started studying at 3 and was really demotivated because all my friends in library had already studied in the morning, ate their lunch etc. So, I often studied in corners because when I saw people studying, I felt like I was not doing well enough. 

I could not also manage doing sports or socializing, not that I spent all my time studying but I have never been a good work-life balancer. I can lose time on surfing in Insta when book are open but cannot go outside or work out But that is my problem. One important thing is I did not drink. Even when hanging with people, I drank ice tea or coffee. This was like a promise to myself and was easy for me cause I am not a frequent drinker but I think it helped with memory.

Anyway, the reason I wrote all this, I studied but in my own way. There were times when I compared myself with others, I felt like I was not studying right but then I decided to trust my own methods and schedule. 

In terms of how I studied, I did Themis. When I first started I was reading the long outlines carefully but then of course never did it after a point but I tried to read and sometimes re-read the short outlines. I listened to the lectures and filled out blanks but really fast. Because some professors were really boring. I made sure that I did as much questions as possible both Themis questions and UWorld questions. I copied and pasted expalanatios and tables to a document for each subject, never read that document of course but while doing that I believe I internalized it. I think what I did that was most important was doing all UWorld questions, marking the weird ones and resolving them and taking notes while doing so. Sometimes I even drew the charts myself on paper, never looked at these notes ever but while solving questions I tried to study and understand. Sometimes I was reading the explanations out loud. I think this is the most important part.

For mee, I did as much questions as I can that was available on NY website or Themis. I also wrote down answers to a paper and made my own outlines, again never read these notes later (most of the time lost them on that day) but I took a lot of notes while reading answers/ explanations. I think the Goat materials on Reddit were really helpful. I understood disgusting wills, trust, and whatever else with these outlines. 

For mpt, I tried to practice as much as possible and recieved feedbacks. I think MPT is important. My MEE and MPT score was around 180 and I believe I did well on MPT because I practiced. It is easy points if you got it right and might pass you or fail you.

I think this year‚Äôs exam was weird. Some of the MEE questions were not what was highlighted in MEE materials but rather some rules in the sidelines explanations of some weird MBE questions. So, I think it is also important to study MBE, especially solving questions and reading explanations, in a perspective that this can also appear on MEE no matter how stupid detail it may look like.

That is all from me! I think this exam is hard but not harder than trying to study for it. I thought I would fail, did not really care because I am practicing back home, but still haunted my dreams. It is difficult but you got this. Just rely on yourself and your methods and study while taking notes, don‚Äôt just overlook! ",1,1731576606.0,barexam,0,1.0,False

This one girl is sitting in front of me she is looking toward me while drinking coffee. There was something magnetic about her, though I couldn‚Äôt quite place it,her eyes met mine for just a second‚Äîlong enough for me to feel a flicker of something. I turned back to my coffee, not thinking much of it. She called waiter I don‚Äôt know why I noticed it then, but her voice was different from the usual. It had a softness to it, a weariness that suggested she carried more than her. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a conversation that day. In fact, I was trying to avoid people. But when the barista accidentally dropped a cup near my table, it startled me, and in my effort to help, I knocked over my coffee, spilling it across the table.

""Need some help?"" The voice was soft again, and I looked up to find her standing by my table.

""Need some help?"" The voice was soft again, and I looked up to find her standing by my table.

She sat down across from me without asking, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. I didn‚Äôt stop her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Aakritii‚Äù she said, extending a hand.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù I replied, shaking it. I was surprised...

For a moment, we didn‚Äôt speak. The rain outside and cafe music, it was just the two of us, two strangers who had met by accident. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem like the type to come here often,‚Äù she finally said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I admitted and I say like it here people are not disturbing.

She nodded slowly, her eyes,then without warning, she stood up.‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you to it. I didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt your peace,‚Äù she said.

It was like the fog in my mind cleared for just a second, and in that moment, I realized I didn‚Äôt want her to leave.‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I called out, standing up. ‚ÄúDo you want to‚Äîdo you want to talk?‚Äù

She turned to face me,then she smile‚ÄúSure. But not here.‚Äù

And she gave her number and leave with sweetest smile. Over the next few weeks, I saw her every few days, always at the same cafe. At first, the conversation was casual‚Äîabout the weather, the city, our jobs‚Äîbut soon it became more personal. I learned about her life. And one day she wants to meet in some new place. It's about 5 6 in the evening we went to river side walk along the shore watching sunset together.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different tonight,‚Äù I said quietly.

She looked up at me, and for the first time, I saw something vulnerable in her eyes.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can keep doing this,‚Äù she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep pretending it doesn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù she took long breath and say she use to be prostitute for and years.

When she says that it was like earth is destroying in front of me. she grab my arms and says sorry for hiding this from me for this long. I wanted to ask her how she could do it, how she could give pieces of herself to strangers night after night, but I didn‚Äôt. She cry for a moment and says sorry for hurting my feelings. After an hour of that she kisses my arm and says if you love me i would leave this all and dedicate all my life to you. At that moment I didn't says anything move to my house and cut of connection with her and stop going that cafe for a week. Randomly after a week got a call from her. I didn't pick a call and went to that cafe and she was already there and the cafe barista came to me and says "" long time no see i thought you two got breakup"" i fake smile and says for a week . I walked past her and seat across her table. 

She came to me for a moment, she couldn‚Äôt speak.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I can be what you need,‚Äù she said quietly, looking down at hands.

I'm not answering .

She says she wants to begin her new life with be and dedicate her life to me.

I‚Äôve been friends with this guy, let‚Äôs call him Pete, for over eight years now. I had a feeling he had feelings for me all along, but he always denied them. I have a very messed up background in terms of my upbringing and I have attachment issues. However, because I used to perform in theatre plays, I am good at keeping a very healthy and confident appearance.

I went through a bunch of horrible relationships which he helped me through. One of which ended pretty bad and put me in a very bad mental space, and I‚Äôm talking depression and anxiety here. I ended up one day crying at his door and I didn‚Äôt leave for five months. I slept on his sofa. To help me get better, he diverted my attention to some training around AI which ultimately shaped my career into what it is today. I did a Masters which he helped me with and he also helped me get my first job. Because of his help during my Master‚Äôs I got a scholarship and got accepted for a PhD too.

We developed this weirdly close friendship where I would not date a guy unless he would approve of him. We moved in together and we did absolutely everything together. But before you ask, no we never slept together or kissed.

well, due to my past, my anxiety and my romantic history, I developed this sort of codependent relationship with him where I would get very jealous and panicky when he would date someone. Don‚Äôt get me wrong there were some girls that I really liked and I actually encouraged him to do well with them. But I would always need reassurance that he will not leave me if those girls get jealous over our friendship. 

Well, one day he moved jobs and he met this little girl. Let‚Äôs call her Catherine.  He had a crush on her for a few weeks and he asked her out. Catherine told him that she‚Äôs in a relationship but she said she‚Äôs still down to hang out if he wants to. As I am aware of my clinginess, I tried not to say anything even though in my head I already saw this as cheating. I want to mention that him and I live with my boyfriend and my dog. My boyfriend and I are pretty serious. We‚Äôre talking about getting engaged soon. 

Well, he starts hanging out more and more with this Catherine. He starts going hiking with her. He goes to her birthday party. He stays out late during the week which is very unlike him. He‚Äôs usually very introverted. It starts hurting me but not in a way of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to hang with her anymore‚Äù. It hurts me more in a ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt talk at all anymore‚Äù. 

One day he brings her home but before that he insists on asking me to be nice. That already offends me because I‚Äôve always been nice to everyone, including many of his friends that cannot stand me, and his mother who never made it a secret that she hated me.

Well the whole time the chick is there she only talks to my boyfriend and him. Eventually I break the silence between me and her. I start asking her about herself and I noticed that she is weirdly similar to me which I find creepy. She does a few sort of things like trying to reach for something on the coffee table and brushing her breast against his shoulder or grabbing my dog toys from between his legs? I start feeling uncomfortable so I get my dog and my boyfriend and we‚Äôre going to my room to watch a movie. Six hours past and she hasn‚Äôt left yet, my dog wants to pee so I going to the living room to get my dogs lead. Of course that I see him lying backwards between her legs when I go into the living room. She was allegedly giving him a massage üôÑ.

I asked my boyfriend if I‚Äôm being crazy and he says ‚Äúno she‚Äôs weird and this is weird‚Äù. This whole thing is just strange. I wait until the next day and I tell him that I do not approve of this girl that to me it seem like she came here just to assert dominance over me as a best friend. I warn him that she is trying to make him a side piece. He said that‚Äôs not true and I ask him if she still with her boyfriend. He says yes, and I say then that‚Äôs what you are.

Weeks go by and he never really mentioned her again. I can tell they hang out a lot, though. One day he asked me to go into his room to check the shopping he‚Äôs done for his sister‚Äôs wedding. In the meantime, he takes my dog out. When I enter the room, I see his laptop open on a conversation with her and I can‚Äôt help myself and scroll through it and I see extremely inappropriate things. I am fully aware that I shouldn‚Äôt have gone through his messages and I do not try to hide it. The second he comes through the door with my dog, I confront him and I tell him ‚ÄúI look through your messages. I‚Äôm sorry, and I promise we can deal with that next‚Ä¶ but this is not okay. What is happening?‚Äù He says it‚Äôs just playful banter and nothing happened between them and I ask him is she still with her boyfriend. He says yes and I say to him ‚ÄúI beg you don‚Äôt do this, you‚Äôve been cheated on, you know what it feels like. Don‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶  if she‚Äôs not picking you as a main boyfriend she‚Äôs not in this for a relationship, she‚Äôs playing with you, she needs the validation. Don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù He gets angry with me and says that it‚Äôs unacceptable that I went through his messages. 

From that point on we‚Äôve never spoken. It‚Äôs been six months. Four weeks after the incident he moved out completely, he never said goodbye. He never said anything. I don‚Äôt know where he moved. I don‚Äôt know who he lives with but he blocked me on WhatsApp a few weeks ago too. We had a couple of theatre plays and concerts booked together and he didn‚Äôt show up. He gave his tickets to her so she showed up with her boyfriend. 

I do feel bad that I lost my best friend and frankly he‚Äôs been invaluable in my life. I owe my career to him. He‚Äôs taken care of me when I was sick. He used to buy me flowers weekly and telling me that no man deserves me. He used to be absolutely amazing, amazing. And I know I am in the wrong here for having gone through his messages and I know that the bigger reason on why I didn‚Äôt want him to go for this girl was because I was afraid of losing him and I wasn‚Äôt ready. But there‚Äôs a big part of me that never really wanted to fix this. I let him go because every time we fought I had to be the one patching things up. And also I let him go because he‚Äôs promised me that no woman will never break our friendship and this is exactly what he let happen.

He was like my brother to me. My family and my boyfriend loved him like my brother. But in retrospective regardless of what he said, my mum believes that he was in love with me all this time. She thinks he made a calculated decision to get over me when he realise that my boyfriend and I are very serious and that me trying to block him from finding a rebound really triggered him and led to this fallout. My dad thinks this was preempted and that it‚Äôs his mother‚Äòs doing because she could never stand me. There‚Äôs a long story on why but it‚Äôs basically his mother never understood why I never wanted to date him or call him my boyfriend. No matter how much him and I denied being romantically involved, she was convinced that we are sleeping together while I am calling other men ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù (kinda what Catherine was doing). Also his mother saw him as being lazy and saw me as being opportunistic. She always got an annoyed that I got ahead of the game with his help. For example, she tried to talk me out of getting into a PhD, and once she found out that I actually got accepted on a scholarship, she told me that anyone gets accepted for a PhD nowadays, in front of my mum who has 3 of them and knows how hard it is.

So I miss him and yes, I was wrong but I am an asshole for letting things just play out and never apologising or trying to fix this? I guess the biggest ‚Äúouch‚Äù is that I never got to pay him back for all he did for me‚Ä¶ and I really wanted to. ",0,1731576118.0,AITAH,9,0.4,False

Today, some construction workers arrived to our house and they began working in my room. I work from home, and I moved my laptop in the kitchen. I could tell that my mom was frustrated since the moment she woke up, because she was ranting about something all morning, but I tried not to pay much attention while drinking coffee. I just let her blow out some steam. And that was a mistake I made.

Then we both began talking about some things, and she got increasingly angry at me. Like she started clinging onto any word that I was saying, and blowing it out of context, without allowing me to explain myself. Obviously, I shut ddown. Ever since being a kid I have a terrible trauma of everyone fighting around me, and this puts me on the edge. But and also because there were other people at the house. I don't want them to be eavesdropping. 

This did not stop her. She didn't like it that I was not responding to her. I even told her a couple of times to tone it down, because there are other people at home, and that this is wrong of her. She kept pushing and pushing me with some of the comments that she was making. I remained silent. I won't go into any details about what she said to me, but it was terrible. And I let myself cry for a bit after she left. At this point she was saying anything to get a reaction out of me. 

It topped all off with her raising her voice and screaming at me, calling me ungrateful, and how I don't appreciate her. I remained mute and kept everything to myself. It lasted for an over hour before she got an important phone call and then finally went to work.  My stepdad told me that while I was not entirely in the wrong, he told me to give her a call and apologize for her actions. While I understand where he is coming from, I feel like that she overstepped my boundaries when she caused a scene in front of so many people at home. I feel incredibly humiliated and I wish there was a way to apologize to these men for what they had to hear. 

I would like an advice on what to do next. How to talk to her, and how should I handle it a bit better. And also please don't tell me to move out. I know what I need to do. I just don't have the finances to do it now. ",2,1731576110.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

This is around 2nd week ng August.

Hindi ko pa agad sya nirereplyan, kaso biglang nangulit sya. So I entertained na. We talked everyday nag cacall sya sa morning and bago kami matulog it became a constant thing. Lumipat kami ng messenger mag usap September 5. Walang nagbago. Lumalabas na rin kami coffee dates and quick dinner after ng trabaho ko. Hanggang sa nagkakaroon na kami ng mga away kasi nawawala yung communication ( di na sya nsg uupdates like before). Nagpadala pa sya ng flowers sa office para maayos yung misunderstandings (masyadong matindi galit ko dito kasi nag lie sya na may cancer sya para di ko itigil ).
 naiintindihan ko naman na busy sa trabaho,kasi ako din naman. ang gusto ko lang kahit simple text na magiging busy kami today chat ako pag kauwi ko galing work. Na meet ko na yung mga ka work nya and nakausap ko na isang tita nya cinonfirm na binata sya. 

So ayun last Tuesday morning inis pa din ako kasi nagkasagutan kami nung gabi dahil sa communication na naman and sabi nya gusto nya na maganak. Single mom ako, sa financial status naming dalawa alam kong di pa afford mag baby. 8-10k sahod nya 14k + saakin. Mahal daw nya ko pero mag 30 na sya gusto na nya ng anak and kasal. Kako pag financially stable na. Naging okay kami for an hour biglang tumahimik sya while on call and asked na itigil na lahat. Napapagod na daw sya sa little arguments. Napansin ko agad na may mali. So tinawagan ko sya ng tinawagan, yun pala may nabuntis ng iba. 3days after nilang mag churva tyaka nya ko daw pinursue kasi ginghost sya nung babae after may mangyari. Kaso buntis na daw yung babae ngayon so Sorry and makakahanap ka ng iba dyan sorry daw kung nasaktan nya ko and wala na syang pake sa kahit ano ngayon masaya at excited lang sya sa magiging anak nya.

Based sa GA and EDD nung babae totoong kanya nga (before or during MU namin nabuo) and yung clinic na pinag pa check upan nung babae walking distance sa kanila. 

Blocked na rin sya sa lahat ng socmed ko pero di na naman ako makakain at makatulog ng maayos.


 Gusto ko lang mag kwento kasi sobrang sakit.  3 years After naming maghiwalay ng tatay ng anak ko ngayon lang ulit ako nag tiwala tapos ganito na naman. Nag vivideocall or call naman kami pag nakauwi sys or nasa bahay na sya. Na confirm ko din sa tita nya kaya nagtiwala na ko.

I just wanted to share my journey as i found reading other ladies journey super insightful! 

- 34 yrs old
- AMH 2.7 
- First clinic‚Äôs follicle count: 10 (somehow they did it NOT during my period and they said it is okay) 
- Second clinic‚Äôs follicle count :15 (did ultrasound on my second day of period. Decided to go with this clinic)

- Total egg count at retrieval : 35
- Total matured&frozen : 19

10/30
Ultrasound + blood work 

11/2~11/6
Stimulation started
- gonal ff 200 IU
- menopur 150 IU

11/6 ultrasound+bloodwork

11/8
Ultrasound+blood work (total follicle counts 15)
- cetrotide 1 vial (morning exactly at 8:25am) 
- gonal 175 IU 
- menopur 150 IU

11/9
- gonal 100 IU (accidentally put 175 IU)
- menopur 150 IU
- cetrotide 1 vial (morning exactly at 8:25am) 

I started to be constipated and recommended to take milk of magensia and miralex.
However, i didnt have bowel movement even after retrieval since this day.

11/10 
- gonal 75 IU (doctor changed from 100 to 75 because i put a wrong dose)
- menopur 150 IU
- cetrotide 1 vial (morning exactly at 8:25am) 

11/11 (trigger day)
Ultrasound + bloodwork (total follicle counts 25!!)
- cetrotide 1 vial (morning exactly at 8:25am) 
- lupron (leuprolide, triggershot) 80 units at 1am
- cabergoline 1 tablet at night

11/12 (day before ER) 
- blood work 
- doxycycline (1tablet, twice a day in breakfast&dinner) 
- lupron (leuprolide, triggershot) 80 units at 1pm (12 hrs after first trigger)
- cabergoline 1 tablet at night
- letzropole (2 tablets at bedtime) 
- no drinking or food 8 hours before ER


11/13 ER at 1pm
- took 1000 mg of tylenol at 12pm
- retrieval started at 1pm and woke up around at 2pm
- i had cramps, backache, and super bloated.
- i couldnt pee so i waited extra hour (which could be emergency) so doctor did ultrasound scan of my bladder. Fortunately i was just super dehydrated
- i feel fine after few hours but super bloated and still constipated with minor cramps
- cabergoline 1 tablet at night (for another three days)
- doxycycline (for another four days)
- letzropole (2 tablets at bedtime) 


I found out that first clinic prescribed much higher dosage of stimulations based on the 10 follicle counts and second clinic pointed out that it is not accurate and could result in OHSS so the second clinic was skeptical about the first clinic‚Äôs data. 

Second clinic said they want to freeze at least 15 mature eggs due to general probability and i might have to do second round. However, my eggs grew healthy and much more than expected so i wont need another round (i also feel okay with 19)

For supplements, I started taking the following for 2.5months 
- Prenatal vitamin that has 800mcg follic acid,
- 2000 IU vitamin D
- Coq10 400mg
- Probiotic
- Fish oil
- vitamin C

And i cut coffee (i usually drink 3 a day. I didnt even drink decaf during stim) alcohol and tried to eat healthy
I didnt really exercise

Overall, i am super happy about the result and journey was also somewhat fun! Self injecting was scary first but i got used to it

I also iced my belly while i was mixing the medicine.




Biggest thing i realized throughout this journey:
- how little i know about female‚Äôs body
- how little we are taught about how our body works and how feeling emotions, pain, etc is tremendously hard work and not easy
- how little we talk about our body
- how being a woman is freaking hard and sometimes sucks! 
- how women deserve more in this world
- how us women need to support, advocate, and take care of each other
- how all of us who has gone through this process or thinking about it, are all freaking brave, courageous, deserve the best, and empowering

1gr0vnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gr0vnt/choosing_the_perfect_coffee_table_for_your_living/,Choosing the Perfect Coffee Table for Your Living Room,"The coffee table is often the centerpiece of a living room, bringing together both style and functionality. It anchors your seating area, offers space for decor, and provides a convenient spot for drinks, snacks, and books. With so many shapes, materials, and styles to choose from, picking the right coffee table can feel overwhelming. Here‚Äôs a guide to help you select the perfect coffee table for your living room, and a few tips on incorporating side tables and even outdoor coffee tables for a cohesive design.

**1. Consider the Space and Layout**

The first thing to consider when choosing a [coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) is the layout and size of your living room. A coffee table that‚Äôs too large can make the room feel cramped, while one that‚Äôs too small may not serve your needs. Ideally, your coffee table should be about two-thirds the length of your sofa. There should be enough space around it (at least 18 inches) to move comfortably and access seating.

For smaller living rooms, opt for a round or oval coffee table, which takes up less space and allows for better flow. In larger living rooms, a rectangular or square table can create a more defined seating area. If you have an open-concept layout, pairing a coffee table with matching [side tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables) can help visually connect your seating areas, giving the space a unified feel.

 **2. Choose a Style that Complements Your Decor**

Coffee tables come in a wide range of styles, so choosing one that complements your existing decor is essential. For a modern, minimalist look, opt for a coffee table with clean lines and a simple finish, like metal or glass. If you prefer a rustic or bohemian vibe, a wooden table with a textured finish or unique shape can add warmth and character to the space. 

For an eclectic style, mixing materials is a great way to create visual interest. Consider a coffee table that combines wood and metal, or a glass top with a rattan or wicker base. Adding side tables in a matching or complementary style can also enhance your design, giving you extra surface area and creating a layered, cohesive look.

**3. Think About Functionality**

When choosing a coffee table, it‚Äôs important to consider how you plan to use it. Do you need extra storage? Look for a coffee table with built-in drawers or a lower shelf where you can store books, magazines, and remotes. For those who entertain frequently, a sturdy table that can withstand drinks, snacks, and the occasional spill is a practical choice.

If your coffee table will serve multiple purposes, consider an option that‚Äôs versatile, like a nesting coffee table set. These tables can be arranged in various configurations or separated for additional surface area when needed. [Outdoor coffee tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables), often designed with weather-resistant materials like teak, metal, or rattan, are also a great option for busy households because they are durable and easy to maintain. While they‚Äôre built to withstand the elements, many outdoor coffee tables offer the same stylish look as indoor options and can be seamlessly integrated into a living room for a unique, functional twist.

**4. Match Materials with Your Lifestyle**

Material choice is a crucial factor when selecting the perfect coffee table. Wooden tables bring warmth and natural beauty to the room, with finishes that range from light oak to dark walnut. However, they may require regular maintenance to prevent scratching. If you prefer something low-maintenance, glass coffee tables are a stylish option that gives the illusion of more space. Just be mindful of fingerprints and smudges‚Äîthis style may require more frequent cleaning if you have young children.

For a durable, easy-care option, consider a metal or stone coffee table. These materials work well in industrial or contemporary spaces and are less prone to wear and tear. Outdoor coffee tables, made with materials like metal or durable synthetic wicker, are a great choice for high-traffic areas or homes with pets, as they resist stains and scratches. Their unique texture and weathered look also add a relaxed, lived-in vibe to any living room.

**5. Don‚Äôt Forget to Accessorize**

Once you‚Äôve chosen your coffee table, styling it with a few carefully selected accessories can enhance its appeal. Start with a decorative tray to corral smaller items like candles, coasters, or remotes. Add a stack of books or magazines, a small plant, or a piece of art to give the table personality. Side tables are a great addition to your coffee table setup as they provide extra space for more decor elements and add functionality.

If your living room opens up to an outdoor space, consider a matching outdoor coffee table for your patio or balcony. This creates a seamless transition from indoors to outdoors and encourages flow between spaces. Outdoor coffee tables, often designed to be lightweight and easy to move, can also be pulled indoors temporarily if you‚Äôre entertaining and need extra surface area.

**6. Mix and Match with Side Tables for Versatility**

Pairing your coffee table with side tables can add versatility to your living room. Side tables placed next to armchairs or on either side of the sofa provide convenient spots for drinks, lamps, or additional decor. Matching or coordinating side tables create a sense of balance, while choosing a different style or shape can introduce an interesting contrast. Nesting side tables are particularly useful for smaller spaces, as they offer flexibility and can be tucked away when not in use.

Choosing the perfect coffee table for your living room is all about balancing style, function, and personality. Whether you prefer a minimalist glass table, a rustic wood design, or a durable outdoor coffee table, the right choice will enhance both the look and functionality of your space. Don‚Äôt be afraid to mix and match with side tables to create a complete, inviting living room setup. With these tips in mind, you‚Äôll be able to find a coffee table that fits your lifestyle, complements your decor, and becomes the perfect centerpiece for your living room.

I have posted a very raw ad before, which I can summarize that I am looking for a  'boyfriend experience' of an affair. However, the responses I got were endless d*** pics and men wanting to meet up at hotels. None panned out of course. I was not interested to be anyone's business trip hook-up that will only be together in a hotel room cause ""My colleagues hang out at the lobby"".

Again the purpose of me trying to find an AP is to meet a guy who will love me, carry a good conversation, be my soulmate and make my heart feel full and secure. Of course the sex will be there and it will be great but I don't want to be in an affair just for hooking up. I want to go dancing with him. I want to travel with him. I wanna do mundane things like cook or read a book and discuss it with him or    go through Netflix without even watching anything and just commenting to the cover picture. 

I'm reading here that there are lots of you that found a soulmate in your AP and I am rooting for you. At the same time I feel like I'm so worthless that I'm stuck with a horrible and dangerous marriage and no decent guy even want to have coffee with me. 


As of late, a previous AP and a few previous PAPs have magically come out of the woodwork and texting me if I wanna meet up. I kept things platonic with the previous AP and I know if I meet the previous PAPs it will end up just for sex. Even after explaining my situation to them the conclusion derived is ""So do you wanna come over to my place today?"" and I recall why they are mere PAPs in the first place. 

Am I not worthy of a dinner?? Outside of my shitty marriage I am doing better than most with decent looks, well educated and in c-suite yet I'm such a loser in when it comes to men. I ask myself everyday what is wrong with me that I have a horrible abusive SO and no other men want me for anything other than sex.

My question:  Is seeking an AP to fulfill the emotional & mental hole wrong? Should I get a divorce first, be a single person and only then I'm eligible for this? Do note that I'm in my 40s so the dating pool is probably very small. ",1,1731575178.0,u_Conscious-Survey-626,0,1.0,False

The following morning the pair of us met up before our first class in the school courtyard.

Eldid was quick to make an appearance as everyone witnessed us cuddling up to one another and laughing together. His face darkened when he saw me.¬†

‚ÄòTristrian,‚Äô he said curtly.¬†

‚ÄòNice to see you too,‚Äô I told him.¬†

He looked like he was going to make a snide remark, but Desdemona cut in first. ‚ÄòScrew you, Eldid,‚Äô she snapped. ‚ÄòTristrian is off limits. Remember?‚Äô

‚ÄòSister, please,‚Äô he said with a meaningful look between her and me.

‚ÄòYou have a lot of brazenness speaking to me after what you did,‚Äô she accused. ‚ÄòWhat you wouldn‚Äôt even admit to!‚Äô¬†

Desdemona turned to me. She took my hands and then encircled her arms around my neck. She kissed me.

‚ÄòCome on, kiss me back,‚Äô she whispered, pulling away a little bit. And I did.¬†

As we parted, she met Eldid‚Äôs stare. Eldid said nothing. Dionysia, who‚Äôd just joined him, took him by the arm and led him away wordlessly.¬†

A surprising number of students took note of the exchange. This included some of my friends, who approached me as Eldid and Dionysia left.¬†

Enid clapped her hands together and gave me a big smile. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so glad to see you back together again!‚Äô she cried.¬†

Ronnie shared his enthusiasm. ‚ÄòI get the feeling everyone is going to be whispering about you for a while. Again.‚Äô He looked like he wanted to say more but right then the bell rang and the surrounding students began to disperse off across the courtyard.

Desdemona ultimately succeeded in exposing what Dionysia and Eldid had tried with me, as she explained during a warm evening meander through the Italian Plaza.¬†¬†

‚ÄòEsther would likely have figured the truth herself in short order. She knew the two of them were hiding something,‚Äô she explained.

‚ÄòYou know what infuriates me though? Esther was mad about them for being stupid and careless. She hardly cared about the possibility of you being killed, or Nailah either. She was disappointed in them for their disobedience.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòShe approves of my relationship with you about as much as they do. I actually wonder if Desdemona tried what she did partly to please our mother. It just sucks.‚Äô

She sighed as I massaged her back. ‚ÄòI guess at least she is mad at them. She‚Äôs as angry as I‚Äôve ever seen her. Dionysia and Eldid are going to have a hard time winning back her affection. You should try to stay away from them, though.‚Äô¬†

Her eyes darkened. ‚ÄòI wish there was some way for me to‚Ä¶ Make them understand the *awfulness* of what they tried. They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to get away with this!‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea for Desdermona to lash out at her siblings. I expressed my concern to her and found her unreceptive. Whatever she was planning to do, she‚Äôd already made up her mind about it.¬†

‚ÄòWhatever you do, please be careful,‚Äô I asked. ‚ÄòPromise me.‚Äô¬†

She did. She sounded somewhat earnest. I worried for her, but I knew there wasn‚Äôt much I could do. Desdemona had made it clear more than once I wasn‚Äôt to interfere with her handling of family matters.¬†

With her being more open about everything, I managed to get Desdemona to explain how the supernatural side of things worked for the Volkovs.

‚ÄòMy family made a pact with a demon called Cambion well over a thousand years ago. That part you know. It is why we‚Äôre so powerful,‚Äô she continued. ‚ÄòAnd beautiful, and lucky, and strong and all the rest. It's all part of the blessing he provides us with.‚Äô

‚ÄòEach of us lives well over a century - though some longer than others. Normann? I believe he‚Äôs over two hundred years old. My mother, too. They don‚Äôt like sharing their real ages to me. In fact, they won‚Äôt speak of their lives at all past a couple decades ago.‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat about the patriarch? How old is he?‚Äô I wanted to know.¬†

‚ÄòUm - I‚Äôd guess at least twice my mothers age.‚Äô ‚Äò

Four hundred years old?‚Äô I repeated. ‚ÄòWow.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòAs we grow older we grow more powerful. We do age and die - some of us more quickly than others. It depends on how frequently and fervently we worship Cambion, and how much he personally favors us. The Patriarch tends to live the longest.‚Äô

Desdemona admitted she didn‚Äôt like the sound of living so much longer than everyone else.¬†

‚ÄòI want to be normal, like everyone else,‚Äô she complained. ‚ÄòAnd I know I‚Äôm never going to have a shot at a normal life if I go on living twice as long as everyone else does.‚Äô

Her words made me hopeful. They provided me with something I could use to persuade her to free herself her curse.¬†

‚ÄòTristrian. Can we talk?‚Äô¬†

I froze. I was sitting outside a coffee shop in the Italian Quarter, enjoying the afternoon sun while I deliberated over an English assignment on my laptop. Emily had wanted to meet me to speak about something important which she wouldn‚Äôt discuss over the phone.¬†

‚ÄòI told you I suspected the Volkovs were involved in John‚Äôs death. And how I believe Normann was the one responsible for what happened.‚Äô¬†

I shut my laptop quietly, turning my full attention to her.¬†

‚ÄòIan was involved too. As it turns out, he played a part in our father‚Äôs murder and then helped cover it up.

I felt my hands tighten on the table. ‚ÄòHe did what?‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt want to believe it,‚Äô she continued. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve tried to find any evidence to prove the theory wrong. The more I looked, the more proof I found I was right, until there was no doubting it.¬†

She paused to tap a couple of times swiftly on her phone, then held it out to me.¬†

On the screen I saw an email. The name of the sender was a jumble of letters and numbers. The receiver I couldn‚Äôt identify.

‚ÄòI hacked into Ian‚Äôs mail account,‚Äô she said without preamble. ‚ÄòWhich is what you‚Äôre looking at right now.‚Äô

When I eyed her disapprovingly, she pushed the phone into my hands and instructed, ‚Äòjust read it, okay?‚Äô

The email was short and to the point:

*I've made it easy. You make sure he is at the right place at the right time. Check the back door is unlocked and the alarm is switched off. Then give the call to my friends and they‚Äôll take care of the rest. Got it?*

*By the way,*

*I‚Äôm not going to ask you nicely again.*¬†

‚ÄòHe‚Äôs worked his way into Normann‚Äôs circle of elitist friends,‚Äô Emily explained. Her words were blunt and to the point. ‚ÄòHe may have started as a reluctant accomplice, but the money Normann offered him got to his¬†

head. Now he does whatever Normann wants.¬† They seem to have a good relationship.‚Äô

Our uncle had promised a better future for us in Avalon. He recommended Emily to the prestigious Samara University and offered her enough money to provide for her for the next couple years. For me the deal was similar. A nice school, a fresh start. He promised to support me financially with whatever education I desired after I graduated.¬†¬†

Ian was a withdrawn person, quiet and always busy with work. He respected my personal space and most of the time he let me do whatever I wanted. I can‚Äôt say I was very close to him, but besides Emily, he was the only real family I had left.¬†

After John‚Äôs murder, our uncle had changed. I sometimes wondered if he felt somehow responsible for our father‚Äôs death because of how reluctant he was to discuss anything about John after his passing.

‚ÄòAre you sure about this?‚Äô I asked.¬†

She replied immediately. ‚ÄòI am. I‚Äôll show you the other evidence if you want.‚Äô¬†

The other evidence was a bit to sift through. It included more communications between Normann and Ian, further proof tying these interactions back to Ian, and some conversations with someone else where Ian said some pretty awful and threatening things about my father.¬†

Put together, the evidence was convincing enough for me. I didn‚Äôt want to believe Emily, but what I saw was undeniable.

‚ÄòHe‚Äôs caught up in whatever Normann is planning. As a key player or a pawn in his schemes? I don't know.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòWhat is it you are going to do once you find proof?‚Äô I asked uneasily. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll take it to the police, right?‚Äô

‚ÄòHe will get what he deserves. I promise,‚Äô Emily assured me.¬†

‚ÄòBut he‚Äôs not the only one who has to pay,‚Äô she continued swiftly. ‚ÄòThe Volkovs are all evil. The world is a darker place with them in it. I intend to see their empire destroyed - every business they‚Äôve built in this town and everything of value to them.‚Äô

I shifted on the chair uncomfortably.¬†

‚ÄòThey‚Äôll all suffer,‚Äô Emily emphasized. ‚ÄòHim and Normann and the rest of them. Imurela is going to make sure of it.‚Äô

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre fine with working for him now?‚Äô I asked.¬†

She threw up her hands. ‚ÄòNo! I hate working for him. But I don‚Äôt have a choice. And don‚Äôt tell me you wouldn‚Äôt wish to see Ian and Normann face retribution for what they did to John.‚Äô

I sighed.¬†

‚ÄòWhat does the Goatman want you to do? Is he using you to hurt people?‚Äô I asked her.

She looked down unwillingly. ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt tell anyone that. He‚Äôs sworn me to secrecy.‚Äô

‚ÄòEmily -‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòHe promised me once the Volkovs are dealt with, our deal is over and me and you can both leave this town forever. We‚Äôll start a new life somewhere else. All of this will be just another bad memory.‚Äô

She took one of my hands in hers and squeezed it tightly. ‚ÄòAll you have to do for now is keep this a secret.‚Äô¬†

We both fell silent for a while. Emily looked tired and a little scared. The more I examined her, the more her appearance perturbed me.¬†

‚ÄòEmily, please don‚Äôt hurt her.‚Äô

She didn‚Äôt have to ask who I was referring to.¬†

‚ÄòYou should stay away from her,‚Äô she told me.

‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not going to happen,‚Äô I said.¬†

Emily threw up her hands. ‚ÄòHow can you stick by her when you know what her family has done?¬†

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with you!‚Äô

‚ÄòShe‚Äôs just a kid.‚Äô

Her gaze made me tense. ‚ÄòGiven the deal they‚Äôve made they‚Äôre hardly *people* anymore, are they?‚Äô She asked cuttingly. ‚ÄòBesides, you have no idea what she‚Äôs done for them.‚Äô She added, ‚ÄòYou know, I suspect she‚Äôs been helping Esther gather dirt on people she can use to exploit them.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòI know Esther has questionable ways of doing business with people. I also know Desdemona doesn‚Äôt like or agree with her mother‚Äôs actions. She would never do that,‚Äô I told her.

‚ÄòI bet she would.‚Äô

‚ÄòBut you don‚Äôt know, do you? You don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs actually done anything?‚Äô

She sighed begrudgingly.

‚ÄòCome on. Just give her a chance,‚Äô I pleaded.¬†

‚ÄòNo. She‚Äôs one of them,‚Äô Emily repeated stubbornly.¬†

‚ÄòI won‚Äôt let you hurt her.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt stop me.‚Äô She clasped her hands together on the table. ‚ÄòAre you afraid I‚Äôll uncover something about her, something she‚Äôs done?‚Äô She leaned forward. ‚ÄòIf I do, and I expect I will, she‚Äôll pay for her sins with the rest of them.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre getting good,‚Äô Desdemona spoke breathlessly. It was one late afternoon and we were practicing fencing at the school gym. We were one of a number of regulars who sought to hone their skill to a more competitive level.¬†

It was one of the fights I thought I‚Äôd won. I let her lunge in on and force me toward the back of the miniature piste. In between two of her wild cuts I saw an opening and jumped forward to jab her in her chest.¬†

I pointed the saber at her, pressing it slightly into her torso.¬†

‚ÄòI win,‚Äô I said, and playfully asked, ‚Äòdo you surrender?‚Äô¬†

With her characteristic lightning quickness she danced out of the way of the blade. Then she turned my saber to the side with her own while dashing forward.¬†

The sword fell out of my hand. I looked down at it stupidly, and Desdemona pointed her saber at me.¬†¬†

‚ÄòOw. That was unfair,‚Äô I said as I rubbed my wrist.¬†

‚ÄòWe fight dirty,‚Äô Desdemona replied. ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre ever going to be part of my family, you must always remember that.‚Äô

Desdemona put her saber down and came over to me. She winced as she plucked up my hand and examined it. ‚ÄòSorry, that was a little too rough, I think. Are you okay?‚Äô¬†

I repeated her words to myself silently, my annoyance melting away.

1gr0nb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemonolatryPractices/comments/1gr0nb3/first_kissmust_have_been_good_coffee/,First Kiss...Must Have Been Good Coffee,"Well, I got quite a surprise yesterday.  To start things, I'd like to explain what happened last week. I had accidently skipped my medicine. The next day, I felt off but took my medicine normally. The day after that, I was out of my MAJOR medicine. Without it, I cannot function.  Of course, on top of that, you have the negativity of the election here in the States. A lot of people on my timeline were really depressed and scared. The people on my timeline who voted the other way, well, some of them were pretty rude and also negative. So, I was definitely already feeling the negativity and was trying to wait out the flood of it. So, med on top of that were just BLAAAAAARGH!

Anyway, needless to say, I got very cranky, agitated, super depressed, and began to feel hopeless. Most of this was due to my medicine being out of my system and me not having enough to correct the skip I did (the other negativity just kinda compounded with my already bad feelings). I was an absolute mess.

So, I was pleading for some relief of some kind, even just temporary or just a little. I was just so desperate for some help to feel a little better. Well, while I was getting the visits, I was unable to feel a connection with any of my normal demons. Stolas wasn't able to make me feel better despite him saying nice things. Lucifer, I couldn't feel a connection at all. Like, I knew he was close, but we just couldn't talk to each other. Asmodeus was trying to do his thing and cheer me up and it was BARELY able to do anything. I just felt so empty.

Anyway, I did get a refill of my big medication and got back on track and within a day I was already feeling SO much better, but I wasn't feeling the connection to Lucifer still. I was also feeling off with Stolas still. Maybe my energy was still real screwy or I dunno. It was just so weird. 

The other day, I got a special craving in the middle of the night and immediately thought of Stolas. While he didn't say anything directly, it felt like he wanted to bond over a treat. Yesterday, I had a doctor appointment to get some bloodwork and since I was out and had a little money, I decided to pick up breakfast (he wanted chicken nuggets but he settled for a McGriddle. Next week for my follow up, it'll be closer to lunch time, so we can do chicken nuggets). 

The big thing yesterday was that I wanted to get a mocha frappe. That was me and Lucifer's thing, and I really missed him and was still frustrated we couldn't connect. So, after getting my food, I took a moment to stop everything, focus, think of Lucifer, and I took a big sip of the frappe. The response was immediate. It sort of reminded me of someone trying to break in a door only to have someone open that door at the last minute. I just felt this desperate, passionate sensation on my mouth, like a passionate kiss. It was so shocking and I was left kinda frozen there for a moment since I hadn't expected that. I can't really figure out if he just got a little too intense since we were both trying to connect or if that intensity was intentional and he was really damn happy to get the offering/connect.

It was just left at that. He didn't say anything and I was just left a little confused. When I got home, we just experienced the rest of my breakfast in calm silence, but I definitely felt him there. It wasn't the warm, fuzzy feeling that he normally brings, but something a little more...I don't really know how to explain it. Like, he was very adamant I was NOT supposed to go to sleep (which is normally the opposite of his normal energy, which relaxes me and often eases me into a nap). It just felt very much like a ""Don't go anywhere. Just stay here."" I've just never experienced anything like that before and it does confuse me a little bit.

To be fair, I have been flirty with Lucifer, but I just never considered him interested, since he never really responded to the flirts. Our intimacy was usually him sharing his warm and calming energy or letting me stroke his hands. I'm just not quite sure what to do with this one and he hasn't addressed it at all.

The only thing he has actually said to me was ""I like these,"" when I was offered some new flavor of M&M's. Holiday Nut or something.

So, yeah. Got the connection back with everyone. I guess we just needed to have a really focused special breakfast. 

But, out of curiosity, has anyone had an experience like that? Where a demon becomes very spontaneously forward and affectionate?",3,1731574411.0,DemonolatryPractices,0,0.8,False

The post is deleted, so I don't know WHAT he wrote, but he got clowned bad. Appearently he invested 80% of his assets. He should be up +50% in those 2 month.

ANYWAY. Kuros just reached 1 Billion in Market Cap, I invested today (only 1.5k) and decided it's time to post about it again.

Apart from the 700% rallye it already did in 2024, lets look at the prospects:

Now that it's reached 1 Billion, institutional investors are coming in. Blackrock bought over 3% in September. Some Swiss Banks have been invested since february. They work in Spinal fusion / bone-replacement/growing (sorry english isn't my mother tongue).

ANYWAY, They got their product MagnetOS ready to roll out and patented. Appearantly it's almost double as efficient as the traditional way. Right now only 2.4% of US orthopedic surgeions are using their tecnology, so it has room to grow.

And boy did I grow. Order Numbers more than dobled from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024. Revenue went from about 12 Million in 2022, to 32 Million in 2023.

They reached 32 Million revenue in 2024 already by mid-year! So they are going to double it again in 2024 vs 2023.

Debt:

ZERO, over 10 Million in Cash.

They have FDA clearance, thats why they can aggressively expand now.

NOW, to the ones going to post the Chart. This company only exists SINCE 2016! So the chart before 2016 is from a company before 2016! They simply bought that broke/failed company to be immediately noted. Basically like a SPAC, if you want so.

Biased:  
I might be biased now that I bought, as well as because I am from Switzerland too and I trust Swiss Companies.

Am I doing something really wrong? ,"After turning 30 my friendships started... Changing? And making new friends has become so hard. 
Just before turning 30 I moved to another country for work, and all the people I met were connected to the job. And when I quit that job after 7 years of 60/70 hours week, I discovered that most of my work friends very quickly moved on and weren't that interested in hanging out with me if I wasn't working with them. 
In the meantime, over the same years some of my old best friends grew into other people and somewhere along the line decided I didn't fit into their new life that much anymore, and somehow I understand but it still feels like c**p. One of my best friends has 2 small kids and lives in Italy so of course we don't see each other often. I try to call and take on most most of the responsibility for initiating contact because I am childfree so I get that I have more headspace for this. 
Another one moved to Australia just before the pandemic, for a horrible man who treats her like dirt (like calling her with racial slurs to her face). In the beginning I was in contact with her very often because I was afraid for her. He caught on that I don't like him and slowly made it clear she was to cool our contact. She ended up marrying him despite everything and I keep checking in with her every once in a while (2/3 months) so she knows I'm still there if need be, but the friend that used to be like a sister, she's just not there anymore. 
These are some of the people who have made my life richer, but finding new people like that, it seems really hard now. 
I tried posting on expat groups, signed up for a class. I meet new people, and some are pretty nice, but usually I have to do most of the work, keep contacting to say ""let's meet for coffee"" or let's do this. I know a lot of people struggle to make new friends in this country, but I wonder have I become an uninteresting person? Is it that these days people only want superficial connections?

I was doing my daily watch browsing on my local market place (Blocket) and came across this beauty. I‚Äôm in the process of buying a new apartment but couldn‚Äôt resist the urge‚Ä¶

I got in contact with the seller who was fantastic from start to finish. We met at a coffee shop in central Stockholm to make the transaction but ended up spending about an hour talking about watches.

I‚Äôm quite unique in having such an interest in watches in my friend group, so having someone to spew my uneducated and subjective thoughts about one watch to the next was incredible and for that reason alone, I will cherish and keep this watch for many years to come.

Now on to the watch itself; this Tissot PRS516 houses the Lemania 1277 movement which was exclusively produced in 1969. The movement was also used for Omegas Moonwatch but was overhauled. The tachymetre is in good condition but the dial and the hands are in near mind condition. The case measures at 36mm but looks larger due to it being a chronograph and has a great fit on the wrist.

Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the purchase.
I hope this is a bit of eye candy for you vintage watch lovers.",4,1731573179.0,Watches,1,1.0,False

1gr0c3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityNetwork/comments/1gr0c3w/ralph_lauren_companys_mission_and_structure_essay/,Ralph Lauren Company‚Äôs Mission and Structure Essay,"## Vision and Mission Statement

As Ralph Lauren states, the mission of his company is to redefine American fashion and style, offer high-quality products to its customers, and involve individuals in the process of creation of those products. However, Ralph Lauren does not have a vision statement. The latter is critical to the company for the reason that it would provide the options for future growth (Schley and Weston 99). Moreover, the vision statement would direct the organization and help review the short-term and long-term objectives.

## Description of the Brand

The organization functions in three sections: Retail, Wholesale, and Licensing. Ralph Lauren Corporation proposes a variety of clothing goods, together with male and female collections which are retailed under numerous brand titles. Overall, Ralph Lauren Corporation trades its goods to chain stores and specialized stores. The company also provides golf apparel. Ralph Lauren Corporation also features a variety of retail stores and its e-commerce websites. The corporation also sells its wear, household, and other goods by means of licensing agreements (Lauren 15).

## Products and Services

Ralph Lauren Corporation produces its goods for both men and women, including footwear, wristwatches, belts, hats, eyewear, fine jewelry, and leather goods, including shoulder bags and luggage. There are numerous other goods produced by the Ralph Lauren Corporation which comprise bedding and bath goods, fixtures, cloth and wall covering, lights, paint, giftware, and tabletop. Moreover, it offers a series of fragrances for both men and women.

## Unique Features

One of the unique features of the Ralph Lauren company is its multi-brand approach. It provides various services to its clients and even has restaurants in several parts of the world. One may find the Polo Bar and Ralph‚Äôs Coffee in New York City. There is also a restaurant sited in Chicago and yet another restaurant located in Paris. Ralph Lauren strives to conquer the market by means of a unique amalgamation of seemingly incompatible brands.

## Current Production and Supply Chain

The key driver for Ralph Lauren‚Äôs production is its improved supply chain speed. The corporation elaborated and implemented a cross-functional teamwork approach. This move allowed Ralph Lauren Corporation to strengthen the collaboration with its contractor base in Asia. The current strategy also helped the company to minimize costs and increase the quality of its merchandise (Geczy 149). The corporation is also looking to concentrate on three of its brands ‚Äì Polo, Lauren, and Ralph Lauren. In order to match its demand and supply, the company decided to split its orders into smaller pieces in order to minimize the risk of selling out and getting behind.

## Environmental Factors

The environmental topic is one of the characteristics of the modern business world which Ralph Lauren Corporation should not ignore. Society and government have become exposed to numerous environmental dilapidations. Ralph Lauren currently implements policies aimed to minimize the negative impact on the ecology. The company also pays attention to corporate responsibility in order to contribute to the improvement of the current state of ecology (Springsteel 86). This is how the company manages to get adequate support from the public and the administration. The tactic that is currently used should also involve the implementation of a reutilize-and-recycle strategy.

## Company Structure

In 2016, the company has seen several important transformations in its organization. Ralph Lauren Corporation embraced a novel international organizational structure. These transformations capitalized on the potential of Ralph Lauren brands and produced comprehensive growth (Sheridan 33). As stated by Ralph Lauren, the new CEO‚Äôs knowledge in tactically renovating business and functioning models from local and market-focused companies to international brands allowed him to play the fundamental management role in Ralph Lauren‚Äôs administrative renovation.

## Company Performance

The new organizational structure helped the corporation increase its income level in comparison to 2015. The total income grew by 6% and stopped at the $6,860 million marks. Ralph Lauren stated that this significant growth was also a result of the new CEO‚Äôs professional approach and updated the company‚Äôs vision statement.

## Target Market

Ralph Lauren Corporation targets customers all over the world. The company‚Äôs customer profile comprises various experts, rich and prosperous people who are highly respected in the society, individuals with several houses, and equestrians, sailors, and people who practice sports such as golf. Ralph Lauren‚Äôs customers want prestige, fascination, extravagance, and honor (Williams 101). Their key values include first-class quality, uniqueness, and stylishness. The fundamental desire of Ralph Lauren‚Äôs target customers is to be appreciated, well-regarded, affluent, experienced, and classy.

## Potential Product Lines

One of the potential product lines is a clothing line for pets. This move is supported by the fact that the majority of Ralph Lauren‚Äôs clients are pet owners. The first two collections would feature clothes for cats and dogs. There should also be a collection for other animals as well. The option of personalization should also be available to the customers.

Another potential product line is the customization of the vehicle interior trim. Ralph Lauren would offer its services to the car owners that wish to personalize the look of their car. This would be an important asset for the company for the reason that Ralph Lauren‚Äôs target customers are rich and enjoy luxury. Providing them with the option of customizing their car would open a whole new array of opportunities for the corporation.

Hi everyone ,
I am someone who has suffered from severe migraines since I could remember, not  just a ‚Äútypical headache‚Äù. To the point where I‚Äôm hearing voices, I‚Äôm screaming, to the point where I‚Äôm in tears thinking why me why do I have to go through this and then days after I can‚Äôt move my head to fast  because it feels like my brain is sloshing around . I have tried every tablet/ pills, malts, oxy, migraine tablets , drinking a triple shot coffee, every strategy under the sun to try prevent the migraine from getting worse. Obviously you cannot predict when you are going to get one . But this sounds ridiculous hence why I want to share it with you all, my most recent migraine I didn‚Äôt have anything at home to take and I was too far gone at the point where I couldn‚Äôt drive to the chemist etc . I did however have left over coca*ine from the weekend and thought why not give it a try. No word of a lie within 20 minutes my vision was back to normal, I thought maybe it‚Äôs in my head etc. I still had a slight headache but it 100% stopped my migraine ! I was trying to do research to see if anyone else has done the same but couldn‚Äôt find anything . I am not promoting the use of illegal substances but I thought I might as well share with you my experience, because people that genuinely suffer from these which they knew the perfect combination to stop them from escalating.
