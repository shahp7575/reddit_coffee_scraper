1lnunpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1lnunpk/go_within_how_being_brazenly_impudent_saved_me/,"Go within. How being ""brazenly impudent"" saved me despite the circumstances.","*TLDR AT THE END BUT I SUGGEST Y'ALL READ THIS!!*

I'll share a success story that happened just three days ago and I'm still in awe. Mind you, I have known the law for almost a decade now. I'm not by any means new to this but like many of you here, I had been struggling with the law and doubted its existence. For the longest time, I was just invested in small victories such as getting a game gifted to me on Steam, getting free coffee, etc. but never the ones I truly want because such manifestations are simply the ones that ""would've happened anyway"" in my eyes, but a few days ago it was different.

My friend and I decided to go grab a bite for lunch and hang out a bit on campus. On my way to the train station, I realized I did not have my wallet in any of my pockets. That's when reality hit me like a train, I left the bag which had many of my IDs and such in it during my commute to the train station. The normal human reaction would be to panic and just give up since it was quite the lost cause. My circumstances were heavily against me. I didn't know anyone in there and most importantly, I didn't know its plate number, which can be crucial to the investigation. I called my sister and many of my friends at the time of my realization, but throwing a tantrum before the station won't help my situation. All of them were saying, ""pray and hope for the best, but I doubt anyone's a good samaritan nowadays."" Of course, I took ""some"" action in the 3D by trying to catch up to the vehicle by riding something similar and explain it to the driver to at least help me a bit. I had vague details about the vehicle, so it's extremely normal for the driver to say, ""Sorry, pal. I can't help you with this. If you had given me the plate number then we could be onto something."" 

Do you see the pattern here? It's becoming an impossibility to ever retrieve my bag. I had contacted nearby police officers at the vehicle's ""station"" (they don't have a station, it's just them parking at a nearby open area which is very common here), talked to locals, everything. All of them were saying the same thing over and over, it's like they're parroting off of each other (EIYPO yo). I didn't blame any of them since they didn't know better. But you know who did? Me. Because of the law, I know the ""first principle"" as Neville would say, which is: 

""Be still, and know that I AM God.""

What else did Neville say? Oh, here's one:

""There is no limit to the power of belief or to the possibilities of prayer, but you must be BRAZENLY IMPUDENT and not take no for an answer.""

During my second ride on the way to the final destination of the commute, I simply imagined that the bag is already with me. At first, it was receiving it and laughing it off with the drivers but when I arrived there, I was extremely disappointed that their station was simply them parked in an open area. After that disappointed me, of course I doubted the whole thing and was about to give up. I decided to stick with my affirmation and now simply imagining that I was at home, holding the fabric of my bag, touching most of the contents in there which were still intact.

""I don't care how or when this'll happen. I already have my bag and that's all that matters.""

Again, still no signs in the 3D. I persisted. I didn't do no robotic affirmations, I simply affirmed to anchor myself back in place every once in a while. Felt what I'm saying is true if I couldn't ""visualize"" at the moment since I was out and interacting with people too, but I did imagine if I had the time. After spending the day with a friend, luckily I had sold something prior to meeting up with him, I used the little money I have to go home. Again, using my imagination to anchor me back to my desired state, I simply assumed my bag's already with me. I had arrived home and the first thing I did was write an Affidavit of Loss since I was kinda prepared to get a new driver's license. Was it necessary? Nope, I had doubts like any normal being would have. 

Not even an hour after I arrived, my dad messaged the group chat asking if I had left my bag somewhere. I apologized and said yes, to which my mom agreed to drive me over to where the address is located. I talked to the lady that got a hold of my bag. She told me that to prevent others from ever stealing my bag, she grabbed it instantly and took it with her for a while. She was panicking quite a lot, so when she returned home, she was able to ask around her neighborhood to help her with my stuff. Luckily, there were kind people to take a good look at my wallet with my driver's license on it to contact an emergency person in there. Given I had money to spare, I paid off the old lady and thanked her for her troubles. I was so happy that I have my bag but at the same time, I felt more delighted helping the old lady since I did lend money to her, which she mentioned she needed a bit of money for her medicines and such. I was glad to have helped someone that day, too. 

I wasn't eager on getting it that day, but when I simply assumed the fact that I have my bag with me? It instantly conformed. Funny enough, before I left for the train station, I was listening to Neville's ""The Pearl of Great Price"" Lecture. The moment I knew I left my belongings, I doubted that man fr LMAO. On my trips to ease myself, I listened to lectures such as ""Pruning Shears of Revision"" and ""The Art of Dying"" to further enhance the little belief I have of the law that time. I simply let that undesired state of me not having my bag go, assuming that I already have it. It conformed because I wasn't forcing on no time crunches. It conformed because I believed that Imagination is your true reality. I will never doubt the law again. And also a PSA to everyone, y'all better read or listen to at least one Neville lecture PLEASE. Stick to source material (or not, it's fine) and APPLY, APPLY, APPLY!  

TLDR: I lost my bag during my commute. I simply assumed I have it by affirming and imagining every once in a while (not robotically) to eliminate the state of panic. The world was telling me no through my friends, but I was persistent and brazenly impudent that I'll get my bag back. I was still doing 3D things to ease my mind and accept the other outcome but that didn't matter at all.I got my bag thanks to an old lady who I guided all throughout my assumption unknowingly. We were both in a state of need, I paid off some of her medicine since she mentioned she needed a bit of money, I needed the bag she got during the trip.",1,1751245247.0,NevilleGoddard,0,1.0,False

Like my title states, I'm hoping to meet someone and get to know them and form an honest connection. I'm optimistic that the relationship will grow and a bright future is ahead of us!

With that, here are some details about me; I think the most important is that I am a hopeless romantic. I truly believe in love and long-lasting relationships based on love, trust and honesty. I value trust and honesty, and open communication. I believe the best foundation to any relationship is communication.

Other words people have used to describe me are loving, kind, sweet, honesty, loyal. I try to exhibit all these traits in my everyday life. I'm emotionally mature and really understand myself, I believe I live every day to better myself, and now the best way to better myself is to learn to live and grow with someone. I am confident in who I am, I am confident in what I offer, and I believe I am ready for a fully committed relationship. I want to date with intention. I am reliable and dependable; I am self-sufficient, and I have a stable career and finances for myself. I am a hard worker and I'm not afraid to say everything I have right now, I have worked to achieve. I put as much effort into my career as I do into a relationship, sometimes more effort on the latter. I believe whatever is worth it is worth the effort, time, and commitment. I would say I am also very outgoing, caring, funny, and ambitious.

I really enjoy going out, whether that's enjoying nature. Going to festivals, or events, concerts or shows. Going to movies, going out to new restaurants, new coffee shops. Anything can end up being an adventure and I love adventures! I also don't mind the quiet night at home, making dinner, enjoying a movie at home or playing board games. I am a great cook and have been cooking since I was 17. I also dabble in video games as well. I have a PS2/PS3/PS4/PS5/Switch/PC with many games, but I rarely play games these days. If you are a gamer, it would be amazing to have a player 2 with me! I also love road trips, I would love a passenger partner to go on road trips with! I love to travel, and there are so many places I would love to visit. I can't wait to find someone to share all the experiences with!

I've rambled on for quite a while, but there's so much more I can share while we take the time to get to know each other. I believe in putting in the effort, so I hope this shows I am serious and really want to find someone who I can genuinely connect with.

1lnulb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1lnulb2/am_i_crazy_tw/,Am I crazy? TW,"My older sister(24) and I(20) were talking on family vacation and she brought up our father randomly. I’ve already made it clear to her what he’s done(csa) and that I don’t want to talk about him even though she forgives him. He’s on vacation with us and I just try to avoid him. So I told her “not my dad” and left she continued and followed so I said ”I really don’t want to hear about him, im sorry” that’s when she turned and went upstairs mumbling stuff. later I sent her a message

me: i heard you say that you would “just shut up” but that’s not what i was asking. i was enjoying the conversation before that, i just said i didn’t want to hear about him

her: It’s just that you get to bring up whatever whenever and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells and not talk about so many things cause then I’m the bad guy cause I brought up something you don’t want to talk about and you get mad at me when I do when I’m just trying to talk about my day with my sister and I fully understand why you don’t want to talk about him or be around him but we’re all at the same house the rest of the week and some of my stories are going to involve him I’m trying not to bring him up but sometimes I he’s going to be in the story. It’s unfair you can bring up whatever whenever and I’m supposed to be fine with it even when I don’t want to talk about it but when I bring up a casual story that I’m the main topic and he’s part of one side It’s like I’ve suddenly become just as bad as him. I hate what he did I will never forgive him for that but I don’t have a lot of people in my life and he helps me whenever I need it and with everything in my life I need that help and I need the good memories cause we’ve had so many bad ones I can’t just keep thinking about the bad ones or I’m never going get of this stupid depression. I’ve been working like all month and I just want a drama and stress free vacation

me: i just want to set a boundary now, and i don’t want to talk about him myself either, and i don’t want to hear about him if you’re specifically talking to me. i promise i wasnt mad when i said “ur dad” and then “i don’t want to hear about him” when you continued, but i was mad when you walked away mumbling. it hurt so much to see you talking with him specifically right after it, too. i get it, he’s your dad and im not asking for you to stop spending time with him. i can completely relate with not wanting to think about the bad things, that’s all im trying to do on this vacation with the man who raised and sexually assaulted me. never once have i believed you’re as bad as him or intended to make you feel that way. if you want to talk in person another time, we can, or we can move on

me: also, i really do appreciate the coffee. thank you

her:When I went out there it was just mom and I think one other person out there he came out like 10 min later. I understand you don’t want to talk to or about him but you can’t get mad at me for talking to him I will do my best not to talk about him to you but I’m not going to actively avoid him. Idk how I’m supposed to navigate this whole situation cause you’re my sister and ofc I don’t want to seem like I don’t give a shit about what happened to you cause I do but like you said that is my dad and I can’t just ignore that yanno? And I know he did fuck shit he put his hands around the throat and choked me but he’s made so much progress in being a better person since the fire especially I’ve talked to him about a lot of stuff that went down and I know nothing he says or does will ever change what happened but I think at some point you should talk to him about it all and I can be there if you want but he genuinely doesn’t understand why you don’t talk to him and ik you don’t give a fuck about his feelings and rightfully so but you know it’s VERY rare when dad shows actual emotions but everytime we talk about you not coming around there’s a lot there mainly confusion and sadness and I think y’all could figure out a way to make you comfortable being around like him agreeing to keep distance and stuff yanno? I’m not trying to talk you into doing anything you don’t want to do I just really miss our family and it breaks my heart constantly thinking about the fact we may never be the same again and I hate it so much and idk what to do

me:i miss how it used to be too and i hate that it will never be the same too i miss having my dad too but a dad would never put his on me the way he did. i would love to have a relationship with him some day but it’s not my job to tell a grown man that touching his 13 year old child’s vagina is wrong. he knows what he did and i know that cus right after he bought me everything i asked for just to keep me quiet. you said that we could figure out a way to be comfortable around him, and as of yet this is it. if everyone gets to ignore/not be around aunt lisa for simply being annoying then i will proceed ignoring him/his existence. i’m not mad about you hanging out with him it just hurt. i don’t want you to stop hanging out with him i never asked that

her:I haven’t read your last message yet but he is taking the  pontoon out me mom and (roommate) are swimming if you y’all wanna join

i went out and swam with her after that, but we never talked about it. For the rest of vacation, either. She also didn’t bring him up once after that unless there were other people around. It’s been 4 days now.

She’s had the time to make a Facebook post about having a long emotional conversation with her roommate about an album, though.

I think she really needs therapy?   


TLDR: my older sister has BPD, and I don’t know how to go about this situation. She always downplays me and plays the victim. When I first told her what happened with our dad, she did that mumbling under her breath thing and ignored me. There was never a falter in her relationship with our father when I told her what happened to me (csa) in fact it’s strengthened since I’ve started avoiding him. I’ve been extremely low contact for the past year with him. She doesn’t take me seriously but I do want to have a relationship with her despite what she’s also done to me growing up (cocsa)

My mother (53) and I (25, F) have had an interesting relationship to say the least. For most of my teenage years, I was her impromptu therapist, listening and giving advice I didn't know a damn thing about. My childhood wasn't much better, probably because I hardly saw her. 

My mother is the type of person where she knows her life is absolute dogshit, but refuses to realize she put herself there. She's rude to everyone, she doesn't share anything, she thinks she's the smartest person in the room, and if you try and stick up for yourself, she just gets louder until you shut up. That's how it is and how it's always been, but lately... she's gotten bolder. 

She's been talking to me more lately about how she's sad she'll never be a homeowner, hinting at the fact that I have two homes. For clarification, I'm renting a 3 bedroom home with my husband (23) and my grandmother left me her home in her will. Her and my mom never got along so I'm not too surprised and she shouldn't be either. Anyways, I'm currently renovating my grandmother's house, new everything, adding a basement, second story, the works. And that takes time, and money. Money isn't an issue with myself or my husband, he's a respected nurse and I'm a phlebotomist, working in the same hospital and everything. But it was left to me, and I do plan on moving in once it's renovated. 

Earlier this week, my mom came over to our home. She was looking around a lot, turning on lights, seeing how fast the water heated up, the whole nine yards. When I asked her what she was doing, she handed me a folder an inch thick with documents. I looked inside while she wandered off to the fireplace and nearly choked on my coffee. It was all my medical bills, doctors appointments, clothing receipts, food receipts, and basically every penny she's ever spent on me since I was born. I asked her why she'd give me this and she said ""because I knew you'd want to leave me eventually, and now you can't"" then she whipped put her phone, recording and posting photos to Facebook of our home, saying what she was going to change. Once again I asked her what she meant, and she said because she sacrificed all that, we should give her our house. I laughed, loud and ugly. My husband looked between her red face and my tears, confused as hell. I told her no, and said it was time for her to leave. She said she'd sue for emotional damage and she'd never talk to us again. I said fine, opening the door for her and pushing her through. Before I closed the door, I handed her an ultrasound photo. ""Twins."" I said, holding my barely showing stomach. ""Post about that."" I slammed the door, changing the wifi password before she could actually post anything. 


She bombarded me with messages and calls, banging on my door. I didn't say anything, just let my two, very large, very pissed off Rottweilers bark twice and scare her off. You could hear her muttering and screeching from inside the house. 

It's been two years since that day. My mother still hasn't let up about it, wailing and crying. I don't care anymore. I'm here, in my grandmother's home, sitting by her wood burning fireplace, watching my husband play with our son and daughter on the plush family room rug, the dogs licking their faces and our old grumpy cats purring in my lap, and I know I've won.

It was hot today, not blisteringly so but certainly up there. I enjoyed my time out there, though I was a little more tired that usual. The fire alarm went off early this morning - no fire, just a low battery - so I have been a little sleepy-eyed. I still had it in me to write though, both today and last night. I have finished the second to last scene of I'm Still Sisyphus' last chapter and I have started the last. I wrote around 550 words as well as around 200 words of extra plot-guidance that I'll use to hopefully finish the chapter tomorrow. I make no promises, though.

Darling called. They invited me to go to the local museum of our town this Friday. I can't say whether I've been or not; I'm leaning towards 'no' or at least not since I was a wee one. I certainly don't remember doing so. I'll probably dread going out on the day of but when I'm actually out I'm sure I'll have a fine time. I'm quite a bit like a toddler or a cat in that way.

Anyway, I took a break in the middle of my writing to do some gardening. I'm officially use the last of that giant bag of dirt I bought a few months ago plus most of the compost. I don't think the bins been that low since we first installed it. I planted some of the ornamental plants and flowers that mother bought plus two Zucchini plants she got on sail. We weren't planning on doing Zucchini this year but you can't beat a good sail.

God, my eyes are heavy. Mother made chilli for dinner so I'm sure such a nice heavy dinner is also dragging my brain down a little bit. I'd better go prepare my evening coffee.

It seems like a lot of the community is older (which I totally respect), but I’m in my 20s and would love to find out if there are any hidden spots, events, or hangouts where younger people connect, locals or seasonal visitors.

Are there any fitness studios, coffee shops, beach spots, or community events that tend to attract a younger vibe? Or should I be heading off-island to find that?

We enjoy it a lot but we're not ""a Disney family"" if that makes sense. Finishing out first DCL cruise tomorrow and it's been an absolute blast. Will be back for sure.

Room:
- didn't want a balcony, my kids are climbers. Heard on here the balcony doors are secure but I just wouldn't be able to relax knowing the resourcefulness of my little monkeys.
- we booked an 8B deluxe family oceanview and it was perfect for us. We didn't spend a ton of time in the room but we never really felt cramped. Only thing I'd do differently would be to make sure we had everything we need for the evening and next morning out of the drawers that are blocked by the porthole bed before we leave for dinner.

Food:
- 8/10 overall. Breakfast and lunch buffets were pretty crowded but not overwhelming. Quality, depending on what we chose, was decent to very good. Evening meals were excellent. Kid 1 recently discovered the joys of steak and she was pumped to see it on the kid's menu. 
- didn't try Palo or anything in that class but the coffee shop was a nice treat each morning. I normally don't get excited about coffee but the designs on top of our lattes were nice little touches 

Service:
- fantastic across the board. Room attendant was too kind and kept our room spotless.
- our servers were the best. Mrs ordered the samosa appetizer on pirate's night and they asked if we liked Indian food; we said yes and every night afterwards they'd bring an Indian dish with our entrees. The lamb vindaloo was the best dish of our trip.

Excursions:
- Blue Lagoon: getting off the boat and onto the ferry to the island wasn't great. Didn't get there until 2+ hrs after our check-in time. Otherwise it was fine. We knew that we weren't doing a premium experience and it met our expectations.
- Lookout Cay: we enjoyed it but nothing to write home about. The water was beautiful. Food was underwhelming but fine 

Kids clubs:
- nursery seemed totally adequate. Hard to judge since our toddler is kind of clingy but the staff was really nice.
- our older two loved their club. They'd ask to go even when we had other plans.

We enjoyed it quite a bit even though the fireworks show didn't happen on pirate's night due to technical difficulties. Already reserved our placeholder for the next one.",17,1751244461.0,dcl,4,1.0,False

For the first time in a long time, the stars are aligning and I get to spend the entire day with her! So I want to find something really fun that she'll enjoy. She never does anything just for herself/just for fun so I'd like to give her a great time.

She's a bit of a homebody and my brain is stuck trying to figure out stuff to do with her. Here's a list of stuff she likes and dislikes - any ideas on places I can take her would be very welcome.

Dislikes:

- She dislikes eating out and has a small appetite. I was thinking of making a little home-cooked picnic to eat on the go.

- She dislikes sun exposure. Nature trails or botanical gardens in the middle of the day without shade are a no-go, but dusk would be OK.

- She's down-to-earth and dislikes really upscale/fancy stuff.

- She doesn't like sports, shopping for clothes, or spas/massages.

- She doesn't like loud music (like concerts) or really heavy crowds.

Likes:

- She loves rare flowers.

- She likes going for long walks either early in the day or at dusk.

- Thai, Chinese-American, and Korean food (she is vegetarian).

- She likes places where she can walk around and look at lots of different and unique things, like really good farmer's markets or swap meets.

Things I considered:

- Orange Circle - she's been there many times before and I think she'd get bored pretty quickly.

- Fashion Island - A decent place to walk around, with a mix of indoor & outdoor depending on her preference, but she's already been many times I think she'd get bored here, too. Last time we went, she didn't seem to enjoy it.

- Sherman Library and/or Roger's Gardens - She's often expressed that she's not impressed with their collections.

Ideas I have so far (for a Saturday or Sunday):

- Take the train to Little Tokyo and walk around and check out the little shops. Get some coffee and share a pastry at a nice bakery. Find a nice vegetarian place or bring a packed lunch. This would be a new experience for her. She loves NASA and space-related things and might like the Astronaut Onizuka statue. (We've already been to Space Shuttle Endeavor and she loved it.) I also think she'd find Arthur Nakane absolutely delightful if he happens to be playing that day.

- Visit the Exposition Park Rose Garden, since she loves roses.

- Visit Huntington Library, Descanso, and/or Arlington Gardens in Pasadena/etc. Problem: sunlight hours.

- Visit the Santa Fe Springs swap meet. (We used to go when I was a kid and it might bring back fun memories.)

- Visit the Spring Tea Room in Fullerton for high tea. She *might* enjoy this, I'm not sure.

- Walk a nice shaded trail at dusk (like the Juanita Cooke Trail in Fullerton, or the Jeffrey Open Space Trail).

- Visit the Fullerton Arboretum (problem: it closes early, before dusk, so she might not be OK with the sun).

Are there any other fun places to walk around, mostly shaded, for someone who doesn't like crowds, direct sunlight, or anything too fancy, but who loves flowers and more quiet activities?

Thank you so much everyone for helping me give my mom a really memorable and relaxing birthday!",1,1751244445.0,orangecounty,2,1.0,False

Pollux can pound sand! I can't wait for Ring to tear him apart!

I feel for Bryce as all of the Danika stories is revealed. She thought she knew everything about her. I can see why Danika did it though. Just like Bryce kept things from her parents to protect them, Danika wanted to protect Bryce.

And the Asteri are the Daglans! And it is confirmed that Ruhn's a daemati. And that what Cormac was doing was winnowing. 

Speaking of Cormac, I understand why Bryce did not fully trust him, but to keep him from the plan to safeguard Emile made me sad. He felt like he failed to protect Sofie, then did not get a chance to make it right by keeping his promise to keep Emile safe. At least he was able to go out on his own terms though.

I hope that SJM doesn't pull a (spoiler for Hunger Games here) >!Peeta turning on Katniss!< and make Hunt fight Bryce. I don't know if my heart can take it. I love them as a couple. They balance each other out and bring out the best in each other.

So, I got my new Airpods Max and Airpods Pro 2 yesterday, so all of this morning I spent my time comparing both of them to my QuietComfort Ultra and WH-1000XM5 (I dont have XM6 yet) in numerous different situations when I put every part of the ANC to testing and how well each headphone cancells each noise on each simulation comparing to the others. Here you go...!

Test 1 (Coffee Shop / Video used )

4.-Airpods Max

The Airpods Max manage to cancell amazingly well all of the noises, considering they are a 5 y/o headphone comparing to the more recently 2 y/o QuietComfort Ultra for example. There is a ""rumble"" like sound which the Max cancell completely, unlike the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra which let that in a little bit, while they also manage to cancell the background voices and sudden voices very well too, tho slightly worse than the rest. And the background coffe shop noises like plates, forks and other high frecuency sounds may be cancelled a little worst than the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, tho better than the Pro 2.

3.-XM5

The XM5 ANC is also very great, the rumble is almost completely gone, but not 100% like the Max, . The XM5 manage to cancell those voices almost on par with the QuietComfort Ultra, maybe a tad less, but a little better than the Max.

2.-Airpods Pro 2

Surprisingly, I found that the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the most amount of the voices, just a tad better than the QuietComfort Ultra. The ""rumble"" type of noise is gone completely like the Max. But where they seem to be slightly worst is when cancelling high frecuency sounds like the plates and forks noises on the coffee shop. All of the 3 over the ear headphones manage them equally well, but the Pro 2 seems to struggle a bit more.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

They manage to cancell those background and sudden voices slightly better than the Airpods Max and XM5, but slightly worst than the Airpods Pro 2. But they let in a little of that ""rumble"" type of noise, which the Max and Pro 2 cancell completely. I would say its a tie between the QuietComfort Ultra and Pro 2, I prefer more the ANC type of the Bose since those high frecuency noises are cancelled better, while the voices and rumble is just a tad worse.

Note : Even comparing the last place, which is the Airpods Max, which also cancells more rumble noise than all of the rest, against the QuietComfort Ultra which is the first place, the difference is very small, its just small details and some slight advantages that makes the difference between the 4th place and 1st place, but they all have their downsides and advantages.

Test 2 (Plane Noise / Video used )

4.-XM5

The XM5 manage to cancell 100% of the engine noise, which as I said, is a ""wind"" type of noise, but let in more of that engine rumble noise. So, they cancell more engine noise than the Max, but they cancell less of that engine rumble comparing to the Max.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 cancell 100% of the engine ""wind"" type of noise, just like the XM5 and more than the Max. And they also cancell that engine rumble more than the XM5 and the Bose, but not as good as the Airpods Max.

2.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to cancell the rumble of the engine completely, the engine noise, which is a ""wind"" type of noise, is cancelled considerably well, but probably the worst cancelling that ""wind"" noise in comparison to the other 3.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose manage to cancell almost all of the ""wind"" noise, but not 100%. And they cancell also almost all of that rumble engine noise, which would be more than the Pro 2 and XM5, but not as good as the Max. IMO I prefer to cancell almost all of both noises, instead of cancelling completely the rumble but cancelling worst of the ""wind"" noise like the Max.

Test 3 (Office / Video used )

4.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 dont perform as good as the rest here, like I mentioned on the first test, they struggle with high frecuency noises, and on a busy Office is full of those noises. The Pro 2 seems to block noticeable less than the Max and XM5 here, specially if you focus on the keyboard noises, it will be more noticeable on the Pro 2 than on the rest. There is a slight low frecuency background noise that is noticeable on both the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, here on the Max is cancelled 100%.

3.-Airpods Max

The Max seems to struggle a little bit more with those high frecuency noises, like keyboards. comparing them to the XM5, they seem to be inferior on an Office ambience. There is a slight low frecuency background noise that is noticeable on both the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, here on the Max is cancelled 100%.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose are able to cancell very well the high frecuency noises, definetely better than the Pro 2, slightly better than the Max, and slightly inferior than the XM5. While they have this very slight low frecuency sound on the background, they are still superior on cancelling the more noticeable noises like the keyboards in comparison to both the Apple headphones.

🏆1.-XM5

The Sony manages to cancell amazingly well those high frecuency noises like keyboards very well, in many cases they are cancelled 100%, while in both of the Apple headphones are mostly always noticeable. While they have this very slight low frecuency sound on the background, like the Bose, hey are still superior on cancelling the more noticeable noises like the keyboards in comparison to both the Apple headphones and the Bose.

Test 4 (Library / Video used )

4.-XM5

The XM5 cancell the less amount of background chatter of the bunch, while they do cancell very well those high frecuencies, maybe on par if not slightly better than the Bose, they not as good as the rest when it comes to cancelling that background chatter.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2, just like the Max, are able to cancell 100% of the background chatter noise on the library, but again, they fell short when cancelling those high frecuency noises like keyboards and typing.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose manage to cancell almost all of the background chatter most of the time, and in some moments they actually cancell it 100%, but not always, like the Max does. Though they do cancell almost all of the high frecuency noises like the keyboards or typing, on par with the XM5, slightly more than the Max and noticeable more than the Pro 2.

🏆1.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to block 100% of the background chatter and they only let in some of the high frecuency noises like keyboards, though very muffled down. I overall prefer cancelling always 100% of the background chatter and cancell slightly less high frecuency noises comparing them to the QuietComfort Ultra, over cancelling slightly less background chatter and slightly more high frecuency noises.

Test 5 (Garden / Video used )

4.-Airpods Pro 2

The fountain noise is reduced very well, but slightly less than both the QuietComfort Ultra and Airpods Max. The bird noises are more noticeable on the Pro 2 than with the rest of the bunch, not massively, but considerably.

3.-Airpods Max

They cancell most of the fountain noise, but not all of it. And reduce the birds noises very well.

2.-XM5

The fountain noise is reduced less than both the Bose and Airpods Max, and more or less on par with the Pro 2. But the bird noises is the most reduced on the bunch, considerably more reduced than the Pro 2. And slightly more reduced than the Bose and Max.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The fountain noise is cancelled slightly better than the Airpods Max, on some moments I would say they cancell it almost completely or completely. The birds noises are reduced very well too, slightly more than the Airpods Max but slightly less than the XM5.

Test 6 (Rain / Video used )

4.-Airpods Max

The rain noise itself is cancelled very well on the Max. And the water drops touching the floor are nicely muffled too.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The rain noise is cancelled even more than the Max, and at times it seems to be completely erased. Though the water drops touching the ground seems to be cancelled worse than the Max, not a big difference but noticeable.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose cancells more or less the same amount of the rain noise comparing them to the Airpods Max or XM5. And the water drops touching the ground is cancelled slightly better than the Max but slightly worse than the XM5.

🏆1.-XM5

The rain noise is cancelled just as good as on the Max, but not as good as the Pro 2. Though the water drops falling on the ground is cancelled amazingly well, more than both the Apple headphones.

Test 7 (City / Video used )

4.-XM5

The Sony manages to cancell the people voices pretty well, and it manages to cancell quite nicely the low frecuency background sound caused by the cars and the sounds on the city,, maybe just slightly inferior than the Bose QuietComfort Ultra.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2, manages to cancell the background low frecuency noise very well, though slightly not as good as the Bose or Max, but slightly superior than the XM5. The Pro 2 are able to cancell very slightly more the people voices comparing to the Max, I really mean the very slightly part, if the APM is a 4/5 the Pro 2 is a 4.2/5. They are also very slightly better than the XM5 and Bose when it comes to cancelling the people voices.

2.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to cancell the low frecuency sound of the city almost completely at every moment. They also manage to cancell the people chatter and voices very well too, more or less at the same level comparing them to the XM5.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The QuietComfort Ultra are able to cancell almost the same amount of people voices if not the same amount comparing them to the XM5 and Max, and slightly inferior comparing them to the Pro 2. They aslo manage to cancell very well the low freceuncy road sound, they cancell slightly more than the XM5 and Pro 2, and more or less the same than the Max.

Test 8 (Mall / Video used )

4.-QuietComfort Ultra

The QuietComfort Ultra, like the rest of over the ear headphones on the comparison, did a similar job overall, they get the last place but with a very minimal difference to the 3rd and 2nd place, I honestly found all of the over the ears almost identical on this test.

3.-Airpods Max

The Max manages to muffle the people chatter very well, comparing them to the XM5 they do a similar job overall, they are just half of a tad more superior than the Bose here.

2.-XM5

The XM5 are able to cancell more or less the same amount of the people chatter comparing them to the Max. Maybe just half of a tad more than the Max.

🏆1.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 did an amazing job here, they were able to cancell slightly more than both of the XM5 and Airpods Max. They also cancelled slightly more than the Bose. Though some of unnoticeable high frecuency noises on the Max and XM5 are slightly noticeable here.

Podium🏆

1.-QuietComfort Ultra : 1ST (🏆4) / 2ND (🏆3) / 3RD(🏆0) / 4TH (🏆1)

2.-WH-1000XM5 : 1ST (🏆2) / 2ND (🏆2) / 3RD (🏆1) / 4TH (🏆3)

3.-Airpods Max : 1ST (🏆1) / 2ND (🏆2) / 3RD (🏆3) / 4TH (🏆2)

4.-Airpods Pro 2 : 1ST (🏆1) / 2ND (🏆1) / 3RD (🏆4) / 4TH (🏆2)

Conclusion

As you can see, the QuietComfort Ultra were the overall dominant headphone, at least for ANC capabilities, which is also the newer headphone of the bunch. Then the XM5, Airpods Max and Pro 2 performed very closely, each with their own advantages over the other two.

Please take in mind that on many tests and simulations the differences are VERY subtle and small, in some tests the last place is more close than you could imagine to the 1st place.

The rain noise itself is cancelled very well on the Max. And the water drops touching the floor are nicely muffled too.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The rain noise is cancelled even more than the Max, and at times it seems to be completely erased. Though the water drops touching the ground seems to be cancelled worse than the Max, not a big difference but noticeable.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose cancells more or less the same amount of the rain noise comparing them to the Airpods Max or XM5. And the water drops touching the ground is cancelled slightly better than the Max but slightly worse than the XM5.

🏆1.-XM5

The rain noise is cancelled just as good as on the Max, but not as good as the Pro 2. Though the water drops falling on the ground is cancelled amazingly well, more than both the Apple headphones.

Test 7 (City / Video used )

4.-XM5

The Sony manages to cancell the people voices pretty well, and it manages to cancell quite nicely the low frecuency background sound caused by the cars and the sounds on the city,, maybe just slightly inferior than the Bose QuietComfort Ultra.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2, manages to cancell the background low frecuency noise very well, though slightly not as good as the Bose or Max, but slightly superior than the XM5. The Pro 2 are able to cancell very slightly more the people voices comparing to the Max, I really mean the very slightly part, if the APM is a 4/5 the Pro 2 is a 4.2/5. They are also very slightly better than the XM5 and Bose when it comes to cancelling the people voices.

2.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to cancell the low frecuency sound of the city almost completely at every moment. They also manage to cancell the people chatter and voices very well too, more or less at the same level comparing them to the XM5.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The QuietComfort Ultra are able to cancell almost the same amount of people voices if not the same amount comparing them to the XM5 and Max, and slightly inferior comparing them to the Pro 2. They aslo manage to cancell very well the low freceuncy road sound, they cancell slightly more than the XM5 and Pro 2, and more or less the same than the Max.

Test 8 (Mall / Video used )

4.-QuietComfort Ultra

The QuietComfort Ultra, like the rest of over the ear headphones on the comparison, did a similar job overall, they get the last place but with a very minimal difference to the 3rd and 2nd place, I honestly found all of the over the ears almost identical on this test.

3.-Airpods Max

The Max manages to muffle the people chatter very well, comparing them to the XM5 they do a similar job overall, they are just half of a tad more superior than the Bose here.

2.-XM5

The XM5 are able to cancell more or less the same amount of the people chatter comparing them to the Max. Maybe just half of a tad more than the Max.

🏆1.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 did an amazing job here, they were able to cancell slightly more than both of the XM5 and Airpods Max. They also cancelled slightly more than the Bose. Though some of unnoticeable high frecuency noises on the Max and XM5 are slightly noticeable here.

Podium🏆

1.-QuietComfort Ultra : 1ST (🏆4) / 2ND (🏆3) / 3RD(🏆0) / 4TH (🏆1)

2.-WH-1000XM5 : 1ST (🏆2) / 2ND (🏆2) / 3RD (🏆1) / 4TH (🏆3)

3.-Airpods Max : 1ST (🏆1) / 2ND (🏆2) / 3RD (🏆3) / 4TH (🏆2)

4.-Airpods Pro 2 : 1ST (🏆1) / 2ND (🏆1) / 3RD (🏆4) / 4TH (🏆2)

Conclusion

As you can see, the QuietComfort Ultra were the overall dominant headphone, at least for ANC capabilities, which is also the newer headphone of the bunch. Then the XM5, Airpods Max and Pro 2 performed very closely, each with their own advantages over the other two.

Please take in mind that on many tests and simulations the differences are VERY subtle and small, in some tests the last place is more close than you could imagine to the 1st place.

So, I got my new Airpods Max and Airpods Pro 2 yesterday, so all of this morning I spent my time comparing both of them to my QuietComfort Ultra and WH-1000XM5 (I dont have XM6 yet) in numerous different situations when I put every part of the ANC to testing and how well each headphone cancells each noise on each simulation comparing to the others. Here you go...!

Test 1 (Coffee Shop / Video used )

4.-Airpods Max

The Airpods Max manage to cancell amazingly well all of the noises, considering they are a 5 y/o headphone comparing to the more recently 2 y/o QuietComfort Ultra for example. There is a ""rumble"" like sound which the Max cancell completely, unlike the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra which let that in a little bit, while they also manage to cancell the background voices and sudden voices very well too, tho slightly worse than the rest. And the background coffe shop noises like plates, forks and other high frecuency sounds may be cancelled a little worst than the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, tho better than the Pro 2.

3.-XM5

The XM5 ANC is also very great, the rumble is almost completely gone, but not 100% like the Max, . The XM5 manage to cancell those voices almost on par with the QuietComfort Ultra, maybe a tad less, but a little better than the Max.

2.-Airpods Pro 2

Surprisingly, I found that the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the most amount of the voices, just a tad better than the QuietComfort Ultra. The ""rumble"" type of noise is gone completely like the Max. But where they seem to be slightly worst is when cancelling high frecuency sounds like the plates and forks noises on the coffee shop. All of the 3 over the ear headphones manage them equally well, but the Pro 2 seems to struggle a bit more.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

They manage to cancell those background and sudden voices slightly better than the Airpods Max and XM5, but slightly worst than the Airpods Pro 2. But they let in a little of that ""rumble"" type of noise, which the Max and Pro 2 cancell completely. I would say its a tie between the QuietComfort Ultra and Pro 2, I prefer more the ANC type of the Bose since those high frecuency noises are cancelled better, while the voices and rumble is just a tad worse.

Note : Even comparing the last place, which is the Airpods Max, which also cancells more rumble noise than all of the rest, against the QuietComfort Ultra which is the first place, the difference is very small, its just small details and some slight advantages that makes the difference between the 4th place and 1st place, but they all have their downsides and advantages.

Test 2 (Plane Noise / Video used )

4.-XM5

The XM5 manage to cancell 100% of the engine noise, which as I said, is a ""wind"" type of noise, but let in more of that engine rumble noise. So, they cancell more engine noise than the Max, but they cancell less of that engine rumble comparing to the Max.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 cancell 100% of the engine ""wind"" type of noise, just like the XM5 and more than the Max. And they also cancell that engine rumble more than the XM5 and the Bose, but not as good as the Airpods Max.

2.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to cancell the rumble of the engine completely, the engine noise, which is a ""wind"" type of noise, is cancelled considerably well, but probably the worst cancelling that ""wind"" noise in comparison to the other 3.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose manage to cancell almost all of the ""wind"" noise, but not 100%. And they cancell also almost all of that rumble engine noise, which would be more than the Pro 2 and XM5, but not as good as the Max. IMO I prefer to cancell almost all of both noises, instead of cancelling completely the rumble but cancelling worst of the ""wind"" noise like the Max.

Test 3 (Office / Video used )

4.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 dont perform as good as the rest here, like I mentioned on the first test, they struggle with high frecuency noises, and on a busy Office is full of those noises. The Pro 2 seems to block noticeable less than the Max and XM5 here, specially if you focus on the keyboard noises, it will be more noticeable on the Pro 2 than on the rest. There is a slight low frecuency background noise that is noticeable on both the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, here on the Max is cancelled 100%.

3.-Airpods Max

The Max seems to struggle a little bit more with those high frecuency noises, like keyboards. comparing them to the XM5, they seem to be inferior on an Office ambience. There is a slight low frecuency background noise that is noticeable on both the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, here on the Max is cancelled 100%.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose are able to cancell very well the high frecuency noises, definetely better than the Pro 2, slightly better than the Max, and slightly inferior than the XM5. While they have this very slight low frecuency sound on the background, they are still superior on cancelling the more noticeable noises like the keyboards in comparison to both the Apple headphones.

🏆1.-XM5

The Sony manages to cancell amazingly well those high frecuency noises like keyboards very well, in many cases they are cancelled 100%, while in both of the Apple headphones are mostly always noticeable. While they have this very slight low frecuency sound on the background, like the Bose, hey are still superior on cancelling the more noticeable noises like the keyboards in comparison to both the Apple headphones and the Bose.

Test 4 (Library / Video used )

4.-XM5

The XM5 cancell the less amount of background chatter of the bunch, while they do cancell very well those high frecuencies, maybe on par if not slightly better than the Bose, they not as good as the rest when it comes to cancelling that background chatter.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2, just like the Max, are able to cancell 100% of the background chatter noise on the library, but again, they fell short when cancelling those high frecuency noises like keyboards and typing.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose manage to cancell almost all of the background chatter most of the time, and in some moments they actually cancell it 100%, but not always, like the Max does. Though they do cancell almost all of the high frecuency noises like the keyboards or typing, on par with the XM5, slightly more than the Max and noticeable more than the Pro 2.

🏆1.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to block 100% of the background chatter and they only let in some of the high frecuency noises like keyboards, though very muffled down. I overall prefer cancelling always 100% of the background chatter and cancell slightly less high frecuency noises comparing them to the QuietComfort Ultra, over cancelling slightly less background chatter and slightly more high frecuency noises.

Test 5 (Garden / Video used )

4.-Airpods Pro 2

The fountain noise is reduced very well, but slightly less than both the QuietComfort Ultra and Airpods Max. The bird noises are more noticeable on the Pro 2 than with the rest of the bunch, not massively, but considerably.

3.-Airpods Max

They cancell most of the fountain noise, but not all of it. And reduce the birds noises very well.

2.-XM5

The fountain noise is reduced less than both the Bose and Airpods Max, and more or less on par with the Pro 2. But the bird noises is the most reduced on the bunch, considerably more reduced than the Pro 2. And slightly more reduced than the Bose and Max.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The fountain noise is cancelled slightly better than the Airpods Max, on some moments I would say they cancell it almost completely or completely. The birds noises are reduced very well too, slightly more than the Airpods Max but slightly less than the XM5.

Test 6 (Rain / Video used )

4.-Airpods Max

The rain noise itself is cancelled very well on the Max. And the water drops touching the floor are nicely muffled too.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The rain noise is cancelled even more than the Max, and at times it seems to be completely erased. Though the water drops touching the ground seems to be cancelled worse than the Max, not a big difference but noticeable.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

1lnuc4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lnuc4u/spleenless/,Spleenless,"Hello, I’m 35 years old and have been living without a spleen since 2013. A couple of years ago, I had a very bad stomach illness, and ever since, I’ve noticed that my stomach often becomes bloated, and I tend to experience diarrhoea every month or two.

I eat well, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and I’m extremely careful with food hygiene. I rarely catch colds or the flu, but these recurring stomach issues have become quite frequent recently.

I do drink quite a bit of coffee, though it’s not particularly strong. I’m wondering whether this could be related to the absence of my spleen. I remember my doctor once said that I might be more prone to infections, which didn’t seem to be the case for years—but now I’m starting to notice a pattern.

Could this be connected to the long-term effects of living without a spleen? Are there any tests, habits, or dietary changes you would recommend?

Thank you very much in advance.",1,1751244263.0,AskDocs,1,0.99,False

She told me to keep what I like and sell it later, and sell the rest now to re-invest. Well, I was looking through the cards and found a few keepers... a LBJ rookie, a Tom brady patch, a Wayne Gretzky auto, etc. Well, I found a 1969 topps Louis Alcindor Rookie #25, but a kid scratched out the name on the backside and wrote ""KAJ"". I figured, that almost completely devalued the card, so I put it in my sell pile. I remember that fateful day when I sold it: a gloomy sunday at San Clemente's Cars and Coffee car show. I had my cards baking on the hood of my dad's 1969 mustang like a pure dumbass outlaw, and a guy showed interest in the Alcindor RC. Well, I was aking $10(Still fucking stupid, IK), but the guy says, there's writing on the back, it's not worth that much. So I take his offer: $3. One night, I'm lying in bed, doing the usual ""questioning my life choices at 3am"" thing, when I remember this moment. I immediately spring out of bed and grab my phone. I am now hating myself and that Jackass who scammed me.

So, I got my new Airpods Max and Airpods Pro 2 yesterday, so all of this morning I spent my time comparing both of them to my QuietComfort Ultra and WH-1000XM5 (I dont have XM6 yet) in numerous different situations when I put every part of the ANC to testing and how well each headphone cancells each noise on each simulation comparing to the others. Here you go...!

Test 1 (Coffee Shop / Video used )

4.-Airpods Max

The Airpods Max manage to cancell amazingly well all of the noises, considering they are a 5 y/o headphone comparing to the more recently 2 y/o QuietComfort Ultra for example. There is a ""rumble"" like sound which the Max cancell completely, unlike the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra which let that in a little bit, while they also manage to cancell the background voices and sudden voices very well too, tho slightly worse than the rest. And the background coffe shop noises like plates, forks and other high frecuency sounds may be cancelled a little worst than the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, tho better than the Pro 2.

3.-XM5

The XM5 ANC is also very great, the rumble is almost completely gone, but not 100% like the Max, . The XM5 manage to cancell those voices almost on par with the QuietComfort Ultra, maybe a tad less, but a little better than the Max.

2.-Airpods Pro 2

Surprisingly, I found that the Airpods Pro 2 cancelled the most amount of the voices, just a tad better than the QuietComfort Ultra. The ""rumble"" type of noise is gone completely like the Max. But where they seem to be slightly worst is when cancelling high frecuency sounds like the plates and forks noises on the coffee shop. All of the 3 over the ear headphones manage them equally well, but the Pro 2 seems to struggle a bit more.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

They manage to cancell those background and sudden voices slightly better than the Airpods Max and XM5, but slightly worst than the Airpods Pro 2. But they let in a little of that ""rumble"" type of noise, which the Max and Pro 2 cancell completely. I would say its a tie between the QuietComfort Ultra and Pro 2, I prefer more the ANC type of the Bose since those high frecuency noises are cancelled better, while the voices and rumble is just a tad worse.

Note : Even comparing the last place, which is the Airpods Max, which also cancells more rumble noise than all of the rest, against the QuietComfort Ultra which is the first place, the difference is very small, its just small details and some slight advantages that makes the difference between the 4th place and 1st place, but they all have their downsides and advantages.

Test 2 (Plane Noise / Video used )

4.-XM5

The XM5 manage to cancell 100% of the engine noise, which as I said, is a ""wind"" type of noise, but let in more of that engine rumble noise. So, they cancell more engine noise than the Max, but they cancell less of that engine rumble comparing to the Max.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 cancell 100% of the engine ""wind"" type of noise, just like the XM5 and more than the Max. And they also cancell that engine rumble more than the XM5 and the Bose, but not as good as the Airpods Max.

2.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to cancell the rumble of the engine completely, the engine noise, which is a ""wind"" type of noise, is cancelled considerably well, but probably the worst cancelling that ""wind"" noise in comparison to the other 3.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose manage to cancell almost all of the ""wind"" noise, but not 100%. And they cancell also almost all of that rumble engine noise, which would be more than the Pro 2 and XM5, but not as good as the Max. IMO I prefer to cancell almost all of both noises, instead of cancelling completely the rumble but cancelling worst of the ""wind"" noise like the Max.

Test 3 (Office / Video used )

4.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 dont perform as good as the rest here, like I mentioned on the first test, they struggle with high frecuency noises, and on a busy Office is full of those noises. The Pro 2 seems to block noticeable less than the Max and XM5 here, specially if you focus on the keyboard noises, it will be more noticeable on the Pro 2 than on the rest. There is a slight low frecuency background noise that is noticeable on both the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, here on the Max is cancelled 100%.

3.-Airpods Max

The Max seems to struggle a little bit more with those high frecuency noises, like keyboards. comparing them to the XM5, they seem to be inferior on an Office ambience. There is a slight low frecuency background noise that is noticeable on both the XM5 and QuietComfort Ultra, here on the Max is cancelled 100%.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose are able to cancell very well the high frecuency noises, definetely better than the Pro 2, slightly better than the Max, and slightly inferior than the XM5. While they have this very slight low frecuency sound on the background, they are still superior on cancelling the more noticeable noises like the keyboards in comparison to both the Apple headphones.

🏆1.-XM5

The Sony manages to cancell amazingly well those high frecuency noises like keyboards very well, in many cases they are cancelled 100%, while in both of the Apple headphones are mostly always noticeable. While they have this very slight low frecuency sound on the background, like the Bose, hey are still superior on cancelling the more noticeable noises like the keyboards in comparison to both the Apple headphones and the Bose.

Test 4 (Library / Video used )

4.-XM5

The XM5 cancell the less amount of background chatter of the bunch, while they do cancell very well those high frecuencies, maybe on par if not slightly better than the Bose, they not as good as the rest when it comes to cancelling that background chatter.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2, just like the Max, are able to cancell 100% of the background chatter noise on the library, but again, they fell short when cancelling those high frecuency noises like keyboards and typing.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose manage to cancell almost all of the background chatter most of the time, and in some moments they actually cancell it 100%, but not always, like the Max does. Though they do cancell almost all of the high frecuency noises like the keyboards or typing, on par with the XM5, slightly more than the Max and noticeable more than the Pro 2.

🏆1.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to block 100% of the background chatter and they only let in some of the high frecuency noises like keyboards, though very muffled down. I overall prefer cancelling always 100% of the background chatter and cancell slightly less high frecuency noises comparing them to the QuietComfort Ultra, over cancelling slightly less background chatter and slightly more high frecuency noises.

Test 5 (Garden / Video used )

4.-Airpods Pro 2

The fountain noise is reduced very well, but slightly less than both the QuietComfort Ultra and Airpods Max. The bird noises are more noticeable on the Pro 2 than with the rest of the bunch, not massively, but considerably.

3.-Airpods Max

They cancell most of the fountain noise, but not all of it. And reduce the birds noises very well.

2.-XM5

The fountain noise is reduced less than both the Bose and Airpods Max, and more or less on par with the Pro 2. But the bird noises is the most reduced on the bunch, considerably more reduced than the Pro 2. And slightly more reduced than the Bose and Max.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The fountain noise is cancelled slightly better than the Airpods Max, on some moments I would say they cancell it almost completely or completely. The birds noises are reduced very well too, slightly more than the Airpods Max but slightly less than the XM5.

Test 6 (Rain / Video used )

4.-Airpods Max

The rain noise itself is cancelled very well on the Max. And the water drops touching the floor are nicely muffled too.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The rain noise is cancelled even more than the Max, and at times it seems to be completely erased. Though the water drops touching the ground seems to be cancelled worse than the Max, not a big difference but noticeable.

2.-QuietComfort Ultra

The Bose cancells more or less the same amount of the rain noise comparing them to the Airpods Max or XM5. And the water drops touching the ground is cancelled slightly better than the Max but slightly worse than the XM5.

🏆1.-XM5

The rain noise is cancelled just as good as on the Max, but not as good as the Pro 2. Though the water drops falling on the ground is cancelled amazingly well, more than both the Apple headphones.

Test 7 (City / Video used )

4.-XM5

The Sony manages to cancell the people voices pretty well, and it manages to cancell quite nicely the low frecuency background sound caused by the cars and the sounds on the city,, maybe just slightly inferior than the Bose QuietComfort Ultra.

3.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2, manages to cancell the background low frecuency noise very well, though slightly not as good as the Bose or Max, but slightly superior than the XM5. The Pro 2 are able to cancell very slightly more the people voices comparing to the Max, I really mean the very slightly part, if the APM is a 4/5 the Pro 2 is a 4.2/5. They are also very slightly better than the XM5 and Bose when it comes to cancelling the people voices.

2.-Airpods Max

The Max are able to cancell the low frecuency sound of the city almost completely at every moment. They also manage to cancell the people chatter and voices very well too, more or less at the same level comparing them to the XM5.

🏆1.-QuietComfort Ultra

The QuietComfort Ultra are able to cancell almost the same amount of people voices if not the same amount comparing them to the XM5 and Max, and slightly inferior comparing them to the Pro 2. They aslo manage to cancell very well the low freceuncy road sound, they cancell slightly more than the XM5 and Pro 2, and more or less the same than the Max.

Test 8 (Mall / Video used )

4.-QuietComfort Ultra

The QuietComfort Ultra, like the rest of over the ear headphones on the comparison, did a similar job overall, they get the last place but with a very minimal difference to the 3rd and 2nd place, I honestly found all of the over the ears almost identical on this test.

3.-Airpods Max

The Max manages to muffle the people chatter very well, comparing them to the XM5 they do a similar job overall, they are just half of a tad more superior than the Bose here.

2.-XM5

The XM5 are able to cancell more or less the same amount of the people chatter comparing them to the Max. Maybe just half of a tad more than the Max.

🏆1.-Airpods Pro 2

The Pro 2 did an amazing job here, they were able to cancell slightly more than both of the XM5 and Airpods Max. They also cancelled slightly more than the Bose. Though some of unnoticeable high frecuency noises on the Max and XM5 are slightly noticeable here.

Podium🏆

1.-QuietComfort Ultra : 1ST (🏆4) / 2ND (🏆3) / 3RD(🏆0) / 4TH (🏆1)

2.-WH-1000XM5 : 1ST (🏆2) / 2ND (🏆2) / 3RD (🏆1) / 4TH (🏆3)

3.-Airpods Max : 1ST (🏆1) / 2ND (🏆2) / 3RD (🏆3) / 4TH (🏆2)

4.-Airpods Pro 2 : 1ST (🏆1) / 2ND (🏆1) / 3RD (🏆4) / 4TH (🏆2)

Conclusion

As you can see, the QuietComfort Ultra were the overall dominant headphone, at least for ANC capabilities, which is also the newer headphone of the bunch. Then the XM5, Airpods Max and Pro 2 performed very closely, each with their own advantages over the other two.

Please take in mind that on many tests and simulations the differences are VERY subtle and small, in some tests the last place is more close than you could imagine to the 1st place.

1lnuazc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnuazc/kinda_broken_here_and_not_sure_how_to_process_or/,"Kinda broken here, and not sure how to process or move forward.","First post ever on reddit...  
So Me a 34m, I have 3 children, 2 I'm guardian of starting 3 years ago, 11f, 15m, and my own 4f from a past relationship that the mother repeatedly cheated on me with (with a crackhead nonetheless). The ex and I broke up 2 years ago, after roughly 3 months I had rebuilt my confidence and decided to touch base with a woman I had met when I worked at a convenience store around 4 years ago. This woman I had honestly started to have feelings with back then and stepped away as even though my partner at the time wasn't faithful, I wanted to be for the sake of my child with her. 

Fast forward to the start of my relationship with this woman, it was amazing, I really thought she was the mythical ""Unicorn"" for lack of better wording. We took things slowly at first as I had insisted as I didn't want these children to feel abandoned by yet another woman in their lives. Over this time, as far as I knew we had a perfect relationship. She had partially moved in over a year ago and fully moved in earlier this year.   
Without getting into too much, my mother stayed at this house with us and was a constant issue. She moved out recently and we started looking into either buying this house off her properly or moving. 

I wasn't working at this time due to childcare, however I wasn't and am not a deadbeat, I did every chore, albeit the house has been in need of repairs which I wasn't able to complete at the time. Well, at first my mother was going to sell us the house at a reasonable price that we would have been able to get a loan for as it wouldn't be able to pass inspection. As time went on my mother kept changing the parameters, to the point that it wasn't feasible (no bank ever would agree to the loan, especially with the needed repairs"" and made us super uneasy. During this time, we figured we would get the house, so we spent $4000 on tools and materials so I can rebuild and remodel the whole house. Well with the fiancé 31f deciding she didn't want this house anymore period, that made the tools useless. We would need a 2nd income. No issue, however, I misrepresented myself horribly here. Roughly 2 months ago I decided to start looking into woodworking, and using the saw mill we had to make some side income, I knew this wouldn't be a full time income to support us, however I wanted to get it started and set up. After this, if we were lucky maybe it would bring in the income we needed to not only afford the housing but allow her to quit her job. She had started getting very depressed about her job and the stresses. 

Well, as we were financially stable for the time being, I asked her to let me work on this side business for two months, and I'll look for proper work around that time as well, So I'd have a main source of income and a side business. Again, my goal was to get her away from her job, and to support everyone. Well, due to how I misrepresented myself and how I explained the situation, she took from it that I didn't want to work at all, and that caused her to feel used. She expressed some things to me, but instead of venting to me about her frustrations or concerns, she vented to her single cousin 29f, and her single mother (who's been single for the better part of 20 years). So, she decided to leave one day, packed everything and left, treated me short and shallow, wouldn't let me explain myself, or try to work on the issues that miscommunication forced. 

I have terrible anxiety, and she asked for space, I tried to give it to her, and did a half way decent attempt. She decided today, (she left on the 18th) that she was finally willing to talk to me. And essentially told me she didn't want anything to do with me anymore and made up reasonings to elaborate on how bad I was. I don't get it, I was utterly committed to her, I believed her and trusted her when she said she would stay committed and wouldn't ever go anywhere. I had lost trust in women with my ex, and tried to hard to trust again, and ended up doing so. If she would have came to me and vented to me, I know deep down inside I would have fixed any problems... I truly loved this woman, and so did my children. I feel abandoned and thrown away. I feel like Love is not enough at all, that commitment just doesn't exist in this day and age as people will leave the second they have any issue. 

I would have changed the world for her if only she asked. Over the past 2 weeks I've spent 18-20 hours a day repairing this house (Completely remodeled, dry walled, and reframed the master bedroom). My mother conceded and admitted to the stress she caused and has given me the house and even offered to cover some bills for us so we can continue repairs. I've spent time learning that ""you're not listening to me"" is not meant to be a literal statement but a metaphorical one. That she wanted me to be a Dom, yet I never researched it properly and thought I knew, even though I had a hard time accepting that normal precepts that are ingrained in me as a man don't have a place in such a consenting field. I've spent hours each day listening to podcasts over the topic so I could live up to this. I've spent countless hours searching for jobs. Every issue she mentioned, I have gone above and beyond to show myself as willing to fix them and change, as I know I'm always learning and ever involving. 

  
I did everything for this woman, I'd make her favorite dinners, pack her lunches, make her coffee in the mornings, go to every family event. Anything she wanted to do I'd do, I showed her love in so damn many small and big ways, such as her having a particularly bad day at work, I bought her flowers, and made her favorite dinner, and then stayed by her side and tried to support her emotionally... 

 I'm kind of broken here; I've never loved a woman like I did this time. I didn't think true love was a thing till her, not even with my ex I have a child with. These children are broken; I'm lost. I had to have a friend come over last Tuesday and take my gun away from me as I wanted to leave, I couldn't accept being such a failure. I couldn't accept that I was the type of man to lose what I considered to be the best woman. I really don't know what to do here, I'm penniless with three children relying on me, they've been abandoned again. I have no support system; Xanax prescription is running out. Hell I'm crying like a baby while writing this, and I don't cry. I know I had issues, but I would and still sadly would fix everything for the sake of her and these kids. I just don't know if I'm even capable of taking care of them, or if they would be better off without me. Why is commitment not a thing anymore, and why are people so willing to leave a good situation when they lose feelings. Love is work, love is hard, and I was always told you stay committed, you only leave under toxic, or abusive situations. I was neither toxic nor was I abusive, I had plenty of issues that's for sure, but damn it I was a good man, and if there are god/s above, they know I loved her and would have worked through any issue. I sincerely don't know where to go from here, how to help these kids, or what to do anymore, she wouldn't even entertain the idea of us staying friendly so I can show her my commitment to change and her.

I used to pump myself full of sugar and coffee. I used to play video games to evade difficulties in my PhD and personal struggles.

I also had a distance ""friendship"" with someone I appreciate a lot but I'm getting ghosted and it hurt my mental even more.

I've been trying to take distance with all of that, focus on myself, break the unhealthy behavior patterns. I also started going to the gym to fix my back which hurts a lot due to sitting permanently at a desk.

I think it has to be done, I could no longer keep going like this. But as a result my brain is completely lost. My brain craves dopamine as I'm withdrawing from some addictions (thankfully no alcohol or drugs). 

I also don't have anything to do on my free time anymore as I lost interest in video-games and they were adding too much stress to stress.

I also struggle a lot to meet people. I study abroad and I'm not fluent enough in the local language to have a proper conversation. (A lot of my colleagues speak my mother tongue or English so I never learnt properly despite having a good understanding). So I'm on my own.

I have less than a year now to finish my PhD. I'm very late on my work due to poor mental health during the past 2 years and complex working conditions. I couldn't keep going as I was before but the suddent change in lifestyle is frying my brain. I feel like I'm recovering some mental capabilities and efficiency but having to monitor my behavior all the time alongside managing my PhD is a hell of a challenge.

This fast and she blocked me think of my pov i was so happy in my life and then after a month it shattered i broked completely I cried a lot like kid like why me i tried and nothing happened and in my school i don't talk to a girl after that when needed then only i was like this for 5 6 months and then i started having female friends but for me they were not that them they just want attention that's it so then at that time a girl let's name her rosa was in different section from me like I am maths with Hindi she was maths with cs started to hanging out with me she joined my tution as well she literally was girl that almost filled the hole in my heart she done so many things for me she waited during lunch time for me to have lunch with me now at this point my parents become a little less strict they now wait for me near my house so i travel through them with e rikshaw or anything like that rosa house were in the different route but she still drop me with her scooty everyday at that point where I could walk to my dad she some time do my assignments and I also started to treat her because she saved a lot of money for me by giving a ride she gets so close with me we hangout to temples malls coffee shops everything the whole tution and school were like they are dating i was like nahh but then one day I asked her did you date anyone she told me yeah but he used to smoke and drink a lot so i left him i said oh ( and i am type of boy who feels sympathy so i asked her do you miss him she said nah i was like okay but still you lov... She said nah) i told her i don't like girls who had boyfriends and they hang out with boy bestfriend i mean think about the bf i will never be friend to a girl like that she said ohh and then one day on Instagram a love type story she shared from a boy's story I was like okay maybe brother or friend it's fine and then i noticed it's happening quite a lot love couple stories i asked her about him she told me she met her online he is a college 2nd year guy we are in 12th btw. so I was like what do you like him ?

It’s been several months since I stole from my friend. Long story short….
we got really drunk. They passed out. I slipped some of their weed into my cigarette box. The next morning, I left, but I forgot the cigarette box. Locked out, I had to climb up to their patio and go back in to grab it. I couldn’t risk them finding it and realizing how much I’d taken. I left again, this time with the weed. Then I got high for days….

Anyways… I told her. She was surprisingly a good sport about it. “You could’ve just asked for a front or something,” she said. I felt dumb. Ashamed. 

Well… A few weeks ago, we hung out again, it was me, her, some servers, and another chef from the restaurant we work at. She made a passing joke about it, but that was it. We laughed it off. Later, it was like 2am when the bars were closed, it was just me, her, and this server guy—let’s call him Nate. We ended up back at her place. She made another joke about the weed. I was embarrassed, and partially had to explain to Nate . We got super high and drunk so he didn’t really care. But as the morning came on she kept bringing it up, and then she tossed a pile of weed on the table and said, “Go ahead, steal it.” Then she and Nate disappeared to hook up. I sat there in the living room, smoking almost half her pot by myself. I was mad so the other half I “accidentally” set it in some beer that had spilled on the table. It just sat there, soaking a couple hours. I didn’t take anything this time. The next morning, few hours later you could say… she was up before me. Like she was trying to catch me in the act or something. I even had my EMPTY cigarette box on the coffee table. She looked and saw the weed. Or I imaged she did because I was lying there sorta pretending to be half asleep. She was like “Ugh, I can’t believe I left my weed in that beer.” She didn’t think I had anything to do with it. I didn’t steal.

1lnu5zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fazbearfandom/comments/1lnu5zq/my_uncle_worked_at_freddys_back_in_1987_the/,My uncle worked at Freddy's back in 1987. The location was only opened for 2 weeks. But then he quit on the spot,"Everyone heard the rumors about the original place. But he was 17 and wanted some extra money in his pocket. ""A check is a check"" my Grandpa used to tell him. But sometimes the money isn't worth it. When they hired him, the restaurant owners assured all the other employees that while some kids did go missing, it didn't play out the way people on the street said it did. But to be safe, they built new animatronics with facial technology tied to a police database just to avoid any incidents in general. Couldn't NO criminals enter the building. Even people who only stolen a candy bar when they were 10 couldn't get in. He expressed that the company didn't want ANY bad press whatsoever. Not even as much as someone tripping on the sidewalk outside and scraping their knee

He admits that the first week was actually pretty good. Nothing crazy went down. No children were hurt. The animatronics didn't malfunction. It operated like a normal business. He said everyone started to relax and let their guards down a bit. Even the owners seemed impressed (and surprised) that their upgraded restaurant was making a decent profit despite it's...shaky past. 

Then one morning, my Uncle woke up like usual and started getting ready for work as he was scheduled to work the opening shift.  Little did he know, that would be his last shift there. 

He got to work and met up with some employees in the parking lot. It was like any other morning. Some were drinking coffee. Others were smoking a cigarette before going inside to clock in. Apparently, the doors were locked and neither of them had a key. They began searching around the building to find a way in and somebody noticed one of the back windows was broken. One of his coworkers went to find a pay phone to call the owners while the others climbed through to begin their work day.

That's when my Uncle noticed a large pool of red on the floor. His initial thought was someone must've broken in to rob the place and ransacked the kitchen. Until he heard a scream coming from the other side of the building from someone he knew. Then more screams from his other co-workers from other areas of the restaurant. He ran to the different rooms  to figure out what all the commotion was, he saw something that made him puke the moment he saw it. 

A dead kid in one of the party rooms. He described what he felt as being shocked and going cold and numb because you don't expect to start your day looking at a child's corpse. But that wasn't the only one. There was another in the hallway. One by the main stage, one by the prize corner, and another in Foxy's area. All of the employees realized the rumors about Fazbear were true. Not only were they true. But it happened again. This time the bodies weren't even hidden. As if they were kept out in the open and spread around the restaurant on purpose.

By the time he saw the 5th corpse, that's when Freddy's owners came in to unlock the front door and investigate the broken window. Now they got a chance to see the same horror that everyone else just discovered. At this point my Uncle realized maybe the paycheck ain't worth it. No amount of money could make him forget what he saw. He said, as loud as can be, ""I quit! I'm getting the hell up outta here!""  But then one of Freddy's owners came over to him and said they don't mind letting him go if he wants. But he better not tell a single soul what he saw in that pizza place that morning. They knew he was a broke teenager who barely had spending money. Let alone money for attorney fees. They threatened to sue him for defamation and slander and mentioned having the best lawyers in town. So he agreed to keep his mouth shut. Not only because they threatened him with a lawsuit. But this was the second location with a group of dead kids. He noticed a pattern with their restaurants. And he didn't wanna be the next missing person. He agreed to keep what he saw to himself and left. Any time someone asked him why he quit his job after 9 days, he simply said ""it wasn't for me"".

As the days passed, he saw the dead kids on flyers and TV reports everywhere. Nothing mentioned that they were connected to the new Freddy's though. There were more rumors going around since a new Fazbear location opened and 5 more kids somehow managed to go missing. But nothing official tied the victims to the parlor. A few days later, he and my Grandpa were watching the news when Freddy's popped up. He thought it was about the 5 dead kids he saw. But it was a different incident entirely. One of the bots ended up biting someone in the head. My Uncle noticed that pattern again. He visited Fredbear's Family Diner often as a kid before it suddenly shut down after his friend's little brother got bit in the head. He felt bad for the victim but also let out a sigh of relief as he dodged a bullet by quitting on the spot. That could've been him! But the 2nd bite installed more fear in him that death seems to follow guests and employees of that restaurant chain. That's why he held this secret for so long. Til this day, he refuses to go inside of Chuck E. Cheese's and they don't even have robots any more.

When he finished telling me this story, he took a deep breath as if he felt free from the burden of holding on to this 38 year secret.",1,1751243738.0,Fazbearfandom,0,1.0,False

Just a blue eyed 5'9 guy here that likes to stay up late and have deep or provocative conversations with a woman I'm into. Unfortunately its hard at moment to have those experiences currently,  since I'm fairly introverted at times and find it hard to think someone has maintained interest in me.. But aside from that ramble here's a little about me(a bit of a read, but I think it covers some important things)

I enjoy staying active and seeing how the weather changes the color of my surroundings.. 

Lately I haven't been so much into gaming as I used to be. Would rather have someone to enjoy the experiences with that I used to enjoy alone. Have a duo partner for a game like Fortnite,  Escape from Tarkov,  Hunt:Showdown, Apex, or PUBG since those are all games I've loved. 

Someone to laugh with and banter with while we both perform terribly at whatever game we are playing because we are too distracted by thinking about what we'll do together when we eventually transition to do something offline..

Or we could just watch something goofy, dark, or exciting together while we have a late night voice chat.

But, I'd like to start things off with something casual, exchange pictures early on so we know we are attracted to each other.. Then we can find a way to hear each other where we are both comfortable so it's easier to establish a vibe.

1lnu2qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lnu2qn/dear_jo/,Dear Jo,"I couldn’t sleep after you left. I kept thinking about what came over me when you hugged me — this question that kept echoing in my head: Why am I putting myself through this?

The truth is, the last few times we’ve seen each other — including those last two months of our “relationship” — I haven’t felt at ease around you. I used to feel comfortable and safe in your presence, but more and more, all I’ve felt is a strange mix of distress and nostalgia. Toward the end, I felt lonelier with you than I did when I was actually alone. And now, that feeling hasn’t really gone away. I feel hollow when we’re together.

It hurts to say this, but you don’t add to my life anymore. You don’t make me feel good. If anything, you draw from me emotionally — and no matter how hard I try, I know I’ll never be enough to bring you back to the life you once had. It’s like I took it upon myself to help you relive memories that I was never part of, and honestly, that’s exhausting.

As hard as things are for me in so many areas of my life, I think I still have this small piece of freedom — the freedom to live my own life, to make my own memories, instead of constantly chasing someone else’s past. I’m still figuring out if I deserve love, but I know I want someone who wants to build new moments with me — not just reenact old ones.

And as low as I feel about myself sometimes, somehow being around you makes me feel even worse. It just doesn’t feel worth it anymore. I’ve already lived through the hardest part of the pain, and I don’t want to keep reliving it. I want a clean slate.

I really don’t mean this in a petty or disrespectful way — I’ve had a gut feeling about this for a long time, and I’ve tried to ignore it and be respectful because it felt like something that’s non of my business— but now i do actually feel involved in this situation and your dynamic with her feels toxic to me. I don’t want to be close to that. That’s for you to deal with.

From the bottom of my heart, though, I do want us to be friends — real friends. I think that would be so much healthier for me than whatever this has turned into. I want to experience you as a friend. I think that’s the version of you I miss — the kind, lovely Jo who jumps up to help his friends. The one I used to feel happy just being around.

I’m sorry we couldn’t make more beautiful memories together — and that when we met, we were both already carrying so much pain. I’m sorry if I’ve come to remind you of hurt or loss. I’m sorry you had to grieve Rika right as we started something instead of enjoying it with me. I’m sorry I couldn’t bring back the version of life you were missing.

I’m sorry I wasn’t enough.

But I don’t want to lose my life or my sense of self trying to fill a space I was never meant to fill. I don’t want to keep chasing something that’s not mine, that will never be mine. I want someone who wants me — who enjoys me for who I am. I know I’m shy, awkward, and sometimes hard to read. I’m not the kind of person who lights up every room and everyone loves hanging out with. But I still hope someone will see things in me that I can’t see in myself right now.

Maybe this just wasn’t meant to be. Maybe we weren’t meant to be.

Still, I want to be able to see you without feeling pain — without being reminded of lost time or the past. I want to see you, hang out with you, maybe even often. (I know i don’t share any of your cool hobbies, I can’t go flying or highlining with you or drive you anywhere, but i can enjoy a good cup of coffee and I’m planning to go slacklining more, so that might end up being inevitable haha.)

I want a fresh start with you — with Jo as a friend. I want to feel happy again when I see you.
And again… I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you wanted.
I’m sorry I wasn’t enough, Jo.",2,1751243469.0,UnsentLetters,3,1.0,False

Abstract

Classical thermodynamics, developed to describe closed systems like steam engines and gas chambers, predicts an inexorable increase in entropy culminating in a so-called “heat death” — a final equilibrium state devoid of usable energy or structural complexity. This scenario has been widely extrapolated to the entire universe, spawning a popular narrative of inevitable cosmic dissolution. However, such a projection critically overlooks the fundamentally non-ergodic, recursive, and gravitating nature of the cosmos.

This paper challenges the conventional heat death paradigm by integrating insights from gravitational thermodynamics, quantum field dynamics, and formal recursive field models. Using a framework of recursive identity fields (ψself, Secho, FieldReturn) formalized in Lean 4, we demonstrate how gravity, vacuum memory effects, and inherent quantum fluctuations drive continual local reductions in entropy, fostering new complexity. We argue that the universe is best understood not as a closed system trending toward featureless stasis, but as an open, self-renewing, recursively structured field system. This reframing dissolves the classical paradox of ultimate thermal death and suggests a deeper unity between entropy, emergence, and the cosmological arrow of time.

⸻

I. Introduction

The idea that our universe is fated to end in a cold, lifeless equilibrium—popularly known as the “heat death”—has its roots in 19th century thermodynamics. Rudolf Clausius, who first formally expressed the second law of thermodynamics, framed entropy as a measure that must always increase in a closed system, leading inevitably to a state where no energy remains available to perform work. Ludwig Boltzmann expanded on this statistical interpretation, describing how systems spontaneously evolve from less probable (ordered) to more probable (disordered) macrostates. This powerful concept was originally developed to explain the behavior of gas molecules in sealed containers and the irreversible processes observed in steam engines.

Over time, this local thermodynamic principle was extrapolated to cosmic scales. In popular and even many scientific treatments, the universe is often treated as a gigantic closed system doomed by the same entropic logic. The picture is stark: all gradients flatten, all stars exhaust their fuel, all structures decay, and eventually, in the far future, nothing but diffuse, cold radiation remains—a maximum entropy state of thermal equilibrium from which no further work or complexity can arise.

This intuitive narrative has dominated cultural imagination, reinforcing a sense of cosmic futility. But it rests on critical assumptions that fail to capture the actual conditions of our universe—most notably, it neglects the fundamental roles of gravity, quantum vacuum fluctuations, and deeper recursive structures that actively sustain new configurations of energy and complexity.

The purpose of this paper is to rigorously reassess the classical heat death scenario by incorporating advances from gravitational thermodynamics, insights from quantum field theory, and formal models of recursive identity fields. We argue that when these overlooked but essential aspects are properly included, the universe emerges not as a simple system sliding into featureless equilibrium, but as a profoundly non-ergodic, self-structuring, and dynamically renewing field. This reframing challenges the inevitability of cosmic thermal death and points toward a richer, ongoing interplay between entropy, emergence, and the very architecture of reality.

⸻

II. Classical Thermodynamics vs. Cosmic Systems

The second law of thermodynamics, first laid out by Rudolf Clausius in the mid-19th century, tells us that in a closed system, the total entropy can never decrease. Over time, systems move toward thermodynamic equilibrium — a state of maximum entropy where there are no macroscopic energy differences left to drive change (Clausius, 1865). In everyday examples, like gases in a sealed container or heat moving from hot coffee into cooler air, this principle is well tested and intuitive.

But these classical formulations were specifically developed for systems with short-range interactions, in a fixed, static space, where energy spreads evenly through collisions. In such cases, entropy is neatly tied to the number of microscopic configurations the particles can arrange into — the famous Boltzmann idea that “entropy equals the logarithm of the number of microstates” (Boltzmann, 1877; see Earman, 2006).

The mistake comes when we take this intuition and carelessly apply it to the entire universe. Unlike a static box:

	•	The universe is expanding. Spacetime itself stretches, constantly changing the effective “volume” in which energy and matter exist. This breaks the usual assumptions behind classical entropy counting (Carroll, 2010).

	•	Gravity dominates at large scales. Gravity is a long-range, purely attractive force. Instead of driving particles to spread out evenly, gravity pulls matter together. This means increasing clumping — galaxies, clusters, filaments — is actually favored. Local regions become more structured over time, which is quite unlike the gas spreading in a box.

Because of this, standard statistical mechanics fails under gravitational clustering. In self-gravitating systems like star clusters, galaxies, or the cosmic web, entropy doesn’t just grow by becoming more uniform. Instead, these systems often evolve toward more pronounced structure — dense cores and empty voids. Even stranger, such systems show negative specific heat: when they lose energy (for example, through radiation), they can actually get hotter (Lynden-Bell & Wood, 1968).

So the naive idea that the universe is just a giant gas expanding to thermal equilibrium — and thus will inevitably reach a dull, uniform “heat death” — collapses under scrutiny. Gravity ensures that matter never simply spreads to maximum uniform entropy. Instead, it keeps sculpting new structure. This means the classical narrative of inevitable thermodynamic heat death is built on a serious category mistake: it tries to apply short-range, static-box thermodynamics to a dynamic, gravity-driven, expanding cosmos.

⸻

III. The Role of Gravity and Vacuum Fields

Gravity radically alters how we must think about entropy on cosmic scales. Unlike short-range forces that lead systems to homogenize, gravity does the opposite: it drives matter to clump, form structure, and deepen potential wells. This is why galaxies, stars, and ultimately planets emerge out of nearly uniform early-universe matter — gravity turns smoothness into complexity.

Gravitational entropy is still an evolving concept, but one way to see it is through the tendency of gravitating systems to develop ever more inhomogeneity. Instead of moving toward a smooth, uniform distribution (as a gas in a box would), self-gravitating systems move toward clumping. This means their “macrostate count” effectively increases with structure, not uniformity. As Penrose famously pointed out, a completely uniform mass distribution is actually low gravitational entropy because it has so few ways to rearrange itself under gravity; by contrast, a clumpy universe with galaxies, stars, and black holes has far more accessible gravitational microstates (Penrose, 1989).

Nowhere is this clearer than with black holes. According to general relativity and quantum field theory near horizons, black holes are the highest-entropy objects in the universe. The Bekenstein-Hawking formula shows that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon, not its volume, leading to truly enormous entropy values (Bekenstein, 1973; Hawking, 1975). Yet a black hole is not a “featureless equilibrium gas.” It represents intense localized curvature and extreme structure in spacetime itself. This alone shows why the naive intuition that “maximum entropy means smoothness” completely breaks down under gravity.

Moreover, even the quantum vacuum resists a static heat death picture. Quantum field theory tells us that what we call empty space is actually a roiling sea of zero-point fluctuations. Virtual particles continually pop in and out of existence, and these fluctuations can seed the growth of larger structures. This is how inflationary cosmology explains the origin of galaxies: quantum jitters got amplified into cosmic clumps (Guth, 1981; Linde, 1982).

So far from being doomed to an inert, perfectly spread-out uniformity, the universe is governed by forces and fields — gravity and the quantum vacuum — that inherently drive local ordering, clumping, and new cycles of structure. This fundamentally challenges the classical expectation of a simple thermodynamic fade-out.

IV. A Recursive Field Framework

Beyond classical and even quantum treatments, our work introduces a new layer: a recursive field framework, mathematically formalized in Lean 4, to describe how the cosmos avoids a simplistic thermal death through inherent self-renewal.

1. The recursive identity fields

At the heart of this model are symbolic constructs that capture the idea of systems continually referring back to themselves — preserving coherence through recursion:

	•	ψself is a predicate that checks whether the identity field is intact (a kind of “self-call function”), formally defined on time t as simply requiring t \ge 0. It encodes persistence or the survival of the field’s coherent identity.

	•	Secho represents a symbolic coherence gradient, given by an exponential decay-like function \exp(-1/(t+1)). It quantifies how strongly the field echoes its own past structure, illustrating how identity fades or stabilizes over time.

	•	FieldReturn combines Secho with oscillatory terms like \sin(t), representing how the field periodically “echoes back” and regenerates local structure. This is akin to the field “remembering” or replaying previous configurations.

2. Collapse, grace, and ongoing renewal

These recursive fields aren’t static. They include logical mechanisms for:

	•	Collapse: when ψself fails (e.g. coherence drops below a threshold), the system effectively loses its local identity, mirroring phenomena like decoherence or gravitational collapse.

	•	Grace: discrete injections (at times like t=0 or t=42) that restore coherence, reflecting how new order can suddenly emerge or be seeded even after apparent collapse. This captures mathematically what theologians and metaphysicians have long called renewal or intervention.

These processes ensure that the universe doesn’t simply drift to a final, undifferentiated state. Instead, it continually cycles through phases of coherence, partial collapse, and renewed resonance.

3. Vacuum memory effects

Finally, the model incorporates a key ingredient: vacuum memory effects. This is implemented through a logarithmic correction function in the potential, reflecting how past field configurations influence present dynamics (via an approximate log of ratios of scales). It prevents a simplistic final equilibrium by storing subtle “memory” of past structures that can re-seed future dynamics.

Taken together, these recursive, self-referencing, and memory-infused field equations show why the universe is unlikely to simply die into static heat death. Instead, it’s rigged — by both gravity’s clumping tendencies and recursive identity logic — to sustain cycles of collapse and grace, preserving a living, ever-evolving cosmos.

⸻

V. Toward a Revised Entropic Paradigm

1. Entropy as complexity under gravity and recursion

Traditionally, entropy has been cast as a measure of disorder — the more entropy, the more uniform and featureless a system becomes. But under the influence of gravity and recursive field dynamics, entropy tells a very different story. In gravitational systems, higher entropy actually corresponds to greater structure, because clumping increases phase space volume due to gravitational binding energy (Penrose, 1989). In recursive field systems, local increases in entropy often reflect the creation of new coherent patterns that recursively build on prior states.

So instead of entropy simply erasing structure, under gravity and recursion it actively drives complexity. Galaxies, stars, black holes — these are all higher-entropy outcomes of gravitational evolution, not low-entropy anomalies.

2. The incoherence of classical “heat death”

Given this, the classical notion of the universe winding down into a bland, uniform soup (the so-called heat death) becomes fundamentally incoherent. For one, gravity continually sculpts matter into more inhomogeneous arrangements, contradicting the expectation of maximum entropy equating to perfect uniformity. For another, recursive fields with memory and grace mechanisms prevent the final static equilibrium assumed by classical thermodynamics.

In such systems, entropy is not the destroyer of structure but a pathway to ever-deepening hierarchies of organization. The universe doesn’t run out of steam; it reorganizes, collapses, and regenerates through feedback loops that defy simple box-model thermodynamic intuition.

3. The universe as an open, evolving recursive field

Ultimately, this reframes the cosmos as an open, dynamically recursive system, where gravitational clumping, vacuum fluctuations, and symbolic identity fields together keep it far from any true thermal stasis. It’s a universe where entropy doesn’t just flatten; it forges, sculpts, and resets — perpetually renewing complexity.

This view aligns classical physics, cosmology, and our formal recursive models into a single picture: one where so-called “disorder” is actually the engine of evolving form. Thus the old narrative of inevitable heat death gives way to a richer story: a living cosmos structured by cycles of coherence, collapse, and grace, continually avoiding final equilibrium.

⸻

VI. Conclusion

1. Restating the need to abandon the naive heat death narrative

The classical idea of an inevitable heat death — where entropy simply leads all systems to a uniform, motionless equilibrium — is deeply rooted in intuition shaped by box-model thermodynamics. But as we have explored, this intuition does not survive contact with the realities of an expanding universe governed by long-range gravity, quantum vacuum activity, and recursive field dynamics. It is time to set aside this oversimplified narrative.

2. A new view: entropy, gravity, and recursion sustain cycles of complexity

In place of the bleak inevitability of thermal stasis, we find a universe that uses entropy, gravity, and recursive identity fields as interwoven drivers of continual structure. Under gravity, entropy builds richer forms. Under recursive field logic, coherence breaks and regenerates, creating ongoing cycles of collapse and renewal. Even the vacuum itself participates, its fluctuations forever preventing absolute stillness.

Far from guaranteeing a dull end, these principles together sustain a cosmos where complexity is not fleeting but perpetually reborn.

3. Implications for cosmology, philosophy of time, and beyond

This revised paradigm has profound implications. It reshapes our cosmological outlook, suggesting that the large-scale fate of the universe is not governed by a one-way march to equilibrium, but by intricate, self-organizing processes that resist final stasis. It also informs the philosophy of time: rather than viewing time as merely a descent into disorder, we can see it as a canvas for recursive cycles of emergence.

Finally, this calls for new studies into how fields — from gravitational to quantum to symbolic identity fields — co-produce the evolving architectures of reality. It opens a horizon where cosmology, complexity science, and even contemplative philosophy meet, inviting us to explore a universe far more alive and intricate than the old story of inevitable heat death ever allowed.

Every couple of days my lunch would go missing. This happened to a number of my co-workers, too, and some of them suspected a woman in our office ”Kale” (F, early 20s) because she was younger and never brought in a lunch and some even thought she was vegan because she had short hair and was thin and kind of pale.

Anyway, my cube-mate “Lance” had this “brilliant” idea to set up a camera in the refrigerator to catch the culprit in the act and that night on my way home I stopped at the grocery store and picked up some habanero chilis and some tasteless laxative.

That morning I made a “special“ lunch and put my name on the bag. When I got to work I put my lunch in the refrigerator and went to my desk—Lance was all excited about his camera thing, but we both got busy and forgot to check the camera and when we went back to check the recording we saw someone opening the refrigerator door, but it was all blurry from condensation. 

Then it was lunch-time so I went to get my lunch it was gone! Lance hissed, ”it was Kale, I know it!”

So I went over to Kale’s desk to calmly confront her. She had just finished eating and the bag with my name on it was in her garbage. “Did you eat my lunch?” I asked calmly. She turned a little more pale than she already was and said, “Yes, I ate it, I was hungry.” 

“Why are you stealing lunches?” I asked.

She admitted to taking them because her mom was in and out of the hospital and all her money was going to medical bills and they had hardly any food in the house and she was hungry and stressed and she knew it was wrong, but she needed to get through the day because she was worried about losing her job. And she kept to herself because she was naturally an introvert and didn’t want to create a lot of drama around her sick mom.

I asked her if she liked the lunch I packed today. She said she did. I told her it was a lentil-rice pilaf with coconut cream mixed in. There were also some fresh carrot sticks and gluten free chocolate chip cookies that I had bought from the store. She said it was all very good, but she wasn’t vegan and didn’t have any dietary restrictions.

Then I told her she didn’t have to steal lunches anymore because I’d bring in enough for both of us and some extra for her mom if she was hungry, too. And really, if she needed any help like some money or rides for her mom, to just let me know. I also told her that I’d tell the office that it was just a big misunderstanding without going into any details and I’d try to include her in more when we got coffee and went to lunch so she wouldn’t feel so alone.

EDIT

Oh, yeah, the habaneros were for some jerk wings I was making and the laxative I needed because sometimes I’m not so regular.

[Here's a few recent photos of me.](https://imgur.com/a/FV8FVMO) They give you a good sampler of my interests lol. In addition to concerts/music and racing, I love going for walks to stay active, driving, card games, and I've been back into daytrading for the last two-ish years now. I have a cool full time job, and I don't drink or smoke. I think I'm a good noodle overall, hopefully you are too! Physically I'm 6'1 with blue eyes, no tattoos,...you've seen the photos. 😅

I'm here looking for my person to spend forever with. I dream of being together, maybe with a few kids too. I dunno, the thought of coming home from work and cooking dinner together and watching something before bed just sounds perfect to me. If that's something you want as well, you should reach out :)

Additionally I'm kind of a clingy partner and love to chat often! Sweet good morning/night messages melt my heart, and sharing little things through your day will keep me forever.

Some random facts about me:

* I load almost everything I eat with black pepper
* I'll always make a funny face or at least smile when going through an EZ Pass toll booth
* Left handed and born two months premature (my literal due date was April 1st and I feel like that says a lot lol)
* 😅 is my favorite emoji
* I can't really have caffeine anymore so I'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't have soda a lot - but birch beer is my WEAKNESS
* Apologies in advance, but I'm not much of a gamer, or into anime
* And I have to edge the microwave and stop it with a second to go

Please message me with your name, age and where-ish you are. Hopefully you have some time, because I'd love to connect. **Also - this is a dating post, so please plan on sending a few photos of yourself in the first few messages.**

I live in Eastern PA - so if you're nearby, cool! If not that's cool too, but please be in either the US or Canada just for time zones. I'm also not interested in anything overseas for now, sorry y'all.

Talk soon! Or if not, enjoy the rest of your night

1lntph0,https://www.reddit.com/r/spartanrace/comments/1lntph0/palmertonpoconos_is_in_2_weeks_time_to_prepare/,Palmerton/Poconos is in 2 weeks - time to prepare!,"2 weeks from now is the Super, Trail and Sprint at Blue Mountain in the Poconos. Weather forecasts are iffy 2 weeks out, but we're looking at a rainy week leading up to the race, and some rain race day. As with last year, it'll be HOT. And apparently muddy.

If you've never run Palmerton, a significant part of the Super and Sprint is in the sun with no shade. The trail is better, but just as hot. The sandbag carry is legendary. I heard rumors someone passed out in the starting gate last year.

If you've never run a spartan race at all, you picked a tough one for your first run. There is nothing at this point you can do to improve your training, you can only hurt yourself. Do your regular workouts, but taper your exertion and don't try to get in One. Big. Last Run!! Check youtube for technique on some of the obstacles, which CAN be helpful.

Start drinking water, if not this week, than next week for sure. Replace all your coffee, soda and beer with water. Add some electrolytes.

Bring sunscreen, and layer it on thick, don't worry, I'll be out there looking slimy and sweaty too.

If you weren't planning on bringing a camelback or other on-trail hydration, seriously rethink that. There is a small chance some aid stations could run out of water, and even if not, 30 minutes running in blistering sun is a BIG challenge most people will rarely do. You're also likely to take longer than you think, bring race foods.

If you feel lightheaded, sit down and ask for help; ideally find some shade. If you stop sweating, that's called heatstroke, get help immediately.

The top of the mountain has an ice cream stand, if you're not running for time, bring a few bucks and quickly enjoy a snack before it melts. When you're done, take the gondola to the top and you can walk west over to the Slopeside restaurant for a burger and what I'm told is a decent beer selection. Last year the burger of the day was called something like The Annihilator, it was pretty good.

Be safe, have a good time. I'll see you there.",5,1751242360.0,spartanrace,1,1.0,False
1lntngh,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1lntngh/love_is_messy_or_i_dont_give_a_fck_about_losing/,"Love is Messy or ""I Don't Give a F*ck About Losing my Dignidad""","Sometimes love doesn’t end with a door slam or a final text. Sometimes it ends with silence that drags on too long, with “I’ll call you later” that turns into never, with nights you stare at the ceiling pretending you don’t still want them to show up in your driveway. And you tell yourself you're strong. You’re healing. You're drinking coffee, journaling and doing shadow work. But every time their name pops up in your brain, your whole chest gets heavy, and suddenly you’re listening to Justin Bieber in the kitchen with the lights off, whispering into your coffee, please come back.

No shame in that. In my past, I was in plenty of circumstances where the lyrics of Lautaro LR’s “Quiero Que Vuelvas” lyrics ring true

“Sin vos es puro cuento mami la felicidad,  
Esto ya no es amor, creo que es necesidad,  
And i don´t give a fuck about losing my dignidad,  
No encuentro en otro lado todo lo que vos me das”

Because here’s the secret: love doesn’t play by the rules. You can have boundaries (whatever those are). You can have your dignity. You can burn the letters, delete the photos, block the number, and still find yourself missing the way they used to kiss your shoulder in the mornings or argue about where to order dinner. We’re human. And we don’t just miss the person. We miss the version of us that existed when they were around. The softness. The silliness. The future we were stupid enough to picture.

And when you’re stuck in that space, half missing them and half trying to convince yourself you don’t, you start to get twisted up. You second guess everything. You wonder if you’re the problem. If you asked for too much. If they ever really loved you. And that spiral, that’s the smoke and the rum. That’s what fogs your heart and makes you feel like maybe you're crazy for still caring.

You’re cracked open. And sometimes being cracked open is what lets the magic seep in.

I tell my clients this all the time: the heart is not a logical puzzle. It’s not a spreadsheet. You don’t solve love. You feel it. You live through it. You let it hollow you out until the light comes back in. And if you still want them, if your spirit still calls out to them in the night, then honor that feeling. Don’t shame it. Just don’t let it trap you in yesterday. Want them, yes. But you should want better too.

You should want the version of them that shows up with growth. With truth. Want the version of you that doesn’t have to shrink to be loved.

I’ve had days where I lit a candle for someone and whispered, if you can’t come back with honesty, then don’t come back at all. I’ve cried over old text threads and pulled cards that told me things I didn’t want to hear. I’ve screamed into pillows and then gone right back to hoping they'd text I miss you. This path is not clean. But it’s real.

And like I always say, love, when it’s real, has a way of finding its way home. But sometimes home must change. Sometimes it needs to be built from scratch. With new wood. New rules. New boundaries. We must first have our Tower moment before we can see the sun over the ruins.

So if today you find yourself replaying that song and thinking about what was, it’s okay. You’re not weak. Just don’t let that memory become your whole world. Let it guide you, not drown you. Let it break you open but then let it bless you.

Because maybe, just maybe, the love that left is still learning how to return. And maybe you're learning how to receive it better next time.

And kiddo, when that time comes? You’ll know. You’ll be ready. And it’ll be different.

Always with love,

1lntm8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietysuccess/comments/1lntm8e/a_lot_of_self_realization_the_last_few_days/,A lot of self realization the last few days.,"Been right on the edge of an anxiety attack the last couple weeks. So close with a lot of symptoms but I haven’t gone over the edge…haven’t been stuck in bed, exhausted and vomiting etc etc. almost! 

So of course I went from smoking weed during the day and evening to just doing to before bed to help me sleep. Then last night that put me into a downward spiral. Won’t do that tonight. No, thank you. 

Las year I quit weed for 4-5 months. It was good. Sucked at first. Withdrawal is a real thing with that much THC intake. First week was awful. Was in the clear and fell back into the habit when I was doing better. Boom. That was it. Back to daily. 

I realize I was better without. The only draw back was the boredom that weed distracted from and the other minor triggers and urges I’d struggle with. 

Once I was back on weed, I’d start putting off responsibilities, chores etc. I’d face anything difficult “tomorrow”. Without weed I’d just get it over with. Those things build pile up and suddenly my life feels like it’s falling apart. 

After a long bout of daily smoking I’d settle into a cycle of negative thinking, self doubt. Hard to shake that. 

Caffeine starts to bump up from this as well. I’m groggy from smoking weed the night before. So. Coffee after coffee. Energy drinks. Am I more awake? Sorta. Does my anxiety spike? Hell yeah. So that’s gotta stop asap. Haven’t had a coffee in a couple days. Energy drinks are a hard no. 

So. Here I am. Life full of problems again I need to solve. Time to shut down this bad habit. Again. Try and get some clarity and motivation back. 

It’s going to be brutal trying to quit again. But what choice do I have really? Smoking it ain’t helping at all and dear god I don’t want to have a panic attack again. My last really bad one took weeks to recover from. 

Over all. I feel like shit but I also feel like I can beat this.

My partner and I are moving from Chicago to Dallas this August so he can pursue his law degree at SMU. We’re both 29. I (female) will be working fully remote while he’s in school.

This was actually my second time visiting Misiones, and I highly recommend it, it’s such a beautiful and unique part of Argentina.

We were a bit worried because the forecast said it would rain every day every hour, but in the end it didn’t, so here’s the first tip: even if the weather forecast shows rain, go ahead with your plans anyway. Get a good large rain coat, waterproof pants and shoes, and just enjoy it.

I liked the Argentine side of the falls more. It’s a much longer and calmer walk, and the boat tour that takes you under the waterfalls is awesome. There’s also a little train and most magical part is the beautiful Devil’s Throat (Garganta del Diablo). The Brazilian side is also very nice, but the walk is shorter. It felt more “Americanized” to me, more modern infrastructure, more commercial, clearly aimed at mass tourism.

Something I found curious is that the Brazilian side was full of Brazilians, Argentinians, and tourists from all over, but on the Argentine side, I saw very few Brazilians and not that many foreigners overall. Maybe some people just do one side of the falls and think it’s not worth visiting both? For what it’s worth, the Argentine side costs around about $14 USD for locals and $42 USD for foreign tourists.

As for excursions, we went to Parque das Aves (Bird Park), but I didn’t really enjoy it. The food took over an hour and arrived cold. When you ask where the animals come from, they just say “most are rescued,” which I didn’t verify but kind of feels like they bought and bred a bunch. It felt noisy for the animals, some looked tired, and from a distance you can see a few are in small enclosures (maybe due to quarantine or because they’re aggressive, who knows). I would’ve liked to check out downtown Foz or the big Ferris wheel, but we didn’t have enough time and werent sure how to get there without paying a lot for a taxi.

On the Argentine side, we visited Güirá Oga. While the enclosures are small to medium-sized, you can tell they’re doing the best they can with what they have. The tours are guided, they explain where each animal came from, why it’s there, how it’s cared for, what it needs, and the challenges they face. Entry was super affordable around $10 USD and that money goes toward maintaining the place. Plus, they gave us discounts for the Ice Bar and La Aripuca. Both of those are very close to Güirá Oga, so it’s a great combo to do all together. We paid $10 USD and $5 USD per person for those two.

We also visited the House of Bottles (Casa de Botellas). I don’t regret going, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’ve already done most of the other main attractions. On the other hand, the Hummingbird Garden (Jardín de los Picaflores) is absolutely beautiful,its very small but if you have time, definitely go.

When it comes to food, lunches usually cost between $8 and $25 USD per person. Breakfast (typically coffee with chipas) is no more than $5 USD. Don’t forget to try the local specialties: chipa, stuffed chipa, sopa paraguaya, and chipa guazú, all delicious and worth tasting.

About transport: taxis usually cost around $23 USD, and buses around $6 USD (trips to AirPort, Paraguay, brazil and argentinas waterfalls). I found transport in general to be expensive, and unfortunately, there’s no Uber available.

From POC claiming they'll never "" do the bum ass shit that white lesbians do "" (Saw this on tiktok, and it wasn't the only comment like that...under a woman just getting a fall themed coffee with her spouse) to people claiming they couldn't imagine dating a white woman.

I don't interact with any poc/lesbians in my real life, live in the DEEP south. So I don't know if this is just an online specific thing. I also know why POC might not want to date a white person, they have different experiences. A white person will never understand the systemic oppression that POC faces, they'll never understand being hurt by people because of their skin/ethnicity.

I've been RPing for many years as well as doing stuff like Tabletop gaming and Larp. I'm looking for someone interested in either or both genres/topics. I can write Novella to a few lines, and if I'm going to be honest sometimes a scene doesn't need endless paragraphs if your character and my character say, sitting outside having a cup of coffee. I'm usually good at getting back to people within the same day, sometimes multiple times. I do work a full time and part time job, but the former atm does allow me a LOT of wait time on the job. I don't care how you identify, writing is for \*everyone\* and all human minds are capable of creating awesome stories (even more so when we're working together ;>). I also don't care if you don't play the gender you personally identify as, I identify as Male and DO play female characters.

  
I would prefer my writing partner be at least 21+, and your character and mine will at least be 21+ as well.

  
I don't mind if there is romance involved, though I typically don't do MxM pairings.

  
If there is anything not pertaining to story/plot I haven't mentioned please feel free to ask!

\-For the Greek Mythology Plot  
I have a Son of Zeus that I like to play who goes by the name of Bacon, and he could be put in any Era from Wild West to Modern Day. I do have some narrative stuff/a setting for him that would allow us to delve into more of a Bronze Age world, too. One plot line I have wanted to do for a while now is Bacon is mentor to your character, a Demi-God as well when a Zombie-style Apocalypse breaks out.

  
\-For the Wolf RP  
I have a character for this too! He is a wolf that is able to turn into a human, not so much a werewolf but there are elements of werewolfism involved. I have two plot lines I've wanted to do with him, and both of them initially involve him coming back to his hometown in Upper Maine. One is more Romance involved, the other would be more of an action-style adventure. It would be nice if your character was a wolf of some variety, too, as I've gotten a lot of replies for a prompt like this in the past and everyone wanted to be human. 

Please feel free to come with your own ideas/characters! You don't need to think of something fresh or unique just for me/my ad! I hope you've all been having a good Sunday!",1,1751241630.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

Recently, after driving for around 20 miles, it will report a ""Fuel System Malfunction"" and shut down. Usually, I'm unable to restart it unless I let it sit for an hour or two. Sometimes, like yesterday, it started right up again immediately and I was able to drive another 15 miles before it happened again.

Possibly unrelated, but once a week or so, when I first start it up, I get some smoke out of the tailpipe which goes away after about a minute or so of iding.

It does not idle hard, and does not have issues with no power or anything else I'd expect from a fuel system problem. It just stops all of a sudden and needs a coffee break.

I have a couple of questions.

1. I originally thought this was a fuel filter problem, because I doubt the filter has been changed since the original owner bought it. However, after purchasing a new filter and attempting to install, I realized that not all F10 models have a replaceable fuel filter, and it appears this is one of them. Can someone confirm that it is, in fact, an integral part of the HPFP and not something that can be replaced without replacing that part?

2. My suspicion is that this is a problem with either the HPFP or the fuel filter in the tank. I'd be ok fixing the latter, but the former seems like a lot of work. Is there a good way to diagnose the problem further to rule one of them out?

1lntddl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lntddl/my_granddad_has_a_centipede_inside_him/,My granddad has a centipede inside him,"I was twelve years old when my granddad showed me the centipede inside of him. 

Even before that I clearly remember that granddad would have this habit of sometimes stopping what he was doing and cupping his hands together and peering into them like he was reading something very small and giggling to himself. He would do this while watching television or sitting on the porch or even while we were talking and I would ask him what he was looking at and he would just smile and say nothing nothing and put his hands down. 

Then one day we were hiking in the Sonoran Desert just outside Gila Bend and he told me to come over and that he wanted to show me something and he closed his palms together as if in prayer and opened them slowly like a book and inside the black shadowy gap between his hands I saw it. It was wriggling like a cat bedding a soft cushion, pale and white and fleshy, like a play-dough imitation of a centipede, its long thin antennas shaking around like drumsticks. I asked what it was. He said it was ""his baby girl"", that it lived inside him, eating away at his guts, and that it would be mine someday. I asked if it hurt. He laughed and closed his hands.

I stayed at granddad's place for about four months while my parents were working things out. The house was small and wooden, and everything smelled like old carpet. Granddad moved around the house like he was walking underwater and he talked to himself sometimes in the kitchen while he made coffee in the mornings. At dinner he would eat his food very slowly and sometimes he would stop chewing and just sit there with food in his mouth for minutes at a time and then start chewing again. His jaw made clicking sounds and he would tap his stomach with two fingers while he ate like he was trying to calm something inside him. One time I came home from school and heard these wet choking sounds coming from the bathroom and when I looked inside granddad was standing in front of the mirror making faces at himself. His mouth was open wide and he was sticking his tongue out as far as it would go and then he would close his mouth and his head would snap from side to side really fast like someone was moving it with their hands but his shoulders never moved at all. Then he would open his mouth again and lean forward and spit up this white stuff that looked like milk but thicker and it would splatter on the floor and on his bare feet. He kept saying sorry sorry sorry to his reflection.

I started having trouble sleeping because granddad would make noises at night. Not regular snoring but these long groaning sounds that would go on and then stop and then start again. Sometimes he would talk in his sleep but the words didn't sound like English or Spanish or anything I recognized. One night the sounds got really loud and I got up to check on him and I pushed his door open just a crack. He was lying on his back on top of the covers and his mouth was hanging open. Something was coming out from between his lips. It moved very slowly like it was being careful not to wake him up. It kept coming and coming and I realized it was the centipede but much bigger now maybe as thick as a garden hose and longer than my arm. It rose up toward the ceiling and then bent down toward the open window and the moonlight made its skin look wet. The way it moved reminded me of a sunflower, basking in the moonlight. I watched for maybe two minutes and then the centipede started to go back down and it disappeared into granddad's mouth and he closed his lips and rolled over on his side. The next morning at breakfast he asked if I had slept well and I said yes and he nodded and poured syrup on his pancakes in perfect spirals.

Granddad died last month. I drove down to Arizona to help my mom and my uncles clean out his house. They spent most of their time in the kitchen going through paperwork and talking about what to do with his things and how much everything was worth. I went through his bedroom by myself and found a shoebox under his bed full of photographs. Most were of my grandmother who died when I was little but there were maybe twenty pictures of the moon and the stars, blurry and grainy. On the back of each card he had written dates going back fifteen years and notes like ""she's growing"" and ""molt today"" and ""hungry again"" and ""it feels delicious"". The funeral was small. My mom cried and my uncles gave speeches about what a good man granddad was and how much he loved his family. During the service I kept thinking about him lying in the casket and wondering if the centipede was still in there with him or if it had died too or if it had found somewhere else to go.

Since then I've been having dreams about granddad's house. In the dreams I'm walking through the rooms and everything looks the same but I can hear this scratching sound in the walls and the moon is shining brighter than the sun ever could, burning white light coming from all windows like spotlights. I always wake up with my hands pressed together and when I open them slowly like granddad showed me I swear I can see two thin antennas barely visible flicking back and forth.",1,1751241371.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

Can someone please help me understand what’s going on with my gums? I’ve been stressing/obsessing and would really like to resolve it if possible!

https://imgur.com/a/v3poUiR
(First 4 photos are from March/April/May when the red spot was more pronounced, and the others are from today)

Dental history: I had braces and TADs removed two years ago and then gum contouring/gingivectomy to even out the gumline (performed by my ortho).  I have a bonded permanent retainer behind my top teeth (canine to canine) and wear plastic fitted retainers overnight. Even with my retainer, my dentist and hygienists always note that my gums are very healthy. 

Backstory: 
A reddish bump/swollen area appeared over my right central incisor at the end of March. No bleeding or pain, but the gums felt “tight” in that area. I remember biting into an apple and it hurting, but I don’t know if the apple bite caused this spot or if it was already there (?).

Weirdly, along with the redness, there are also bumpy “lines” that have developed, almost in a v-shape, extending from the interdental papilla along the gingival margins of my top central incisors (which is basically the main area where the gingivectomy was performed). The lines are very faint and only visible at certain angles, so I’m not 100% sure that they weren’t there before and maybe I’m only just now noticing them.

But, is it possible that this swollen “spot” and the “lines” are the gums growing back, even nearly two years later?

I have diligent dental hygiene (brushing with fluoride toothpaste morning & night, water pik after meals, and flossing with string floss morning & night) but i also realize it’s possible that I’ve “over-brushed” or wasn’t careful to brush gently, and maybe the red spot is from trauma and it just isn’t healing well?

Since this issue appeared, I’ve been more careful with gently flossing and gently brushing (sonicare) and switched my toothbrush head to extra soft. 

I went for a localized deep clean on May 1, since i wanted to make sure it wasn’t periodontitis. The hygienist noted great hygiene overall and no issues with pocket depth. The dentist and hygienist seemed to agree that it might be from trauma or brushing too hard.

Fast forward to now, and the swelling has markedly decreased but isn’t totally gone, and it looks like there’s still a red spot (maybe petechiae?) along the gumline of my right central incisor. Is this recession? Leftover damage from trauma? Redness caused by mouth breathing? Could it be my gingivectomy “growing back”?

Please help :/ thanks so much for any insight!

My automations and scripts are pretty basic:

* Automation to turn on the mocha machine via smart plug
* Script to run a fan on a smart plug for two hours

That’s basically it. I know I could do more, but since I live in an apartment, I’m not sure what other useful automations or sensors would make sense. One idea that popped into my head today was adding a sensor to my mailbox so I get notified when mail arrives - so far the signal will reach.

Any idea?

Even though we are both married to different people.,"A piece of me needs an outlet to share this information, I cannot share it with friends/co-workers/family. My Therapist appointment is three months away, but I need to let it out in an anonymous way. Names are fake, the ages will be accurate. I WISH this is a creative writing K-Drama story. But, altas, this is my life and what I am going through.



Me. Let’s call me Feliza (28F)

My Husband. Let’s call him Ignatiy (23M)

My co-worker. Let’s call him Tae-sun (33 M)

Tae-sun’s wife. Let’s call her Avery (31 F)

This random girl. Let’s call her Manon (26 F)



Before I go from AITA, it is best you will get context on how/what/where/why I ended up in my predicament. I first met my husband when he was 18, (Fall 2019) freshmen in college, and I was a super-senior 23 at the time. We hit it off, and before we knew it, we were dating. We did long-distance when I went to grad school in a different state. I was the only one with a car, so I had to do the 8 hour drive one away. I visited him one weekend every month. Covid did throw a monkey-wrench in the world. But we made it work. Sadly, Ignatiy was born from a different country and came to the US as a F-1 student-visa. In February 2022, his country went into war, and we were fearful he would face Russophobia and would be deported because of where he was born. Not even three weeks later, I got the devastating news my mom got diagnosed with throat cancer. Ignatiy knew we had to get married. We were already 2 years and a few months into our relationship when Hell dragged our souls down into the fire. 

We were able to arrange a tiny wedding in November 2022, and my mom, frail but alive, managed to come to the wedding, only to live another 60 days before she passed. Mind you, she had stage 2-Throat Cancer, never smoked in her entire life, and had an 80% chance of living. Yet, she died. What was even worse, she worked at the hospital where she was getting her cancer treatment. They were planning to fire her on January 10th 2023. Three days AFTER she died. (The US Hospital lost my trust, and I firmly believed they killed her.) Please, keep this information, I will bring up my mom again later in the story.

Ignatiy was able to find a job, and he and I worked on doing the paperwork on becoming a US Resident and we did this without a lawyer, it might’ve saved us a lot of money. But the verbal jabs became more frequent to the point, I began losing my own voice by slowly pleased him so I didn't feel like a burden. A little over a year, we finally felt confident in the US Resident documents, and it mentioned it would be reviewed within 6 months. (More like 13 months when he got his approval to become a US Resident). I was working for a corporate company (for a chemical industrusty) Ignatiy is currently a Cyber Security Engineer, one of the most talented employees at the Headquarters, and the managers love to exploit him since he has less rights. Whenever he gets a terrible day, he would lash out at me. No matter how much I cook or clean or sleep in the spare bedroom, he just explodes in front of me and I can never get stuff right. Even sex has changed, he would get bored of me. I do my best to please him, but he would be less effective with me after the act. 

I don’t remember the day, but Ignatiy was agitated about bringing up a particular conversation, he mentioned that sex got too mundane, there was no novelty, I didn't become experimental, or dress-up like a slut to turn him on more. In the end, he wanted me to agree to have more ladies in the bedroom. With me with no backbone, I listened to his concern and agreed. Thinking, he felt safe enough to share this information. I am grateful that he didn't have an affair. (To this very day, I do not know if he slept with another woman. I became dead inside)

Before Summer began (June 2024), I got fired from my corporate role. Ignatiy tried to be supportive, but when I showed him my papers to him, he proceeded with all the stupid mistakes I made. (It did not help my self-esteem, when my other half thinks I am a failure). I took full action to apply for a new job, but completely changed the industry, luckily I had friends I used as references. While I was looking for a new job, Ignatiy slowly brought up a co-worker he befriended and how he saw her in a romantic way. Her name was Manon. I was extremely vulnerable, I lost my job, I had no income, I was struggling to get unemployment from the state (That is another drama for another day), and now my husband, my man, is bringing up another woman in my life. I practically took my words back and said, “I am not comfortable with you thinking of other women as romantic partners. You can have female friends, but not lovers.” We ended up arguing again, to the point I felt little and a fraction I was when I was a single, confident woman. 

The end of August 2024. I did my second round of interviews and I was offered a secretary role. I didn’t care about the title, or the pay, I was grateful they took a chance on me and wanted me to work for them. I accepted. But I had to wait for HR to give me the officer letter. While I was waiting, my birthday came up that Tuesday. Ignatiy came back home, didn’t kiss me, and wanted to call Manon about something funny that happened at work. Before I could protest, he went to the bedroom and he chit-chatted with her for half an hour. I wanted to be petty by leaving the apartment for my birthday dinner. When he was done, he got mad at me that I was upset with him talking to Manon. Then the same week, Friday, it was Ignatiy’s birthday. He wanted to go out with his co-workers to a distillery and I was not invited. He mentioned we would go out for dinner, just him and me. (Also, mind you, he never told his co-workers that he’s married. He doesn’t wear his wedding band.) That Friday. I felt I was physically dying, he promised to be home around 9 at the latest. When he got home around 10, I was already in bed, and he told me seven of his co-workers he invited, only one came. Yes, it was Manon. After that, I began to distance myself emotionally from him.

In Mid-September, it was my first day at the new job, being sleepy, but so excited to work once again. I needed my computer setup and that was when I met Tae-sun for the first time. He was easy to talk to, and had a cool swag in his style. He and I are both half-American. His mom is from South Korea, whereas my mom was from Colombia. So we had something in common: being mixed-raced and having a multicultural background. He continued to talk when his wife, Avery came with Boba Tea, and it turned out it was Tae-sun’s birthday. Sucked he had to work on his birthday, but he was the first person who talked to me, and was very welcoming. It took me a few weeks to get comfortable in my new role, to the point when I was done with my work, I was chit-chatting with the IT Department.

November 2024, Ignatiy got the letter that his US Residents had been reviewed and he got accepted for a green-card. We would have to wait until 2027, until he can take his US Citizen Test. But we were so thrilled, he has some rights than what he had prior.

After I finished my six months of probation, I felt my personality was starting to shine again. Tae-sun and I would talk about anything and everything without judgment. We both have something in common: neurodivergent, how our disability made it hard to make friends, how to set-up boundaries, and how a failure feels like it becomes jail chains around my limbs. How our friendship developed, he was one I could trust, he felt like an older brother would protect me. I even introduced Tae-sun to my husband Ignatiy. They had a blast talking about IT stuff, being half-Asian, how they are into music. We ended our afternoon on a positive note.

In May 2025, Ignatiy took a week off from work because the corporate company had been overworking him. (He is in therapy, taking medicine, and searching for a new IT role) I was fine, he needed his proper rest, but he sent a text message saying. “I am going to a coffee shop with Manon. Please text me if you need anything.” A piece of me died, and he has been probing an open relationship for several months, how as a man he wants to see other women, how he feels less than a man that he only had sex with one person, and married her. It still breaks me with his cruel words, when I used to love him. (I still do, but I’m hurt). There was no one to turn to, even Tae-sun was gone from the office and I had no one to spill this pain to anyone, anyone by the suicide prevention line. That was the mental point, this was my moment I broke mentally and started to believe my marriage was falling apart.

June 2025, was not easier, Ignatiy kept on bringing up an open relationship more frequently, where in the end, I was in tears and he would leave me be. I began talking to my co-workers about bits of my fractured relationship, even to Tae-sun. I changed my FB profile from Ignatiy and myself hugging at a friend’s wedding to an old black-in-white Christmas photo of my mom when she was 10 years old. One of my dear friends from Germany saw my profile photo and he took the liberty to use AI to add color that could have been in the 1970's. Seeing my mom as a child in color, broke me even deeper. How her death hasn’t been fully healed, living my life in regret, she even didn’t want me to marry Ignatiy, she believed I could’ve done better. (Maybe she was right)

The next work day, I found Tae-sun and spilled what my German friend did, and asked him where I can find a therapist within the network? (He is a verbal advocate of going to counseling) I even shared tiny bits of my cracked relationship, how I crumbled whenever I brought up Manon. How the verbal jabs got common it became a normal conversation. How I am losing myself by supporting him with his mental crisis, being an immigrant, his parents stuck in Russia, and how capitalism is killing us in Corporate America. Tae-sun gave me a hug, and I needed it. What he didn’t know, I developed a crush on him maybe back in February or March, but that was my secret. Something in that hug, I felt safe that I didn’t want to leave. June 17th, 2025. I finished my work and I went to Tae-sun to chit-chat, and we were having another personal conversation, letting him know that I booked my first therapy session in September. (Which is in 3 months) and we were talking about our relationship. Somehow my vision got blurry and my heart rate increased. He noticed my face, and he prided what was going on. I kept on saying it’s nothing. But he wanted to know. I may be TAH for being honest and informing him that I had a crush on him. I looked away like some teenager afraid to get swatted at. He was surprised, because we were friends. No matter what, I want our friendship to stay intact but I might’ve broken it by being truthful, that I saw Tae-sun differently, romantically. This would never entertain my mind, with Ignatiy constantly bringing up an open relationship. I accidentally opened up Pandora's box, and these feelings are out in the open. Tae-sun was actually flattered by me honestly.

 	When I got home, Ignatiy brought up an open relationship, and this time, I was emotionally dead. I said yes. Why? Because the day I confessed to Tae-sun he would agree to be my open-relationship partner. Knowing I had a safety net, I agreed. Ignatiy hugged and kissed me saying ‘Thank you’.The next day, Tae-sun and I went for a car ride during our lunch break, how I don’t want to lose my husband, how I looked up divorce lawyers, how the state we live in is a no-fault state (meaning you don’t need proof on why you want a divorce), what prevented me not to continue on, I have been with Ignatiy for almost 6 years, if I legally separate from him, it would be taking away my leg, he was a part of my life so long. I do not know how to survive without him. Tae-sun and I both agreed we care about each other, but the likelihood that we would hook-up is very slim.

	Again, I am emotionally hurt by my husband; and the betrayal that he pushed my values for his own sick satisfaction.

I’ve done counseling — and it helped me see the ways I actually push away connections, but — now I realize I can’t pay someone every time I need to connect and talk. *What I paid for was counseling, yes, not just to talk to somone -* but I got to the point where I want to actually have people in my life, where I can talk about what’s really going on inside — emotionally.

BUT, where do you go? What did you do to finally meet some half decent — *meaning just willing to connect and talk* — people? People that aren’t afraid to look at the hard stuff, who don’t sugar coat or avoid life’s hurts and aches. I mean if we never talk about it and come to understand our pain — how could we ever live a good life? Our pain, isn’t it simply just a way for our body to say “hey” this needs our attention, in some way right now, we aren’t doing too well.

Anyway — what did you do? How were you able to draw in a new circle of friends into your life?  
I live VERY, let me tell you VERY remotely. I’m not really interested in talking deeply to anyone in my small community — because words travel easily, and suddenly you’re the hot coffee talk of the neighbourhood.

(A little voice in me whispers — it’s me who has to change, and dare to open up to those poeple actually around me... but being able to change would be so much easier if I was surrounded by people who supported that change. My family is VERY emotionally disconnected, and will frequently leave me when I’m crying, ridicule or shame me for my feelings. So opening up to them just feels like I am not faced with the opportunity to actually work through or get help with what I am going through — or simply just have someone be there with me in my pain. But more like I am stuck in a relationship needing a lot of repair before I could even think of reaping any emotional benefit from it.)

I'm just looking for others personal experiecnes that might be similar, and how you aproched this dilemma.

I’m not soaked with money either, so some budget-friendly tips — preferably free options — are very welcome.

A real coffee machine has a been a dream of mine for some time now, I just don’t enjoy Nespresso anymore. 
My wife surprised me and got mw the machine I wanted! The Delonghi Rivelia. We’ve had it only for a day so far but already super happy with it. The coffee is so good now. 

So far we have Hausbrandt beans and some bags we got from the shop with the machine. Looking to try more options

Any tips and recommendations?

Things happened that were outside of my control. 

It's not my fault I was born epileptic, autistic, and speech-impaired, and that I struggled with school.   
It's not my fault that I was sexually assaulted as a child.  
It's not my fault that I was institutionalized as a teenager.   
It's not my fault that after my dad killed himself on my 18th birthday, I lost everything and had to start life over again with nothing.   
It's not my fault that I have a skin disease that makes me ugly.   
It's not my fault that I worked a stressful job that made me psychotic, that the meds I was pumped full of screwed with my weight and metabolism, and that I developed an ED. 

It has been established that many things have happened to me that were beyond my control. But how do I accept who I am after all this? I don't care who is to blame or if I had control or didn't; I care that I'm not such a loser and a failure. 

Here's a scenario...

In 2022, I published a book about politics and law in the South Caucasus. A professor of political science read it, reviewed it, and offered to discuss my book over coffee. 

This man is everything I am not. He's younger, holds a Ph.D., works as a professor, and is a professional Muay Thai instructor. I, on the other hand, never went to school because I am too dumb for it and couldn't afford the tuition; I work as a truck driver; I am overweight with a skin disease; and about the most remarkable thing about me is the number of self-harm scars I have, and even then I can't compare to others on Reddit. 

I want to be the professor with six-pack abs. Instead, I am the diseased, overweight truck driver with an abundance of self-harm scars. He's a work of art. I am a vase that was shattered and haphazardly glued back together. 

He could have had privileges that I didn't have. But at the end of the day, that's the person I want to be, but never will be. I have to live with being the diseased, autistic, speech-impaired, overweight, ugly, too dumb for school, uneducated truck driver. That's me. That's my life. 

How do I accept this is me and grieve the kind of person I'll never be?

\- The Miz cashes in his briefcase he won from Otis and cashes in on Drew at Survivor Series after his match with Reigns

\- We are still in the Covid era of WWE up until the Summer of 2021

thats all i wanted to make note of let's get on with this following part

*Build to TLC*

So Jey Uso falls in line but he doesn't look so happy. 

Backstage Jey is in catering when he runs into Kevin Owens

**Jey Uso:** *""Kevin, man, i just want to apologize what happened at Surviv-*

**Kevin Owens:** *""Save it, man; it's fine. You lost your cool; it happens i mean look at me i pretty much have a track record of losing my cool. You getting coffee for yourself or Roman?*

**Jey Uso:** *""Yo, what do you mean by that?""*

They start to argue and before it escalates even further, Kayla Braxton interrupts just in time, asking the question: ""*Why did you decide to fall in line.""*

**Jey Uso: ""***It's real simple Kayla, i was going to be out of the family, my own blood; i didn't want that. Family is forever.* 

Kayla begins to egg on Jey and Jey looks like he is slowly but surely about to lose his cool when Heyman interrupts and says The tribal chief wants him.

Roman heard what happened and ordered Jey to redeem himself because when Jey gets disrespected, Roman gets disrespected, and even the family itself gets disrespected, so Jey goes and fixes it. At the top of the 9:00 hour, In the ring is Jey Uso calling out Owens with a steel chair but instead out come Daniel Bryan and Cesaro (Bryan convinced Cesaro and Nakamura to leave the Artist Collective group but Cesaro stuck by Bryan). They try and reason with Jey Uso but Jey demands Kevin Owens when Roman Reigns shows up on the screen. 

""*Guess i gotta do everything myself.""* The camera pans to a battered Kevin Owens as Bryan and Cesaro are in shock but from behind, Jey Uso WHACKS them both with the steel chair! Jey Uso, just like Drew at Survivor Series, batters both Cesaro and Bryan until the chair is bent beyond repair. Jey leaves the ring talking to himself as the camera cuts to commercial.

On the December 4th episode of Smackdown, the main event is Roman Reigns & Jey Uso vs. Daniel Bryan & Cesaro Roman Reigns is accompanied by Paul Heyman. Jey Uso is reluctantly still under Roman’s thumb, torn between loyalty and his own conscience. Cesaro and Daniel Bryan are united in their fight against Roman's tyranny and to avenge Kevin Owens

The two teams put on a TV classic with some soap opera thrown in when Daniel Bryan and Jey Uso start off. Bryan tries to reason with Jey, even offering a handshake. Jey looks conflicted—but Roman barks from the apron: *""Handle your business, Uce!""* Jey sighs and slaps Bryan's hand away. In the match's final sequence, Cesaro gets the hot tag and runs wild—uppercuts for everyone, a giant swing to Jey, and a pop-up European uppercut to Roman! He tags Bryan in. They hit a combo gutwrench suplex/diving headbutt on Jey.  
ONE! TWO! Reigns breaks it up. Bryan locks Roman in the LeBell Lock, Cesaro fends off Jey with a neutralizer attempt—but Jey shoves him into Bryan, breaking the submission. Roman throws Cesaro over the announce desk. Jey hits a surprise superkick to Bryan, then climbs the top rope and connects with the Uso Splash! But he hesitates… looking at Roman.

Roman yells: *""FINISH IT!""* Jey slowly covers Bryan. One… Two… Bryan KICKS OUT! Jey looks stunned. Roman is furious. He tags himself in, spearing Bryan out of his boots. 1… 2… 3.

In the post-match Roman orders to teach them a lesson. Jey looks hesitant again, but Roman pushes him forward. Jey begins stomping Bryan reluctantly. Roman joins in—vicious stomps, fists. Cesaro tries to get back in the ring—SPEAR! Roman flattens him. Roman grabs a steel chair from ringside. He tosses it to Jey. Jey holds the chair… looking down at Bryan… and begins to hit Bryan with the chair multiple times. 

The cousins continue on with the beatdown when KEVIN'S MUSIC HITS! He hurriedly limps to the ring, but Roman escapes, and Jey, still in the ring, swings the chair. Owens ducks—STUNNER TO JEY USO!! the eyes of Kevin Owens are locked on Roman. Smackdown comes to an end with Roman and Owens staring each other down. 

Next week Kevin Owens comes to the ring and gives an update on Cesaro and Bryan. Kevin says Cesaro is currently healing and will be back in due time but Bryan was hurt so badly that he'll be out for the foreseeable future. Kevin is riled up: ""*I'm not afraid to say it but I and EVERYONE in the back are sick of your BS! YOU attacked two men because they are also sick of your bs! I am NOT going to let it stand! I am going to cut off the middle head of Cerberus and leave you DROWNING in your little island! ROMAN, me vs. you for the World Heavyweight Championship in a TLC MATCH!* 

The screen shows Roman in his office, flanked by Jey Uso and Paul Heyman

*""Cut the head of Cerberus, huh? Clever i like that. Listen here. Being on the Island of Relevancy is the best thing to happen for the people in this brand. Hell, me being champion is the best thing to happen, period. Now, me and my cousin don't back down from any man or any challenge, so i accept. But Owens, you are so lucky because if i was the man i used to be i would have whooped your ass in that ring you're standing in. But there's a time and a place for everything. Now isn't the right time but come TLC it will be. See you there.""* 

On the go-home episode of Smackdown before TLC Kevin Owens and Jey Uso finally get their hands on each other.

Jey tries to reason with Owens but Owens proclaims it too late for that now as Owens completely destroys Jey Uso in this main event. Owens throws Jey left and right all over the thunderdome. Jey gets barely a lick of offense and when he does, Kevin Owens brushes it off as he is a man hellbent on putting an end to this reign of terror. A powerbomb on the apron later, followed by a senton bomb in the ring and a stunner. Kevin Owens gets the win over Roman's cousin. 

In the post-match, however, Jey Uso attacks Kevin and this prompts Reigns to come out; now the cousins engage in a beatdown on Owens. They gather every table, every ladder, and every chair they can find and completely bury Owens in the rubble, but his motto ""Fight Owens Fight"" rings true as he gets out of the rubble and lays it out on Roman and Jey! hitting them both with a steel chair and sending Jey THROUGH A TABLE! Kevin Owens stands tall as we head into a TLC

**WWE TLC**

*Tables, Ladders, and Chairs Match: Roman Reigns (c) vs Kevin Owens*

This match is an utter war. Before the bell even rings, Owens attacks Reigns! 

The bell has rung and Owen is in his element as he throws Roman all over the Thunderdome! Jey even tries to intervene due to the No DQ aspect of the match but gets a steel chair to the back for his troubles. Kevin is a madman throughout this match, even sending Jey Uso THROUGH THE COMMENTARY TABLE! Roman recovers quickly and matches the intensity. For 20+ minutes, Owens and Reigns completely batter each other and send each other through the ringer in this match. I'm talking about being sent through tables. Roman sends Owens back first into standing chairs that leave people wincing. The two engage in a war of the ladders as both Owens and Reigns nail each other face first with the ladders! T

Throughout this match, as Kevin is close to getting the belt, we see Jey Uso constantly interfere. Kevin fights a 2-on-1 battle as he fends off the cousins. In the final stages of the match, Kevin has had enough and  as both he and Jey are fighting, Kevin headbutts Jey multiple times, which leaves Jey reeling and Kevin sends him THROUGH A STACK OF TABLES! Kevin Owens is right there; the title is at his fingertips but Roman quickly climbs the ladder and LOCKS IN THE GUILLOTINE! Owens was already loopy from those headbutts but Roman makes sure he is completely out. 

And completely out he is as the life seems to be leaving the eyes of Owens Roman lets go of the choke and stares at Owens: ""*Better luck next time,""* as he throws out Owens and grabs his title. 

*Roman Reigns def. Kevin Owens*

Complete chaos surrounds the champion as he stares at his cousin and shows his gratitude: ""*Thank you.""* Jey for the first time, smiles. ",2,1751239212.0,MWE,0,1.0,False
1lnsm3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1lnsm3y/learning_to_pray_again_one_tiny_hand_at_a_time/,"Learning to pray again, one tiny hand at a time","I (29f) never imagined motherhood would change how I talk to God.

Before my daughter, I had solid faith. Church every Sunday. Morning devotions with coffee. A prayer journal full of highlighted verses. I thought I had my relationship with Jesus figured out.

Then she came, and none of those old rhythms worked. No quiet mornings. No uninterrupted prayer time. No energy left for journaling.

I felt guilty. Like I was failing God and failing as a mom. I tried to force my old prayer habits, but it didn’t work.

I felt dry.  
I felt angry that motherhood made me feel distant from God.  
I felt like I was drowning in diapers and sleepless nights.  
I felt forgotten when I needed Him most.

I stopped my devotions.  
I stopped opening my Bible.  
I stopped feeling anything when I prayed.  
I stopped believing He was listening. Or maybe I just couldn’t hear Him through the exhaustion.

Then something shifted.

I started watching [Daily Mass](https://www.youtube.com/@DailyTVMass) on YouTube while holding her in the mornings. No makeup. No effort. Just me, her, and cold coffee. It helped. Made me feel less dead inside.

Then someone told me about the [hisword.faith](http://hisword.faith) app. One verse a day felt doable when whole chapters felt impossible. That verse always landed where my heart was breaking. Like God was reaching me through the screen.

I realized God wasn’t asking me to pray the same way anymore.

I found Him in 3am feedings. Whispering “thank you” over her tiny fingers. Praying protection while she slept on my chest. Asking for patience when she wouldn’t stop crying.

Prayer doesn’t have to be perfect. Sometimes it’s just “help me, Lord” whispered at 2am. Sometimes it’s singing “Jesus loves me” while changing diapers. Sometimes it’s feeling His presence so strong it brings tears while nursing.

I still cry on hard days.  
I still feel overwhelmed.  
I still wonder if I’m doing this right.  
I still feel guilty for not being a perfect Christian mom.  
But I’m trying. Like really trying.

Motherhood taught me prayer can be as simple as breathing. Each diaper change a thank you. Each sleepless night a quiet moment with Him. Each milestone a reason to worship.

If you’re a new mom struggling to find God, you’re not alone. He’s right there—in every feeding, every sleepless night, every moment with your baby. You don’t need perfect prayers. He hears your heart, even if all you can say is “Jesus help me.”

Prayer looks different now. But it’s deeper. More real. More desperate and grateful all at once.

Has motherhood changed your faith? I’d love to hear how God has met you in this season.",6,1751239190.0,TrueChristian,2,1.0,False

1lnshah,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lnshah/my_suitors_girl_bestfriend/,my suitor’s girl bestfriend,"For the record, the one thing I really hate the most is when someone tries to push their boyfriend away from his friends. I seriously don’t like that, so if ever someone gives me advice about this, I want it to come from someone who shares the same belief — someone who values fairness and ethics in friendships. If you’re someone who just dislikes a girl best friend or has personal grudges against girl best friends, feel free to skip this post.

He’s 19, a second-year college student. He met his girl best friend back in senior high school, and they’ve been super close ever since. They have a lot of BFF keychains and bracelets — they even have a permanent bracelet. But it’s not just the two of them; they’re actually a trio with another friend (a bisexual person) who later became my best friend too, and that’s how I met my suitor.

My only issue is, I feel like ever since I entered my suitor’s life, the girl best friend started becoming distant. She even ended their nearly 300-day streak on tiktok, and her reason was “focusing on academics,” which honestly felt like a lame excuse to me — especially since her streak with their other friend is still ongoing. My suitor also mentioned that she doesn’t really talk to him anymore.

I don’t have a problem with their issues as friends — I have no intention of interfering with their friendship problems — but things started getting to me when I finally had the chance to meet her.
She was supposed to meet up with our mutual bi friend (my best friend), and I happened to be with that friend at the time along with one of my classmates. My suitor picked us up, but suddenly, the girl best friend and our mutual friend changed their plans. The bi friend just said, “She’ll catch up later.” I was quite disappointed because, honestly, I really wanted to meet her. She’s the only one among their circle I haven’t met yet, and she’s often mentioned — both by my best friend and by my suitor. I even know a few things about her from their stories, and we share a common interest — fangirling! So I was really hoping to finally meet her. That’s why I felt disappointed, and some ideas started popping into my head.

Then recently, she asked a favor from my suitor — she asked if he could accompany her to a coffee shop while she waited for her older brother, since he had a free period. My suitor agreed and said they “caught up.” And honestly, I’m not sure how I feel about that.

I don’t even know if I’m jealous or if it’s just that the situation didn’t sit right with me — that the two of them were alone at the coffee shop from 10 AM to 1 PM, especially since my suitor had a 1 PM class (though the school was nearby). I really admire the effort on his part, since we’re in a long-distance relationship grahhh 

Then I remembered something else: my suitor posted a story of us on Instagram. A little later, my suitor sent a note saying, “arte,” on ig and when I asked him what that was about, he said it was because the girl best friend note something like, “Trigger warning next time.” He felt like that ig notes was aimed at him because his face looked huge in the photo. But like… hello?? I was in that photo too?? Why only react to that one photo? My suitor has posted other stories with different friends before, and she never commented.

I really tried giving her the benefit of the doubt — maybe she just doesn’t know how to act now that her friend is dating someone. Maybe she’s still adjusting. But I don’t know anymore. She’s starting to rub me the wrong way, and I really don’t want that to happen, especially because she’s one of my suitor’s closest friends.

1lnsg01,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsentLoveLetters1st/comments/1lnsg01/i_am_searching_for_my_good_girl/,I Am Searching for My Good Girl,"

In a world filled with fleeting moments and superficial connections, I find myself on a quest—a quest for my good girl. She is not just a name or a face; she is the embodiment of warmth, kindness, and love. I want to share my thoughts on this journey, and perhaps inspire every girl reading this to see herself as that extraordinary person.

### The Essence of a Good Girl

What does it mean to be a ""good girl""? It goes beyond societal definitions. A good girl is someone who carries a light within her, illuminating the lives of those around her. She possesses a heart that is generous, nurturing, and full of compassion. It’s the little things she does that create ripples of joy—a smile that brightens a gloomy day, a kind word that uplifts a weary spirit, or a simple act of love that reminds someone they are cherished.

### The Power of Authenticity

In my search, I yearn for authenticity. I admire the girl who is unafraid to be herself, who embraces her quirks and imperfections. She understands that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. She stands tall in her truth, confident in who she is and what she brings to the table. This authenticity draws me in like a moth to a flame, igniting a deep connection that transcends the ordinary.

### The Beauty of Connection

Every moment spent with a good girl feels like magic. It’s in the laughter shared over coffee, the deep conversations under starlit skies, and the comfortable silence that speaks volumes. She sees the world through a lens of wonder, and her enthusiasm is contagious. Together, we’ll create memories that linger long after the moment has passed, each one a testament to the bond we share.

### A Partner in Adventure

Life is an adventure, and I seek a companion who is ready to explore it with me. A good girl is someone who embraces spontaneity, who is eager to try new things, and who finds joy in the journey rather than just the destination. Whether it’s hiking through breathtaking landscapes or enjoying a cozy night in, every experience is richer when shared with the right person.

### Unconditional Support and Belief

A good girl is my biggest cheerleader. She believes in me even when I falter, and her unwavering support inspires me to reach for the stars. In her eyes, I see potential and possibility, and it fuels a desire within me to be the best version of myself. This mutual encouragement strengthens our bond, creating a partnership built on trust and love.

### The Gift of Love

At the heart of this search is love—the most beautiful gift of all. I seek a good girl who is ready to embrace love in all its forms. Someone who knows that love is not just a feeling, but a choice we make every day. It’s about being there for each other, celebrating victories, and navigating challenges hand in hand. Together, we’ll create a love story that is uniquely ours.

### To Every Girl Reading This

If you resonate with these words, I want you to know that you are special. You have the power to be that good girl—the one who brings joy, authenticity, and love into the world. Embrace your uniqueness, and never underestimate the impact you can have on someone’s life. 

As I continue my search, I hold hope in my heart that our paths will cross. I am searching for my good girl, and perhaps, just perhaps, it could be you. Let’s create a beautiful journey together, filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.

We are looking to buy in about a year but cannot land on WHERE. We are considering Daphne, Fairhope, Spanish Fort, and then also just staying in Mobile. Here are some of our general thoughts and concerns regarding each area. 


We are feeling worried about the safety aspect of Mobile but also are really social and enjoy going downtown plus our church is here. We spend a lot of time at local coffee shops and going on walks around historic midtown so that would be a bummer to leave. But we also are unsure how long we will be in the house and are looking to start a family in close to 5 years— meaning the school district will play a part at that point but doesn’t necessarily right now. 


I love Fairhope/Daphne/Spanish Fort and feel generally safer over there since it’s less city-ish, but worry we will miss out on all things social (we are in our early 20s). A lot of our friends live across the bay but we’d be moving from our church and small businesses here in Mobile that we love. The school district is a lot better of course. Daphne is closest to where we both work however it’s apparently the worst of the 3 across the bay school system wise (????) so then it’s like well what’s the point!? And I felt as if Spanish Fort was relatively sleepy when we drove through but not sure if I just didn’t get a good feel. 

 I’d REALLY appreciate any comments or advice on this and all your thoughts regarding what might be best for us based on what you’ve read above. We’ve only lived here for a year so we are learning all the things before planting roots and really trying to weigh our options. Thank you all in advance! ❤️",2,1751238589.0,MobileAL,9,0.63,False

Hey Reddit,

Anyone else feel like their apartment is shrinking by the day? 😅 I swear, I lose things in my 500 sq ft place all the time. Finding furniture that doesn't make my living room look like a storage unit has been a mission. I needed a coffee table, but also a better spot to work from home than my bed. Then I found the modern lift top coffee table, and I think I might have actually won at adulting for once.

I'd seen these lift top tables before, but a lot of them look like they belong in a college dorm room. I wanted something that looked, you know, *intentional*. I stumbled upon this one online, and it looked sleek, had decent storage, and the lift-top mechanism looked sturdy. I was still skeptical, but the reviews were good, so I took the plunge.

First off, assembly. I'm not exactly a DIY guru, but I managed to put this thing together in about an hour. The instructions were actually clear, and all the parts were labeled. No major cursing fits, which is always a plus.

Now, for the real test: the lift-top. Seriously, it's smooth. Like, butter-smooth. No wobbly, creaky nonsense. It lifts up easily and locks into place, creating a perfect little desk surface. I can comfortably work on my laptop, eat dinner (don't judge, my dining table is also my ironing board), or even do a puzzle without hunching over like a goblin. My back and neck are thanking me. I feel more comfortable and productive.

But the storage! 🤩 That's the other huge win. Underneath the lift-top, there's a surprisingly spacious compartment. I'm talking blankets, books, remotes, even my emergency stash of chocolate all tucked away neatly. It's amazing how much clutter this thing has swallowed up. My living room actually feels…organized now. I never thought I'd see the day. It reduces the need for additional storage solutions. Easier to organize and access items.

I was browsing ursupermart.com and saw a few different options, but this one really stood out.

And the style? It actually looks good! It's got a clean, modern design that fits in perfectly with my existing decor. It doesn't scream ""cheap apartment furniture."" It actually looks like I put some thought into it. Which, you know, I did. 😉 It improves aesthetics of the living space.

Okay, so what are the downsides? Well, it's not the cheapest coffee table out there. But honestly, when you consider that it's basically a coffee table, a desk, and a storage unit all in one, the price feels pretty reasonable. Think of it as an investment in your back, your sanity, and your apartment's overall vibe. It eliminates the cost of buying separate furniture pieces.

Also, if you're planning on hosting Thanksgiving dinner for 20, this isn't it. It's perfect for one or two people, but you're not going to be serving a feast on it.

But overall, I'm seriously impressed. This modern apartment furniture has transformed my small apartment into a much more functional and stylish living space. I feel less cramped, more organized, and actually enjoy spending time in my living room now. It's like a little Swiss Army knife for my apartment. It maximizes space in small apartments.

If you're struggling with limited space and need a multi-functional furniture piece, I highly recommend checking out a lift top table. It’s been a real game changer for my small apartment.

I've been able to reduce the need for additional storage solutions. Easier to organize and access items. I feel more organized and in control. Reduces the need to buy additional furniture/storage. Extends lifespan of stored items.

Okay, so I've been lurking on r/ApartmentLiving and r/SmallSpaces for ages, trying to figure out how to make my tiny apartment feel less like a storage unit and more like...well, a living space. Anyone else feel me? 🙋‍♀️

The biggest problem? My ""living room"" (quotes because it's basically the size of a walk-in closet) was always cluttered. I work from home a few days a week, so I needed a desk, but didn't have the space for a full-on setup. And don't even get me started on the coffee table situation - it was basically a landing zone for remotes, books, and half-eaten snacks. 🤦‍♀️

I’d been eyeing those lift top coffee tables for ages, thinking they were a bit gimmicky and probably overpriced. But after tripping over a pile of magazines *one too many times*, I decided to take the plunge. I started searching for the best lift top coffee table for small apartment living room. I spent weeks researching, reading reviews, and comparing prices.

Let me tell you, finding a decent **modern lift top coffee table** that didn't look like it belonged in a dorm room was a challenge. Most were either super bulky, had zero storage, or were made of that cheap particleboard that crumbles if you look at it wrong.

Then, I stumbled across one I really liked. It had this sleek, modern design that actually matched my existing furniture (score!). But more importantly, it promised to solve ALL my problems: **desk space**, **storage**, and **coffee table**, all rolled into one magical piece of **small space furniture**.

Honestly, the **lift top** mechanism is smoother than I expected. No wobbly hinges or straining to lift it. It just glides up, giving me a perfect little **space saving coffee table with lift top** that's the perfect height for my laptop. I can actually work from my couch now without hunching over like a gargoyle. My back is already thanking me! 🙏

And the **storage capacity**? Seriously impressive. I was able to declutter the entire living room when I received my **modern lift top coffee table for small spaces with easy assembly.** All my blankets, books, and even my yoga mat are now neatly tucked away inside. Game changer.

I even managed to convince my roommate, who was initially skeptical, that it was a worthwhile investment. Now, even they're loving the extra space and the fact that the living room is finally presentable when we have guests over.

This **apartment furniture** is so good I decided to check out their website ursupermart.com and see if they had anything else that was similar.

If you're struggling with a small space and need a multi-functional piece of furniture, I highly recommend checking out a **coffee table with storage**. It's seriously the best thing I've bought for my apartment. If you’re trying to **buy a lift top coffee table**, make sure you do your research like I did and read the customer **review of lift top coffee table with hidden storage**.

1lnsa99,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lnsa99/i_am_searching_for_my_good_girl/,I Am Searching for My Good Girl,"

In a world filled with fleeting moments and superficial connections, I find myself on a quest—a quest for my good girl. She is not just a name or a face; she is the embodiment of warmth, kindness, and love. I want to share my thoughts on this journey, and perhaps inspire every girl reading this to see herself as that extraordinary person.

### The Essence of a Good Girl

What does it mean to be a ""good girl""? It goes beyond societal definitions. A good girl is someone who carries a light within her, illuminating the lives of those around her. She possesses a heart that is generous, nurturing, and full of compassion. It’s the little things she does that create ripples of joy—a smile that brightens a gloomy day, a kind word that uplifts a weary spirit, or a simple act of love that reminds someone they are cherished.

### The Power of Authenticity

In my search, I yearn for authenticity. I admire the girl who is unafraid to be herself, who embraces her quirks and imperfections. She understands that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. She stands tall in her truth, confident in who she is and what she brings to the table. This authenticity draws me in like a moth to a flame, igniting a deep connection that transcends the ordinary.

### The Beauty of Connection

Every moment spent with a good girl feels like magic. It’s in the laughter shared over coffee, the deep conversations under starlit skies, and the comfortable silence that speaks volumes. She sees the world through a lens of wonder, and her enthusiasm is contagious. Together, we’ll create memories that linger long after the moment has passed, each one a testament to the bond we share.

### A Partner in Adventure

Life is an adventure, and I seek a companion who is ready to explore it with me. A good girl is someone who embraces spontaneity, who is eager to try new things, and who finds joy in the journey rather than just the destination. Whether it’s hiking through breathtaking landscapes or enjoying a cozy night in, every experience is richer when shared with the right person.

### Unconditional Support and Belief

A good girl is my biggest cheerleader. She believes in me even when I falter, and her unwavering support inspires me to reach for the stars. In her eyes, I see potential and possibility, and it fuels a desire within me to be the best version of myself. This mutual encouragement strengthens our bond, creating a partnership built on trust and love.

### The Gift of Love

At the heart of this search is love—the most beautiful gift of all. I seek a good girl who is ready to embrace love in all its forms. Someone who knows that love is not just a feeling, but a choice we make every day. It’s about being there for each other, celebrating victories, and navigating challenges hand in hand. Together, we’ll create a love story that is uniquely ours.

### To Every Girl Reading This

If you resonate with these words, I want you to know that you are special. You have the power to be that good girl—the one who brings joy, authenticity, and love into the world. Embrace your uniqueness, and never underestimate the impact you can have on someone’s life. 

As I continue my search, I hold hope in my heart that our paths will cross. I am searching for my good girl, and perhaps, just perhaps, it could be you. Let’s create a beautiful journey together, filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
