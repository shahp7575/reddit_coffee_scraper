1jjvv79,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1jjvv79/is_bloodied_worth_it_in_todays_meta_tested/,Is Bloodied worth it in todays meta? - TESTED,"Is it worth it to go Bloodied? Is the pain of rad management, finding/crafting consumables and dying more often really worth the extra damage? Today I tested it and came here to share it.

# Bloodied and Buffs

**Gear:** I used a full set of Vulcan Overeaters/Luck/Thru-hikers/Rejuvenators power armor and a Furious/Rapid/Vats Optimized/Conductors Gatling Plasma.

**Strategy:** As a bloodied build its very hard to consistently tank the Guardian's damage. For this reason, I didn't use The Dragon to cripple its shield. I had to hide behind a pillar while my gun was spinning up, then I could get closer to it. At this point, Conductors and Rejuvenators could keep me alive. For this part I also used as many buffs as I could possibly get.

**Results:** In theory it would have taken 20 seconds to get EN06 from 100% health to 0% shields excluded. In practice it took me 60 seconds with my strategy since I had to shoot his shield off. Here is the [video ](https://youtu.be/q2LdB2F4BSI)of my best run.

**Breakdown:** 27sec spawn - 17sec shields - 16sec kill

# Full Health and Zero Buffs

**Gear:** I used a full set of Vulcan Overeaters/Agility/Thru-hikers/Limit Breaking power armor and a Furious/Rapid/Vats Optimized/Conductors Gatling Plasma (exact same gun).

**Strategy:** This time around tanking the damage wasn't a concern. I stayed in front of the Guardian the whole time and I could easily use The Dragon to cripple its shield. I didn't use any buffs or consumables, only canned coffee to make sure I could sustain VATS the whole time. In theory I wouldn't need coffee, but private servers have an issue where more AP is needed. 

**Results:** In took 27 seconds to get EN06 from 100% health to 0% shields excluded. It took me 66 seconds total with this strategy. Here is the [video ](https://youtu.be/hwIgGnfvdnA)of my best run.

**Breakdown:** 27sec spawn - 5sec shield - 7sec fumble - 27sec kill

# Conclusion

Going bloodied and using a bunch of buffs resulted in a **DPS increase of approximately 35%**. This is actually quite impressive and not negligible at all. But it made my life hell. I couldn't reliably use the dragon strategy, and a small mistake meant my certain death. On the other hand, playing with my lazy build meant I could easily and reliable kill the Guardian with very little effort. Even though I got 35% more damage, it didn't result in a faster time to kill in practice (if you were to ignore my 7 second fumble). 

So, is bloodied and minmaxing out of your mind worth it? I don't think so. I will continue to play with my [lazy heavy gunner build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout-76/character?v=2&cd=ak0630001000&ef=M5M1McMbM3MfM2M6&l=xx&s=a3a3ba9-f1a3e94&p=sq3s33sr3sx3l71ee1eb1s84ce1cu1s12ck1ip3id3a82ak1af1ai1ad3a33lr1lk3lv3lg1lt3lb2p03ek2e91sz2s01i11l21ej3e71-s43sm3sn3se3sg3pj1l71ee1eb1e91es3eg2eh3ek2ce1cu1i11ck1is3lg1lt3lb2a82ak1af1ai1a13i72im2in2s12a01ac1lu3&swp=ib3al1sg3eh3e81-&ars=1001&ar=0ba0fa09a0ha0ja0da-u70abaafaacax1aadaaea-agaai0ah0ak0aj0x10u70-0ba0900d00f00h00j0&am=1wz-p1ip26p321x51aP-p1ip26p321aP1wr-p1ip26p321x51aP-p1ip26p321aP1wT-p1ip26p321aP1wT-aut-a18a22a3113xaar1qT-a18a3113xa22aav1qh-a18a22a3113xaar1qT-ax61ot-a18a22a3113x1r71qT-a18a22a3113x1r71qT-a16a3813xaaz1rHa2d-a16a3813x1rj1rHa2d-a16a3813xaaz1rHa2d-a16a3813xab31sxa2d-a16a3813x1rj1rHa2d-ax6-aut-1wz-p1ip25p321aF1wd-p1ip25p321aF1wT-p1ip25p321aF1x5-p1ip25p321aF1x5-p1ip25p321aF1wT&lp=xa4x64x44x84xp4x14&wp=2Fa2Fa5Da73a&wm=w17w2404b0Bb0Bd0Bh0B50B7w35-w17w2500P0Bd0Bh0B50B7w3c0Bb-w17w29w3c04b0Uz0Ur0Uj-w17w22w3300R0Yr&n=Raid%20Runner%202.0). I'll use Psychobuff every once in a while and eat whatever comes out my mirelurk steamer. I will obviously play bloodied again whenever I feel like a challenge, but for the most part I'll be playing chill.

The first time I hung out with him and his friend, they cooked me pasta and his friend (let’s call him M) said what do you think of my O? He’s kinda shy and you should ask to hang out sometime. 
I did ask him to come over to my house and we hooked up. 

He asked me out for dinner or coffee sometimes, and I intially rejected him and I made it clear that I was interested in something casual and that I don’t have time to date people. And then he was like I agree, and we went out on dates occasionally and hooked up. Eventually, I noticed that he didn’t really initiate things and made me do all the work in the relationship and I called him out for it, and he was like let’s just talk about it. On one of our dinner dates, we talked about marriage and I said I don’t see myself getting married and he said ‘well what am I doing here then?’ (He apparently says this was a joke? I don’t believe him.) He always stayed over everytime we hooked up and held hands and cuddled. I tried to communicate and when it didn’t seem like he was going to change I blocked him. 

However, I got horny again, and I talked to him (only to hook up tbh). And he was like look, I felt like you were catching feelings (because I asked him if he was interested in continuing to be friends post graduation or if he was interested in a relationship). I only said that because he said that weird shit about marriage. And then he said - he was spending too much time with me and he was deprioritizing his other work for it. That apparently us hooking up everyday, taking naps was ‘too boyfriend energy’ for him. I called him out again and I said - it’s not my problem if you can’t act like an adult. Are you fucking insane? Why would I date you? Why would I push for causal if I wanted to date you? Then he immediately backpedaled and said - I’m sorry I should have communicated better that’s on me. What the fuck is going on?

I have literally nothing happening in my life. I just turned 25, no college degree, barely work part time making coffee in a place I don't want to be in but I literally don't have anything I can see myself doing besides staying at home watching videos on my phone.

Thankfully I have friends that I met throughout the years and I talk to them about it but there's nothing much they can do but sit there and listen and offer their advice that it feels like I heard a million times. I have no money, no savings, single.
Is that all there is to life
Why am I like this
Why can't I change things 
I don't want to end this I really don't but I feel completely hopeless, powerless and helpless and that this world doesn't deserve all the pain I bring to it. I can't have fun anymore with none of my friends except if there's alcohol involved. I feel like a lost cause.

I told my doctor my biggest concern was pain management as I have been using Azo to control flairs and I was worried about long term use and the fact that I can't take it on an empty stomach without being nauseous for the next 24 hours. 

My doctor said the first thing we should try is amitriptyline, starting at 10mg once a day for a week, then 20 for a week, working up to 30 when we will then check in again. I took it last night  and it definitely knocked me out, and today I had trouble getting out of bed until close to 3pm (I'm a teacher on spring break, thank goodness!) It was the kind of drowsiness which I've only ever felt after taking full strength benadryl, like I knew I needed to wake up but my body felt like lead and my mind just kept getting sucked back under into sleep. Now that I am awake and had some coffee I don't feel as groggy anymore, so that's a good sign. 

Anyway, I want to be hopeful about having a potential treatment plan but after a ton of doom googling about side effects and symptoms of amitriptyline, I'm worrying. 

Have any of you dealt with the fatigue and grogginess and had it wear off? Did you find a dosage where it was helping
 your pain? I'm also worried about weight gain, as I'm currently trying to lose weight lol. Did the amitriptyline effect your weight?

1jjvns7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jjvns7/aitah_for_dropping_contact_with_my_ex_and/,AITAH for dropping contact with my ex and excluding her son from game night because of her new man?,"Ok long story here so I'll just dive right in.  This is a long story for context here

7 years ago I met my (now) ex fiance.  We hit it off and quickly developed a relationship.  I have no kids and she has 4.  1 of which does not live with her.  She immediately claimed the kids as my kids, since the dad is a heroin/fent addict and not in the kids lives.  The kids when I met her were 14, 11, 9 and 4.  The 4 year old lived elsewhere with her dad (not the fent addict)

We would do lots of partying on the weekends when I was in town on days off from work (I lived in another town and would travel every weekend then return home for work the following week.

It wasn't the greatest relationship, and I tried to break up with her several times, only to feel bad when the waterworks started (i have a big stupid heart), and would decide to give another chance.  I am very laid back and easily forgiving.  

Roughly 2.5 years into our relationship, in January of 2020, her daughter (my stepdaughter) committed suicide by hanging herself in her bedroom, down in the basement.  I stuck by her side through thick and thin.  She started to drink more, even though I warned her it was a dangerous path to go down and would lead nowhere good.  I warned her multiple times, and I had even pretty much stopped drinking myself (once in a while I would have a couple).

Her drinking started to increase and get worse, and caused multiple relationship problems.  But what is the timeline on breaking up with someone after their daughter commits suicide?  I was torn.  This relationship was quickly spiraling downward.  

We would constantly fight, and she worked a job at a liquor store (ironic).  I would pay for pretty much everything.  I paid half the rent, the other half was paid by the government for some sort of income assistance for her.  I paid the hydro, gas, internet, cell phone, everything.  I would regularly spend 600 to 700 dollars on groceries every couple of weeks when I got paid.  Her money would go to buying alcohol every day, and even then I usually ended up paying for it.  I know that I was an enabler and basically promoting her addiction, but I felt lost and exasperated.  No matter how many y times I tried to sit her down and talk about our problems, it always ended in a fight, because it ""wasn't the right time"" or she ""wasn't in the mood to talk""

She went out drinking with her friends (usually guys) almost every night, using me as a chauffeur for her, while I would normally sit at home and hang out with the kids, usually playing video games or something.

She was always on my case about cleaning up after myself, even though nobody else really did.  She rarely cleaned, and most of the time I would come home from work and be told to make myself a couple hot dogs or that there were a couple mcdoubles for me in the fridge.  Rarely did I come home to a home cooked meal.  Keep in mind that I usually work 12 to 14 hours a day, 5 days a week as a truck driver.

I bought her everything she wanted.  Perfume, jewelry, clothes, I paid for her nails, hair, eyebrows, everything she wanted.  Meanwhile she was drinking every day.  Usually a case of coolers plus a mickey or more of vodka.

She would be mean when she was drunk, always accusing me of cheating on her, or calling me down with degrading names.  I was called a dusgusting pig, a goof, a loser, more than I care to count.  But I have broad shoulders so I just took it and chalked it up to her being drunk.  She would be better when she was sober, right?

She would regularly bring up how we didn't really have sex anymore, and I would tell her that I don't want to have sex with her when she's wasted out of her mind.  I'm not into it.  

She also didn't do anything for herself.  I would regularly ask her to get her license, only to be met with hostility.  She would push all her errands to the weekend, then get angry at 2pm on Saturday because she had all this frantic running around to do because she would wake up at noon every day.  She refused to get her license, and would constantly guilt trip me and gaslight me about it, saying this is what couples do.  We never did anything that I wanted to do.

At home, she would sit on the couch, drink, watch TV and treat me like dirt.  I was her slave.  If I didn't obey her, I was a piece of shit, a loser, and an asshole.  For example, she would get up to put her can away, then come back and tell me to get her another drink.  All the while I was expected to lavish attention on her, and I was also expected to drink with her.  Refusing to do so would start a fight.  I would just cave, because I don't want to fight about stupid, petty things.

I also convinced her to quit the liquor store and take a higher paying job helping homeless people find housing.  She loved it.

So after a few years of that, I decided that maybe things would get better if I proposed.  Maybe that would be the kick in the ass she needed to maybe start treating me better and maybe we could finally start to grow as a couple.  

Things only got worse.  Her drinking got so out of hand that she was getting withdrawals in the mornings, and had been reprimand at her work several times for being intoxicated.  I tried to get her to go to AA, and she got her guy friend to take her.  Then one time she came back from AA drunk and I knew then that nothing would ever get better.  So I gathered up my courage one day this past summer (2024) and I ended it.  I left her.

I left almost everything of mine.  My bed, my mini fridge, ps5 that she got me for our anniversary.  I left the engagement ring that I bought her.  I took some of my clothes, and I slept in my pickup for several nights until my brother found out and insisted I stay with him and his wife.

In those first few months after I left, I didn't say much about her to anyone regarding why I left, just that there were issues we couldn't resolve.  

However, she proceeded to absolutely drag my name through the mud.  She told everyone I had been cheating on her, and I even had to block her mom on Facebook because she was starting to harass me.

My ex apparently got jumped, and proceeded imply online that I was the one who set it up.  I'm not a gangster, I don't play those stupid games.  I continued to refrain from putting her on blast, though several times before she unfriended me i went on to a post she made about me and set the record straight, not that it did much anyways.

I told her I wanted to come by to pick up some of my stuff, and she refused to let me in.  I ended up calling the police and they came in with me to get certain things she allowed me to get.  She told them I got a bag of clothes and when I got home I opened it and it was just a bag of garbage.  I continued to take it in stride, still paying her cell phone like an idiot, and I didn't break contact, because her son (autistic) plays d&d with me and a group we have that play every weekend.  

Since then I've been harassed, threatened, and dragged.  The ones who know me know that it's all lies about me.  I'm a solid dude and try to be a good person.  I have a big heart and I wear it on my sleeve.  

These past couple of months, she has started dating this guy.  It doesn't bother me that she's dating as I've moved on.  However, she has started to call and text me a lot more, stating that he beats her up and is extremely jealous of me.  My name gets brought up a lot apparently.  She keeps asking me to go for coffee, and to go for a walk sometime.  I brush it off because I don't want to, as I don't want to be with her anymore.

A couple weeks ago she called me to tell me that she's 3 months pregnant and doesn't want to have this man's kid.  It felt like a huge slap in the face because I want to have kids, and she knows this.  She strung me along for the first year of our relationship by saying we were trying to have a kid, only to reveal a little over a year in that she was essentially fixed and couldn't really have kids anymore.  I had gotten her pregnant a couple times, allegedly, but she always miscarried, so she said.  So her being pregnant was a punch in the gut.

Anyways, so I got a call last night from her, and it sounded like she was crying.  She fed me some story about how her phone got smashed up, and wanted to know how she would go about getting a new one, being on my account.  Several times I heard ""oh shit"" and she would hang up, only to call me back a little while later.  I'm keeping her at arms length and not talking to her in a way that could be construed as me flirting or anything.  I know I shouldn't have answered but I have a big heart, like I said.

So anyways, this morning at 630am I was sent a picture from her phone of her boyfriends genitals.  No text or anything with it.  I didn't respond, and don't want to.  I want to block her but her son is part of our dnd group.

So now I have to ask...would I be the asshole for completely dropping her from my life and excluding her son from our dnd group as a result?  How should I handle this without getting to heavy into an altercation?  Need help here.  Sorry for the long post.

I was riding my e-scooter on my way to the gym for cardio, and as I approached a turn near Al Twar 1, 48 Street, I saw three cars to my right while I was going straight, with another car behind me. I was riding at a slow pace, around 25 km/h, as I always make sure to follow traffic rules. I'm not one of those reckless riders.

There was a Tesla turning left in front of me, and I was continuing straight. I stopped as usual, and so did the Tesla. After a couple of seconds, I started moving again, thinking the driver had stopped for me. However, the driver suddenly started the car, and I had to swerve to avoid a crash. The driver then honked continuously for about 4-5 seconds. I felt really embarrassed, thinking I had done something wrong. This has never happened to me before.

I'm not sure which community is best to post this in, or if the driver is on Reddit, but I just want to say that if you're reading this, I'm sorry 🙏. I didn’t mean to cause any trouble,  I just thought you stopped for me. Please don't assume that all e-scooter riders are reckless. Have a great day!

The first few years were okay, until he started binge drinking and driving. He destroyed two cars but took no responsibility for anything. Even asked me to commit insurance fraud for destroying someone’s mailbox and wanting me to claim I was the person and he’d rectified it and fixed it- he never actually contacted the person who’s mailbox he obliterated. 

He started fighting with me or my husband anytime he asked a question or for advice and we didn’t agree with him (cheating on his GF because he found a cuter younger girl or sabotaging a friend at work because he made fun of my brother) we would tell him our honest opinion and he’d go 0-100 and start screaming at us. We’d ask him to stop yelling and his response would be “this isn’t yelling- THIS IS YELLING!!!” SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. We had neighbors literally 100 feet from our house with young children. 

Even over small things like asking to do dishes or cleaning he’d say he didn’t need to because he didn’t do it. One time he smashed and smeared a dead spider all over the kitchen wall and said he didn’t have to clean the wall because he’d killed the spider. 

I could go into so much more about petty things that had happened, but at this point 4 years in my husband and I had decided to just keep walking on egg shells, my husband just fed up- I’d asked him over and over to please just keep putting up with it cause he was my brother so he did.
 Until my brother decided kicking me down the stairs and kicking me as hard as he could in my stomach was okay. (Two separate times over several weeks) brother had claimed he was afraid of me walking towards him while we were arguing “because of the look in my eyes”.

I’ve haven’t hit my brother since I was 14 and he’d been choking me and threw me into a glass coffee table- but everyone just said “He has anger issues you should’ve just left the house.” At the time we were in a low income place in OK and I couldn’t even leave the house without someone trying to hit on me or offer me drugs. So I just begrudgingly had to be more careful around him. He has always been violent. 

Fast forward to 2024 we’ve all moved out and away from my brother, and he’s at my work place, asking if there was anything he could do in my opinion to apologize to his friend. I asked if he’d actually really apologized because he’s the type of person to say “I’m sorry you feel like you need an apology” or “I’m sorry you think I upset you” 
(background: his friend was mad because my brother had torn his ACL snowboarding and had blamed his friend for inviting him- it was “his fault” and my brother wouldn’t believe otherwise, if he’d never asked him to go he wouldn’t have hurt himself. ) he decided to tell his friend this and blame him to his face and his friend had obviously gotten upset. 

so I literally said:
Me: did you really apologize?
Him:Yes!
Me: but like really in the way he needed it not just “sorry”?
Him:YES!!
Me: I don’t believe you. 

He went once again 0-100 -“You’re saying I’m a liar! Read the room! You’re supposed to be my sister- IM SUICIDAL!!”

I told him I’m okay with talking to him but he needs to leave my workplace and we can’t be arguing here. 
He literally screams “IM NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!!” And storms out, afterwords texting me I’m a Re??rd multiple times and misspelling the word and trying to correct himself- telling me he was ready to end it and I should be more sympathetic to him. I reached out and he admitted he wouldn’t ever harm himself- So I told him I’m blocking him for a while because I’m not dealing with this type of abuse just because he can’t take criticism. 

I blocked him for three days and texted him asking if he wants to talk. I haven’t heard from him since despite texting multiple times asking if he’s okay, he got a DUI and I asked if he needed help or a driver to medical appointments for his ACL surgery - nothing back. 

So I guess my question now is- am I overreacting by now wanting to completely cut him out of my life? Delete his number and never try to contact him again? 
I just feel bad because both our parents have passed and as far as I know he has no one. Through the grapevine I know he’s okay and not in jail- but I was really hoping he’d see how much I just wanted to help him, he’s done so much worse to me and acted like nothing happened.  

AIO? My husband says no, but it’s always just been me and my brother growing up in foster care and I feel like I’m abandoning him.

So the new doctor discontinued my Wellbutrin and I am now just on my Effexor.

It was a nice day, so I forced myself out of the house to grab some coffee and work on my resume to send it out. An hour in, my partner calls me to briefly apologize for being so distant lately and that they haven't been feeling like themselves. I honestly could tell, they had just come back from a trip as recently as Thursday, March 20th and even expressed this exhaustion when they came to my house to rest before heading back home (we were a semi-LDR couple). They have been struggling to find steady work for the better part of the year and had to move back to their hometown for the foreseeable future. It was painful but we assured one another that our relationship was stronger than the distance we were experiencing. 

Anyway, I forgave them because I assumed they were feeling bad about it and it wasn't a big deal to me. Later on, we were messaging about random stuff and I sent a short message about how inspiring they are to me, how everything's gonna be okay, and that I wish could take all their bad feelings from them. They responded by stating they were feeling intense negativity to being completely numb which in turn led them to saying they needed space to settle down. When I asked for clarification and if it meant space from me, they said ""Yes, I'm so sorry"". 

I thought it was strange so I asked them again to clarify; they responded with ""I don't think I mean it"" to which I blatantly asked, ""Are you breaking up with me?"" and they said, ""No I'm not breaking up with you, or asking for a break, I just need a couple days."" I immediately start freaking out and going into panic mode because to me that sounded like on the verge of a breakup. I said ""Okay I understand"" and was about to leave it at that but again, began freaking out because, for the first time in our 4.5 years together, I didn't know where we stood in terms of our relationship. So I said, ""It legitimately sounds like you’re breaking up with me so I need you to decide if that's what's happening right, I know you’re going through a lot and I understand that, but now I feel sick because just 10 minutes ago, I thought we were okay and I know it seems like it has nothing to do with me but when you say you need to be alone, you’re confused, and that you need space from me, it seems like you just do not want to be with me right now."" 

They said ""You're a loving, supportive and uplifting partner that I feel so lucky to be around, but right now I'm just not feeling attraction and I don't know why. I'm sorry, you don't deserve to have to deal with this wish-washiness. I'm just so confused, I'm sorry. I don't think I'm in the right headspace to have this conversation things are really weird this week right now and I feel like it would be fairer for both of us to talk this through in a couple of days."" I was in shock. Now in tears, I ran to call my two best friends, and went over to one of their houses, balling my eyes out because I couldn't understand how fast it happened, how quickly they took back their words once I mentioned breaking up, but why mention the space if you don't mean it but you also aren't attracted to me all of a sudden? 

Fast forward to me at my friend's house, I asked my ex (this is all still happening through text btw) how long was a couple of days? and they said, ""Can we talk on Tuesday?"". I decided at that moment that was completely unacceptable; I was in shambles, I had work the next day, and I was just supposed to sit here and wonder if my partner still loved me in the dark for 48 hours. Fuck that, so I called them.

It was a 2-hour-long conversation, I asked when they started to feel not attracted to me anymore and they said since they came back from their trip, so just 3 days ago. I asked if they felt this way when they were on their trip, and they said no. I asked if they felt this way on my birthday, which was quite literally two weeks before this and we had spent the whole day together, and they said no. So I cried to them asking them when they started to feel this way, and they sobbed back that they didn't know and that they were feeling confused. 

I asked ""Do you love me?"" and they couldn't answer me. 

I was heartbroken 

We had just messaged each other I love you just 2 hours before this occurred and here I was, on the phone with the supposed love of my life and they couldn't tell me they loved me. 

They kept saying ""I don't know"" which to me, sounds like no. 

I was, and still am, so upset that this is how I'm finding out. Instead of bringing it up to me as soon as they felt this way, they were going to push this feeling down. The moment I asked if they were breaking up with me, still they were going to just lie and lead me to believe that everything was okay.  

They went on and on about how I was their best friend, their confidant, their person but any time I asked them if they loved me, they couldn't give me an answer. 

So after hours of back and forth, I said ""Are we breaking up? This decision is on you because you don't love me right? You can't tell me yes so that must be no."", it was small but they had said ""I think it's best if we break up."" The hours of begging them to give me real answers had come to an end. I ended our conversation;

""I'm only interested in the conversation of getting back together, you have my number, if that's not the conversation you want to have then I suggest you don't call me, Goodnight, I love you."" 

I don't know why I said that because before reading all these stories of blindsiding and avoidants deciding to be premeditative about these breakups. It sounds like I had jumped the gun and asked them to act on a feeling that could've gone away.

So I ask this, should I have waited? Should I have given them their space? Was it wrong to call them when they asked for that space? Did I act too aggressively and force them to confront the negative emotions about our relationship they could've otherwise let pass? 

I haven't spoken to them in 2 days which is the longest we've gone without talking in almost 5 years. I've been crying nonstop, cursing their name, blaming myself, and grappling with the reality that we're no longer together and more so... That they don't love me anymore. 

Please help me, I feel sick, infected even. I can't stop crying and wanting to text them and apologize and also curse them out for doing this to us. I just want them back but I'm also so sickened by how they approached this. 

Someone tell me it's not a good idea to text them, to call them. 

I have a support system that otherwise helps with this but I just need some guidance, some comfort, some clarity, and some perspective because my brain feels like mush.

Thank you <3

My roommate (22F) and I (23F) are very close, and I truly value our friendship. However, we have different lifestyles. She works from home, while my job requires me to be on my feet and interacting with people for long shifts—sometimes over 12 hours. She spends the majority of her time at home, sometimes going multiple days without leaving, whereas I’m rarely home due to work, the gym, or social outings.

Lately, I’ve found myself feeling a bit frustrated by how often she occupies the common areas. I completely understand that we both pay equal rent and have the right to use these spaces as we choose, but it can be difficult to come home after a long day and find that the TV is already on and she’s in the same spot as when I left. On my days off, she’s often in the living room working (taking calls and what not) or doing schoolwork (zoom classes for grad school), which makes me feel like I need to be extra quiet while cooking or watching TV. Additionally, it’s become the new home for small personal items on the side and coffee tables—things like drink cups, prescriptions, chapstick, jewelry, and even a half-smoked blunt which was left there for a week before I asked her to not leave out in the open in common areas since we are renting—which makes the space feel more like hers than ours.

I feel guilty even feeling this way because she isn’t necessarily doing anything wrong, and I don’t think it would be fair to ask her to spend more time in her room. However, I want to understand whether my feelings are valid and if this is something worth addressing in a conversation. Am I being unreasonable, and have I just reached a point in my life and career where maybe it would be better for me to live alone?

## Why choose a Plastic-Free Electric Kettle?

Beyond health, there's the environmental impact. Plastic pollution is a major global issue, and reducing your plastic consumption is a tangible way to make a difference. An eco kind kettle made from stainless steel or borosilicate glass is a more enduring choice than a traditional plastic kettle. By choosing a no plastic kettle, you contribute to a smaller, eco friendly footprint.

## What to Look For in a Plastic-Free Electric Kettle

Here are the key factors to consider when shopping for the best plastic free electric kettle:

*   **Materials:** The safest materials for a plastic free hot water kettle are food grade stainless steel and borosilicate glass. Ensure that all parts of the kettle that come into contact with water, including the inner lid and any filters, are made from these materials. Avoid kettles with plastic components, even if they are labeled ""BPA-free,"" as other potentially harmful chemicals may still be present. A stainless steel kettle is always a great and long lasting option that will resist corrosion for years to come.

*   **Construction:** Look for a double wall kettle. This provides better insulation, keeping water hotter for longer and making the kettle safer to touch. Check the build quality; a well-constructed kettle will last longer and perform better.

*   **Features:** Consider features like temperature control, a keep warm function, and automatic shut off. A temperature control kettle is essential for tea and coffee enthusiasts who want to brew at the optimal temperature. The keep warm function is handy for keeping water hot for multiple cups. Automatic shut off is a crucial safety feature. A variable temperature kettle is essential for tea so you can make the subtle variations of green, oolong, white, or black teas.*   **Functionality:** Choose a kettle that suits your needs. A fast boil kettle is convenient for busy mornings. A cordless kettle makes pouring easier. If you're a pour over coffee aficionado, consider an electric gooseneck kettle for precise pouring. Some kettles have a quiet kettle feature, so there's no loud sounds during the morning hours.

*   **Certifications:** Look for certifications like EU certified plastic free kettle and LFGB certified plastic free kettle to ensure the kettle meets safety standards. These certifications verify that the materials used are food-safe.

*   **Water Level Indicator:** Knowing the quantity of water makes it easy to boil the right amount, thereby saving electricity. Look for a water level indicator kettle made of glass or stainless steel for easy viewing.

* **September 2024:** Underwent an endoscopy with my GI doctor, which showed no abnormalities (no redness, no growths). I was diagnosed with **functional dyspepsia** and prescribed Nortriptyline. I was supposed to increase to 50 mg, but due to my consistently high resting heart rate (over 100 BPM), we stopped at 30 mg, then reduced to 20 mg. While my stomach symptoms slightly improved, the side effects outweighed the benefits.
* **February 2025:** Another severe episode occurred when I was leaving my house—I felt shaky and off, then became dizzy while walking to the gym. I checked my heart rate, which was at **198 BPM** and not coming down. I asked my wife to call an ambulance. At the ER, tests (EKG, bloodwork, X-rays) all came back normal. I was given heart rate medication, which helped, but anxiety medication had no effect. The doctors recommended stopping Nortriptyline, which I tapered off under my GI’s guidance. I started taking **Bisoprolol (2.5 mg once daily, a beta blocker)** to help control my heart rate. Since then, my heart rate has been more stable. I had passed my licensing exam in January 2025, so I was surprised that this episode still happened.
* **February 2025 (Cardiology):** Wore a Holter monitor for two weeks, which showed **sinus tachycardia but no arrhythmias**. My cardiologist ruled out SVT, checked my blood levels, and performed a **stress test**, which I was able to complete. My **echocardiogram is scheduled for April 2025**, and I also have an upcoming **psychiatrist appointment**.

# General Thoughts:

I’ve been seeing a therapist since **July/August 2024** and have made progress with my mental health. However, my **physical symptoms—especially my heart rate spikes—continue to be confusing and disruptive**. I’m planning to see a psychiatrist to determine whether anxiety or stress could be contributing to these episodes. However, I **don’t always feel anxious before they happen**, which makes it even more frustrating.

I am only on one dose in the morning. I took my meds with breakfast, drank half my coffee, and I had a lot of water. Within minutes I felt like I had just gotten off a ride at the fair and it kept getting worse and started to toss my stomach. 

I decided to sleep it off in hopes that maybe my brain just wasn’t used to it and it had to right itself. I slept for 2.5 hours, woke up covered in sweat and shaky. However, once fully awake I felt great! I ate a banana thinking I was shaky from low sugar or something.

I left to get my 4 year old from daycare and on the way there I started to get hot, like I had a fever. I opened up the windows and turned the AC on. Stopped feeling hot but my stomach started to turn and cramp some. After I picked up kiddo, I was driving home and unfortunately on these back roads there is NO WHERE to pull over and traffic is too much that I couldn’t stop and I threw up on myself, on my passenger seat and the passenger door. Let’s all thank God above that my sweet boy was sleeping in his car seat hard enough to not hear or see me expel a freaking demon out of me!!! 

I was shaking, crying, coughing for a min or two until I found a spot to pull over. Threw up some more and peed myself. But immediately felt better. 

We came home and I made chicken broth and ate that with some strawberries on the side. Stomach is turning but it feels like it is about to run through me this time, instead of escaping out of my mouth.

1jjvb9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1jjvb9k/coreweave_s1_analysis/,CoreWeave S-1 Analysis,"CoreWeave [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/coreweave-aims-to-raise-up-to-2point7-billion-in-ipo.html) their intent to sell 49-million shares at $47-$55 per share, hoping to generate $2.7-billion through their IPO. A few things stood out to me as interesting snippets from their [amended S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525058309/d899798ds1a.htm) that was filed with the SEC filing on 3/20. I encourage members to consider reading these required SEC filings, especially Form 10-Ks, because companies themselves are asked to identify headwinds and risk factors they will face. Hearing what a company has to say about itself can be problematic sometimes as they attempt to craft positive narratives, but SEC filings *require* that they provide counter-narratives. Sometimes they are the most informed people about their weaknesses.

Anyway, here is what I noticed after reading what CoreWeave put together:

**Background Information**  
CoreWeave's current business is providing access to the latest GPUs but it started in 2017 as a crypto mining company. As that market faltered, the company shifted to provide compute for hardware-intensive software like 3D modeling or big data analysis. After generative AI took off, they pivoted again to focusing compute for AI and now own 250,000 NVIDIA GPUs that they rent out per-unit-per-hour. The target audience is hyperscalers who don't have enough compute on their own, using CoreWeave's services to supplement and fill their needs. Revenue in 2013 was $229-million and exploded to $1.9-billion in 2024.

**Customer Base**  
The filing indicates that CoreWeave's customers are the biggest tech companies that are working on their AI capabilities - IBM, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, NVIDIA, etc. Microsoft represented 35% of revenue in 2023 and 62% in 2024 (pg. 33 of S-1 filing) while ""Customer C"" accountaed for 17% of revenue in 2023 and 15% in 2024 (pg. F-13 of S-1 filing). A good guess is that ""Customer C"" is NVIDIA renting back the chips that they have sold to CoreWeave. The only way CoreWeave could secure that number of chips is by cozying up to NVIDIA and maintain a good relationship with them; NVIDIA [currently owns](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-backed-coreweave-aims-raise-up-27-billion-us-ipo-2025-03-20/) 5.9% of CoreWeave and that is expected to decline to 5.05% after the IPO.

Microsoft and ""Customer C"" represent 77% of CoreWeave's revenue in 2024. That kind of concentration is worrisome and the company knows this, noting further on page 33 that ""any changes in demand from Microsoft .. would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects"". A few weeks ago, the Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/f3d9d339-42ef-4979-bf52-89ecd699dea2), citing anonymous sources, that Microsoft had indeed ""withdrawn from some of its agreements over delivery issues and missed deadlines"". CoreWeave [denied](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-withdrew-some-coreweave-agreements-over-delivery-issue-ft-reports-2025-03-06/) the FT report but Microsoft has not commented. Maybe this means Microsoft accounts for 60% of revenue moving forward or maybe that number is even lower, but it is important to note nonetheless.

**Financial Reporting**  
The balance sheet shows that the company has $7.9-billion in debt (pg. 91) and operating losses of $863-million (pg. 108). The debt comes at a pretty steep cost, as the company wrote that $941-million was dedicated to debt service requirements in 2024 (pg. 72). Remember, revenue was $1.9-billion in 2024, so almost half of revenue is going into debt servicing; they're going to need proportional growth in revenue to fund these debt obligations or, as the company writes ""we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures"" (pg. 72). For a company that needs to purchase GPUs to provide the compute, dropping capex may hinder growth, so this is a quite a quagmire *if the growth doesn't accelerate.*

I had some questions about what assets the company used to secure their debt and was a little surprised to find that they [collateralized the GPUs](https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/). To some extent, this makes sense given the cost that the company has taken on in getting the GPUs themselves, but unlike real estate, the GPUs are depreciating assets. They eventually become obsolete and wear down with consistent use, so they'll need to be replaced with further capex. On top of that, since their value goes down, I think that will affect the principal loan amount to reflect the depreciation, but I will need to look and think about this some more.

Separately, there is an interesting realization that the company had while preparing the S-1 filing. On page 130, the company shares ""we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" and ""there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."" I am probably a little sensitive to this because I watched $SMCI closely during their accounting challenges and, in fairness, startups often have to implement processes and hire the right people to fix these types of issues, but...

**Governance and Leadership**  
... the founders of the company have cashed out. Michael Intrator (CEO), Brian Venturo (CTO), and Brannin McBee (CSO) were hedge fund guys before they started this tech company and pages 190 and 191 indicate they have sold over $487-million in stock between the three of them during two tender offers. The trio has a disproportionate control of the company, with less than 3% of Class A shares between them yet retaining control over the company through Class B shares that carry 10 votes per share, allowing them to control 80% of the votes (pg. 202).

**So, What's the Play?**  
I have generated enough cautionary thoughts to avoid this IPO as a long-term investment, but it is important to note that these are based on fundamentals and my personal biases. For example, I don't think it is necessarily fair to criticize the founders for cashing out or questioning their governance model since it is the same model Zuckerberg uses at Meta.

The more important thing is that our market has departed from fundamental analysis for some time, instead relying on *animal spirits*, momentum, and euphoria. I wrote all these words that imply negative sentiment but *still think the company's share price can perform well*. The median share price expectation is $51, so I think I know what my play will be, **but this is where I need you all for feedback and thoughts!**

* pour a big cup of coffee, pull up the hourly chart on Day One
* watch the volume intently, as IPO appetite will be strong and we should expect a buying frenzy
* compare the hourly volume through mid-day to see what the momentum says; now we are at a decision tree...
* if volume has slowed down and price has stabilized, I'll sell an OTM put and call it a day; this strategy will allow me to collect premium and potentially grab the stock ""on sale"" later if it falls, keep the premium if it does not, and likely buy to close the options at 30%-35% profit targets in a few weeks
* if volume is stable and the price has found a footing, I'll wait until the second half of the day to see if I can find some value with an ITM call that I will trade out of with a 15-20% profit target, likely the next day; the strategy here is that the price went up on Day One and the news will report it as such after the bell and throughout the evening, which should invite buyers the next day that will give me my exit runway

**Please know that I am very flexible-minded and my opinion can change with further discussion. I hope you disagree with me so we can talk about it and work together to generate a trade we all can benefit from!**",1,1742939129.0,InnerCircleInvesting,0,1.0,False

My 25 year marriage ended March '23 after I found out that my huz was cheating on me for our entire relationship. I, being psychic and also wildly codependent knew on a level but denied my awareness for years. 
Right after our split I threw myself into dating, yes, dumb - maybe.

Only 18 days after we separated I met someone on the same platform that my huz used to cheat on me (a kink site). This man rocked me to my core. But  I was not sober from codependency nor was he sober in his addictions. We, painfully, parted ways fall '23.

Well y'all he just came back this Jan, sober, and I've been in therapy and 12 stepping my codependency. Me, still feeling insecure, (he's so hot! he's 12 years my junior!) have done tarot pulls that ALL indicate he's my person. Consistently get 2 of cups, 6 of cups and 10 of cups. When I asked the question what is our shared destiny, I got High Priestess, the Sun and the Star card. 

Despite all the good cards and good feeling we have in our reconnection I still suffer insecurity. Well, I had a dream that I opened a kitchen cabinet and 2 coffee cups hit me in quick succession right on top of my head! Ha! 

tldr: husband cheated. I met new person to whom I'm insanely attracted and perfectly compatible almost immediately after break, on the site he used to cheat on me with. Had dream that 2 coffee cups hit me on the head after being insecure and questioning if he's the one.

Male friend (23) who I’ll call Joe,and I(22F) have been friends for 2 years now. Joe’s mom, let’s call her Nina, lives in a different state than he did ( for most of his life). Joe lived with his dad.

Joe,his mom and I went travelling to a neighbouring country and I stayed with her, her mom , step dad , sister and Joe for a month on their huge plot (It was an invited stay). We got along so well, all the time. Joe warned me that Nina can get jealous,but no problems arose.

Now … my family is a complicated, chaotic mess. My dad, who I met when i was 19, is an A-Hole ( not going to disclose), and my mom and step dad who I stayed with growing up, are difficult people. My grandparents are awesome ,but they stay in the middle of nowhere with no opportunities.

Last year, Joe and I went travelling for 1 year, i was told by his family privately to keep him safe. I updated them constantly, did make decisions for us because Joe didn’t want to, and managed finances ( also because he didn’t want to). By the end of the trip, we became SUPER CLOSE.We came back and Joe’s mom started acting weird. 

At that time, my mom said I can live with her when i get back but will have to start paying rent immediately- about 35% of my old salary, not including food. My dad said I could not move in with him ( though I didn’t want to)because I betrayed him by going to travel for a year. 

I want to finally follow my dream - after travelling for a year , seeing the world and understanding how content one can be with life, I decided to follow it. But I needed one year. I needed people that would support me (more emotionally) and not doubt that I can do this. That is Joe. He is a great friend. 

Joe was planning to move to his mom’s state to go to Uni there. He asked if I wanted to come with, I could stay there with them as there is more that enough space and I get along with his family really well. Or, his family in the state I was in at the time , personally offered me to stay with them. I declined and decided to go with him to Nina’s state.

When I got there, Nina was off with me but I pegged it on her being excited to see her son. Progressively she started to almost bully me. I don’t want to go into details, but she will flat out ignore me when I ask her questions, she will be rude to me when I try to help her by doing washing or cleaning (Joe does nothing whereas I help whereever I can without being asked),She raises her voice at me etc. I smile and smile and smile. 

None of the other family have this problem with me, I help the granny and sister on the daily and I am really close to them. I clean the house during the day (As i WFH) and the sister who has a terminal illness , i also help tremendously. Her and I have become very close, but she and Nina have a feud. The step dad ( Nina’s step dad/Joe’s grandpa) is mean to everyone. I smile and ensure the granny that this is no problem because she is always worried about me - but it is nothing compared to my family back home lol.

Now , Joe has come to me and said he sees how his mother treats me and he tries to talk to her but she is defensive and rude. She has since mostly ignored my existence but started being rude to him, constantly negative and unsupportive etc. It is weighing on him but it upsets him when I talk to him about the impact I have seen it having on him. He is becoming negative and pessimistic, like her. I understand that it is his mother so I have stopped talking to him about it since then. He believes that she is jealous. I have said I can move, but then he says he wants to go with me -  I decline .

He couldn’t get into uni, couldn’t get a job and spends all the time at Ninas office doing I don’t know what. On weekends , he tells me I must stay at home as they are doing something , this is new but she is upset if all of us spend time together. I have told him I will come with them to the office 2x a week as a compromise to try and spend time with him. He wants me there but she doesn’t, so she gets more upset and normally storms into her room, blaring music when we all return from the office. He then has to do damage control. Hence why I do not want to go.

She stays with him once they get home till about 23h00 ,when everyone goes to sleep. 

She doesn’t even offer me coffee anymore (which she used to , always) though, I relentlessly and sincerely offer her.

WEIRD THING: Joe had to go to his old state for about 2 weeks, and she and I got so close! As soon as he returned, Nina went back to that old self.

I am trying to support him , help him get a job, help him see why he is having night terrors and stomach issues, and headaches , help him with his weight ( at his request) but she seems to be doing everything to oppose that. 

I have given up. My mood does not change, i still greet her with a smile, offer her coffee and meals, do her washing etc. I don’t know what to do.

My question is, knowing she is so defensive, do i talk to her about this or do i stick it out for the remaining 8 months without saying anything? Do i give them more space? ( I don’t know if it is humanly possible) … what do i do?

The first week when i got here and she was already so off and meanish, i was also off and i couldn’t hide it well. But since then, I have apologised and became more happy, self-independent , not affected by moods and rude comments and have a good support system in and out of the house.I don’t know if that time changed her perspective of me, I told her I was just fearful and missing home though it was no excuse for my mopey behaviour.

So please Reddit, what do I do? 

I genuinely care for her, I don’t want her to feel like this in her own home - if it is me, and I want to fix this.

Yesterday was our 3 months and we had plans to go into the city for a nice dinner and to go bowling. Earlier that day she had come over and we watched a movie while cuddling and just chilling and everything seemed to be going great we were laughing and play wrestling all the things that made us happy. Then I dropped her off at her house so she could get ready for tonight while I went to get a haircut. After my haircut was done she text me that she’d like to talk to me about something before we had went on our date. I paid no mind to it as we’re usually pretty open and I assumed it was about the cost of everything as she had mentioned splitting the bill earlier today so I didn’t have to pay for everything. Once I got to her house she came outside and told me “I don’t want to lead you on and I don’t feel a click with you and you deserved a better person” she then walked back inside and sent me a text saying she’s sorry and that was that. It’s been a day now and I got very little sleep last night because all I can do is think about the happy memories I’ve made with her from going to church every Sunday and our little coffee dates. Maybe I’m just overthinking but there was no signs that there was any problems in our relationship and it feels odd to me she didn’t come and talk to me before making this decision she simply said a sentence and left me there.

	•	Stir in vodka.

2. Prepare the Milk Wash
	•	In a separate bowl, pour whole milk and warm slightly to room temp.

	•	Let it sit for at least 30 minutes.

3. Strain & Clarify
	•	Line a sieve with a coffee filter or cheesecloth and slowly pour the mixture through.
	•	Let it filter naturally (don’t force it through).

4. Bottle & Store
	•	Funnel into two 750ml bottles (total yield is ~1700ml).
	•	Store in the fridge; should be shelf-stable for at least a week.

Serving Instructions

1jjv6ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjv6ya/currently_work_in_a_restaurant_advice_on_my/,Currently work in a restaurant. Advice on my thought process.,"Hello, this is my first post and probably my only one for a while. I will try to make it brief, but I have quite a bit of information to include to make the situation easier to understand. 

I work in a restaurant within London as a Barista/Bar Supervisor, and have been for the last year and a half (started Oct 2023). In July 2024, out of interest, I asked if I could become salaried, rather than paid by the hour. Surprisingly, they agreed. Now, I am quite naive as a person, and despite being almost 27, I don't have much experience in the work world in general. The reason this is relevant is because I asked for quite a low salary expectation for what my job usually gets paid. I asked for about 24-25k per year, not doing a background checks on similar salaries elsewhere. The manager, after discussing in the office with the owner, ended up offering me 28k instead. To keep it short, I laughingly asked why, and she said that it was to reward me for what I deserved for the work I've put in. I will leave it there for that part.

Fast forward, but also up until July 2024, where I got my raise, the restaurant has always been difficult to manage and deal with. The boss is extremely frugal, despite the restaurant being quite popular, which frequently causes a lot of issues, when it comes to working material, equipment, help and hours of work etc. Here are some issues:

\- Almost always, the feeling is that we are understaffed. If you are efficient, like any other place, more work will be placed on you, and many will be sent home early. From originally being someone who stays behind the coffee machine, I have eventually learned to do every position for FOH and BOH (except cooking ofc).

\- Almost everyday, I go past my shift end time, to about 30 minutes later, or I frequently do all the closing tasks alone because, for some reason, writing this EOD report takes 1 hour (but I know the managers just chill on Instagram and let me or someone else do all the closing tasks). I had a few days where I was the MOD for that day, and it came down to me to write the EOD report and whatnot. Believe it or not, I wrote it up in 5 minutes way in advance, and waited for past closing time to write it, as to not get told off for 'finishing' the day early. I never got told off that it was rushed, and I made sure it wasn't. As much as I believe managers have other things to do, they constantly lie to me about why they head to the office (usually to 'do the hours'), because they end up doing that exact thing the day after (seemingly like no progress was done the first time they said it).

\- To add to that part above, even if I write on the rota that I finished quite a bit later, my proceeding weeks don't get updated to have less hours to balance the month out. Another main point, which may be something that happens everywhere: the main general manager is always, and I mean always, late. They frequently tell me this via WhatsApp, rather than updating their rota to their usual arrival time. Frequently, they leave early as well, passing by me with their stuff on the way out asking if we are ready to leave (seriously?).

\- This is something that cannot be changed but provides a POV. The tips for this restaurant are shared in an odd way. Everyone receives tips at the end of the month, I believe based on your position, more than on how many tips were made on that day. What's the issue here: the previous other barista, who has roughly 20 years experience in hospitality, has shown greater skills than anyone in both FOH and BOH (and more than the managers who have roughly 2-3 years each in experience), gets roughly the same amount of tips as a part-time FOH who only works weekends. The amount? 8GBP of tips, for 1 month of work. Mind you, that previous barista was a full-time 40hours. Every workplace shares tips differently, I know, but it confuses me if this is a frugal situation, or if the managers amass the majority of tips for themselves.

I will proceed to my main thought at the moment. I would like to leave, because, as described by the previous barista of 20 years experience, this workplace is horrible and is poorly managed. He has managed to make us save a ton of money on monthly expenditures, thanks to the advice he has given us over his 5 months, but yet, has not been rewarded, or has not seen improvement. On our recent weekend day, in one year and a half, I almost felt like fainting towards the end of the day, with the fact that half the team was sent home, despite it still being busy and needing to prepare the closing down roles. At the same time, we had 3 people on their first shifts who required shadowing and being taught what to do. When they send people home early, they don't actually assign anyone else to cover that position being released, and so the restaurant starts becoming unorganized. These two managers start making their complementary weekend staff alcohol drink, while we are here rushing left and right to grab the reigns. I end up putting a quite frequent bad tone, where I don't talk to them or even respond back (this isn't the first time, and you can conclude why). A 19 year old girl, who works as FOH (and is actually leaving in a week), starts crying for all the weight that has now been put on her (this isn't the first time). Guess what she told me in private after the manager when to talk to her? She should consider talking to a doctor for anti-depression pills.

Here is what is stopping me from immediately giving my notice. I mentioned the salary to be 28k, but, based on my payslips, through the help of TRONC, I am apparently getting 30k per year (can confirm). I have also recently received a bonus on my monthly pay of 200GBP for hard work I put. My mother is suggesting, instead of closing the door and simply leaving, to try and talk to these managers, because she knows that if I leave, they would be in panic mode, and so I have leverage to reason with them in how to improve the situation. Mainly, how to avoid being so under stress and whatnot. However, she knows I want to leave anyways, but still pushes for me to discuss with those two. On this other side, I just had a trial shift at a coffee/bakery chain, where I was offered 30 minutes in a position as Team Leader/Supervisor for 14GBP per hour, which can increase to 15GBP at manager's discretion, depending on performance. I know it is quite a drop in money earned, but my rent is paid by my parents (their choice), and I split expenses with my girlfriend. I easily save and re-invest 400GBP every month into Vanguard anyways, so money has never been my drive, as you read from what I asked for my salary.

And sorry for making this so long. Another point to make is that my contract, while mentioning correctly my salary, start date etc. has wrong or misleading information. The minimum rest time between shifts of 11h has been frequently broken, sometimes closing for events at midnight, and starting again at 7:30AM. The operational hours written are incorrect by 4 hour difference. The 'Termination of Employment' section states that I need to consult the employee handbook for notice periods, but I was never given this to begin with. I have heard by word of mouth, that for my position, I would have a month notice period. However, through the gov.uk. website, I understand that the minimum is 1 week, and the employer is welcome to give more. I would give them 2 weeks max if I am able to. I don't quite understand who is correct and who isn't, but would like some advice on this part.

I know I should listen to my parents, but I also know that I would prefer to work in this other place, despite the lowered pay, because I can still live calmly without the extra money. I don't want to have to go through that fainting stress again. A big reason I don't want to stay is because I just don't agree with how things are carried out on a managerial standpoint within this restaurant. Even the owner, despite my lack of experience in hospitality, in my opinion, makes terrible decisions.

Not sure how to handle it. Thoughts?,"First off, thank you for reading this. I apologize in advance if I do or say the wrong thing. I did read the rules for this page but I’m admittedly not super familiar with the specifics of Reddit. But I see posts like these all the time shared onto other social media platforms, and they seem to be a good way to get advice, so here I am. 

Sorry for the context. One thing about me is that I apologize probably way more than I should and I always feel the need to provide context/background for things. Anywho. 

I work for a small office in the insurance industry. Our office is small but we represent one of the largest home and auto insurance companies in the entire US. There’s 2 full time employees (myself and a coworker we will call Amanda), plus a part time employee we recently hired — we’ll call him Alex. Alex does not have any insurance licenses, so he is forbidden by law from discussing a lot of things w/ the clients— basically anything to do w/ coverage. His main function is to solicit quotes from potential clients — I.e. taking down any info needed to run the quote. He basically takes messages. 
Amanda and I both have numerous licenses between us (we both each have 4 different licenses in 2 different states. She was licensed about 6 months-1 year before I was.) so we handle the bulk of the work. Amanda’s job is to sell product and my job is to maintain relationships with current clients. My #1 job is to answer the office phone when it rings. Sometimes this can be difficult if we have a large amount of calls coming through. I will often find myself working on something for a client, and before I can finish it, I will have to take a call from another client who also needs something. It’s fine, it’s my job, and I know what I signed up for. Granted, I expected there to be an understanding that if we were slammed, the time between someone calling and their request being fulfilled might take a bit longer. It always gets done, but sometimes it takes a little. I’m only one human, I thought this was obvious. Amanda does answer the phone if I am already working with a client, and I appreciate that. While it’s not part of her job description per se, she is expected to help our clients if they need it, provided she is available to help. I like Amanda as a person, but as a coworker, she’s starting to get on my nerves. She is 30 minutes late to work every. single. day. I swear to you that I am not exaggerating this for my benefit. I can post texts from her if needed. But she is always late and it’s always for some stupid ass, silly reason. Like, she can’t remember if she closed her garage door, or unplugged her hairdryer, or locked her dog’s crate. Or maybe she spilled coffee on her shirt and had to turn around, or she forgot her phone/wallet/laptop/purse at home and had to turn around. It’s always something. And it frustrates me because she has time to wake up at the asscrack of dawn, take her dog to the park, go to Starbucks, go back home, shower, do her makeup, post photos of her dog’s walk on Instagram, but she cannot for the life of her get to work on time. I wake up 3 hours later than she does and I manage to get there on time (although lately I’ve tried to stop caring and I’ll be 5 minutes late at the most). Granted, she is doing more than I am in the morning — but she chooses to do that stuff. And every single day I have to hear about how sorry she is. I want to say, “if you were actually sorry, you’d stop being late.” Our boss is RARELY in the office when we open, so he never sees this either. There’s only 3 workers in the office, so I feel like it would be extremely obvious if I snitched. I also don’t really want to do that, but I also don’t feel like I can have a direct conversation with Amanda about this. I’ve tried gently broaching the subject and she always cuts me off, says she’s sorry, she’s working on it, blah blah blah then the next day she’s back on her BS. I also am not convinced that my boss would even care. Part of the reason I feel so aggravated and hurt is that he is constantly heaping praise upon Amanda but the only time I hear from my boss is when it’s a critique of something I *could’ve done better*. I feel like I could sell a $10,000,000 life insurance policy and his response would be “you could’ve sold them a $20,000,000 policy”. And I know that some boss’s ideas of encouragement is setting higher expectations for certain people, but it does not feel like that’s what’s happening here. I honestly feel like the ugly step sister. Amanda’s job is to make money for our boss, and she does do that. But she acts like she runs the office. She comes and goes as she pleases and expects everyone else to be on her time. There have been several instances in which I was drowning in work and had to stop doing what I was doing in order to close a sale for her. Mind you - she gets paid for that, not me, even though I drop everything I’m doing just to help Amanda with something that she’s going to get the money & praise for. It’s irritating to say the least. And what’s worse? I get told that I’m not completing my tasks quick enough. When a client calls, my boss will come out of his office and hover over my shoulder to see how long I’ve been on the phone and who I’m talking to. He will chide me for wasting time on the phone when 1. It’s his fucking clients I’m talking to and 2. I’ll have been on the phone for 7 minutes tops. I’m not sure what he expects me to do, I can’t hang up on an already frustrated client who is chewing me out for something that I usually have no control over. 

So that’s pretty much the gist of it. I have no idea how to navigate this. The job pays pretty well and when things aren’t crazy & Amanda is pulling her weight, it’s actually a pretty sweet gig. I do also believe I’m good at what I do. I worked really hard to get licensed — I taught myself everything. I didn’t have any schooling. I just studied the laws and took some tests. And I passed on my first try for each license. But even knowing all this, I still have times where self doubt creeps in. Anyway, I’m sorry, I’m not trying to make this a therapy type thing, I know this is a page for career advice. I guess what I’m asking is had anyone experienced something similar? How did you handle it? I don’t really want to just up and quit my job. I feel like I too often do that and I’d like to establish myself somewhere for once before I up and leave. Any advice would be awesome and if you read all this, I love you and thank you for taking time out of your day to help me with mine. ",1,1742938568.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

I used to take Motrin a lot during my periods but those have been gone since August. Now I only take it maybe once a month. I won’t take it anymore though.

Is there anything else I should do to figure out the root cause before I dive into diet and supplements?

I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I rarely have soda. I have the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee a day. The rest of my diet is mostly convenience type food like frozen meals, cereal, sandwiches etc. so that can be improved. Aside from a strict diet, I’m just not sure what else to do.",1,1742938465.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1jjv1n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1jjv1n2/saying_i_love_you_getting_over_the_fear_of_things/,Saying I love you… getting over the fear of things going badly… and am I interpreting correctly?,"Sorry for the loooonngggg read. 

I met a wonderful man (we communicate very well, needs are met, checks all the boxes, etc) one year ago this week. We’re both 43. We live two hours apart, and both have obligations that keep us close to home the majority of the time. 

Very early on, probably within our first few weeks of conversation,  open about how our past experiences have affected us. We are both “heart on sleeve” types who have been in some toxic relationships/marriages where our emotional needs were discounted, ignored, or abused. Or love bombed. So, though we both have a solid understanding of what is involved, neither of us really have any experience in a healthy relationship. 

Also, (I’m very in tune with my intuition) he’s given me zero reason to question his honesty or motivations. 

 He shared during one of these early conversations that he would likely fall in love with me first, but that he will not say “I love you” until I do. 

We are also both very much of the belief that some things need to be discussed in person. And that includes the first expression of love. 

We saw each other regularly (2-3 weekends per month at my house, his house, or a destination) for all of April through August. I could see that he he was as emotionally invested as I was, maybe more. 

I felt that he was pulling back around mid-August, so I questioned him about it. He said that he was feeling some conflicting emotions and struggling badly with his mental health. Part of this was related to external factors. I gave him the option of my supporting him through it, or stepping back. He was very open and vulnerable, and said that, as much as he wanted me around and loved our time together, he didn’t feel that burdening me with that level of heavy need was fair to expect so early on. 

So, we stopped seeing each other. We did continue to communicate periodically until mid-September. At that point, I told him that I wasn’t able, due to how I feel about him, to continue to be on the sidelines indefinitely, and I needed to go no contact with him for awhile. He expressed that understood. He was very apologetic and expressed that he wished he could offer more, but that he didn’t have the capacity at the time as he was overwhelmed with his own struggles. 

I carried on with my life, accomplished several major goals (I’ve been on a mission since my marriage ended in 2022 to do things that I was not able or supported to do - getting a licence, fixing my finances, buying my first vehicle, weight loss, personal growth and healing, etc) and prepared for the upcoming holidays. 
I even went on a few dates. 

He doesn’t have children, and typically spends the holidays alone. I texted him at the end of November to ask if he wanted to join me and my adult/teen sons for holiday dinner. He was very grateful for the invitation and said that he was happy that I’d reached out. Said he missed our conversations. He asked if he could call, and I agreed. 

We talked for about 2 hours. He started off by again thanking me for the invitation for dinner, but said that he will be visiting his mother and sisters 4 hours away. Then, he proactively went into apologizing again for hurting me, said that he misses me and has “very strong feelings” for me, and asked if I would be comfortable with us talking again. I told him that yes, that would be fine. 

We have communicated daily since. The context of the conversation progressed from mostly messages and meme/reel sharing to phone and video calls over the holidays and into January. 

All the while, I continued to focus on my own life and goals. I was absolutely not focused on our talking. 

Near the beginning of February, he made a joking comment about Valentine’s Day approaching. I replied that it’s just another day and that (as we had discussed before) I can count how many times that someone has sent me flowers… and that I absolutely had no expectations of him. I said that I’d probably just spend it eating chocolate and watching bad movies… then I added jokingly that I have his mailing address, and that he should keep an eye on his mailbox. (We have a very fun dynamic and razz each other often). He replied that he has my address too.. then went on to say, very remorsefully, that unfortunately he had to work that entire weekend, and then said that he would have shown up, flowers in hand, and taken me out for dinner (he knows I’ve never had even half of that effort). 

I made up a little care package with a silver chain necklace (he was given one by his grandfather but he buried it with his best friend when they passed and I know he’s been missing it - culturally giving offerings is an important part of his beliefs), a wallet (I had been bugging him since I met him to put his old one out of its misery), a cute but funny card, and a keychain and mailed it to him. In the wallet, I had hidden a homemade piece of card there expressing things like my gratitude for our paths crossing and him being a part of my life in whatever capacity). 

I’m a gift giver. I never expect the same. He got it two days before Valentine’s Day, and video called me. He was teary eyed, thanked me profusely, and said that no one has ever put that much thought into any gift for him. 
He hadn’t even found the card in the wallet yet… when he did, he was speechless for a few seconds, then said “… wow… you know that I… really… just care about you”. 

We had a conversation that night about what had transpired between us, and he proactively apologized again, owned that his pushing me aside when he was struggling was wrong, and said that he doesn’t have words to express how grateful that he is that I haven’t completely dismissed him from my life. He then asked if I would be open to exploring more between us again. 

I told him that I would be, but that we need to have a conversation about “terms and conditions” (basically expectations, boundaries, etc). And that I needed there to be a plan, especially around time together and closing the distance. He agreed, and said that he wanted this conversation to be in person, which I agreed that it should be. And that I needed it to be sooner rather than later. I expressed that I needed to know what to expect, as the uncertainty of the past several months was triggering my anxiety.

We both had a lot preplanned for the rest of February, and I had two trips out of town, but we settled on March 8th. 

There were many conversations between, and several times he proactively expressed that he “has very strong feelings”, or “cares deeply” for me and that he wants to see me. 

March 6th, he told me that he was getting sick, March 7th he developed a horrible stomach flu. He apologized profusely and asked if I would agree to him coming to my town on his next days off. I agreed, adding “hopefully”

His first day off from work was March 19th. I was out of town from March 18-20th (late at night) and supposed to go out of town again on the 22nd but that was cancelled on the 21st. 

I told him that I would be home. He said he would come on the 22nd, then around noon that day, he texted saying that he was unwell (he has digestive issues), of course, apologizing. I just replied “Oh, ok.” 
He responded immediately, saying that he would come the next morning (Sunday), if I would allow it. 

He video called later that evening. I was quieter than usual. Not intentionally so, just a bit butt hurt and disappointed. He noticed immediately and said “I really….care about you… a lot… ummm… I’m really sorry”. We talked for a while, no mention of the next day. 

Sunday, I woke up and planned a lazy day for myself. He messaged good morning around 9:30, said he was “just taking a shower” around 10:30. I messaged back saying that I was having coffee and listening to an audio book. 

He was knocking at my door 2 hours later. I was still in pyjamas (long tshirt, nothing under). Not showered. Teeth not brushed. Looked an absolute mess. 

He followed me in through my porch, and once inside pulled me in for a huge hug (his love language is physical touch). I kept my face turned sideways against his chest (he’s 6’, I’m 5’2”) explaining that I didn’t want to offend him with my stank breath. He kind of chuckled and pressed his face into my hair. Not really a kiss but… more like nuzzling. 
I was admittedly in disbelief that he was, after so many months, in front of me again. 

I broke the hug after a good 60-90 seconds, and apologized again for the state of myself. We sat on my love seat and kind of nervous babbled for about 10 minutes while my extremely timid puppy (who had never met him) inspected him. 

He asked if I wanted to get out of the house and do something, I agreed and excused myself to shower. We are both very much the can’t sit still, too much nervous energy type. We took his vehicle (he does not really know much about my area) we picked up coffees, then he asked where I wanted to go. I said that it didn’t matter and if he had any place he needed or wanted to go (I live in the bigger of the two towns, and there are stores/resources here that he doesn’t have) we could. We drove for a bit, making small talk, and he drove us to the off the beaten path waterfalls where we had gone during our second weekend together. 

We parked, nervous chatted a little more, about work and upcoming summer and fall vacation plans. 
I mentioned only having so many holidays to use… he pipped in “well, and we’ll be using a bunch of those” 
I replied “will we?” 
Him- “well… terms and conditions”
Me - laughs “ok, there it is”
Him - “I care about you… a lot… and I want this to work.. I do not want it to work out like last time.“ (he was visibly nervous)
Me - “Same. Well… my biggest concerns are time… and you sir (playful poke in the shoulder) need to communicate and not leave me in the dark”
Him - “Agreed. You deserve that.”

We continued to discuss logistics and expectations. Settled on specifics and some longer term plans/ideas. 
Part way through, he started driving.. and ended up at the one of the locations from our first date (he had taken me to pick up something at a specialty store on that date as he had arrived early and I didn’t have time to pick it up beforehand). 

He mentioned it clear during our drive that he’d told his friends that he was coming to see me. 

He got a call from one of his tenants about an issue (he owns rental properties) and he needed to address it while we were in the vehicle. He answered it on Bluetooth (he’s always been transparent). He offered to take me out for dinner, but legitimately wasn’t hungry, and I suggested that he should probably go back sooner than later and address the issue with the tenant, and that I needed to do some prep for Monday stuff. 

We went back to my house. He walked me in, spent about 10-15 mins making out like teenagers, and then I joked with him that he’d better leave or he wasn’t going to want to. 
We have had sex previously and know enough of each other’s preferences to know what buttons to push, but he is 1000% a gentleman. 

He replied “that will wait.. I’m not going to ___ you and just leave… this isn’t about that for me”. 

He touched my face, almost looked like he wanted to say something, quickly kissed me again and left. 

He messaged within about 20 minutes of leaving, and said that he was relieved that the conversation went well. We’ve been communicating since. Much more similarly to how things were m prior to the “breakup”.

We have since firmed up plans to see each other at least 5 days out of the next month, spread over two weekends. And he commented last night about the renovations to his house this summer (that is part of the plan, I would move there as my job is portable, and he owns and I am currently renting). 

Sooo… I think it’s pretty obvious that I love this man. I just don’t really know (factoring in the breakup) if/when telling him how I feel is appropriate. 

And, like I mentioned, I’m used to love bombing not slow, gentle to develop love. 

I just don’t want to jump ahead and put pressure on him.

I am taking a science class with a lab and I have this classmate who, on the first day, was very interested in talking to me. She is my lab partner and is just my partner with every project we do in that class. She was sweet and started talking to me. However, I noticed she was kinda clingy the first time we started talking. Which is fine, I do not mind clingy people (to a point). However, she started acting more and more weird. She was just really negative to begin with, however, she would make comments like ""you can tell that professor was judging you when you asked that question in class."" and stuff like that, but then reassuring me that she herself wasnt judging, and that the professor is just a jerk. She would do weird stuff like that, which made me uncomfortable around my professor, but I didnt mind. She started sharing more and more of her personal life with me, which was kinda weirding me out, cause I only knew her for a couple of weeks and we were not friends or anything. But I didnt really think too much about it. She called me up one night, and talked a lot about her sex life, and talked a lot about a girl she regularly has sex with. I am not going to get too explicit, but she did say I looked like her crush, and went off on her weird situationship. I was kinda awkard and use the old ""I have class early tomorrow so I need to go to bed."" line after listening to her for a few hours. I rolled my eyes and went to bed (mind you, I barely knew this girl other than the fact she was my lab partner and classmate). However, I woke up the next morning and felt kinda weird about it. I realized I probably should try not to lead her on, and that maybe we should keep our relationship purely professional. However, after she talked about her sex life and compared me to her crush that she enjoys sleeping with, she invited me to go to her house (and was a little pushy with it). I said no and walked away. I decided to keep some distance, and I grew distant. She called and texted multiple times, and I ignored them. I eventually told her that I was going through a hard time and that I needed space (I was abused a lot as a teenager, and never really learned to set boundaries so that is part of my problem that I am actively working on). She left me alone.

The awkward thing is, we are lab partners. We are working on a research project. I noticed she kinda took over and didnt seem to really want me to be involved. She talked heavily to my other lab partner, but kinda barely looked in my direction. Its annoying, but at least I am not getting weird texts. Also, I said I needed space so she was probably respecting that. However, one particular day (last week) I was doing lab work and she decided she wanted to talk to me. She started to make...not inappropriate comments...but comments that, given our past interactions, made me a little uncertain. She then offered to buy me coffee, which I declined (I really really dont want to lead her on). Now we are working on another project together and its just too much. I cant focus cause she makes me uncomfortable, I genuinely feel uncomfortable around her. Like, I feel my heart race, my throat is choked, and I go mute when she is around. I know I need to get over this, but knowing everything I know, I just feel weird. I am thinking of talking to the professor about it (not totally tattling on her, but just asking him about how I should navigate the situation). Am I overreacting with how I feel and how I am thinking of handling it? I genuinely do not know. I grew up in a household where every negative feeling I felt, I was told to suck it up and not cause any problems.",1,1742938394.0,stories,2,1.0,False

1jjux45,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaylaWisnerSnark/comments/1jjux45/to_kaylas_supporters/,To: Kayla’s Supporters,"Hello Ladies,
I come in peace. It appears that most of you are genuinely good people, coming from a good place. I assume you relate to her in some way or feel sorry for her and/or her son and that’s what keeps you around, despite how terribly she treats you. I would bet that most of you have the “I want to save her” mentality, and that is admirable…to a point. 
I speak for everyone here when I say we all feel sorry for Ryley and worry about his well being and future. However, he is the only victim in this situation. Kayla has had plenty of chances to leave Aaron and has chosen not to do so. We all hear how she tells him to shut up and cusses at him. She is not scared of him. If anything, she feels sorry for him because he clearly isn’t able to be a man and survive in this world alone. I would bet that anytime she has actually left him (assuming that has happened) he has gotten down on his knees crying and begging her to come back. Maybe even threatened to harm himself. He is a very weak person and she knows it. She even married him after years of this same sick behavior. I am sure it was only to give them a better chance of avoiding having Ryley removed, but whatever the reason… she chose to do it. She chooses to live this way. She chooses to put their wants and addictions above her child’s needs on a daily basis. Cigarettes, coffee, alcohol, Red Bulls, make up, and skin care, are expensive and totally unnecessary, but always on hand. None of you are doing her any favors or good by supporting these wants and their behavior. They both have plenty of time to put toward a second job if finances are truly this tight. Aaron is simply too lazy to get one and too jealous to encourage Kayla to get one. Why do you think they have no friends or family (besides his brother) in their real lives? Because they have clearly used and abused them for so long they had no choice but to cut ties. People like this don’t appreciate or respect you for giving them your hard earned money. Words mean nothing to them. Pay attention to actions. They see you as a sucker to be preyed upon again and again. The more you give, the more they ask for and we can all see it daily. They don’t have to earn your money, you just hand it over. Handouts never encourage people with addict mentality to do better for themselves. They just reinforce their behavior since they are being rewarded for it. If any of you truly consider these things, there is no way it can be ok in your mind to keep supporting this insanity. The basic definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different outcome. Nothing is changing for the better in their lives. They are only getting worse and if you choose not to see that, you need more help than they do. These are not good or reformed people! They have stolen from innocent people that could have been your loved ones. They have manufactured and sold rugs to people that could have been your children or relatives! Obviously not yours, but someone’s! Let that sink in! These are cold hard facts that anyone can find with a Google search. They are still living the hustle of an addicts life. They haven’t changed, they have just made some adjustments to continue this lifestyle in a way that they can fly under the radar better. They have no reason to change because you won’t let them suffer the consequences of their bad choices! Surely you can all see her care for that baby declining. Engaging her in lives is only contributing to his neglect because she is scared she might miss a compliment or donation if she actually pays attention to him instead of you. Odds are good that he is going to get hurt badly one of these days due to her lack of attention and you will have his blood on your hands. There is no way a reasonable person can think the way she yells at and loses patience so quickly with him is ok. There is no way a good parent can ignore her neglect of his mental, emotional and physical development just so they can have someone to engage them in a late night chat. She doesn’t care about you anyway! No matter what any of you say to her about your life, she always finds a way to bring it back to herself!! HOW can you not see this and don’t you think you deserve better? 
None of us are jealous of anything about her. Who in their right mind would be? Name one thing in her life that is enviable. So all of you can stop with that defense.

Everytime I get a check-up at the dentist, I have more cavities, as well as MORE teeth that need to be monitored for later.


I brush my teeth and flush nearly everyday. I don't eat that much chocolate or candy, but I do have lots of sugar in my coffee.


Anyway, I also wanted to complain about how insufferable even having a cleaning is. Just thinking repeatedly how much I want to die because the dental assistant is scratching me teeth and vibrating them and stabbing my gums. Keeping my mouth open for 45 minutes, the sounds of screeching from the machine in my mouth, absolutely horrible, I hate it. And now I have an appointment to get my cavities filled, thats an even worse experience! They have to stab general anesthesia into my gums, fuck.


They also said that I have to buy some sort of extra flouride toothpaste to protect my teeth 😞 I read that cavities and CPTSD as well as Autism can be related. I've been so good taking care of my teeth and going to the dentist when I have insurance that covers it or some of it, but the cavities, dear God. I actually had to have a root canal a few years ago too! ",2,1742938031.0,AutismInWomen,2,1.0,False

1jjutfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jjutfh/the_weight_of_silence/,The Weight of Silence,"Dr. Evelyn Harper had seen her share of broken minds in her twelve years as a psychiatrist, but none had ever unsettled her like Julian Voss. He arrived at her Portland office on a rain-soaked evening in late March 2025, the kind of night where the city’s gray streets seemed to bleed into the sky. She’d been flipping through patient files, the hum of her desk lamp the only sound in the quiet room, when the phone rang—an unscheduled walk-in, the receptionist said, voice tight with unease. “He’s… insistent. Says it’s urgent.” Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. She’d planned to leave early, escape to her quiet apartment with a glass of wine and the patter of rain against the windows. But duty pulled her back. “Send him up,” she said, and braced herself.

Julian Voss was a lean figure, mid-thirties, with hollow cheeks and eyes like storm clouds—gray, restless, too deep for comfort. His dark hair was slicked back from the rain, clinging to his scalp, and his trench coat dripped puddles onto her hardwood floor. He carried no umbrella, no bag, just a stillness that made the air feel heavier. “Dr. Harper,” he said, his voice low, smooth, almost musical, “I need your help.” He sat without invitation, folding his long hands in his lap, his gaze locking onto hers with an intensity that made her shift in her chair.

She forced a professional smile, pen poised over her notepad. “What brings you here, Mr. Voss?”

He tilted his head, a faint smile tugging at his lips—not warm, but knowing, like he’d caught her in a lie she hadn’t told. “I hear things,” he said. “Voices. Not mine. They tell me things—secrets, truths, things I shouldn’t know.” He paused, watching her. “They told me about you.”

Evelyn’s pen froze mid-word. She’d heard delusions before—schizophrenia, paranoia, the usual suspects—but the way he said it, calm and certain, sent a chill down her spine. “What do you mean, about me?” she asked, keeping her tone steady.

“Your sister,” he said, leaning forward slightly. “Clara. She drowned when you were sixteen. You were supposed to watch her, but you didn’t. The guilt’s still there, isn’t it? A weight you can’t shake.”

Her breath caught, the room tilting. Clara. The lake. The scream swallowed by water. She’d never told anyone at the practice, kept it buried under years of therapy and careful lies. Her hand trembled, ink smudging the page. “How—how do you know that?” she whispered, professionalism cracking.

“The voices,” he said simply, leaning back, his smile gone. “They know everything. They see everything. And they won’t stop.”

Evelyn swallowed hard, forcing her mind to regroup. He’d dug into her past—somehow, somewhere—stalked her, maybe, or hacked her records. It wasn’t supernatural; it was calculated. She straightened, voice firm. “Let’s focus on you, Julian. Tell me about these voices. When did they start?”

He studied her, unblinking, then nodded, as if granting her a reprieve. “Six months ago. After the accident. I was driving—late, dark, a back road near Astoria. Hit something. A deer, I thought. Stopped to check, but there was nothing. No blood, no body. Just… silence. Then they started. Whispering at first, then louder. Names, dates, secrets. They don’t sleep. I don’t sleep.”

She scribbled notes—possible PTSD, auditory hallucinations, trauma trigger—her training a lifeline against the unease coiling in her gut. “What do they say?” she asked.

“Everything,” he murmured. “The cashier at the gas station—her husband’s cheating. The old man on the bus—he killed his brother in ’78, buried him under the porch. You—Clara’s blue swimsuit, the way the water turned black.” His eyes gleamed, dark and sharp. “They’re never wrong.”

Evelyn’s skin prickled. She wanted to call him a liar, a manipulator, but the details—the swimsuit, the exact shade of the lake—were too precise. She cleared her throat. “Have you told anyone else about this?”

“No,” he said, too quickly. “You’re the first. I trust you.” His gaze softened, a flicker of vulnerability that almost felt real. “I need you to make them stop.”

She should’ve referred him out—too personal, too strange—but something held her. Curiosity, maybe, or the faint hope she could unravel him. “We’ll start weekly sessions,” she said. “Meditation, maybe medication. We’ll figure this out.” He nodded, a ghost of relief crossing his face, and left without another word, the drip of his coat echoing down the hall.

The next week, Julian returned, sharper somehow, his trench coat dry but his eyes darker. He sat, hands folded, and began without preamble. “They told me about your patient. Michael Reese. Overdosed last year. You blame yourself.”

Evelyn froze, her coffee mug halfway to her lips. Michael—her failure, the one she couldn’t save, the one whose file still sat locked in her drawer. “Stop,” she snapped, slamming the mug down. “How are you doing this? Are you following me? Digging through my life?”

He raised his hands, placating. “I’m not. I swear. It’s them—the voices. They see what I can’t. I don’t want this.” His voice cracked, and for a moment, she saw a man drowning, not a monster. She wanted to believe him—needed to—and that scared her more than the secrets he spilled.

Sessions became a ritual, a dance of dread and fascination. He’d arrive every Tuesday at 6 p.m., rain or not, and unravel her world thread by thread. He spoke of her father’s affair in ’98, her mother’s quiet breakdowns, the time she’d cheated on her med school finals—things no one knew, things she’d buried so deep they’d fossilized. Each revelation chipped at her armor, but she clung to her role, prescribing SSRIs, teaching breathing exercises, probing his “accident” for cracks. He resisted, deflecting with charm or silence, and she grew to dread his footsteps in the hall.

Yet, a strange bond formed. He’d linger after sessions, asking about her day, her favorite books—The Bell Jar, she admitted once, and he quoted it back the next week, his voice soft as a caress. She caught herself smiling at his dry wit, his rare laughs, the way he’d tilt his head when she spoke, like she was the only thing in his world. She hated herself for it—transference, countertransference, a textbook mess—but she couldn’t stop. He was a puzzle, a wound, a mirror, and she was falling into him.

Three months in, the voices escalated. Julian arrived late one night, eyes wild, coat torn, hands shaking. “They’re louder,” he rasped, collapsing into the chair. “Screaming now. Not secrets—orders. They want me to do things. Bad things.” He gripped the armrests, knuckles white. “Last night, they told me to kill the neighbor’s dog. I didn’t—I locked myself in the bathroom, ran the shower till dawn—but I wanted to. I could feel it.”

Evelyn’s heart raced. “We need to adjust your meds,” she said, reaching for her prescription pad, but he grabbed her wrist, his touch cold and desperate. “It’s not the pills. It’s real. They’re real. And they know I’m here—with you.”

She pulled free, pulse hammering, but his words sank in. “What do they say about me?” she asked, dreading the answer.

He hesitated, then whispered, “They say you’re next.”

The room spun. She should’ve called security, had him committed, but his fear—raw, palpable—mirrored her own. “We’ll get through this,” she said, voice trembling. “Together.” He nodded, clinging to her promise like a lifeline, and she realized she meant it. She cared—too much—and that was her first mistake.

The next week, he didn’t show. She called his number—disconnected. Checked his address—a vacant lot in Astoria, no record of a Julian Voss. Panic clawed at her. She scoured her notes, his words replaying like a broken record: the accident, the voices, you’re next. On impulse, she drove to Astoria, the rain lashing her windshield, her gut screaming she’d lost him—or worse.

The back road was a ribbon of asphalt cutting through pines, dark and desolate. She found the spot he’d described—a sharp curve, a dented guardrail, no deer, no blood. She parked, flashlight in hand, the rain soaking her coat as she searched. Nothing—until her beam caught a glint in the ditch. A shard of glass, then another, leading to a mangled car frame, rusted and overgrown with weeds. Her breath hitched. No accident six months ago—this wreck was years old.

Back home, she dug deeper, hacking into old police records—a breach of ethics she didn’t care about. March 2018: a crash on that road, a man named Julian Voss, DOA. No survivors. Her hands shook as she pulled his photo—those eyes, that jaw, him. Dead seven years. Her patient was a ghost.

She didn’t sleep. The office felt wrong now, the lamp’s hum too loud, the shadows too long. She kept his file open, rereading every word, every secret he’d known. Clara, Michael, her father—how? The voices—he’d said they saw everything. Was he mad, or was he something else?

Tuesday came. 6 p.m. She sat at her desk, lights off, rain drumming the windows, waiting. The door creaked open, and there he was—Julian, dry despite the storm, his trench coat pristine, his smile soft and sad. “You figured it out,” he said, sitting as if nothing had changed.

“You’re dead,” she whispered, voice raw. “You died in that crash.”

He nodded, eyes glinting. “I did. But they didn’t. The voices—they kept me. Gave me a job.” He leaned forward, his breath cold against her face. “I tried to warn you, Evelyn. I liked you—really liked you. But they don’t.”

Her chest tightened. “Who are they?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he reached into his coat and pulled out a folded paper, sliding it across the desk. “Read it.”

Her hands trembled as she unfolded it—a police report, dated tomorrow. Her name, her office, her body found, throat slit, no suspect. “No,” she gasped, shoving it back. “This isn’t real.”

“It will be,” he said, standing. “They told me to do it. I fought them—for you—but I can’t anymore.” His voice broke, a tear streaking his cheek, and she saw the man she’d cared for, trapped in something bigger. “Run, Evelyn. Please.”

She bolted, grabbing her keys, her coat, stumbling into the hall. His footsteps followed, slow, deliberate, the air growing colder with each echo. She hit the stairwell, lungs burning, the hum of voices—not his, not human—swelling behind her. “Evelyn,” they whispered, a chorus of malice, “you can’t hide.”

She reached her car, tires squealing as she tore into the night, rain blurring the world. Her apartment was a fortress that night—locks bolted, lights blazing—but the hum lingered, seeping through the walls. She clutched her phone, ready to call for help, but who would believe her? A dead patient, a murder foretold, voices from nowhere?

Morning came, gray and silent. She didn’t leave, didn’t eat, just sat with Clara’s old photo—blue swimsuit, bright smile—waiting for the inevitable. At 6 p.m., a knock. She froze, heart in her throat, but it was just the mail slot—a single envelope, no stamp. Inside, a note in Julian’s neat script: I’m sorry. I tried. Below it, a new report—her name, tomorrow’s date, same fate.

The hum returned, louder, closer, and she knew he’d lost the fight. Her dark secret wasn’t Clara, or Michael, or her guilt—it was trusting him, loving him, letting him in. Now, the voices had her, and Julian’s hands—cold, inevitable—were theirs.",1,1742937906.0,scarystories,0,0.67,False

I am taking a science class with a lab and I have this classmate who, on the first day, was very interested in talking to me. She is my lab partner and is just my partner with every project we do in that class. She was sweet and started talking to me. However, I noticed she was kinda clingy the first time we started talking. Which is fine, I do not mind clingy people (to a point). However, she started acting more and more weird. She was just really negative to begin with, however, she would make comments like ""you can tell that professor was judging you when you asked that question in class."" and stuff like that, but then reassuring me that she herself wasnt judging, and that the professor is just a jerk. She would do weird stuff like that, which made me uncomfortable around my professor, but I didnt mind. She started sharing more and more of her personal life with me, which was kinda weirding me out, cause I only knew her for a couple of weeks and we were not friends or anything. But I didnt really think too much about it. She called me up one night, and talked a lot about her sex life, and talked a lot about a girl she regularly has sex with. I am not going to get too explicit, but she did say I looked like her crush, and went off on her weird situationship. I was kinda awkard and use the old ""I have class early tomorrow so I need to go to bed."" line after listening to her for a few hours. I rolled my eyes and went to bed (mind you, I barely knew this girl other than the fact she was my lab partner and classmate). However, I woke up the next morning and felt kinda weird about it. I realized I probably should try not to lead her on, and that maybe we should keep our relationship purely professional. However, after she talked about her sex life and compared me to her crush that she enjoys sleeping with, she invited me to go to her house (and was a little pushy with it). I said no and walked away. I decided to keep some distance, and I grew distant. She called and texted multiple times, and I ignored them. I eventually told her that I was going through a hard time and that I needed space (I was abused a lot as a teenager, and never really learned to set boundaries so that is part of my problem that I am actively working on). She left me alone.

The awkward thing is, we are lab partners. We are working on a research project. I noticed she kinda took over and didnt seem to really want me to be involved. She talked heavily to my other lab partner, but kinda barely looked in my direction. Its annoying, but at least I am not getting weird texts. Also, I said I needed space so she was probably respecting that. However, one particular day (last week) I was doing lab work and she decided she wanted to talk to me. She started to make...not inappropriate comments...but comments that, given our past interactions, made me a little uncertain. She then offered to buy me coffee, which I declined (I really really dont want to lead her on). Now we are working on another project together and its just too much. I cant focus cause she makes me uncomfortable, I genuinely feel uncomfortable around her. Like, I feel my heart race, my throat is choked, and I go mute when she is around. I know I need to get over this, but knowing everything I know, I just feel weird. I am thinking of talking to the professor about it (not totally tattling on her, but just asking him about how I should navigate the situation). Am I overreacting with how I feel and how I am thinking of handling it? I geniunely do not know. I grew up in a household where every negative feeling I felt, I was told to suck it up and not cause any problems. Plus, she never DID anything inappropriate, it was just things she said. Idk if maybe she is just trying to be friendly and I am missing cues? Please help.",3,1742937371.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

& when I found out it'd take that long I started looking for pain pills which shamefully lead me to the dreaded fentynal! 

After nearly a year & thousands I'm happy to say I wheen'ed myself off ..
15 devastating days & im now 2 months clear...HOWEVER I'm drained with little to no energy & ive gotta work as the mortgage doesn't wait. So I've been doing my research & after seeing so many POSITIVE reviews, I said to myself what's the downfall ??
Jesus after reading all this 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 
Yes I've tried energy drinks ,Brazilian & Colombian coffee drank 4 total this morning 
& nothing ive a ridiculous high tolerance since ive been dealing with my pain & agony since 2009 
When a drunk smashed my car breaking my neck & having to wear a halo Screwed into my head for 8 months .
 
Sadly life is painful & have no sympathy for the person next to me complaining of ""pain"" 

There was an individual who stated about withdrawal after 5-6 hours .







I guess I'm trying to find out how long & or consumption before you start withdrawals?????although my pump may off set it BUT it sure as hell didn't at the time help when stopping the fentynal 






Rite now my pain pump / morphine/ is so weak that It doesn't even help when I'm out & about in 40 degree weather in Las Vegas.. still got joint pain🤦‍♂️ 
If someone can chime in on my question it'd be greatly appreciated! I'm 45 & not getting younger...God Bless & truly happy for those whom stopped! As I know that feeling all to well.",2,1742937234.0,Quittingfeelfree,0,1.0,False

My friends are calling me an idiot if I'm spending >50% of my monthly take-home post-taxes on rent.

For instance, I found this really awesome high-rise apartment 1 bed convertible 5 minutes from the hospital for $2400 a month (not including utilities or parking which would probably increase the total rent to $2800). Comes with a garage assigned parking space, in-unit laundry/dryer, a gym, study lounges, free coffee machine, pool, and is walking distance to two major grocery retailers. 

About 10 minutes from the hospital I found several older buildings with 1 beds for $1850 (not including utilities) with in unit laundry/dryer and uncovered parking but doesn't come with any amenities like a gym or a pool. I would have to drive to get groceries.

I'm already in $350,000 in debt from med school so my parents were gracious enough to give me an allowance of $500 a month. 

I imagine that as a resident, any payments I make on my debt will be like hitting a military tank with can of Coca-cola. It's not going to make a dent. As long as make sure interest doesn't continue to skyrocket my principal, I can spend the rest of my money on quality of life & emergency funds.

1jjuhkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1jjuhkn/au_returned_from_maternity_leave_and_facing_issues/,[AU] returned from maternity leave and facing issues,"I recently returned from maternity leave to my role as a team lead. While I was away, one of my team members temporarily took on some of my responsibilities. When I came back, my manager confirmed that my role remained the same, and I began catching up on projects.

At first, everything seemed fine, but then I noticed a shift in this team member’s behavior. She became cold, distant, and uncooperative. It started three months ago when she snapped at me during a team meeting. I addressed it with her separately, and she apologized, saying she didn’t realize she was being rude. I brushed it off but made my manager aware so he had context.

Not long after, I had a discussion with my manager about my increased workload and whether we needed maternity cover for her upcoming leave. He decided another team member should take on her work once she goes rather than myself as I would be at max capacity. He called her into the meeting to inform her. From that point on, her attitude toward me worsened. When I later asked her about her behavior, she told me I was the one triggering all of this and that I shouldn’t have had that meeting without her. I explained that I was simply raising my own capacity concerns, but she remained cold and dismissive.

In the same conversation, she also claimed that our manager and another senior leader had offered her my role while I was on leave. She said she never wanted the role and that it was mine anyway, but the way she said it made me question whether she felt she was still in charge. I found this concerning since my manager had assured me my position hadn’t changed.

Her hostility continued—she avoided me, was uncooperative in meetings, and I heard from others that she was speaking negatively about me behind my back. Wanting to clear the air, I invited her and another colleague for a casual coffee chat. Instead of a constructive conversation, she turned to me and said, “Do you want sympathy? Do you want empathy? There are plenty of other mothers who have had emergency deliveries.” Then she walked off, leaving the conversation unfinished.

I later spoke to my manager about this, but he downplayed it, saying maybe she’s stressed, doesn’t like being managed, or had too many meetings. The next day, despite her previous comments, I still tried to offer input when she needed help, only for her to shut me down with a short “I’m busy.”

This has been ongoing for three months. I’ve tried to stay professional, but I feel like I’m being shut out and undermined. Has anyone else experienced something like this after returning from leave? How did you handle it? Would appreciate any advice. Thinking to go HR now but what stand would HR take in this matter?",0,1742937109.0,AskHR,2,0.5,False
1jjuhco,https://www.reddit.com/r/panicdisorder/comments/1jjuhco/chest_flutters/,Chest Flutters,"Hi everyone,

I really hope someone can help me. I’m a 25-year-old male and have been dealing with anxiety-related physical symptoms for years, but something changed recently, and it’s become overwhelming.

I had my first fluttering sensation about 10 years ago during a family vacation around New Year’s. At the time, I had a heart ultrasound, EKG, and blood work—all of which came back normal.

Since then, I’ve occasionally felt palpitations or strange sensations, but it was manageable. Things took a major turn right before this New Year’s. A few days earlier, I was teaching accordion at a student’s house. That morning, I drank coffee on an empty stomach—and the fluttering hit hard. I was scared, but I powered through. Two or three days later, it got so intense I ended up in the emergency room.

Since then, it’s been happening almost every single day. I feel a weird flutter or tension in my lower stomach or chest, and my heart rate can shoot up to 140 BPM just from fear. It can happen when I lie in bed, bend forward, walk in the woods, or even when I’m just sitting alone at home. Sometimes it hits in public—like in a mall.

I’ve never fainted, never felt dizzy, and my heartbeat always seems regular—it just speeds up and pounds harder from panic.

What’s really messing with me is that I know my heart is okay. I’ve had several EKGs, blood tests, and an abdominal ultrasound (I even asked the doctor if he could see a hiatal hernia, and he said everything looked fine). Years ago, I also had a heart ultrasound. Everything keeps coming back normal.

But I’m stuck in this daily cycle of fear. I even use a stethoscope to listen to my heart whenever I lie down or feel something weird. Once, the flutter happened while I was listening—and my heart was beating completely normally. And still, the fear takes over.

It feels like I’m being tortured from the inside. Lately, I’ve even thought about going to a psych ward or back to the ER just to escape it. I’m a medical student (so I understand how the heart works), and I already deal with a lot of stress—but this is affecting my studies, my relationship, and my family. I do believe I can live a normal life again, but I just don’t know how to get there.

Last year, after moving abroad to study, I started drinking more than usual—about 3–4 beers a night to help me sleep. I’ve stopped now, but I wonder if that might have contributed to all of this. I also tend to eat a lot of takeout or order food late at night after studying—not necessarily junk food, but not the healthiest either.

I did extensive blood work after New Year’s, but I’m now considering testing for vitamin or mineral deficiencies. I’m also thinking about trying acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, or even bioresonance therapy. I’ve booked a gastroscopy soon, just to rule everything out.

As for medications, I’m currently taking:
	•	Beta-blockers (Concor Cor 1.25 mg/day)
	•	Fluoxetine/Prozac (called Fodiss here in Europe – 2x20 mg = 40 mg/day)
	•	Xanax (Hellex) as needed—usually before sleep or after waking up when it gets really bad.

I really need to know—has anyone experienced something like this? If so, how did you treat it and recover? I believe I can get back to a normal life, but right now I feel trapped, and I just want peace again.

I'm talking like in bars/coffee shops/at shows. I've stopped dating coworkers (yayyyy go me🪅🪅🪅🌸🎀🥳) and for many many reasons I don't do meetups/group sports/group activities/ect. (Plz plz plz dont suggest or mention these things I really dont want to get into it but they dont work for me.)

And now w where my sexuality is it, it's gotten harder to decide who I even would want to talk to. 

  
I know there's a chance ppl will suggest just talking to ppl and getting to know them, and I'm open to it if that's really what I have to do. But w being shy and it being literally scary to learn this new skill- I'd like to avoid some disappointment where possible (not trying to go overboard just trying to be kind to myself) so like if anyone has tips on how to read ppl/ppl watch/read a room w/out being creepy or weird or like in general- how to act/talk/draw attention to myself in positive ways that would make ppl want to talk to me (gender isn't as important on this one.)

1jjua5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1jjua5o/starbucks_hostility/,Starbucks Hostility,"I don’t really come here, but I need somewhere to ask…does anyone think Starbucks is getting more and more hostile?

I’ve been going to the same Starbucks for three years. In that time, I feel like the Starbucks has grown more and more hostile.

I don’t mean the people, who are simply human beings trying to navigate the world. But the policies they employ have grown, to me, more closed off and bizzare.

It started with food. I spent the better part of a year getting food from nearby restaurants and leisurely eating at the Starbucks. When they got a new manager, the policy apparently changed, and I found out if I brought outside food in I would have to leave. Ok, that’s deeply unfortunate. I didn’t bring any more, but ultimately it was fine.

Months later they tell me that there’s a new store policy and I have to buy something to stay there. I always get a drink, but I felt immediately sad because i had met my ex girlfriend there and she would just sit and quietly knit without getting anything. 

Next, they let me know that bathrooms also need to be paired with buying something in order to prevent people from “loitering” in the store. 

And finally, I was approached recently and told that I would be banned if I left my stuff unattended to go outside, go to other shops for a bit or take a phone call.

That a bag was “suspicious” and that while each employee knew my name and had even drawn me
on cups for fun, that they were required to call the police if I left my bag unattended. That was the cold water, the wake up call, the bizzare paranoia directed at someone everyone knew wasn’t a terrorist or any such bullshit.

I feel…uncomfortable. The place seemed to be a Third Place, somewhere were people can gather and enjoy themselves. Now it feels like the company is progressively moving away from cafe life and towards being an institution that dumps coffee in people’s hands as they go to work. I don’t have a big condo, I don’t want to live with nowhere to go. Restaurants, cafes and even book stores seem to be driving towards this hostile environment where nobody’s supposed to go anywhere but a restaurant and then home.

I woke to the feeling of exposure.

The air was sharp against my skin, the last embers of the fire waving goodbye at me with a flicker. My body protested as I shifted, muscles stiff from a night of uneasy sleep. As I sat up I noticed my door was open.

Not cracked—wide open.

The sight of it confused me. The last thing I remembered was Sam closing it for the night, sealing me in with the  fire and the wind howling beyond the cabin walls. But now it yawned open, an invitation or a violation—I couldn’t tell which.

Then I saw the clothes.

Neatly folded at the foot of my bed, a fresh outfit waited for me. A sweater, thick pants, even socks and a pair of boots set just beside the blankets. Thoughtful. Except for one thing.

The color.

A deep, vivid red. My first thought was how It would bleed against the white of the snow, a flare, a beacon, if I dared step outside in my condition. My pulse ticked up as I ran my fingers over the fabric, the knit soft and delicate.

These were home made.

I swallowed against the dryness in my throat, glancing toward the door again. The cabin was silent, but my thoughts overwhelmed it.

There was nothing wrong with taking what was given to me. That’s what I told myself as I pulled the sweater over my head, its weight settling on my shoulders. Sam had saved me. He’s given me shelter, food, care for my leg, clothing-I owed him at least a little trust, didn’t I?

Still, that nagging sensation remained—like a thread snagged in my brain. 

I pulled the boots on, noticing one was recently restitched together and bigger. This one must’ve been purposely made bigger for my leg… my bandages didn’t unravel and no pain was felt as my foot settled into the boot. 

So thoughtful. So careful. 

I hobbled to the hallway and looked around at the scene before me.

The cabin was dim, the fire in the main room roaring with a vengeance . A heavy stillness hung in the air, broken only by the occasional creak of wood and the soft pop of embers. The kitchen sat just beyond the living area, a single plate resting on the counter, crumbs scattered beside it. Someone had been up before me.

Carrie, probably.

I turned my head slightly, glancing toward the hallway’s end. The door. The one she disappeared behind last night. It looked the same in daylight—warped wood, rusted handle—but now, in the morning hush, it felt different. It felt like the entrance to a crypt. Looming and cold.

Before I could think about opening that door- I moved toward the kitchen instead.

Sam’s voice broke the silence before I reached it. “Morning.”

I startled but masked it quickly, turning to find him standing near the fireplace, coaxing the flames. He was already dressed, the sleeves of his sweater pushed to his elbows, exposing forearms lined with faint, pale scars. He didn’t seem to notice me staring.

“Morning,” I said, forcing the word past my lips.

His eyes flicked toward me, and something unreadable passed behind them. “Clothes fit okay?”

I nodded, even though the sweater felt a size too big, the pants slightly stiff like they hadn’t been worn in years. “Yeah. Thanks.”

Sam gave a small, satisfied nod. “Good.” He straightened, stretching his shoulders before moving toward the kitchen. “Coffee?”

I hesitated. “Sure.”

It was strange, this quiet normalcy. Like a scene playing out from a life that wasn’t mine. He poured a cup and slid it across the counter, the ceramic scraping against the wood. I wrapped my hands around it, letting the heat sink into my skin.

“Carrie’s still asleep?” I asked.

Sam stirred his own coffee, watching the liquid swirl. “She was up late.”

I thought of the plate on the counter. The door at the end of the hall. The way she had slipped inside so quickly, so quietly.

I let my gaze drift around the cabin. The front door was locked—two deadbolts, one at the top, one at the bottom. A row of hooks near the entrance held coats, all neutral in color. The windows were small, the glass fogged over from the cold outside.

My stomach knotted. It was warm, safe, but it didn’t feel like a home.

Sam took a slow sip of coffee. “Feeling alright?”

I forced a small smile. “Yeah. Just tired.”

He nodded, like he expected that answer. “You should rest today. Take it easy.”

I lifted the cup to my lips, letting the warmth burn down my throat. “What’s your plan for today?”

Sam leaned against the counter, arms crossing loosely over his chest. “Nothing much. Storm’s still heavy, so we’re stuck here for now. Roads are useless. Can’t get down the mountain a lick.”

I nodded like that made sense, like I wasn’t already wondering when the roads would be clear, when I’d be able to leave.

“Do you need help with anything?” I asked.

Sam studied me for a moment before shaking his head. “Just…make yourself at home.”


I nodded and sipped my coffee again, letting the steam kiss my face. There was no reason not to trust him. No reason to doubt his intentions.

No reason at all.


By mid-afternoon, the wind outside had eased into a low, steady howl. Snow battered against the windows in thick, swirling flurries, and the sky remained a dull, oppressive gray. I had spent the morning pretending to settle in—drinking coffee, staring out at the frozen wilderness, answering Sam’s occasional small talk with quiet nods. But every second, my mind had been elsewhere.

On Carrie. On the locked doors. On the way Sam spoke to me. 


Carrie emerged from the hallway around noon, her small frame wrapped in an oversized sweater, dark hair pulled into a low braid. She moved carefully , like she was trying not to take up too much space.

Sam barely looked up from the fireplace. “You slept late.”

Carrie gave a hesitant smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Was up late.”

I watched the exchange closely. Her voice was quiet, and small. 

Sam exhaled through his nose, tossing another log onto the fire.  “Get lunch started, she hasn’t ate all day.”

Carrie nodded quickly, stepping into the kitchen without another word.

I glanced at Sam. He was focused on the flames, lost in thought.

Now was my chance.

I set my empty cup down and followed Carrie into the kitchen. She was already at work, moving between the cabinets, pulling out bread, canned soup, a small cutting board. I hovered near the counter, pretending to be interested in what she was doing.

“You need help?” I asked.

Carrie shook her head. “I got it.”

I hesitated before lowering my voice. “You were up late last night.”

Her hands froze for half a second. Not long enough to be obvious, but I saw it.

She kept her eyes on the cutting board. “Yeah.”

I needed answers.

I watched the exchange closely. Her voice was quiet, but there was something else beneath it. Something careful.

Sam exhaled through his nose, tossing another log onto the fire. “Make yourself useful and get lunch started.”

Carrie nodded quickly, stepping into the kitchen without another word.

I hesitated before lowering my voice. “You were up late last night.”

Her hands froze for half a second. Not long enough to be obvious, but I saw it.

She kept her eyes on the cutting board. “Yes. It keeps being brought up.”

I waited for her to elaborate, but she didn’t.

“You brought food to that room.” My words came out carefully, watching for her reaction.

She tensed. Just slightly. Then, quickly, she recovered.

“Sam has a workshop in there,” she said. “Building and preparing supplies. I brought him a snack.”

She was sharp and answered quick.

I leaned in slightly. “Carrie.”

She finally looked at me. For the first time since I woke up here, I saw something crack in her expression. Fear.


Her eyes flickered toward the main room, where Sam was still tending to the fire. Then, so low I barely heard it, she muttered, “don’t.”

A chill ran through me.

Before I could respond, Sam’s voice cut through the room.

“Something wrong?”

I turned quickly. He was watching us. Not openly suspicious, but aware.

Carrie shook her head, already back to slicing bread. “Just talking about what I’m making.”

Sam’s gaze lingered for a second before he turned back to the fire.

I exhaled slowly, forcing my hands to stay steady.

Don’t?

Don’t what?


After lunch, I tried something small.

“Mind if I step outside for some air?”

Sam looked up from his spot near the fire. His expression didn’t change, but something about his posture did.

“It’s too cold,” he said simply. “Storm’s still bad. Cold will shock your nerves. Not good for leg.”

I nodded. 

An hour later, I walked toward the front door as casually as possible. Just stretching my legs, just looking around. My fingers brushed the handle.

It didn’t budge.

Locked.

I turned slightly, glancing toward the windows. Small, thick-paned, If I pressed my hand against the glass, I wasn’t even sure my own palm would show through.

I swallowed, stepping back before Sam could notice.

That night, I waited.

I stayed in my room, listening to the crackle of the fire, and thumbing around the trinkets and books in the room. Eventually, the cabin grew still.

I gave it another hour. Maybe two. Then, as silently as I could, I slipped out of bed.

The floor was cold beneath my socks. I hobbled slowly, keeping close to the wall as I eased my way down the hall. Every step sent my pulse higher, my breath tighter.

Carrie’s door was closed. So was Sam’s.

I reached the end of the hall.

The old, warped door stood in front of me. The handle rough under my hand. 

I turned it slowly.

It didn’t move.

Locked.

Of course.

I was about to turn away when I heard something.

A noise.

From the other side of the door.

A faint, shuffling movement.

I held my breath. Pressed my ear closer.

And then—

A whisper.

So weak, so soft, I almost thought I imagined it.

“…please…”

The blood in my veins turned to ice.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over my own feet. My breath caught in my throat, and for a second, I couldn’t move. Pain shot through my leg as I realized I steadied myself on my injury. 

Someone was in there.

I turned sharply, hurrying back toward my room, every nerve in my body screaming. I had to act normal. I had to pretend I hadn’t heard anything.

I reached my door—

And froze.

Sam was standing in the hallway.

Watching me.

The dim light from the fire flickered against his mask, casting long, sharp shadows over his face. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t move.

For a long, suffocating moment, we just stood there.

Then, finally, his head tilted slightly.

“You shouldn’t wander at night.”

The words were soft. Calm.

A warning.

My hands clenched at my sides. “I—I just needed water.”

His gaze didn’t waver.

Then, after a beat, he nodded toward the kitchen. “Then get some. You could trip on something and hurt your leg more with it being so dark.” 

I forced myself to move, to walk past him like I wasn’t shaking. I poured a glass, my hands steady only because I willed them to be.

When I turned back, he was gone.

I swallowed hard and went to my room, closing the door behind me.

I didn’t sleep.

Because now, I knew one thing for sure.

It was just me, Carrie, and Sam stuck in this house.

1jju8vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jju8vq/my_best_friend_ruined_my_birthday_vacation/,My Best Friend Ruined My Birthday Vacation.,"    Throwaway because best friend in question has seen my main. Lets start with some background. My (21F) best friend (21M) and I have been inseparable since 5th grade. We had our disagreements and drama within our friend group, but at the end of the day we always ran back to eachother. For a large portion of highschool the two of us were romantically involved, but he ended up finding a guy he really liked and we called it off. Huge mess, I could get into the details but that would be a whole other post. Time moved on, we remained friends, I ended up with I guy I truely plan to spend my life with, all is good.

     Now in August of 2023 I was turning 20. I knew nobody would do anything special except maybe my boyfriend (we were freshly together at the time) and I finally had a stable part time job and disposable income since I was living with my dad, so I wanted to take matters into my own hands and plan a trip to my favorite place in the world, the U.P. of Michigan. I planned this trip and saved up for it for months before hand, and say like 7-8 months to be specific. It was a 6hr car ride north, but I had saved the money to rent a hotel for two nights, buy three days of food(i.e. snacks/restaurants), and do all the things I'd always wanted to do. My boyfriend helped me budget everything, it was perfect.

     I invited my best friend, I'll call him Alex, to come with his boyfriend, we'll use Rylei. I figured it would be nice to have my three favorite people with me (I talked to and hung out with the two of them frequently at this point) and had budgeted for them to come so if they agreed I could pay, they did. I warned them beforehand that I'd be looking to go on hikes to see waterfalls and rock hunt (I'm a huge rock nerd lol) and wouldn't be doing much inside. Alex has POTS so he has issues standing and walking for too long, and on bad days he needs anywhere from a cane to a wheelchair. Knowing this I offered we could do seperate things if it gets to be too much or one of us could carry him in an emergence (my boyfriend loves exercising and offered, as did Rylei). Im saying all this to preface that I tried to make sure he'd be comfortable on the trip and be able to have fun with us.

     Ok now the actual story. Straight from the get go, things were a bit rough. Alex took a nap on the way there while Rylei drove, so the three of us chatted while he slept. I admit, I tend to talk pretty loud, so when he rightfully told me to be quiet I quieted down. About thirty minutes later I accidentally started talking too loudly again and out of nowhere he lifts his head and literally shouts ""You're still screaming!!"" This scared the shit out of me (I have bad issues with yelling and loud noises) so I didnt talk for about an hour and my boyfriend just held me. Alex woke up later and acted like nothing happened.

     As the trip progressed, Alex had an issue with everything we tried to do. Me and my boyfriend found some cool waterfall trails and asked Alex if they'd be too long for him, specifically long before we decided with each trail, right before the trail, and we'd check in with him during as well. Each time he was ok with it until we were on the trail and then would complain about fatigue or his service dog having issues or something of the like. We stopped hikes early to make sure we could get him back to the car, and at one point him and Rylei broke off from me and my boyfriend to get back to the car because he was just so fed up with the hike and couldn't see the waterfall clearly, even though we showed him a bench closer to the waterfall just a few yards away (no more than 15 seconds of walking, I'm serious) where him and his service dog could sit for a while in the shade.

     The food was always a fight everyday. Me and my boyfriend had planned for us all to go out 3 times and the rest would be snacks bought from local stores. Choosing restaurants was a nightmare. Everything we chose was either too weird looking, he didnt trust it, etc. My favorite part was when me and my boyfriend excitedly offeredly a nice looking rustic pizza place and he looked up at us after looking it up as if we'd just asked him to eat a baby and said ""this place looks fucking disgusting."" Every night was mortifying and I kept apologizing to my boyfriend in private because Alex was so negative and belligerent. My boyfriend was very kind and understanding, admitting he didnt like the behaviour either. Eventually he talked to Rylei about it because he was very mad about the food at one of the restaurants we actually ended up going into to eat (the only one) and straight up not talking or responding to us. Rylei apologized and suggested it was because Alex was used to getting whatever he wants (spoiled child) and he was still growing out of that. He'd done these things before not to this extreme, just discontentment and angry phonecalls to his mom. The final straw I think was on the way home he started talking about how much he wanted a coffee and started asking me to get us all coffee, although it sounded more like a demand. I was very irritable so I just agreed after my push back went nowhere, but was very short with him during the conversation until we parted ways.

My boyfriend was so much happier once we were at his place, goofing off and generally just much brighter. I asked him and he said he didn't know it just felt like he could breath again. That broke my heart. At the time I was completely used to Alex's behaviour, even if it got a little worse during the trip, but hearing my partner say that made me realize just how awful hanging out with him truely was, like walking on eggshells all the damn time. I don't hang out with him much anymore since me and my boyfriend have actually moved to the U.P. since this (yippee!!) But as far as he's aware we are still ride or die best friends. I never talked to him about his behavior but the more time that passes the more I realize that I just really don't like talking to him anymore. I don't think I'll have that talk since it will most likely end with him going silent and making Rylei respond for him as he usually does when he breaks down or gets angry (often).

So there. Thats my dirty secret. My boyfriend knows and thats it, we have lots of mutual friends and everyone thinks we're good. It's been eating me alive so im glad to finally get it out there. All questions are welcome, my memory is awful so I may have left out a few details, this is just the main points.

TL;DR: Best friend was picky, rude, and acted like a spoiled child. It made my trip awful, and he still thinks we're ""besties""",3,1742936500.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.8,False
1jju82n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jju82n,Provenance (S03E14),"*Provenance is a commonly used term in the fine arts trade which refers to the artist, place of origin, history, and chain of custody or ownership of a work of artistic significance or of great value. Documented provenance is key to determining the authenticity and value of a piece. It often becomes critical to the determination of ownership of important works of art, particularly those that were stolen or were looted during events such as World War II.*

**This episode concludes the story arc that follows Carter's death. John has returned to the team, which has rebuilt itself without her.**

The Machine monitors an art theft and a message from Alain Bouchard, Interpol agent, stating that the thief has escaped.

Returning from Italy, *new suit, new man*, Reese is informed that they have a new number: Kelli Lin, an event planner with impeccable references. Finch is able to get himself and the team into an event the new number is running at the Metropolitan Museum of History. Oh and John, you need to update your arsenal!

At the party, Shaw meets and mildly flirts with Kelli after saving the life of an investment banker from choking down some *cunning shellfish* and notes she’s good at being casually evasive. Shortly thereafter, dry ice bombs go off creating a smoke screen and a thief steals a painting. Shaw catches the thief, unmasking her: Kelli Lin, but she escapes amidst the crowd. 

Shaw steals Kelli's bag and computer and overhears Bouchard talking about the thief he has been chasing for months who kills her accomplices. John, Shaw and Finch realize that Kelli is the perpetrator, not the victim and track her to a bar called The Purloined Letter using her computer's GPS.

At the bar, Finch is able to bluejack every phone inside until he finds one that allows him to listen in on Kelli meeting with a man named Cyril who she turns the painting over to. Cyril then tells Kelli he has a last job for her, one that she has everything to gain from and alternately everything to lose. Kelli agrees to the job and leaves.

The next morning, John while walking Bear is able to follow Kelli back to her apartment. Remembering that Cyril called her Jiao, Finch does a search on the name Jiao Lin and discovers that Kelli is a former Olympic gymnast who got a silver medal at the 2000 Olympics. Harold discovers that Kelli was cut from the Chinese National Team with no given reason while preparing for the World Championships and suggests that they search her apartment for clues to what turned her into a criminal once she's away. 

That night, Shaw sneaks into Kelli's apartment and locates some clues to the plans for her next heist behind a mirror. Shaw discovers that Kelli is after the Guttenberg Bible.

Sameen is able to foil the heist and ends up in a standoff with Kelli. As they face-off with each other, Kelli gets a call from Cyril who she promises to get the Bible to and is sent a video feed of her daughter held hostage. Harold then realizes that they've made a terrible mistake.

Shaw takes a captive Kelli to Finch's safe house where he questions her. Kelli reveals that her pregnancy got her cut from the Chinese team and while desperate, she robbed a pawn shop that was a front for a criminal organization run by Cyril and his partners. They forced her to become a thief to ""pay her debt"" and kidnapped her daughter Kai to force her cooperation. Kelli is shocked to learn of the murders of her decoys, not having known what Cyril did with them. Kelli believes it to be too late to save her daughter and gives Finch the name of the company protecting the Bible, Symmetric Security Solutions. Unable to reach Kai in time to save her, Finch decides to aid Kelli, who escapes her bonds unnoticed, in stealing the Bible.

Joined by Fusco who gets them the architectural plans of the building, *yeah, he knows people*, the Team discusses the complex security systems guarding the Bible and what they need to do to bypass them.

The Team and Kelli execute their parts of the pre-stage of the heist: Fusco tips off Bouchard to Kelli's address where he runs into her outside and steals her flash drive which has her supposed plans for the theft. Bouchard reveals he knows she is the thief and believes he has her cornered, not realizing Kelli set him up. Bouchard warns Symmetric Security Solutions who moves the Bible into their central room as an additional precaution, giving Finch and Reese, who listen in on the call, the Bible's exact location. Harold determines that Cyril is likely part of a syndicate which uses Kelli to steal priceless artifacts and then sells them back to the owner and works on locating Kai. Fusco uses his status as a police officer to pull over Supervisor Farrow from Symmetric Security Solutions and lifts his fingerprints from his registration, enabling Finch to use a 3D printer to create a fake hand with Farrow's fingerprints. With their plan in place, the Team prepares to enact it.

That night, as Kelli accesses the building through the rooftop, Reese meets with Aris Zappo, claiming he has nuclear device detonators he needs transported by Symmetric Security Solutions. Reese is able to convince Zappo to take him to the building where he knocks Zappo out in the elevator and Shaw emerges from hiding inside his trunk. Reese sets off the alarms breaking into the room and is caught by security who take him to be arrested by an NYPD officer that was in the area. The officer is Fusco who Reese tells to deliver him to JFK.

Shaw and Kelli sneak into the top floor through the vents and Shaw is able to use the fingers from Finch's fake hand to access the secure room, but not before giving them a good licking to simulate the sweat needed for them tow work as advised by Harold. Kelli then uses her gymnastic abilities to swing over the electrified fence and steal the Bible while Finch raises the room's temperature to fool the infared motion sensors and loops the security camera footage. The Frenchie and Farrow detect the security breach but arrive at the secure room too late. The Bible is gone!

The next day, Finch and Shaw kidnap Bouchard at gunpoint, telling him that they borrowed the Bible for awhile. As Kelli meets with Cyril, Harold sits outside with Bouchard listening in on their conversation. Kelli turns over the Bible and demands the release of her daughter, but Cyril refuses, planning to continue to use Kai as leverage to force Keli to continue committing robberies for him. Harry tells the shocked Bouchard he needed to know the truth and the Interpol agent contacts the NYPD for backup.

Cyril calls up a video chat of Kai to remind Kelli of what's at stake only to see Reese rescuing Kai. Cyril tries to kill Kelli but is shot down by Shaw who is undercover at the bar. The NYPD arrests Cyril and Kelli and Finch informs Shaw that Kai will be brought back to the US by Reese and Finch will help her become a citizen. However, Kelli broke the law many times so her fate is in Bouchard's hands.

At the 8th precinct, Bouchard tells Kelli he can't extradite her as he wants to but he has enough on her to put her in prison for life, regardless of the circumstances and duress she was under. Bouchard admits that he always thought it was a shame she didn't win the gold as an Olympic athlete and leaves Kelli a handcuff key as he lifts his coffee cup.

Outside of her apartment, Kelli thanks Shaw for her help and wonders what to do next with her life. Shaw suggests she be a mother as Reese and Finch arrive with Kai and reunite mother and daughter.

After their successful heist and saving of Kelli and Kai, the Team celebrates in Finch's safe house, with Fusco joking around about what their next heist could be: Fort Knox or her Majesty’s jewels. During the celebration, John pours a drink for Carter, the missing member…

**Facts/Trivia**

The target of the theft is a Gutenberg Bible. The Gutenberg Bible is the first book in the western world printed with moveable type, c.1455. Although the name suggests there is only one copy, 160 to 185 copies were printed; 42 known copies survive, 21 of which are complete. Most are held in museums and libraries or at scholarly institutions worldwide, including complete copies at the Morgan Library and Museum in New York and at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

At the reception, Finch admires a codex on display. A codex is an early form of book, often illuminated, with vellum or parchment pages accordion-folded and stitched, making it possible to lay the book out as one long document when the stitching is removed.

The theft at the event was of a painting by Cézanne. Paul Cézanne was a French post-impressionist painter, known for his paintings of ordinary French life and people. He is regarded by some as the father of contemporary art.

Kelli meets Cyril at a bar called ""The Purloined Letter"", which draws its name from a short story by Edgar Allen Poe.

Cyril addresses Lin as ""miláčku,"" which means ""sweetheart"" in Czech.

Before becoming a thief, Kelli was an Olympic gymnast. During the 2000, 2004 and 2008, the Chinese gymnastics teams came under scrutiny for their use of obviously underage (under 16 years of age) girls on their team. The issue came to a head at the 2008 Beijing games. Although the International Olympic Organizing Committee and the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique investigated, and the Chinese team was exonerated, questions about the girls' ages continue to arise, largely surrounding use of falsified birth and other records used to establish the girls' ages and the admission by two members of the 2000 team that they had competed while only 14 years of age.

Agent Alain Bouchard, who follows Kelli throughout the episode, is an Interpol agent. Interpol is a non-governmental, politically neutral organization coordinating international policing, based in Lyon, France. Its work includes policing terrorism, human trafficking, crimes against humanity, organized crime, trafficking in illicit art and illicit drugs, and more. Its role is to assure mutual cooperation among policing agencies while operating within the laws of the individual countries they serve. Interpol agents cannot make arrests, but rather serve to coordinate policing among agencies, often in different countries.

The first two or three months were a real struggle. I watched all the videos and read everything I could find on reddit, but I was still having a hard time dialing in and steaming milk. I finally fixed the milk issue by continuing to practice and finally giving in and buying a one-hole tip for the steam wand. The continued practice plus the new wand tip (Ascaso 1-hole wand tip worked for me) made everything finally come together, and now I can occasionally manage some fairly acceptable latte art.

But I want to talk about dialing in and recipes. I have tried several different beans of different roast levels. Most have been local, freshly roasted. One was the Orpheo beans that came with my machine from WLL. They were not super fresh, but were good to practice on and I did get drinkable shots (though I wasn't super happy to have paid so much money on my set up just for the bare minimum of drinkability). The locally fresh roasted beans (after de-gassing, of course) were all harder to dial in. I could get a fantastic pot of coffee from them out of my cheap drip machine, but not so much with the espresso machine. Every day/week was a new experience, but none of it terribly fulfilling.

Last week I took a business trip to another city (Columbus, OH), where I visited a number of coffee shops. One of them is called One Line. I bought a latte. It was the most delectable thing I had ever had. I asked them what beans they were using (their own roast) and bought a bag (their espresso blend called ""method""). I asked for their recipe, and they gave it to me: 18.5g in, 35g out, in 28-32 seconds. But here is the thing: They were using this recipe on a custom Slayer. I tried their recipe at home, and it tasted like mud. Drinkable, but no flavor notes such as I was able to pick out from the cup they prepared for me. 

I said something about this on another post and a helpful redditor suggested I look up how to simulate a slayer shot on my Go. It involved things like temp and pressure surfing that frankly sounded like way too much of a hassle to me. I got the Profitec Go because I didn't want to do any of that stuff. But it also involved lowering the pressure to 7 or 8 bar. That was easy. I lowered my Go to 8 bar (down from 9). I tried pulling it again with that one change, and still the same muddy character. (No clarity, but drinkable.)

For fun, I decided to pull out my IMS single basket and give it a go. I know my IMS basket requires a much finer grind than the stock baskets, so I dialed it finer and figured this first one would be just a guess. I put 10 grams into my basket (rated for 12g), and pulled the shot, thinking I would try to stick with the same ratio that they coffee shop had given me. It pulled super fast. In 9 or 10 seconds it gave me 35g out. Well, I thought. That's not good. I guess I'll have to grind finer. But then I tasted it and it tasted good. I steamed my milk and poured, and it was fantastic. Maybe not 100% what I experienced at their shop, but close. And here is the thing. It comes out that way every time I use these same parameters. 

Part of me wants to try to figure out how to get a double shot rather than a single to come out just as tasty, but for now I'm just happy to know I can make myself a latte every day that I will absolutely love. To sum up, what worked with these beans in this basket with this set-up was 10g in and 35g out in 10 seconds at 8 bars of pressure in a clearly (visually) underdosed basket. 

Go figure? Moral of the story #1: stay with it, it gets better; Moral of the story #2, One Line in Ohio roasts great beans. You should visit them, or order a bag of ""method"" espresso blend from them. It's great.",8,1742936358.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I really hope someone can help me. I’m a 25-year-old male and have been dealing with anxiety-related physical symptoms for years, but something changed recently, and it’s become overwhelming.

I had my first fluttering sensation about 10 years ago during a family vacation around New Year’s. At the time, I had a heart ultrasound, EKG, and blood work—all of which came back normal.

Since then, I’ve occasionally felt palpitations or strange sensations, but it was manageable. Things took a major turn right before this New Year’s. A few days earlier, I was teaching accordion at a student’s house. That morning, I drank coffee on an empty stomach—and the fluttering hit hard. I was scared, but I powered through. Two or three days later, it got so intense I ended up in the emergency room.

Since then, it’s been happening almost every single day. I feel a weird flutter or tension in my lower stomach or chest, and my heart rate can shoot up to 140 BPM just from fear. It can happen when I lie in bed, bend forward, walk in the woods, or even when I’m just sitting alone at home. Sometimes it hits in public—like in a mall.

I’ve never fainted, never felt dizzy, and my heartbeat always seems regular—it just speeds up and pounds harder from panic.

What’s really messing with me is that I know my heart is okay. I’ve had several EKGs, blood tests, and an abdominal ultrasound (I even asked the doctor if he could see a hiatal hernia, and he said everything looked fine). Years ago, I also had a heart ultrasound. Everything keeps coming back normal.

But I’m stuck in this daily cycle of fear. I even use a stethoscope to listen to my heart whenever I lie down or feel something weird. Once, the flutter happened while I was listening—and my heart was beating completely normally. And still, the fear takes over.

It feels like I’m being tortured from the inside. Lately, I’ve even thought about going to a psych ward or back to the ER just to escape it. I’m a medical student (so I understand how the heart works), and I already deal with a lot of stress—but this is affecting my studies, my relationship, and my family. I do believe I can live a normal life again, but I just don’t know how to get there.

Last year, after moving abroad to study, I started drinking more than usual—about 3–4 beers a night to help me sleep. I’ve stopped now, but I wonder if that might have contributed to all of this. I also tend to eat a lot of takeout or order food late at night after studying—not necessarily junk food, but not the healthiest either.

I did extensive blood work after New Year’s, but I’m now considering testing for vitamin or mineral deficiencies. I’m also thinking about trying acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, or even bioresonance therapy. I’ve booked a gastroscopy soon, just to rule everything out.

As for medications, I’m currently taking:
	•	Beta-blockers (Concor Cor 1.25 mg/day)
	•	Fluoxetine/Prozac (called Fodiss here in Europe – 2x20 mg = 40 mg/day)
	•	Xanax (Hellex) as needed—usually before sleep or after waking up when it gets really bad.

I really need to know—has anyone experienced something like this? If so, how did you treat it and recover? I believe I can get back to a normal life, but right now I feel trapped, and I just want peace again.

My Mysterious Woman

I choke on the salty sea air, a bitter taste coating my tongue. Whether it be wine or the ghost of cigarette smoke, I cannot discern. Upon the narrow balcony of the hotel room, we scarcely find space to stand together, she forced to present herself at an angle. The courtyard below lies deserted. We are silent, as is my mind – a barren expanse. My hand drifts towards the glass, where only ice and a sliver of lemon remain. A wave of nausea stirs within me. I lift the glass to my lips, simply to occupy the vacant moments, to avoid gazing upon the empty bottle of cloying red wine. We have no proper goblets, nor time enough for them. I cannot recall her name, or perhaps I simply refused to commit it to memory. I care not to know her age, her patronym, or why she never deigns to tuck her hair behind her ears. Her name would be but a vessel for my indifference, a quality reflected in her moist gaze. It stifles me, and I turn away towards the restless murmur of the sea. I wish to know her not, yet am desperately pleased by her presence at my side.

The wind blows fierce and direct, and her fair, salt-tossed tendrils whip against my face. She turns swiftly, as though startled, but then manages a dry smile, and with a careless, almost abrupt gesture, gathers her hair with a damp brown band plucked from her wrist. I breathe deeply once more, thinking now solely of her plainness with her hair confined. Perhaps it is merely a trick of the light. Rays of the lamp, spilling from the room behind, fall upon her, creating the illusion that she glows. But it is naught but illusion. She wears dark spectacles, though in these Southern climes dusk descends early. Foolish girl.

I long for another cigarette; patting the pockets of my linen trousers, I realize I consumed the last but moments ago. Thus, I am left with naught but to raise my gaze once more to my brown-eyed companion. She smells of jasmine, and though I know not the precise fragrance, I am certain – it is she. Upon her long cotton dress, two dark, damp patches betray her swimsuit, stubbornly refusing to dry. The top of her white bathing costume, however, she has discarded – now draped upon the slender metal railing of my balcony, its ties fluttering listlessly in the breeze. Where the fabric is dampened, it becomes translucent, and I glimpse her youthful breasts as if she wore nothing at all.

I twitch my shoulder in disdain, wondering how to usher my companion back within the room, to enfold her in warmth, and at long last, be alone; but before I can give way to such indolent thoughts, the stranger murmurs something indistinctly, then smiles, pressing the back of her hand to her cheek, where an enchanting dimple appears. I reach once more for the glass, which remains resolutely empty. Did I strike my head today? The Devil alone knows. Quite unexpectedly, she takes my right hand, lifts it to her lips, and kisses my wrist tenderly, chirping some triviality about how she is urgently compelled to depart, presses her mouth to mine, still cool from the wind, and vanishes into the light of my room. I recover my senses only when I hear the soft click of the door, and then, moments later, catch sight of her gauzy silhouette below. She appears as a dream in the fading twilight of September. And if that be so, then in this sudden, inexplicable melancholy, I fear but one thing: awakening.

She left as I had ceased to expect her leaving, when I, myself, desired her to forsake me upon this balcony, to leave me alone with my foolish, decadent musings. I did not return her kiss. Indeed, I offered her nothing. I clench my left hand around my right, wiping away her sticky lipstick, redolent of Cabernet Sauvignon. She sailed away into oblivion. It took scarcely three minutes to realize I had not remembered her name.

I certainly struck my head, now that much is clear, as clear as the fact that grass is green; otherwise, why did I bolt into the courtyard? I thought not at all as I counted the steps she descended but moments before. Nor did I think as I stepped onto the road, to see if she lingered, awaiting…me? No, certainly not. I did not return to my room that night.

I passed the night on the hotel terrace, connected to the restaurant. Occasionally, I was roused by the clinking of glasses or bursts of laughter, but these did not stir even the faintest whisper of a thought to return to the room, where the bed remained unmade. I was more than certain that the sheet, where she had sat before rising, was crumpled; that her perfume lingered on the pillow; and that her foolish lipstick was smeared in an awkward stain upon my towel. I went straight to the shore, unwilling to endure the vulgar smiles of the hotel owners.

A cold wind blows from the sea, as it had done last night, and for a moment I fancy myself dreaming, and if I but try, I shall awaken to find her beside me. I breathe deeply, or rather, I attempt to. Perhaps I have forgotten how. The stones underfoot rustle, whether from the lapping waves or my unsteady stride. I am overwhelmed by a sudden desire to sit upon the smooth pebbles, that the indifferent sea might force me to wake. But I walk further along the shore, destroying the last vestiges of will within my heart. 

My heart stills for but a fraction of a second, enough to fall anew into infatuation, when, beyond the low bushes, I glimpse her straw hat and the dark crown of the porter’s head. Laughter cuts through the droning hum of the wind and the sea; I, covering my mouth with my hand, laugh at her latest dalliance. That which should have offended me instills the hope that beneath the silliest hat with a blue ribbon, hides her fair head.

She, it seems, stood upon tiptoe to see who had interrupted her solitude, for my stranger bestows upon me a displeased look. I smile warmly. She wears a long silk dress, which gleams and ripples in the wind, and her hair, dry and clean, is beautifully arranged beneath her hat.

“Greetings…” I long to call her by name. But yesterday I cared not to know it. Today I would surrender my own for but the first letter.

She coughs softly, turning forcibly toward her latest cavalier, and, casting upon him a bored glance, emerges from behind the green fence:

“Greetings.”

She gazes at me directly and without embarrassment, which banishes any inclination to laugh. Yesterday’s tenderness overthrown by wounded pride. — Shall we walk?

I see confusion, a shadow upon her young face, so, without hesitation, I offer her my hand before I have time to regret it.

“What did you want?”

I stifle a smile once more, feeling her grasp the hand she accepted more firmly:

“Oh, a trifle. You wouldn’t believe it,” I leap onto the small steps of the cafe, hoping she will follow, “To spend time with you. Not in the bushes, nor in the bedroom.”

She tilts her head with a semblance of offense, not taking her eyes from my shirt. She is enchanting, and I do not allow myself to touch her face. We go inside, when her dry words encroach upon the acquired serenity:

“Did you not find it to your liking, then?”

She sits upon a chair opposite mine, we settle at a table by the window. One sees the sea and the sky, and I understand how much her fresh face triumphs over this dreary landscape. I ignore her question.

She props her chin upon her palm, clinging to every feature of my face with her gaze. Her simplicity crowns a living beauty. My stranger removes her hat, places it on the chair beside her. She gazes into mine, and I cannot withstand her honesty, so I summon the waitress and place an order for two.

We are silent, as if this were all. As if she shall now depart from the table, forgetting her hat and not glancing at me, and I, turning towards the window, shall think of tomorrow’s train home. But this is merely “as if,” for within twenty minutes, her crepes and a cup of strong coffee for myself will arrive. I shall certainly learn which harmonious sound has become her name. Then we shall venture forth to the shore, where a strong sea wind still blows, and walk to my hotel, where the light has burned since the evening before and the bed is disarrayed, and we shall sit upon the narrow balcony, pressing our knees together, and sit until midnight, because she possesses a white bathing costume and idiotic spectacles. And also because I have fallen in love.",0,1742936154.0,translator,2,0.33,False

You hear so many languages from around the world and have access to an incredible mix of restaurants, coffee shops, and even bakeries.

I have such fond memories of growing up in Maryland. For nearly 18 years, my dad and I went to the same Vietnamese barbershop. We used to buy fish from a Korean superstore in Silver Spring, MD, and on his way back from work, my dad would sometimes stop by our favorite Iranian bakery to grab some sweets. (My favorite was a little cake topped with fruit and jello, layered with delicate white cream and soft bread.)

I also played a lot of pickup soccer and picked up some Spanish slang along the way. Now that I’m 30, I’ve grown to appreciate all of this so much more. The DMV is more diverse than ever, and being part of such a rich cultural environment has played a huge role in my growth and worldview.

If you’re looking for an inclusive, diverse place to live—especially if you have kids—I highly recommend considering the DC area. It’s truly special.",24,1742935490.0,SameGrassButGreener,5,0.96,False

1jjtrt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/demisexuality/comments/1jjtrt4/innitial_attractionmeeting_ppl_irl/,Innitial attraction/meeting ppl irl,"So to start off- I'm somewhere in the demi spectrum but idk the word for it and I'm kind of nervous posting here but I feel like this aspect is something ppl night be able to relate to and offer some insight 

  
I'm 31 nb, autistic, and have for the most part met ppl thru apps. It's turned out that I'm MUCH more attracted to ppl's insides and brains and hearts than their outsides. There are a few external things that are important to me but not much. I am really mindful abt how ppl dress, not in a judgy way, but in a ""that says a lot abt how a person expresses themselves"" way. 



W the apps- you get a bio, you can learn a little abt ppl before trying to match/message (depends on the format of the app). I'm enbie 4 enbie and only want to date other ppl who are DEEPLY passionate abt a creative craft- primarily musicians but I've crushed on some tattoo artist too (I do both visual art and music,) and connecting on that stuff is so paramount (for me) in establishing intimacy and closeness in romantic connections. Also autistic4 autistic. And they gotta have a BIG WEIRD personality. Like I'm pretty specific in what I'm looking for (have branched out and have had connections w ppl who aren't quite what I've hoped and they were nice experiences, but it felt like something was missing, like a lack of depth to the connections. I've also gotten a little broader in some of the things I'm open to/looking for. So all this is to say I've really worked on not limiting myself to a box- I'm just VVVVVVV decisive in what's attractive to me and know what I want)

  
In real life- say for example hanging out at a coffee shop or a bar- and for the sake of conversation- there's no event that night. You don't know anything abt anyone. I know for a lot of ppl- the thing that makes them want to go chat up someone is that they find the other person cute....but it's not super often I just see someone and go ""yeah they're hot""- and I've learned that the ppl who catch my eye that way tend to not be the kinds of personalities I'm looking for. 

  
For a multitude of reasons I do not- date coworkers or go to any kind of mertup groups/group sports/anything of that nature. My hobbies are all either solo things or stuff I only feel comfortable doing w friends. I go to shows sometimes- but get so overestimated/anxious around crowds that those aren't great places for me to meet ppl (except smoking outside after a few drinks and ppl start talking to me.) (I'm also the kind of person who, at a party where i dont know a lot of ppl- will go sit on the patio most the night and wait for ppl to filter out and a lot of the time that turned into heart to hearts and make ""party besties"" and then when I've gotten to know more ppl one on one, will go back into the party)

  
All of this is to say- I'm outgoing and bubbly but ALSO shy and p risk adverse at times so I reeeeeeally don't want to have to just chat up everyone at the place in hopes of meeting the right ppl. I'm aware that might wind up being what ppl suggest, but I thought I'd ask and see if anyone had any tips- possibly how to ppl watch and read a room w/out being weird abt it, possibly how to dress/act/exist in ways that could get more ppl to talk to me? I'm really open to whatever you've got. ",2,1742935335.0,demisexuality,0,1.0,False

A little background: 35 yr old male, been drinking caffeine since 6th grade in the form of coffee, pre workouts and sugar free energy drinks. Have had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but been able to cope and build a life. 18 months ago I was able to sober up. Drinking alcohol since 12th grade. A few years ago I finally acknowledged I was drinking to escape my thoughts and feelings. So in my mind, I had a problem. I would basically drink Friday, Saturday and Sunday, specifically to numb my feelings. As soon as my wife found out she was pregnant, I was somehow able to fully stop and never once tempted ever since. God saved me. Well, my emotions were still there, so caffeine was my next drug of choice. For the last year and a half I’ve consumed at minimum 400mg of caffeine every single day. I’ve tried many many many many times in the past to quit. Every time is life changing but short lived. I’m calmer, happier, more clear, etc. so here I am on day 3. This time, for the first time, no alcohol and caffeine. Just my raw raw RAW emotions. It’s like tug of war trying to convince myself not to get a Celsius. Trying to battle through this but I just feel so depressed. I own a business and have a 16 month at home. Trying to do it all right now. It’s just so hard.

I am a regional employee and the office I report to is in the second worst crime neighborhood in my city. Since I’ve worked here I’ve experienced a substantial increase in unpleasant interactions with members of the public in the area surrounding the office. Last week a woman threatened to kill me and then proceeded to assault another member of the public less than a foot away from me. I have reported this incident to my security officer however the stance has been that they are not responsible for employee safety until I am on the premises and these events are happening while I’m walking to my car or getting a coffee. With RTO 3 days a week the risk of experiencing violence has gone up a ton and my city does not have any GC coworking spaces so this is the only office I can report to. I feel like someone is going to have to get hurt before anything will be done and im experiencing anxiety every time I have to go into the office. My manager just referred me to EAP which doesn’t help the circumstances and I’m feeling really discouraged. Does anyone have a similar experience and has a workaround ever been provided to you?

I had met someone at a side job and had gotten to know him, I thought we clicked and I decided to ask him out for coffee. He said yes but we never actually went then when I saw him afterwards he told me he was going through a lot. I just continued talking to him at work (we work in different departments) then a few weeks ago, we began texting back and forth consistently for a few weeks then it stopped where he was sending me songs and just chatting about life and all. He had told me work was stressful and a lot and I was trying to give space and not needy.

He had said we should play games together and we set a day for that but then I texted him to ask him and he never replied and left me hanging. 

A week or so ago, I did call him out that he didn’t text me back and he said he just wanted to be friends for now. I played it off cool and didn’t confirm or deny that I liked him.

I’ve been okay keeping myself busy up until today. I’m feeling sad and down and like I did something. Maybe it’s the wrong timing? Anyways, anyone have any recommendations for moving on? I’d like to be friends with him and get that he might or isn’t interested and that is maybe what is setting in.

Oddly enough, over the past few weeks, I’ve been getting closer to his sister but I genuinely like her and see her as my little sister.

Other things that might be relevant is that over the last year, I had WLS so I went from 300lbs to now being 177lbs and still loosing. Not sure if relevant but adding this too.

i fell into a routine that both calmed and disgusted myself. i’d wake up late, rush getting up (hopefully at least running a brush through my hair), run to corbett, grab a coffee, run to lecture. whether or not i slept through this morning lecture was largely dependent on what i’d been up to the night before and whether i’d just gotten in trouble for sleeping in lecture. at lunch, i usually grabbed something as fast as possible, then went back to domenici to wait for afternoon lecture. initially, i’d hang out with my peers for lunch, but this became increasingly stressful knowing they didn’t want me there. afternoon lecture tended to be easier to get through, this was often when my note-taking skills would finally kick in. i got sleepier, though, when i started sitting in the back to let a couple of kids sit by each other. it was fine, i looked forward to the reward every day of lecture being over. 

at 4:00, i’d walk back to the dorms, usually alone. then, one of the favorite times of my day would begin. alone in my room, i would complete the next problem set, shower, and get dressed nicely, before making my way over to corbett for dinner. i actually really liked dinner when i was seated with a ta. afterwards, i’d usually go back to pinon, sometimes going back to domenici if i had finished the pset. otherwise, i’d rot in my dorm room, working more if necessary, cleaning, and pacing around listening to music. i’d often pace around the dorm, too, the warm weather was pleasant by that time. as it got later, i’d go to turn in my problem set, usually alone. then came the least lonely part of my day

july fifteenth, about midway or two-thirds way through the program, i arrived around twenty minutes late to morning lecture. this was fine. what wasn’t fine, though, was that when i tried to compensate for the missed sleep from the night before, i slept through the 7:00 pm dorm meeting. i arrived and walked over to my tas. i was feeling nauseous, but not that bad. i made eye contact with the site director and broke down crying. i hate feeling like people are disappointed in me. i think that this was the moment when i started to believe i really didn’t belong there. i attempted suicide twice during the program. 

i do want to briefly note how much i adored the tas. i felt so comfortable with all of them, like they genuinely cared about me. i’ll have to give it to ssp international–they picked a good four. one ta somewhat stood out to me. they felt like a mentor. they said one thing in particular though–you don’t marry your high school sweetheart, you don’t do this, you don’t do that. you don’t die on all those hills. “i tried to die on a lot of hills,” they said. i don’t think that this was their intention, but i’ve felt so much less attached to things since. maybe not in a good way

NO JUDGEMENT!! I’m really just extra curious lol I could not fathom liking being pregnant except for feeling my baby in me and the bonding. 
For reference I had HG and probably gestational diabetes with my first son. I as in and out of the hospital, zofran stopped working, then I was on phenergan for the rest of the time. He was born 4 weeks early and had a stint in the NICU. That was pretty hard but he’s cool now! With my current pregnancy I was still pretty sick. I take unisom (4x daily) and b6 (2x daily). Prenatal make me very ill. My gd number were so high they think I had diabetes “a little bit” before I got pregnant (whatever that means). Neither pregnancy I can eat spaghetti, pizza, or lasagna.

Yes, that's my salary as an industrial engineer in Morocco. Been working for almost two years; I never saved anything because of gambling. It was not just the money, but also the time and the stress. My family is so poor, and yet I dragged my father into this (I provide a little at home before losing it all). I once borrowed from my father, and I'm still paying him back (he doesn't know the real reason). I blame myself every day.​

After one month of reasoning that I was just chasing losses and that what's gone is gone, yesterday I thought I should've saved at least a decent amount by now. I wanted to buy a gaming chair, an air conditioner, and what I had in my account was 600 USD. It was not enough for me. I installed the gambling app again, kept telling myself to just go to sleep, that I won't win anything, and yet, knowing that I'm going to lose, I hoped for that 100 USD to turn into 1,000 USD. It didn't happen. I swear to you guys, it was not the rush; I felt nothing, just emptiness clicking, knowing what was going to happen at the end. Why I did it? I don't know.​

I confronted my brother, and he told me he's not going to talk to me again. I felt him; why would he? I wouldn't talk to myself either. I'm going to disappear for the next month, not going out, even to coffee shops with friends, just to fix a little bit of my account. I'll be living every day empty because I have to, to pay back my father and provide him with more. My friends will suspect my behavior of not going back, but it's okay; they already noticed how my life has not changed a lot since I started working. I don't want to live, and yet I have to.​

Please, if anyone can relate to me, I just need one answer to one question: How can I keep up with my life? Will it ever be normal again? Will I ever be living comfortably?",1,1742934198.0,depression,1,1.0,False

A few days later, it asked me to submit POA (because the value of the item exceeded the... amount that I wasn't told), and a proof of EIN/SSN.

Submitted the POA and the proof, fast forward a couple days after, I got a notice about having to pay import duty payment - for 519.82 USD.

Thought this was odd, because of KORUS FTA that exempts such duty fee/fines. So I checked in with a DHL agent, and asked for an itemized invoice. There were two copies of it, first one stating 354.72 USD, and the second one stating 0.00 USD. (two copies were identical everywhere else, all the fields except amounts).

Sent another email, requesting an explanation for the difference. Then the fee was lowered to 197.71 USD, and was sent a screenshot - there were four categories.

1. Merchandise Processing Fee
2. Advanced Fee-Broker Fee
3. Obtain Permit and License
4. Single Transaction Bond

I understand that by submitting a Power of Attorney (POA), I authorized DHL to act as my broker. However, I did not request or pre-approve the securing of a Single Transaction Bond, nor was I informed in advance that my package being randomly selected for inspection would trigger such fees.

AFAIK, a coffee grinder does not require any special permits or licensing.

The Single Transaction Bond fee was applied solely due to the random check.

And the Advance Fee just appears to be a generic broker fee - I did not request additional brokerage services beyond the standard customs clearance.

And that was the end of the communication - didn't hear back, but only to notice that the fee went down to 148 USD - which still contained Permit and License fee, and Single Transaction Bond.",1,1742934150.0,dhl,1,1.0,False

Ingredients:
	•	114 mL Fairlife® Fat-Free Milk
	•	45 mL Sugar-Free French Vanilla Coffee Creamer or 4-8g Vanilla Extract and 4-8g Stevia
	•	46 g (approximately 1½ scoops) PE Science® Gourmet Vanilla Protein Powder
	•	9 g Vanilla Jell-O® Instant Pudding Mix
	•	Pinch of Sea Salt

Instructions:
	1.	In a Ninja Creami pint container, add the ingredients in the following order:
a. Fairlife® milk
b. Coffee creamer (and/or vanilla extract)
c. Protein powder, pudding mix, and sea salt
	2.	Use a hand mixer or electric whisk to mix the contents thoroughly for at least 1 minute. This helps activate the pudding mix and ensures a smooth base.
	3.	Freeze the pint for a full 24 hours.
	4.	When ready to serve, remove the pint from the freezer and run it under very hot water until the sides begin to loosen from the container.
	5.	Place the pint in the Ninja Creami and spin on the Light Ice Cream setting.
	6.	After the first spin, remove the pint and use a large, heavy spoon to press and compress the mixture down firmly.
	7.	Return to the Ninja Creami and re-spin.
	8.	If the texture is still powdery or snow-like, repeat the pressing and re-spin once more.
	9.	For a softer consistency, perform an additional re-spin as desired.

So, I am a transgender woman who has been in active transition for about half a decade. I was blessed to have an incredibly supportive friend group, but my family? Not so much. My grandmother was incredibly opposed to my transition (I was raised by her), and even once threatened to kick me out of the house if I went through with it (was living with her at the time).

This has, for the most part, settled into a somewhat shaky ""tolerance"" where she doesn't really bring it up, and tbh I'm perfectly okay with that. But, things came back to a head last week when we were talking over cake & coffee, specifically because I let her know that I filed the petition for a change of names. Naturally, I told her the new full name I was taking, and she flipped out when I mentioned my new last name. She immediately started asking what my problem was with the ""family name"". I politely explained that I wanted something that sounds better with my full name. She then tried to make me change my mind because ""your name is on my will and I'm not paying a lawyer to change my will again"". I refused. She then tried to say that it was an insult directed at the family and was ""disrespectful"". Being fed up with the back j forth, I set it out in plain English that my decision is final, that she has no say in what I do with my name, and to drop the issue. I left after she said her typical passive-aggressive line of ""I don't care, do what you want. You always do what you want anyway"", to which I replied with a cheerful ""thank you, I will!""

Shortly afterwards, I started getting phone calls and texts from others in my family saying I was an asshole for refusing to ""see her side"", and that I was wrong to change my last name... the more aggressive & old school relatives also used this as an opportunity to tell me they were disappointed for my ""lifestyle choices"", and that I would always be (deadname) to them, whether I liked it or not.

The problem is 99% of the time they, don't know how or think its not possible. (Including corporates locations) The employee who did it for me last time moved and no longer works there. So next time I encounter this, I would love to know what to say to them to make it work. Anyone know?

( The reason I want to do this,  is because store cards can not be added to your mobile account by the customer so I cant mobile order with it, it has to be done in person on the register, hence why I want to just add it to my mobile account gift card balance so I cant just mobile order with it even if its not a big deal, I would like to know how you do it if any baristas  here have an idea? )  Thanks!

**Java Burn Reviews: Real Talk Time** Alright, so I was skeptical at first, as we all are with these things, right? But after diving into Java Burn reviews, especially on consumer reports, I thought, Why not give it a shot?

**Java Burn Coffee: Elevating My Cup of Joe** So, what's the deal with Java Burn coffee? It's this dissolvable, tasteless packet you throw into your coffee, and bam, you've got this upgraded brew that's supposed to boost metabolism and energy. Intriguing, right?

**Java Burn Ingredients: Nature's Squad Goals** I did my homework on the ingredients – all-natural, vegetarian, gluten-free, and non-GMO. It's got this powerhouse combo that's supposed to set your metabolism on fire. Sounds like my kind of science!

**What is Java Burn? Unveiling the Magic** Java Burn is essentially this mix designed to amp up your metabolism when combined with coffee. It claims to torch fat, reduce hunger, and improve overall health. Bold promises, I know.

**Does Java Burn Work? My Experience** Okay, the million-dollar question. Does Java Burn actually work? For me, I'd say yes. I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.

**Java Burn Complaints: Separating Fact from Fiction** Let's address the elephant in the room – complaints. I've seen some gripes, but honestly, most seem like folks not giving it enough time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a supercharged metabolism.

**Java Burn Scam: Let's Bust Some Myths** Scam or not? I did my digging, and I'm leaning towards not. I mean, I got what I paid for, and my coffee's never been this exciting.

**Reviews on Java Burn: Diverse Perspectives** I don't want you to just take my word for it. Dive into other Java Burn reviews for a broader picture. People's experiences vary, and it's good to get different perspectives.

**Is Java Burn a Scam? Spoiler Alert: Nah** With all the noise about scams, I get the hesitation. But from where I'm standing, Java Burn's delivering the goods without any shadiness.

**Java Burn Coffee Buy Online: My Go-To Move** Ordered mine online – smooth process. Amazon's got it, and it's a convenient way to get your hands on Java Burn without much fuss.

1jjszqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1jjszqt/misc_marathon_questions/,Misc Marathon Questions,"I got a few random questions regarding my marathon this weekend. I’m a 220lb runner going for sub 3:20 (not sure if that matters but thought I would include). it’s my first marathon

Plan on eating a huma plus gel every five miles and a saltstick fastchew every 8 miles. is that enough?

Marathon starts at 7:30am. plan on waking up at 4:30am to eat a bagel with some pb and honey, and drink coffee to clear my system. please critique my plan for race day morning.

Can i run without my shirt on? might be a stupid question but i’m in Texas and it’s warm. would i pin my bib to my shorts?

should i drink water every time I see an aid station or is there a better methodology?

any tips on congestion? last few weeks I’ve been having to farmers blow all over the place cause my nose has been stuffy. would prefer not to have to do that during the race

add any other tips too - thanks
