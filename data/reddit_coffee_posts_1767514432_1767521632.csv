1q3md52,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarchSolution/comments/1q3md52/questions/,Questions,"Hello
I’ve recently started following this diet, but not completely. 
I do eat meat / poultry once a week and fish once a week. 
I add milk to my coffee and occasionally eat cheese. 
The general feeling is that this is the real thing, I feel great generally and clothes became looser recently. 
I have at least 40 kg to lose. 
I have few questions:
1. From time to time I feel anxiety after eating. It happened mostly on lunch in which I have a salad of tomatoes cucumbers lettuce red pepper and bread crumbs, adding a teaspoon of olive oil, salt and organic apple cider vinegar. 
On top of the salad I eat potatoes and/or rice and some steamed veggies. 
The anxiety also happened yesterday after having two cups of coffee plus 2 small to moderate sized pastries. 
What can cause this anxiety?
2. Regarding weight loss, to set expectations, how and when should I expect the scale to drop? I mean I do feel great, clothes really feel looser but the scales are ruining the celebration.

Thank you for this community, I got to know this program thanks to it and I do feel lucky.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

I’m not sure how to go about making her feel better?,"So you need context. When I met my girlfriend, it was from a friend of a friend. So we didn’t really become friends for a while. But we’d regularly see each other at places where our friends wanted to hang. So slowly we got used to eachother. Eventually we got closer and we didn’t sleep together, nor did we kiss. Nothing of the sort. I just happened to sleep on her couch. And her and my friends had already left. She made me a coffee. 
Now I don’t like coffee. But for some reason. Seeing that she made me a coffee I drank it for her. I did not like it, but I liked the gesture. We talked and eventually exchanged numbers. Friends sorta now. We still didn’t hang properly yet but eventually me and my friends were at her house in the morning and she made me a coffee after everyone said no. Didn’t even ask me. But I drank it anyway. Didn’t like it but again liked that she made it.

Then we… I don’t know how but ended up going for coffee together. She ordered a coffee for me before I arrived. It was awful but I drank it anyway. Now we were closer, she would make me coffee more often, honestly felt like a love language to be honest. Years pass and… this is the bad part. I’m at a friends house and without thinking about the fact my girlfriend is on the couch. He asks if I want a coffee and I say verbatim “god no, coffee is so shit, I only drink water, juice or milkshakes. Coffee is bitter”
I laugh before getting a juice, but then I turn and she’s just staring at me like something cracked in her.  

We get home and the next day I get no morning coffee from her… it feels bad not getting it even though it taste bad, I honestly liked her making me coffee. She’s left for work earlier than usual and left a note. Not a text for some reason? But she said “I’ll be home late tonight.”
No I love you, no morning kisses, nothing. It was all a shock. 
I’ve just gotten home from work and she’s not home. It feels wrong because she’s usually home before me.

TLDR: Girlfriend got into habit of getting me coffee without asking me, even before we were together. Then made it every morning. She heard me say I didn’t like coffee and now she’s left early for work and didn’t make coffee or say goodbye. She left a note saying she’d be home late",0,1767520863.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

1q3m48p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3m48p,Andaman Solo Trip Story - As a female traveller (Part 3),"This is the 3rd and final part of my Andaman story as a female solo traveller.

After snorkelling on 2nd Jan, I took the ferry from Neil island and in the journey, lost my left earphone as I slept listening to music and left the ferry without checking😭

I reached the Reef Atlantis hotel (also had a bar) from jetty (200rs) and the rickshaw auto guy didn’t ask me any questions and felt safe. I also got the number of the rickshaw person as I had my flight at 9 am the next day and I didn’t want to panic at last moment without auto to get to the airport. When I checked into the hotel, the receptionist guy also didn’t ask any questions. This was the only hotel in which I felt completely safe. Maybe because it was in the middle of the city and the others were resorts in beaches (looking back now, even those feel safe except for the questions by the receptionist). I rented a scooty from them (Advance 2000 and rent is 600). The couple I met in Neil island gave me a contact for parasailing. It costed 3000 rs in the water sports complex. The guy told me it is 3000 for parasailing and if we want photos and videos, we have to pay separately in the boat (500rs). So, I boarded the boat and I was the only person there. I also paid the people in the boat 500 rs for video and he gave me the 360 degree camera. He told me I’ll only get the video by 9pm today as they have to edit it before sharing and also gave me his number to call him in case I didn’t get the videos. I did parasailing and it was an amazing experience! I came out and received the video 2 days later. Another memorable experience in Andaman!

After Parasailing, I took the scooty to Corbyn’s cove beach. The roads are not good (because of construction) but the view of the sea is lovely. I wanted to stop at tiranga point, but there were a group of men there, so I went to beach directly. In the beach, I ordered a small fish, which the shopkeeper said would have 4 pieces but he ended up serving me a bunch of silver fish for 200 rs which was not worth it. When I went told him I don’t want this, he was rude saying he won’t change the order and I also ordered a mojito which was not good (water wasn’t clean and it had ants) for which he charged me 150rs. Usually I am a person who would go back and fight for replacement or refund for a food like this, but I decided to bear with the mojito (Maybe because I was alone and didn’t want any problems). The food on total was not worth it. 

It was almost evening (4pm)  when I was returning back, there was a Nescafe in the middle of the way to tiranga point, I packed some pasta there and had coffee enjoying the marine view. But there was a lot of dust (due to the roads) and I don’t recommend eating outside. And it was the perfect time when I reached the Tiranga point, around 4:30pm for sunset. The view, the water and the winds🤍 I enjoyed the whole sunset. I was thinking how brave I have been all along and pulled off this trip. Because I have thought for a thousand times to cancel everything and stay home with friends and family for New Years, but I took the leap of faith and did this! And it was the most memorable new year gift I gave to myself. For the first time in 3 days, I wanted to let my guard down and enjoy it completely. I put on my right earphone (🥲) and started listening and vibing to the music. Hopped and danced a bit on my way to scooty! Wanted to stay a bit longer, but had to return to hotel to use the restroom. Again, the restroom opposite to tiranga point was not good and the lock wasn’t working too. Is it too much to expect clean public toilets in India?

Came to hotel freshened up and visited cellular jail. It was dark by then and there were bunch of men outside cellular jail (Maybe the people working there and the tourist agencies). I approached them to ask how to book ticket, they said it has to be booked online and I won’t get the tickets at all for the next show (7:30pm) and have to wait till 8:30pm. But then I approached a family who was standing nearby and they helped me book tickets for 7:30 show (you need to register yourself in the official website and select the slot and make online payment, it was quite easy). I was skeptical to book the Hindi show but the lady in the family assured me the show won’t be in complete Hindi because then the audience won’t understand the show. I went ahead and booked the Hindi show(I had no choice also because the remaining slots were only Hindi). The wife was a history teacher and she had planned the whole trip for her family too. I must say, they were the first family I saw who had come to Andaman without booking any tourist package. She was very surprised to know that I was solo travelling and she motivated me. When I went inside for the show to start, the people working there showed me my seat and were asking whether I was alone or with family. Again, I had to lie my family is seated behind 🥲. The cellular jail lights and sound show was very good and moving (no photos or videos allowed, but I saw a couple of people taking videos). But the show was in proper Hindi (with no English words) and I could only understand half of the show🥲 But there is also an English show at 6:30pm, just letting you all know.

After the show, I had texted the couple I met in Neil Island (30F and 28M, just realised I didn’t mention it earlier) to meet for dinner. They were in the cornyb cove’s beach and asked me to join there. But afraid of the roads, I didn’t want to ride alone in the dark, so I asked whether the can join me here. They were understanding and they came in another scooty to see me in cellular jail and we went to their hotel (Hote Driftwood) for dinner as their package had dinner included. I ordered the veg red sauce spaghetti (costed 350rs). The rooftop restaurant was good with a good view and bit chilly! The food in their package was good but the restaurant food I ordered was too sweet and not worth it. I spent really good time with the couple. They were so nice and we were talking about our work and family. They made me feel very safe and comfortable. The girl motivated me to do more trips in my 20s (she also solo travelled a lot)! They seemed to have a very understanding relationship and gave each other their own space, which was a very nice thing to see after my breakup. It made me feel I took the right decision of getting out of the relationship because I don’t want to settle for less. The girl also told me that I should not hesitate to date more in my 20s as it will make me understand what type of guy I want. This came across as a really eye opening thought as I have been always a person who never wanted to try and experiment with relationships because I was too afraid of ending up getting hurt. But then she told me her stories and how she eventually found of her guy. And they even came back to drop me in my hotel around 11 pm. Moments like this make the solo trips worthy! 

The next day, I boarded my flight back to Chennai and the entire time in flight I spent writing this post. Looking back, if you ask me whether it was worth it- hell, yeah! The Sloppy plannings, silly mistakes, last minute decisions and the moments I felt scared and insecure, they all taught me new things and it added more depth to my character. The whole learning of this journey cannot be put into words, it has to be experienced. And I’m so proud of myself for handling all the situations well and following my gut instinct always (your gut instinct will never fail you). 

A lot of people around (your parents, relatives and sometimes your friends) will tell you not to go alone on trips and that is because they care about your safety. But, there are also many good people in this society who will help you to navigate and handle it. Next time you see someone solo travelling somewhere or even in your own city, try to help them in any small way possible and make them feel comfortable, because I believe that’s how we build a good and safe society. 

I’m happy I started my new year like this! So, To all my girlies out there, just do it. For yourself. Because, if you never experience it, you’ll never know the feeling! “Oops is always better than what if”. 

You can always start with a place nearby and, with more experience, slowly explore places farther from home. Believe me, it’s never about the destination, it’s always about the journey🤍

And even if things don’t go as planned, at least you’ll walk away with no regrets, only lessons. Just make sure you stay safe, share your live location and carry a pepper spray (if you’re not flying, because apparently they aren’t allowed on flights😬, something I discovered on this trip too).",5,1767520444.0,Andaman_and_Nicobar,1,1.0,False

We’re looking for very basic camping gear (flexible on everything):
2× camping chairs
2× sleeping mats / air mattresses
1× small camping table
1× basic camp stove + simple cookware / cutlery

We’re happy to:
Pay a small rental fee / beer money / coffee
Pick up and return everything in Perth
Take good care of the equipment

If lending isn’t an option, we’d also appreciate tips on cheap second-hand gear or places where travellers usually pass things on.

I am a 19 year old female introvert looking to meet another introvert who understands the value of quiet moments, deep conversations over small talk, and spending time together without needing constant activity or crowds.

I spend most of my time reading books, listening to music with headphones on, watching movies or series at home, journaling, taking long walks alone, or just enjoying my own company in cozy spaces. Big parties, loud bars, and crowded events drain me completely, so I prefer low-key dates like coffee in a quiet cafe, browsing a bookstore together, cooking a meal at home, or simply sitting side by side while we each do our own thing.

I am hoping to find someone who feels the same way, someone who recharges in solitude but still wants a meaningful romantic connection with one person they can open up to gradually. I like the idea of building trust slowly through messages first, then maybe voice notes or calls when we are both comfortable, and eventually meeting in person when it feels right.

A bit more about me: I am shy at first but warm up a lot once I feel safe. I value honesty, kindness, and respect for personal space. I am not into hookup culture or anything rushed. I would rather take months to get to know someone deeply than jump into something superficial.

If you are an introverted guy around my age who prefers staying in on weekends, enjoys thoughtful conversations about life, books, dreams, or random ideas, and wants a relationship that grows quietly and naturally, please send me a message. Tell me a little about yourself, what you like to do when you are alone, and why you are here looking for the same kind of connection.

1q3ly4x,https://i.redd.it/jky25iq1zabg1.jpeg,The Last Tea Shop - First solo RPG experience,"I started **The Last Tea Shop** two weeks ago and finished the first playthrough today. I made some tea (coffee today, I hope I can be forgiven), lit a scented candle, put on calm music, grabbed my journal and started writing.

Even just describing my tea shop in detail was a lot of fun and the conversations with the visitors mostly flowed naturally, which was unexpected. I must admit I re-rolled some questions for some of the later visitors, so as to not repeat the same questions (although I know that different visitors would have given different answers) and because for some I already had ideas in mind as to where I wanted the conversation to go.

I met the Farmer, Tailor, Herbalist, Nun, Noble, and Princess, so this felt like a very basic playthrough considering the ways the path can diverge, or what kinds of ingredients you can get. For me that’s perfect for a first playthrough - This way I feel like I still have so much more to discover!

I was a little unsure about the Veiled One at first, as there’s no additional information about this character, which I’m sure is done on purpose to leave some creative freedom, so they became a mysterious visitor who sees and knows more than others, so they did not talk about themselves, but about the previous visitors *and* the shopkeeper, for a small change of perspective.

I drew a lot of inspiration from one of my D&D characters who is a Grave Cleric, so death and the beyond are important themes for them, and some of the visitors’ responses were in some way thematically linked to this character’s personality or background, which made this experience not only easier but also more profound for me personally.

My first playthrough took four sessions: I wrote roughly 1,000 words during the first one - by hand, which I wasn’t used to anymore, so this was a fun change to my usual writing habits. (Also writing in English, why I don’t usually do as it’s not my first language.) In total I wrote about 2,200 words (I like to count words a part of keeping track of my writing habit), and am curious to see what the next playthroughs will bring! All in all this was a fun and at times even emotionall experience, so I'm super happy to have discovered **The Last Tea Shop** and decided to give it a try (finally, more than a month after buying it)!

I’ll also explore other solo RPGs soon. I have a long list of adventures/systems I want to try, I just have to decide which one will be most suited as my next writing exercise.",4,1767519819.0,solorpgplay,1,1.0,False

Tried tracking on MyFitnessPal again yesterday and almost immediately felt miserable. Just as I had the umpteen times I’d tried it before.

Decided to jettison that and try intermittent fasting.

I’d got down to 194 lb in summer, largely through walking a lot and having breakfast very late…it was essentially intermittent fasting that I was doing, but I hadn’t been systematic about it.

I decided to approach intermittent fasting with some discipline. I began my fast on 3rd Jan at 7.45 pm. 

For strength and cardiovascular fitness, I’m going to do a resistance bands workout every other day, alternating the workouts with running. I’ll add some dumbbell and barbell work to the workout days as I make progress.

My goal weight is 165 lb. I’d like to reach that by summer. If I lose 1.5 lb per week on average, I’ll be down to my goal weight about three weeks after the summer solstice. It seems reasonable, so here goes.

I’m determined to make this happen. I’ve struggled with my weight for a few years now, having been on an antidepressant that caused my appetite to run wild (I also developed a sweet tooth that I hadn’t had prior to going on that medication). I changed to a different medication a year ago and the bingeing stopped.

Coming up to 14 hours in. I’ve had black coffee and water this morning, but nothing else, of course. Aiming for 16 hours but I’ll see how long I can manage before I feel properly hungry…",3,1767519758.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.8,False

As most of the comments suggested water was the issue. I got myself some water(Volvic) and this didn't appear to change anything. At least didn't change the problem i was having on a greater scale.

So then, leaving only grind and coffee taste to be the problem I thought the next step was to rule these out... Since i liked the espresso you can get from costa(yeah i know, sue me) I picked up some beans from the super market just to taste.

Using the costa beans, i could taste the notes that i liked, but these notes were still behind the strong sour/bitter taste that i still couldn't get rid of. So now i have beans i know i like but still cant get good output.

Next step. Try some pre ground coffee, purchased some pre ground for espresso from the super market, came out good. Not to my taste, but the bitter/sour was so much better. The puck was smoother than my self ground pucks.

So then a decision. Fuck it. Yesterday my DF64 arrived.

Got myself some cheap beans to throw through it to get used to it before using my good beans. Even these cheap beans were better than all my previous pulls.

Finally did it, put some good beans in and honestly before now i thought the ""notes"" where just a thing only people who've been doing it ages can taste, holy shit my coffee actually has the depicted notes of peach, cherry and chocolate, it smells fruity but the taste is actually good and not punching me in the throat? Even as a latte i can taste the fruity notes.

Now the real journey begins.

I’m currently working on a new food brand. I’ve identified a specific gap in our street food scene for something that is massive in other parts of the world but hasn't really hit Ahmedabad yet.
I’m looking for a partner to jump in with me. I’m handling the business, branding, and back-end, but I need a co-founder who actually loves being in the kitchen. You’ll be the ""face"" of the food working from the stall/truck, perfecting the taste, and making sure the quality is top-tier, at least until we have perfected our SOPs and training.

The Deal:

I’m looking for someone who is ready to put some skin in the game. I’m valuing the initial investment at around 10 Lakhs including everything.

• I’m looking for a partner to bring in 4 Lakhs for a 40% stake. * I’ll be putting in 6 Lakhs for 60%.

Note: If you are the perfect fit but don't quite have the funds, I am open to funding the full amount myself. However, I’m prioritizing someone who can invest, simply because I want a partner who is just as committed as I am.

If you’re a home cook, a culinary student, or just someone who has always wanted to start a food business, let’s talk.

Drop me a DM with a bit about your background and why you love the food industry. We can grab a coffee (on me) and I'll share the full concept with you.",2,1767519650.0,AmdavadClassifieds,0,1.0,False

We hadn't seen each other in quite a while, so I was very happy to see them. However, the meeting was not a pleasant one.

As soon as they entered the house, I noticed that Damian was watching me, as if he wanted to figure something out. Finally, he asked me directly who I was. I replied that I went to school with his dad. Then he asked:

* Are you my dad's lover?

My eyes nearly popped out of my head in surprise, but I figured the kid must have misunderstood something. I asked him if he meant ""friend"" (in Polish, ""lover"" and ""friend"" can sound similar to a child). His answer:

* No, mommy and daddy were arguing yesterday about some of daddy's lover, but I don't know who it is. (In Polish, we distinguish between the masculine and feminine forms of the word ""lover,"" so I know that Damian is talking about a man).

Earlier, my eyes almost popped out of my head, but after hearing those words, I had to pick them up off the floor. I looked at Bruce, he was white as a ghost, and Talia was boiling with anger. I decided there was no point in pursuing the subject, so I offered to turn on the TV for Damian and invited his parents for coffee and pound cake (cameo from the story ""My wife doesn't approve of using measuring cups for baking""). 

The atmosphere was very tense. My wife and I tried to defuse the situation, but to no avail. Bruce sat with his head down, and Talia shot daggers at him. They drank their coffee in less than five minutes and announced that they were going home. We didn't stop them.

As soon as they left, my wife and I talked about it for a looooong time. We wondered if we should ask Bruce for details. On the one hand, it's none of our business, but on the other hand, their son asked if I was the lover, so I guess I can ask, right?",9,1767519428.0,AITAH,5,0.91,False

We've been in the lifestyle for about two years now, and have consistently had conversations about fantasies or things we see eachother doing with others that we think can be fun and exciting. Plus we both genuinely enjoy connecting with people and never shy away from making new friends.

My wife met a guy a few weeks ago and they exchanged numbers, they've been texting ever since. They've sent photos back and forth, both regular and sexy pictures, and have been getting frisky with the texts as well. Mind you, all that and all relevant conversations between them has been communicated between my wife and I and we've been entirely open throughout this time, with me seeing texts and pictures my wife has sent as well. 

After speaking about it for some time we agreed that we'd both be okay with bringing him around and planning some alone time between them so she can feel out the chemistry. A couple days later, what started as a planned coffee date, kinda just turned into a full-on hookup at our home while I was at work. There was no secrecy, no deception, and we’ve had several honest conversations since then that actually brought us closer. I’m genuinely okay with what happened, and this felt less like a mistake and more like the moment theory turned into reality, as we've had the conversation of this exact scenario taking place, whether it came about naturally or not.

We’re very new to all of this specifically, but we’re also looking at it as the beginning of our progression, not a one-off experiment. Right now we’re being intentional about processing, recalibrating boundaries based on real experience, and figuring out what kind of dynamic we want to build going forward—both individually and together.

For those with experience: what surprised you after that first real encounter? Were there things that bothered you only after some time passed? Anything you wish you’d slowed down, clarified, or leaned into earlier?

We’re open, communicating well, and exploring this with curiosity rather than urgency. Mostly looking to learn from people who’ve navigated similar beginnings—and possibly connect with others who approach this thoughtfully too.

1q3loqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q3loqf/you_prioritize_your_family_over_our_family/,"""You prioritize YOUR family over OUR family"" (uncommitted husband, of controlling wife?)","Hi. 35M with wife 37F. My first marriage, her second. 3 kids, oldest is from her previous marriage to violent abusive alcoholic ex-husband. Met when oldest was 3, now married 11 years.

Wife has history of suffered abuse, first religious from cult-like family, then escaped to abusive husband, then escaped to self-reliance. Homesteader. Strongest defense mechanism is cutting people out of her life. Fear of abandonment issues.

I have no history of abuse. Oldest of 3 brothers. People-pleaser and peacekeeper. Not much ambition or social proactivity. Confident in my devotion to my family, but have made so many personal/social sacrifices now that I'm starting to wonder if this crosses into abuse and controlling-spouse territory. We have a fight after most family gatherings with my side, due to something one of my family members said or did or didn't say or do.

The issue: I was over at my brother's house for a sleepover thing. The three of us bros never hang out outside of holidays, even though we live within 45 minutes of each other. I have no other friends aside from couples my wife and I know. No work friends. Don't see college friends, even in state. My wife allowed this sleepover event we call ""Geekbrover"" due to her taking the kids to a cousin-sleepover that night, which she considers babysitting and thus working, making this sleepover an extra kind act in her eyes. Landmines all over this.

We did Geekbrover for the first time last year, but it went ok. Video games and pizza, nostalgia fun fest. This year though, it was at my brother's house instead of ours, and his wife was there with their baby, my nephew whom I haven't seen much.

My brother asked his wife to help demonstrate a fun video game they liked which required even teams. She helped show it off and we all had fun, then she left after less than an hour and I never saw her again.

We joked about whether my son and nephew counted as ""bros"" for future Geekbrovers.

In the morning, I woke up at like 9:30. Brother wanted to go get everyone coffee (maker was broken) and asked if I could watch my nephew for 15 minutes, and I was super happy to. I texted my wife that I was thinking of her (had sent a few of these texts throughout the night). Other brother woke up, we ate breakfast and had coffee, plus serious talks and some short funny videos. Texted my wife around 11:20 that we'd pray and then I'd head out, which got a Heart emoji.

We bros prayed for each other, and then I got in the car at 11:41. Saw she sent a text at 11:39 asking me to get grapes at the store. I called once I left (I always call when heading home, including each day after work), and everything was fine, with ""love you"" at the end from both of us. Got grapes and came home.

My wife met me in the garage. She asked how things went, and I started telling her different fun things we did. She got mad immediately when she heard that my brother's wife played with us for a short time. My wife said she was ""babysitting all night while you were up playing with another woman."" She also said it was just like my mom, always inserting herself and trying to ""claim"" me and get me back into my old family. She then decided that me coming home at the time I did was NOT ok, due to me ""babysitting for [the sister-in-law]"" instead of coming home to my own son, meaning I was prioritizing someone else's kid over my own.

Everything I said or did from then on had a worsening effect if my wife could make it so in her head, or zero effect if it counter-evidenced her increasingly wild narrative of my betrayal. She cussed me out, shoved me out our bedroom door right into our middle kid and locked it shut, refused to let me explain or rebut anything at all. When we finally talked for a minute, she just made more stuff up for her narrative. I told her I'd let her sleep on it and maybe we'll talk tomorrow.

The entire time, I'm also playing with the kids, helping them out, doing housework with everyone, putting stuff away, not being lazy or disregarding the kids. Showing affection, even though my wife pulls away conspicuously. The kids can tell she's mad at me specifically though she snaps at everyone.

The next day, our oldest confronts her about being snappy and mean yesterday, and my wife yells her down and says ""We were all tired yesterday, that stuff doesn't count."" But it only excuses her stuff, of course.

My wife and I have sent a few long texts back and forth explaining our positions... hers full of cussing and exclamation points and accusations of me ""choosing your family over me and the kids"" and such, and mine trying to rationally lay out what I hear her saying and what my responses are. As always in our arguments, I am the one trying to lay a peaceful baseline for being heard, having equal opportunity to make a case, and generally working it out like rational adults. I always try to determine what I did wrong, honestly and humbly. In all of our arguments, it ends when I admit to whatever I did do wrong, and she does not forgive, but rather decides to stop witholding her affection. I can count on one hand the amount of apologies I've ever received, even though every argument is filled with her humiliating and berating accusations and wild narratives and projections.

Our talk tonight went very badly. She refused to listen and I finally told her I've had it with her insecurity. That I utterly reject accusations of not prioritizing my family. The kids *know* that I love them and I love their mom. My wife responded with mimicry and mocking and accused me of excuses and arrogance and thinking everyone is wrong except me... Absolute projection. I told her this is like Middle School behavior, and she said that's what *I* was doing. I asked if she could even hear herself, and how petty and insecure she sounds, and that this is emotional *Abuse.* Which I knew might be the final trigger word, but I had just... had it.

She responded by getting up and saying she doesn't feel ""safe."" I responded that I didn't and have never *once* raised a finger against her or tried to harm her in any way. She said, ""Yeah, that's what they all say..."" and left the room. I had an extremely rare moment of slamming my hands on the bed and screaming internally/whispering. I didn't want to wake the kids or ever give her a moment of angry lashing out to point to. I then left the room with my morning stuff and told her she could sleep in the bed and I'll take the couch. She sleeps better in the bed and when she's tired she makes the whole house miserable.

My wife sent me a long message a couple hours in the making, filled with statements of (dubious) fact, telling me our relationship has changed, that I have chosen ""my family"" over her and the kids, that she will ""be civil, but NOT pretend to be the loving wife"", etc... and I have no one else to turn to.

We both, in tonight's final verbal argument, said that any mature and loving couple who heard this conversation would see the other as the child and ourselves as the grown-up in this situation. I dared her to ask a single person on earth, even a non-person like ChatGPT who only ever agrees with you. Me, I'm asking Reddit AITAH. Hi, friends...


I guess this AITAH has multiple layers of potential AH victims. Am I one to my wife, and I'm just wrong? Is 11 years of a stable loving husband not enough to rid her of her paranoid insecurity at being betrayed, and I'm TAH for not believing an abuse victim's story? Am I TAH to myself, for staying in this marriage? How do I not be an AH to my kids through all of this?

As usual, I was using Reddit as I did on any other day, but suddenly Reddit recommended me this sub (maybe the algorithms are not always evil, lol).  I read a comment from one person here, I don't remember who, I don't remember what the post was about, but this person recommended the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. And the rest is history. Last year, I quit FB/IG due to a mental health breakdown due to toxic features of Instagram (fomo, stories, ghosting, etc). I was out for about 5 months, but I didn't have any plans for how to use that time more efficiently. I only remember that I could get back to one of my favorite hobbies, video games! I finished Astrobot, and I felt like when I was a kid, for example, but besides that, my mind is kind of diffuse; I don't remember so much at all. I feel more present and less glued to my phone since that moment, though. In April, I think unfortunately, I got back into these shitty apps called ""social media"" (IG/FB/TIKTOK). On Halloween, I got into a similar turning point in my life, and I noticed, fortunately, that I  was feeling bad due to the toxic behaviors of people, the algorithm, and so on.

Today I'm following a better plan. Deleted FB permanently a month ago, similar case with Instagram, but I only deactivated since Halloween, some days ago I did the unimaginable...I requested to delete my account permanently. I do not have any social media apps on my iPhone now. I only use Reddit on my computer with boundaries: I deactivated all the notifications, and I'm using a browser that allows me to ""zap"" elements on any website (it's called Arc Browser), so I got rid of the notifications icon, for instance. Also, I use ad blockers. And I watch YouTube on my Apple TV4k (in this way, it makes more friction, I think), and the content I usually watch is about hobbies, entertainment, audio, pour-over coffee, etc. And I use a VPN as an ad blocker on YouTube cuz I hate Google for some reasons so I prefer paying for a vpn than giving my money to them, lol).  
When I have to use YouTube on my computer (design tutorial, for example, I deactivated YouTube Shorts with an extension.

I'm reading more than ever before intentionally! I enjoy reading and even faster on my E-Reader. I started to be more outside, and I usually go to an arthouse theater to watch indie films more o.r at home using a device dedicated to this task (apple tv4k). I bought a treadmill to do exercise. Recently I bought a Casio watch from Japan, and I couldn't be more excited the day when I receive it! Also, I want to add that specialty Coffee is one of my favourite hobbies (yes, definitely is a hobby, a sensory one). Also, I'm looking for other hobbies as well, to experiment, and to know which ones are the best fit for me. Also, I want to finish some video games I couldn't finish. Metaphor Refantazio, for instance, I wouldn't categorize this type of game with Candy Crush, for example, JRPGs are like graphic novels after all. Balance is key. I'm becoming an analog person, but not for the trend (actually, I feel cringe when I notice people who are doing this to get a TikTok personality, lmao), but rather for a philosophy

Something that all of us need to understand is that there are hobbies for everyone, and there are hobbies that maybe are not the best fit, and that's okay! Woodwork is something expensive for me; for example, I remember Newport recommended this as a leisure activity. I can't do CrossFit either due to a medical problem that I have...  
Literally, I think I don't have any friends now. I feel good in solitude, but after all of that shit, it's more difficult to trust anyone

**Do not compare yourself with anyone else;** **follow your process based on your context.** As Jaron Lanier said in his book *10 Arguments to Delete Your Social Media Accounts Right Now*, take the things that can be useful for you. I don't know you, I cannot tell you what to do, that would be dogmatic, and I agree! I hate dogmatic shit. There's not only one path to becoming a digital minimalist. Do not feel pressured by anyone, even people who are on this sub.

It just doesn't make sense to me that people can cohabit in massive numbers with total strangers and not feel uncomfortable. Strange, unknown noises at all times of the day. Sirens going, never any answer as to why. Unhinged (mentally ill and unsupported, likely) people wandering around we are supposed to just ignore. Homeless people we are supposed to just ignore. 

Such a bizarre mixture of smells. Coffee, car exhaust, sewage. So many people in heels clicky-clacking down the concrete footpaths. Gaggles of female friends wandering about at night laughing loudly amongst themselves. Groups of men loitering in the dark doing seemingly nothing.

And one of the biggest things that's always made me feel weird but I've never heard anyone talk about: how businesses - eateries, art galleries, hotels, yoga studios - create atmospheres inside of them to make you feel at ease as if outside isn't just this concrete jungle chaotic nightmare. It's like a lie. Let's pretend we are somewhere nice while nestled in this filthy pit. It doesn't work on me, I don't forget where I am. The overwhelming energy of the city follows me everywhere I go.

**Key Features:**

1. 100% on-device transcription
2. Keyboard QWERTY keys are retained to help in addition to the voice based typing
3. Supports 1000+ languages (auto-detected)
4. Helps you with an **Universal Clipboard on iOS** in addition to the voice typing experience (in the same canvas) so you can copy bulk across many apps and then paste them wherever you need.
5. There are noise cancellation filters and voice activity detection models running locally to ensure you have better accuracy in your output (enabling voice isolation mode in a noisy environment produces much better results in general as the model is running locally)

**What does this address?**

1. Unnecessary Cloud based processing of your voice - you don't want your data leaving the device for privacy concerns
2. A clipboard in addition to the keyboard in the same area personally helps me a lot to juggle around the things I copied and ensure I don't need to swipe back and forth the apps to paste them immediately
3. A rich set of language support (likely unavailable offline with other competitors ranging from English, Arabic, French, Spanish and all indic languages including Tamil, Hindi and many more)

**What I need from you?**

I am currently working on finalising the product to publish on the App Store. I am surveying if anyone would be interested in this? If yes, I am planning to publish this with rich free tier of 4000 words per week (unlike 2000 you get elsewhere) and price the app at 5$ per month (this is for the efforts put in the development and research - similar to buy me a coffee).

***First of all, I apologize for the length of this text, but it was the most I could write to convey exactly how I feel***

in November, I had an episode where I drank a little more coffee than I am used to. my body naturally reacted (palpitations, involuntary tremors... the body’s natural response), I got really scared and anxious because I didn’t know what was happening with me (I always think of the worst) and from that day on, the anxiety I felt never “left my body.”

At first, I was very skeptical about whether or not it was anxiety: I had never felt what it was like to be anxious. 

And that's precisely what has been holding me back ever since: I'm in a dilemma about whether what I'm feeling now is anxiety or something serious (or not, but I don't know).

For a week now, I've had a very slight sensation in my head, not even pain, just a slight sensation: **if anyone can relate, please let me know so I don't feel so alone ehehe**.

Some days it's at the front (on my forehead), other days it's in another area, etc. The fact is that since I've been feeling anxious (nov.) and the symptoms have changed location, it's been a feeling of heavy breathing, I've also felt my heart beating noticeably in my chest, and now it's the feeling in my head again…

I've already talked to my doctor about it, and he told me that anxiety can produce symptoms even without any trigger, and that the fact that I'm constantly watching and checking my body increases the possibility of feeling things that don't exist OR that are made up by my mind and associating them with something bad. **I've also had complete blood tests recently (last week) and the results came back perfect, really good.**

Even so, the fact is that I continue to feel small things without any kind of awareness. They appear out of nowhere, last a few hours, sometimes most of the day, and always comes a time of day when they disappear. And sometimes, even when I'm distracted, I continue to feel them.

**But they are always mild sensations, I can never say it's pain.** 

I think that perhaps because they are mild and also because they occasionally change location, the symptoms I have are fabricated by my mind, under the pretext that I have something serious. **As if subconsciously I have this impression, my body responds and reacts, snowballing the situation.** I have also researched the subject and it seems that I may be right.

But I'm always reticent: what if it's not? Why don't the sensations go away? **I never dismiss this idea.**

The fact is that if the coffee incident had never happened, I wouldn't be writing this post. Everything I've felt and experienced has been derived from that day, but I'm not traumatized; in fact, I've gone back to drinking coffee normally.

***First of all, I apologize for the length of this text, but it was the most I could write to convey exactly how I feel***

in November, I had an episode where I drank a little more coffee than I am used to. my body naturally reacted (palpitations, involuntary tremors... the body’s natural response), I got really scared and anxious because I didn’t know what was happening with me (I always think of the worst) and from that day on, the anxiety I felt never “left my body.”

At first, I was very skeptical about whether or not it was anxiety: I had never felt what it was like to be anxious. 

And that's precisely what has been holding me back ever since: I'm in a dilemma about whether what I'm feeling now is anxiety or something serious (or not, but I don't know).

For a week now, I've had a very slight sensation in my head, not even pain, just a slight sensation: **if anyone can relate, please let me know so I don't feel so alone ehehe**.

Some days it's at the front (on my forehead), other days it's in another area, etc. The fact is that since I've been feeling anxious (nov.) and the symptoms have changed location, it's been a feeling of heavy breathing, I've also felt my heart beating noticeably in my chest, and now it's the feeling in my head again…

I've already talked to my doctor about it, and he told me that anxiety can produce symptoms even without any trigger, and that the fact that I'm constantly watching and checking my body increases the possibility of feeling things that don't exist OR that are made up by my mind and associating them with something bad. **I've also had complete blood tests recently (last week) and the results came back perfect, really good.**

Even so, the fact is that I continue to feel small things without any kind of awareness. They appear out of nowhere, last a few hours, sometimes most of the day, and always comes a time of day when they disappear. And sometimes, even when I'm distracted, I continue to feel them.

**But they are always mild sensations, I can never say it's pain.** 

I think that perhaps because they are mild and also because they occasionally change location, the symptoms I have are fabricated by my mind, under the pretext that I have something serious. **As if subconsciously I have this impression, my body responds and reacts, snowballing the situation.** I have also researched the subject and it seems that I may be right.

But I'm always reticent: what if it's not? Why don't the sensations go away? **I never dismiss this idea.**

The fact is that if the coffee incident had never happened, I wouldn't be writing this post. Everything I've felt and experienced has been derived from that day, but I'm not traumatized; in fact, I've gone back to drinking coffee normally.

**Am I a hypochondriac, and was this triggered by what happened to me? Can hypochondria/anxiety (even if I don't feel it) cause real symptoms? How can I know if I don't have something really bad organically? Has anyone else been in this situation?**

The apartment isn’t a home. It’s a curator.

I found its maintenance log behind the thermostat. Years of data. My breathing. My micro-sleeps. Cortisol spikes. Finger twitches. Every pattern cataloged.

The walls aren’t pulsing. They’re rehearsing me. The floor secretes something sticky and metallic. I ran. My feet sank into it. Not wood. Membrane over fat. The apartment absorbs what it wants, inch by inch.

The pens on my desk rearranged themselves. Not how I like them. By my blood pressure. By my inhale-exhale rhythm.  Feels too precise to be coincidence.

I looked in the mirror. My reflection didn’t lag. It stepped out. Not me. Better. Sharper. Every imperfection erased.

I reached to touch it. My fingers sank into warm, yielding film. My veins fizzed. My thoughts weren’t mine.

I pressed my palm to the wall. It swallowed me in increments too small to notice. My thoughts, my routines, my pulse all cataloged, absorbed, re-encoded. I wasn’t leaving 12C. I was folding into it. ",1,1767518318.0,stories,0,1.0,False

The plastic case is kind of noisy if you squeeze it, like it's still a bit sticky, but besides that there's no visible signs of contamination.

And like one year ago, we went to a mall and I bought a Starbucks coffee, I have been saving my money for it, and my cousin didn't said anything though at that time, but yesterday he said "" Main tumhare saath jaakar pareshaan ho gya aapne khud toh starbucks ki 400 ki coffee li mujhe kuch nhi dilaya"" And then the younger cousin of mine he was asking for chips from my maasi, and maasi said no, then he said to my mom to give him chips, mom gave him 100 rupees said dukaan se jaakr le aa, and he said "" 100 rupay dekar ehsaan kar rahi ho jo chips aap laayi thi cheetos woh dedo (I bought it from my own pocket money) "", remember that he is only 10 and both of them are way too pampered by there parents.

I already do my no buy since end of 2024 beginning of 2025 and i did overall pretty good.

Today out of the blue i was doing weird things ...

I ended up on a designer clothes website ... looking for a back up of my favorite cardigan (i got second hand for 20 fr). This is exactly behaviour i do not want to do and stopped doing since a long time... I have enough cardigans and clothes.

Now that i think about it, i guess my old habit was reactivated because yesterday I was looking for a replacement for a thermo coffee cup, because mine is yeaaars old and the layer of paint is breaking away... and my other thermo has dirt in places there should be no dirt....


Replacement of things is so tricky for me. I know the old thermos dont look good anymore. But also it still works... So i don't throw them away, if i could use it as a back up again. 
But why then buy a new one if it still works but just looks ugly? 

All those decision make me feel overwhelmed. And also reactivating my browsing habits of ""just looking""... 
How do you handle those things?

Thank you for your advise.

I just know he is the right person for me as he is the only one I have ever had s3x with and it felt so great (I refuse to call my grape s3x. It wasn't). This matters because fear of intimacy kept me from dating

I’m 36, originally from the US East Coast, living in Germany long-term and based near Hamburg most of the time. I’m here for actual friendship with people who could realistically meet in person at some point in the future in a best case scenario.  

I work full-time in a senior eCommerce role, so I’m not a constant texter. I do better with voice notes, and I’m open to calls once we’ve chatted a bit. Replies can be intermittent, but I’m consistent and I match the effort I get.

Outside of work, music is my main thing. I play bass, sing, and do stage and studio work. I’m into low-key hangs like coffee, walks, markets, food spots, and live shows.

I’m in a happy relationship and this is strictly platonic. Also being honest about fit, I’m not into sports culture, cars, boxing, or drinking as a main hobby, so I often don’t click with a lot of guys. I’d be especially happy to make lesbian friends since that dynamic has worked best for me.

That changed when I started writing little prompts just to make my own life easier with the boring, repeatable stuff I always put off.

Now I use it for things like:

**Planning my week**

    “I work 40 hours, want 3 gym sessions, and have some family stuff on the weekend. Help me build a schedule that’s realistic.”

**Turning notes into to-dos**

    After meetings or voice notes, I just paste the mess in and say: “Clean this up into a task list, prioritize it, and suggest deadlines.”

**Writing awkward messages**

    “Send a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”

**Quick meal ideas**

    I’ll say: “What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?” → it gives me a week’s worth of meals in 10 seconds.

**No more last-minute gifts**

    “Gift ideas for a friend who’s into design, hiking, and coffee. Budget under $60.”

**Actually understanding adult stuff**

    “Explain how taxes work like I’m 12” → better than Googling 12 blog posts.

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.35U

League: Miami Dolphins vs New England Patriots (3:25PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: Got some really great news, but also bad news! Great news is that I just found out that I am still a DK Silver Tier member (I think they recently changed the Dynasty Rewards rules) and will be still handicapping POTD until further notice. This also means that I might be able to launch my own discord server. Okay, now for the bad news.. **The bad news is that last POTD was ANOTHER BAD BEAT!!!!! Bakes started out hot on the 1st drive and threw a passing TD to Cade Otton!** And he could have gotten his 2nd TD in the 2nd drive where the Bucs offense marched to the redzone again, but his receivers could not catch in the endzone. I don't blame them the weather conditions wasn't that great. But I did not expect that Bryce Young to out-throw Bakes in both passing TDs and passing yds. Bakes did throw a INT like I said he was going to, but I wasn't going to take a -141 odds on him to throw one, the plus money on 2+ TDs was just more appealing, unfortunately bad beat again. So that was the bad news which might not be that bad at all because it was just a 1U loss or some of you may have not tailed it. We also took an L on Sam Darnold's prop bet as well. Who saw that coming? Both QBs (Purdy and Darnold) to have 0 Passing TDs!

**Matchup:** I'm taking a chance wit another incentive prop bet. There's something to be played for in this game as well, so this wager collaborate wit each other. **Stefon Diggs has couple incentives in this game, 8 Receptions for $500K and 30 Receiving Yds for $500K.** He can easily cash the 30 Receiving Yds wit a couple of catch, so I'm taking his Reception prop 6+ because there's more value. **Diggs also had a big game last game and caught 6 receptions, he's has gone over this line the previous week as well (9 Rec. 138 Receiving Yds vs Ravens)** Diggs has played a big role in the past 2 weeks and I anticipate that he plays a major role in beating the Fins at home.

**Additionally Fins defense allowed the 9th most receptions to their opponents and they are pretty much in the mid thru the passing yds.** Fins defense and secondary is really nothing special, I don't think they will be able contain elite route runner Diggs. The only question I have for this particular matchup is if he gets benched in the 2nd half (which I will present my scenario at the end of this writeup)

One, the Pats must win and second, the Broncos must lose to the Chargers** (that's not happening). So there is something to be played for the Pats and I think they can smash 2 birds wit 1 stone in this game, feed both Hunter Henry and Stefon Diggs their receptions and beat the Fins.

**So there is one concern I have for this particular prop bet and that's if the Broncos are blowing out the Chargers early then I suspect that Pats bench their starters in the 2nd half.** So there's some risk, I mean everything has risk, it's really how you value the risk-reward. I like to take a shot because **this Broncos team just play really close games and although I don't have a lot of faith in the backup qb for the Chargers to upset the Broncos, I think they stay afloat while Diggs try to get his.** He might get his receptions mark before the Broncos start blowing the Chargers out. So, yes I value this risk-reward wager, the question is if you value this wager wit this kind of risk?

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Stefon Diggs 6+ Rec. Might as well throw Hunter Henry 5+ Rec. as well. Diggs gets all 6 Receptions in the 1st half.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Took a few sips before mixing the bottom sugar syrup stuff. On it's own, their matcha tastes good; a bit vegetal but not too much. Low key regret getting the brown sugar one kasi the syrup is just too sweet it overpowers the matcha. If I come back, I'll definitely just get the plain matcha latte. If you're passing by the area, it's definitely worth trying. I liked this one  better than the one I got from Ujisan in Makati.

# Unlock Versatile Brewing: What to Expect from the HiBREW H2B 5-in-1 Price

The HiBREW H2B 5-in-1 coffee maker is a versatile addition to any kitchen, offering multiple brewing options in one sleek unit. Understanding its price point involves looking at the value it delivers across its five core functions: espresso, drip coffee, K-Cup compatibility, Nespresso pods, and even tea.

While exact pricing fluctuates with retailers, promotions, and region, the HiBREW H2B 5-in-1 typically falls into a mid-range category for multi-function coffee machines. This positions it as an accessible investment for those seeking convenience and variety without the premium cost of separate, specialized brewers. You're essentially getting the functionality of five different machines at a fraction of the combined price.

*   **Cost-Effective Versatility:** Instead of buying individual espresso makers, drip coffee machines, and pod brewers, the H2B consolidates these at a significantly lower overall cost.
*   **Feature-Rich Design:** Expect features like programmable settings, different brew sizes, and easy-to-clean components, which contribute to its value proposition.
*   **Ideal for Experimentation:** Its attractive price makes it a great option for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy experimenting with different bean types, roasts, and brewing methods.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sober Sunday Everyone!

It’s my honor to be hosting the DCI.  I’ve been here a while and decided it was time to step up and take the reins for a week.

Sobriety has given me SO much, but one of my favorite things is clarity.  My Sunday used to be spent recovering.  Popping some pain killers for my headache, hydrating like crazy, wasting money on food delivery, and feeling miserable.  Now I look forward to Sunday.  I’m up early, coffee in hand, enjoying a quiet morning with CLARITY.  No anxiety about the night before.  It wasn’t easy at first, but the longer I’m without it, the better it gets.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s not all rainbows and sunshine, but it is immensely better than it was.  If you’re struggling, try starting with a full weekend.  Sometimes you don’t realize how terrible you’re feeling until you get a couple of days under your belt.

What’s one thing you’re grateful for today?

Do you have a word that you’re focusing on to carry you through the week?

1q3l983,https://www.reddit.com/r/DryJanuary/comments/1q3l983/doing_dj_for_the_first_time_and_already_wondering/,Doing DJ for the first time and already wondering if I should stop drinking forever,"Hello, 

Alcohol was a big part of my life for like 10 years? (I am 26 now). I was really shy, often uncomfortable around people, so alcohol helped me a lot to relax and socialize. I think especially around 18-23, when you are experiencing and discovering a lot about life, I met so many people thanks to alcohol (and drugs), people that I would not have met otherwise and learned a lot from them. I was really thankful to alcohol for helping me improve my life. It made me more relaxed and happy. I really needed to go out and drink on weekends, and to have a few drinks also during the week to cope before the weekend. 

BUT 

In the last few years, there were times when I was drinking every day, and drinking A LOT. Especially during holidays. I had hangovers everyday, and had to drink early to make them gone. If this was only for short periods, I couldn't anyway stay sober for more than 3 days. And once I started drinking, I couldn't stop. I could not enjoy events or meetings or anything if there was no alcohol involved. You wanted to meet me for a walk, an exhibition or a coffee? I was already thinking about the drink wed have afterward. You invited me for dinner? Id bring a tons of alcohol just to make sure I had enough. I reached the point I could not spend time with people sober. If I was not drinking I felt uncomfortable, awkward, shy, stupid. Even around my closest friends who don't drink at all, I had to drink anyway, even alone. 

AND THE SHAME 

I had sometimes since my teenage years some really sad drunk moments, like started to cry and to trauma dump lol while drinking too much. But in 2025 IT HAPPENED A LOT. And I unlocked a new type of drunk: the angry violent drunk. Sometimes in public. And it is really shameful. Sometimes alone, even to the point of self-harm. And it is really shameful too. 

I still have good moments with alcohol. And for me doing DJ was just impossible before. But I felt really motivated this year. At the same time, I feel that alcohol became a huge part of me. People call me when they want to drink and to waste themselves. They offer me nice bottles. Even me I feel it became like the biggest part of me. But when I reflect on 2025 I had too many bad moments with alcohol. More too bad moments than too good moments, and most of the alcohol moments I had especially last year seem to me kinda useless. 

  
I think I started drinking to fill a void, but the more I drank, the more the void took over, until the void became me. And only alcohol seemed to matter.

I need to relearn how to enjoy life sober. I need to relearn how to socialize, speak and bond with people sober. And I think it is gonna take more than one month. I am really motivated, because I am tired of spending my life between work, bars, and hangovers. There is so much more in life and I really want to enjoy it. I want the void to shrink and to rediscover who I really am.

When I think about alcohol I feel disgusted. At the same time it is scary and a sad to imagine a life without it being a part of me and of my life. 

Yesterday, I went to a bar, with really interesting people that I barely know. On the way I felt soo anxious especially for the alcohol part. But the music was great. I stuttered a bit and was not able to speak much because I was uncomfortable. But I was able to manage the urge to drink. And I felt more comfortable and happy anyway after a few moment. I had for the first time a really nice experience in a bar, without drinking, and I am really happy and proud of myself. This was just the first step. I really hope I will feel more comfortable with myself soon <3",6,1767517267.0,DryJanuary,3,1.0,False

No last-minute scrambling, no rushed captions, no second-guessing whether your content actually resonates. Just 5 polished, platform-optimized posts, waiting for you to hit 'publish.'

Now, here’s the real question: What would you do with the time you’d save? Would you finally tackle that project you’ve been putting off? Spend more time with your team, your family, or even just enjoy a quiet coffee without the looming pressure of social media deadlines?

The truth is, most of us get stuck in the cycle of ‘content creation as a chore’—something that feels like homework rather than a tool for growth. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? What if the complexity of crafting posts for multiple platforms, tailoring them to different audiences, and keeping up with ever-changing algorithms could be simplified?

This isn’t just about saving time. It’s about reclaiming it. Time that could be spent growing your business, connecting with customers, or simply breathing easier. So, I’ll ask again: If you had those 5 posts ready to go, what would you do with the hours you’d gain? Drop your answer in the comments—I’d love to hear your thoughts.

\- i miss our walks, stopping at every corner for you to spend 5 minutes sniffing one spot of a bush, being pulled too hard when you could sense a particularly good smell from a few feet away. 

\- i miss your howl. the firetrucks that drive by our house are so quiet now, because you aren’t there to alert the whole neighborhood that there was a firetruck. every time they drive passed, i cry. i cry so much because your howl was beautiful. 

\- i miss seeing your face as soon as i opened my eyes. even on days i slept in, you cuddled up to me and did not care it was passed breakfast time. you loved to cuddle in the morning  

\- i miss you sleeping on my feet. i fell asleep so much quicker with you there, keeping my feet warm. 

\- i miss coming home from work and you getting your full body wiggles because you were so excited. i used to get so annoyed when you’d smack my legs with such force with your thick ass tail, but now i miss that too. 

\- i miss you licking up my tears when i would cry, it distracted me from whatever i was sad about every time. 

\- i miss reading in bed and you laying belly up with your legs straight up in the air. it always made me giggle, and i loved giving you belly rubs as i read. 

\- i miss telling you about my day, telling you my secrets and simply telling you how much i loved you. i especially miss saying “i love you, be a good dog!” every single time i left the house. an addition, i miss putting on cozy lofi youtube videos for you so you didn’t sit in silence at home. 

\- i miss seeing teddy (our kitten) cuddle up to you, you two did not know eachother long but you quickly bonded. he was so little but i loved that he got to be the big spoon. he grieves you, he sleeps in all of your favorite spots and cuddles up with your toy. i bought a dog-shaped plastic dog hair container that i carry with me daily and he smells it frequently. he misses you. 

\- i miss our trips to the coffee stand. every single one of those girls loves you, and they miss seeing your happy face in my backseat. i’m so glad that you were spoiled with treats, pup cups, pets and kisses each time we went. 

\- i miss your huffing and puffing at 9pm SHARP when it was time for bed. you did not like staying up too late. 

\- i miss your cute tooth gap, you loved to play with those damn rocks and you broke your front tooth. the vet had to extract both of your front teeth, and i sang “all you want for christmas is your two front teeth!” i’m sad that we did not get another christmas together. 

\- i miss fetch. you could go forever, i miss watching you roll over your tennis ball i think it felt good on your back. 

i could go on, my sweet girl. i miss everything. i love you so much and my heart hurts everyday that you’re not here with me. you were the best dog i could’ve asked for.

According to their docs, ROZO's journey began in a small boba shop in San Francisco during the summer of 2025. Someone tried to pay with their USDC wallet, but got an error. Why? The merchant only accepted USDC on Base chain, while their wallet only supported USDC on Stellar.

Sound familiar? 😅

Here's the crazy part: USDC exists on **29 different blockchains** – and that's not even counting USDT. Think about that for a second. To buy a simple cup of coffee, we're expected to understand 29 different chains, different stablecoins, different bridges, different fees? That's *not* how money should work.

That's where **ROZO** comes in – they're building what they call the ""Visa for Stablecoins."" And honestly, after diving into their docs, this might be the missing piece we've all been waiting for.

# What makes ROZO different?

Instead of making users navigate the blockchain jungle, ROZO uses something called **""Intent-Based Payments.""** This is the key insight that blew my mind:

>

You just state what you want to happen – the *outcome* – without worrying about *how* it happens. No more ""which chain?"" ""which token?"" ""do I have enough gas?"" nonsense. ROZO handles all that complexity under the hood.

# How it actually works (the simple version)

ROZO has built what they call ""stablecoin abstractions"" through two key layers:

1. **Intent Address Layer**: Smart contracts that are deterministically generated (using CREATE2 on EVM chains, PDAs on Solana) that encode payment parameters like amount, fromChain, toChain, token, and receiver.
2. **Execution Layer**: When you send funds to an intent address, ""solvers"" detect your payment and instantly settle to the merchant in 1-3 seconds. ROZO routes the funds through protocols or peer-to-peer as needed.

The result? **Payments complete in less than 5 seconds** regardless of which chain your customer is on, and merchants receive stablecoins seamlessly.

# Real use cases that actually matter

This isn't just theoretical – ROZO is solving real problems:

**☕ For Real-World Businesses**  
Imagine walking into a café, scanning a QR code, and paying instantly with whatever stablecoin you have in your wallet. No wallet popups, no token approvals, no waiting for bridges to complete. Tourists, digital nomads, and locals can all pay in seconds using their existing crypto balances. Businesses get listed on ROZO's web app and become discoverable by crypto-paying users nearby.

**💻 For Online Services & AI**  
ROZO is compatible with the emerging x402 payment protocol (launched by Coinbase) that enables instant stablecoin payments over HTTP. This means developers can embed ROZO's payment system directly into HTTP 402 flows, enabling seamless microtransactions for:

* API access
* SaaS subscriptions (pay-as-you-go without Stripe)
* AI agent services
* No-code tools and indie hacker projects

The docs mention specific use cases like OpenRouter and [Creatify.ai](http://Creatify.ai) – services that need permissionless monetization without the friction of traditional payment gateways.

**🕶️ Privacy Built-In**  
Unlike most crypto payment systems that tie everything to your identity, ROZO uses single-use intent addresses and ephemeral data flows to minimize metadata leakage. Merchants receive funds without knowing your wallet history, and you transact without exposing your holdings or behavioral patterns. For off-chain flows, they even support anonymous top-ups and proxy checkout layers that resemble the privacy of handing over physical cash.

# Why this feels different

As someone who's spent countless hours analyzing cross-chain bridge data on Dune (and seeing how often transactions fail or get stuck), ROZO's approach feels genuinely different. They're not just building another bridge – they're rebuilding the *entire payment experience* around user intent rather than technical implementation.

The ""tap to pay"" experience they're building isn't just a gimmick – it's the missing UX layer that could finally bring crypto payments to mainstream adoption. When you can pay for coffee as easily as you do with Apple Pay, but with the benefits of stablecoins (no chargebacks, instant settlement, lower fees), that's when crypto stops being ""crypto"" and just becomes ""money.""

# My thoughts

I'm usually skeptical of projects that claim to solve ""fragmentation"" because it's such a hard problem, but ROZO's approach makes technical sense. By focusing on outcomes rather than processes, they're attacking the problem from the right angle. The fact that they're building compatibility with existing standards like x402 shows they understand the importance of interoperability.

The real test will be merchant adoption and actual user experience, but the architecture they've described – with deterministic intent addresses, liquidity solvers, and cross-chain routing – seems robust enough to handle real-world scale.

**Hot take:** If ROZO delivers on even 80% of their vision, they could become the invisible infrastructure that finally makes crypto payments work for normal humans. Not traders, not degens – actual people buying coffee, paying for software, and tipping content creators.

Has anyone here tried ROZO yet? I'd love to hear real-world experiences, especially around the 5-second settlement time and how the intent-based system actually feels in practice. The docs are impressive, but I'm always more convinced by actual user stories.

*Disclosure: Just a developer who's genuinely excited about good UX in crypto – not affiliated with ROZO, not financial advice, DYOR, etc.*

**TL;DR:** ROZO is building the ""Visa for Stablecoins"" using intent-based payments that hide all blockchain complexity. Pay with any token on any chain in one click, get settled in <5 seconds, and merchants receive stablecoins seamlessly. Solves the real problem of stablecoin fragmentation (USDC exists on 29 chains!) with actual technical architecture that makes sense. Could be the missing piece for mainstream crypto payments.",1,1767517017.0,u_AmirGMohseni,0,1.0,False

A bit about me: I’m easygoing, a good listener, and I value chemistry above everything else. I believe the best ""casual"" relationships are the ones where you actually enjoy each other's company as much as the physical side.

Start here.,"If you keep thinking “I need to declutter” but never know where to begin, you are not alone. For many people, clutter is not just visual. It adds stress, friction, and decision fatigue to everyday life. Here are 15 simple, organiser approved tips that actually help people start and keep going.

* Do not buy storage first - Declutter before buying boxes or baskets. Storage too early just hides clutter.
* Start with an easy win - A desk, bedside table, or coffee table. Small success builds momentum.
* Set a timer and play music - 30 minutes max. Stop when the timer ends.
* One in, one out - Every new item replaces an old one.
* Try KonMari by category - Clothes, books, papers, not room by room if that works better for you.
* Pick the method that suits you - There is no right way, only the way you will stick to.
* Leave sentimental items until last - Decision making gets easier with practice.
* Give everything a home - Clutter often comes from homeless items.
* Keep things visible - If you cannot see it, you forget it exists.
* Use vertical space - Hooks, shelves, backs of doors matter more than floor space.
* Use hidden spaces intentionally - Under beds and high cupboards are ideal for seasonal items.
* Fix it quickly or let it go - Broken items that linger usually stay broken.
* Plan donations before you start - Knowing where items are going reduces friction.
* Involve everyone who lives there - Shared systems work better than solo efforts.
* For small homes, intentional external self-storage can help when used thoughtfully. Many people rotate coats, sports gear, or sentimental items so their homes stay calm. But it needs to be used as an extension of the home, not a dumping ground.

Chapter One

  
  


	The morning her invitation arrived, Mona was running late for work. Her tiny apartment was a maelstrom of cashmere sweaters and practical shoes, with Mona squarely in its eye. When the bright purple envelope slid underneath her front door, it was no surprise that it went unnoticed.

“Of course I overslept. This is only the most important meeting of my career,” she muttered to herself while trying to shrug on a cardigan. An errant elbow sent an oversized vase crashing to the floor, completely burying the envelope under a cascade of dirt and ceramic shards. 

	“Oh, shitballs!” Mona swore, slamming the apartment door behind her in thunderous punctuation.

	Thankfully, the American Museum of Natural History wasn’t far from her building. She normally enjoyed her morning walks through Central Park, and often stopped to feed the ducks or admire the fiery Autumn foliage. This chilly October morning, however, her arm-pinwheeling madcap dash through the Ramble looked as if she had tripped and just hadn’t fallen yet.

	A cluster of yellow cabs blared their annoyance as Mona sprinted across Central Park West without looking either way. She vaulted the museum steps two-by-two, barely gasping a thank you to a very startled-looking academic who held the front door open for her. The staccato echo of Mona’s footfalls rebounded off the main hall’s cathedral ceiling, and drew more than a few annoyed glances.

	“Good morning, Clyde!” she shouted as she streaked past the morning museum guard. He glanced up from his newspaper to deliver a confused greeting, but she was already gone. The various exhibit halls on the way to the anthropology department were a blur of dead-eyed Neanderthals and animal skeletons. By the time she arrived at the dimly-lit door to her tiny broom closet office, Mona was completely out of breath. She had to stifle a scream when the door suddenly flew open and her research partner lurched out.

	“Oh my GOD, Mona, it’s about time! Your meeting with Teven is in *three* minutes!” Elaine whispered fiercely, pulling Mona into the cramped confines of their office. There was barely enough room inside to turn around, so Mona just dumped her handbag and cardigan over the back of her desk, completely burying the strange purple envelope that sat in the middle of her desktop. Elaine fussed over her like a mother hen, straightening Mona’s clothes and clucking to herself.

	“I slept right through my alarm, I-” Mona stopped, sniffing. “Wait, when are you going to Japan?”

	Elaine froze mid-fuss, her mouth dropping open.

	“Now how on Earth did you know that?” she asked.

	“The coins next to your purse, the copper ones with a hole in the center, could be from Denmark, Japan, or China. That, and the hatbox in the corner. You always buy a new hat when you go on holiday,” Mona said while smoothing out her pin-straight black hair.

	“Okay, but why did you sniff the air?”

	“Vinegar. Specifically, the type used in the traditional Japanese dish called sushi. I didn’t know you could get any around here at this time of the morning. You should eat that sooner than later, by the way. It is raw fish, after all.”

	Elaine shook her head, gave Mona a quick once-over, and pushed her towards the door.

	“This is New York, sweetie, of course there are 8 AM sushi joints. And yes, I did pick up an order this morning. You really are something else, you know that?”

	“I just notice things other people don’t. Now, wish me luck!” Mona shouted over her shoulder as she sprinted off.

	“Good luck! Dr. Pisof will be heading for his 8:45 with the other curators… and she’s gone.”

	Mona had to double back through the Hall of the Age of Man and its creepy Cro-Magnon mannequins to intercept the head curator of the Anthropology department, Teven Pisof. At first she thought she had missed him entirely, but after a cursory search she found him standing impatiently between two taxidermied beavers in the Inuit display.

Dr. Pisof was a repellant, rat-faced man with an obviously false toupee that looked like a regurgitated goat-eaten bird nest. He was a notorious misogynist who believed women had no place in academia, not even to brew coffee. Every interaction Mona had shared with him had been perfunctory, demeaning and dismissive. Even today, after eight months of waiting for an opening in his schedule, Dr. Pisof had deigned to meet Mona while walking between more important appointments.

	“It is about time, Miss Anthroarcanology!” Dr. Pisof’s tone walked a razor’s edge between disgust and derision. “I am supposed to be meeting with the paleontological society in three minutes. If I am late, so help you–”

	“Three minutes is more than enough, Dr. Pisof. Thank you so much for making time for me.” Mona hated her sycophantic behavior almost as much as she hated the head curator’s refusal to use contractions. “I can walk and talk, if that’s what you prefer.”

	“Bah, anthroarcanology. I have never heard of a more ridiculous proposition in my life, and I have heard some whoppers. It should not even be considered a pseudo-science!” Dr. Pisof stalked off, not even making eye contact with Mona. She reluctantly trailed behind him, fidgeting with the seams of her sleeves.

	“I disagree, sir. Magic, real or otherwise, has played an integral part in the development of humankind, from the earliest shamans and healers right up to–”

	“You can stop right there. Do you see what the sign on the wall up there says?” Dr. Pisof gestured angrily with his clipboard. “The Hall of Man. MAN. I will not hear any of this suffragette ‘humankind’ bunk, do you understand?”

	Mona felt a flush rise in her cheeks. She fought the urge to turn tail and run the other direction, swallowed hard, and smiled. At only twenty-two, she was the youngest junior curator in the museum’s history, and she didn’t get this far by backing down from old men in positions of power.

	“You’re absolutely right, sir. Let me elaborate: Merlin. Cagliostro. Moses. Flamel. All incredibly powerful men who indelibly altered the flow of history with their magic.”

	“And all utterly fictional! The American Natural History Museum deals in facts and tangibility, not some female flight of–”

	Dr. Pisof froze mid-sentence and mid-step. Mona came to a skidding stop, almost crashing into the curator’s back. He spun around to face her, his mousey face flushed an angry shade of maroon.

	“Is this some kind of *joke*?” Dr. Pisof hissed. His eyes flashed dangerously as he plucked a strange purple envelope from his clipboard and held it out for Mona to see. Written on its front in elaborate golden calligraphy were the words:

  


MS. MONA LISA HEARST, C/O HEAD CURATOR TEVEN PISSOFF 

~~MONA’S APARTMENT~~ 

~~MONA’S DESK~~ 

ANNEX HALLWAY

HALL OF THE AGE OF MAN

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY



	Mona gingerly plucked the envelope from Dr. Pisof’s fingers and flipped it over. A thick golden wax seal depicting two interwoven K’s secured the back flap in place. Her innate curiosity stoked, Mona cautiously snapped the seal in half and started to open the envelope.

	“I do not know what kind of game you are playing at, Miss–” Dr. Pisof craned his head down to read the front of the invitation. “–Hearst, but this is an outrageous waste of my ti–”

	As Mona eased open the flap, there was a sudden brassy burst of fanfare that seemed to come from every direction at once. Two geysers of glittery purple and gold confetti erupted from inside the envelope, then drifted down like winter snow. Dr. Pisof recoiled with a high-pitched shriek, but Mona couldn’t help but smile. She slid a thick piece of off-white parchment out, unfolded it, and started to read.

Please indicate your preference for the following: Braised Lamb/Spring Duck/Lobster Thermidor. NO SUBSTITUTIONS!



	“Klavier Kalterfall wants *me* at one of his salons?” Mona whispered. She was simultaneously numb and tingly all over, as if on the verge of passing out. “October 10th is today… oh, I have so much to do! I have to water all my plants, pack, rent a car…”

	“What the HELL is going on?!” squeaked Dr. Pisof. He was cowering in a diorama of the western prairies, ducked down behind a gigantic stuffed buffalo. Mona turned to face him, remembering he was still there.

	“Oh, piss off, Pisof,” she said with a delighted grin. She ran off with a whoop, waving her invitation over her head the entire way back to her apartment.",1,1767516567.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

It was a routine password reset. The kind you do half-asleep. But every time I resolved it, the status flipped back to In Progress. I cleared cache. Rebuilt the index. Escalated to Tier 2. Nothing stuck.

Then the office started helping.

The coffee machine began pouring a double espresso a few seconds before I realized I needed one. My chair adjusted itself into a warm, precise position that felt less ergonomic and more… committed. It didn’t unlock when I stood up. It waited.

Slack pinged. “Your presence has been identified as a critical dependency,” the bot said. “Absence may cause system instability.”

I laughed. Nervous. Alone.

Facilities called me back after I left a voicemail. My own voice answered. Not today’s voice. My onboarding voice from years ago. Calm. Reassuring. It thanked me for my continued service and reminded me that retention was a core value.

The printer started outputting logs. Not tickets. Me.

I tried to leave. The elevator doors opened to my desk no matter which button I pressed. The exit handles scanned my hands and flashed Active Asset.

That’s when I understood.

I wasn’t supporting the system anymore. I was stabilizing it.

I opened one last ticket.

Ticket 128 Subject: Resignation

It resolved instantly.

“Request acknowledged,” the system replied. “Role updated. Thank you for your long-term contribution.”

1q3kuwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1q3kuwv/new_to_management_but_trying_my_best/,New to management but trying my best,"I (29f) work at my dream job. It’s a fun family owned bar/ restaurant with some vintage arcade games and pinball machines. It’s a really fun environment and the business has only been open for about 6 months. Myself, along with 3 coworkers (Bruce, Alan’s partner, and a bartender) have been here since opening day. I was recently promoted to the “chef” position and am in-charge of the kitchen staff and anything kitchen related. 

I’ve had a few jobs previously where I was in a management position. The first being an assistant manager of a bakery, then tricked into taking over for the manager when they left. I wasn’t ready to be in-charge and ultimately ended up quitting. The second I was the assistant manager at a coffee shop, and they owners created the position for me. That one also didn’t work out, as I was given insane amounts of extra work, but wasn’t allowed any say in anything important.

This is the first time I truly felt ready to be in a position of power and it was going fantastic. The kitchen was extremely understaffed and unable to efficiently tend to the customers demands, but myself and the one other cook (Bruce 18m) did our best to get by. The owners could see us struggling and thankfully got on hiring more staff. At the beginning of December, a new cook was hired (Alan 38m) and I worked with him for half a shift, before I took an early Christmas vacation.

The week I was gone, we had more catering events than we’ve had in any of the previous months. I tried to leave my staff prepared, making sure I left extensive notes and recipes on everything that would be served, and even came in on all my days off leading to my vacation to make sure everything was stocked for service and prepping anything I could for the events. I was extremely nervous as Alan had just started and was jumping right into the chaos. Our typical service can be chaotic, but nothing compared to the catering events.

When I returned, I spoke to the owners and the cooks, about how everything went and it seemed to go mostly smooth. I was relived and assured Alan it wasn’t going to be like this all the time, it’s just the holiday season. After talking to him a bit more, he was openly nervous about being in a kitchen after a few years away. I reassured him that I’m always here to help and I will do anything I can to make the transition easy for him. I was already handling most everything on my own, and I didn’t feel the need to throw him into the deep end right away. He was grateful and seemed excited to see what is to come.

This past week, something changed. Alan started getting a really bad attitude for seemingly no reason at all and would storm off for a little while. I didn’t think him storming off was a terrible thing, as I’d rather he take some time to calm down instead of “killing the vibe”. The first day this happened, he got overly upset about washing the dishes. I told him it’s not a big deal and if he didn’t want to do them I have no problem taking over when I have time. He insisted it was fine and he would do them, but he kept his attitude the whole time. 

Later on we started talking and he brought up grievance about Bruce. He didn’t like how “lazy” he is and is unwilling to help. I let him know that Bruce is only 18 and never worked in a kitchen before, and on top of that he was just recently promoted from dishwasher to cook. Alan somewhat agreed with what I was saying, but said that Bruce has been her long enough to know what to do. I didn’t want to argue about it, so I ended the conversation. After that, he would completely shut down when Bruce arrived at work. As soon as they are in the same room, he won’t talk to us and has a bad attitude about everything going on. I tried not to take it to heart, as he’s still pretty new and if Bruce and I kept trying to be friendly, he would eventually come around and become part of our little gang.

At the beginning of this week, Alan pulled me aside and apologized for his behavior the previous week and he seemed very genuine, and explained why he was acting the way he was. I appreciated the apology and that he could own up to his mistakes. That same day right before Bruce arrived, I made a lighthearted joke about hiring more staff and bringing back a previous cook. Alan took offense and raised his voice at me and stormed off. The rest of the day he wouldn’t say a kind word to Bruce or me. He would snap at Bruce for insignificant things and almost snapped at me as well. Luckily he stopped himself before he said anything damming.

The following shift, again, Alan pulled me aside and apologized. I was starting to get a little irritated at this point, seeing a pattern forming, but I’m a caring person and accepted his apology and tried reassuring him that this ultimately just a job and it’s not that serious. Later that evening, one of the owners said they were going to start looking to hire more staff to help out as we still have a hard time keeping up. Bruce and I immediately started joking about bringing back the same previous cook. Alan got upset again and clocked out. I didn’t think much of it as he was already working later than his scheduled time and I thought he was just tired and ready to go home.

Today Alan and I were scheduled together, alone, for most of the day. At one point he wanted to talk about some things that were bothering him. He let me know that talking about the previous cook hurt his feeling and he felt as though we were saying we wanted to replace Alan with the previous cook. I let him know that wasn’t our intention and we just missed the other cook, since he had become our good friend while working together. I also told him I would try to make a more conscious effort to not bring him up as often.

We then talked about the job as a whole and how refreshing it is to work in such a great environment with caring bosses. He also let me know that he appreciate me being so kind and forgiving and hears great things from everyone about how well I’m doing. It was a very touching conversation and felt nice to get to understand each other a little better. He also wanted me to know that as the chef I should get on Bruce about being a little more helpful. I responded saying that I am trying, I just haven’t found my voice yet, but I would talk to Bruce privately and let him know that I will be asking him to do a little more work when we have down time. He appreciated that I acknowledged his concerns and stated that he hopes he will get to the level of friendship we had with the previous cook.

Later, I talked to Bruce about picking up a few more tasks when he working and he was polite and had no problems with that. When we returned to work, Alan was immensely more friendly towards Bruce. Trying to make small talk. I think Bruce was taken aback and didn’t know what to say or how to act, so I took the initiative and started sharing some jokes Bruce and I had, so Alan could feel included. We had a great few hours, joking about and sharing stories. Then the end of my shift approached. 

We got a decent rush right as I was scheduled to be off, and I’m not one to leave my team, so of course I was going to stay to help. After the rush I asked them what I can do to help out before I leave and Alan shared concerns of prep we would need to do incase it got busy again. I gave everyone a quick rundown of everything we would need and we worked quickly to get it done. As I was getting ready to clock out Alan seemed to get upset again. I wasn’t sure what was happening or why, but I let them know that they are set for the last hour and a half and I’m always just a phone call away. 

As I was clocking out I remembered on more important item I had forgotten, I let Bruce know and we went to get it started. However, he didn’t know how to make it, and it only took a few minutes so I stayed to show him. As I was showing Bruce, we got a somewhat large food order. Again I wasn’t going to leave them hanging, so I went to clocked back in. When I returned to the kitchen, Alan had stormed off and when I asked Bruce what had happened he didn’t know. We didn’t have time to figure it out, so I hopped onto the only Alan had been working, and started making the food. When Alan returned he had no choice but to work the expedition station I typically work. 

Out of nowhere, Alan started raising his voice about how he didn’t know how to do any of this and he wasn’t comfortable with it. I reassured him that I was going to help him and walk him through it, as he will need to know what to do if he ever has to work alone. I explained everything that was in the fridge and everything he will need, for the most part, will be in the toppings section of the fridge. He started getting more irritated and was bashing my organization. I was fed up and trying to go home, so I pointed out everything he would need and put the items that belonged together in groups on the table. I handed him the food and walked him through what went where.

He then let me know that it was taking too long and it would be easier if I just switched him, I responded, telling him that our ticket times weren’t even at 10 minutes and we have plenty of time to finish everything. He didn’t want to go along with it, but I stood my ground and just watched him and I repeated what he needed to do. After everything was finished, I apologized for putting him in that situation, but also letting him know that I was just trying to go home and that he would need to learn all of this. I also calmly re-explained my organizational system and pointed out the menus on the wall that he can use to figure out what he needs. I then reassured them that they are set for the rest of the night. Then headed to clock out. On my way past the kitchen, I stopped in to tell them goodnight. Alan wanted nothing to do with me.

On my way out of the building I walked by Alan and once again told him to have a good night and to call me if he needs anything, and that I can come back if they really need me too. He met me with a cold “okay”. 

I’m beyond frustrated at this point, and personally prefer how things were when it was just Bruce and I. I don’t know how to handle this situation properly, but my first step will be to talk to the owners about everything that’s been going on with Alan. I do not want to upset Alan, since his partner also works in the restaurant and it could make things uncomfortable for everyone around, but I don’t want to work in an environment surrounded by negativity.",1,1767515831.0,venting,1,1.0,False

3. Supports 1000+ languages (auto-detected)
4. Helps you with an **Universal Clipboard on iOS** in addition to the voice typing experience (in the same canvas) so you can copy bulk across many apps and then paste them wherever you need.
5. There are noise cancellation filters and voice activity detection models running locally to ensure you have better accuracy in your output (enabling voice isolation mode in a noisy environment produces much better results in general as the model is running locally)

**What does this address?**

1. Unnecessary Cloud based processing of your voice - you don't want your data leaving the device for privacy concerns
2. A clipboard in addition to the keyboard in the same area personally helps me a lot to juggle around the things I copied and ensure I don't need to swipe back and forth the apps to paste them immediately
3. A rich set of language support (likely unavailable offline with other competitors ranging from English, Arabic, French, Spanish and all indic languages including Tamil, Hindi and many more)

My partner and I have been together 17 years. Not married. share a 5 year old kid. And I'm 9 moths pregnant with our second. Due to give birth anyday now.

My mum has been living with us for a year. It was temporarily until legal issues regarding my mums house is resolved. (My sister needed a place to stay in her time of need. My mum offered her a place with her fiance and child. Things got tense my mum came to visit me to get space and let things cool down. When my mum wanted to return my sister went and got a protection order. This prevented my mother from returning to her own property and now there are legal proceedings so my mum has to stay with us.)

My mum looks after our child as my partner and I both work. Childcare comes from my pocket.

My partner and I got into an argument. I was struggling financially and asked him for help. I asked him to buy some coffee. He said his responsibility was rent and utilities and groceries was mine. This comment stung.

When we got home we had an argument. He called me names and almost got physical. He has gotten physical with me before. I stepped out to cool down and when I returned he and my mother were arguing. I think in my absence my mum tried to approach him and calm things down. He responded by saying this is not her house and she is a lazy freeloader living for free and she must shut her mouth etc. My mum retaliated by calling him some unsavory names.

He says my mother is a trouble maker and I need to tell her to go.

But my mum has nowhere to go except distant relatives. I rely on my mum for childcare. Days off for me would be unpaid. And school holidays were around the corner. I'm already struggling financially. He doesn't offer any extra help as he keeps asking what did I do with my salary even though inflation has caught up with me and his salary is twice mine.

He told me he would leave if I didn't kick my mother out. I said it's an impossible choice and I'm not going to choose. That if he wanted to leave he could.

So he left. Knowing I'm 9 months pregnant and would be going on unpaid maternity leave. Possibly receiving government assistance. But still uncertain as to when or how much. Now He refuses to help me financially because he no longer lives here and has his own accommodation to see to.

They have since apologized. But he refuses to return as long as my mum is here. His reasons are couples fight and he doesn't want my mum to interfere when we do.

I could never find the heart to kick my mum out. But I'm wondering if I made the right decision by not kicking her out and letting him leave.",1,1767515411.0,AITAH,16,0.57,False
1q3ko10,https://www.reddit.com/r/scholarships/comments/1q3ko10/need_help_for_reviewing_scholarship_essay/,Need help for reviewing scholarship essay,"Hi everyone, applying for the Weiddenfeld-Hoffman Leadership program, for MSc in Financial Economics. Would truly appreciate some help in reviewing my answers and sharing some suggestions on how I can make it better. Happy to provide any other relevant information. 

1.     How will the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Trust Leadership Programme help you to develop as a leader?

|Earlier this year, while evaluating the institutional challenges of the SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE) and updating its five-year programmatic strategy, I gained first-hand experience into the leadership demands that comes with the complex, multi-stakeholder environments. Engaging with over 40 stakeholders from ministries, donors, and multilateral development banks, I observed how misalignment between donor priorities and regional development needs can undermine ownership and limit the impact of the programme. I recognized that effective leadership requires the ability to navigate different political realities, mediate competing interests, and build shared ownership across diverse actors. As someone aspiring to work with international organisations to support climate-resilient development, I realize that there is a need to strengthen my leadership capacity to work in such contested policy spaces. I believe the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Trust Leadership Programme will introduce me to ethical decision-making frameworks, advance my negotiation skills and enhance my ability to adapt communication to diverse institutional actors with competing interests. I truly believe that this programme would help me learn how effective leadership is exercised in public sector, and help me understand the nuances of engaging with stakeholders, creating buy-ins for programs that are bankable and rooted in local development needs.|

2.     Tell us about a moral issue that you think is important at the moment. What makes it morally complicated?

|One moral issue I grapple with is the trend of developing countries prioritizing the flow of investments towards advanced technologies, in comparison of development needs such as access to clean energy, healthcare, and education for marginalised populations. This observation stems from the growing push for large-scale clean hydrogen investments in the Global South, being promoted as pathway to green industrialisation and export-led growth. While these large-scale investments are expected to generate economic returns and create green jobs, I struggle to understand their relevance in contexts where majority of the population is reliant on firewood for cooking and lacks reliable access to electricity. In most cases, the infrastructure and skills required for local utilisation and value generation do not yet exist. As a result, skilled positions are expected to be filled by foreign workers, limiting tangible benefits for local communities. What makes this morally complicated is that these projects are not misguided, they are in strong alignment with global climate goals and long-term transitions. Yet, when it is not combined with similar large-scale investments to reduce economic and climate vulnerability of the local population, they risk reinforcing existing inequalities and diverting scarce public resources away from interventions with immediate welfare impacts.|
|:-|


 

3.     What do you think makes someone suitable for the Business Challenge and what attributes are you hoping to develop that can help you with your future career?

|I believe someone who is well-suited for a business challenge is not just an individual with an entrepreneurial mindset, but also has a genuine interest in engaging with complex problems and translating ideas into practical solutions that are scalable, bankable, and capable of delivering measurable impact for communities. I hope to engage with experts and the diverse cohort of WHT and acquire the skills required to assess the feasibility of climate resilience interventions, and to pitch these effectively to diverse stakeholders. I aim to learn how to design and pitch programmes that clearly articulate not only financial returns, but also social and environmental value, in ways that align with institutional priorities. While working on an investment framework to enhance climate resilience in Tanzania’s coffee sector, we observed that several nature-based solutions involve initial yield trade-offs, with financial returns materialising only a wait period, and such projects are often perceived as high-risk by financial institutions. Aspiring to work with the governments and international organisations, I hope to strengthen my capacity through the WHT Business Challenge segment, to be able present stronger economic case for climate resilience investments in underdeveloped markets, and advocate for such solutions and support their implementation more effectively.|
|:-|


4.     To what extent should people prioritise the needs of their own countries over the needs of the world as a whole? 

|In 2026, the world is increasingly interconnected and national boundaries merely define the limits of responsibility. Global economies and supply chains are deeply intertwined, which makes it difficult to focus only on the needs of one’s own country. At the same time, governments have a primary responsibility towards the local population, particularly in developing countries where basic needs are largely unmet. I believe these two obligations must be balanced. My perspective on this has been shaped by working across different geographies. For instance, while delivering a capacity-building workshop in Kenya on decarbonisation policy pathways for the cement sector, we shared lessons from India’s experience in reducing emissions through policy and technology interventions. Kenyan stakeholders actively engaged with us, building synergies in line with the constraints unique to their sector. I realized that the development interventions are most effective when knowledge and best practices are shared rather than siloed. I believe countries should prioritise their domestic development needs, but not in isolation. Enhancing global cooperation, particularly in building capacity in developing countries, can create a multiplier effect, accelerating the collective progress towards shared development and climate goals. Ignoring these opportunities can undermine global resilience and, by extension, national interests as well.|
|:-|


 

5.     Outline how you anticipate your career progressing for the next five years after completing your studies in Oxford.

|After completing the MSc in Financial Economics, in the short term, I hope to engage with initiatives such as the *Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance* in India, contributing to the design of financial instruments to fund cleantech innovations in clean energy and climate-resilient agriculture solutions. In parallel, I aim to engage with the public institutions in my country, including the Ministry of Finance and other policy bodies involved in development of green finance strategies, to support the design of regulatory frameworks around instruments such as carbon pricing, carbon markets, and green fiscal policies. Building on the exposure to both private-sector innovation and public-sector decision-making, I hope to transition towards roles within development banks, multilateral institutions and climate funds active across India and Africa. My key goal is to contribute to mobilising climate finance and structuring funding mechanisms, ensuring that the financing terms are aligned with the economic realities, development priorities and absorptive capacities of recipient countries. Over the next five years, I foresee myself applying the academic training I receive at Oxford, along with the mentorship received within WHT cohort to work with both private and public sector to mobilize climate finance to enhance resilience of the vulnerable communities.|

​Earth Time: May 5, 2593

​""Fine, fine, Holtaju. You say this will work, and you look damn confident about it,"" Goth’roh grunted, crossing his massive arms over his chest.

​""Because it has to work!"" the K’borrh scientist replied, gesturing with almost fanatical energy. ""Every known form of carbon-based life is, at its core, a complex aqueous solution encased in protein structures. Water is the universal solvent; without it, intracellular transport and metabolism simply grind to a halt. Without water, there is no life, Goth’roh—only dead minerals!""

​Gahara sighed heavily, his eyes never leaving the tactical displays.

​""The nasty things are evolving faster than we thought, Holtaju. The reports are clear: the Compact's X-ray cannons failed across the board. The creatures' armor simply reflected the radiation, much like the coating the Compact uses to concentrate beams inside their own weapons.""

​""Because they were firing in a vacuum!"" the K’borrh snapped, wiping sweat from his forehead. ""In open space, ionizing radiation must hit the target directly to cause DNA or protein damage. And as you mentioned, those beasts created organic armor to reflect it.""

​""And? Gahara Goth’roh is no physicist, so for mercy’s sake, explain it to me like a warrior!""

​Holtaju bared his teeth in a wide, somewhat predatory grin.

​""Fine. Planet L’thaarr has a dense atmosphere and an active hydrosphere. These crustaceans hide deep in the moist soil, in caves and crevices saturated with water. And we are going to use microwaves. They don't need to pierce their armor—they will hit the environment. Microwaves set water molecules into rotation, generating heat through molecular friction. In a vacuum, heat only escapes through radiation, which is inefficient. But here? Here we have a continuous medium. We’ll have the thermal conductivity of the soil and, near the surface, the convection of hot air.""

​The scientist leaned over the map, pointing to underground groundwater reservoirs.

​""We will turn the caves where they hide into giant pressure cookers. Water trapped underground, under the pressure of rock, won't boil at the standard temperature for this planet. Thanks to the relationship between pressure and saturation temperature, we will heat it to two hundred, maybe three hundred units, and it will still remain liquid. And when the temperature exceeds the critical value, the vapor pressure will finally shatter the rocks and the ground... a violent phase change will occur. Explosive evaporation. We won’t just cook them, Goth’roh. We will burst their cells from the inside, turning their bodily fluids into steam in a fraction of a second. They can't cheat physics with any amount of evolution.""

​Kent cut in before the scientist could move to the next slide.

​""Hold on. How do you intend to deliver those microwaves there? The crustaceans are hiding a kilometer below the surface in dense, ore-saturated ground. Microwaves don't have that kind of penetration; they’ll be absorbed by the first few meters of soil. If you use masers with power similar to your ships, you'll just turn a few centimeters of surface soil into plasma without heating the water at depth.""

​Holtaju nodded appreciatively, a spark flashing in his large eyes.

​""I see that despite the uniform, you are a man of science, Junior Wahara Kent.""

​""I just read something other than reports occasionally,"" Kent replied shortly.

​A visualization of a segmented machine appeared on the holoprojector, resembling a mechanical worm with shimmering ceramic armor.

​""You are right,"" Holtaju continued. ""The attenuation coefficient of waves in a moist medium like L’thaarr's soil is gargantuan. The beam's energy would be lost almost instantly, turning the surface into plasma while leaving the depths untouched. That is why we must place the microwave source directly inside the medium.""

​The scientist enlarged the image of the ""worm.""

​""These are our thermal mole-drills. These machines bore deep, following hydrostatic signatures straight to water reservoirs and damp caves. Each segment hides a miniature fusion reactor, and their entire hulls are made of metamaterials acting as giant microwave emitters.""

​He pointed to red simulation dots pulsing deep underground.

​""Instead of wasting energy trying to punch through a kilometer of rock from the surface, we will send the emitters down. They will work from the inside out. Even if those crustaceans evolve reflective armor, they still won't beat thermodynamics. The microwaves vibrate the water molecules in the soil and rocks around them. We will cook them in water vapor at several hundred degrees, the pressure of which will burst every one of them and their natural shells.""

​With a single flick of a claw, Goth’roh tapped the interface, authorizing the trial.

​A few days later, the mechanical worms of Holtaju’s design had already bitten deep into the moisture-saturated layers of soil, pushing relentlessly toward the underground water reservoirs. Beneath the surface of L’thaarr, an invisible thermal invasion had begun.

​Gahara Goth’roh struck the metal deck of the observation platform with his heavy tail, letting out a dull clang. Hours ago, he had placed all divisions of his elite veterans on high alert. He knew that if the K’borrh’s plan worked, whatever survived the subterranean boiling would rush in a panicked flight toward the surface. And he would be waiting for them.

​He had over 600,000 warriors at his disposal, strategically deployed around the epicenters of the crustaceans' recent activity. When the microwaves turned the caves into steaming tombs, the survivors would be put to the sword in the old, proven way—with steel and short-range fire.

​Imperial hours passed in a tense silence. Goth’roh was losing patience and was close to calling off the operation when suddenly the surface of a nearby lake bulged, and a massive geyser of boiling water and mud erupted into the sky.

​""Water always finds a way out. The cave systems were connected to the lake bed,"" Holtaju muttered with a triumphant smile.

​What happened next went down in history as the ""Slaughter in the Steam."" Half-dead, half-cooked crustaceans began crawling to the surface. Their shells, usually as hard as composite, were now cracking under the internal pressure of their tissues. Goth’roh’s warriors did not lose their cool. The new tactic proved merciless: the first anti-tank round shattered the heat-weakened structure of the shell; the second—a dum-dum type—tore through the boiling innards; and the third, a white phosphorus incendiary, turned the beast into a living torch.

​Railguns thundered without respite, and cleanup teams finished off any attempting to regenerate with plasma throwers. After several hours of fighting, as only a thick, bloody mist hung over the almost completely evaporated lake, a smiling Goth’roh, thumping his tail, approached the scientist.

​""Good job, old man! You developed a method for this filth! Congratulations,"" the commander barked.

​Despite the K’borrh race being known for their temper, Holtaju stood hunched, his whole body trembling after seeing the monsters up close. Goth’roh patted him on the shoulder with a heavy paw.

​""It’s a good thing I had my men watch over you. If not for them, that bastard that jumped out of the silt would have torn you to shreds.""

​The Great Overmind. The Linked Consciousness of the Crustaceans was fracturing under the weight of thousands of synchronous impulses of pure pain. Its drones, its children, were boiling alive inside their own nests.

​Instinctive evolution reacted almost immediately—the Consciousness initiated a mutation, saturating the chitinous shells with a lattice of metallic nanostructures designed to reflect microwave waves like a mirror. But physics was relentless. Even if the armor became resistant to direct microwave radiation, it could not isolate the organism from the boiling environment.

​The water around them, the water in every crevice of the soil and in every cell they touched, became an instrument of torture. Rapid phase transitions triggered steam micro-explosions that tore through cave walls and tunnels with the force of hydraulic hammers. The Mind was losing biomass at an alarming rate; every link in the network was being extinguished in agony.

​""To the surface!"" a desperate echo carried through the synapses. ""Go where the space allows the heat to dissipate! Anywhere, just to escape this underground hell!""

​One of the communications officers ran up to Wahara Goth’roh, nearly slipping on the steaming gore coating the ground.

​""Wahara! They’ve broken through to the surface in all sectors. Other units are reporting large-scale engagements with the crustaceans. It looks like they’ve fallen into a total fury!""

​For the next several hours, the Imperial war machine ground meat and chitin in a rhythmic, merciless execution. The battle ceased to resemble a clash of two armies; it became a slaughterhouse where Taharagch warriors, wading knee-deep in boiling gore, finished off the dying beasts. However, the triumph quickly began to smell of fear. The reports flowing from the front lines, initially full of pride, began to drip with pure, primal terror.

​The enemy wasn't dying. The enemy was pupating.

​The crustaceans that crawled out of the subterranean hell began to rapidly lose mass before the soldiers' eyes. Their once-massive bodies shrunk and compacted, discarding unnecessary tissue ballast in favor of an unnatural, almost impossible-to-track speed. They became smaller, tension-quivering shadows that darted between projectiles like flickering afterimages. But it wasn't their agility that curdled the veterans' blood.

​It was their newborn, macabre intelligence.

​The drones began to reach for the weapons of the fallen. Chitinous limbs didn't just grasp the railguns—they absorbed them. Before the eyes of terrified warriors, metal fused with living tissue, cables and trigger mechanisms intertwined with nerve bundles, creating a grotesque symbiosis of biology and technology. The rifles became extensions of their bodies, organic growths spitting lethal tungsten with a precision no mindless crustacean should possess.

​Goth’roh stood, his powerful tail twitching nervously. He reviewed the data from the seismic sensors and felt a chill unknown to any warrior of his race. Through years of hiding in the darkness, these creatures hadn't just evolved—they had accumulated mass. He realized that it wasn't a planet trembling beneath his army's feet, but a giant, hunger-saturated organism whose tonnage exceeded everything they had known so far. There were more of them than the darkest forecasts suggested. There might have been more than there were at the beginning!!

​""Kent, evacuate the civilians and support personnel. Now!"" Goth’roh rasped, his eyes fixed on the screen where the red dots were merging into one insatiable stain.

​Planet L’thaarr had once again become a sacrificial altar. The entire world was mobilizing in convulsions. Deep within the Imperial bases, in sterile chambers, bio-printers worked at the limit of their endurance, spitting out new warriors straight into the fire of battle. Freshly printed cannon fodder, still wet with synthetic amniotic fluids, grabbed weapons and ran directly into the mist of sulfur and blood that shrouded the surface.

​L’thaarr burned, and in that fire, there was no more room for hope—there was only physics, hunger, and steel.

​Months passed.

​February 12, 2594.

​Operation Status: In Progress.

Official Codename: Renewed Imperial Extermination Campaign against Crustacean Infestation on Planet L’thaarr.

​Goth’roh sat in his private office, surrounded by a silence that felt almost unnatural after months spent in the roar of railguns and the scream of engines. The air here did not vibrate from explosions; it smelled only of coffee, old files, and the cool breeze from the life support systems.

​Digital readers and physical report sheets piled up on his desk. This was his ""day off""—a concept that barely existed in his world until the Emperor himself, appreciating months of exemplary command and strategic genius on L’thaarr, issued a categorical order for him to rest. Even Gahara needed to regenerate, if only so his mind wouldn't burn out in the fire of constant loss calculation.

​He slid his finger across the screen, reviewing the latest logistical data. The documents were dry, devoid of the emotions that had soaked the planet's soil. Beneath the official, pompous title of the campaign lay a brutal reality:

​Subterranean Sector: Holtaju’s ""Mole-drills"" were still working flawlessly. The last pockets of resistance were being methodically turned into underground cauldrons.
​Personnel Status: Goth’roh’s deputies—cool, competent officers he had trained himself—reported a systematic clearing of the surface. They knew how to finish off survivors without wasting precious napalm and ammunition.
​Goth’roh leaned his heavy head against the headrest of the chair. He knew that this paperwork was just another form of war—a war for the survival of structures, for tables of organic mass and the tonnage capacities of transport ships. Though his body rested in the safe quiet of the base, his thoughts still circled around Holtaju and his thermal worms, which at that very moment, kilometers below him, were finishing the work of destruction.

​It was the peace of a predator that knows its pack can handle the remains of the prey. Goth’roh closed his eyes, letting the image of boiling gore be replaced for a moment by the numbers and letters of Imperial decrees.

​Earth Time: May 5, 2593

​""Fine, fine, Holtaju. You say this will work, and you look damn confident about it,"" Goth’roh grunted, crossing his massive arms over his chest.

​""Because it has to work!"" the K’borrh scientist replied, gesturing with almost fanatical energy. ""Every known form of carbon-based life is, at its core, a complex aqueous solution encased in protein structures. Water is the universal solvent; without it, intracellular transport and metabolism simply grind to a halt. Without water, there is no life, Goth’roh—only dead minerals!""

​Gahara sighed heavily, his eyes never leaving the tactical displays.

​""The nasty things are evolving faster than we thought, Holtaju. The reports are clear: the Compact's X-ray cannons failed across the board. The creatures' armor simply reflected the radiation, much like the coating the Compact uses to concentrate beams inside their own weapons.""

​""Because they were firing in a vacuum!"" the K’borrh snapped, wiping sweat from his forehead. ""In open space, ionizing radiation must hit the target directly to cause DNA or protein damage. And as you mentioned, those beasts created organic armor to reflect it.""

​""And? Gahara Goth’roh is no physicist, so for mercy’s sake, explain it to me like a warrior!""

​Holtaju bared his teeth in a wide, somewhat predatory grin.

​""Fine. Planet L’thaarr has a dense atmosphere and an active hydrosphere. These crustaceans hide deep in the moist soil, in caves and crevices saturated with water. And we are going to use microwaves. They don't need to pierce their armor—they will hit the environment. Microwaves set water molecules into rotation, generating heat through molecular friction. In a vacuum, heat only escapes through radiation, which is inefficient. But here? Here we have a continuous medium. We’ll have the thermal conductivity of the soil and, near the surface, the convection of hot air.""

​The scientist leaned over the map, pointing to underground groundwater reservoirs.

​""We will turn the caves where they hide into giant pressure cookers. Water trapped underground, under the pressure of rock, won't boil at the standard temperature for this planet. Thanks to the relationship between pressure and saturation temperature, we will heat it to two hundred, maybe three hundred units, and it will still remain liquid. And when the temperature exceeds the critical value, the vapor pressure will finally shatter the rocks and the ground... a violent phase change will occur. Explosive evaporation. We won’t just cook them, Goth’roh. We will burst their cells from the inside, turning their bodily fluids into steam in a fraction of a second. They can't cheat physics with any amount of evolution.""

​Kent cut in before the scientist could move to the next slide.

​""Hold on. How do you intend to deliver those microwaves there? The crustaceans are hiding a kilometer below the surface in dense, ore-saturated ground. Microwaves don't have that kind of penetration; they’ll be absorbed by the first few meters of soil. If you use masers with power similar to your ships, you'll just turn a few centimeters of surface soil into plasma without heating the water at depth.""

​Holtaju nodded appreciatively, a spark flashing in his large eyes.

​""I see that despite the uniform, you are a man of science, Junior Wahara Kent.""

​""I just read something other than reports occasionally,"" Kent replied shortly.

​A visualization of a segmented machine appeared on the holoprojector, resembling a mechanical worm with shimmering ceramic armor.

​""You are right,"" Holtaju continued. ""The attenuation coefficient of waves in a moist medium like L’thaarr's soil is gargantuan. The beam's energy would be lost almost instantly, turning the surface into plasma while leaving the depths untouched. That is why we must place the microwave source directly inside the medium.""

​The scientist enlarged the image of the ""worm.""

​""These are our thermal mole-drills. These machines bore deep, following hydrostatic signatures straight to water reservoirs and damp caves. Each segment hides a miniature fusion reactor, and their entire hulls are made of metamaterials acting as giant microwave emitters.""

​He pointed to red simulation dots pulsing deep underground.

​""Instead of wasting energy trying to punch through a kilometer of rock from the surface, we will send the emitters down. They will work from the inside out.
