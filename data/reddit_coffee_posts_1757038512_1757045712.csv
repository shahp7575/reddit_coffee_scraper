I often read about how the acidity of coffee demineralizes and wears down tooth enamel. But what I don't understand:

Does the enamel merely demineralize, and then **remineralize** fully afterwards if I don't brush it or eat anything else? Or does the enamel wear down permanently?

I want a perfume that makes you fall in love like YSL’s opium, but can’t invest in another one now. I like Elizabeth Andre’s collection.

1n8vb7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1n8vb7s/hostile_work_environment/,Hostile Work Environment 🫠,"I left a job seven months ago because the supervisor was passive aggressive and was a mess all around- unorganized, stretched too thin, and full of shit. I would get emails that were incredibly patronizing, and after voicing specific concerns to HR my confidentiality was violated. It was a mess and I was so relieved to quit.

I then started at a long term care facility and was told that the department I'd be director of would consist of only me. The program was, ""basically nonexistent"", and ""whatever you do will be fine"". I was given an office filled with garbage, open food containers, mouse turds, and a laptop covered with nail polish and coffee splatters. It took me a month but I cleaned the entire office and organized everything I could. I created a well rounded program and began to see attendance increase, and get close to the residents I worked for.

The administrative team was always... odd? They were loud, constantly spoke over each other, and were incredibly harsh when others made mistakes or disagreed with their opinions. I kept my head low and stayed quiet and tried to stay in my lane. However, in the past week I've become the new target. 

I don't need to go into details, but today I came home and sobbed for a good ten minutes in my car. I felt sick to my stomach after being told in front of the team that residents were complaining about me and ""wanting something different"". This is after I've tried to coordinate with various volunteers and being told, ""I'll have to think about it"" from the administrator. This is after I was told we couldn't use the outdoor patio unless I ask permission and have extra nursing staff with me. This is after I was told I couldn't take residents on outings.

I've brought in a greenhouse who donated time and resources to do a planting workshop, added weekly craft sessions, scheduled more activities throughout the days, spent times playing games and visiting in community areas, and regularly reached out to bed bound residents when before they had little to no recreation. Compared to the last director who had Bingo twice a week, coloring, and movies the rest of the time? I thought I was doing pretty well.

But this past week the administrative team has been picking at everything I do in our morning and afternoon meetings. They ask if the residents are even having fun, why I don't take people outside, if I have anything good planned for the day. And it's not done in a professional, 1:1 conversation- it's approached like public shaming. It becomes very nasty, and another staff member in the meeting even pointed out it was ""let's passive aggressively talk about you day"". 

I needed to vent. Even if no one reads this. Because it sucks when you thought you were doing an okay job, and then you get torn down in front of your peers without being told how you can possibly improve. I have an interview somewhere new tomorrow- fingers crossed the pay cut won't be too intense, and it's a good fit. Because I truly wasn't built to survive this type of work environment.

Healthy relationships take care and attention. 

This weekend, how do you plan to or think you can intentionally care for your relationships? Consider taking time to get a cup of coffee with a friend Saturday morning or get your family together to do a much-needed chore around the house. Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger. 

In the comments below, share your goals for relationship care, ask for help coming up with ideas, or just share how you feel about devoting your time and energy to caring for the important people in your life.

1n8v96z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1n8v96z/hydrangea_part_1/,Hy-drangea Part 1,"1 Peter 2:25 

“For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered"" 



Stars, I want to see the stars. So so badly. The Babylonians used this ivory prison to convert units to calculate the movement of celestial bodies. The Chinese used the stars to keep time. The Egyptian pyramids were carefully aligned to stars. Religions based on stars, masses of people looking at the stars, using stars. But they’re probably not real anyway.



I slouched back into my chair, head tilting back, I let out a sigh. Looking over at the red blaring clock. 9:50PM it read.



 “Shit” I muttered, it takes me 6 minutes to get home.



I shot up, threw my notebook in my bag, and headed towards the exit. I scanned my card on the way out and heard the automatic “Thannnnks stop-ping in, Mich eelle”. I rushed down the street, fast walking over the plastic trash, trying not to trip. Hood up. Head down. Looking at no one. 



“The end is near” someone shouted.



Little do they know the end has long gone and passed.



I scanned my key card on the building entrance,”Wel comee H-me M-ichel”, taking a breath as I stepped inside and headed up the stairs. A rust looking substance dripped down the walls, shoes banging on the steel grated stair case. I pushed open a metal door labelled 13. Passing by graffiti covered door after door, it reads “Heaven on Earth” over and over. I turned down my hall. The carpet was mushy, the lights casting yellow hue over everything.



I pushed open the door to the townhouse.



“Have fun being the only one at the library all day? Reading your esoteric star books?” Ryan teased and threw me a vial. He was lounging on the couch with God knows who, three women and one man.



“Yeah yeah, don't have too much fun” I winked.  



I dug my notebook out of my bag, throwing the bag on my bed and the notebook on my desk. I held up the vial. A mesmerizing periwinkle hue of thick liquid. It's like the flower, the rarer the color the better the quality. Oh Hy-drangea, you beautiful thing you. “Heaven on Earth” they spout. I made a cup of green tea and attached my mouth piece to the vial and huffed. Feeling it dissipate into my lungs. 



Euphoria, bliss, a hug from a loved one crept over me. I melted.



I sat in my chair, sipped my tea and stared out the window, head on my knees. There isn't anything to really look at. Just concrete buildings. The turrets are on now, shooting anyone who is left on the street past 10:00PM until 7AM. And here I am watching people get absolutely torn to shreds. Red covers the streets. Fully autonomous cities. Pollution has encased the sky because of the many autonomous factories. Creating an almost night during the day. That's when I saw it, a glimmer. I hopped up to try to look closer but I think I was imagining it, I don't know, maybe it's the high. I sighed and layed down on my bed. 



Stars



I want to see stars so badly, if they're even real. Apparently, according to books, people used to study stars, map them out, and had what was called “astrological signs”. But people don't care about that anymore, they don't care about much of anything. Only the people who shout things like “The end is near” care, and only partially. Hy-drangea took that from us, it took humanity, curiosity, everything “Heaven on Earth”. But it's so good to not care. The botanists developed it that way, if the botanists are even real. I've never met a single person who was like “I’m a botanist”  and it's not like a thing to hide, if anything you would be worshiped. Apparently they used to patrol us, watch us. But not anymore, if a crime is committed then it is what it is just take the cure all, Hy-drangea. 



The sea

 

They used the stars to map out travel too. I want to see the sea too. If that's even real also.



I eventually fell asleep and was woken by screaming. 8AM the clock read. I huffed and rolled my eyes getting out of the bed. I crept out of the room, Ryan and the strangers still passed out on the couch, clothes half on. I softly opened the front door and stuck my head out looking down the hall towards the screaming.



A man was dragging a woman by her hair down the hall, a trail of fresh blood seeping into the already damp carpet, she was squirming, almost wiggling like a worm you just plucked from the soil. I squinted and noticed her head was split open. Her skin peeled back around and I noticed “Bitch” was written onto her bare skull. The man noticed me and shouted “Mind yours”. I softly shut the door, grabbed a vial off the table, retreated back to my room and proceeded to get ready to go to the library. 



Ryan was awake by the time I was about to head out. 



“Are we still meeting with April at the cafe later?” He asked. 



I nodded and headed out. 



“Se  e you lat er Mechhhhhhhhelle” the voice said as I slid my key card to go out. I made my way towards the library head down, avoiding falling on the trash and what were people yesterday that are now flesh masses littering the street. 



“Wel come t- the libra  ry Miche  lle” said the voice.



I put my bag down, a little too hard as it echoed through the emptiness of the desks that are falling apart. Went over to the “Religion” section, scanning the books. I pulled one called “The Bible” , I sat down, pulled my note book out and started studying. Apparently people used to go by this book, and had a whole buildings dedicated to it. I think that building next to one of the food distribution centers on 13th street used to be one. The stained glass windows, once probably beautiful, are busted out. Trees growing inside.



 God created the stars, and has a name for all. God made the sun, moon, and stars to provide light to the Earth.



God has long since abandoned us…. or is it the reserve? Who cares anyway. 



I swiped my key card 



“Se e you  ne  xxxxxxt tim elle”



I entered the cafe, weeds and vines growing all through. A giant poster reading “Heaven on Earth” I went to the vendor and swiped my card “On  e cofe for Mich ell e” Said the voice. A conveyor with a cup of coffee slowly made its way towards me, the belts screeching. I picked it up and sat down. Staring down at my coffee looking at the bubbles of the oily residue sitting on top. 



“Uh hey Michelle are you there?” asked Ryan, swiping his hand in front of my face. I snapped out of it. April was already sitting with a cup of coffee. Ryan sat down with his.



“I want to leave,” I said, taking a sip.



“Huh?” Asked April. Both of them looked at me confused. 



“I want to see the stars”



“Holy moly this again” Ryan said rolling his eyes “Have you heard what goes on outside the walls?”



I have, they say that it's worse than inside, there's not a decent supply of Hy-Drangea out there. People are fiending for it so badly that they've turned feral. Packs like wolves, ripping each other apart and feasting on the remains. But who knows, no one really leaves cause why would they, they don’t care enough. 



“Those are just rumors and you're not going to change my mind, besides I’m leaving no matter what, just wanted to let you both know”



“We’re coming with you” April stated.



“Oh my God” exclaimed Ryan and threw his hands up “I guess I’ll go get us some vials to last a few weeks and to barter with” 



I smiled.

My usual day off, usually off by myself because my husband has to work, usually late. 
On Wednesday mornings I mentally begin to plan my day off whether that’s deep-cleaning, running errands, taking a workout class, having a rest day, etc. This Wednesday afternoon my husband calls me to tell me he has good news and bad news. The bad news is he has to work on Saturday, (the only day off we both have and get to spend together) but would have Thursday off. He’d still have to go to work towards the evening though. Okay cool, even though we haven’t spent a full day together since we got back from our vacation two weeks ago. Mentally rearranged my day, let him know some things I had in mind that I wanted to do that he could join me. Thursday morning, it’s 10am and I’m brushing my teeth and getting ready for the day. He’s out grabbing something for us then getting coffee and comes home about half an hour later. He’s on the phone dealing with work or something for the rest of the morning, on a call or texting. Didn’t get to go shopping, to the gym, or take a walk. We did get to go to the library two blocks away, which was the main thing I wanted to do. Before he leaves for work, I tell him I’m going to be deep cleaning the apartment because I hadn’t done so since before we went away on vacation three weeks ago. By now it’s 5pm. I text him at 8:30 that I finally finished but now have to take a long shower and wash my hair, and then cook dinner for us afterwards. He says he’ll do the laundry on his next day off. He gets home at 11:30, after finally finishing prepping my ingredients and starting to put the rice on the stove that will take 45minutes to cook. It is not odd for us to eat dinner late since we he gets home late almost every day. He pulls out a bowl and milk and says he’s gonna have cereal for dinner. I got frustrated and told him I wish he would’ve told me he wasn’t planning on eating dinner because I wouldn’t have spent half an hour prepping and trying to make a nice dinner, I would’ve made something quick for just myself, since I’m already tired from cleaning the entire house by myself. (He’s vegan btw). Especially because I won’t be home tomorrow night and am going to visit my parents without him so I won’t be eating dinner at home for the next two nights probably, so making a full dinner that would’ve sustained the two of us for two nights (4 servings worth) just feels like a waste of my time. I told him he could’ve told me he wasn’t gonna have dinner when I told him I was gonna shower and then cook. I even texted him after my shower before I started cooking and he didn’t mention anything. Now it’s 11:45pm and I’m making dinner for 1. Now he’s annoyed that I’m annoyed. AIO?",1,1757044726.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I have been studying Finnish at the local kansalaisopisto for 2.5 years. My speaking ability is minimal, because we don’t actually learn to speak and converse in class. I’m pretty good at writing and reading, but my conversational skills suck. 

When having coffee with a Finnish friend yesterday, she suggested we have a chat in Finnish! I said great - just please speak slowly and give me a chance to respond. I still have *very little* experience in chatting. 

She did speak slowly, which I appreciated, but then she would not give me a chance to find the words and eek them out. She kept completely my sentences. I said, “Please - let me try to get the words out!”  She got huffy and said she was only trying to help.

Somebody please care.,"About three years ago I was working in corrections. But this point I was in that field for almost five years, so I was seasoned. I was locked in a facility for 10+ hours per day. The environment was pretty grim - no windows (where I would work), only under fluorescent lights, concrete walls all around that would echo every single noise. So if an inmate on the pod adjacent to where I was decided to have a day and spend most of my 10 hours mule kicking the door and screaming, I heard every bit of it. During the winter months, I would go in before the sun came up and I would leave when the sun was already down, so I would have four straight days without any sunlight. So to save my sanity, I was hammering those Celsius energy drinks like it was nothing. That and coffee multiple times a day. I realized it was becoming a problem so I stopped all energy drinks and only drank coffee. So of course, I started doing that in an unhealthy way as well. I ended up getting a new job where I could work from home so I had a lot more control over my environment. I’d wake up with a huge mug (multiple cups worth) of coffee (even if I wasn’t tired), I’d have another huge mug after lunch, and then often times a small amount after dinner. Sometimes I’d tack on an extra one at night time in case I wanted to stay up. Needless to say, it was a problem. 

Then two years ago I took a trip to Japan for my friend’s bachelor party for a couple weeks. A huge 13 hour time difference rocked my circadian rhythm, but not as bad as everyone else. We would always wake up at 5am due to the jet lag and just get our day started. The ritual was everyone would hunt for a coffee shop that was open that early. The excitement of being in such a new place and the fact that my body was convinced it was night time due to the time difference made me not really feel the need to drink coffee. I decided to just skip out on coffee for those two weeks. 

But you saw the title so you can do the math. My wife and I welcomed our first baby 14 months ago. I didn’t drink any coffee during this entire time. Two years later, I still haven’t had any coffee. I do drink tea, but the caffeine content is day and night difference, or in some instances, there’s no caffeine at all. Not sure if I’m ever going to return to it or not. I feel like once it becomes part of a daily ritual it’s just setting the stage for revolving your entire life around it. 

Unfortunately I’m now the weirdo who asks for tea when everyone is ordering coffee, or the weirdo who brings his own tea bags to places, but I’m proud of this accomplishment. I don’t know where else to celebrate it, but I wanted to share. Somebody please care.",32,1757043587.0,daddit,14,0.86,False

Guys I am fuming. Today morning my husband placed a blinkit order. He was so excited because this order came with a free coffee cup. I was in the other room getting my children ready for school when the delivery arrived and he went off to open the box . The next thing I heard was my husband yell expletives. I came out just in time to see a grey fireball literally fly and dive into the lower crevices of my sofa. 

I died, got resurrected (because kids have to go to school), contacted their most useless customer service and died again just because of the sheer stress of this situation. A warehouse, storing perishables, has a vermin problem?! It’s a health hazard!! 

We have cctv footage and also videos of the society staff capturing the rat. Now that we have the item, do you think they will accept a return and refund? Maybe not, considering it’s slightly damaged.

But in all seriousness, I have had so many rotten and questionable perishable items delivered to my house. This takes the cake. I want to take serious actions against them, now  that it is clear that there is an actual health hazard in the warehouse.

She has multiple credit cards maxed out and she just signed up for another one. Every weekend she goes out to parties, buys expensive dresses, and eats at fancy restaurants. Sometimes she even tries to pressure me to join her, but I’ve learned my lesson from my previous roommate and I just don’t. I like going out sometimes, but I can’t spend money I don’t have.

It’s hard living with her because she doesn’t listen when I tell her to slow down. I’ve tried talking to her multiple times about not spending so much and not going to so many parties, but she just ignores me. She even complains if I don’t come along sometimes, which can be stressful.

I’ve been careful with my own money. I use debit cards that build credit instead of credit cards. That way I am only spending money I actually have, but I am still slowly building my credit for future things like renting an apartment or buying a car. It has been working really well for me. I cook my own meals, make coffee at home, and walk to campus instead of paying for rides. I also keep track of what I spend and save a little every month.

Living with her has taught me a lot about managing money and setting boundaries. I’ve realized I can’t control her choices, and I have to focus on what works for me.

1n8un7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1n8un7o/recurring_bv_yeast/,Recurring BV & Yeast,"Hello! (24F) Here! 👋🏼

I had recurring BV and Yeast for almost a year. To this day I never found the root cause/issue for it coming back. First time started with BV, and then it turned to yeast in the same month. I took a Monistat 1 (which btw, never ever do 1, save yourself and do 3 or 7) it quite literally nuked my vagina. Hurt so bad and itched like hell. But the yeast infection cleared up, yet it was obvious I had BV, the smell was so fishy. 😖

-For some context, I had just started birth control when it all started happening, and I started seeing a new partner- 👥❤️

Well anyways I decided to go to planned parenthood to get looked at because i didn’t have health insurance, and they prescribed me to metronidazole pills for a full 7 days, and a fluconazole for after. I did the full dose and took the fluc, and everything cleared up. Two weeks later- I got another yeast infection. Which then turned back into BV and so on and so forth. Every month was the same issue with the same antibiotics i was taking to treat it. 💔

‼️I can say that the only thing that has helped me thus far is taking boric acid suppositories after sex, treating my partner (male) with 7 day metronidazole (while abstaining from sex), taking 2 weeks every night of a probiotic suppository (unscented) and getting on a 6 month treatment AFTER the probiotic suppositories of 0.75 metro gel 2x a week, as well as fluconazole 200mg 1 time per week for 6 months. I also use PH test strips every once in a while to keep track of any imbalances.‼️

It has been 3 months in to my 6 month treatment and I haven’t had any of the same symptoms or a flare up. I think there was one day where I got in my head that i smelled fishy but the next day it was gone. and i’ve had sex a few times. (Same partner btw).✅🤩

Because of this HORRIBLE ordeal, I have since started taking a pleathera of vitamins and probiotics. The ones i use that i have seen an actual change is>

💊Healthy V - Women’s Prebiotic/Probiotic, 💊Oil of Oregano supplements, 💊Love Wellness - Healthy V Vitamin (Garlic), and 💊Love Wellness Boric acid suppositories. 

I don’t use any scented washes (only water down there & no douching), I don’t even put fabric softener or scented detergent in my laundry, I rarely wear tight clothing or thongs, I wear boxers or no undies to bed, and I also make sure everything is cleansed before touching myself or having sex with my partner! 

I do consume a decent amount of sugar, in my coffee, snacks and such, which i’ve heard can feed the yeast in your microbiome if there’s an over growth, so i’d be careful and cut down on sugar and bread etc… while taking any treatment, just so your microbiome can start to replenish itself. 🍞☕️

If you don’t see any progress and you’re doing kinda what i’m doing, i heard the overgrowth of bacteria you have in your vagina could be resistant to specific antibiotics, or there MIGHT be a different issue. So please go see a gynecologist if you can first and foremost! Ask to have a microbiome test done.❕

Good luck my loves! Being a vagina owner definitely sucks sometimes! lol.

PS: I do want to add- just because I was also confused 😵‍💫- that when i was taking the metro gel, i saw this white shedding that appeared to be similiar to yeast infection clumpy discharge, WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE. My doctor told me that you shed while taking the metro gel and as long as it doesn’t come with any other symptoms such as pain, itch, and smell- that it was okay.

Around the same time I did a blood test, I came across a tweet (an X?) from someone saying that switching from espresso to filtered coffee basically removed his high cholesterol issues.

Turns out coffee oils contain ""diterpenes"" called cafestol and kahweol, and these things directly raise your bad cholesterol. Apparently they are some of the most potent cholesterol-raising compounds across all foods. And here’s the kicker: paper filters trap those oils almost completely. Pour-over, AeroPress, drip with paper basically prevents these from getting into your coffee cup.

I realized I’d been drinking French press daily for years thinking I was being healthier than grabbing a latte, when in reality I was giving myself a cholesterol bump every morning. The only brew format I've touched in the last few months is the AeroPress with paper filter. You could also put a paper filter in your portafilter.

I’m moving out of my current place and looking for a new housemate to take over my room.   


**Bedroom Size:** Largest bedroom with great natural lighting. Huge closet. There is plenty of space for a queen bed, a dresser, a bookshelf, and a desk.

**Rent:** $1,550

**Availability:** 09/08/2025

**Utilities included:** water, heat and 1 parking spot included

**Basement:** laundry, dryer, trash

**Layout:** 2 bedrooms, full bathroom, open living/dining room, kitchen, and balcony

**Location:** Great location for commuting. You are a few minutes walk to the green line stop for Magoun Station. A 20 minute walk to Davis Square or Porter Square. The 80, 88, 89, 90 and 93 bus lines are a short walk from the apt. There is the community bike path that runs all the way to Alewife and Lechmere which is just off of Magoun Station. We have a quiet and safe neighborhood with several spots for local coffee, the farmers markets, restaurants and bars.



**Who we’re looking for and about your roommate:**

Looking for a clean female housemate who is in school or a young professional. Must be okay living with a dog. There is a sweet lab that lives in the apt, most of the time you wouldn’t know he is there. Unfortunately, the landlord only allows one pet.  

My housemate is really great. She’s very accommodating, friendly, and easy to get along with. Living with her is low-key, and if you want a relaxed vibe, she’s definitely worth considering!

But then the constipation started. At first I was going in very small portions then none at all. I started taking laxatives like miralax and suppositories (painfully enough) but nothing was working. Sometimes they would loosen it up a little bit but not much would come out. I surprisingly wasn’t feeling much pain in the abdominal region but more so in my bootyhole (which could very well have been from the straining but I’m not sure) I also wasn’t eating much because I was so full of shit (literally) that I would get sick to my stomach if I ate too much. I eventually got a hold of some magnesium citrate and it actually REALLY worked. I thought it had cleared me out entirely and everything would go back to normal. it did not. A couple days go by and I’m still constipated and I’ve been taking magnesium citrate because I don’t want to get too impacted or anything but it’s like I’m in this chronic state of constipation. I did have a diet switch recently so it could very well be that but I’ve been taking fiber supplements just in case and it’s not really working. The only thing that’s kind of helping me rn is coffee. And I would preferably not like to take anymore magnesium citrate cuz that stuffs borderline disgusting. If any of you know what this is lmk thanks ",1,1757042637.0,Constipation,5,0.99,False

For some context, I recently moved to Seattle, WA from St. Pete, FL, where I'm from. I'm 23F and have worked as a barista the past 3 and a half years or so. I have my Associate's and pretty much dropped out during my Bachelor's of Environmental Science and Policy at USF. I couldn't keep up financially or mentally anymore. I have about a year left in that degree, and truly want to finish it, but need to find a drive again for school (and figure out which school to go to in the first place). 

I am reaching a boiling point with being a barista. I work downtown at a coffee place within a busy hospital that has unfortunately become a high-incident and unpredictable store due to the unhoused community residing in that area. In a nutshell it has really begun to affect my mental health and although I love many aspects of it, I feel I have outgrown this job in general. My dream is to be a park ranger, or something bigger like U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or maybe even NOAA. I have thought about volunteering or doing one of those temporary jobs with the NPS where you stay in another state with room and board, etc. I have just been feeling very lost while I gain my footing in a new state and don't know where to start. It's nice experience to have under my belt, but I do not want to continue in the service industry.

If you've read all of this, thank you. I truly don't mean for this to be a sob story if it sounds like one, lol. I appreciate any guidance for those with experience with these feelings and/or careers. I want to find my drive again.

You enter a small apartment and the first thing that hits you is the smell of drainage coming from the toilet. There is no window in said toilet, so you kinda have to take it all in. 

In the living room you find the signature IKEA lamps, IKEA coffee tables and IKEA sofa  paired with some nice IKEA pillows. Which, by the way, is also where two of you will be sleeping tonight, as this 2 bed apartment is actually a double bed and a sofa bed.

Speaking of beds - there they are! The obligatory human hairs left on the bed or mattress (or both, if you're lucky). You search for bed sheets, but all you can find is more IKEA pillows. Your sofa now has 15 of them. 

The smell is becoming unbearable so you open every window in the apartment. 

Maybe a shower will fix it and freshen you up, right after you've cleaned the hairs left in the tub, of course.

As you are finally ready to fall asleep, while simultaneously trying to not think about the 3 other people that slept in the same linen as you, you start to realize that MAYBE, just MAYBE, Hotels aren't such a bad investment after all.

Ive struggled with body image for probably 5-6 or so years now, and I've finally had enough. My body def isn't horrible, but I've always known I can be better. I weigh (I think) about 160-165 lbs, and am about 5'9 or 5'10 as a female. I want to get down to about 140-135, or at the very least, appear slimmer. I honestly don't really care about the number on the scale as long as I get smaller, ya know.  
I've calculated that my maintenance is about 2200 cals/day, so I've decided to go into a deficit to about 1800. I'm making changes in my diet that includes mostly eating more whole foods and veggies, and less ultra processed foods, and less sugar. I've also been tracking my protein and aim for about 90-100g per day. I also only really ever drink water, sometimes a coffee or tea here and there— no soda or anything like that.  
As for exercising, I do a 30 min activity every single day; at home pilates 3x per week, and then an incline treadmill walk every other day. I usually get about 7000 steps per day.  
If there's anyone here who's very knowledgable about weight loss and has any tips for me, please let me know! I've tried to do as much research as I can, but I'm sure there are things that I've missed. If anyone has advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated :)",0,1757042501.0,loseit,3,0.33,False
1n8uimp,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1n8uimp/my_boyfriend_of_5_years_cheating_on_me_the_last_2/,My boyfriend of 5 years cheating on me the last 2 months of our relationship and I don’t know what to do (sorry this is so long there’s a lot to unpack),"I’ve been with my ex boyfriend for 5 years. We met when we were both 19 in 2020 and were 9 months apart. I’m not 24(F) and he’s turning 25 in a couple days. 

Long story but I found out my bf hacked into my social media accounts (snap,discord, TikTok, emails,etc.) for over 2 years and I had no idea. When I found this out I went through his phone to delete all my stuff and passwords of his phone. While doing this I found his hookup list in his notes app where I found out that I was girl 19/20. I asked him what this was and he swore to me that the list was not in order, and that he never cheated on me and swore to me a million times it was true. Fast forward I took a mental image of girl 20/20 on the hook up lists name in my head, and ended up finding her Snapchat and asked her myself if it was true if he cheated on me with her. 

Surprise surprise, she admitted everything and told me they’ve been hanging out for months and went on lunch and coffee dates and car hang outs together. I asked her if they did anything physical and she said they had sex in her car once (it was actually twice but could even be more than that) near my bday in June 🥲. She told me she felt super guilty which made me sick to my stomach, since she knew about me the whole time and knew he had a gf. But she apparently “seduced him to have sex with her”. When I confronted my ex about this he denied everything and told me she was lying even tho I had the proof of her msging me confessing everything on my phone. We ended up calling her together and she still confessed over the phone that it was true and he still continued to deny it. After arguing back and forth for 45 mins he finally admitted that he indeed did sleep with her but only once and that he was drunk and it was a huge mistake that he regretted instantly. 

The next day I asked for the truth of how many times it really happened cuz I didn’t fully believe him, since he’s been off work for 2 months and I’ve been working two jobs so barely saw him. He then admitted that he actually slept with her twice, even tho he said it was a one time mistake. I asked then how was it a mistake u regretted if u went back for seconds and u weren’t drunk the second time. 

For backstory me and my ex were having a lot of issues back when this cheating started. He was cheated on in the past so he had a lot of anxiety and insecurity issues and at times was jealous of me. This is also why he said he hacked into all my socials without me knowing, so he could see if I was up to no good. He never fully trusted me since the start cuz of this even tho I was always loyal,
so I always had to be extra careful with my words and actions so I felt like I could never be myself. Example I said that I loved the weeknd when I went to the concert and he got super offended and mad at me. It felt at times i couldn’t be myself and had to walk on eggshells because he was sensitive and would get upset, but I loved him so i didn’t mind. He also had a history of being impatient with me and has snapped at me or yelled at me at family events when he was hungry or if I made a joke he didn’t like. Have you we’ve been together for 5 years so we got to used to eachother and to comfortable at times cuz our honeymoon phase was definitely over. This caused a huge disconnection between us and we were fighting almost every week since I got home from my 2 week vacation with my girls the month before the cheating started. I also worked two jobs (60+ hours weekly) so I barely saw him and when I did I was so exhausted and drained I barely had energy to give to him like he did for me. This created a huge disconnection between us and at times I was too exhausted to be intimate and he has a high sex drive. 

Cuz of all this when I caught him he told me he went to this girl originally just to be her friend and to get “therapy/relationship advice” from her, but one thing lead to the other and they ended up having sex. And he wanted to recreate that spark her use to have with me with her but it didn’t end up working so he stopped after 2 times. He also thought I was planning on leaving him which is also why he did this, but after every fight I’ve always ended it with I love u and even tho it’s hard rn I’m not leaving you I wanna fix this cuz I only want you in the end and no one else. 

Once I heard this I blamed myself for everything. I still do tbh it felt like it was all my fault. I didn’t love him enough, I let other life issues I had get the best of me and wasn’t giving him my all cuz I got distracted by every other stress in my life that didn’t matter, I wasn’t giving him enough sex, I wasn’t giving him the attention and love he needed and deserved. 


I still feel this way which is why I still feel guilty, and Ik he says it’s a mistake and I must say he’s very remorseful and sorry and he even started therapy to fix himself cuz he wants to get back together. My family and friends hate him so idk how I could go back, but also idk if I could trust him again cuz of all the lies and times he was deceiving. I’m going from depressed sad to angry to happy. I feel insane and don’t know what to do. I miss him so much he was my best friend and we did everything together for 5 years. and still love him so much I can’t hate him if I tired. In 5 years we built up so much for our future together, I really thought this was my soulmate and the man would end up with. We were even supposed to get engaged in 2026 cuz we talked about it and I found the note of how he was planning our trip to Italy and what ring he was buying me for our engagement next year. I love his family so much too they became my own. 

I feel lost I can barely function like i used to I feel like a huge part of me died and our future together did too. This is so painful I feel like it wasn’t supposed to end like this and I’m part to blame but idk what to do. I love him so so much I still consider my best friend and hate seeing him heartbroken too. I wish this never happened so we could just go back,  and I see how sorry he is and wishes he could take it back but idk what to do. Especially cuz I still love him and worked so hard to be with him cuz I truly saw my life with him. But idk what to do now cuz there’s no guarantee if I take him back that this won’t happen again since I forgave him. I feel like after this happened he realized what he lost and we have potential to be back stronger and better than ever. But Ik that might just be a façade. Ik I prob sound crazy or delusional I’m just so sad, betrayed, and heartbroken and just miss and love him so much and wish this never happened so we could stay together.

Hey everyone! I’ll be in NYC on October 17. I’ve been to the city many times, so I’m not looking for the usual tourist stuff. Instead, I’m after experiences that feel very “only-in-NYC-right-now” — things that in a couple of years I’ll be able to say, “I did/saw/tried that back when it was just starting out.”

For example, I’m a Peloton user and I looked into doing one of their in-person classes. I also just read that Luckin Coffee (the Chinese chain) opened their second/third U.S. location in NYC, which feels like the kind of thing I’d like to check out before it blows up.

I’m really into food and sports/fitness, so anything along those lines that’s new, niche, or on the verge of becoming trendy would be amazing.

Quick context for first-time readers: I met this woman at my gym months ago, finally started talking to her, and recently she told me she’s getting divorced. She’s 35, married with a kid, but has been hinting at her marriage being over and that it’s just a “matter of time” before she files.

We worked out together the other day and then went to Starbucks. I asked her about her marriage directly and she said, *“What relationship? It’s not even good, just a matter of time before I file.”*

Here’s where it gets weird:

* She says she doesn’t need alimony or child support, even though she only works a part-time retail job. That doesn’t make sense to me.
* She first talked about moving to the city with her daughter, but then flipped and said maybe she’ll just stay nearby and use her husband’s address to keep her daughter in a good school district.
* She’s definitely flirty with me (texts with butterflies/flowers, working out together, saying yes to coffee), but when I think about it — none of this is actually solid proof she’s even serious about divorce.

Now I’m questioning if she’s actually leaving her husband at all, or just stringing me along for attention/ego boost. On top of that, I looked up her husband and he honestly looks like a scary dude — so even if she *is* serious, I’m not sure I want that kind of drama or risk.

So here I am: she’s married, possibly not even divorcing, maybe looking for a fling, maybe lying altogether. I know if I pushed things she’d probably be down, but that feels like crossing a huge line.

**Do I just stay friends with her? Or walk away completely?**

It was perfectly ordinary, but it was maybe the most special moment I’ve had as a dad thus far. 

My dad took me to breakfast every week before school when I was growing up. I’m incredibly close with my dad, and those breakfasts are a big reason why. He worked a ton, but he always made time to buy me pancakes and take me to school. 

Those breakfasts with my dad were a big reason I wanted to have kids in the first place. I’ve dreamed about this morning for longer than my daughter has been alive. 

And even though it was completely mundane, it was the start of what I can only hope will be a weekly tradition for the next 12 years of her life. I loved it.

Fired up my trusty (or so I thought) zomato app, placed an order, and waited with my gurgling stomach.

The bell rings, delivery guy rushes off before I can even say thank you. I carry the bag to my dining table, head to the kitchen for a plate, and notice brown drops on the floor. At first, I thought it was dirt… then realized — coffee. Okay, maybe just a few drops, no big deal.

But when I opened the bag? Absolute horror. Coffee everywhere — in my food, on my dining table, even on my iPad. Everything ruined.

So naturally, I turned to Zomato support. Surely, they’ll help me out, right? Wrong. I get stuck in a loop with an AI bot that keeps saying it doesn’t understand. No way to reach a human anymore. End result: no breakfast, wasted money, house smelling like coffee, and late for work after cleaning the mess.

And now I’m left wondering — as a paying customer, what exactly did I do wrong here?",2,1757040951.0,fuckkzomato,0,1.0,False

I'm not attention seeking either, just concerned, because this can't be healthy.

I (15F) am 5'5, 115lbs, and live a pretty active lifestyle. I play volleyball year-round pretty intensively (school season, travel season, and summer camps) in addition to the standard conditioning and working out. 

Generally, I don't feel hunger and don't eat. I don't ever eat breakfast, and I will occassionally have a coffee for lunch, but most of my calories come from a light dinner I eat--plain or minimal red sauce pasta; a bowl of almonds;  toasted baguette with butter; fruit, etc--sometimes not even ""proper food"", such as chips or hot chocolate.

The problem is my active lifestyle: for example, last summer, I played volleyball from 9-4 mon-fri and often would just eat something from the vending machine like wafers and not feel hunger for the rest of the day. Often times I would simply forget to eat until my body started feeling faint or light-headed, and I would force myself to eat something. 

Weird thing is, I'm not underweight either--I'm pretty sure I'm the perfect weight for my height and age according to the bmi scale. 

Anything I can do to improve my appetite? Am I just gonna be stuck either undereating or force feeding myself when I don't feel hungry?

I always persisted in my long distance relationship, her dad passes away and then she finally decided it wasn't working for her. Mind you she has been saying it for awhile now. I finally let her decide because she said I need some time to think whether this is for me or not

""Hiya, I need some time to think if I really want to do this again or not.
If you could just leave me be in the meanwhile I'd appreciate it, thanks.""

It was until my bday passed and she didn't reach out. It might seem like she moved on. I sent her that message and it was left on read and I think she muted me after.

I wanted to add an update because it's been about 2 and 1/2 months since I posted this and I didn't leave my job immediately after I quit. I was talked into staying and agreed to work until winter break. HP made some minor promises b(not money) to me which they of course broke and the unnecessary stress continued. I eventually called my boss in mid-August and said ""I'm not staying, I'm really leaving. My last day is August 31st."" I've only been out of my job for about 4 days now and as I was drinking coffee this morning, I realized that I made a very good decision for myself. It doesn't mean that I'm not afraid that my plan won't work, but it does mean that my gut is telling me ""yes."" If you're thinking about leaving, make a plan. Make sure it's a good plan, get prepared, and then leave. Don't tell anybody at work that you're thinking of leaving until you are ready. However, it is highly likely that your employer will try to talk you into staying. Now that I have really left, I've had friends and family tell me stories about staying in the corporate world even though they didn't want to. They were sucked back in and made deals with themselves to live their lives outside of work the best they could. I've also had people call me and tell me about working for HP describing unsolvable problems created by executives and dumped on employees. It confirms that I wasn't the only person feeling this. It's been very, very validating. The only unfortunate part of this is that I may wind up owing HP some money because they pay extra money before you've made sales to keep you financially afloat.  I've been working all summer long to set things up for sales in the fourth quarter, but I just couldn't wait to get out of there. The commissions I've earned won't go to whoever is working my accounts (HP won't let my manager hire someone into my role officially so he's doing extra work for no extra compensation). The commissions will probably go to executive bonuses instead, but the work was literally killing me. My back pain has gone away in less than a week. My skin tone is better. I'm trail running again after I was sure all my endurance was gone. I definitely feel better emotionally so I think that whatever I owe will be worth it in the long run. I will post another update when I have started school and will post an update after that when I'm generating income again. I want to encourage those who need it to do what's right for yourselves and your families with my story. Your life was not meant to be spent supporting the greed of soul-sick people.

1n8tsuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n8tsuz/are_women_being_too_idealistic/,Are women being too idealistic?,"I recently met an absolutely amazing woman, I don't think I've ever been attracted to anyone as much in my life both physically and personality wise. Met her at a singles event, got her number. We went on a coffee date, we got on great, conversation flowed well and there were no awkward silences or stuff like that.

After this she initially turned me down and said she didn't feel enough of a romantic connection, she is looking for something quite specific and maybe she is too brutal. What can you say to that? I pretty much just said I respect you know what you're looking for and I think you're incredible and you deserve the very best.

She seemed to be taken aback by this and surprised and we kept msging friendly and in a slightly flirty way. We then had 3 subsequent dates, a lunch, dinner at mine and dessert and chilling at her place. Honestly they all wet really great, we seemed to be on the same page, we got on great and the talking was really positive and we shared some kissing at mine and hers which also seemed good. Obviously I don't know everything but I'm confident of my ability to read a room and if someone is just not feeling it.

She told me on the subsequent dates how lovely it was and how kind I was...now she seemed like the world's most busiest woman (she was a lawyer) so I admit I did more of the chasing and maybe I did send too many msgs but I by no means love bombed her and went over the top. I was just naturally excited to be getting the opportunity to get to know this absolutely amazing person and was making my interest in her just clear. 

So after going to hers and surprising her with chocolate mousse I made and giving her flowers and then getting cosey and sharing some kissing I think this is really coming along nicely until 2 days later I get a msg from her while at work that she thinks I'm great and neither of us has done anything wrong but she just isn't quite feeling the romantic connection.

Obviously I was absolutely devestated and couldn't help but think is there something I did or said wrong but of course there really wasn't. I couldn't have been or treated her any better.

I openly admit that after this second rejection I let my emotions get the better of me and I sent her some msgs when I should've just left it. Nothing disrespectful or aggressive, just really searching for answers. I did own up and apologise to her for this for which she seemed to be quite understanding about.

We are not msging back and forth as we were for about 6 wks now, I only reached out to send her a brief happy birthday msg to which she said was very kind and I have left the ball in her court as to whether she ever wants to reach out to me but I can't see that happening.

I'm doing everything I should be doing, keeping busy, doing a crap load of exercise and continuing to push myself to go to as many singles events as I can and meet new people but in all honesty I do think about her a lot. I genuinely know that you can't make someone feel something for you but I really believe in not being dillusional when I say I think we had a connection and I think potentially we could've turned out to be an incredible match and obviously I'm incredibly disappointed on what could've been with this amazing person.

She deserves to be as happy as I would like to be and honestly I think she deserves the very best because she's incredible but I can't help thinking she may be a tad idealistic...I don't mean this in a negative or judgemental way but my gut tells me that she liked me but perhaps I didn't tick a couple of things off for her which I have driven myself crazy thinking about.

The only other thing I can think is that she wasn't used to someone being as nice as I was to her or that has somehow been perceived as me being too needy perhaps but all I was trying to do was be genuine with my intentions, communicate clearly and take a lead. I don't agree with acting withdrawn or playing games with people. 

I no it's probably wrong to think this but I hope one day we might cross paths again or she might reach out but I'm not an idiot and I know this is unlikely.

Does anyone have any advice at all for me?

1n8tsku,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1n8tsku/ideas_of_possible_mechanicschanges_in_blackfrost/,Ideas of possible mechanics/changes in Blackfrost,"As you all know, TLD2 is coming, and like many of you I’m very excited. While it’s still not out, I was thinking of possible ways BF might be different. It is a coop game, and while I think the devs don’t intend it being a PVP game, I still think there’s a lot of interesting gameplay ideas a Long Dark game with PVE can bring, along with different mechanics.

Sleep and Stamina:
The most obvious one would be sleep. I could imagine it would be very annoying to hop on a server with friends, play for like an hour, and then have to bunk down for 8 hours doing nothing while your character sleeps.

Therefore it may be in the interest of the gameplay if we removed sleep as the mechanic, and instead introduced a stamina system. Sprinting would decrease your stamina, and to replenish you need drink/eat to recover ~25% of the total, the rest is going to be recovered by eating/drinking special teas or something, aka coffee and actual tea. You stamina will recover to 100% if well fed and warm.

Beds/sleep mats would help to expedite it, imagine you and your friends holed up in a building or fire playing blackjack in game to rest up, eating and drinking to pass the time.

=====

Cooking:
Without the ability to pass time, perhaps cooking times will be decreased.

OR, perhaps it will be more involved, and you’d need a mini game where you need to stir the pot so it doesn’t burn (more calories this way) ie you’d need to actually put effort into cooking to make a higher quality/calorie end product.

Imagine you’re the camp cook, you have a job of cooking for your friends while they gather firewood or go do other things essential for the camp, like getting water, working on another dish, hunting, crafting.

=====

Time:
A coop game means the passage of time will become hard to make sense in a game like BF. Perhaps a mechanic wherein your friends will all need to hit confirm to pass time together? So one guy wants to sleep 8 in game hours, the others will need to also agree to that so time will pass.

Alternatively, you just wait out the cooking/crafting time IRL.

=====

Inventory/Weight Management:
With the addition of friends, it’d be OP if everyone can carry 60lbs of gear/loot. Perhaps in coop everyone needs a backpack to actually store thing. You would need to distribute the load between you and your friends. 

Instead of item capacity being governed by weight alone, perhaps a volume system is implemented. So for instance you have a backpack capable of storing 50 sq inches of stuff, but a can of soup is like 10 sq inches, so you’d only be able to take 5 cans, but with a friend he can take another 5 cans with him.

Clothing would have its own storage, like each pocket has around 8 sq inches of volume, so a backpack or satchel is required for holding things.

Firearms and tools need to be secured with holsters, slings, otherwise they need to be dropped etc. You can fit a hatchet in your pack, hold it in your hands, but a large two man saw either needs to be transported via a sling or fit into a special tool slot on your pack.

Rifles/shotguns for instance, require a sling to be slung, a handgun or revolver needs a holster to be equipped using your hotkeys.

Special backpacks would be needed for things like water or wood collections because they’re bulky items for making a camp.

=====

The wildlife:
To make things harder in a coop game, maybe introduce realistic hunting mechanics.

Animals can see/hear more realistically, so you’d need to implement real life hunting techniques such as camouflage and scent concealment.

Animals can be more skittish if they smell you from upwind, so care needs to be taken to approach your prey from downwind.

You party can set up ambushes on game trails, where someone flushed the animal down towards a friends with a bow or gun.

You can’t hit rabbits with a rock as easily, it’s just not accurate enough. You’d need to set up snares in an area where there’s a lot of hood prints or droppings. 

A shotgun would be useful for hitting birds like ptarmigans/crows, but care needs to be taken, you can use buckshot, but your ptarmigan would be inedible. 

Wildlife aggression will be amped up, a stag might charge you if not careful. Wolves might stalk you for miles, potentially attacking your camp if in the open. Someone would need to be on the lookout for timberwolves at night.

=====

Other players/role play:
In a PVE server, other players can serve as a potential for making friends or trading. Imagine running into another group, and trading a few cans of beans for a hacksaw.

Maybe with a coop server, tools and the like are scarcer than in single player, so someone might have a bow repair tool, gunsmith kits, reloading kits, forging materials like lead, steel, heavy hammers.

You may need to post up on bulletin boards flyers advertising your services for other players, like a farrier service for horses and the like.

We may even get an in game economy of trading for meat/fish from fishers, hunters, repairers. 

Someone might be a good cook, and will trade for ammo, someone who makes ammo can trade for vitamin C rich foods. Maybe someone with a bunch of cans and a drying rack can make meat jerky for trade, maybe for a new axe or arrows. Gunsmiths will repair weapons

In a PVP server, there may be raiders, you’ll have to defend your camp, but I’m less focused on PVP.

=====

Communication:
There will be no in game chat. Everything will be done by flyers, letters, and proximity voice chat.

If you die, you better have formed a plan to meet up at an area, because your friends will have a harder time finding you otherwise.

Perhaps people will start playing as a courier, delivering goods and letters, fighting the elements, bots (AI raiders/bandits), and the wildlife to connect people on one side of the map to the other side.

Few after, december 2 days before my birthday that wanted to be in mexico I was ran over by a car while coming home from highschool, nothing broken but a big contusion in my knee, being a athlete it was bad and I couldn’t walk properly but even so, I tried to go back, I was done with this but had to stay for doing police report and everything past, I went mexico for christmas but not the same like that, I told my dad that I wanted to stay and I paid everything, school, exams, uniform and the round trip to get my thing to LA but said no.
 
Few months passed and I was pretty tired of emocional abuse, blackmail from mom saying if I go she’d call police, remove my greencard and my now sue for the insurance, this keeps repeating everytime I wanted to talk to her about it, then in march I tried suicide but failed, I got into a psiquiatric hospital for 7 days, while in there I was sad, hopeless, 1 day she visit and she were telling me thing about of idiot I am so decided to go back inside in 15 minutes, even though visits were allowed for more than an hour, my heart sank in hopeless but then my dad told me that I will come back, so I lied to get discharged faster, but nothing, I did not went back and the same keep happening.

After finishing my 9th grade I went mexico with the intentions of staying because as my dad said, “stay there a year, then we’ll see”, nothing whole summer there, gym, volley ball and getting money to buy a car in mexico, I did everything and even found a job and a coffee from a family friend that was trainer and manager from few important restaurants, was my opportunity to get job experience, everything was going fine besides my mom, I had the money for a private school, money to pay my mom some money I borrowed and money to get a car. When things were going well she called when I was working, 4 times, 3 of them to insult me and the fourth to get me to come back to LA to accompany my sister because was her first time in US and highschool. 

I was thinking it because last time, they told me it was a 2 weeks try and lied, this time same thing “just 2 weeks, we go to vegas and you go”. I didn’t wanted to but my dad said “go” because he thing US is the best thing ever, american dream and all that, so I came, got into school, planned my round way trip and everything, after vegas I said “I’m going now, I did what I had” everytime being respectful, but same thing. They told me to stay, I was better here, just try this year, now I’m in 10 grade 
rotating 4 outfits, I don’t even know what to do anymore.

I know my dad can have me there but my mom manipulates him so bad, I’m just in automatic, having thoughts, this is my first time writting in reddit and I don’t know if its too much or need more details that I have.",1,1757040237.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1n8trme,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1n8trme/after_almost_a_year_of_silence_i_finally_feel/,"After almost a year of silence, I finally feel brave enough to share my story. For confidentiality, I’ll just call them a “global music tech conglomerate.” This company tried to destroy my reputation, my health, and my music career just before I had the chance to bloom as an electronic artist.","*Pay + Exploitation*

I worked in the testing department across all their IPs, hopping from brand to brand at short notice. I’d even moved countries for the position.

The salary was meagre. I signed the contract anyway because, like a lot of young professionals, I wanted to “make it” in the industry. But the highly specialised skillset they demanded was worth far more than what we earned.

Most new staff literally starved the week before payday. One October, I had to live on “survivalist food” just to get by. When the living wage increased, they were forced to give everyone fake “promotions” just to stay legal.


*Sexism + Double Standards*

There were only four women in the entire office. My female superiors were pushed into admin tasks that men didn’t have to do, and they often faced lewd comments behind closed doors.

One colleague made a sexual remark about me. Everyone laughed at my expense. Totally normal in male-dominated tech spaces. Unsurprising.

Rules were also different for me. The men would take hour-long paid coffee breaks at 3pm with no issues. If I split my 30-min lunch into two 15-min breaks? I got penalised.


*Medical Discrimination*

I have a health condition and take medication. I was upfront about this from day one.

Still, I was treated differently. When everyone else earned the right to WFH, I was denied. They said they didn’t “trust” me because I was on medication. I should have left then, but I stayed because I loved the field.

Later, HR demanded I disclose every detail of my condition, including exact names of meds - or risk being fired. Pretty sure that’s illegal. I even paid for a doctor’s note.


*Music + Jealousy*

Outside of work, I wrote, produced, and performed electronic music. Lots of us had side gigs, and it was allowed contractually.

My music started to gain traction. My flatmates once heard me mixing and called me “the next Radiohead.” I was happy about my fresh, unique sound.

Then word spread at work. The new head of department, a man in his 40s, seemed weirdly threatened by me. I think he resented that I was a woman making my own music while also excelling technically. Insecure men often lash out when women “upstage” them.


*Retaliation + Firing*

That same week, he bad-mouthed me to my manager behind my back.

I got disciplined for learning a language *during my lunch break*. Then, the day after my first (unpaid) live gig, I was let go on the spot. No severance. No notice. They even mentioned my live gig *before* firing me.

My manager even wrote in the company chat about my strangely sudden departure from the company.

“DO NOT RESPOND. DO NOT REACT.”

Instant isolation. My friends and colleagues were terrified to talk to me for fear of losing their jobs.


*Collapse*

The stress wrecked my health. I unintentionally started starving. I was so traumatised and embarrassed I avoided public places in case I bumped into ex-colleagues. I was terrified of retaliation from the man who slandered me.

Somehow, I still landed a much higher paying role while literally going weeks without food. My sodium levels dropped so low I ended up in the ER. But sadly the hospital staff also neglected me too.

Eventually, I lost all hope. I sadly attempted to end my life. The pain was too much. My father found me just in time. I was 29.


*Aftermath*

It’s been a year of fighting my way back. I’ve lost critical opportunities, future earnings, and confidence. I spent 14+ years of my life dedicated to music, only to be cut down violently just at the very moment before I could bloom.


*Why Am I Sharing This?*

I don’t want pity. I just want people to know how exploitative, sexist, and discriminatory certain companies within the industry can be and how quickly they can destroy you out of spite or jealousy. Especially if you don't fit the mold. Watch yourself out there.

If you’re going through something similar please, protect your health first. No job no ""dream"" is worth losing that. Professional sabotage is much more common than we want to think.",26,1757040207.0,WorkReform,5,0.89,False

\#RhRR is a grassroots, bottom-up, and local effort to show our neighbors and passersby they are not the only ones furious, embarrassed, worried, and/or fed up with the Republican regime. While we support and attend large-scale, centralized protests and rallies, we need near-constant reminders of the crisis we're all in. 

And that's what we do at five locations around the valley three mornings a week! Click the link to get specific locations, parking info, and more.

On Tuesday mornings, you can join us at:

* [Cole Park in Tempe @ 6:30 am](https://rhrr.us/#page-3) 
* [Social Security Admin building in downtown Phoenix @ 7:00 am](https://rhrr.us/#page-4)

And on Thursday morning, we're outside the [ICE field office at Central & Monte Vista @ 7:00 am](https://rhrr.us/#page-2) 

When it gets cooler, we'll start having more events for the evening rush hour. Locations to be determined, but we'll worry about that when it's not blazing hot.

Hit me up with questions (evo@rhrr.us) or in the comments. And come join us if you can! And if you can't, spread the word, will ya?

1n8tpc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1n8tpc2/she_put_up_photos_of_everyone_but_me_the_mom/,She put up photos of everyone but me (the mom),"I’ve been having issues with my MIL for a while now but I wasn’t sure if I was being too sensitive up until this point. I’ll start by saying that I always thought we had an okay relationship. She is a bit of a control freak, but we got along well enough, and I liked her. Before I had my son, we never had any issues, but it’s like as soon as he was born, a switch flipped and she went insane or something. A few examples: 

 - She asked if she could be in the delivery room, but I politely told her I’d prefer it was just my husband and I. Fast forward to the day of delivery (I ended up having a scheduled c-section), and who shows up within minutes of us to the hospital room but MIL… in her defense, maybe she thought since things had changed, it would be okay. But she was there when we got back from surgery so we never got that moment together alone with our baby. At the time I wrote it off as her just being excited, but now I feel like it was a huge crossing of boundaries. 

 - She loves to take him without asking whenever she feels like it. If we’re visiting and one of us is holding him, she feels entitled to just come and take him from our arms. Or there have been times where we finally get to her house, (which is a two and a half hour drive so we need to change him) she will hover in the doorway of the room and as soon as he’s changed, she swoops in and takes him away, again without asking. One time we were all together with family, a relative was holding him, and my husband said okay I’ll take him now and she said “okay let me help”, but instead of passing him over, she just keeps him on her lap. 

 - Once she finally gets her clutches on him, she loves to take him to another room, or go outside so she is alone with him. I don’t know why she has to be alone with him.

 - She is a huge baby hog and loves to hold him for long periods of time. I remember during the first week of my son’s life, she asked to hold him and she went into another room and was reading while he slept on her lap. That alone doesn’t bother me, but she kept him there for about two hours, and I was getting so anxious because it made me really uncomfortable. But then there are other times where she’ll seem like she really wants to hold him, and then passes him off to someone else (Almost weirdly feels like she takes him just to play mom and be the one who gets to offer him to people). 

 - If I try and gently assert myself and say I’m going to take him and get him to sleep, she’ll say “oh he doesn’t seem tired”. Or I say that it’s time to feed him and she says “when is the last time he ate?” Seems weird especially considering I’m his mom and I spend all day with him so I know his schedule. 

 - She buys him all kinds of things, which alone isn’t mean, but she’s bought some of his first holiday outfits, which is upsetting because that to me seems like a privilege the parent should have. One time she came over and I showed her the Fourth of July shirt I got for him, and a few days later she texts us a picture of a different Fourth of July outfit that she bought. 

 I could sit and ramble all day about the things she does that upset me, but the thing that really topped it all off happened this weekend. We went over to visit because other family was going to be there as well. If you know her, you’d know that pictures are her thing. Her hallway walls are covered with family photos, her decorative tables, coffee table, mantle, dining room walls, and even bedroom walls have photos all over them. Well this weekend I noticed that she had put out 20 new photos of my son, which I thought was a little excessive considering he’s only 5 months old, but I appreciated the enthusiasm. However, I noticed something odd. She put up photos with my husband holding our son, with her, and even her mom holding him as well, but not one of me. Not one single picture including me, his own mother. That really hurt my feelings. I ended up calling her out on it. I made sure to be nice about it, but I told her how it made me feel. My husband feels the same way I do about her and the situation, and I know generally since it’s his mom, the husband should be the one to call her out, but there was a rage in me from all of this building up, and also I knew it was possible she’d be more dismissive of him, so I did it. I wanted to because she wouldn’t be able to brush me off. She claimed that it was because she didn’t have any photos of us together she thought I would want up. We have been together for 13 years so she has photos. I know she had photos that she took in the hospital of us, and she could have just as easily asked us to send her some if she felt I should be included in her shrine to my son. Anyways, after she said that, I also called her out for boundary crossing and told her I don’t appreciate her undermining me and picking him up without asking, but all she said was that she understood. A very short worded response compared to the one she sent after I called her out about the photos. 

I guess after everything, I’m happy I called her out and the only way we’ll know if she takes me seriously is on the next visit, but I just had to get that off my chest. I just don’t understand her, I’ve literally not had this problem with anyone else! ",16,1757040021.0,JUSTNOMIL,9,0.91,False

My girlfriend '18F' and I had been together for almost a year, officially in a relationship for six months. We started dating when she was 18 and I was 23.
From the beginning, I was open with her about the possibility of going long distance after I graduated. She always said she was okay with it, and we tried to build something real despite knowing that deadline was coming.
But we had our share of issues. We’d fight about things like her drinking, wearing revealing clothes, and even her grabbing coffee one-on-one with her gay guy friends. I fully admit I felt insecure, not proud of it, and I let those insecurities show in unhealthy ways.
She eventually broke up with me, saying I was immature and needed to work on myself. I called her right away, apologized, and we got back together. But two days later, she ended things again for the same reasons. I kept trying. I sent heartfelt messages. She took me back again.
We started talking seriously about long-distance. She wanted to know a clear timeline, when I’d come back to the U.S. I told her I didn’t have a definite plan yet. She didn’t want to move to Dubai or even meet halfway. She expected me to do all the compromising.
Eventually, she broke up with me again, this time for good. She told me never to contact her again and that if I did, she’d block me. I panicked. I texted her right after to tell her I’d stay for her, I’d delay going back to Dubai, but she blocked me. In that moment of panic and heartbreak, I called her older sister '30F' , who I’d spoken to before. I broke down crying while explaining everything to her.
A few days later, I texted my ex again asking her to reconsider, but she didn’t reply.
Now I’m five days from leaving the country, and it’s tearing me apart that I won’t get to say goodbye. I understand she set a boundary, but I’m struggling with the fact that a person I loved this deeply could cut me off completely. I don’t want to push her further away, but I feel like I’m leaving with this huge emotional knot in my chest.

1n8tfpi,https://youtu.be/3MSWxUUVWDw,4 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Supply Run Horror Stories,"# ""Mail Day Massacre"":

I woke up that morning knowing mail day was coming. Living out here in this remote spot in Alaska, cut off from everything, the weekly plane drop was our lifeline for food, parts, and letters. My cabin sat a few miles from the main cluster of houses in McCarthy, and I figured I'd head over early to help unload. My neighbor Louis had stopped by the night before for a game of cards, but he left late. I didn't think much of it.

I finished my coffee and stepped outside to start my snowmobile. The engine roared to life, and I rode toward town. As I got closer, something felt wrong. No smoke rose from the chimneys like usual. Normally, folks would be stirring, getting ready for the plane. But everything looked still. I slowed down near the first house, the Heglands'. Their door hung open a bit. I called out, ""Les? Flo? You up?""

No answer. I pushed the door wider and walked in. The place smelled of fresh coffee, but then I saw the blood. It splattered the floor and walls. Les lay face down near the table, a hole in his back. Flo slumped in the corner, her eyes open but empty. My hands shook as I backed out. What had happened? A fight? An accident? I ran to the next house, Maxine's. Her door was shut, but when I knocked, it creaked open. Inside, she was on the floor, shot too. Blood pooled around her head.

Panic rose in me. I grabbed my rifle from the snowmobile and moved to the Nashes' place. Tim and Amy were good people, young couple. Their door was ajar. I peeked in and saw them both down, bodies twisted, blood everywhere. Nearby, Harley King's cabin showed the same horror—him crumpled by his stove, shot multiple times.

Who did this? My mind raced. I thought of Louis. He lived close to me, but he hadn't shown up for mail day. Was he okay? Or was he part of this? I hopped back on the snowmobile and sped to his place. His door was closed. I banged on it. ""Louis! It's Chris! Open up!""

The door swung open, and there he stood, holding a gun. His eyes looked wild, not like the quiet guy I knew. ""Chris,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Come in.""

I stepped inside, rifle in hand, but he moved fast, pointing his pistol at me. ""Drop it,"" he ordered.

""What's going on, Louis? I saw the bodies. Did you... why?""

He smiled a little, like it was nothing. ""They had to go. All of them. The pipeline, the outsiders—they're coming to ruin everything. I had to clear the way.""

""What are you talking about? These are our neighbors!""

He shook his head. ""No time for talk. You're next.""

I lunged at him, but he fired. The bullet grazed my arm, burning hot. I dropped my rifle and grabbed for a knife on his table. He came at me, grabbing my throat. ""Look, you're already dead,"" he whispered close to my face. ""If you'll just quit fighting, I'll make it easy for you.""

His words hit like ice. I slashed the knife across his face, drawing blood. He yelled and loosened his grip. I shoved him back and ran out the door, feet sinking into the snow. I had no boots on, just socks, but I didn't care. The cold bit hard, but fear pushed me. I heard him behind me, cursing, firing shots that whizzed past.

I stumbled through the trees, heart racing, breath coming in gasps. My feet went numb fast, but I kept going. ""Help!"" I shouted, but who would hear? The town was dead. Then I heard an engine—a snowmobile. It was Donna, one of the few left. She saw me waving and pulled up.

""Chris! What happened? You're bleeding!""

""Louis... he killed everyone. Get me to the airstrip. The plane's coming.""

She nodded, face pale, and I climbed on. We raced to the strip just as the mail plane touched down. The pilot, Jim, stepped out, looking confused. ""Where is everybody?""

""Louis went crazy,"" I gasped. ""Shot up the town. Killed six, maybe more.""

Jim's eyes widened. ""Get in. We'll fly to Glennallen, tell the troopers.""

As we lifted off, I looked down. Smoke rose from one cabin—Louis must have set a fire. Donna sat quiet, shaking. ""He almost got me too,"" I said.

Jim radioed ahead. ""Emergency. Mass shooting in McCarthy. Suspect armed.""

Hours later, troopers flew in. They found Louis twenty miles out, on his snowmobile, trying to escape. He didn't fight when they cuffed him. Charged with six counts of murder. Turns out he was paranoid about some pipeline plot, thought killing us all would stop it.

I got my arm fixed, feet thawed. But sleep doesn't come easy now. Every creak in the cabin makes me jump. Living off-grid was supposed to be peaceful. Now it's a nightmare I can't escape.





# ""Raised in Silence"":

I grew up in a world far from roads and people, where my family built our home deep in the Alaskan wilderness. My father led us there, promising a pure life away from the corrupt outside. We were fifteen kids, all taught to obey without question. Our cabin sat miles from the nearest town, McCarthy, a tiny spot with just a handful of folks who eyed us strangely when we showed up. Supplies didn't last forever, though. Every few months, Father would pick one of us to go with him on the long ride to town for flour, tools, and whatever else we needed to survive another stretch of isolation.

This time, he chose me. I was the oldest daughter, nineteen then, and I knew the routine. We saddled the horses early one morning, the trail ahead twisting through thick trees and over rocky streams. Father rode in front, his rifle slung across his back, humming old hymns under his breath. I followed on my mare, the packs empty for now, my hands tight on the reins. He didn't talk much at first, but I felt his eyes on me whenever he glanced back.

""You remember what I taught you, girl?"" he said after a while, his voice low and steady, like he was testing me.

""Yes, Father,"" I replied, keeping my tone even. ""The world out there is full of evil. We stick to our path.""

He nodded, satisfied for the moment. ""Good. Because if you stray, the Lord sees it. And so do I.""

The words hung between us as we pushed on. The ride took hours, the forest closing in tight. I thought about the bruises hidden under my sleeves, the nights when he'd come into the room I shared with my sisters, whispering that it was God's will. My brothers and sisters back at the cabin didn't know the full extent, or if they suspected, they stayed silent. Fear kept us all in line. But lately, doubts had crept in, small at first, like cracks in ice.

By midday, we reached the edge of McCarthy. It wasn't much—a dirt road, a few old buildings, a store where outsiders traded goods. Father tied the horses outside the general store and went in first, leaving me to wait. ""Stay put,"" he ordered. ""Don't talk to anyone.""

I stood there, watching people go by. A man in a truck nodded at me, but I looked away quick. Inside, I heard Father bartering with the store owner, his voice rising in that charming way he had when he wanted something. Minutes dragged on. My mind raced. What if I walked away right now? The thought made my pulse quicken. But where? He always watched so close.

He came out with sacks of grain and nails, loading them onto the horses. ""Help me,"" he said, and I did, our hands brushing as we tied the knots. His grip lingered on my arm a second too long, a reminder. We mounted up again, but he decided we needed fuel for the generator too. ""One more stop,"" he muttered, leading us to the fuel depot down the road.

At the depot, an older couple ran the place. The woman, Mrs. Thompson, smiled at me as Father haggled over prices. ""You look tired, dear,"" she said softly while he was busy with her husband. ""Everything all right at home?""

I froze, my mouth dry. Father was just feet away, but his back was turned. ""I'm fine,"" I whispered, but my voice shook.

She frowned, glancing at him. ""If you need anything, you can tell me.""

Father turned then, his eyes narrowing. ""What are you two chatting about?""

""Nothing, sir,"" Mrs. Thompson said quickly. ""Just asking about the trail conditions.""

He stared at her, then at me. ""Let's go, girl. We don't need idle talk.""

We rode out of town, the supplies heavy on the horses. The forest swallowed us again, but something had shifted. Father's mood darkened. He didn't hum anymore. Instead, he started questioning me. ""What did that woman really say to you?""

""Just about the trail, Father,"" I lied, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped his horse abruptly, forcing me to halt. ""Don't lie to me. I can see it in your eyes. You're thinking of betraying us, aren't you?""

My breath caught. How did he know? He always seemed to know. ""No, Father. I would never.""

He leaned closer, his face inches from mine. ""Remember what happened last time one of you thought about running? Your brother still bears the scars. The Lord punishes the wicked, and I am His instrument.""

I nodded, terror twisting inside me. We continued, but the trail felt endless now. Every rustle in the bushes made me jump, imagining him turning on me right there. Hours passed, and as the light faded, we neared a stream where we sometimes camped if the ride ran long. Father decided we'd stop for the night. ""Too risky in the dark,"" he said.

We set up a small fire, ate cold biscuits from the supplies. He watched me the whole time, not blinking much. ""Tell me the truth now,"" he said after we ate. ""What did she say?""

""Nothing, I swear."" My hands trembled as I fed the horses.

He stood up slowly, his shadow stretching across the ground. ""You're hiding something. Come here.""

I backed away a step. ""Please, Father. I didn't do anything.""

His hand shot out, grabbing my wrist hard. ""You think you can fool me? After all I've done for this family?""

Pain shot up my arm, but worse was the look in his eyes—cold, unyielding. I yanked free, stumbling back. ""Stop! You're hurting me!""

He advanced, voice rising. ""You ungrateful child. I'll teach you obedience.""

In that moment, panic took over. I turned and ran, crashing through the underbrush, branches whipping my face. Behind me, I heard him shout my name, his boots pounding the ground. The forest was a maze, dark shapes everywhere. I tripped over roots, fell hard, but got up, lungs burning. His voice echoed, closer now. ""Come back! You can't survive out here alone!""

I kept going, heart slamming in my chest. Minutes felt like forever. I burst out onto a faint trail, one I remembered led back toward McCarthy. But he was gaining—I could hear his horse now, he'd mounted up. Hooves thundered behind me.

Up ahead, lights flickered. A cabin? No, a ranger station, one of those outposts near the park boundary. I pounded on the door, screaming. ""Help! Please, open up!""

A man inside yanked it open, rifle in hand. ""What's going on?""

""My father—he's coming! He's dangerous!""

The ranger pulled me inside, bolting the door. Through the window, I saw Father approach on horseback, his face twisted in rage. ""Give her back! She's my daughter!""

The ranger radioed for help, keeping his gun ready. ""Stay away, sir. Authorities are on the way.""

Father circled the station, yelling threats. ""You'll regret this! The Lord will judge you all!""

I huddled in the corner, telling the ranger everything—the beatings, the worse things he did in the night, how he controlled us all. Words poured out, things I'd never said aloud. The ranger listened, his face hardening.

Help arrived after what seemed like ages—state troopers on ATVs, lights flashing. They confronted Father, but he didn't fight. Not then. He glared at me through the window as they cuffed him. ""This isn't over,"" he mouthed.

They took him away, and me to safety. Later, my brothers and sisters were rescued from the cabin. The truth came out in court—his past crimes, the abuse spanning years. He went to prison, died there alone.

But even now, years later, when I'm far from that place, I wake up sometimes, thinking I hear his voice in the wind. The wilderness hides secrets, and some scars never fully heal.





# ""The Roadblock"":

I decided to head into town earlier than usual that morning. My cabin sits deep in the Montana backcountry, miles from any paved road, and I only make the trip once a month for groceries, fuel, and whatever else keeps me going through the isolation. The drive takes two hours each way on dirt tracks that wind through thick pines and empty valleys. No cell service for most of it, just me and the truck. I loaded up on canned goods, batteries, and a new propane tank at the general store, chatted a bit with the clerk about the early frost coming in, and started back before noon. The road felt quieter than normal, with no other vehicles in sight.

About halfway home, I rounded a bend and saw a fallen tree across the path. It was a big one, fresh enough that the bark still looked damp where it had snapped. I stopped the truck, engine idling, and stepped out to check if I could drag it aside with the winch on my bumper. That's when I noticed the tire tracks veering off into the brush nearby, like someone had pulled over recently. I figured maybe a logger or hunter had an accident, so I called out, ""Hello? Anyone need a hand?"" No answer at first, just the wind rustling the leaves.

Then, from behind a cluster of trees, a man stepped out. He was tall, maybe six-foot-four, with matted hair and clothes that looked like he'd been wearing them for weeks—faded jeans caked in mud, a flannel shirt torn at the sleeves. His eyes were sharp, fixed on me right away. ""You got a chainsaw in that truck?"" he asked, his voice rough but steady, like he was used to giving orders.

I nodded slowly, keeping my distance. ""Yeah, back in the bed. You the one who put this tree here?""

He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Nah, storm did that last night. But good timing you showing up. I could use some help clearing it. My rig's stuck back there."" He pointed vaguely into the woods, where I could just make out the outline of an old camper trailer half-hidden in the shadows. It looked rundown, with tarps draped over parts of it, like someone was living rough out here.

I felt uneasy, but out here, folks help each other. I grabbed the chainsaw from the truck and walked over, starting it up with a pull. As I cut into the trunk, he stood too close, watching every move. ""You live around here?"" he said over the noise.

""Up the road a ways,"" I replied, focusing on the blade. ""Off-grid place. Just grabbing supplies today.""

He nodded, stepping even closer. ""Off-grid, huh? Smart man. Away from all the noise. We got a setup like that too. Me and a couple friends. You should come see it. We're always looking for extra hands with chores.""

The way he said ""we"" made me pause. I glanced back at the trailer and saw movement—a curtain twitch, then a face peering out for a split second before vanishing. ""No thanks,"" I said, shutting off the saw. ""I need to get home before dark. This should be clear enough now.""

But as I turned to head back, he grabbed my arm, not hard at first, but firm. ""Hold on. You can't just leave. We need that chainsaw. And maybe some of those supplies you picked up. Share and share alike, right?""

I pulled away, my grip tightening on the tool. ""Let go. I'm not giving you anything.""

His face hardened, and he reached into his pocket, pulling out a hunting knife with a long blade that glinted in the light. ""Don't make this difficult. Hand over the keys too. We'll take the truck off your hands. No one around to hear you yell.""

My mind raced. The road was blocked behind me, but I could reverse if I moved fast. I swung the chainsaw handle at his wrist, connecting just enough to make him drop the knife and curse in pain. He lunged, but I dodged and ran for the truck, jumping in and slamming the door. The engine roared as I threw it in reverse, tires spinning on the dirt. Through the windshield, I saw him pick up the knife and start after me, shouting, ""You won't get far! We know these woods!""

I backed up fast, weaving around ruts, until I hit a narrow side trail I'd used once for hunting. It was rough, branches scraping the sides, but it looped around the blockage. In the rearview, I spotted him running back toward the trailer, and then another figure emerged—shorter, with a rifle slung over his shoulder. They—no, he and that other man—started toward a beat-up jeep parked nearby, its engine firing up with a growl.

The chase lasted maybe ten minutes, but it felt endless. My truck bounced over roots and rocks, the side trail barely wide enough. Their jeep was gaining, headlights flashing in my mirrors as they honked wildly. ""Pull over!"" I heard one yell faintly through the open windows. ""We just want to talk!""

I pushed the pedal harder, sweat dripping down my face, until the trail spit me out onto the main road beyond the fallen tree. I floored it toward home, glancing back every few seconds. The jeep followed for a mile or so, then suddenly veered off into the trees, disappearing. Maybe they didn't want to risk getting closer to where rangers patrol.

I made it to my cabin, locked every door and window, and spent the night with my shotgun across my lap, listening for any sound outside. In the morning, I drove back to town and reported it to the sheriff. He said they'd had reports of squatters in that area—guys running from warrants, setting up camps in the backwoods, preying on anyone who passed by. They sent a deputy to check, but the trailer was gone, just tire marks and a cold fire pit left behind.

That was six months ago. I still make my supply runs, but now I take a longer route, and I always carry extra fuel in case I need to turn around quick. Sometimes, when the wind picks up at night, I wonder if those men are still out there, waiting for the next lone driver to come along. Living off-grid means freedom, but it also means you're on your own when trouble finds you.





# ""Trust Me, He Said"":

I had been staying in my little cabin up in the mountains for close to a year. The place was basic, no power lines or neighbors for miles, just me and the trees. I liked it that way, away from all the noise. But supplies don't last forever. Food, fuel for the generator, some tools—I made the drive down to the small town every few weeks. The road was narrow, full of twists, and if something went wrong, help was hard to find.

That morning, I loaded up my empty cans and bags into the old truck and started the engine. It coughed a bit, like always, but soon hummed along. The drive took about two hours each way, and I planned to grab what I needed and get back before dark. I passed the usual spots: the old bridge, the pull-off where hunters sometimes parked. Everything felt normal until about an hour in, when the truck shuddered. Smoke came from under the hood, and the whole thing died right there on a straight stretch.

I got out and popped the hood. Steam everywhere, and I could smell something burning. No idea what broke—I’m no mechanic. My phone had no signal, as expected in these parts. I waited, hoping another vehicle would come by. Minutes turned into half an hour. Finally, I heard an engine approaching from behind. A beat-up sedan pulled up, and the driver rolled down his window. He was a middle-aged guy, balding, with a friendly smile at first.

""You okay?"" he asked, leaning out.

""Yeah, truck just quit on me. Think it's the radiator or something.""

He nodded. ""Happens out here. Want me to take a look?""

I stepped back as he got out. He poked around under the hood for a minute, then shook his head. ""Looks bad. You need a tow, probably. Town's not far—I can give you a lift if you want. Name's Tom.""

I hesitated, but what choice did I have? Walking would take hours, and no one else was coming. ""Appreciate it. I'm Alex.""

We got in his car, and he started driving toward town. At first, it was fine. He asked about my cabin, how long I'd been living off-grid. I kept answers short—didn't want to share too much. But then he started talking about his own life, how he used to work in the city but moved out here for ""peace."" His voice had this edge, like he was forcing the words.

After a bit, he took a turn off the main road. ""Shortcut,"" he said when I looked over. ""Saves time.""

The new road was even narrower, gravel crunching under the tires. Trees closed in tight. ""You sure this leads to town?"" I asked.

""Oh yeah,"" he replied, grinning. ""Trust me. Hey, you got family out here?""

""No, just me.""

He nodded slowly. ""Good. Being alone is best sometimes.""

That made my skin prickle. We drove in silence for a while, but the road didn't seem right. No signs, no familiar landmarks. I checked my phone again—no bars. ""Maybe we should turn back,"" I suggested.

""Nah, we're almost there."" But he slowed down and pulled over at a clearing with an old, rundown shed. ""Car's acting up. Overheating, I think. Mind grabbing the water jug from the trunk? It's right in there.""

I paused. Something felt off. Why stop now? ""You got a jug?""

""Yeah, blue one. Pop the trunk.""

I got out, heart beating faster. The trunk latch clicked open. I lifted it, and inside, mixed with tools and rags, I saw ropes. Thick ones, coiled neat. And a roll of duct tape. My mouth went dry. Why would he need that?

From the car, he called, ""Find it?""

""Uh, yeah."" I grabbed the jug, but my mind raced. No way was I getting back in. The shed was close—maybe I could run.

He stepped out then, walking toward me. ""Let me help."" His eyes looked different now, sharper.

I backed up. ""Actually, I think I'll walk from here. Thanks for the ride.""

His smile faded. ""Come on, Alex. Don't be like that. We're friends now.""

""No, really. I got it.""

He took another step. ""You sure? It's dangerous out here alone.""

That's when I bolted. Dropped the jug and ran into the trees, branches whipping my face. Behind me, I heard him shout, ""Hey! Get back here!""

I didn't stop. Crashed through underbrush, heart pounding in my ears. He followed at first—I could hear footsteps crunching leaves—but I was faster, knew how to move in the woods from all my time out here. I zigzagged, found a stream, waded through to hide my trail. After what felt like forever, the sounds stopped. I hid behind a fallen log, breathing quiet, listening.

Nothing. No more footsteps. I waited there, shaking, until the light started fading. Then I crept out, found my way back to the main road. It took hours, feet sore, but I flagged down a passing logger's truck. The driver, an older guy named Bill, gave me a ride to town. ""You look rough,"" he said. ""What happened?""

I told him about the breakdown, the ride, the weird stop. His face went serious. ""Bald guy? Sedan?""

""Yeah. Why?""

Bill shook his head. ""Sounds like that fella who's been around. Cops been looking for him. Folks say he picks up hitchers, but some don't make it back.""

My blood ran cold. In town, I went straight to the sheriff's office. Gave them the details—Tom, the car, the ropes. They took notes, said they'd check it out. My truck got towed in later, fixed for a busted hose.

Days passed, and I stayed in my cabin, doors locked tight, even though I never did before. Then, a week later, the sheriff called. ""We found him,"" he said. ""Arrested on an old warrant. Assault, kidnapping attempt from years back. You got lucky.""

I hung up, staring out the window at the dark trees. Every time I make that supply run now, I check the engine twice. And I never accept rides. The mountains are peaceful, but people—they can turn everything wrong in a blink.",1,1757039250.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1n8tfbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1n8tfbn/quick_access_guides_for_interrupting_pain_and/,Quick access guides for interrupting pain and negative thought spirals.,"In working with ChatGPT on PTSD counseling, we've put together 4 quick access cards that I use to break cycles. I thought I would share them in hopes that someone else finds them helpful. I keep a screenshot of each on my phone so I can find them quickly. Now, these are written for me and my abilities. If you use one or more of these guides, do alter them as appropriate for you. For example, I can stand up and stretch, Zonco and Foxy are our pet dogs, I like to do Jigsaw puzzles on my Tablet, the phrase ""You’re not mine to carry any more.” is one tool that I use to help stop thought loops.

=======================================================

# 🟦 Behavioral Activation Pocket-Card

Goal: Break the cycle of “pain → inactivity → worse mood → more pain.”

1. Notice the stall: “I’m stuck. Pain is running the show.”
2. Choose *one* small action:
   * Stand up and stretch.
   * Step outside for 2 minutes.
   * Pet Foxy or Zonco.
   * Tidy one object (remote, glass, blanket).
3. Do it *now*, not later. Momentum matters more than size.
4. Name the win: “That’s one point for me, zero for pain.”
5. Optional repeat: Stack another tiny action if energy allows.

*(Trick: don’t wait to “feel like it.” The action itself is the treatment.)*

=======================================================

# 🟨 Contextual Reframing Pocket-Card

Goal: Change the scenery so pain has less mental real estate.

1. Shift the setting: Move from bed to porch, chair to kitchen, indoors to outdoors.
2. Alter the inputs:
   * Sound: music, TV, podcast, birds outside.
   * Light: open blinds, step into sun/shade, change lamp.
   * Smell: coffee, candle, fresh air.
3. Pair it with meaning: “Same pain, new surroundings. It doesn’t own me everywhere.”
4. Anchor the moment: Notice one detail (color of the sky, rhythm of a song) and give it a label.
5. Check in: Did the pain shrink in “loudness”? Even a 5% shift counts.

=======================================================

# 🟥 Rapid Distraction Card

Goal: Short-circuit thought loops or pain spirals fast by overloading attention.

1. Shock the senses:
   * Hold ice to your face or hand.
   * Grip something soft until your hand trembles.
   * Bite into something sour or spicy.
2. Scramble the brain’s track:
   * Count backward from 100 by sevens.
   * Recite the alphabet in reverse.
   * Name every state capital, Pokémon, or car brand you can.
3. Flood the inputs:
   * Watch fast-cut YouTube/TV clips.
   * Listen to music with sudden changes (tempo shifts, mashups).
   * Jigsaw Puzzle app, timed mode if available.
4. Label the win: “Loop interrupted. Brain rebooted.”

=======================================================

# 🟩 Grounding Pocket Card

Goal: Anchor yourself in the present when thought loops or anxiety try to drag you under.

1. Physiological Sigh ×3
   * Two short inhales through the nose
   * One long exhale through the mouth
   * Repeat three times
2. 5–4–3–2–1 Check-In
   * 5 things you can see
   * 4 things you can feel/touch
   * 3 things you can hear
   * 2 things you can smell
   * 1 thing you can taste
3. Touchstone Phrase
   * “You’re not mine to carry any more.” *(preferred)*

I could use some help narrowing this down.

My needs:
	•	Size: 15” or 16”
	•	Memory/Storage: 32GB RAM and at least 1TB SSD
	•	Display: OLED or 4K (I’d like this to last 4–5 years)
	•	Workload: I’m a recruiter — regularly open huge Excel spreadsheets + about 30 browser tabs at any given time. Lots of multitasking.
	•	Thermals: My old Dell ran cool and didn’t get hot (only lasted ~2 years though). I had a Mac and was disappointed, so I’m leaning Windows, but I’m open if there’s a compelling case.

Nice-to-haves (not dealbreakers):
	•	Good keyboard/trackpad for long typing sessions
	•	Stays cool and quiet under load
	•	Solid battery life for meetings and coffee-shop work
	•	Plenty of ports (USB-A, USB-C/Thunderbolt, HDMI)
	•	1080p webcam would be great for interviews

Questions for you all:
	1.	Any reliable models in the 15–16” class with 32GB/1TB and an OLED or 4K panel that won’t throttle to death?
	2.	For my use (big Excel + many tabs, no gaming/video editing), should I prioritize Intel Core Ultra / Ryzen 7, or does it not matter much if thermals are good?
	3.	Any brands/models with a known reputation for longevity (4–5 years) and cool/quiet operation?
	4.	If you own one you love, what’s your real-world battery life while multitasking?
	5.	I’m flexible on budget if it’s worth it, but if you have tiers (e.g., best sub-$1.2k, $1.5k, $2k+), I’d appreciate that.",1,1757039132.0,laptops,0,0.99,False
1n8tc8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherWalken/comments/1n8tc8b/christopher_walken_playboy_interview_1997_part_2/,Christopher Walken Playboy Interview 1997 Part 2,"**Playboy**: Elvis is someone you've been fascinated, almost obsessed, with since you were a teenager. When was the first time you laid eyes on him?

**Walken**: I was about 15. I asked this girl to go to the prom and she said she would but that she had a boyfriend, an older guy. Then she took out her wallet and showed me a picture of this handsome guy with the hair, the teeth, who looked like a Greek statue. I thought, All right, and then I asked to see it again and said, ""This is not a photograph. You cut this out of a magazine."" She got farmisht and said, ""Yes, you're right, I did. I'm so madly in love with him. His name is Elvis Presley."" She went with me to the prom. I had her in a compromising position. That's what you get for lying.

**Playboy**: How did Elvis' look affect you?

**Walken**: I saw all his movies. I still comb my hair like his to some extent.

**Playboy**: You played archetypal bad guys in ""A View to a Kill"" and ""Batman Returns."" Are they more like cartoon villains? Way over the top?

**Walken**: Yeah, sure. Those were costume movies. In the Bond film I had my hair dyed an impossible yellow color, and that became my motivation in a lot of scenes: I had a secret subtext, which I never discussed with anybody. Every time I had a scene with somebody I'd be thinking: What do you think of my hair? Do you like my hair? Do you like what they did to me? That they made me look like this? So next time you see the movie, every time I torture somebody I'm really thinking, You see what they did to me with this hair?

**Playboy**: Did you really ask ""Batman Returns"" director Tim Burton for cuff links made out of human molars?

**Walken**: I didn't ask, but it's an example of what a really good director he is. At the beginning of the shoot I was standing with him, waiting for them to light the set, and I said that in ""The Great Gatsby,"" Gatsby and Nick Carraway are having lunch with the gangster Meyer Wolfsheim, and Nick notices that Wolfsheim is wearing cuff links made out of human molars. Burton calls over his assistant and says, ""Get him cuff links made out of human molars."" Within half an hour the guy comes back with them, and I wore them throughout the movie. It's something the audience wouldn't know, but Burton knew it would be good for me to have them.

**Playboy**: Didn't Sean Penn also know what would be good for you when you acted with him in ""At Close Range""?

**Walken**: Yeah, he really scared me. You can see it on the screen, because he did it very quickly. In the middle of the take, he ran off the set and I heard him say to the propman, ""Give me the other gun."" When he came back I was concerned that this wasn't the gun he had left with. Who knows? He's acting like some crazy actor and pointing it at my face, and it really scared me. It was near my eye.

**Playboy**: Why did he do it?

**Walken**: Because he's a good actor. That's what good actors do, they help each other. It was an empty gun - he knew exactly what he was doing. He just wanted to scare me, which is what he did. I got mad afterward and yelled at him, then I said thank you. It's great when actors do that for each other. It's very generous.

**Playboy**: Penn said that you had poetry in your blood, though it was hard to know whether it was angelic or satanic.

**Walken**: That's a lovely thing to say. If you can play one, you can play the other.

**Playboy**: What about believing in one or the other?

**Walken**: Heaven and hell? No. Afterlife, absolutely. I don't believe in death. I remember standing as a child at my uncle's funeral, looking at him and thinking, I don't believe it, it doesn't make any sense. And I still feel that. The other night I was watching a movie on TV and there was an actor in it I really like. Then it crossed my mind that he's dead. But he's not dead; there he is, you know? Life is so amazing to me that I find it hard to believe it stops.

**Playboy**: You sound a bit like Whitley Strieber, who wrote about being abducted by aliens in ""Communion,"" in which you appeared when it was made into a film. Did you get to know him?

**Walken**: Yeah, it was interesting spending time with him. We went to his house once. Talk about eccentric guys. He had about a dozen people there who claimed to have been abducted. They were regular people talking about waking up with six hours missing or with scars.

**Playboy**: You've said he's like a radio show -- he does the sounds, the screams. Is this in a one-on-one conversation?

**Walken**: Absolutely. All you have to do is say, ""Whitley, did you really get abducted?"" He'll pretend at first that he's reluctant to talk about it. He's so bizarre. I asked him what happened once they got him in the spacecraft. His voice starts to shake a little, then he gets into it. He goes, ""No, no!"" \[Laughs\] He does sound effects. This guy, he's his own show.

**Playboy**: You were friendly with Andy Warhol. Did he ever want to take your picture or paint you?

**Walken**: No. Andy Warhol was famous for being reticent, but whenever I was with him we talked about movies, New York, show business. He was very congenial, very intelligent, big mind. He never said anything silly. He said things like ""I believe tomorrow is another day."" Which is silly, except when he said it you could see the mind behind it. I always thought he was rather droll. He was certainly unique.

**Playboy**: Warhol mentioned you in his diaries a few times, often having to do with a reporter named Tinkerbelle. Do you remember her?

**Walken**: Yeah, sure, I knew her. She's gone.

**Playboy**: Warhol wrote: ""She was saying how she makes out with everybody she interviews, that she was making out with Christopher Walken and that his wife was getting upset."" How did your wife know?

**Walken**: I never knew Tinkerbelle that way. I knew her from the days I used to go to the clubs. I used to see her at Studio 54.

**Playboy**: Do female reporters often come on to you?

**Walken**: No. I wouldn't mind, but ----

**Playboy**: Warhol wrote in his entry for January 16, 1979: ""Tinkerbelle said how could I tell people that she'd given Chris Walken a blow job, and I told her I didn't tell anybody, that I didn't even know.""

**Walken**: Look, I don't know, these people, really -- there are things you can say about me, but I'll deny that one absolutely.

**Playboy**: On March 14, 1985, Warhol wrote, regarding you and actor Mickey Rourke the night of Dino De Laurentiis' dinner at Alo Alo, that before Rourke left with some girls, ""he and Chris Walken kissed each other goodbye on the lips so tenderly, it looked so gay. And Chris Walken was really drunk, he said he was tired of his hair, he'd dyed it blond, and it needed retouching.""

**Walken**: \[Laughs\] I remember Mickey was there. He handed me some sort of strange green drink. Actors do kiss one another, I don't think on the lips. I don't think there's anything going on between me and Mickey. Sounds like a nice book.

**Playboy**: In 1973 you said in ""After Dark"" that you thought of Bassanio in ""The Merchant of Venice"" as bisexual, ""and I suppose that's how I think of myself, too. I'd hate to think that I was harnessed to heterosexuality . . . my head is bisexual.""

**Walken**: Did I say that? I think an actor's head has to be not bisexual but asexual. I like the term actor, it's genderless. I call actresses actors. An actor has to see as many sides of the story as possible. That's probably what I meant. But that production of ""Merchant of Venice"" had a gay bent. The director wanted it that way.

**Playboy**: What does your wife think when she hears or reads these remarks?

**Walken**: My wife is so used to me. She's heard people say many things about me.

**Playboy**: Is it true that until you were 35 you never earned more than $11,000 in a year?

**Walken**: That's right. That was my top pay for a year until I made ""The Deer Hunter,"" for which I was to be paid $14,000. But it took longer than it was supposed to, so I made $25,000. I told Michael Cimino there was this great Cadillac that I wanted, but he didn't give it to me. I've always liked Cadillacs, but I don't like to drive.

**Playboy**: So when did you finally make money?

**Walken**: Right after ""The Deer Hunter,"" when I did ""The Dogs of War."" That was the first time I was the main character.

**Playboy**: Have you ever made more than a million dollars for a film?

**Walken**: No. I made a million dollars once, but never over a million. I don't pay an awful lot of attention to money.

**Playboy**: If your films haven't always been successful, your two appearances on ""Saturday Night Live"" have been. What kind of feedback do you get when you do that show?

**Walken**: It's very good, people think it's funny. They remember certain skits. The most popular one is the Continental. A lot of people remember the stalker. We did a James Bond skit in which I played a bad guy. I was designing a shark tank, and I was going to throw people in.

**Playboy**: Do you think the show can ever return to its early glory days?

**Walken**: I don't know. I've been watching it as a fan for 22 years. Naturally when I think about the time I watched every week, it was in the beginning, with Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin. That was an amazing time. When Belushi would do the news and go insane, or do takeoffs on Sid Caesar or do the samurai, or Steve Martin would do his Egyptian dance, that was funny stuff. There was that white-hot thing when somebody gets very big overnight. I remember running around the halls of the Chateau Marmont with John Belushi, who lived there. I used to live on the sixth floor. There were a lot of parties in room 54, which is a nice, big suite facing Sunset.

**Playboy**: Legend has it that the ""SNL"" parties were heavy on drugs, with plates of cocaine on tables.

**Walken**: Honestly, that's like a movie. We had a scene in ""King of New York"" where there was a plate of cocaine, but I have never seen anything like that in my life. It was much more people sitting on couches, passing joints. I don't know if it's still like that. I hear all kinds of things about what people use. It's changed. The pills that put you in an ecstatic state - people didn't used to take pills. And I've heard that heroin is getting cheaper. That sounds pretty nasty.

**Playboy**: Is there a lot of jealousy among your peers? We've heard that you get jealous of men but not of women. True?

**Walken**: Not as an actor. In life, it's a guy taking away your girlfriend. Nowadays, getting older, I find myself around guys who are annoying because they're a little too young, a little too good-looking, a little too sure of themselves. I'm like that with my wife. The other day we had a driver who was a young, good-looking guy. He was talking to her and I thought he was a little cocky and flirty. I found myself staring at him, like, Kid, should I eat you from your toes or from your nose?

**Playboy**: Are you glad that you are not a woman?

**Walken**: I'm glad I'm not a woman for a lot of reasons. Guys have a better deal, that's all there is to it. In every way. It's just better to be born a boy child. I'm not saying that men are better; it's just that men and women are very different. There is no comparison in terms of anything. That whole thing of giving birth? That's a frame of mind that's impossible for a man to know. Getting a hard-on, that's something a woman will never understand. It has nothing to do with more or less or better or quality of mind, but it's like men have a better agent or something. They come into the world with a better shake at a career and all sorts of things. John Gielgud just had his 93rd birthday and had to rush off to do a shoot somewhere. So he's working. That's what I want. I want to do a Pinter play when I'm 92.

**Playboy**: Do you ever worry about that not happening? What is your greatest fear?

**Walken**: I'm afraid of crazy people. I'm afraid of speeding cars. I'm afraid of accidents. I'm afraid of disease. I'm very nervous getting on the L.A. freeways with a driver. They drive so fast that if something were to happen you'd be creamed. The 50-mile-per-hour limit was very sensible.

**Playboy**: What's the most scared you've ever been?

**Walken**: The time I was trapped in an elevator with an 800-pound gorilla.

**Playboy**: Seriously.

**Walken**: Baudelaire once said, ""I have felt the wind of the wings of madness."" That happened to me once in my 40s and I got really scared.

**Playboy**: Did you need professional help?

**Walken**: I tried that once, two or three visits. He was a very nice man, and I said to him, ""I don't think this is the thing I should be doing."" And he said, ""I think you're right."" You have to have a sense of yourself and a perspective on life, sometimes taking a broader view and realizing you can be more daring with your mind, not be so afraid, just dive in.

**Playboy**: How far in does your mind take you sometimes?

**Walken**: That's the problem -- I found in my life that I was the least interesting when I was introspective. I did the least interesting work, I was the least interesting to be around. But a lot of my troubles were absolute bullshit compared with people who have cancer or have had something happen to their family.

**Playboy**: Well, feeling the wings of madness is pretty serious.

**Walken**: Yeah, but all sorts of dopey people go crazy. Going crazy has a certain amount of vanity connected to it. Realizing there's a sort of self-centered, whining thing in you -- just be brave. Somebody said to me once, ""We're all dealt a hand."" Some people get dealt better hands than others. That's why it's no good to be jealous of others. Everybody's at the center of something. The most you can do is to be your own unique self.

**Playboy**: After spending some time with you, it's impossible not to notice how fastidious you are. Are you obsessed with cleanliness?

**Walken**: It's funny you say that. To me it's an absolute necessity. Everybody should be that way. Cleanliness is a good thing. I'm very clean. I don't like things that aren't cleaned up. But I hardly use soap at all. I don't use a lot of soap because it makes me feel sticky. I don't like to use it in my hair -- I usually just run it under the water.

**Playboy**: Which housekeeping chores do you do?

**Walken**: I do most of the cooking. My wife cleans. When I'm in a hotel I make my own food and I clean up, too.

**Playboy**: Why is everything good fattening?

**Walken**: That's not true. The food I eat is good, and it's not fatty. I'm sort of a Japanese-Italian cook. In California you can get Chilean sea bass, which I can't get back East. The Chinese say there's only one way to cook fish -- steam it. I take my collapsible steamer with me wherever I go. I cut the tops of leeks and steam them soft, then lay the sea bass on them and add a little dill, salt, pepper. When you take it out the sea bass flakes off in slabs. Absolutely divine.

**Playboy**: Do you chew gum?

**Walken**: No.

**Playboy**: Eat chocolate?

**Walken**: No. I don't do sugar. It has a chemical effect on me. There are very few things that get me tense. I can drink a lot of coffee. But if I have half a soda I get wired.

**Playboy**: How superstitious are you?

**Walken**: Very. About everything. Not the standard stuff. My superstitions are mysterious and very powerful. They do not have names. I pay attention.

**Playboy**: Tell us a little more than that.

**Walken**: I can't. You're saying don't be mysterious about something mysterious. What I'm saying is, if I have a feeling, I obey it.

**Playboy**: If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

**Walken**: I'd be more entrepreneurial. I'm lazy. I wish I could be more of a business guy. I admire that. I read the business section of ""The New York Times"" every week. I'm amazed by guys who understand how companies are run. Managerial types of things. It's so foreign to me. It's being like a general, which is sort of what directing is. Having a finger in many different pots and pies at the same time.

**Playboy**: Well, we've come to the end. Is there anything you regret talking about?

**Walken**: There was one thing that bothered me, and it was my fault: when I said I'm 54 years old and the only person I know is Harry Dean Stanton. It's the only thing I said that I wish I hadn't because it's not nice to Harry Dean, and I didn't mean it that way. It's actually sort of the truth, but I don't want Harry Dean to take it the wrong way.

**Playboy**: Harry Dean should be honored to be in such exclusive company.

**Playboy**: How do you feel when you read an article about yourself that begins: ""There are lots of spooky actors in the world, but none more spooky than Christopher Walken""? Or, ""Christopher Walken is the creepiest man on the screen""?

**Christopher Walken**: I hope I'm not creepy. Creepy is not a mammal. Creepy is like an insect. Spooky is OK. Racehorses get spooked, they're emotional.

**Playboy**: Still, spooky doesn't often translate into heroic or good-guy roles.

**Walken**: I am a good guy, no doubt about it. Just ask my family. Whatever you are in the movies comes from what you actually are. One thing an actor does in his life is to try to find the pure place.

**Playboy**: So you would like some romantic leads?

**Walken**: I'd like to be acting, and acting in ways that surprise people. If that would be a surprise, sure.

**Playboy**: And how would you describe yourself?

**Walken**: Unexpectedly conservative. Anybody who gets to know me is surprised. My life is quiet. I like it that way. I'm very sensible and pragmatic. If somebody were to do the story of my life, not that anybody would, it would be about my wife and me around the house. It would be like watching paint dry.

**Playboy**: What does stardom mean to you?

**Walken**: I don't know what stardom is. Somebody once said to me, ""I saw you in this play."" And I thought, Wow, somebody saw me, because only about three people saw that play. I felt very famous. I've always been recognizable, even before I became famous. The way I dress, my hair, I stick out a little.

**Playboy**: Would you consider yourself flamboyant?

**Walken**: A little, yeah. Garish. Especially when I was younger -- I was always a bit exotic. Never wore a hat because the hair was more important.

**Playboy**: You seldom get top billing. Why is that?

**Walken**: Usually the villain is the supporting actor. But you know that before you make the movie; that's all decided by your lawyer. Whenever I go to do a movie, my agent and lawyer always fight for things. One will say, ""If we don't argue about the billing it will be easier with the money."" And I'll say, ""Yeah, right."" And then the other guy will call me and say, ""Look, Chris, you have to put your foot down. We have to fight for this."" And I'll say, ""Yeah, right."" So then they argue, and usually they know what I want, which is basically: Take the job, who cares? It's much more important to stick around. Being an actor is hard. So many people want your job.

**Playboy**: It's been said that you bring to your roles a special way of seeing pain that other actors rarely come close to. Do you understand this?

**Walken**: I hope I bring a special way of seeing something. People are so mysterious, you can't ever really know anyone. I never know what anybody's thinking. When my nephew was five and his mother was going to have another baby, he said to me, ""Uncle Ronnie, my mother and father think I'm upset because there's a baby coming. I want you to let them know that I'm not, that I'm looking forward to it, because I've been lonely."" That's at five!

**Playboy**: Are you always Ronnie to your friends and family?

**Walken**: Oh yeah. My wife, people who knew me as a kid, sure. Anybody who met me after I was 25 calls me Chris. I asked my agent if I could change my billing to Chris Walken. It's what everybody calls me, and it takes up less space. It's easier to say. But people don't like change. Producers say, ""If I paid for the full name, I'm getting the full name."" Why can't I go to Chris? I wish Playboy would use Chris.

**Playboy**: OK, Chris, are you concerned about your roles as a bad guy capable of killing children, friends or co-workers? You have said you tend to play mostly villains and twisted people because of the way you look. Do you think you look evil? Is there a concern that you might become a parody of yourself?

**Walken**: You know what I think it is? I've been in show business since I was three, and it has left its mark on me. I come from the planet Show Business, not Hollywood -- I didn't know anything about that until I got older. But I came out of show business: The way I talk, the way I think, the way I look -- those things make me good for certain kinds of parts, somebody from the outside, from the border. When I was young I never knew anybody who wasn't in show business. Remember Brandon de Wilde? He was a great-looking kid and a big star, he was in ""Shane."" I went to school with him. He taught me how to tie a necktie. I was in class with Marvin Hamlisch. I knew him when I was seven. When he was ten he had already written an opera. Tuesday Weld used to come to our house. Sal Mineo was in school with Elliott Gould and my brother. Sal was a bigger star than anybody. He had an older brother named Vic, and these guys wore suits, had bodyguards, played cards on the weekends. These guys were 40 when they were 16. I was always at the edge, looking on.

**Playboy**: Were you jealous of their success?

**Walken**: I don't have a big jealous streak. But sometimes I feel depressed about not being better.

**Playboy**: Did many of those showbiz kids continue like you did?

**Walken**: Not many. It's unusual if they're still in the business. They grew up and had something else they wanted to do. But not me. I got to be 25 and realized I was in show business whether I liked it or not.

**Playboy**: Is that when you made the transition from musicals to dramatic stage roles?

**Walken**: I knew I couldn't stay in musicals. Even if you are great at it, there's only so long you can do it, like an athlete. I was in a musical and a casting agent saw me and asked me to audition for ""The Lion in Winter,"" which was a play in New York before it was a movie. I got the part of the king of France. It had great actors in it: Robert Preston, who was like Booth, a great American actor; Rosemary Harris; Jimmy Rado, who later wrote ""Hair."" It was a good show. Preston was sweet to me. He used to say, ""Don't worry, just enjoy yourself. Don't stand in the wings and say your lines over and over before you go on. You know your lines -- just relax."" And I'd grit my teeth and say, ""Yeah!"" Anyway, I'd go out there and pour a cup of wine and hand it to somebody, and my hand would be shaking so hard that the wine would jump out of the goblet. I really stunk. People would come backstage afterward and say to me, ""I'm sorry."" And one night after the show the producer asked me to get a bite to eat and took me to this Greek restaurant. He said in the middle of our meal, ""We're going to have to let you go."" I said, ""I know that. But give me three days."" He said OK. Within those three days I got my shit together.

**Playboy**: Why stay with acting if it made your hands shake?

**Walken**: What else could I do?

**Playboy**: You won a Clarence Derwent Award for that play. What did this mean to you?

**Walken**: I had gone from tap dancing to getting an award for being an actor in a play I nearly got fired from. This showed me things weren't so bad after all. I got a job as Romeo and I had never read Shakespeare. I'm convinced I got that job because somebody had seen me wearing tights in ""The Lion in Winter"" and thought I could play Romeo. It's dopey, but I think that's what happened. I was terrible as Romeo. And I got the worst reviews ever.

**Playboy**: Do you have many actor friends? When you're working here in Hollywood, who do you see?

**Walken**: I know people here like Harry Dean Stanton. I'm trying to think of who else actually lives here. Oh, Jon Lovitz. \[Laughs\] I'm 54 years old. You ask, ""Who do you know?"" I say, ""I know Harry Dean Stanton.""

**Playboy**: What playwrights are you most comfortable with?

**Walken**: My best work onstage has been in Tennessee Williams' plays and in Chekhov's. American stage actors for some reason go very well with Chekhov. Some sort of temperamental thing. And Williams was the great American playwright of my time. One thing I know about playwrights: Every character they write is them. Shakespeare wrote all those characters, and somewhere in his head he could imagine them. It's the only thing good playwrights and bad playwrights have in common: Their characters are basically them.

**Playboy**: Does that hold true for actors who write?

**Walken**: Sure. I've never met an actor who hasn't written a movie. I've got volumes of them. Cabdrivers write screenplays. My dentist told me he wrote one.

**Playboy**: Did he give it to you?

**Walken**: No. But he wants to. I think I said to him, ""I don't want to know about it. What's it about?"" ""It's about a dentist."" They don't make movies about dentists!

**Playboy**: Has anybody ever read any of your screenplays?

**Walken**: No, because they stink! \[Laughs\] I've got a trunkful of shitty scripts. When I finish one I say, ""OK, that's pretty good for a lousy rotten actor.""

**Playboy**: What was your mother's fascination with show business that led her to encourage you in that direction?

**Walken**: It was different in those days. There was a thing called the Stage Mothers' Society, 300 women who had kids. There were three professional children's schools that catered to those kids. I went 12 years, from the first grade until I graduated from high school. We went to dancing school on Saturdays and it was as much a social event for the mothers as it was tap class for us. They would all sit and drink black coffee and smoke cigarettes and argue. I don't know about what, but I remember big arguments. It was pretty tough.

**Playboy**: Were you a good student?

**Walken**: I was never good in school. I didn't like it and always resented having to attend.

**Playboy**: Why?

**Walken**: I don't have children, and I know the law makes you do things, but I think you should basically teach a kid to read. A little arithmetic, a little writing, but if you can read, that's the big thing. That's the biggest thing my education gave me.

**Playboy**: If you had kids, would you encourage them to go to school?

**Walken**: No, I wouldn't. I think school may do as much damage as good. It did to me. It was just something you did every day. It was taken for granted. You waste tremendous amounts of time.

**Playboy**: You apparently felt that way about Hofstra University, which you left after a year.

**Walken**: I mean, it wasn't Harvard. I was in a play by Archibald MacLeish, ""J.B.,"" when I was 16 or 17. I was about to get out of high school. One of my teachers said, ""You're working with Archibald MacLeish?"" He was teaching at Harvard. She said, ""Why don't you ask him to put in a word for you? You could probably go to Harvard."" I didn't want to go to Harvard.

**Playboy**: What musical did you leave college for?

**Walken**: ""Best Foot Forward."" I was 19, making $55 a week. Liza Minnelli sang a song for this investor -- she made quite an impression. That's how we got the money to do the show. Her mother threw a 16th-birthday party for her, and the cast was invited. I danced with Judy Garland.

**Playboy**: Wasn't it at this time that you met Anthony Perkins, who gave you some essential advice about your hair?

**Walken**: Right. He had a great head of hair. He said the reason men go bald, aside from genes, is that as they get older, the scalp gets tight, the blood gets cut off and the follicles die, particularly with stress. He knew a lot about it. He said that women have a layer of lanolin under their skin that men don't have that keeps their scalps loose. He told me what you do is pull your hair forward five minutes a day, and I've done it every morning since. You take your whole scalp and just pull it pretty hard, yank it around. I heard that Kennedy, when he was in the White House, had somebody come in every day and do it for him. He had a great head of hair.

**Playboy**: What other beauty secrets do you know?

**Walken**: If you've got red eyes from staying up too late you should put warm, wet tea bags on them. It's very soothing.

**Playboy**: After ""Best Foot Forward,"" you did the road show of ""West Side Story,"" during which you met Georgianne Thon. Describe that meeting.

**Walken**: She played my girlfriend in the show, so we were together every day, touring on the road.

**Playboy**: Was it love at first sight?

**Walken**: She was a fox. She is a fox. We loved each other right away. We've been married 28 years. I was 22 when we met.

**Playboy**: Why haven't you had kids?

**Walken**: I never had it checked out. My wife and I were never interested in having kids. We're both relieved that we don't. We've been careful, and we've deliberately avoided it. Until I was 35 I moved around all the time. The truth is, I don't really enjoy the company of children. When I'm with them I think, Gee, I wish this would end so I could have a conversation or something.

**Playboy**: Is your wife your best friend?

**Walken**: Definitely.

**Playboy**: She has said that she stays away from you when you're playing darker roles. True?

**Walken**: She's told me that, too.

**Playboy**: You must not be seeing much of her lately.

**Walken**: There are some roles that are difficult for her. People won't say, ""Come on, honey, let's take the kids to see 'The Comfort of Strangers.'"" That's not going to happen.

**Playboy**: You've said that your character in that movie got to you. In what way?

**Walken**: I did something I never do for movies: I deliberately gained weight, 20 pounds. And I don't do things like that for parts. I don't like to be fat. I felt lousy.

**Playboy**: You called your character a terrible man and said the fact that sex equals death in that movie scared you.

**Walken**: He and his wife did make that equation, yeah. And not in a funny way, like Woody Allen might do. That is the most mentally unhealthy person I've ever played, which says a lot.

**Playboy**: You played a pretty unstable guy, Annie Hall's demented brother, for Allen.

**Walken**: Somebody at a press conference came up to me and said, ""I know why you get these strange parts. It's because you did that Woody Allen movie."" I thought, Could that be? Everybody saw that movie, in which I played Duane, who wanted to drive into oncoming cars. It could be I got the part in ""The Deer Hunter"" because of that.

**Playboy**: ""The Deer Hunter,"" it's been written, established you as an intellectual James Dean. Do you buy that?

**Walken**: No, certainly not.

**Playboy**: Many saw it as a political film, but you didn't. How come?

**Walken**: Because I see movies as movies. But if you want me to be more specific, I don't think it had anything to do with being about a particular war. It had more to do with young men's romantic notions of war, the idea that war's an adventure. They think they're going to go and have a good time, get out of the house. In reality, though, they get their legs blown off. But you could have made that movie about cavemen. It's really more about young men's naivete concerning war.

**Playboy**: Where did you stand on the Vietnam war?

**Walken**: It's maybe not a good thing about me, but I have never paid attention to what's going on in the world. I knew peripherally, but I had no views.

**Playboy**: What about your brothers?

**Walken**: My younger brother volunteered to go, and he went for four years. He was in action in Vietnam. He never talks about it, but I have a feeling he was in rough stuff.

**Playboy**: What did he think of ""The Deer Hunter""?

**Walken**: He's never talked about it.

**Playboy**: How uncomfortable did it get shooting in the River Kwai?

**Walken**: There were little things nipping at our legs. That's why I liked making ""Nick of Time"" - it was all inside the Bonaventure Hotel. You'd go to your room for lunch, go back downstairs and get to work. That's the way to do it. ""The Deer Hunter"" was in the jungle, with lizards, spiders. We stayed in this hotel, and at night there'd be a noise. You'd turn on the light and there would be a lizard on the wall, white with big orange dots on it. I'm very squeamish about that stuff. I don't like bugs. But it got to the point where I'd hear a noise, turn on the light, see something on the wall, turn off the light and go back to sleep.

**Playboy**: Did you ever smoke opium in Thailand?

**Walken**: Somebody gave me some and I didn't know what to do with it, so I ate it after we finished the movie. I stayed in Thailand for a while and went up to this place called Pe Lot. It was like a town in a Western, with wooden sidewalks and guys carrying guns. I ate the opium and got very, very sick. It was an intestinal thing. When I got back to America I saw a doctor, who said that they mix the opium with water buffalo shit and that I had some bacteria in my stomach. It lasted a long time.

**Playboy**: What were the Sixties like for you? Did you go through a drug phase?

**Walken**: Sure.

**Playboy**: Did it affect you?

**Walken**: Yes, but it affected me for the better. It's the reason I don't do it anymore and wouldn't even be inclined or tempted. When it stopped being interesting, I stopped being interested in it. It was a relationship. We gave up on each other.

**Playboy**: You never had a bad acid trip?

**Walken**: Oh sure, sure, and when that happened I stopped. I don't even hear acid mentioned anymore. But it was commonplace then. It's like smoking cigarettes - there was a time in my late 30s when they started to make me feel sick, so I quit. I'm very lucky that way. There's a point where your body and your mind say what you should do, and if you ignore that, you're a fool.

**Playboy**: How good was winning an Oscar for ""The Deer Hunter""?

**Walken**: I remember exactly how good. We went to the thing and there was a little party afterward and we sat with Meryl Streep and her family, then went back to the hotel early. The management had sent up a bottle of champagne, my agent was in the room with a couple of people, I was holding the Oscar. Then everybody left and we went to bed and I said to my wife, with the Oscar in my hand, ""This is a house."" And it was. I was holding our house in my hand - I knew that's what it meant.

**Playboy**: Another controversial film for you was ""Brainstorm,"" which was delayed when Natalie Wood drowned after falling off the yacht that you, she and Robert Wagner were staying on. You have maintained a strict silence about the incident ----

**Walken**: Out of respect for the family. It's not my place to talk about that. The other thing is, there really is nothing to talk about. Anybody there saw the logistics - of the boat, the night, where we were, that it was raining - and would know exactly what happened. You hear about things happening to people - they slip in the bathtub, fall down the stairs, step off the curb in London because they think that the cars come the other way - and they die. You feel you want to die making an effort at something; you don't want to die in some unnecessary way.

What happened that night only she knows, because she was alone. There were four of us on that boat, not three of us. There was a captain too. She had gone to bed before us, and her room was at the back. A dinghy was bouncing against the side of the boat, and I think she went out to move it. There was a ski ramp that was partially in the water. It was slippery - I had walked on it myself. She had told me she couldn't swim; in fact, they had to cut a swimming scene from the movie. She was probably half asleep, and she was wearing a coat.

She apparently moved the boat around, slipped, hit her head, fell into the water. She was discovered separate from the boat: Why would she get into the boat, then get out of it and into the water? She couldn't swim. She hit her head, went into the water, the boat floated away, she floated away. In the meantime, we were sitting in the living room, the three of us, talking. And I remember distinctly that about 45 minutes after she had gone to bed, R.J. went down to her room, came right back and said, ""Natalie's not there."" And then the Coast Guard was called. I feel funny talking about it in such detail, but the fact that she had gone in the dinghy the night before made it sound like we were on the high seas. We were 50 feet off the beach, moored to one of those balls, and there were boats all around. It was a drizzly night, so it wasn't like people were sitting out on their decks. But there were a lot of people around. There was a hotel with a restaurant on the shore.

She had gone there the night before to call her kids because the phone on the boat wasn't working. The first assumption was that that's what she had done. She was very spontaneous. The idea that she had gotten into the boat to go call her kids was not far-fetched. The first reaction was: I hope everything's OK. But then time passed.

**Playboy**: Thomas Noguchi, the Los Angeles County coroner, reported that an argument between you and Wagner may have been the reason she went off by herself.

**Walken**: Wasn't that guy Noguchi kicked out as chief medical examiner for being an asshole?

**Playboy**: He said you guys were fighting.

**Walken**: I remember that. There was a quote in the paper from me saying I didn't recall the coroner being there. How the hell does the coroner know what was going on?

**Playboy**: What was reported in the ""Los Angeles Times"" was that you and Wagner ""argued heatedly aboard an anchored yacht"" on the night that Natalie Wood drowned. ""It may have been the reason she left the two men.""

**Walken**: She left to go to bed. And there were three of us. Noguchi was a bad man. How would he know? If a policeman had said it, it would be one thing. The police thoroughly investigated the whole thing, everybody was questioned. If there had been anything wrong, certainly the police would have looked into it. The story I just told you is the absolute truth. Nobody can know, but I believe she went to move that dinghy, slipped, fell, hit her head and died. Not a good way to go. The woman was not self-destructive. Everybody cared about her. This is the first time I've ever talked more than two minutes about it.

**Playboy**: When did they find the body?

**Walken**: A few hours later.

**Playboy**: What was your reaction?

**Walken**: Oh man, forget it. My reaction was for R.J. to receive that kind of news.

**Playboy**: Have you two seen or talked with each other since then?

**Walken**: I bump into him occasionally, and, you know, it's sad. He married her twice. They really were a glamorous couple.

**Playboy**: Were you close to her?

**Walken**: They were very nice to me. They invited me to their home. We had a lot of fun. To have something like that happen to someone who really was loved and who was legendary - the sadness of it makes it hard to talk about. I was in a restaurant about a year ago, and there was a young, beautiful girl. I was looking at her and somebody said to me, ""You know who that is? It's Natalie's daughter Natasha."" There was a resemblance.

**Playboy**: Did you ever talk to Wood about her early films?

**Walken**: I did, yes. She talked about those people. She had dated Elvis. She was Elvis' girlfriend at one point. She talked about what a gentleman he was. She knew everybody.

I don’t want to leave without saying goodbye.,"I (24M) recently graduated as an international student in the U.S., and I’m set to return to Dubai in five days. My girlfriend (18F) and I had been together for almost a year, officially in a relationship for six months. We started dating when she was 18 and I was 23.
From the beginning, I was open with her about the possibility of going long distance after I graduated. She always said she was okay with it, and we tried to build something real despite knowing that deadline was coming.
But we had our share of issues. We’d fight about things like her drinking, wearing revealing clothes, and even her grabbing coffee one-on-one with her gay guy friends. I fully admit I felt insecure, not proud of it, and I let those insecurities show in unhealthy ways.
She eventually broke up with me, saying I was immature and needed to work on myself. I called her right away, apologized, and we got back together. But two days later, she ended things again for the same reasons. I kept trying. I sent heartfelt messages. She took me back again.
We started talking seriously about long-distance. She wanted to know a clear timeline, when I’d come back to the U.S. I told her I didn’t have a definite plan yet. She didn’t want to move to Dubai or even meet halfway. She expected me to do all the compromising.
Eventually, she broke up with me again, this time for good. She told me never to contact her again and that if I did, she’d block me. I panicked. I texted her right after to tell her I’d stay for her, I’d delay going back to Dubai, but she blocked me. In that moment of panic and heartbreak, I called her older sister (30F), who I’d spoken to before. I broke down crying while explaining everything to her.
A few days later, I texted my ex again asking her to reconsider, but she didn’t reply.
Now I’m five days from leaving the country, and it’s tearing me apart that I won’t get to say goodbye. I understand she set a boundary, but I’m struggling with the fact that a person I loved this deeply could cut me off completely. I don’t want to push her further away, but I feel like I’m leaving with this huge emotional knot in my chest.
I don’t know if I should try to say goodbye one last time or just walk away in silence.

1n8t9nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1n8t9nq/meeting_requests/,Meeting requests,"Hope the sub can help me. 

TLDR: Why all the meeting requests from ‘trial leads’ alongside major conferences?

I am a PI at a government academic research institute in Australia. As we serve a very large and socioeconomically deprived health population, we are generally a very good recruiting site for commercial/pharma trials. We are expensive too. But companies keep coming. PIs like me do these trials for no payment from the institution. We are expected to do them as part of our affiliation with a major research institute. And it gets access to new treatments for my patients. 

Around every conference, I get asked by ‘global clinical program leads’ from the sponsor side (big pharma) for meetings. Until the last conference, I diligently said yes to all the meeting requests. But I never got the point of these meetings. We would just sit and chat about sweet nothings for 30 minutes. They would say my site is recruiting fine and we would shake hands and walk away. I would do this with a few companies a day for the three day conference. 

This next major conference is coming up. Again, my email is filling up with meeting requests from various pharma sponsors of trials I am recruiting for locally. We are the top recruiting site nationally for these studies. I pushed back and said I don’t want to do these meetings with the first junior associate who emailed me. I said I didn’t see the point. I got a pleading email from the ‘global program lead’ to please make time for “a coffee at least”. I have relented and agreed to one meeting. 

I really don’t see the point of these meetings. Am I a metric at these meetings? Am I helping these people tick a box for their superiors? I would much rather just go and listen to some exciting talks at the conference. Or meet old friends. Will I be shooting myself/my site in the foot by saying no?
