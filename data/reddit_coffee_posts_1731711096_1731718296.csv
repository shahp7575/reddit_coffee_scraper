1gsbh8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gsbh8w/i_have_a_crush_on_a_guy_who_im_pretty_sure_doesnt/,I have a crush on a guy who I’m pretty sure doesn’t like me back and I feel like it’s causing my mental health issues to come crashing back,"This is going to be a very big post since I feel like I’m really struggling right now and I really don’t want to regress.

For some context on the mental health part, I severely struggled with my self-identity and confidence growing up. I’ll spare you guys the shitty childhood I had, and just focus on my University years. I’m currently in my fourth year, without ever having been in a relationship.I went into university wanting one, since my high school didn’t have many gay people and I never had that experience, but found myself kinda enamoured by Uni, when it came to all the studying and all the new friends I had made. By this point, being in a relationship was kinda not that important to me as I was content with what was happening in that first year.I’ve always grown up hating my looks and my personality. I had always felt like I was not maturing at the same rate as everyone else and just thought I was immature. I told myself that not being in a relationship meant that no guy found me attractive, and that kinda started to convince me that I was right about myself being wholely unattractive.Near the end of first year, this sent me into a very strong depression. I lost all my friends, my closest friend stopped rooming with me because we started clashing a little near the end of the year, and at the start of second year, school had taken a massive jump in difficulty. I spent all of second year skipping classes, having no friends at university, dwelling in my tiny ass room, crying myself to sleep plenty of nights because I truly hated every aspect of myself.I did, and still do, have a ton of childhood friends that I game with everyday because we’re all split across universities, and when I’m back home, I’ve never felt alone having all these super close friends and my family, but when I’m hundreds of kilometres from them at Uni, it really started to affect me.After second year ended, I had gotten really bad marks in school, not enough to keep me in the Honours program, and I got placed in the normal specialization, along with a very bad home situation the moment I got back, I had the roughest month of my life back in 2022. Along with this, Canada started to have an immigration problem and anti-immigrant sentiment started to turn into blatant racism towards South Asians. Opening any thread on anything Canada-related just had a ton of comments saying vile things towards people with my skin-tone and I took it all to heart because it was the same things I was saying to myself, especially the “South Asians are ugly” comments.

I had hit rock bottom but instead of staying there I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I’m not sure how I did it, but going into third year I had a completely different mindset.I stopped telling myself that I was ugly and unwanted, stopped blaming myself for every little thing that went wrong, and started to have more of a positive outlook on life. I was much more confident with myself, worked on my looks (starting a skincare regimen, putting effort into my clothes, how I presented myself), and started seeing a big improvement. People started complimenting my looks and I was slowly making a ton of friends at Uni. None of them really compared to my childhood friends but it was enough to keep me from feeling lonely. I was starting to get a lot more attention on Grindr and a lot of hookups but they always felt really shallow to me, and dating apps just felt fake.
Earlier this year, I started talking to a guy, I’ll call him Nick. We texted almost everyday for the first week and a half, and then proceeding to hangout almost everyday for a month and a half. We went on a couple of dates, and honestly I was starting to feel really good; I felt like these changes I made to myself really started to work. I always had this thought in my mind where I felt that if this guy did reject me, I would take it as a sign that I am unwanted and this whole new me was just a mask, but when he did reject me and just wanted to be friends, I really did not care. I was never super into this guy; I was just desperate for a relationship. I was telling myself that look, a guy told me he was not interested and that did not hurt me whatsoever.So now, fourth year starts. I start making a ton of friends, start going on a ton of hookups, just all around feel on top of the world. Just about a months ago, I meet this guy in one of my classes, who I immediately thought was attractive. We had talked a bunch that day while getting coffee and was pretty sure this guy was gay/bi. Throughout the next couple of weeks, we talk a bunch in class and I developed a crush. Like not a small tiny little crush, a full, can’t stop thinking about him, having dreams about him kinda crush.The issue is, I have no clue if he even likes me back. He never reaches out over text but always comes and sits beside me in class, we’re always talking during class about random shit and laughing and whatnot, but this friendship is never going anywhere beyond school.For some reason, him not showing signs of liking me back is really started to affect me. I have absolutely no clue why, this never happened with any of the other guys or Nick, but I’m starting to regress into that mindset of “Oh I’m unattrative, unlikeable”. I don’t know why my brain is steering me back into this extreme but every day that goes by, I feel like im just chasing someone who doesn’t like me back and it’s really starting to eat me up. It feels like all this growth I’ve made over the past year is coming toppling down over a stupid little crush.I don’t know why I’m making this post; I feel like im just being dramatic. I don’t even know what I’m expecting from the comments, but I don’t know, I’m hoping someone can tell me how to stop myself from breaking.",1,1731718063.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

7. At 2:30 gently press for 45 seconds.



How i got to this lil recipe:

This lil recipe is brought to you by dyslexia. Last week I got a text urging me to give a recipe a shot. Justin went deep into the Batcave and came out with an Aeropress recipe consistently making his favorite version of whatever coffee he tried with it. A simple approach with logical but unexpected tweaks—drop the water temp and use a better filter.

This was not the first time I had toyed with water temps—Tetsu Kasuya had me listening to Ghost while brewing along to his Devil’s Cup recipe. I even toyed with an Aeropress version for competition, though I never found my way to the sign up sheet. Hot blooms and lower temp immersions just make sense. The yums in extraction tend to be at the very forefront of the brew and the longer you keep extractions high the more you start finding the yucks. So what can we do? Drop temp post bloom so we slow down extraction while still adding to the body—creating this kind-of-percolation but kind-of-immersion experience that, for lack of a better term, slaps.

But here’s the recipe Justin sent over:

12/200

Bloom 50g @ 99°C (210°F) for 2:00

While you wait drop water temp to 85°C (185°F)

Final pour to 200 press after 30 seconds

Total Brew: 3:15-3:30

And it was incredible. By far the best Aeropress cup I had in over a year. But, the problem was, I messed up. I read the damn thing wrong. Remember that 2:00 bloom and 30-second steep thing? Well I flipped those around and bloomed for 30 seconds and steeped for two minutes. Well, dammit—I’m glad I did. Both recipes gave me a cup I’d happily pay way more than my mom could comprehend spending on a single cup of coffee. I’ve found myself rotating between the two. The happy accident is a tad fuller and brighter, while the OG long bloom gives a lighter body, sweeter, and cleaner cup. It all depends on what you’re looking for on any given morning. 

let’s talk about those better filters you’ve already forgotten about. For these you’re going to need a pair of scissors and either a fresh chemex filter or Next Level Pulsar filters. Yeah, that’s right—we’re making our own Aeropress filters because good coffee sometimes demands a little arts and crafts. So trace an Aeropress filter onto these much finer filters and cut them out. They don’t have to be perfect, but just give a little effort. ",1,1731717953.0,AeroPress,1,1.0,False

Yesterday, we ended up on a call all night because he accidentally drank too much coffee and couldn't sleep. I used the excuse that I had just woken up so I could spend time with him. We ended up talking for about 7 hours straight, and the conversation never got awkward or dry (at least in my perspective).

He has a little sister, and he often sends me pictures of her because I mentioned I really like her.We went to a picnic and my cooking wasn’t that good, however he tried it anyways and defended me. He also told me that if he has a crush on someone, he'd tell his best friend (also 15m). His best friend knows I have a crush on him and promised to keep it a secret. So, if he likes me back, he would tell his best friend, and his best friend would let me know whether or not I have a chance. But so far, his best friend hasn't said anything.

I’m wondering, how do guys typically experience crushes? Do you tend to like someone more after getting to know them better, or do you know right away whether a relationship will be platonic or romantic? Are there any signs I can look for to tell if he feels the same way, or if I'm just a friend to him? I’d really appreciate any advice.

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my experience in detail, in case it might help someone. I’m 25, live in London, and am relatively successful in terms of career, education, friendships, and family. I’m lucky to feel loved by the people around me, as we all deserve to be. Nonetheless, this condition has held me back every day from achieving my full potential.

Where to start? In early secondary school, I went through some serious family issues—a trauma which I believe is linked to physical anxiety. It began with a fear of sweating. I tried electrolysis and Botox as a young teenager, but neither worked. I also suffered from bullying throughout school.

As an adult, the issue somewhat faded from my mind, and I managed to cope with it, despite occasional rude comments at university. I adapted by skipping classes and withdrawing from social settings, even though I have a very social nature. 

Post-university, I entered the office environment, where everything resurfaced in a post-Covid world. I’ve been fortunate in my career, working for some big tech companies. On paper, it looks ideal, but this condition has made it anything but.

It’s only in the past two months that I’ve pieced together that the issue wasn’t body odour and sweating but something more complex and troubling.

I’m now waiting for private SIBO test results, and I’ll be meeting with doctors soon to test for TMAU.

I want to thank everyone who has positively contributed to this thread. Advice on soaps, medications, tests, and day-to-day struggles has genuinely made me feel much less alone in my battle to live a normal life. I can share my current routine below, which I think has been helping.

This thread has also helped me piece together past experiences: my first partner drunkenly telling me I smelt like burning rubbish, my most recent partner saying I smelt like Shrek, and my best friends jokingly telling me I stink when they were drunk. It really, really hurts—especially coming from people you love. But I know we all understand this pain.

At the same time, it’s confusing. I do date, and partners ask me to stay over, so is it really real? Or is it just in my head? It’s all so mentally exhausting. 

Every day at the office, I’m hyper-aware of things like colleagues touching their noses. In my last role, the two guys I sat between constantly kept their hands over their noses. That still haunts me.

I’m currently working up the courage to tell my best friends what this actually is. It breaks my heart to think anyone could believe I’m just dirty—that fear we all share.

At the same time, I want to add a note of caution. I’ve almost driven myself to paranoia by obsessively reading this thread. I’ve now blocked it on my phone to stop myself from checking it daily for a miracle cure. I think it’s healthy to step back and not let your life revolve around it, though I know that’s not easy.

Right now, my routine is as follows:
Hygiene:
* Shower
* Hibiscrub
* Low pH soap
* I used a silicon scrub pad to really clean - benefit being smooth skin if nothing else lol
* Apply glycolic acid toner to chest, back, arms, etc.
* Lume body deodorant
* Mitchum deodorant

Supplements:
* Probiotic
* Sometimes activated charcoal
* Chlorophyll liquid
* Oregano oil tablets (new but I think they’re helping a lot)
* Zinc
* Vitamin C
* Riboflavin
* Magnesium
* Vitamin B
* Vitamin D

Diet/Lifestyle:
* No meat or fish
* No dairy
* Low FODMAP
* Try to be gluten-free
* Low choline
* Kombucha
* No coffee (I’ve been drinking oat matcha as a substitute with oat milk)
* Herbal tea (ginger or peppermint)
* Limit alcohol where possible (I’m 25 in London, after all)
* The same with nicotine
* Try to avoid drugs/partying

I’d like to update this soon with any useful information from my test results. This is where I’m at. 

These adjustments haven’t been easy—I’m about three weeks in—but I feel less anxious knowing I’ve made these changes. I recently started a new three-day-a-week office job, and the reactions haven’t been as bad. At the same time, they might just be exercising new-boy politeness. The fear of rejection caused by this condition is so severe that, even if it’s under control, the instinctive dread doesn’t go away.

I really hope this helps someone. I’m not claiming to be cured, but these are the steps I’ve taken for inspiration. Especially for younger people: I know how confusing it is to grow into adulthood while feeling like you’re on the outskirts of society. I see you all and wish you love and happiness.

Take care and stay strong. Hold your head high.

My boyfriend and I have been pretty rocky with our relationship. It all started when he promised me a trip to Yosemite for my birthday, but it didn't go as planned because of his poor planning. He didn't really care about making things up, and just said we can celebrate on a different day - w/o negotiations. This frustrated and hurt me because I am a strong believer of making every soul feel loved, and admired for their birthday. You would think you SO would think to be happy and celebrate the birth of the person you admire BUT he thinks that one day shouldn't be solely on that. I was deeply hurt by all of this, and we have argued about this for two days, including my birthday. I tried to leave, and I know I love him very much, but he told me that I'm not committed and that ME choosing to leave instead of fixing things is not showing commitment or love. Now that I'm taking the time to read this, I just overall feel like my needs aren't being met. I know I have said some things that I do regret, as I'm sure he feels the same way.

We are two different people, I am a graphic designer, and I enjoy art, cute coffee shops, music, literature, pottery, and all the creative niches, I worked at a record store so I'm heavily involved in the music scene, lived in Chicago for a couple of years, and moved back to the bay area. I'm super connected within my community, and love all my friends. As for him, he's obsessed with motorcycles, sky diving, climbing, and all those adrenaline things, he's smart and is a little awkward but that's what I love about him. We both enjoy traveling, dirtbaggin it, camping, and climbing. We are pretty fun, when we want to be.

Yesterday, we had our alone time, he was doing his hobbies and I was doing mine, and we both were happy and content. He ends up hanging out with his friends last night, and I'm super cool with just hanging out at home- because who doesn't love a night in? He seemed really happy, content and cuddley when he crawled in the bed.

As for today, I figured since things went sideways for my birthday, I'd spend some alone time, I woke up early, went to a local coffee shop, texted him daily updates of my where abouts, I had a nice time hiking, just taking some space outside of the house just to recollect myself. NOW this is where it gets very frustrating - I come home(we live with his parents btw) greet his parents, made a sandwich, and come up to the office space where I am hanging. I greet him with a kiss - and he's super monotone asking about my day, no questions, just said ""how was your hike"" - HIS RESPONSE - ""you really need to organize the office because if I want to come hang out in here I can't."" I SAID - ""Sure okay, sorry I was reorganizing things last night, and figured I'd organize it when I came back, everything okay?"" HIS RESPONSE - "" I don't know, I'm just reevaluating my life."" and he storms out. I tried to talk to him to see if he needs comfort and he's just being an asshole about it.

ALSO - he did invite me to hang with his boyfriend's girlfriend - that I have never met, to hang out with them while they do their hobbies and we just hang out there - which honestly it's not the top priority for me because I have a job interview next week, that I'm trying to focus on. We made plans for the weekend and I want to be ready and prepared before going out.

The more I write this, the more I see how selfish he is being. He doesn't mind leaving me at the house all day, while he's out with his friends or doing other things. My mind is racing right now, and I'm truly asking myself if I want to be with him. I'm currently unemployed, looking for work, and he's supporting me. But I have family that would gladly support me during this, but he insisted that I live with him here. I've sacrificed living with my family, friends and such just to be with him and I feel like he doesn't appreciate that. Anytime I do anything with sole confidence it seems like he is triggered by it or something.

I hope another human can relate or help me out so I don't end up spinning on this all night.",2,1731717329.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I hope you enjoy it and I do accept criticism of Shinano's characterization, it's probably something I'm most unsure of.***

***----***

Pity. That's what Cruz felt atop the Sakura Empire's flagship, the Nagato, as they drifted by the Shinano's corpse. Well, to call it that would be a lie, she was in a similar vein as some ships he's heard, like the Amagi once was or the eldest Yorktown sister.

'Sleeping' Nagato described her condition. After all, her ship, once restored and afloat, was merged with the Wisdom Cubes in hopes of 'getting her assistance against the Sirens'. Despite the fact that Shinano's rebuilding started whilst they were still in the midst of being in the Crimson Axis in their war against Azur Lane. Even so, the Kansen didn't return, leaving her as a very large, and expensive, paperweight

It was... kinda sad. Sunken in the middle of an escort rather than in battles. No planes, alone.

Still, it was beautiful, in its own way. Maybe, just maybe, he'll be able to meet her one day.

The coastline of Japan sinks out of view as he continues to watch before retreating into the Nagato's bridge with the Kansen herself.

\---

It all started with a nightmare, not a common thing but nothing to worry about, just a normal part of life.

Cruz grew up in America and visited Mexico to meet extended family, so while he was never connected to the stranger aspects of his heritage, he was aware of them. So, imagine his surprise when he opened his eyes to a shrine, similar in form to the one Fusou, Yamashiro, and the various shrine maidens of the Sakura Empire maintain. Slowly, he stood up and tried to discern his location. ""Where...?"" He started before looking up.

The moon was high, the waves lapping against the pillars holding up the shrine where no land was found, already strange since, to my knowledge, shrines aren't exactly erected in the middle of nowhere.

""What brings you here?"" An airy voice began, surprising Cruz as he whirled around.

Like usual with Kansen, her looks took his breath away, buxom with long grey hair, a pair of fox ears atop her head with long gray hair and a very revealing...kimono? Yukata? He's fairly sure it's a kimono.

Regardless, Shinano, the Yamato-class carrier, and one of the many maidens in the Sakura Empire, looks at her new guest, not anyone she could recognize easily. A strange thing.

""I...was asleep?"" He asks as he scratches his cheeks. ""I'm not sure.""

""Hmmm,"" She hums, her eyes half-lidded, ""Then, would you like to join this one?""

""I'm good."" He waves her off as he looks around, walking to the edge as he looks over at the murky ocean, the bottom impossible to see as he walks away from it.

After a second, Shinano speaks again, ""You...""

Cruz turns in interest, the distance between the two with the sound of the ocean lapping against the pillars drowning out her voice.

Tilting his head, Cruz gets closer, ""What's wrong?""

Shinano tilts her head, ""Your presence... 'tis unexpected. The flow of time has been disturbed.""

""Well, yeah, from what I've heard, you've been asleep for years."" Cruz notes, sitting down *seiza* as Yamashiro and Fusou taught him. ""The war against Azur Lane is over, you know? Shouldn't you be...waking up or something?""

""My dream is long, and so is my slumber, as long as I have a responsibility."" Shinano answers as Cruz tilts his head.

""Yeah, but... don't you want to wake up?"" He asks, as she blinks. ""I'm not saying our problems are over, far from it, but shouldn't you take a break?""

""If you could predict the salvation at the cost of sleeping your life away, would you?""

""Would you ignore the problems in the present that *cause* the problems in the future?"" He asks, Shinano looking at him despite her sleepy look, an intense pressure over him. ""I don't really understand what you're talking about, I'm also not saying we shouldn't try to look to the future, but isn't the idea of one final absolute answer...naive? Possible, but isn't that just ignoring so much?""

""... Wouldn't it be in vain? If all our hard work would crumble in the face of an inevitable ending?"" She asks as Cruz shrugs.

""I'm not big on religion, nor am I some master tactician, but isn't that the thought of Gods?"" Cruz asks, ""I'm just a man, I just want to do my job as a Secretary and get money to support my mother and father when they decide to retire while keeping enough for myself. I mean, you don't even know how I got here. Isn't that a bit more worrying?""

""'tis confusing."" Shinano agrees, ""But, of no problem, my skills are better used here.""

""How?"" Cruz asks, confused, ""You can't talk to anyone, you can't help anyone, the only thing you can do is see the same things over and over. Hoping for a better option. Isn't it about time you woke up?""

""What can I do if I wake?"" Shinano asks, a bit of heat behind her voice despite her sleepy attitude, ""My demise has already passed, my hull an empty corpse floating on the seas by my own countrymen, the Sirens doing so and your own country's ships doing the same in reality, what can such a ship do other than meditate in hopes of finding something?""

""Fuck if I know."" Cruz admits shrugging as he perks up and closes his eyes, concentrating as, a second later, a large green can with a familiar imagery of cherry blossom on the side as he perks up, using one hand to open the tab and sipping while Shinano looked at him. Her expression far more obvious along with the confusion and the almost desperate look in them. ""Your life, ain't it? Weapon or not, you're a grown woman, make your own decisions, but, in my opinion, I'd hate to stay asleep for as long as you have."" He admits, looking around, leaving Shinano to her own thoughts.

She's been asleep for a long time, her understanding of reality and dreams melding, incapable of telling what's real and what isn't through the myriad of timelines she's peered through.

This has been the first conversation she's had in a long while, and already, she doesn't know what to feel.

Then, in a surprising move, he grabbed her hand, ""Well, if this place is like a lucid dream, let's take a walk.""

Closing his eyes, a ripple pulsed, changing the surrounding as it would when Shinano peered into a different timeline, but this time, it wasn't an image she knew.

She was used to sprawling cityscapes, large swaths of land demolished by the Sirens in the various timelines or even the large hulls of her fellow Kansen.

Instead, she was seated on the front steps, concrete steps leading into a small home unlike those she's seen in her homeland. Eagle Union, she believes, so America. It was unlike anything she's seen, it was normal...

Almost refreshingly so.

The door behind her opens as Cruz steps out, smiling while stretching, ""Good to be home."" He says as he ambles down the steps, stopping in front of her and extending a hand, ""So, ready to go?""

Shinano tilts her head in confusion, ""... To where?""

""The gas station?"" He asks, almost confused, ""We're gonna go and get some snacks, maybe a scratch ticket, why?""

Shinano looked around within the dreamscape, a single tug being enough to bring it back to how it was, a shrine in the middle of an empty ocean. A simple order and everything would be back to normal.

Just one...

Her stomach grumbles as the two pause and look at it, their gaze stopped by her sizable chest as Cruz looks away and Shinano fights down her blush.

Even if this is just a dream, the food should taste like normal, or at least she hopes so.

Slowly, she extends a hands as he helps her up. ""I'll be in your care.""

""Let's go then."" He says as she follows after him as he walks to their destination, letting Shinano take in the surroundings.

Lawns with grass extends, sometimes a stray tree or the occasional toy was seen. A car would pass by as the sidewalks alternated between concrete and grass sporadically. In the distance, she can see a field with what looks like a track field and big...horns?

""That's a football field, the reliable figure of measurement used by America."" He says with a tone of amusement, ""It's also where I went to school, and learnt everything I knew about tactics, paperwork, accounting, and beauracracy.""

Shinano looked at him in confusion as she's sure that schools don't teach those four subjects. ""Gambling too.""

Now she's sure that's not taught in any school.

She spotted someone, probably someone from his memory as a spot of interference happened before it returned, the lady smiling at him and waving as he does the same, leaving Shinano a bit confused. ""That's Ms. Antoinette, she was the French teacher for a while, retired a few years ago and last I saw her, was gossiping like there's no tomorrow. If we were in reality, everyone would think you're my lover or something by the end of the day.""

Slowly, she began to relax at the feel of...*normalcy*. She knew nothing, relying on Cruz to elaborate on things as they walked to the gas station, no longer with a duty and simply following him around. Her Cube pulsing as she began to talk with him, the conversation the first she's had in years.

""What is this?"" Shinano asks, peering into an alleyway as she couldn't see through it, minus the red and blue of a police cruiser as Cruz's face fell into placidness, like he's looking at something he shouldn't react to despite how strongly he feels.

""... Just...an event I never grew from."" He says, shaking his head as he turns to her, ""Wanna see?""

A part of her wanted to, it was her duty as a shrine maiden to soothe the worries of her people, of those she knows, of her very faction. Yet...

""...No."" She finally answers, stepping beside Cruz as she casts a final glance to the darkened alleyway, ""Not today.""

Maybe, just maybe, she can enjoy herself here for a little longer. Just Shinano.

Cruz smiles, grateful as the two make their way tot he gas station in silence.

Once there, he opens the door for her and follows in, glancing around at the snacks lined up and the drinks within the glass doors. Shinano follows after Cruz, unsure of many of the products beside the bigger ones as he stops at one of the doors.

Opening it, he grabs two, ""Here."" he passes one to her as she grabs it, bringing it to her bosom before pulling her sleeve over her hands to keep them warm as he grabs one. 'Half & Half' she spotted as she looked at her own. The same one he drank from, 'Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey'.

It was a curious thing, but she quite liked the design and there was a price on the side.

Ninety-nine cents, so around a hundred yen.

She wondered how he'd pay in a dream as she followed after him. ""Want something in particular?""

Shinano looked at the choices before deciding on something she's only heard of.

Instant ramen.

""Sure."" He answers, grabbing two as they go to pay. He rattled a few numbers as the price climbed and he shakily passed a card, swiping it as the cashier hands him some slips and he goes to the side, almost despondently as he opens the packages and lets the boiling water fall in. Closing it, he sighs, ""Wait for three minutes now.""

""Is there a place to sit?"" She asks, looking around before looking back at him to see him seated on the counter and popping the tab of his drink with one hand.

She looks scandalized for a second as he raised a brow. ""Wanna lean against the counter?"" He offers as she looks at him in shock.

Finally, she sighs, leaning against the counter and popping the tab of her own drink.

After taking a sip, she realized that what she was drinking was not actually tea. Despite that, she took another sip. If anyone spotted the two, they'd make for an interesting picture, one of them a mystical fox girl and the other a normal man. If one changed it, it'd look like two young adults simply...

Shinano blinked as she looked down at herself, instinctively changing the clothes she was wearing into jeans and a black shirt with a grey hoodie over it. Similar to what Cruz was wearing with a few changes in the color.

Now, they looked like normal people, waiting for an alarm to go off as it does, ""C'mon, let's sit outside."" He says, to Shinano's confusion as she grabs her cup and follows after him.

The two sit on the elevated concrete by the parking lot, Cruz slurping on his noodles with Shinano as he takes a sip from his drink. Shinano doing the same at a sedate pace.

Finally, they finish their ramen, sipping on what's left of their cans as Cruz asks, ""So, how was it?""

Shinano doesn't answer for a second before asking, ""Is that how they usually taste like?""

""I don't know how this whole dream things work."" He answers, taking a sip from his drink, ""Just that I haven't been home in a while, so I was missing it. So, I made this-ish. Or remembered it.""

Shinano doesn't say anything, sipping at her can as she looks around. Her Cube was at ease, calm in his presence as her worries...melt away. The timelines she's seen, the fates of her fellow Kansen, none of those seem to matter at the moment.

It's a dream, but it was one she'd hold deep in her heart.

""Why do you look so resigned?"" Cruz asks in confusion as Shinano closes her eyes.

""It's been a beautiful dream you've shown me. One that will stay with me for a long while."" Shinano says as she looks at the sky, orange as the sun sets.

Meanwhile... ""You know, we could have another some day."" Cruz points out, ""It's not like this place is some far away dimension or something. It's my home."" He points out. ""Hell, this is fairly standard, but if that's what you want, I can give you that and ten times more.""

He looks out as the sounds began to seem...louder. The whine of sirens, the wind, all of it seems to be...clearer. ""Sure, this whole... situation couldn't be any more weird, maybe our problems will continue for decades, maybe it'll all end, but it happened, didn't it? Forgotten or not, fruitless or not, the little things matter just as much as the big things.""

Shinano looks to the sky once more and closes her eyes.

*The moon glows the same*

*It is the drifting cloud forms*

*Make it seem to change*

""Thank you, Cruz."" She says, turning to him with a lethargic smile, beautiful and captivating as he nearly dropped his drink. ""Change... 'tis a hard thing to accomplish..."" She starts, turning to him almost shyly, ""Would you be willing to assist me?""

""Dunno how much help I'd be."" He shrugs, finishing his drink before throwing him at the garbage can, throwing it in with a proud smile. ""But, I can try. I'll wake you if you're asleep for too long, I'll let you sleep if you want it, and I'll make sure you can continue to do so until the moon's shape changes and after.""

Then, the world around her began to shift, crack as Cruz hums and extends a hand. ""Well, guess I'll be going first.""

""Thank you."" Shinano thanks him, grabbing his hand and rising up but not letting go as she squeezes his hand gently. ""May our fates intertwine soon.""

""Oh they will. I'll be back if they don't and I'll drag your hull and wake you myself if I have to."" He says, letting go as the shrine returns. ""For now?"" He starts as he goes to the edge, and stands on the wooden railing, winking while performing a two-fingered salute. ""Catch ya on the flipside.""

With that, he leans back, falling into the water as Shinano can sense his presence recede as she smiles fondly. ""Yes."" She says to no one in particular as behind her, moons began to appear, small but of different phases of the moon as her eyes glow with power. ""I'd like that.""

With those words, the moon within her dream seemed to glow and so did her eyes.

\----

It's been a week since his... makeshift coma. He calls it that since he was asleep for a day and a half, missing a lot of work and getting right to it, the lucid dream he had still in the back of his mind, doing the thing it usually does and occasionally details would float in and out of his mind. Still, that was irrelevant at the moment.

Mutsuki, the young Kansen in kinder clothes and a yellow hat nods at the man's voice on the other side of the phone. ""He's asking for the location of Shinano-sama.""

""Tell him that I don't know. ""

Mutsuki reports it as she nods at the response. ""He says he doesn't believe you.""

""Tell him that, contrary to popular belief, I'm in charge of all Kansen on base, not out of it, if he somehow lost an aircraft carrier of historical importance, then that's on him.""

Mutsuki relays the message as she gives him the phone, ""Here, he says he wants to talk to you.""

""Thank you."" Cruz says, patting the young girl's head while offering her five dollars. ""Here, go buy you and your friends some candy.""

""Yay!"" The young brunette says, smiling broadly at Cruz, ""Thank you!""

She runs off a second later as he brings it to his ear and answers, ""Yeah?""

The man on the other side began to rant as he ended the call before he could finish.  ""Not my problem."" He mutters, mostly to himself. If the IJN Shinano is *actually* missing, it's Azur Lane's problem, but the fact that the Japanese lost one of their most powerful and significant aircraft carriers in their waters? Well that's on anyone else.

Regardless, he makes his way to the pier where he and Tirpitz usually hang out but pauses as he notices something. Pushing up his glasses, he narrows his eyes at the vague image on the coast line.

Bringing out his phone, work phone, he calls the Kansen on Comms and ask them to hail the ship coming our way.

A second later, he realized he found the IJN Shinano. ""Tell her to dock on dry dock eight, should be empty at the moment."" Discrete too, should give her some time of peace before she has to appear in front of Nagato and Misaka.

He sends an apology to Tirpitz and makes his way over to the dock.

\----

The water is pumped out, letting the armored carrier sit in a dry dock, Cruz waiting, seated on a foldable chair, bag resting by his side, waiting as the Bulins and Manjuus prepare to board and inspect the vessel. Something that was required especially after the Amagi debacle.

Amagi's image follows Kaga's and Akagi's. The two aircraft carriers seeing themselves as his... well, he doesn't really know. Kaga always challenges him in a strategy game (and loses) while Akagi always tries to follow him (to varying levels of success). Which then led to a whole domino effect with the Sakura Empire that he really doesn't want to think about.

Amagi, for some reason, does the same as her two sisters, challenging him to strategy games (the score is 50/50 but she'll say that she's ahead because the first time they played and he cheated, her overlooking it didn't count) and also acting as an assistant to his secretarial duties (she drags him along in the Command Center when the Sakura Empire is out on a sortie).

There's also the fact that she's weirdly... meek? No. Not the right word. Selective? Close. It's just strange that her coughs act up around him the most. Is it a difference in culture? Has to be, most of the Kansen have very... strong personalities. Amagi is no exception, the first thing she did to her sisters after being in stasis for years is wallop them in the head. Granted, his own brother would have done the same if he found out that he and his sister started a war to get him back. Pleased, but the impending wallop would hurt.

His thoughts were interrupted by a dream-like act, the click of her sandals ringing out in the silence, her kimono flaring behind her in the sea breeze, along with her silver hair and tail, small moons arranged around her in different phases as her flight deck extended behind her, wreathed in ethereal blue energy as the bow seems to cut through it like the sea. Beside her, plates of steel materialize, acting as mounts for three katanas as they float beside her.

Slowly, she turned and Cruz's breath hitched in his throat. Seeing it in a dream is one thing, but seeing it in reality is another. The pressure she exuded before was nothing compared to the feeling he got at the moment. Not because it was stronger, if anything it was weaker, but because he could *feel* something else.

Cruz is in no way an expert on religion, that's more his grandmas' skills, whether it be from the natives of Latin America or Catholicism, but he's also seen alien creatures, talked with the spirits of ships, some of which haven't even been pulled out of the schematics, has had some of them *flirt* with him (for some reason, he thinks they could do better), and has had more than one experience with varying creatures of mythos.

Strangely enough, behind her, the actual moon was in the blue daylight sky. It seemed to glow before tapering off, almost as if approving something.

Still, he made a promise, ""You're here, that's good."" He says with a smile, standing up as he walks over to the sleepy shrine maiden fox. He rests a hand in between her fluffy ears as his smile gains a teasing lilt to it, ""I was worried I'd have to lug you and your ship here.""

Shinano relaxes under his hand's ministrations, ""This one's dream had been fruitful, but even a butterfly needs to rest their wings once in a blue moon.""

""'Once in a blue moon'?"" He repeats and a raised brow as he shakes his head. ""C'mon, I don't think Fusou, Yamashiro, or any of the other Shrine Maidens will miss your appearance. Let the Bulins and Manjuu take care of your ship."" He suggests, reaching to his bag and revealing a familiar can. ""Let's enjoy it while it lasts.""

Slowly, Shinano grabs the can, popping the tab and sitting in a folding chair as he joins her, using a hand to pop open his with far more ease than her. The two take a sip as Shinano scrunches her face.

""... This isn't tea."" She notes, despite taking another sip.

""It's American-made."" He answers as Shinano nods in understanding, taking another sip.

It was good, just frustrated that it isn't tea.

""Nagato likes the Iced Tea version."" He adds, huffing in laughter. ""That's a funny story.""

Shinano's ears twitch as she sits up. ""Really?""

""Yeah. It was god-awful fucking hot and the Sakura Empire and Royal Navy were having a meeting about it. Trying to find ways to beat the heat while drinking tea that's been out for half an hour but was *still* hot. I was running late since one of the Destroyers was having trouble getting something, in my lateness, I decided to grab an Arizona and ran there...""

He continued to tell the story of the competition the Sakura and the Royals have with their tea until he, inadvertently, introduced a third competitor. The American Iced Tea.

The two talked for a while until Shinano fell asleep, her head on his lap as he let her sleep, her face relaxed as he prayed that whatever deity watch over her, let her have good dreams.

\----

""Right, this is too fucking long."" He inwardly mutters, one leg numb as he can no longer see the moon, but he can see the sun begin to lower, dying the sky orange.

Gently, he props Shinano's head and lets her rest on his seat as he circles around and crouches, her rigging gone as he grabs her by the waist and torso, raising her a second later in a princess carry. ""Should've told Enterprise, at least.""

Shinano doesn't have a room, and his own room is fairly close, so he might as well. He can always just sleep in the Commander's Room.

So, with ease after the training he's been put through, he manages his way to his home and opens it with a foot. Peeking in, he inspect it.

No Sirius. No Sheffield. No Akagi. Perfect.

With a bit less trouble, he places Shinano on his bed, tucking her in as she breathes softly. He watches her sleep for a second before shaking his head.

He walked off, the building where Enterprise's, and his, offices are located at filled with strange rooms, like a shower and another room. Enterprise already gave him *carte blanche* to use it at his convenience since, unlike Enterprise, Belfast can't shadow Cruz to make sure he's eating correctly, having faith that he can take care of himself and not fall into old and destructive habits.

If only he stayed to listen to Shinano, he'd have heard her calling for him, to stop, even if her face wasn't scrunched in pain. ""The Ghost... The shackles... They intertwine, freeing the ghost of her own for a moment."" She muttered.

After a short walk, a walk he's used to even if the buses aren't running at the moment, he finds the building and opens it.

""Still,"" he mutters under his breath, ""why the extra room?"" He mutters under his breath, a bag with toiletries and a change in clothes in his hand. ""And why at the office?"" He asks, headphones in place as his footsteps are muffled by the rug.

Sure, High Command wanted the Commander of Azur Lane to be human, most likely male, but there's a quarter for the Commander in the base quite clearly marked 'Commander's Quarters'. So, why?

The moon peers through the windows, leaving him enough light to make his way to the office with ease. Opening the door to Enterprise's office, the lights are off, as expected, as he makes his way around the desk, bereft of paperwork to the door.

Without fanfare, he opens the door, not bothering to knock, after all, Belfast wouldn't allow Enterprise to sleep anywhere else but her own room, right?

Cruz pauses, music blaring in his ears as it tapers off, his mind blanking as he watches Belfast, her back turned to him and without her usual outfit, replaced by... well... it was something, as she makes out with Enterprise, neither noticing the door opening.

Well, Enterprise did, her eyes widening as she pauses, unable to say anything with Belfast's lips over her own as their eyes locked for a second.

Damn, Enterprise's getting laid.

He shrugs, Belfast not noticing Enterprise's shock and surprise

Slowly, he closes the door, the hinges oiled so they barely made a sound, sending Enterprise a thumbs up and a wink before closing it quietly.

He walks off, a stupid smile on his face as he inwardly cheers, after all, he knows what Enterprise has been through, this is a good chance for her to unwind and a perfect event to tease her about. First, he should make sure the schedule in the morning is cleared for her before doing anything else then... he'll just sleep on the floor of his room or something.

Still, he's happy for them, a bit jealous since Enterprise and Belfast are beautiful and hot, but hey, both of them are his friends, if they're happy, he's fine with it.

Though, he stops for a second and closes his eyes, he should probably stop thinking of the image he inadvertently saved in his mind. He doesn't think either Enterprise or Belfast would be happy about it.

Once he makes his way home, he pauses as he sees Shinano, tails splayed behind her as she seems to leave a gap opened, her eyes glowing in the night as she sits up. ""... Sorry, I couldn't warn you in time.""

""No comment."" He answers as he reaches into his cabinet. ""Here,"" he suggests, showing him a pair of shorts and a shirt, ""you can get more clothes later. Use these for now. We'll have to announce your arrival tomorrow.""

Slowly, she grabs them as he turns, ""I'll go take a shower."" He says as he enters.

Once he was done, he stepped ou-.

*Jesus Christ!*

He severely overestimated how much the clothes would cover as he coughs into a fist, hiding his staring. ""I'll sleep on the floor.""

""No."" Shinano cuts, a blush on her cheeks as she scoots, using the blanket to hide her body very badly hidden, ignorant to the glances Shinano sent his own body in a tank top. ""Join me."" She says as Cruz sighs.

He should try to argu-. ""Fine."" He relents too easily as he joins Shinano in his bed, facing away from her as he sets his alarm. ""Night, Shinano.""

""... May your dreams be fruitful, Cruz."" She answers as he falls asleep a few seconds later.

The two had an indecipherable dream, as is normal. Shinano enjoyed her first fruitful rest in a while.

\----

""So..."" Cruz starts, smug smile on his face as he leans forward in an elbow in front of Enterprise's desk. ""Belfast...""

""So..."" She returns despite her own blush, ""Shinano?""

""Don't think I didn't notice how your legs shook when you got here."" He points out as Enterprise slumps, forehead on the desk as he chuckles, only increasing Enterprise's embarrassment.

Instead of the teasing she was expecting, he patted her shoulder, a mug of coffee in the other hand and a friendly smile on his face, ""Here."" He says, placing the mug beside Enterprise. ""Not alcohol, and the Ironblood would call for heresy, but hey."" Cruz says with a shrug, bringing his own mug of hot chocolate, ""Cheers?""

For a second, Enterprise stares at him, looking at the cup as she grabs it, sighing, even if she had a small smile, ""Cheers.""

Slowly so as to not interrupt the scalding liquids in their respective mugs, their mugs clink as Cruz says, ""Here's to your relationship with Belfast.""

Enterprise nods, her eyes noticing something as she smiles her own teasing grin, ""To you surviving the day.""

""Hm?"" He hummed into his mug, spreading mist into his glasses and fogging them up as he takes them off to clean them before the door opens as Enterprise takes her own sip.

""Cruz."" Amagi starts, lowly, ""What's this I hear about you sleeping with Shinano?""

Slowly, he places the mug on Enterprise's desk, his eyes looking into her mirth-filled eyes, the two communicating with looks until she closed her eyes and nodded, agreeing to let him have half of the day off. He's gonna need it.

He leaps out the window a second later, a ruckus piling up outside as Amagi yelled his location.

Enterprise hopes that he'll survive. He's a damn good secretary,

1gsb7e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gsb7e4/help_me_pick_out_coffees_for_a_first_time/,Help me pick out coffees for a first time specialty/pourover coffee drinker!,"# TL;DR: 

I want to expose my parents to modern specialty coffee over the span of December. I'm trying to pick a good range of coffee's that can represent different flavor profiles and processing methods. Please help me choose some coffees, preferably from one distributor like EightOunce or Kumquat so it's easier to purchase. I'll be brewing on V60 with ZP6. Thank you in advance!



# Preface:

Hello hello! I will be visiting and staying with my parents for about all of December. They are lovers of coffee but have not been exposed to modern third wave coffee though I think it's worth a shot to introduce them to the complexities and vastness of today's coffee world over my month stay. I have already bought them a Moccamaster and a decent grinder for Christmas to replace their doodoo drip machine so at the end of my visit they'll at least be drinking freshly ground coffee.

This is where I need all of your help! I would like to formulate a month-long coffee flight or tasting plan. I plan to grind with a ZP6 and brew on a V60 03 Switch with Lance's 1-2-1 recipe and Coffee Chronicler's hybrid recipe (I have been practicing dialing in larger doses recently!). I'll also be using TWW diluted to 50%. The goal is to let the coffee sing as much as possible so they can start to learn what their palette prefers.

I'll try my best to get them to cup some, if not all, of the coffees side by side too!

My idea so far is to buy coffees that represent at least one of the followings so they can hopefully taste a wide spectrum:

**Flavor Profiles:**

* Fruitiness/Sweetness/Acidic 
* Florals
* Nutty/Chocolate/Spice

*Processing*:

* Washed
* Natural
* Honey
* Fermentation of any sorts

In terms of constraints let's try to stick to one distributor such as Eightouncecoffee or Cool-Beans or Kumquat (with the exception of S&W because shipping is never free, but prices are low enough that I'm ok with it). 

# Coffees:

I currently am thinking about choosing from these coffees below due to recent experiences or from what I think would provide representation in terms of vastness in spectrum (don't worry, if my parents don't like it I most likely will and keep it for myself!):

* S&W's Guatemala Finca la Senda Hydro Natural - **Red Fruits** & *Natural Processing* (Tasted - fresh red fruit forward, the definition of juiciness)
* S&W's Burundi Kayanza Ninga Giku Anaerobic Honey - **Citrusy** & *Anaerobic Honey* (Tasted - heavy on the lemon, crisp apple, very clean finish and very refreshing)
* S&W's Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Honey Process - **Fruit/Floral** & *Honey* (Not Tasted)
* Dak's Milky Cake - **Nutty/Spice** & *Washed* (Tasted - a spiced warming pound cake with thick texture)
* Dak's Coco Bongo - **Tropical Fruits** & *Anaerobic Washed* (Not Tasted)
* Black & White's Bekele Belaycho - **Rose/Fruity** & *Anaerobic Natural* (Not Tasted)
* Black & White's Esteban Zamora - **Cinnamon/Cooked Fruits** & *Co-Ferment* (Not Tasted)
* Sweet Bloom's Sacuanjoche - **Apple/Grape** & *Washed* (Not Tasted)
* Sweet Bloom's Buku Sayisa - **Lavender/Honey** & *Washed* (Tasted - the lavender aroma perfumes the mouth, and the coffee leaves a honey-esq sweetness and stickiness afterwards)
* Hatch's El Paraiso Amazake - **Nutty/Jammy** & *Koji Fermented* (Not Tasted)
* Hatch's El Vergel: CM Mossto  - **Fresh Fruit/Spiced Chocolate** & *Carbonic Maceration* (Not Tasted)
* Tim Wendelboe's Nacimiento Pacas - **Herbal/Berries/Chocolate** & *Washed* (Not Tasted)
* Tim Wendelboe's  Karogoto Christmas Edition - **Hibiscus/Dark Berries** & *Washed* (Not Tasted)

# Conclusion:

What do you all think? How would you go about making a tasting experience for newbies across a month? Please don't limit your recommendations to the above list; the above is what piqued my interest the most when pursuing yesterday and today on EightOunce. If you other recommendations on EightOunce or Cool-Beans or Kumquat or any other site I'm more than happy to check it out. I'm simply just trying to taste good coffee, and more importantly share this beautiful craft and hobby with my parents. 

# Bonus: 

I am also planning on buying 5-10lbs of coffee from a really solid, no-frills roaster such as Isle or Tandem or Passenger for my parents to drink on their Moccamaster after I leave. I'm hoping they will enjoy the roaster and sign up for a simple monthly subscription. Is there a roaster and bean/blend you would recommend for the Moccamaster? Because my parents grew up drinking coffee in the dark ages where Starbucks was the ""primo"" option I am thinking Passenger's Necessary Subscription would be ideal though I'm also hopeful they will have their eyes opened to these new flavors and opt for their Foundational Subscription or a subscription from S&W or from Tandem or Hex or the many other great steady roasters.",2,1731717243.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1gsb6w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/1gsb6w3/how_to_deal_with_being_socially_awkward/,How to deal with being socially awkward?,"I have always been more to the introverted and shy side, but it annoys me that my social skills are not as good as I want them to be. 

  
For example, today at work, my colleagues and I went for a coffee break. When I put my cup under the coffee machine and pressed the coffee I wanted, the machine filled it up with coffee but no milk, as it had run out of milk. I was confused and didn't know what to do until my colleague suggested I should spill out my cup and refill the machine with milk and get a new coffee. I had never tried to take out the old milk bottle and put in a new one, so that was really awkward having 4 people look at me while I looked like an idiot trying to figure out what I should do. 

I get nervous and awkard when I have to perform something while others are watching me. Any tips on how to deal with this?

I suspected that I suffered from social anxiety, but I have to been to my doctor and a psychologist, and none of them gave me a diagnosis. Even though I might have some traits of social anxiety, they were not strong enough to triffer a diagnosis.  ",3,1731717202.0,isfj,1,1.0,False

Holistic healing?","Hi everyone. I get severe gut episodes of stomach pain that usually last several hours. Nothing really works except a heat pack yet some things that help a little are Iberogast, slippery elm,  ginger/peppermint tea. The last time and only time I went to ER they gave me a combination of anti nausea/PPI and Oxycontin. This eventually lead to some relief several hours later, if i didnt have my heat pack i wouldnt have gotten through it. I even got all the drugs they gave me so I could have them handy at home for the next episode. They give enough relief that you can get to sleep.

These episodes can be triggered by a combination of things such as dairy/oily/spicy food/stress/caffiene. I have noticed the last two episodes were early on during my period which can be a time of increased prostaglandins and gastrointestinal distress.

I have checked my gallbladder but no stones. I have been offered a HIDA scan but i havent gotten that yet.

I had a endoscopy in Sept 2024 and all they found was mild stomach lining inflammation.

Has anyone taken a more holistic/natural approach to healing their gastritis and gut lining? I am thinking like supplements to regulate stomach acid. I have a good diet overall but do have a cup of coffee daily which I may need to reduce.

I also take Asprin daily for another medical condition so that probably doesnt help but I had these gut issues before I had to take it.

Now here's my next 20 reviews for your reading pleasure!

Nocturne Alchemy, sometimes known as ""NAVA"" from when they combined Nocturne Alchemy and VApothecary, is one of the most expensive houses, and I want to point out that you don't have to buy hundreds of dollars of full-sizes in order to explore their catalog and enjoy their artistry. I owe huge thanks to everyone who has sold or gifted me a decant, sample, or partial bottle. In fact, I have never actually ordered direct from the house myself! My *best* advice, if you want to explore NAVA, is to include [freebie sniffies](https://ajevies.myshopify.com/collections/extras/products/accessories?variant=26663602119) in your Ajevie order. When you check out, there's a text box in which you can ask for NAVAs specifically, and if they're available, they'll send you empty full-sizes! There's almost always still enough left to try, and it's been a great (and fantastically cost-effective) way for me to experience so many of NAVA's perfumes. You don't get to pick what you get, of course, but that in itself has been useful because it has allowed me to try a wide range of NAVA's notes, including some things I wouldn't have picked for myself (as you can see in a few of the reviews below). And then I can include these ""empty"" bottles as freebies when people order from my own destash - always great to spread the love!

Since folks keep saying it's helpful, I'll recopy my ""basics of the NAVA collections"" information. NAVA sells three categories of things:

* The [Permanent Collection](https://nocturnealchemy.com/collections/permanent-collection) are those scents they always keep around. PC scents are available in small 2-mls (which range in price from $11.50 to $12.50) in addition to the larger full-size bottles. (This is useful because if you're placing an Ajevie order during a NAVA pre-order window, you can get PCs as reasonably affordable add-ons - this is a great way to try some of the most beloved NAVA scents.) Unfortunately, the vanillas are *not* PCs...
* Which brings us to the second category: [Studio Limited](https://nocturnealchemy.com/collections/studio-limited) scents. SL scents are basically permanent as far as I can tell, but they are *not* offered in 2-ml small sizes. This is troublesome when you're a newbie NAVA fan trying to learn your way around this house but not spend too much money. Ajevie will occasionally decant SL scents, but only when NAVA adds new ones to a given SL collection. Otherwise, you have to buy full-sizes, or seek a friendly decanter. This is where to find the famous ""Vanilla Haven"" and ""Musk Haven"" collections.  has tried and reviewed a LOT of the musks (bless you!).  of Arae Decantery is working on getting a lot of the Studio Limited scents, especially the Musk Haven, in stock as decants, and already has quite a few available for order.
* The third category is the one that seems to turn a lot of people off from this house: the Limited Edition collections. NAVA is a house that runs on FOMO (fear of missing out). Seasonally throughout the year (Valentines, spring, summer, Halloween, holiday, and so on), NAVA releases a giant Limited Edition collection that is made up of two parts. First, the new scents that year; second, the ""Resurgence"" scents, which are (most of) the scents newly introduced in the previous year. Thus, a given LE perfume is likely to be around for exactly two years, no more: the first year it appears, and the next year when it's a Resurgence. You can find a fantastically useful archive of NAVA LEs [HERE](http://www.zombiiesque.net/) (I refer to that handy website all the time!). On the one hand, this is a decent model because you can theoretically sample in the first year (from Ajevie or Arae, or for much faster shipping since they *only* deal with NAVA, [Crypta Obscura](https://www.cryptaobscura.com/); or by seeking decants/samples from this community a few months later) and then buy more the next year if you love it. The NAVA Facebook group contains really useful review roundup posts if you're wondering what folks think of any of these LE scents. On the other hand, this sales model *absolutely* encourages a spirit of frantic buying to stave off FOMO. (""Oh no, this is its second year, the scent will be gone forever, I must buy more than I'll ever actually realistically use!"") The best advice I've heard is not to worry: NAVA recycles basic combinations a lot, so if you miss a particular perfume, chances are something similar will come around within a couple of years.

# eNVie

(From their sister company, eNVie Parfum)

* **Jasmin Saphir** \[Egyptian Jasmine Absolute, Egyptian White Musk flower petal, saphir, Jasmine Petals, Egyptian Amber and Musk Resin, Blue Balsamic Amber, Sweet Papyrus of Cairo, Siam Benzoin, and sweet Vanillin\] - It's quite a golden scent - and the oil itself is a deep orange color - but the heady jasmine, while velvety and lush, is fairly indolic. Underneath it I'm getting balsamic Saphir amber, but even stronger than the amber is a distinct smell of warm baking sugar cookies! Not for me, though. I was hoping for the soft, non-indolic jasmine of **Eternal Ankh Purple** or **Jasmine Musk**. I can't report on the deep drydown because I washed it off before then.
* **Pink Saphir** \[Hawaiian Pikake, Egyptian Pink Lotus absolute, Iris, Tuberose, Honeysuckle, Pink Sugar accord, Plumeria, Sandalwood, Rose, Vanilla Bean absolute,Egyptian Amber and Musk Resin, Sweet Papyrus of Cairo, Blue Balsamic Amber, Siam Benzoin, and pure Vanillin\] - This is an *aggressively* pink and tropical floral, with plenty of the limey aspect of plumeria and honeysuckle and also some pink bubblegum from the tuberose (which amps in the drydown). After **Jasmin Saphir** was much too indolic for me, I was worried about this one, but there was nothing to be afraid of. I really dont get any Saphir; this is a floral-vanilla in much the same vein as **Honeysuckle Crystalline**, **Pikake Moonstone**, and **Orchid Crystal**. (And *much* more expensive than any of those Bastet's Garden scents, and I'm not sure it's worth it to be honest. It's nice, but it's not *that* much nicer, you know?)

# Permanent Collection

**All Hallow's Eve**

* **Halloween 2018** \[Pumpkin Incense, Raw Fig and Pumpkin puree, Tonka Bean, Blue Sugar, a drop of Kashmir, a drop of labdanum, a drop of clove and a breath of white amber\] - Fig-fruity, woody and incense notes, and a touch of smoke. It actually reminds me quite a bit of Alkemia **An Autumn Wandering** \[Sweet maple wood, black currant, damson, garnetberry, charred rosemary, lemon verbena, Japanese pumpkin, Madagascar vanilla, tonka, and sunwarmed oak leaves\], with that same sort of super well-blended (hard to pick out individual notes) effect and the incredibly autumnal vibe, though it's just a touch darker due to the underlying smoke note I'm getting (though perhaps that's the clove or Kashmir red musk?). It dries down to a creamy pumpkin inflected with purple fig, smoke, and bubblegum-like cinnamon.

**Egyptian Sweets, Coffee & Tea**

* **Egyptian Cardamom Chai** \[Egyptian Black Tea, Rooibos Tea, Egyptian & Indian Chai spices; Egyptian Cardamom Seed (organic), Egyptian Clove Bud, Egyptian Pink Peppercorn, Indian White Cinnamon essence, Zingiber Ginger Root Oil, Indian Nutmeg, Egyptian Musk, Bastet’s Amber Absolute, Bastet’s Musk Absolute, Vanilla Bean Absolute, Vanilla Crème Accord, Rice Milk Froth Accord, Rice Milk Crème Accord, and Australian Sandalwood\] - It starts off with a swoon! *So much* spicy cardamom goodness, plus a great whack of chai spices including pepper and ginger alongside the pumpkin pie spices, and Nocturne Alchemy's usual fairly tannic black tea. There's just a hint of creamy milk to smooth it out, but make no mistake, this is a cup of cardamom-heavy chai tea, not a lactonic chai latte. Unfortunately, the drydown isn't as good, at least not on my skin - my skin always eats up NA's cardamom note so soon it's absolutely gone, nowhere to be found, and here it's replaced by a strong cinnamon note that's spicy enough that I kept looking at my wrists with some anxiety to make sure they weren't breaking out in a rash. It's devastating - this one *should* be an absolute holy grail for me and it's not.

# Limited Collection

**Halloween 2024**

* **Lunar Eclipse** \[Vanilla Pumpkin Crème Accord, Caramelized Vanilla Marshmallow Accord, Studio Limited Original Crystalline Absolute (Vanilla Musk), Vanilla Bean Absolute, Mandarin, Plum Skin, White Sandalwood, Rose Petals, Tonka Bean, French Vanilla, Caramelized Cinnamon, and Nutmeg\] - In the vial, all I smell is buttery popcorn! On my skin, it immediately transforms into thick, sticky caramel, and after a second, an incredibly creamy pumpkin-vanilla kicks in as well. I get no florals or fruit at all. At first I didn't get any pumpkin spice, but as it dries down, those get quite strong as well, creating a thick, luscious, caramel-drenched pumpkin spice-vanilla, so much like a pumpkin spice latte with extra caramel and vanilla syrups save for the fact that there's no coffee/espresso here. It reminds me of **Little Book Eater Sleepy Hollow** \[Pumpkin, ginger, cinnamon, mahogany, amber, and sandalwood\] and also of **Arcana Pumpkins Crave Pointe Shoes** \[Creamy pumpkin and sweet Korintje cinnamon with Arcana Wildcraft’s Two Finger Ballet (a delicate blend of French vanilla crème, white amber, sugared vanilla beans, caramel, and the smallest dab of opium)\] - it shares their sticky, super-gourmand, creamy pumpkin vibes. Too gourmand for my taste, but I can see this being a huge hit with folks who like the more desserty scents. Don't let the buttered popcorn vial sniff (I'm not the only one who has reported that!) put you off! It becomes all pumpkin-caramel-vanilla-spice goodness once applied.
* **Masquerade Moon Thoth** \[Neroli Accord, Jasmine Petals, Studio Limited Original Moonstone (African White Vanilla Bean with Crystalline (Vanilla Musk), eNVie saphir (Egyptian Amber & Musk Resin purified into natural notes of blue balsamic Amber, sweet papyrus oil from Cairo and Siam benzoin), and Vanilla Ice Cream Accord\] - A creamy, musky vanilla-floral. NA's neroli often has a sharp bitter green opening on my skin, but this one is truly just the fragrant orange blossom (reminding me of Nui Cobalt's **Somniphilia (Love of Sleep)**), paired with a lactonic jasmine that is less tropical and ever so slightly more indolic than the sort of jasmine in **Jasmine Musk** and **EA Purple**. The vanilla base is milky and buttery, smelling less of rich Bastet's Ice Cream now after resting than it did on the day this scent first arrived. It's a rich, decadent floral, a little more thick than the lighter and more airy florals I tend to prefer for spring, so this might be a summer scent for me (though it might be too rich for especially warm and humid days). It dries down to a creamy, extremely milky (but not musty) vanilla with a strong (and now quite limey and not at all indolic, hooray) jasmine, plus a hint of light pink-bubblegum tuberose. The longer I wear it, the more I love the drydown - that Moonstone plus floral is giving it a really similar vibe to my beloved **Alchemist Chamomile**. I was thinking this might be too lactonic for summer wear, but now I'm thinking it'll be an absolutely brilliant summer bedtime perfume - and so when an Ajevie leftover became available, I happily snapped it up!

**Halloween 2023**

* **NEFER (Beauty/Beautiful)** \[Egyptian Jasmine, Rose Petals, eNVie saphir absolute, Bastet’s Amber, Golden Labdanum absolute, and Indian Jasmine Petals\] - It's actually not too different from **Jasmin Saphir** with its robust jasmine and golden aura, but this particular jasmine note is more like that of **Jasmine Musk** and **EA Purple** (fully non-indolic, unlike **Jasmin Saphir**, and much bolder than **Jasmine Musk** or **EA Purple**). Joining the jasmine are a touch of red rose and an almost metallic golden effect, probably from the labdanum. I'm not getting much balsamic Saphir though I'm sure it's contributing to that gold aura. **NEFER** and **WASIM** \[New Orleans Summer Jasmine, Rose essence, Australian Sandalwood, Neroli essence, eNVie saphir absolute, and Bastet’s Amber\], which came out together in the same subset, are both made up of rose and a bold jasmine, but the proportions are opposite - **WASIM** was mostly rose with a touch of jasmine, while here **NEFER** is the other way 'round. It's not going to join my permanent collection because it's so powerful - I like my spring and summertime florals more light & ethereal. But it is really well-done.

**Thoth's Archive 2023 (Halloween in July)**

* **Skeletonic** \[White Birch, Tonka Bean, Vetiver essence, Birchwood, Bastet’s Musk Absolute, Black Styrax\] - It's a very clean, white wood, really pure and untamed, with no sweetness or warmth to it (instead, a clean, juicy undertone of something like cucumber). There's no vanilla or sandalwood here, but the base of Bastet's Musk gives it a peaceful, silky-smooth feel. Husband, who loves woodsy scents, snaffled this one.
* **Squid's Ink** \[Black Rose Petals, Lemon Zest, Raspberry, Strawberry, White Sandalwood, Moonstone (Studio Limited) Absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute\] - Jammy rose petals and a strawberry-orange fruitiness - it's really delightful! In the vial it smells fairly serious and dark, the rose petals quite solemn and sophisticated, but on my skin the fruit blooms beautifully and gives it such a bright cheerfulness. The drydown is fairly similar to **Poesie Coquette** \[Rose jam laced with cardamom, sandwiched between marshmallow meringues, and served next to a cup of black tea, dreamwood and pink musk\], though of course without the cardamom, and with a cheerful lemony citrus note. This is going to be a gorgeous ""transition from summer to fall"" scent for me.

**Summer 2021**

* **RS: Sandalwood Jasmine** \[Royal Jasmine: Jasminum grandiflorum, Arabian Jasmine: Jasminum sambac, Pink Jasmine: Jasminum polyanthum, Black Cardamom, Red Indian Sandalwood, Jasmine-Musk accord, a tiny bit of aged Bastet’s Amber absolute, aged White Sandalwood in a bourbon Oakwood barrel with one swimming black clove\] - This scent is quite robust and woody, fairly somber and almost intimidating (like a really sophisticated, terrifyingly put-together boss). It's quite a different approach to jasmine than **EA Purple** or **Ghost Velvet**. I can definitely see the similarities to **RS Plumeria**, that full-bodied, woody sandalwood paired with a floral strong enough to stand up alongside it. It also feels like a close cousin to **Jasmine & Tibetan Crystalline** \[Indian Jasmine Accord, Egyptian Jasmine Absolute, Studio Limited Originals Tibetan Crystalline (Deep incense of Tibetan Champa, Tibetan Sandalwood, Australian Sandalwood, Nepalese Sandalwood, White Sandalwood, Santalum Absolute, Siam Benzoin Resin, and Amber Henna, Davana, Tibetan Musk, Nepalese Sugandh Kokila, Plumeria, Bastet’s Amber, and soft spirals of pure eNVie Saphir Amber essence), Studio Limited Originals Crystalline Absolute, and Bastet’s Musk Absolute\], with a similar sort of darkened, elegant quality, though here it's deep sandalwood instead of deep incense.

Holiday 2019

* **Private Universe** \[NA Oudh agarwood, Santalum sandalwood absolute, Cardamom, Teakwood, Cedarwood, White Patchouli, Black Clove and eNVie saphir amber musk\] - A dry, woody sandalwood and soft, non-gourmand cardamom meld with a prominent oud. It's actually quite a nice oud - not barnyard-stinky nor bbq-y, more a firey brimstone smoke, and rather gentle as oud goes, just quite prominent in the scent overall. This is definitely an oud-forward perfume, and since I'm not generally that into oud - I'd been hoping this would be cardamom-sandalwood with just a touch of oud - this'll go to my destash. Longevity is amazing.

**Valentine 2019**

* **Under the Ivy** \[Ivy Accord, Honeysuckle Extract, Lilac, eNVie parfume saphir absolut and White Rose Petals\] - Oh happy day, another NA honeysuckle! In a rare case of good fortune, I adore this note *and* it happens to be one that my skin seems to amp (quite a lot, actually - even **Parisian Musk** \[Lily of the Valley accord, Muguet Musk accord, eNVie saphir absolute, Honeysuckle extraction, Honeysuckle sugar accord, Bastet’s Musk absolute and White Musk\] is mostly honeysuckle on me). Here it's that bright, slightly tropical honeysuckle with a light touch of greenish ivy and faint (non-soapy) lilac, and a drop of balsamic Saphir amber. I get no rose whatsoever (but that's okay with me). It's not an aquatic by any means, but I could almost describe this as having a touch of ""water musk"" or something - this scent feels like a soft wash of watercolor paint.

**Spring 2018**

* **Romeo & Juliet** \[Sacred Kyphi essence, Pear Skin, Bastet’s Amber, Crystalline Absolute, White Patchouli, Incense Dust, Labdanum, Cedar and Teak Wood\] - …Boozy chocolate covered raisins and cherries? There is no chocolate listed, but it's so very present in the opening! The undeniable chocolate note dies away pretty quickly, revealing itself to be white patchouli + vanilla + wood + some sort of musty graveyard dirt/incense thing, along with raisin and (now it makes itself known) a slightly dried pear. Throw is VERY strong with this one. I was all set to immediately destash this scent on account of the opening, but actually...I might like this drydown? Not enough to keep a FS bottle, though. Do you ever have that differing standard for keeping samples vs. a FS?

**Holiday 2017**

* **Amber Velvet** \[Decadent NAVA Amber 23 (23 different ambers), Amber Resin Absolute, a drop of Ozy Amber Absolute then hand blended into the NAVA Velvet Accord \*Velvet Blend: Eternal Ankh, Jasmine, Vanilla bean, and musk all weave the scent of Eternal Ankh Vanilla Absolute\] - Oh my *goodness* \- a vanillic, sugared amber (and I get hints of their resinous, slightly balsamic-sour Ozymandias amber too), with a waft of the ethereal sweet jasmine of the Velvet accord. It's a different effect than something like **Deep Midnight Seven Veils** \[Madagascar Vanilla, Orchids, White Florals, Sweet Golden Amber, Spices\], because it lacks spices but more importantly, because this airy jasmine is so different than the syrupy vanilla orchid. **Amber Velvet** is such a, well, *velvety* scent - plush yet soft and delicate. I absolutely adore it ! It does have lower longevity than I would have expected (but it's totally worth having to reapply it later in the day). Here's a plea to the universe (or, well, to NA) to please bring the Velvets back!
* **Blue Velvet** \[Our velvet\* blend with Blueberry Essence, Blue Vanilla NAVA Accord and Blue Sandalwood. A scent told by a Victorian ghost sitting in his amber velvet chair as a blue velvet curtain moves in the wind from the open window. \*NAVAliday Velvet: Using one of our favorite perfumes, Eternal Ankh and focusing the attention on subtlety, we started fresh and wove our way into a plume of velvet cavalcade. Victorian velvet ghost-like Jasmine, vespers of Vanilla bean, soporific musk all weave the scent of Eternal Ankh Vanilla Absolute (note not the other components of Eternal Ankh, only the vanilla that makes E Ankh what it is), only the haunting notes and then by adding specific blend techniques the main caricature personifies each of the velvets. Dusty, sensual and haunted\] - It first arrived and I gave it a sniff straight out of the mail, and literally *gasped*, it was so soft and blue and lovely. It really does smell ""blue""! I was so eager to first-test it, and saved it until I could wear a floaty blue summer sundress with it. And then on my skin, it became SO obvious that the ""blue"" was blueberry. And, boo, a strongly artificial blueberry, in my husband's words, ""like when you open up a packet of blueberry muffin mix."" At this point, I was bummed (it really had smelled *so* pretty in the vial), but because I didn't love it more than the blue florals of **Nui Cobalt Bees Love Blue** or the blueberry-florals of **Arcana Miss Skiffins** or **Blueberries Crave Goblin Sharks**, I decided I'd destash **Blue Velvet**. And yet...the deep drydown is really rather stunning, a quiet blue-hued jasmine musk with a hint of pink sweetpea and an indistinct vanilla-sandalwood base. It's absolutely worth it to sit through the artificial blueberry beginning.

**Halloween 2017**

* **Sleep Elixir** \[White Muguet, Crystalline Vanilla Absolute, White Musk, Blue Sage, Black Chamomile and a touch of Bulgarian and French Lavender Absolute nestled in a bowl of black salt to ward off the bad dreams and help ease into a peaceful state before sleep\] - Sage, chamomile, and lavender combine for a soothing evening blend. It's fairly herbal, but less sharp and astringent on my skin than it smells in the vial, because the lovely muguet (which I don't smell at all in the vial) comes out on my skin to cast a gauzy white floral veil over all the herbs. It's sort of similar to **Nui Cobalt Peace** \[Bulgarian lavender and honey are tucked into a soft bed of cooling clary sage and meditative sandalwood\] if you squint at it, but where **Peace** feels like a pristine, clean cup of lavender tea, this has more going on. After several weeks of occasional vial sniffs, I was prepared not to like this one much, thinking it would be nothing but very sharp herbal lavender, but the floral haze really does bring this scent to the next level. I did end up putting on **Lavender Dolphin** (see below) when this faded before bedtime, and since I like that one a touch more, I passed **Sleep Elixer** to a perfume friend who is very into NA's muguet.

**Spring 2016?**

* **Evening Star** \[Crushed Jasmine and Crushed Violet, Egyptian Rose de Mai Absolute, Nutmeg, California Redwood, Raw Papaya Seed, Arabian Cedarwood, Bastet's White Amber, Champagne Musk and Chrysanthemum star petals\] - This is a really interesting one, a pretty woodsy-floral in the vial, but something about it goes a little wrong on my skin. Something - maybe the nutmeg or the champagne musk or the redwood? I honestly can't tell; these are all notes I'm not familiar with from NA - gets musty and just a little bit urinous, and it's such a shame because the floral and cedar notes entwine so beautifully here.

**Valentine 2016**

* **Lavender Dolphin** \[Lavender Dolphin is filled with the dreams of Lavender but softened by the essence of Crystalline and White Sandalwood. The vanilla swims through the lavender and blends softly with a sensual VA Snow Musk at the heart of the Dolphin\] - Nocturne Alchemy's lavender is usually pretty herbal, and this is no exception, but it's softened by vanilla, an extremely gentle white sandalwood musk, and a hint of sugar crystals for sweetness. I like this more than **EA Purpurite**. Lavender/vanilla is a pretty standard pairing, but this one is exceptionally lovely. I feel so fortunate to have found it in a destash, because it's very old and wildly popular. I've had **Blue Chamomile Lavender Dolphin** on my ISO list forever because I *adore* NA's blue chamomile - and I doubt I'll ever, ever find it - but I think **Lavender Dolphin** could be a stunning approximation with a drop or two of **Alchemist Chamomile** added (must remember to try that combo!)
* **Love of Bastet Pink Vanille** \[Pink Orchard Peach, Apricot Petals and Pink Apricot Nectar of Benhama, Kashmir. A drop of Pink Crystalline, Pink Crystal Vanilla, Pink Egyptian Musk, a kiss of Pink Sugar and Pink Peppercorn\] - Suuuuper pink, a girlish, sugary pink not unlike **EA Pink** or **Pink Quartz**, though certainly with less red musk than **Pink Quartz**. With it, and what makes it noticeably different than **EA Pink**, is a vivacious, juicy apricot note and just a hint of velvety white floral petals - I'm not sure I'd call them ""apricot petals"" (is there such a thing?) but perhaps pink sweetpea. It's actually somewhat similar to **Nui Cobalt All Dolled Up** \[Spiced apricot preserves, almond blossom, pink peony, Hawaiian and Australian sandalwoods, balsam of Peru, and sunlit amber\], though that one has much more clove and is less light and sweet. This scent almost waxes a little juvenile, but it's so much fun in summertime wearing a hot pink floral dress. 

**Summer 2015**

* **Prometheus** \[Egyptian Musk Absolute (from the white Egyptian Musk flower), Italian Lemon-Sugar, Indian Cardamom Pod, Ginger and NA Kyphi Incense, Raisin Wine, Blue Amber, White Italian Lime, Santalum White, Alexandrian Sea Salt and a touch of Caramel infused Blue Sugar\] - Hmm, my impression of this is a little different than the notes. Without seeing the description, I named this as honey, spices, lemon, and sandstone. I can see now that the honey-sandstone effect must be the Egyptian musk, which is more a golden skin scent than a heavy, overpowering, caramel-y musk (as Egyptian musk can sometimes be). But this scent is still a little too heavy on the honeyed musk and warm sand to be a true love for me.",2,1731717115.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,0.75,False

1gsb4vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1gsb4vu/fiber_on_udm_pro_help_needed/,"Fiber on UDM Pro, help needed","In short:
Hi, I need some help regarding how to connect and setup my dream machine for ""fiber"" and what SPF module to buy.

Long: I'm living in Belgium and our house has recently been connected to the network of Fiberklaar, not an ISP but a net distributer that is currently connecting the whole country to fiber.

I currently have a modem from ""Telenet"" which is in pass-through mode, plugged into rj45 WLAN port 9 of my udm pro.

Multiple ISP's have hopped on the fiber train and now offer fiber connections. 1000/500, 2500/1000, 5000/1000 and 8500/1500 Mbps are the most interesting options, especially 2500/1000 seems interesting to me.

As of the start of the month (1 Nov 2024) all ISP's in Belgium are by law required to allow self owned routers, and modems. Now this is where my knowledge ""ends"".

To use your own router it needs to support:
- Be able to build a PPP- connection.
- Support VLAN 10-tagging.
- Have a (10) gigabit ethernet module (otherwise speed limited to 1Gbps)

My questions:
- I assume the UDM pro supports the first 2 requirements? Can anyone confirm?
- Am I right in my understanding that the WLAN 9 or 10 rj45 port on the dream machine only support up to 1Gpbs and that 10Gbps is only available with an SPF (+?) module or do the RJ45 ports support 10Gbps as well?
- IF only over SPF module, which one to buy? I assume it matters? What are the differences?
- I stumbled upon an 4 year old reddit thread here in ubiquiti where people seemed to state that it is eighter 1gpbs or 10, but nothing in between except with a specific combination of self bought modem + SPF module. Is that correct because if so I would assume taking a +1Gbps subscription would make no sense? Or did I misunderstood that.
- As far as I understand the UDM pro is only a router right? So I do need my ISP's modem to get the connection working or is there a way to plug in the fiber line directly in my UDM pro with the correct fiber SPF connector and make it work?

For the real experts: on this page of one of the ISP's there are documents regarding the technical requirements of the router and modems for self-owned devices: https://www.fastfiber.be/support/vanaf-1-11-2024-je-eigen-modem-gebruiken-die-niet-ondersteund-wordt-door-fastfiber/ They make no sense to me but might help an expert to answer my questions

Thanks a lot for any information that might help me understand this better. Feel free to dm me if you're an expert on this and I would gladly buy some coffee's. Point is that I just for once don't want to spend days of self research trying to understand it and hope to do/buy the correct things. I have lot's of other stuff on my mind atm and I just want to get connected at high speed and be done with it so I can focus on other things.

Thanks Reddit, appreciate you all.

What Jesus teaches about Love and truth

Introduction
------------

In a world filled with noise and distractions, we often find ourselves yearning for clarity and purpose. What if I told you that the key to finding this is love and truth, two intertwined virtues that Jesus eloquently teaches us through His life and words? These are not mere concepts, but powerful forces that can illuminate even the darkest paths and transform our hearts.

Join me today in exploring the profound teachings of Jesus on love and truth. Through this devotional, may you be inspired to let these virtues guide your thoughts, words, and actions. Feel the warmth of His love embrace you and the liberating power of His truth set you on a course of authenticity and grace. So, grab a cup of coffee, find a cozy corner, and let’s embark on this soul-refreshing journey together.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'” – John 14:6 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

In John 14:6, Jesus encapsulates the essence of His mission: to lead us to the Father through His embodiment of truth and love. By declaring Himself as “the way, the truth, and the life,” Jesus is offering us a path that is deeply rooted in authenticity and genuine compassion. Love and truth are not just attributes of Jesus; they are His very nature.

To understand this fully, picture a compass. Just as a compass points to true north, Jesus points us towards the truth — a truth that is absolute, unwavering, and deeply connected with love. In a society that often promotes relative truths and superficial connections, Jesus invites us into a deeper relationship defined by commitment, sincerity, and unconditional love.

Furthermore, this love is not passive; it calls for action. True love, as modeled by Jesus, actively seeks the well-being of others, even at personal cost. Similarly, truth is not merely about stating facts but about living authentically and transparently. When we align our lives with these virtues, we begin to reflect Jesus’ light and love to the world.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Practice active listening and empathy in conversations to strengthen your relationships with love and truth.

– Seek reconciliation and forgiveness in areas where misunderstandings have clouded the truth and love in your relationships.

– Dedicate time daily to read and meditate on the teachings of Jesus, allowing His love and truth to shape your life.

– Share truthful and loving encouragements or affirmations with those around you.

– Challenge any false narratives in your life by affirming your identity in Christ, rooted in truth and love.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– How has Jesus’ definition of love and truth influenced your relationships?

– Reflect on a time when embracing truth led to a breakthrough in your personal life or relationships.

– In what areas of your life do you find it challenging to practice both love and truth? Why?

– How can you better embody Jesus’ love and truth in your daily routines?

– Write a prayer asking for strength and guidance to live in love and truth.

Prayer
------

Dear Jesus,

Thank You for being the ultimate source of love and truth in my life. Help me to reflect Your love and truth in my words and actions. Grant me the courage to live authentically and the grace to extend compassion to others. May Your truth light my path and Your love fill my heart, guiding me closer to You each day. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

Conclusion
----------

As we close this devotional, let us be mindful of the incredible value love and truth bring to our lives. Inspired by Jesus’ teachings, these virtues have the power to deepen our relationships, clarify our purpose, and illuminate our paths. By choosing to walk in truth and love, we align ourselves with Jesus, inviting His transformative presence into our daily lives.

1gsb1si,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gsb1si,"Bad Mother - St Pete, Fl","With Monday wide open, I did what any self-respecting borderline-psychopath would do—drove two hours to sip from one of the best. That shop? Bad Mother, tucked inside the Station House in downtown St. Pete, a coworking spot that feels more like a creative playground, filled with other small shops and plenty of seating.

The space hums with good energy. It’s easy to get work done here, though I’ll admit I missed bar seating. There’s something about perching up close, watching baristas make their magic. Bad Mother seems to get it too—once a month, they host Slow Bar Sundays at the bar. It’s proof the setup can happen, just not every day

The music? I don’t even remember it, which is the best compliment I can give. It didn’t drown the room, didn’t interrupt the flow. My friends and I could talk across the table without shouting. 

Where Bad Mother really flexes is in branding and presentation. The owner, Chris, has a design background, and you can tell. Every detail feels intentional, from the tasting cards paired with every pour-over to the bold, unapologetic name. It all works, curating not just a cup of coffee but a relationship with the person sipping on it.

And then there’s the coffee. Four pour-over options: one from Sey, two from Black & White and one from La Cabra. I went with Gummy Worms from Black & White and dry-fermented honey Ethiopia from Sey. Both hit, but Gummy Worms stole the show. This blend of different process coffees is a ride—funky, bright, unforgettable. Maybe not an everyday brew, but perfect for a slow afternoon, editing photos and shooting the shit with friends.

They brew all of their filter coffees on the Hario Switch, a personal favorite. Method is straightforward: bloom, steep, and tweak the steep time based on the coffee. It’s simple, precise, and consistent.

Onto the spro. They had Danche from Black and White dialed in—and to no one who has read this far’s surprise—it was incredible. Sweet and lightly acidic, like a polite punch to the mouth hole.

Bad Mother isn’t just a Florida standout—it’s one of the best in the country. I’d drive hours for this. The coffee, the atmosphere, the whole experience—worth every mile.",4,1731716778.0,pourover,4,1.0,False
1gsb0df,https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/1gsb0df/some_brief_thoughts_on_classic_bond/,Some brief thoughts on classic Bond,"I've started watching all the Bond movies, from Dr. No onwards.  It's taken a fortnight, but I've reached Never Say Never Again and completed what I think of as the ""classic"" era. 

While I'm reasonably sure I did see most of the classic Bond movies while growing up, I have little recollection of them individually. There are flashes  - Oddjob, Jaws, the Lotus, Atlantis,  ""No Mr Bond, I expect you to die"" - but I don't know how much are from remembering details from the movies and how much are from cultural osmosis over the past forty plus years.

Growing up there was always the conversation about who your favourite Bond was. I mean, not *always*. It's not like we'd have family debates around the dinner table, or hear Father Hurley regularly bang on about one over the other at Mass (ok, maybe once). But it was one of those things that cropped up every now and again - who was better, Connery or Moore? Lazenby was never in the conversation, back in the VHS days, because most people only saw Bond movies on the telly, and it was never OHMSS that was on (in fact, it's the one Bond movie I *know* I didn't see as a child).

I actually can't believe that there was ever a debate on who the best Bond is. Connery has charisma, charm, and a physicality and masculinity that makes you *believe* that all these women really were falling at his feet. He was a handsome big bastard. Moore, on the other hand, is some sort of ambulatory coffee table. The lack of chemistry in every scene between him and the female cast members is palpable, and it's not helped by that period's method of filming kissing scenes where faces are just smooshed together at strange angles, as if to hide the fact that the female actor is questioning every life choice that led her to that position. His fight scenes all look awkward and poorly staged, because he moves his limbs as if he's not had enough WD-40 sprayed on.

Not that all the Moore films are bad - just mostly. Their tone may have come across differently at the time, but, watching them now, his 70s output all has very a strong whiff of both Carry On and contemporary pornography - look at all those scenes where Moore meets a new female character, calls her ""darling"" and then proceeds to squash his mouth into her cheek, and tell me it doesn't resemble the beginning of a porn scene. The ""humour"", such as it is, tends to exist at the nudge-nudge-wink-wink level, relying on British stereotyping and innuendos, the likes of which Sid James would have been proud of. 

Those stereotypes, the casual racism and rampant misogyny and sexism are things that I have never really noticed until watching these movies again as a middle aged man. When I watched them as a boy, all I saw was a cool secret agent, cool cars and gadgets, and bad guys getting what was coming to them. Watching them now, I finally begin to understand the criticisms - and find myself agreeing. 

Moore's 80s films are better - although everyone seems to have been on a shitload of coke for A View To A Kill, and we'll skip over Octopussy - but Connery's movies stand above, except for Diamonds Are Forever, which is just as sleazy as a movie set in Las Vegas should be. It's quite clear that, by that point, Connery really didn't give a shit, and his indifference seems to permeate the entire production. Even *if* Moonraker is utter rubbish, it's *fun* rubbish. Diamonds Are Forever is a shit film, with a shit premise, and it looks like everyone in it is having a shitty time.

The forgotten man of the era is Lazenby, who turns up, is outshone by Diana Rigg, spends half the film having his voice dubbed by another actor, and then leaves. On Her Majesty's Secret Service deserved a better actor in the role, but it devolves into a sex comedy for half its runtime, and not even prime Connery could have saved that. 

Connery's best film - and therefore the best from this era of Bond, in my opinion - is From Russia With Love. It's a movie that stands out from the rest of this era of Bond because it feels like a Cold War spy film, not an action movie or a power fantasy. It's Connery's best performance until Never Say Never Again, and it's (possibly - I've still got a few movies to watch) the last movie until Craig's Casino Royale where Bond isn't invincible. He gets the *shit* kicked out of him in FRWL, and fights with a brutality (as far as 60s action movies go) that we don't see again in this era. From Goldfinger onwards, Bond is a super hero. In From Russia With Love, he's just a man.

1gsaxon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1gsaxon/help_id_prox_sensor/,Help ID prox sensor,"Hi Everyone, 

My partner runs a coffee business and I thought I'd be a hero by fixing her grinder. But, in doing so, I manhandled the lid and broke ""lid open"" safety switch. The safety seems to operate with some kind of proximity sensor. The sensor is integral to the main processor board (dumb design if you ask me). The manufacturer (Mahlkonig) sells the board but it's $500, which is steep for such a simple issue. 

I have sufficient skill and tools to replace the the components, but insufficient knowledge to identify the appropriate replacement. If there's anyone here who could point me in the right direction, I'd sure be appreciative. 

  
Here's a photo of the broken component. I figure one emits some kind of light and the other receives the reflected light signaling that the machine is ""safe."" 

https://preview.redd.it/e8senzt6p51e1.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=c442ac53cb6fb21b34a402317b429f64ebcb8006

Here's the board from the manufacturer's website with the component in question highlighted: 

https://preview.redd.it/w05w0jxdp51e1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f53ea189912d90728bef6d73fe60057abe53161

I've been unable to locate a component diagram for the board. Just for kicks, I manually shorted the leads across the sensor pins; the error momentarily clears and then returns. I suspect that the processor is expecting a certain resistance across the sensor, or perhaps a non-continuous signal generated by the emitter. I'd be willing to live without the safety functionality if I can get the error to clear. If I'm unable to identify the correct replacement components, I was thinking maybe a properly specified resistor would do the trick. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",1,1731716426.0,AskElectronics,0,1.0,False

It was part of a new perk for senior employees, a sleek, high-tech vehicle that he could use for work and personal trips. His manager, Derek, casually mentioned that it was to help him balance his busy schedule—“No more late-night commutes, just let the car handle it,” he’d said with a wink. At first, Tom was grateful. He could work late without worrying about driving home exhausted. The car would take him home, and he could finish up emails or take calls in the backseat. It seemed like the perfect setup.

But soon, things started feeling strange. The longer he worked, the more his hours seemed to stretch. Every time he looked at the clock, it was later than he thought, but Derek was always encouraging him. “You’re doing great, Tom. The car can handle the drive, so no rush. Just get those reports done.” Tom couldn’t remember a time when the company had asked so much of him—nights turned into weekends, and yet the Tesla was always there to whisk him home, its autopilot making the drive as easy as pressing a button. At first, the late-night drives felt productive. He'd eat a quick snack or drink coffee as the car drove him. But then, the car started showing up with meals—carefully packaged, pre-planned dinners waiting for him in the backseat. At first, he thought it was a thoughtful gesture from the company, but soon, it became too frequent to ignore. The meals were different every time—healthy salads, gourmet sandwiches, warm pasta dishes—always enough to keep him going for hours.

One evening, as he settled into the car, he looked at the plate of food in the passenger seat and realized he couldn't even remember the last time he had been home long enough to cook himself a meal. A cold feeling crept over him. He reached for his phone, and as if on cue, it buzzed with a new message from Derek: *“You're doing excellent work, Tom. No need to rush home. The car’s got you. Do me a favor and run back up to send out that last report when you finish eating. It shouldn't take long and if you need a break you can just nap in the car, no need to head home tonight...”*",1,1731716251.0,algoween,0,1.0,False

Two notes: *1. I know correlation is not causation, just thinking out loud. 2. I see and respect intersex, trans, non-binary people and the full spectrum of gender expression. I’m speaking specifically of cis hetero relationships.*

Divorce rates are at an all time high: due to multiple factors from no-fault divorce, women gaining more systemic independence, slow decline of organized religion, etc. 

It also seems that men and women can’t really become friends anymore unless it happened sometime in youth. You don’t hear of strong friendships or bonds between straight men and women that aren’t related or f*cking anymore. 

Relationships seem to have more and more things generally considered “cheating” or that are very upsetting when they’re really just normal social behavior. Why is it weird to have a long text volley with a peer of the opposite gender? Why is it so offensive if you want to grab coffee with a guy in a relationship when you’re in the same field, have the same hobbies, and would probably be good friends? I know people blame phones, but phones just give us evidence of what’s going on. I get that it’s hypothetically easier to cheat when you have access to everyone, everywhere, all at once, so you can find a mister or mistress outside of your social circle and your partner would never know, but I really kinda feel like people who cheat were mostly vulnerable to that anyways and don’t hold themselves to that bar regardless of the sea of fishes through the internet. 

I have this running hypothesis that the restriction on co-ed friendships is not as related to the access the internet gives us as people think. I believe it’s more connected to growing insecurity people have due to the high divorce rate. And people mess up there because restricting your partner socially isn’t going to end up helping. When you let a dog who has been tied up loose, they don’t walk away slowly. They BOLT away. And people misconstrue a statistic with no interpersonal insight as something they should apply to their marriage, which is crazy. 65% of marriages ending in divorce doesn’t mean any one marriage has a 65% chance of surviving. 

I’m just bummed because I’m 24 and I feel like people are only looking for partners now and other couples to hang with bc having single attractive friends is seen as a threat. And I don’t know how we get back to a world where I can say a guy’s band tee is dope and asking where he got it without him saying “I have a girlfriend” and her popping up behind and giving me the Medusa face.

[I have fond memories of playing Pac-Man at my local 7-11 in the 80's. Back then, nobody knew who Namco was. Pac-Man was a Midway game to all of us. Midway's team designed the iconic yellow cabinet graphics and they were very much behind its popularity with extensive marketing and merchandising. So, it seems fitting to get Midway's name back on there. This marquee replica is intended for the original Pac-Man cabaret\/mini arcade cabs from the 80's, which are the same width as this deluxe cab. I just had to cut 1\/4 inch off the top and bottom to fit.](https://preview.redd.it/fu4sr3gag51e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ab89b474ac2c50d7ab54542dfedf75ca3851ef6)

  


[Cleaned up the control deck to de-emphasize the Live, power and volume buttons\/switches. Also changed out the buttons on right to be color coded with the corresponding graphics -- not accurate to original since the original didn't have buttons beyond one or two player start buttons, but it works with the design. That's a Midway Manufacturing plate on the stock Arcade1Up coin door, again just pure nostalgia for me. I also moved it up the front panel to be positioned where you'd expect it and put lights in it. Beyond just aesthetics, actual play experience is improved with a genuine leaf switch joystick, like the original Pac-Man had. ](https://preview.redd.it/uly5tj4hg51e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94dca362bf694bd10880dfe9de260eeb0eb8717d)

Not just lonely, but truly, utterly alone. I’ve never had a friend to call my own. My father died when I was eight, leaving my mother to raise me on her own. There were no siblings, no distant cousins, no extended family dropping by to fill the empty spaces. To this day, I’m not even sure if anyone else in my family exists outside of her.

She was all I had, and she never let me forget it. ""The world is dangerous,"" she would say, her voice low and firm, as though even speaking too loudly might invite unseen threats. That was her excuse for keeping me isolated, for not allowing me to have friends. Not that it mattered—I didn’t exactly attract people anyway. At school, I was the outcast, the one everyone avoided, like they could sense something was wrong with me. Something broken.

The day after my high school graduation, cancer finally claimed her. It was slow, silent, and inevitable, like the world had decided to erase her in the same quiet way it had erased every other connection in my life. And with her gone, I was truly alone.

I tried to make a life for myself, but it was like patching together a broken mirror—every reflection of me was distorted. I hopped from one odd job to the next: baggage handler at the supermarket, flipping burgers at the diner, delivering meat for a factory. None of it stuck. None of it made me feel any less invisible. I thought maybe working around people would force me to connect, but no one even noticed me. I felt like a ghost, drifting between the living.

My last job—cleaning animal excrement—was a fitting end to that chapter of my life. It was, quite literally, a crappy job. I was fired after three months, but honestly, I didn’t care. By then, I had stopped expecting anything from life.

That’s when I saw the ad online.

I didn’t even think twice before applying. The job was to follow people. That’s it. Tail them, watch them, report back. It should’ve raised a few red flags, but at that point, I wasn’t fazed by much of anything. What should it matter? I was just a nobody anyway. 



The interview was held in an unmarked building on the outskirts of the city. Its exterior was unremarkable—gray walls, no signage, and windows tinted so dark they felt more like voids. I almost walked past it, thinking I had the wrong place, but the text on my phone confirmed the address.

Inside, the air was thick, the kind of silence that swallowed sound whole. A receptionist, who barely looked up from her desk, pointed me toward a single door at the end of a long hallway. I don’t know why, but every step I took made my stomach churn a little more.

The room I entered was small, with stark fluorescent lights that buzzed faintly overhead. A man sat behind a desk, wearing a suit that seemed one size too big for him. His face was pale, his hair slicked back, and his eyes… they didn’t blink as much as they should.

""Take a seat,"" he said, motioning to the only chair in the room.

I sat. The chair creaked beneath me, loud enough to make me flinch.

He leaned forward, his thin lips curling into a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. ""You’re here for the position?""

I nodded.

He glanced at a paper on the desk, though it seemed blank from where I was sitting. ""No experience, I see. Perfect. We don’t like people who know too much.""

I wasn’t sure how to respond, so I stayed quiet.

His gaze met mine, sharp and unwavering. ""Tell me, have you ever felt like you’re being watched?""

The question caught me off guard. ""Uh… not really.""

""Interesting,"" he murmured, scribbling something on the blank paper. ""And do you believe in coincidence?""

I hesitated. ""I… I guess?""

He tapped his pen against the desk, the rhythm irregular, almost agitating. ""You guess. Hmm. Tell me, if you had to follow someone for weeks, months even, and they started to… notice you, would that scare you?""

I blinked. ""I don’t think so?""

His smile widened, showing teeth that were just a bit too straight, too white. ""Good. Fear complicates things.""

""Is this… normal for the job?"" I finally asked, unable to keep the unease out of my voice.

""There’s nothing normal about life, wouldn’t you agree?"" He leaned back, his shadow stretching across the desk like it was alive. ""Last question. If the person you were following looked directly at you and asked, Who are you? Why are you here?—what would you say?""

I froze, the hypothetical question feeling heavier than it should. ""I… I don’t know.""

He clapped his hands together once, the sound echoing too loud in the tiny room. ""Perfect answer. You’re hired.""

""Just like that?""

""Just like that,"" he said, standing up and extending his hand. His grip was cold, like shaking hands with a mannequin. ""Welcome to Undercover Inc. Your first assignment will arrive tomorrow. Don’t worry about the details—you’ll get them when you need them. Just be ready.""

I left the building with the strangest feeling, like I’d just signed a contract without reading the fine print. And a

s I stepped back into the city’s bustling streets, I couldn’t shake the sensation that someone was already following me.

The next morning, my phone buzzed with a new email. It was from Undercover Inc.,

$22 an hour. I couldn’t help but let out a low whistle. That was more than I’d ever made at any of my previous jobs, and all I had to do was follow some guy around? Easy money, or so it seemed.

The email also included an attachment—a photo of Henry. It was a grainy image, like something taken from a security camera. He looked average: thinning hair, glasses perched on his nose, and a slight slouch to his posture. There was nothing remarkable about him, just an ordinary man in an ordinary blazer.

Still, something about the lack of information gnawed at me. Why was I supposed to follow him? Why him, out of all people? But the email had been clear—I wasn’t paid to ask questions.

I clicked on the address link, which opened a map. Henry lived in a small suburban neighborhood about 20 minutes away from me. I didn’t have a car, but the bus route was direct enough. I jotted down the directions and set a reminder for tomorrow morning.

The rest of the day felt surreal. I kept rereading the email, trying to glean some hidden meaning, but there was nothing there. The instructions were almost clinical in their simplicity.

Who was Henry L. Newman?

And why would anyone care about his ""day-to-day activities""?

I looked up the address on my laptop. 218 Waverly Drive was part of a quiet cul-de-sac, lined with trimmed hedges and identical white mailboxes. Perfectly normal.

Maybe he was under investigation? Maybe someone thought he was hiding something? But if that were the case, wouldn’t this be a police matter? My mind spun with possibilities until I finally forced myself to stop. None of it mattered. All I had to do was watch, report, and collect my paycheck.

For the first time in years, I felt a small flicker of excitement. Sure, it was a weird job, but it was something different. Something I hadn’t done before. And the money wasn’t bad, either.

Tomorrow, I’d meet Henry L. Newman—not literally, of course. Just from a distance. I’d watch his life unfold for a week and, hopefully, learn nothing more than what I needed to know.



The next morning, I was up before my alarm. A mix of nervousness and curiosity pushed me out of bed earlier than usual. After a quick breakfast, I grabbed a notebook and pen—tools I hadn’t been instructed to bring but figured might be useful—and headed for the bus stop.

The ride to Waverly Drive was uneventful, the kind of quiet suburban scenery you see in real estate brochures. By the time I got off the bus, the sun was creeping higher in the sky, casting long shadows over the pristine neighborhood.

I found 218 Waverly Drive easily enough. It was exactly as Google Maps had shown: a modest, two-story home with beige siding, a neatly trimmed lawn, and a single, leafless tree in the front yard. A black sedan was parked in the driveway. Nothing about the house stood out—no glaring oddities, no ominous vibe. It was just... normal.

I settled on a bench at the small park across the street, positioned behind a pair of large oak trees that gave me a clear view of the house while keeping me hidden.



At 8:07 a.m., the front door opened, and Henry stepped out.

He was even more unremarkable in person: a middle-aged man with an average build, wearing a beige jacket and slacks. He carried a brown leather briefcase in one hand and a travel mug in the other. He walked to the black sedan, got in, and backed out of the driveway with the precision of someone who’d done it a thousand times before.

I followed him by bus as best as I could, keeping track of his movements through the streets. He drove to a small, nondescript office building downtown and disappeared inside. I noted the time—8:37 a.m.—and decided to hang around.



For the next eight hours, Henry did exactly what you’d expect an accountant to do.

I watched from a café across the street as he sat at his desk, visible through the large office window. He worked on his computer, shuffled papers, and occasionally answered the phone. At noon, he stepped out to grab a sandwich from the deli next door, then returned to eat at his desk.

By 5:15 p.m., he left the building and drove straight home. No stops, no detours. Once inside, he pulled the curtains shut, and I lost sight of him.

I scribbled my notes into the notebook and emailed the day’s report:

Subject: Day 1 Report

Time Observed: 8:07 a.m. – 5:37 p.m.

Notes: Subject left residence at 8:07 a.m., arrived at workplace at 8:37 a.m. Routine office work observed. Lunch break at 12:15 p.m. Returned home at 5:37 p.m. No anomalies.



It felt... mundane. Almost too mundane. I’d expected something to stand out—a suspicious meeting, strange behavior, anything. But Henry’s day was painfully average.

As I lay in bed that night, my thoughts spiraled. Why did someone want me to follow Henry? What was the point? It didn’t make sense.

Still, it was just the first day. Maybe tomorrow would reveal more. Or maybe I’d find out that normalcy itself could be the most unsettling thing of all.



The week following Henry L. Newman was mind-numbingly dull—at first. Each day began the same way: he’d leave his neatly kept home on Waverly Drive at precisely 8:07 a.m., briefcase in hand, travel mug at the ready. He’d drive to his bland office downtown, where he’d sit at his desk, immersed in spreadsheets and phone calls. By noon, he’d grab a sandwich from the deli next door, eat at his desk, and continue his work until clocking out around 5:15 p.m.

The first few days felt pointless. Henry seemed utterly ordinary, almost frustratingly so. But by midweek, something shifted.

Wednesday, instead of heading straight home after work, Henry turned off the main road and parked outside a dimly lit motel on the edge of town. My heart raced as I watched him exit his car and walk briskly to Room 214. Fifteen minutes later, a woman joined him—blonde, younger, and definitely not his wife. They stayed inside for an hour before leaving separately.

Thursday was a repeat performance. The woman arrived at the motel before Henry this time, dressed in business casual but with a certain air of secrecy. I jotted down every detail, my stomach twisting as I realized what I was witnessing.

By Friday, their routine was clear: the clandestine meetings weren’t a fluke. Henry had built a double life, his mundane facade hiding something far more complicated.

Each night, I submitted my reports, carefully leaving out the affair. Something about it felt... wrong. Was this really the purpose of my job? To expose secrets that weren’t mine to uncover?

By the end of the week, I didn’t just know Henry’s patterns—I knew his lies. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me just as closely.

My next assignment was for Marcy L. Durant. The file painted her as a chameleon—a fraudster and con artist who changed identities like others changed clothes. From fake charities to elaborate romance scams, Marcy left a trail of empty bank accounts and shattered lives. The email offered little else: a photo of a smiling brunette with sharp eyes, a list of addresses that spanned three states, and a single instruction—""Track her movements. No direct contact.""

She wasn’t too much exciting, just a mere fraudster. But the more the most exciting assignment for me after three or four more assignments was the one for a guy named Ethan Cross. He was a creepy guy. This is what the email showed me.

Details:

Name: Ethan Cross

Age: 38

Occupation: Unknown

Address: (REDACTED)

Assignment Duration: 7 days

Objective: Follow and document his day-to-day activities. Report any irregular or suspicious behavior.

Compensation: $30/hour



Note: This assignment is different. Trust your instincts. Keep your distance and observe discreetly, but be cautious—something about this subject doesn’t sit right. We don’t have any concrete evidence of criminal activity yet, but we suspect there’s more than meets the eye. You’ll understand why soon enough. Do not approach or engage with the subject.



The first day I followed Ethan Cross, I felt a sense of unease, though I couldn’t pinpoint exactly why. He looked normal—almost too normal. A tall, well-dressed man with slicked-back hair and a black overcoat, like someone stepping out of an old noir film. The kind of guy who would command attention just by walking into a room. He exuded an effortless charm, greeting everyone with a smile that felt a little too practiced, a little too perfect.

Ethan's routine was oddly structured, almost mechanical. He left his house promptly at 8:00 a.m., grabbed a coffee from the same café each day, and always spoke with the barista by name, as though they were old friends. Yet, there was something off about it. His interactions were too smooth, his gestures too rehearsed. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was playing a part—a role he’d perfected over the years.

I followed him to his office building, a sleek, glass-and-steel structure downtown. He wasn’t listed as an employee there, yet he walked inside like he owned the place. I waited outside, watching as he disappeared into the lobby, not once glancing over his shoulder. Hours later, he reappeared, briefcase in hand, his demeanor unchanged, as if nothing had happened.

I continued to follow him the next few days, noting his frequent visits to a nearby hotel. Each time, he seemed to be checking into a different room, leaving after a few hours with the same calm demeanor. Who was he meeting? What was he doing there?

On the fourth day, I saw him leave the hotel with a woman—her features hidden by a dark scarf—but I caught a glimpse of her face as she entered the black sedan with him. She looked... frightened. And that’s when I started to realize that Ethan Cross wasn’t just charming—he was dangerous. The cracks in his perfect façade were starting to show, and I was beginning to wonder if I was just a witness, or if I was becoming part of something far darker.



By the fifth day, the unease in my gut had turned into something far more intense. Ethan Cross’s charm was no longer just a performance—it was a mask. A carefully constructed front that hid something far more sinister. The more I observed him, the more I noticed things that didn’t add up. Small things, like the way his reflection in the store window never seemed to match his movements exactly, or the strange way his voice would fluctuate when he spoke to certain people, as though he wasn’t entirely present.

The hotel visits were becoming more frequent. But it wasn’t just the oddity of his schedule that unsettled me—it was his demeanor. Every time he returned to his car, there would be blood on his coat sleeve, a faint smear at his collar, like he had been handling something he shouldn’t have. I wanted to believe I was imagining it, but when I started to follow him further, I couldn’t ignore the growing evidence.

On the sixth day, I followed him again, but this time, I made sure to stay farther back. He led me to an abandoned building on the edge of town—an old warehouse with rusted metal doors and boarded-up windows. I watched from across the street, too far to be seen but close enough to catch the faintest of movements. Ethan entered the building, and I waited, my mind racing with possibilities.

Two hours later, I saw him leave, but he wasn’t alone. A woman stumbled out of the building, disoriented and shaking. She was wearing the same dark scarf I’d seen before, but this time, it was covered in blood. Her eyes were wide with terror, and her clothes were torn, as though she’d fought to get away. Ethan, his usual calm demeanor unwavering, calmly walked her to his car. As he opened the door for her, I saw it. There was no fear in his eyes, just something... hollow. As if he were detached, performing a task, not as a man, but as something else entirely.

I followed him again that night. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was on the verge of uncovering something far darker than I could comprehend. As the hours passed, I kept seeing the same patterns: women, often from the same hotels, disappearing into that warehouse. But something in the back of my mind kept nagging at me. 

When I reported my findings back to my employers, Ethan Cross was gone. He seemed to have vanished into thin air, like he never existed at all. There was no trace of him, no sign that anyone had ever seen him. The warehouse was abandoned, desolate. It was as if the world had wiped him from its memory. But it wasn’t just him. Every single person I had been tasked with following—Henry Newman, the fraudster, the woman I had watched, the others—had disappeared too. Like they were nothing more than figments of my imagination, erased from existence.

I sat there, staring at the computer screen, a strange emptiness settling in the pit of my stomach. I scrolled through the reports, trying to make sense of what had happened, but there were no answers. The assignments had just… ended. No more updates, no more instructions. Like everything had been scrubbed from the records.

But it didn’t matter to me. I had done my job. I had followed the orders, observed every detail, documented the patterns. It wasn’t my responsibility to figure out the why, the how, or the what next. My employers paid me for my discretion, for my ability to follow without asking questions. They didn’t pay me to care. They paid me to work, to remain anonymous, to keep my head down and do as I was told.

And that’s what I did. No questions, no thoughts about the strange disappearances, the eerie feeling I had whenever I looked back at my notes. It was over, and I had my paycheck. That’s all that mattered. It was just another assignment, another job done.

I shut down my computer, grabbed my coat, and walked out into the night. The city felt colder than usual, but maybe that was just me. Either way, I didn’t care.

I've been doing this job for a while now, long enough that it’s become a part of me. Not just something I do to pay the bills, but something I’ve woven into the fabric of my existence. I’ve become so good at it that it no longer feels like work. It feels like living in the shadows—where no one can see me, and I can see everything. Like a ghost, I move unnoticed, slipping between people and places without leaving a trace.

I don’t even think about it anymore. I’ve mastered the art of blending in, of becoming invisible. It’s a skill, one that I’ve honed over time. The art of observation, of moving without being noticed, of being present without ever being acknowledged. People look right past me now. It’s like I’m not even there. Sometimes, they’ll glance behind them, a flicker of suspicion in their eyes, but by the time they turn around, I’ve already disappeared into the crowd, swallowed up by the dark. They never really see me. They just feel something, a fleeting sense of something there, and then it’s gone.

I’ve become a shadow, a part of the background. And in a strange way, it’s comforting. I don’t need to be seen. I don’t need to be remembered. I don’t even need to exist in any meaningful way. I’ve become a master of my own disappearance. I’m not even sure if I care about anything anymore.

This job—it’s consumed me. It’s all I have now. I follow, I observe, and then I report. I don’t ask questions. I don’t question why I’m doing it. There’s a numbness to it, an emptiness that I’ve come to accept. And the more I do it, the more I sink into it, the more I feel like I’m slipping away. Like I’m fading, becoming less and less of a person, more of a presence, a faint outline in the corners of the world that no one notices.

I’ve learned to embrace it. This life in the dark. It’s my world now, the only one I know. And as long as I keep moving through it, I’ll stay invisible. Unseen. Unnoticed. A ghost in the crowd.

I’m there, lurking just out of sight, fading into the background. But I’m always there, always close. And when you think you’re alone, remember—*I’m watching you. You’ll disappear soon enough……*

Once we are comfortable enough, we could hang-out together, curl up in a blanket and watch netflix while sipping on hot chocolate, go to the theater or do things together you might be interested in. If you like gaming, I'd be content to hang-out and watch as you play games over your console/PC.

I am looking for strictly platonic encounters, nothing more nothing less. People looking for sexual intimacy, please don't interact.

I'm 28F, medium height, hygienic and respectful.

Instead of ya know, getting a new headlight and updated registration, he just drives mine everywhere. 

He’s literally putting so many miles on it, runs down my gas tank, and also since my debit card is attached to my key chain, I’ve noticed he’s even been using MY card to buy coffee (that he tried making it seem like he was doing something nice for me for once. “Hey babe I’ll get you a coffee in the morning when I go do XYZ!”) I dont check my account religiously so after a few days when I did, I saw he was using my card. To buy my coffee, his coffee, and him food! Lmao what the hell. Like okay whatever but he’s reallllllly starting to come off as a freaking bum! 

He just left in my car of course to pick up dinner that I paid for obviously and is going to pick up his 3 kids food (it’s their weekend here) and I see he left his wallet so that only means I’m also buying their food, not him. Again I don’t care but he doesn’t even ask me! He just uses my card!

I need some help with designing a cozy dining space that feels cohesive given the mix of colors and finishes already in the room. I want this area to serve as a dining space with a table that can extend for larger gatherings (ideally seating 4+ people when needed), but I’m not sure how to tie everything together with the existing elements.

Here’s what I’m working with:
- Coffee Cart: Espresso-colored with a grey top.
- Ceiling Beams: Dark brown, likely a dark walnut finish.
- Floor: A warm honey/golden brown tone.
- Potential for Bar Seating: I’d love to incorporate bar stools at the kitchen bar to increase seating options, but I’m unsure how to balance them with the dining table and coffee cart in this relatively small space.

My Questions:
	1.	What color and style of dining table would help pull these elements together?
	2.	Any tips on integrating bar seating at the kitchen counter without crowding the room?
	3.	How can I position everything for a cohesive look that feels open and inviting?

Additional Details:
- Attached are pictures of the space, including a rough layout with measurements.
- I’m in the US, so furniture or decor suggestions available here would be ideal.
- My style leans toward cozy and clean (not eclectic or boho), so I’d love suggestions that keep the space warm and welcoming without too much visual clutter.

I've been a part of this subreddit for quite a while but mostly as a lurker/occasional commenter. I actually have something of my own to bring to the table this time! 

For the past couple of months my wife, Heather, has been teaming up with Chaotic Good on S. Broadway to host Learn-to-Plays on the 3rd Saturday of each month for a game called Dice Throne. If you're unfamiliar, Dice Throne is a battle game with MTG and Yahtzee elements. 

For a quick, simple overview [check out a short video.](https://youtu.be/js_cZrv6cZY?si=dpttd9uxsWINvCdy)

The game is a favorite of ours which is why we approached Chaotic Good about giving this a shot back in the Summer. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same built-in fan base over decades like Magic or a lot of the traditional TCGs going now. We are trying to get this off the ground before ranked play officially begins in January, which Chaotic Good has been approved to host. 

All that to say -- if you're planning on having a chill weekend but are up for doing something fun and potentially new for you, come out to Chaotic Good between noon and 2PM tomorrow, the 16th, for a quick learn-to-play and free play session. There is a Tournament afterwards from 2-4PM or 5PM (participation depending). All characters and game materials will be provided for you.

Have you ever seen an ox? They’re humongous and so friendly. They also have donkeys that are huge and soft. I didn’t know donkeys were that soft. I guess you can stay the night since they have places you can rent, and I’d definitely rent a place there if I was from out of town. Have a nice glass of wine or a cup of coffee and watch oxen plow the fields or whatever they’re doing at the time.

I’m a sophomore at an Ivy League (just for context), and am really interested in financial planning as a career. I’ve done a lot of coffee chats to talk to people who are working in the fee-only space and have an internship lined up at a fee-only RIA this summer. My school doesn’t offer a CFP-certified program, but most people I’ve talked to said I can take the CFP courses while working after graduation. 

I know prestige isn’t as important in financial planning as it is in fields like IB or PE, but I’m wondering if it’s worth transferring to my local school that has a CFP program that I'd be able to finish in two years. 

My parents are happy with me being at an Ivy League, and overall I'm happy where I'm at, so it’s a tough call. I would plan to take the series 65 before graduating if I didn't transfer to the local school. 

Would taking the courses now make a big difference, or should I handle it later?

However we only see one another of an evening and it's been approximately 21 times we've spent together. But I've always found it a bit off- like how we only get intimate in bed, even kissing. But I've put that down to it just being different then anything I've had before and so kept going. Anyway, for context he has 2 teenagers from a previous marriage. And so this one night, It was his turn to have them. As it happened, I promised my friends I'd finally go see their open mic at the pub. My friends are the guys I train with, and I've known them for well over 14 years. They are also much older but we get on. I was honest and told my bf what I was up to and he got really weird about it, which has since caused an argument/impasse. 
So, his boundary that he stands firmly on is that he doesn't want me seeing any guy/guys in the context of drinking alcohol.  Like ever. But coffee is fine. 
It's not that he doesn't trust me, he says but he doesn't trust men. 
I've offered for him to join but he's even stated that he'd still stand firm on his boundary. 

Just for some context too, I have always been a tomboy and got on better with men than women, so I have many more male friends and through the gym too. 

We had a chat about it, and he keeps brining it up every few minutes, but then also says ""it's not you, you're an adult, you can do what you like etc "" but not that. 

Then after that night at the pub, we were meant to see each other, but i was emotionally tired and just tired, with work the next morning an early start too so I told him I'd rather have some time to myself and that I'm tired. 
He told me I was taking the piss, and that I can go out the night before and see a friend for coffee the next morning but then cancel on him. 
Now he's bringing it up every minute despite trying to talk it out. 
I think this is a bad sign and I got blamed for things in my last relationship that I never did or got exaggerated, so I'm thinking I'm so done. He's clearly got past trauma but projecting it onto me in a black and white fashion. I feel like I'm being put into a box. I've tried to compromise but he won't have it. And now being blamed, and not being able to let even a small thing go, is it better to just leave?

 Should I be done?

My (21F) boyfriend (21M) and I have been dating for almosr 6 years. We have certainly had our ups and downs but I have never been this close to ending things as I am right now.

About 6 months ago, he started getting really into Dr. K's YouTube videos, particularly on the topic of Ayurveda and the benefits of meditation. I was not alarmed at first because he has a history of hyperfixating on ""self-help"" channels in the past (Andrew Huberman, Wim Hoff, etc.) so I thought it was just going to be another phase of his that I just had to wait out. He started meditating daily, which I have no problem with because I know meditation has its benefits, he started doing Surya Namaskar, and again, I thought it was just yoga so I had no issue with it at all. 

Well, the hole just has kept getting deeper and deeper. He keeps talking to me about what the Yogis have ""discovered"" and ""found"" through their time in the mountains or something and it all sounds so unbelievable to me. I don't believe in chakras or avoiding onion or garlic and all of that stuff that he is preaching to me. It feels like he really wants to almost convert me to this way of life, even though I am not a spiritual person and I find no comfort in it at all. The most recent issue is that he is practicing the Sattvic diet so he is restricting his foods more and more. We used to love making coffee and tea together (I'm a barista so it is one of my favorite hobbies) but now we can't do that anymore either. He spends hours and hours meditating each day and it impacts his ability to get ready on time and get important things done (ex., he is really unhappy at his current job but he has no time to check indeed because he just meditates for so long... meaning that he is stuck in this unhappy situation).

I'm typing this all out and realizing it may not sound as bad as it feels to me, but I really can't understand how often he brings this stuff up. For some reason I just cannot stand to be around him when he is talking about everythng he has ""learned"" through his YouTube research. I'm seeing now that he has been watching videos about semen retention and I'm like WTF?

I feel like a bad girlfriend for not being supportive of all of this but to be honest, I just don't believe in any of it and it is difficult to see him so infatuated with the idea of something that I just believe to be placebo. Of course, it also causes a rift in our relationship knowing that I don't believe in any of it. This is jumping ahead a bit, but I'm picturing him teaching our kids this and it makes me cringe. He keeps talking about how this is making his life ""better"" and he is working on himself for me, but I just don't see it because he isn't actually working towards anything that would impact our future, like getting a better job or considering going back to school.

Neither of us are Indian, btw. I'm white and atheist for my entire life (parents never forced me to practice religion so naturally I never really formed a belief in any God or Gods) and he is southeast Asian from a Christian background",3,1731713759.0,atheismindia,5,1.0,False

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",1,1731713486.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

US: Assuming clearly very safe&respectful, right age, attractive and not at night or when rushing, please tell me some advice? Moving","More than dating I find strangers never allowed to interact one of the worst parts of UK culture. Looking at icecreams in supermarket and everything sold out, make a joke to guy there with me for a solid minute, Literally pretends I don't exist and ignores. I personally think that's really unnaturally unfriendly and other brits know that's the truth; very often must be a weirdo for breaking the stranger rule. I'm very friendly and wish others were able to act normally as funny things like a lift from floor 16 to 0 stopping on 11 floors are worth a funny friendly exchange with your trapped neighbour. Some do, but many truly act like nobody said anything as in Britain you culturally aren't friendly to strangers. 

Any fellow brits please know quoting london experience and brit from birth to 29; even if prompted to disagree you know British rules include in general do not chat with strangers and while only some are this weird, it is unnatural and unfriendly.


My understanding is the US is generally more relaxed about such situations and just being friendly. Massive extension is approaching girls: truly not a done thing here.

Can be done awfully (gym badly, nighttime, touching, ridiculous age gap) but let's ignore those and assume a brit isn't going to suddenly ignore their upbringing 🤣 whether i am or not please also assume right Age, attractive and not gonna be danger vibes, more likely is unknowingly breaking a rule like rushing with headphones in (annoying 😉). Just so focus isnt on wrong things more when in US is it best received (especially gym as know this is the danger area 😅😅).

Sometimes however repeatedly seeing same girl over months at gym, hearing how they chat to gym friends they bring without eavesdropping lol, I'll want to genuinely ask them out because shared hobby + sound kind. No experience as a brit, please treat me as child explaining when and how could approach 🤣


Similarly in coffee shop if girl reading a favorite book of mine and find her attractive, why wouldn't I want a chat+see if single and feeling is mutual lol.

Just not done here.

Not scared of it at all. Terrified of being scary or a creep. Hence advice as if I'm a child on where, when, how and also if it's hugely variable up to British NO by state?

Sorry for essay hope makes sense. Bored of apps would love Literally most natural option in world where shared interests are catalysts. 

Just like on apps, find someone super hot on besch not worthwhile; odds of clicking worse than shared interests etc.

We went to grab a coffee, I was in a bit of a pissy, mood (PMS, lol) and everything was okay until the way back. He wanted to drop off coffee to his mom and I had to pick up my little sister from school, which I would have been late to if we went to drop off coffee first. I told him to take me home because I can't have her standing outside waiting for 30 minutes. He has younger sisters too, so i'm sure he understands. We were heading back to my house and I cracked a joke. He was all of a sudden mad and said stop talking to me. This was so out of the blue and I wasn't sure if I said or did something to upset him. I tried asking a few times and he continued saying ""stay confused"" or ""stop talking"" and not answering the question. I stayed quiet the rest of the car ride and got out of the car without saying anything. I'm not planning on calling or texting him because I still don't understand what's wrong and he clearly doesn't want to talk about it. If he tries to text me I won't respond since he told me to stop talking. I know he has a lot of stress with work and he sometimes does things to annoy me but I don't argue just for the sake of avoiding arguments and I don't want to stress him out more. I don't know if he's upset that I need to pick up my sister? Or something else?
Doesn't make any sense.
Does anyone have any advice? With little arguments like this I usually give the petty cold shoulder and silent treatment until I realize I don't have the energy to argue and I just stop caring when he tries to hug me or act normal.",1,1731713226.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I wanted to share some of my own experience with breaking no contact and dealing with heartbreak in general. I was madly in love with my ex and felt like my world was torn to pieces when he left me. 
He wanted to still be in contact right after but I held back. After a couple of months I was still heartbroken and thought about contacting him every day. At last I gave in to the temptation and texted him. We talked on the phone for about five hours, and he asked if he could call me another day, and suggested that we’d meet up for coffee. I responded that I would be open for that, yet I didn’t hear anything from him the next two weeks. His birthday was coming up, and I (stupidly enough) texted him happy birthday. No response at all, not even a thank you. I felt the rejection all over again, and felt so stupid for letting him mess with my head like that. A week later a friend of mine saw him on tinder, and once again I was shattered. Not because I wished for a second chance, but because that meant he had completly moved on from me and was ready to start over with someone else, while I was not even close to being ready for that.
A little more time has gone by, and I still haven’t heard anything from him, so I assume he changed his mind and wants to be no contact. 
The lesson I have learned from all this is that you can only find closure in yourself, not the other person. Healing is a process, and you can experience both progression and regression. I felt horrible for a very long time, but now I feel a lot better. Maybe his cold shoulder kind of forced me to just accept that he would be out of my life forever. 
Get yourself to a place in life where you are happy without the other person, and remember that you will not feel this way forever.
I still worry that I will have a hard time with love later in life because of what he put me trough. I worry that the intense ups and downs we had together has created a sort of traumabond for me. Im not a point where I see myself falling in love with anyone else for a while, but maybe it will happen when I expect it the least.

I'm happily married and want to start a family with my loving and caring wife of 7 years, except...I was fired 3 months ago for the 4th time since I started my professional career in higher education at 25, and unfortunately am not in a good enough financial position to have and take care of children. My wife has been going to college for a BS in Computer Science, and has 3 more semesters to finish. I have stayed in higher education for the tuition benefit, and while I was at one job, I got my MA in higher ed administration. 

Although rn I am a security guard at a university now (again for the tuition benefit), I've realized that I am not good at admin jobs and am looking to get out of my field. Lately, I've been strongly considering nursing since its a job that is helping people, pays a middle class income, and is a common job that ChatGPT suggests for people with ADHD. However, I'm not sure if this is the right field, so I have devised a plan.

Because I don't seem to know myself and what my calling is, I decided to reach out to my former bosses for short coffee meetings to determine what my strengths and weaknesses are, write them down and compare, and then have a conversation with a charge nurse or nurse manager to see what strengths/attributes they believe are needed to be an effective nurse, what characteristics aren't great, but aren't dealbreakers, and what characteristics are detrimental to being an effective nurse. 

If anybody has been in a similar situation and/or has any suggestions for me to find my calling, please comment because I can't seem to trust myself anymore and my wife deserves so much better than this.

It all started during a co-worker's wedding. I (37F) went there with all of our team from work. One of the analysts (30M) is such a fun guy to be around, and yeah, he's quite handsome.
That night we knew from another co-worker that he had broken up with his girlfriend around a month ago, and that was why he went alone to the wedding.

Well, after a couple of drinks, we were dancing and when you know, you knoooowww 🎶. He started looking at me and dancing with me with a flirty energy. And just at that moment I was like: ""Huh? I've never really noticed him before"". 
When we left the party, he took my hand and after we all arrived to our respective homes, he texted me saying how beautiful I looked that night. I just said thanks, and that was the end of it. I wasn't going to have any other type of relationship with a co-worker, right?! RIGHT?!

Around two months later we attended our company's party. Absolutely nothing happened during that party, we were all dancing with different people and enjoying ourselves. 
When we left, we took a cab together as we live one block away from each other (how convenient!), he took my hand in the car. I couldn't resist, I don't know if I drank too much or what, but yeah, we did it. He went to my flat and it was aMAAAaaZiinnNnnng. What can I say.

After this episode, we've seen each other quite often. I can tell he just wants sex and nothing else, and of course I was thinking the same. Did I say I WAS THINKING THE SAME? In the paaaassstttt? Yes, m'am. I knew what this could lead to, and I didn't stop myself!! 

I'm curious about your opinion on this. Could this be I'm just confusing EXCELENT TOP NOTCH sex with other feelings?
I've never felt this before, I even thought I was going frigid at some point in my life, but it seemed I was meant to have a good sex partner for once!! Like what's this man doing.

He's the type of man (and he told me this the second time we met up) that doesn't really like to cuddle a lot, and that's been an issue in his past relationships. At that time I was like, whatever, I just want you to penetrate meeee. But now? NOW? I find myself craving for him to touch me in a more romantic (?) way. Hold my hand or touch my hair after we've done it, hold me with his huge armsss. I've found myself staring at him and loving the way his lips look, his ears, his beard, his eyes, his hands, his forehead. Like wtf?! What did I do, my friendsss?!

I look at him at work and it's like I get all turned on due to the most stupid reasons! He's explaining something? Hot. He's typing an email? Hot. He goes for a cup of coffee? Hot. He winks at me at the most random moment? FUCKING HOT.

Now, he's also told me some cute things while we're in bed: you're so cute, I feel so comfortable when I'm with you, blablabla. But, of course I like that! Who wouldn't.

Did I see this coming? Yes and no. I was sure I was an independent woman with no more feelings of this type, but at the same time I was brushing off the ""what if"" thoughts.

Do I want this feelings to stop? I do. Would I like him to look at me as something more than just ""the co-worker I fuck every three days""? Also, yes, ngl. But in this case I'm guessing the first option is the safest one; I can't even think of how to make him fall in love with me, and do I really want that? I wish we could have a magic tool to know what to do with this life!

WELP,  thanks if you read this far. I appreciate any advice on how to stop feeling this way, and I know I should stop seeing him outside the office as a first step. Don't think I'm suffering or anything, I see this just as a fun and strange episode in my life. I also wanted to vent a little and tell this story here, because I can't tell anyone elseeee!! Cheers!

1gs9ckr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1gs9ckr/where_to_stay_on_the_big_island_hawaii/,Where To Stay On The Big Island Hawaii?,"Hey fellow travelers! I recently got back from an amazing trip to the Big Island of Hawaii, and I wanted to share my experience and recommendations on where to stay. After spending three weeks exploring different areas, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on the best spots.

First off, the Big Island is HUGE. It's actually twice the size of all other Hawaiian islands combined, so choosing the right area to stay is crucial. Let me break it down for you:

Kona Side (West Coast):
This is where I started my journey, and it's perfect if you're looking for that classic Hawaiian vacation vibe. The weather is usually sunny and dry, making it ideal for beach activities. I found some awesome snorkeling spots here, and the sunsets are unreal. The main town, Kailua-Kona, has tons of restaurants, shops, and nightlife options.

If you're into coffee, you've got to visit the coffee farms in this region. While you're there, check out some amazing tours and activities. I booked through this site: https://athometouch.com/hawaii and saved quite a bit with their rewards program.

Hilo Side (East Coast):
This area is completely different - it's lush, tropical, and gets more rain. But don't let that scare you! The waterfalls here are spectacular, and the botanical gardens are mind-blowing. Hilo town has this cool, laid-back local vibe that I absolutely loved. It's also closer to Volcanoes National Park, which is a must-visit.

Waikoloa/Kohala Coast:
This is where you'll find most of the luxury resorts. The beaches here are gorgeous, and the water is usually calm and perfect for swimming. It's more expensive, but the amenities are top-notch. Great for families or if you want that resort experience.

Volcano Village:
If you're into nature and want something unique, stay here. It's cooler because of the elevation, and you're right next to the national park. Perfect for hikers and nature enthusiasts.

Puna District:
This is off the beaten path, but it's where I found some of the most authentic Hawaiian experiences. Think black sand beaches, hot ponds, and amazing local markets.

Pro Tips:
- Split your stay between different areas if you can
- Rent a car (it's absolutely necessary)
- Book activities in advance (seriously, use https://athometouch.com/hawaii - they have great deals and you earn rewards)
- Check the weather patterns for different areas
- Consider vacation rentals for more space and better value

Final Thoughts:
Personally, I loved staying in Kona for the first part of my trip (great for activities and beach time) and then moving to Volcano Village (perfect for exploring the national park). The contrast between these areas really gives you a full Big Island experience.

Each area has its own charm, and honestly, there's no wrong choice - it just depends on what kind of vacation you're looking for. Whether you want resort luxury, adventure, or local culture, the Big Island has got you covered.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm happy to share more specific recommendations about any of these areas.",1,1731711855.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

She's been doing pretty good for awhile but in the past few weeks shes gone back to going in her kennel often. I kennel her while I am work as well as overnight because she tends to chew stuff. We had originally gotten her a 30x19x21 when she was small and then when she got bigger we got a 48x30x33 as we wanted her to be comfortable. She eats all her food in there even when she is running free and doesn't hate going there at all. She knows the go home command pretty well and isn't put in there as punishment for anything. The issue is mainly recently she started urinating and pooping when at first when we would leave, not even for a long time but like say, get food or coffee. I am having trouble breaking the habit. She gets plenty of praise when she goes out side and treats as well. I fear her kennel may be to big for her. We got her a bed hoping that would help but that hasn't changed anything at all.

Day 1 was a bit of a blur after the surgery.  I slept a good deal and was strangely hungry.  Ate some chicken and fruit.  Been sipping on ginger ale and water. 

Getting up sucked.  My naval incision felt like it was splitting.  I had to take some perc to help the pain and getting up was key to help get rid of gas in my abdominal area

Day 2.  A bit better.  Still sore but the naval wound felt a tad better.  No appetite this day and I took another perc to assist.  I ended up having some turkey breast for dinner and a small thing of ice cream (like 3oz) just because I wanted something sweet.  

Day 3.  Much better today.  I went downstairs and made coffee.  Walked outside for a bit.  Even went and made myself a protien smoothie. 

Other things to note.  Going the bathroom was tough day 1.  Basically unable to do anything but let gravity do it's thing when I urinated.  By Day 3, it's almost normal.  

My incisions are stiff pretty gross looking.  They used a type of glue to seal them off that is supposed to go away with time.  Naval wound looks like a baboons butt.  A little bit of pain in my right side still but different than the pain I had before. 

Got my medical report.  I had 5 polyps. 2 stones (half inch in size) and the gallbladder was filled with thick green sludge.  No cancer tho.  

Tomorrow I'm going to have my wife go for a walk with me outside (maybe half a block) and then going to sit outside and enjoy this last nice bit of fall while it's here.

# Unexpected Inspiration

What if I told you that a simple, everyday task sparked a radical shift in how I approached marketing and business? It wasn’t in a high-stakes boardroom or during some life-altering seminar. I was actually folding laundry—yes, folding laundry—when it hit me. My mind was wandering, and I found myself reflecting on a conversation I’d had with a marketing mogul I’d met at a networking event the week before. That one conversation completely flipped my thinking. He wasn’t your typical “corporate suit” guy. In fact, he was laid-back, dressed casually, and had this almost rebellious attitude toward business success. That conversation lit a fire under me. He challenged everything I thought I knew about marketing and success.

Right there, mid-laundry fold, I realized that the way I had been thinking about marketing was all wrong. I was playing small. I was stuck in a scarcity mindset, thinking in terms of limitations and obstacles. But this guy—this multi-millionaire marketer—he thought differently. He didn’t see obstacles; he saw opportunities. And that shift in thinking? That’s what separated the millionaires from the rest of us.

But I’m not here to preach. I’m here to share what I’ve learned, not just from that one conversation but from years of trial, error, and self-discovery. This is about adopting the mindset of a multi-millionaire marketer—not just the strategies, but the way they **think.**

# Encountering a Multi-Millionaire Marketer: The Unconventional Views on Success

Let me paint the picture. I was at this small, casual networking event. I wasn’t expecting much—just the usual handshakes and business card exchanges. But then I met *him*, a marketer who had built a multi-million-dollar empire. What stood out wasn’t his success—it was his attitude. He was relaxed, almost nonchalant about his achievements. I remember asking him, “What’s the secret to your success?”

His answer? “There’s no secret.”

No secret? Really? I expected a formula, a hack, something. But he went on: “I just think differently. I don’t get stuck on problems. I get stuck on solutions. Everyone else is looking at obstacles, and I’m over here thinking, ‘How can I make this work for me?’”

That was it. A simple shift in perspective.

I realized right then that if I wanted to level up, I needed to stop focusing on what was holding me back and start thinking about what could push me forward.

# The Mindset Shift

# Personal Story of Overcoming Self-Doubt: Recognizing Limiting Beliefs

So, let me get real for a moment. I’ve dealt with my fair share of self-doubt. I’ve questioned whether I had what it takes to succeed in marketing. Was I smart enough? Creative enough? Did I know enough? These thoughts weighed me down, and they were constant barriers in my career. And I know I’m not alone in this.

But here’s the thing I learned from that multi-millionaire marketer: **Limiting beliefs are a trap.** They keep your mind small, and a small mind can’t build big dreams. I realized that I had been telling myself a story—a story where I wasn’t good enough, where the competition was too fierce, where success was reserved for “other people.” That was my first mistake.

The moment I started questioning those limiting beliefs was the moment things began to change. I stopped seeing marketing as a game of “who’s better” and started seeing it as “how can I make this work for me?” And believe me, that change in mindset was **everything.**

# Embracing Abundance: How Changing My Perspective on Money Transformed My Approach

Here’s the kicker. I used to think that success in marketing was all about hustling hard and squeezing every penny out of every opportunity. I was in the scarcity mindset—thinking that money was finite and that I had to fight for every dollar. But here’s what I learned: **Money is a tool, not a goal.**

When I began to see money as something that flows, my attitude changed. Instead of focusing on making a quick buck, I started focusing on creating long-lasting value. I started thinking bigger, thinking in terms of abundance rather than scarcity. And that shift in mindset transformed my approach to everything—from how I built campaigns to how I handled clients.

# Curiosity as a Catalyst

# Anecdote About a Pivotal Conversation That Ignited My Passion for Learning

Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it made me a better marketer. I remember one particular conversation that stands out. I was talking with a fellow marketer at a conference, and he casually mentioned something about customer psychology that I had never considered before. It wasn’t just about demographics or interests—it was about understanding *why* people think the way they do.

That conversation opened a door in my mind. Suddenly, I was obsessed with learning everything I could about human behavior. Why do people buy? Why do they click? What emotions drive their decisions? This relentless curiosity became my secret weapon.

# The Habit of Asking “Why?”: How Relentless Curiosity Led to Deeper Insights

And here’s the thing: **Curiosity is the fuel for innovation.** Every time I asked “why?”, I uncovered something new. Instead of taking things at face value, I started digging deeper. Why did that campaign fail? Why did this one succeed? Why do people engage with one brand but not another?

This constant questioning led me to insights that others missed. It helped me anticipate trends, understand customer pain points, and create campaigns that resonated on a deeper level. And in a world where everyone’s trying to copy the latest trend, being curious gave me a unique edge.

# Embracing Failure

# A Personal Failure That Taught Me Resilience: Lessons Learned from a Failed Campaign

Let’s talk about failure because, honestly, we don’t talk about it enough. One of my biggest marketing failures happened early in my career. I poured my heart and soul into a campaign that I was sure would be a hit. I had the data, I had the creative, and I had the strategy. But when we launched? Crickets. The campaign tanked, and I was devastated.

But here’s the thing: **That failure was one of the best things that ever happened to me.** Why? Because it taught me resilience. I learned that failure isn’t the end of the road—it’s a detour. It forced me to look back, reassess, and figure out what went wrong. And guess what? I came back stronger, with better campaigns and a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t.

# Stories of Famous Marketers Who Turned Setbacks into Stepping Stones

I’m not the only one who’s faced failure. Some of the most successful marketers in the world have had their campaigns flop. Take Steve Jobs, for example. Before Apple became the tech giant it is today, Jobs faced rejection and failure time and time again. But he didn’t let it stop him. Instead, he used those failures as stepping stones to bigger, better things.

The lesson here? **Failure isn’t the opposite of success; it’s part of the journey.** Every failure brings you one step closer to success—if you’re willing to learn from it.

# Visualizing Success

# The Power of Visualization: How I Began to Map Out My Goals

Let’s talk about visualization—because if you can’t see it, you can’t achieve it. I’m not talking about some woo-woo concept here. I’m talking about the practical act of **mapping out your goals** and seeing them in your mind’s eye. When I started doing this, everything changed.

I began by writing down my goals—both short-term and long-term. Then, I started visualizing what success would look like. What would it feel like to hit that revenue target? What would my business look like if I landed that dream client? This wasn’t some vague daydreaming. I was specific. I mapped it out. And that act of visualizing success made it feel real and achievable.

# An Experience That Solidified the Importance of Envisioning Outcomes

There was one particular moment when this all clicked for me. I was working on a campaign for a client, and things weren’t going well. I was stressed and felt like the whole thing was going to crash and burn. But instead of giving in to the stress, I took a step back. I closed my eyes and visualized the campaign’s success. I imagined the client being thrilled with the results, the metrics soaring, and the positive feedback rolling in.

It sounds simple, but it worked. That visualization helped me refocus and approach the campaign with renewed energy. And guess what? The campaign ended up being a huge success.

# Networking Beyond Comfort Zones

# A Chance Meeting at an Event That Reshaped My Understanding of Connections

Here’s the truth: **You’re only as good as the people you surround yourself with.** Early in my career, I was shy about networking. I would stick to familiar faces and avoid stepping out of my comfort zone. But that all changed at one networking event. I met someone who completely changed my perspective on connections and collaboration. He wasn’t someone I would normally approach—he was in a different industry, with a completely different skill set. But we struck up a conversation, and it turned into a partnership that brought in more revenue than I ever imagined.

# Stories of Unexpected Partnerships and Collaborations

The magic of networking is that you never know who you’re going to meet. Some of the best collaborations I’ve had came from the most unexpected places. One time, I teamed up with a graphic designer I met at a coffee shop. Another time, a casual conversation at a friend’s barbecue led to a major business partnership. The point is, you never know where your next opportunity will come from. So don’t just network—**network outside your comfort zone.**

# Leveraging Data with Intuition

# A Pivotal Moment When Data Contradicted My Gut Feeling, and I Learned to Balance Both

Let’s get one thing straight: Data is important. But so is intuition. There was one campaign where the data was telling me one thing, but my gut was telling me another. The numbers said the audience wasn’t engaging, but I had this gut feeling that we were just one tweak away from a breakthrough. I decided to trust my instincts and made a few adjustments.

And guess what? It worked. The campaign took off, and the results were through the roof. That moment taught me that while data is crucial, **never underestimate the power of intuition.** The key is to balance both—use the data to inform your decisions, but don’t ignore your gut.

# How I Began to Trust My Instincts While Respecting Analytics

Over time, I’ve learned to trust my instincts more and more. But that doesn’t mean I ignore the data. The sweet spot is finding a balance between the two. I’ve had moments when the data was screaming “No!” but my gut said “Yes!”—and vice versa. The trick is to know when to listen to the numbers and when to trust your instincts. It’s an art, not a science.

# Innovative Thinking

# A Brainstorming Session That Led to a Breakthrough Campaign Idea

Innovation doesn’t happen by accident. It happens when you’re willing to think outside the box. I remember one brainstorming session where we were stuck. The team couldn’t come up with anything fresh. So, I threw out a wild idea—a concept that was completely different from anything we’d done before. At first, everyone was skeptical. But as we talked it through, the idea started to take shape.

That wild idea turned into one of the most successful campaigns we’d ever run. The lesson? **Don’t be afraid to think differently.** Sometimes, the craziest ideas lead to the biggest breakthroughs.

# Embracing Out-of-the-Box Thinking: A Personal Story of an Unconventional Approach

I’ve always been a fan of unconventional thinking. When everyone else is zigging, I like to zag. One time, I was working on a product launch, and the typical approach wasn’t working. So, I decided to flip the script. Instead of focusing on the product’s features, I focused on the *story* behind it. It was risky, but it paid off. The campaign resonated with the audience on a deeper level, and the product flew off the shelves.

# The Importance of Mentorship

# A Mentor’s Advice That Drastically Changed My Trajectory

I wouldn’t be where I am today without mentors. Early in my career, I had a mentor who gave me a piece of advice that changed everything: “**Don’t just work hard, work smart.**” It sounds simple, but it was a game-changer for me. Up until that point, I had been grinding away, thinking that the harder I worked, the more successful I’d be. But my mentor taught me that it’s not just about working hard—it’s about working on the right things.

# Experiences of Shadowing Successful Marketers and Absorbing Their Strategies

One of the best ways to learn is by watching successful people in action. I’ve spent countless hours shadowing successful marketers, absorbing their strategies, and learning from their mistakes. It’s one thing to read about marketing tactics; it’s another to see them in action. And the biggest takeaway? **Success leaves clues.** If you pay attention, you can learn a lot from those who’ve already walked the path.

# Cultivating a Growth Mindset

# A Challenging Project That Forced Me to Embrace Continuous Learning

Growth doesn’t happen in your comfort zone. One of the most challenging projects I ever worked on forced me to step outside of mine. It was a complex campaign with a lot of moving parts, and I had no idea where to start. But instead of shying away, I dove in headfirst. I learned new skills, tested new strategies, and pushed myself harder than ever before.

That project taught me the importance of a **growth mindset**. It’s not about being the best—it’s about being willing to learn and grow. Every challenge is an opportunity to get better.

# How a Growth Mindset Reshaped My Daily Practices and Long-Term Goals

Since then, I’ve embraced the growth mindset in everything I do. I’m constantly learning, constantly improving, and constantly pushing myself to be better. This mindset has reshaped not just how I approach marketing, but how I approach life. I set bigger goals, take more risks, and I’m not afraid to fail—because I know that every failure is just another chance to grow.

# Authenticity in Branding

# Personal Experiences with Authenticity: The Impact of Being True to My Values

Let’s get real: **Authenticity matters.** In a world where everyone’s trying to sell something, being authentic is what sets you apart. I learned this the hard way. Early in my career, I tried to be everything to everyone. I wasn’t true to my values, and it showed. My marketing felt hollow, and my audience could sense it.

But when I started being authentic—when I started marketing from a place of honesty and integrity—everything changed. I connected with my audience on a deeper level. They trusted me more. And that trust translated into loyalty, engagement, and ultimately, sales.

# Lessons Learned from Brands That Resonate Deeply with Their Audiences

The most successful brands in the world are the ones that are authentic. Think about it. Why do people love brands like Apple, Nike, or Patagonia? It’s not just because they make great products. It’s because they stand for something. They’re authentic. They know who they are, and they communicate that clearly to their audience.

The lesson here? **Be yourself.** Don’t try to be what you think people want. Be authentic, and the right people will resonate with you.

# Conclusion: The Ongoing Journey

Here’s the truth: **Thinking like a multi-millionaire marketer is a journey, not a destination.** It’s about constantly evolving, constantly learning, and constantly pushing yourself to think bigger. The lessons I’ve shared with you aren’t just strategies—they’re mindset shifts. And those shifts are what will take you from where you are now to where you want to be.

So, if there’s one thing I want you to take away from this, it’s this: **Keep going. Keep learning. Keep growing.** The journey never ends, but that’s what makes it so exciting.

1gs938u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1gs938u/need_help_to_write_a_query_reformat_results_so/,Need help to write a query re-format results so one column becomes row headers with distinct results,"Hi,

Newbie to MySQL8. In my exercise I have three tables. Table one with unique foods (sort of branded names), table two with nutrients and table three  is a junction table to join both with amounts of nutrients for each food. I need help to write two takes on (pivot?) queries to convert:

1. Column with food\_name into a table headers row. Another column with nutrients to be a right side column.
2. Column with nutrients into a table headers row and the column with food\_name to be on the right side.

Values with amounts are either displayed for each combination of food\_name/nutrient\_name or display dash ""-"" if it is missing. The number of foods in the table is dynamic but to display it on a screen I want to limit to 15. So, having 150 food items in food table would have to create 10 tables as on the sample below.

Table DDL below:

    -- create tables
    CREATE TABLE food (
     food_id int,
     food_name text  
    );
    CREATE TABLE nutrient (
     nutrient_id int,
     nutrient_name text
    );
    CREATE TABLE food_nutrient (
     food_id int,
     nutrient_id int,
     amount double
    );
    -- populate tables
    insert into food(food_id, food_name)
    values
      (1, 'cookies'),
      (2, 'coffee'),
      (3, 'tea');
    
    insert into nutrient(nutrient_id, nutrient_name)
    values
     (10, 'vitamin b'),
     (11, 'vitamin c'),
     (12, 'water'),
     (15, 'sugar');
     (22, 'fatty acid'),
     (33, 'sodium');        
    
     insert into food_nutrient(food_id, nutrient_id, amount)
     values
      (1, 11, 1),
      (1, 12, 2),   
      (1, 33, 3),   
      (2, 12, 10),
      (2, 33, 2),
      (3, 12, 15),
      (3, 15, 8);
    
      select food_name as 'Food Name', nutrient_name as 'Nutrient', amount as 'Amount'
       from food f
       join food_nutrient fn on fn.food_id = f.food_id
       join nutrient n on n.nutrient_id = fn.nutrient_id

**The result of the query below**

    Food Name   |   Nutrient    |   Amount
    ---------------------------------------
    cookies     |   vitamin c   |   1
    cookies     |   water       |   2
    cookies     |   sodium      |   3
    coffee      |   water       |   10
    coffee      |   sodium      |   2
    tea         |   water       |   15
    tea         |   sugar       |   8

**First take should look like below**

    Nutrient    |   cookies     |   coffee      |   tea
    ----------------------------------------------------
    vitamin c   |   1           |   -           |   -
    vitamin b   |   -           |   -           |   -
    fatty acid  |   -           |   -           |   -
    sodium      |   3           |   2           |   -
    water       |   2           |   10          |   15
    sugar       |   -           |   -           |   8

**Second take should look like this one below**

    Food Name | vitamin c | vitamin b | fatty acid | sodium | water | sugar
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    cookes    |   1       |   -       |   -        |   3    |   2   |  -
    coffee    |   -       |   -       |   -        |   2    |   10  |  -

The Buzz on the Spin

  
  


  
  


Everything started to happen all at once. The only warning was a flicker in the portals as something else began homing in on their signals. Then massive armoured forms appear.

  
  


The forces from Octarin Spin that had already come through the portals react instantly. 652-3-5000’s eyes widen as a Cannidor in red and blue power armour smashes into the dark grey and green of the mercenary. Shoulder mounted plasma ignites and starts to power up.

  
  


“No!” He shouts as he KNOWS that kind of heat this close will flash cook several brothers.

  
  


A line of red traces through the air, growing wider as it moves. A beam of cutting light in the hands of Hoagie, moving too fast to be properly registered as the plasma weapons are sheered through and an angry glowing line is left on the armour. 652-3-5000 then flinches back as a Gathara sized rifle clatters against his chest and he fumbles for it. It’s a laser. Precise and powerful.

  
  


Hoagie can’t be tracked normally, just followed with the wide trail of light he leaves behind as he zips from mercenary to mercenary, sheering down and cutting plasma weapons wherever he finds them. Prioritizing the as yet unmade cycle beyond anything else. Beyond everything else.

  
  


“You are not...” A newly arrived Mercenary says and he swings the rifle at her in reflex. The weapon shatters like glass against it and he backs away a step. The armoured figure grabs at the overalls he’s wearing before a beam of light extends from the side of it’s head to illuminate his bones and feathers. Just in time for his left claw to scrape against it. “You cannot win.”

  
  


The trail of light returns and stops against the head of the meachanized armour and slowly starts to sink in in Hoagie’s grip.

  
  


“You may be thermally shielded, but this is designed for starship hulls.” Hoagie says as the outer layer of the armour begins to fail and he the hull cutter starts to sink in. “Ten seconds tops.”

  
  


He carves through the head entirely and there‘s a scream as the back of the armour cracks open and a mass moves out in a single movement before recombining into a female figure as the Slohb pilot of the mechanized armour reforms and then lashes out fast. Hoagie has already moved and gotten the hull cutter between them.

  
  


The fist of the slohb splits before it can impact the hull cutter and slams into Hoagie in two locations to send him skidding back, deactivating his weapon so that it doesn’t flail out and damage a pod.

  
  


The Slohb says nothing as she shifts around the pods too fast to easily track. 652-3-5000 watches in horror as he realizes the issue. His unformed brothers are hostages to the last. They need to be moved out. Now.

  
  


He reaches the nearest pod and starts disengaging it from the hull before hefting it, it weights ten times what he does, but the power he calls to his muscles makes the burden bearable.. “Brothers! Bring the younger to safety! We cannot fight with them held hostage!”

  
  


There is movement as the living slime comes for him, but with her movement predictable Hoagie grasps it and sends a brutal charge of electricity through her body. She screams and goes limp. Unconscious or perhaps even dead. Hoagie pulls his hand out of the gel and flicks off the remains. He nods to 652-3-5000 and then reactivates his hull cutter before blurring away. He reappears stabbing it into the chest of another suit of mechanized armour and lifting it off the ground with it as the pilot tries hard to escape before the hull cutter pierces through them.

  
  


A Tret hits the floor bottom first before gathering herself and pulling out a coil pistol. The shot takes Hoagie in the gut and he slams down the armour on her in reflex. He staggers back while holding his stomach. His armour had saved his life, but it hadn’t been enough to fully stop the bullet at at most two meters range. It had mostly stopped it, but he still had a small chunk of metal embedded in his gut.

“That was a terrifying moment.” Janet says.

  
  


“Is that what made the day unusual?” Observer Wu asks.

  
  


“One of the things. While my Daniel gets into a great deal of action, he rarely gets hurt. He moves too quickly and generally his armour stops everything. And that’s if his reputation or the swarm of Beezerkers with him don’t get people to back down immediately.”

  
  


“And where were they at the time?”

  
  


“Just showing up actually...” Sarkonic says with a grin that can only be seen by a slight bunching of the paint on the left side of his face.

There is a massive swell of buzzing and a scream of fury as numerous Charbis fly in. A few dozen surround Hoagie as he tries to assure them that he’s fine, the armour took it and it’s just a bit of blood. But it’s in vain as they sweep him out in a massive group and the remainder start divebombing the incoming mercenaries with stabbing knives, cutting torches and chains to lock them up and down.

  
  


At this point numerous mercenaries are on the retreat and warping out. But those that do so coveredi n angry bee women... bring them with them.

“At this point I have to confess, I don’t have much information beyond the fact that the mercenaries who were recalled to their ships ended up just making the problems much, much worse, because the Charbis could then start openly using their weapons without risking any hostages. Two gunships went down in the end, but from my understanding the girls used little beacons on themselves to swarm the things. All but those that were getting Hoagie to a medical bay were rushing the mercenaries and the sheer weight of fire they brought to bear swarmed over them all.”

  
  


“What happened to the ships?”

  
  


“Torn apart for parts. Of course hearing how the gunships were being counter boarded galvanized the mercenaries and of course the news that they were using the unborn men provoked the rest of the station. They were already almost entirely on our side due to the fact that me and my brothers had won our freedom with blood and death, all peoples respect something in some way. And in places like this, the will to be free is respected.”

  
  


“So that led to...?”

  
  


“Octarin Spin fully mobilizing. Every single sector showing exactly WHY they are not to be toyed with. The central Battleship was under massive bombardment in moments. The remaining eight Gunships were quickly boarded as their logistics ship had the greediest women from Sector Five rushing in to loot everything that isn’t bolted down, rip out everything that is bolted down and then take the bolts for good measure too.”

  
  


“Of course.” Observer Wu says with a slight grin despite himself.

“Bring them to shelter sisters! Less they never have the chance to bless our beloved galaxy with life anew!” A small crusade of the Gravid Faith was marching through the cargo vessels and setting up interlocking shield walls and protecting the engineering crew as they removed the pods. Commodore Snarlmane had tried contacting the station again, but a chitin covered black hand had reached down from above and pulled her bodily away.

  
  


Two gunships had gone silent, a third was reduced to slag under massive bombardment and a third and fourth were shorting out.

  
  


The remaining three vessels were on full retreat, but the Gathara ships were in pursuit and laying in a massive bombardment of lasers, plasma and the occasional railshot to follow them to the Axiom Lane. They get winged and damaged, but are allowed to leave as a warning to anyone else that thinks a stunt like this is wise around Octarin Spin.

“Remarkable. So what happened to those taken prisoner?”

  
  


“There weren’t that many. Mercenaries rarely surrender or are given the chance to. These were no exception.” Sarkonic says. “One could argue the adjustment that followed was harder. Clothing for us all, learning to move beyond the simple things were were programmed to be when we lie within our pods.”

  
  


“What were you taught within the pod? I’m struggling to understand why a large group of transparent men of enormous stature would be in mass demand beyond military applications. Or perhaps policing. But the fact your instinct with a rifle was to swing it like a club rather than fire it tells me that you weren’t intended to be a fighter.” Observer Wu states and Sarkonic nods.

  
  


“You’re right. We weren’t ready for violence. We were made to be art pieces. We weren’t given the full information as to who our... funder? The Customer? Whoever she was she wanted to look good. Every brother, and myself, came out of our pods knowing how to keep ourselves in shape, how to pose and how to paint ourselves artistically.” Sarkonic says. “What I’m using now is considered ultra-minimalist. Just a series of lines to outline where I am. Wearing this kind of paint is... downright compulsive.”

  
  


“So someone poured what must have been... potentially millions of not billions into making twenty thousand large burly men who are invisible, but compelled to highlight themselves with body paint?”

  
  


“Yes.”

  
  


“And when the men escaped they sent a mercenary force after them?” Observer Wu asks in an incredulous tone.

  
  


“Yes.”

  
  


“Quite the day.”

  
  


“It wasn’t over though.” Janet says.

  
  


“It wasn’t?”

  
  


“It was barely time for lunch, and my son had been shot in the stomach, helped rescue many thousands of men and fight back an enemy fleet. He had healed up and escaped the medics within the hour and was back to things. Seeing to it that the Gathara men were good and situated was one issue, and seeing to the captured mercenaries was another. Not all were killed straight out after all.” Janet explains and Sarkonic checks his communicator before letting out a hum.

  
  


“That’s right it... hmm... I’m out of time. I’ll be heading out now.” Sarkonic notes as he deactivates the stasis on the frozen cup of coffee and then picks up the whole thing. “If I don’t head home and head to bed now, I’ll never wake up in time for what’s up after.”

  
  


Then he bites a chunk out of the mug and ice underneath and there’s an accompanying crunching and munching sound for a few moments as he finishes off the entire thing in three bites with appropriate chewing.

  
  


“Delicious as always. You know where to get the best dishes.” Sarkonic notes before tossing the last piece of the handle in his mouth and chewing. “Where’s my tab at?”

  
  


“You’re well paid off, get moving before the cold drops you in the street.” Janet says kindly and Sarkonic lets out a deep yawn before reaching for something sewn into his jacket, then vanishing in a teleport.

  
  


“Did I just miss someone?” Hoagie asks coming back in.

  
  


“You’re back! What was happening?”

  
  


“Smuggler stand off. Some people get stuck on paranoid mode and don’t realize that what’s illegal in one place or another generally isn’t even getting a passing comment here. A few girls hired for repairs stumbled on a hidden chamber, set off a dozen or so alarms and I’ve spent this entire time either knocking out idiots or talking down the not quite so trigger happy.”

  
  


“What were they smuggling?”

  
  


“Weapon components. There are a few pieces to plasma rifles where certain polities require all of the legal ones to have a kill switch, meaning a popular mod is to have basically two of them so the weapon registers as having the kill switch and it even working. Then the flick of some hidden switch or the press of a hidden button and presto, gun that works regardless of what the law says. As you can guess, they go for quite a bit, but people are really, really jumpy about them being found.”

  
  


“I can understand. But are you alright with them being smuggled?”

  
  


“There are roughly... thirty polities within a few week’s travel that have a ban like that. And to be frank... all of them either have much, much bigger problems or deserve people getting around their bans.”

  
  


“Problems such as?”

  
  


“It’s a turbulent galaxy sir. You’re asking me to summarize the political issues of thirty different states, each one with a population rivalling if not surpassing that of China. The smallest ones are stations like Octarin Spin here. The biggest is no less than twenty systems in size with a total of... eighteen primary worlds, thirty two colonized moons, eight colonized planetary rings, twelve stations of a similar size to this one and... six nomadic fleets I think?”

  
  


“And Octarin Spin doesn’t have such restrictions?”

  
  


“It’s not so much a restriction as an understood consequence. You can have whatever toy you like on the spin, but if you start breaking it with that toy then you go out the airlock without an EVA suit. I think it works better myself. But I’m admittedly biased.”

  
  


“I see... but please, a summary would be nice? What bigger problems do they have, or how do they deserve this?”

  
  


“Well that big one I mentioned has an active civil war going on due to massive amounts of corruption, but the revolution is already falling to it’s own corruption so it looks like we have a massive wildfire spreading there that is going to need to burn itself out. A few stations are downright abusive to their workers with ruinous contract clauses just barely north of slavery and people need a way to tell them where to stick it.”

  
  


“I can’t imagine plasma weapons are easy to come by in such places.”

  
  


“They’re not, but these modifications can be put into plasma tools as well, letting them being converted from mining torches and welders into energy weapons. It’s also one of the harder to craft components, meaning that a skilled engineer or mechanic can put together the rest of the weapon around these parts.”

  
  


“An interesting turn of events, although I do have some further questions.”

  
  


“Go ahead.”

  
  


“Your mother was telling me about the first noteworthy day she was here with us. We were at the part when the mercenary fleet was beaten back and you were taken to medical with a stomach wound. Care to finish things up?”

  
  


“Certainly, but memorable days are memorable because unusual things just keep happening. So it was just getting started.”
