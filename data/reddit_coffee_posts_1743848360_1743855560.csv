1js24rm,https://i.redd.it/im1m2cydd0te1.jpeg,Dating Pool ◇,"Nowadays when discussing the dating pool; there basically two options out there - online and real life dating.

So I'm just gonna give out my own personal opinion on the matter based on my experience from about 10 years or more.

Let's start with online dating.

The first thing that comes to mind, is that it used to be much better back in the day.  The Internet was something hip and trendy and you could actually meet some cool people out there in Tripoli and the general environment was much, much safer before all those creeps, scammers and thugs got their fingers on a keyboard.

You only had to do very little skimming on social media - it was mostly FB platform - and most likely you could find company employees killing time from their office pc and Internet access.  Internet cafes were a thing and people would spend an hour or two ""surfing"" the internet and checking their email account.  

It was actually cool in the sense that you get to go outside, have a coffee ( and smoke inside lol ) while being online and surrounded by different people - it was a social gathering and often times you could meet girls too. 

Its not uncommon to strike a conversation or ask for help from the guy next to you or maybe become new friends and go out for a snack.

At anyrate people felt safer to meet online dates because it just meant that they were somewhat well-to-do and progressive.  

It was the ideal outlet for those looking for friendship, marriage or simply down to fucking after the first date.

Nowadays online dating is a cesspool and I've honestly stepped back from the scene since maybe 2018 and that's kinda late too.  

I don't know if its the dating scene or society as a whole; but there's just tons of freaks out there with very distorted agendas or plans you don't wanna be part of.

Generally speaking, I don't go on blind dates and a video call for reassurance is a must.  

The first time I ever got married was from FB 😅 albeit it only lasted a month and it took 2 years to divorce.  

My last gf ( post divorce ) was also met on FB - she turned out to live near my place, freshly divorced too and we spent the past 4 beautiful years together.

Today I only trust people ( potential dates ) that I meet in person here and there - although its not easy to meet women in the real world, since there aren't that many ( if any ) opportunities to interact with the opposite sex in Libya.

Over the past few years I've developed a knack for nurses and pharmacists ( such as my ex ).  Its easy to get their WhatsApp number with the pretext that I might need to ask about some meds or need advice bla bla bla and we both know its a load of BS 😄 but it works in most cases.

Other than that, there's no other way of meeting women outdoors - im not into cat calling girls from a street corner nor am i into asking girls for their number at intersection stoplights anymore. 

I guess being younger does make you more self confident and somewhat crass. 

Oh and supermarkets.

If some lady asks me to help her grab something from the top shelf or asks me ""have you tried this product ? Is it any good ?""
There's a good chance that we'll exchange contacts before heading to the cashier.

All in all I don't trust online dating anymore, since people can easily hide their true nature and identity behind fake texting, profiles, filters etc. and its literally a can of worms out there.

Meeting potential dates in the real world is the way to go; a sort of reverse trend if you will.

i (19f) have never been in a real relationship - mostly due to my overbearing mother, being isolated at home most of my life, and also having BPD.

i’ve recently met this really sweet guy (20m) at an event and i instantly connected with him. for most of the night we talked and held each other when it started getting cold outside. it was the closest i’ve been to a person in a really long time (not since some less than fond times when i was still in high school).

i gave him my number, and he texted me soon after the event ended. i was so excited to have him in my contacts and i dreamt about him *all night*. 

we went on a real date within 2 days of first meeting, and it was the most fun i’ve had in years. we talked all day, and i mean *all day*. morning to sunset. we drove around town and i showed him all the cool places i know from when i went out back in school. we got coffee and food and candy and played a card game. he told me about his past and i told him about mine. we relate on a lot of things and it feels so good to have someone who understands a lot of what i’ve gone through. 

this all sounds so good typing it out, but i still feel like i can’t believe any of it. this is where my problem lies and i need some advice.

i’ve been bouncing between completely adoring everything he tells me about himself and his life and completely believing that he’s lying to me about it all. this, i know, is a result of the BPD. i’ve been through a lot of trauma and *a lot* of bad experiences with men/people in general. i’m terrified that he’s like everyone else - that he’ll eventually hurt me and try to ruin me. i want to believe he’s a good person. i want to trust him.

he says he’s been through a lot of the same things as i have. we have similar pasts. relate on a lot of things. he told me he’s only dated one other girl before me and that they had a long but hard relationship. she was abusive to him. i feel so sad for him because i know (sort of) how it feels to be abused. he seems scared that i’ll leave him already or that i’ll try to hurt him. i’m scared of the same things.

he repeats to me a lot that he wants to be honest with me and that he wants me to be able to trust him. he seems to care that i’m nervous about this relationship - like he doesn’t want me to be scared of him or us together. it’s new to me and i don’t feel like i can trust it yet. i told him that i’ll need time to trust him, and he seemed relatively okay with that answer. he tends to listen to me when i set boundaries and tell him no - with an exception for buying little things for me like candy and drinks but he will still listen if i buckle down on my answer.

i don’t know how to feel more comfortable with him. i want to be. i want to get to know him more. i’m just so, so scared of him using me. i can’t trust my gut because it always tells me something is wrong no matter what the situation is. i just love how i feel with him, even if i’m anxious at the same time. he makes me feel anxious in a good way mostly. my anxiety is less focused on stupid things when i’m with him, but still there. he makes me feel happy and giddy. i laugh a lot with him and smile a lot more than i ever do at home.

i’d like some advice on how to know if a guy is genuine. if he really does like me and wants to treat me well and get to know me. i’m worried i’ll get too anxious to see him or talk to him again. we have another date planned for the next upcoming days and i would like to get this advice before then!!",1,1743855176.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1js22jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreserveThatFood/comments/1js22jl/how_vacuum_sealing_keeps_food_fresh_longer/,How Vacuum Sealing Keeps Food Fresh Longer,"# Chef's Guide: Vacuum Sealing Revolution - Extend Your Food's Life by 5x!

Hello fellow food enthusiasts! As a professional chef who's obsessed with reducing food waste and preserving peak flavors, I'm excited to share how vacuum sealing has revolutionized both my professional and home kitchen. This scientifically-proven technique can extend your food's shelf life up to 3-5 times longer than conventional storage methods!

## The Silent Food Killer: Oxygen

In professional kitchens, we know that oxygen is the enemy of freshness. Here's what happens when air meets food:

* Oxygen feeds aerobic bacteria and mold, accelerating spoilage
* It triggers oxidation, causing fats and oils to become rancid
* It activates enzymatic browning (that's why your sliced apples turn brown)

By creating an anaerobic environment through vacuum sealing, we essentially press pause on these decay processes. This simple principle transformed how top restaurants maintain ingredient quality and has become accessible for home cooks too!

## Why Every Home Cook Needs a Vacuum Sealer

After years in professional kitchens, I can't imagine life without vacuum sealing. Here's why it's so powerful:

* **Preserves Quality**: Maintains original flavors, textures, and nutrients
* **Prevents Freezer Burn**: Creates an airtight barrier against moisture loss
* **Reduces Food Waste**: Extends usability window of ingredients
* **Saves Money**: Buy in bulk and preserve smaller portions
* **Enhances Cooking**: Perfect for sous vide and marination

## Best Foods for Vacuum Sealing (Chef-Approved)

| Food Category | Normal Shelf Life | Vacuum Sealed Shelf Life | Chef Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Meats/Poultry | 6-12 months (frozen) | 1-3 years (frozen) | Perfect for portion control |
| Fish | 3-6 months (frozen) | 1-2 years (frozen) | Maintains delicate textures |
| Hard Cheeses | 1-2 weeks | 4-8 weeks | Pre-slice for convenience |
| Berries | 1-3 days | 1-2 weeks | Flash freeze before sealing |
| Coffee | 2 weeks | 1+ year | Preserves aromatic oils |
| Nuts | 2-3 months | 1-2 years | Prevents rancidity |

**Pro Tip**: Avoid vacuum sealing soft cheeses, mushrooms, and fresh soft herbs – their delicate structure can't handle the pressure!

## Essential Vacuum Sealing Equipment

From my experience, here's what you'll need for effective vacuum sealing:

1. **Vacuum Sealer Machine**: Choose between countertop models (more powerful) or handheld versions (more portable)
2. **Quality Bags/Rolls**: Look for BPA-free, freezer and microwave-safe options
3. **Specialized Attachments**: Consider jar sealers for dry goods and marinators for quick flavor infusion
4. **Labels/Markers**: Always date and identify contents (crucial for rotation)

## Chef-Proven Vacuum Sealing Techniques

After thousands of hours preserving ingredients, here are my top techniques:

* **Pre-freeze Delicate Items**: Flash freeze berries, sliced fruits, and softer items before sealing to maintain structure
* **Double Seal Edges**: For long-term storage, create two seal lines for insurance
* **Leave Headspace**: Allow at least 1 inch at the top of bags for proper sealing
* **Blanch Vegetables**: Quick-blanch vegetables before sealing to deactivate enzymes and preserve vibrant colors
* **Dry Everything Thoroughly**: Moisture is the enemy of a good seal

Vacuum sealing has saved my restaurants thousands in reduced waste while maintaining exceptional quality. For home cooks, it's a game-changer that pays for itself within months through decreased food waste.

They insisted that I join them for coffee. I agreed, and off we went. After some time, my brother complemented how well my skin glowed in the light of the setting sun. His gf joined in, saying how well I'd transformed after boards.
 She asked what I had been doing and I gave a generic reply somewhat similar to ""eating clean, mostly"". My brother, out of nowhere turned to his gf and told her that told that she needed to take some tips from me since she'd been looking ""real tanned and bloated lately"" (his exact words) and faintly laughed. Like ACTUALLY softly laughed. This was quite careless from his side, since he knows she's been stressed due to work. This was quite obvious and even I knew that. (Shes an article at deloitte, and stressed due to financial year ending workload)

To this, I was disgusted honestly because she truly looks like and is an actual ANGEL. His gf just looked at me, then at her drink and didn't say anything. (Shes the type to avoid kalesh as much as possible).
I asked my brother what the hell was wrong with him and how this was a real shitty thing to say. He tried to play it cool like it wasn't a big deal, and put his arm around her shoulder, but her face clearly said the opposite. 
I then went off on him, told him how pathetic his comment was, and how he needed to apologise right now. 
He didn't say anything for a few moments. I then looked at his gf and said how beautiful she was and she didn't need to change anything for anyone; and to not let anyone get to her.

Silence followed. We soon left and separted paths. I was quite startled, and went home. Overthinking won over me, and I didn't know what to feel. That night, his gf texted texted me, mostly thanking me. After some messages, she told me that she was planning to break up with him; and how this was not the only incident where such thing had happened.

Honestly, I wasn't trying to be a hero or anything, but I couldn't let him disrespect her. Idc if he's mad at me, but I'm gonna visit her and have a long talk. 
Even if they break up, I'm sure imma be in touch with her. Just wanted to get this off my chest, thanks for reading <3.",4,1743855120.0,OffMyChestIndia,3,1.0,False

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

See the bottom paragraph to read about the **Kendu Standard**

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!

Kendu Creator is a website that allows people to 3d print a Kendu mask to make videos on social media. These videos can be non crypto related like taekwondo or running or weightlifting, with these videos flooding social media, Kendu is gonna extend its reach even further!!!   
If one of these videos go viral, Kendu will see massive gains

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Some Thoughts About Previous Successful Coins**

Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins reached face melting ATHs.   
Shib, Doge and Pepe all proved that all you need is a solid community, KOLs don't matter and that the only thing you need is an army of obsessed workers. This is what Kendu has.  
With more money in crypto, far more understanding and belief in memecoins and a proven path, Kendu can top the highs of the previous memecoin hall of famers, Kendu belongs up there with them.  
Kendu is everywhere on social media and we are matching what Pepe, Shib and Doge managed on their run to the top.  
IRL we clear every memecoin ever, all the signs are there

At Kendu, the mission is simple.... we build, build, build until we reach the stars.

**The Kendu Standard**

What is the Kendu Standard?

It is the standard to which Kendu is setting, the standard to which all memecoins will aim to meet after Kendu runs to the billions. Kendu is revolutionising the game with its IRL products and events, the sheer amount of quality and quantity of Kendu's IRL alpha has never been seen or done before..... no coin comes close.  
The Kendu standard is the metrics we try and hit when we engage with social media posts and it is the standard we give ourselves. 

Shib, Pepe, Doge or whatever coin that has existed before, has came nowhere near to Kendu's IRL expeditions and soon with enough holders, Kendu will top every coin in social media metrics. This is the Shib opportunity of 2025, but we are not copying Shib, we are transforming the memecoin game.

**Join the winning team, join Kendu**

Check out our tg, you don't need to be a holder and just get a feel for the Kendu vibe. I am sure you will love it : ) We are a very welcoming and hard working community and any questions are always welcome!

We use our coffee table both as a foot rest and a place for drinks, toys, etc. So i just don’t know how annoying it would be to have to use a tray if we got an ottoman.

1js207a,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1js207a/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 05/04/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamTrades](https://www.steamtrades.com/user/76561198074920693)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1js1ycm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hozier/comments/1js1ycm/i_am_writing_love_letters_inspired_by_lyrics_do_i/,I am writing love letters inspired by lyrics | DO I WANNA KNOW?,"Have you got color in your cheeks tonight, or has the weight of distance washed you pale, stealing the warmth I used to know, the warmth I once swore was mine? Has time worn you smooth, or do you still carry the ridges of our past, the faint indentations where my fingertips once pressed into your skin like a promise? I wonder if my name lingers at the edges of your lips, if it slips between your teeth when you speak in half-dreams and quiet sighs, if it curls around your tongue like a ghost you can’t quite name, a phantom taste you try to swallow down but never truly can. I wonder if the thought of me is something you try to shake off, like a melody that won’t stop playing, like the ghost of a touch that never quite fades, like a shadow that lengthens when the sun sets but never fully disappears, always stretching, always reaching.

Or do you welcome it? Do you let it curl around your ribs like ivy, winding itself into the hollows of your chest, threading through the spaces I left behind, pressing itself into the shape of something inevitable? I imagine you some nights, eyes half-lidded against the glow of the streetlights, hands resting on the back of your neck, exhaling my name into the dark like a prayer or a plea or something in between, something you don’t dare give voice to in the light of day. I imagine you tracing old conversations in the air with your fingers, the way you used to, as if writing them down might stop them from slipping through the cracks of time, from vanishing like a language neither of us ever truly mastered. Do they slip? Or do they stay, embedded in the fabric of your days, tangled in the quiet moments, woven into the spaces where nothing else quite fits?

Do you know how many times I’ve traced the memory of your hands in the dark? How many nights I’ve reached for something that isn’t there, only to feel the ghost of you brushing against me like a whisper I was too slow to catch? I could swear I felt them just last night, fingertips skimming over my skin like a question never asked, like an answer I never got the chance to hear. I dream about you, about the way you tilt your head when you’re lost in thought, about the way your fingers drum against the table when you think no one’s watching, about the way your breath used to hitch when you were on the edge of saying something real but never quite let yourself. I hear a song, and suddenly, it’s you. You, in every chord, in every lyric, in every note that settles into the marrow of me like an ache I don’t know how to soothe, like a wound that never scabbed over, never healed.

And every night, when the world softens and the sky folds itself into ink, I wonder—do you still hum our song under your breath? Do you turn up the volume when it plays, let it seep into your bones like something sacred, something too deeply embedded to ignore? Or do you change the station too fast, like the sound of it might unravel you, like it might remind you of something you swore you wouldn’t feel again, something you refuse to let yourself remember? I don’t know which answer I hope for more. Because if you still listen, if it still clings to you the way it does to me, then maybe I am not alone in this endless wanting. But if you turn it off, if you refuse to hear it, then maybe it’s because it still matters too much, because it still burns, because it still presses against your ribs the way it does mine, because it still tastes like something you can’t bear to lose again.

I play it on repeat, trying to make sense of the way you still live in the spaces between my breaths, in the pauses between my words, in the silence that follows every almost-confession, every swallowed goodbye, every ache I never found the courage to name.

Some loves don’t fade; they simply settle, lying dormant beneath the skin, waiting for the right kind of light to wake them. And I wonder if you ever feel it stirring—when you sip your coffee in the morning, when you press your forehead to the cold windowpane and watch the world blur beyond it, when you stand in the shower and let the water wash over you like an eraser against the past, like something that should cleanse but never truly does. Does it come back to you then? Does it rise in your chest, unbidden and unshakable, tightening around your ribs like an old ache that never quite healed, like something that never truly learned how to be gone? Or has time worn it down into something small, something fragile, something you can tuck away in the folds of memory without it ever begging to be touched again, without it ever clawing its way back to the surface?

Tell me—have you ever caught yourself reaching for me in the middle of a conversation, like your body forgot we are apart, like your hands still remember the shape of me, like muscle memory is stronger than time? Have you ever, just for a second, let your heart stumble, let it wonder if maybe, just maybe, we could still fit? If we could still be something more than a memory, more than a song that lingers but never plays in full, more than a past tense that refuses to stay buried?

I have. I do. More often than I’d like to admit. In the quiet moments, in the loud ones, in the spaces where you should never exist but somehow always do. I reach for you in laughter, in sorrow, in the hush of a room that has held us both and the roar of a world that never did. And sometimes, when I catch myself, I don’t pull back. I let myself imagine. Imagine your breath against my neck, the weight of your head on my shoulder, the warmth of your hand reaching, anchoring, knowing.

There are things we only say in the thick of night, when reason is soft and honesty is sharp, when the past and the present blur into something that feels dangerously close to real. And God, love, if I could gather every unsaid word between us, if I could press them into your palms like a secret meant only for you, would you listen? Would you hear the way my heart still calls for you, the way it has never quite learned to be silent, the way it still echoes with the shape of your name, the way it still beats in time with something that should have ended long ago but never really did?

Or would you close your fingers around them, hold them tightly, keep them close, like something precious, something breakable, something that still means more than you ever let on? Would you let them settle into your skin the way you once let me settle into your life, the way I did so easily, so thoughtlessly, as if I belonged there, as if you wanted me there? Or would you let them slip through your fingers, like sand, like light, like the passing of something you once wanted but no longer need—like something that once fit so perfectly but now only lingers as an ache too distant to hold, too sharp to forget, too quiet to drown out?

Tell me, love—does it still hurt? Or have you finally found a way to live without the ghost of me pressing against your ribs?

Because I haven’t. I don’t know if I ever will.

1js1yc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Viidith22/comments/1js1yc3/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743854746.0,Viidith22,1,1.0,False

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743854201.0,SlumberReads,1,1.0,False

# APRIL 4th 2025~US reciprocal tariffs to hit rare earth magnets, upstream products exempt

[US reciprocal tariffs to hit rare earth magnets, upstream products exempt - Adamas Intelligence](https://www.adamasintel.com/us-reciprocal-tariffs-to-hit-rare-earth-magnets-upstream-products-exempt/)

https://preview.redd.it/ye5mbmuf70te1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2d8430a30df8d727245b46cce72c3bed66934d9

This week, the US announced sweeping “reciprocal import tariffs” on 186 countries and territories to come into effect in two phases.

Starting April 5, 2025, all countries and territories will be tariffed at a rate of 10%, over and above any existing tariffs or levies in place. As of April 9, 2025, higher country-specific tariffs will apply, over and above existing tariffs and levies prior to April 5th.

The latest round of world-reaching reciprocal tariffs follows the imposition of 10% import tariffs on China in February followed by an additional 10% in March. When China’s 34% country-specific tariff comes into effect next week, the US will be levying a combined 54% import tariff on imports of goods from China, with some exemptions.

In February and March, the tariff increases on China were articulated as applying to “all articles” imported from the nation. However, the US International Trade Commission ultimately published a list of HTS product codes in March for which the tariffs apply and rare earth products, including magnets, were not on the list, indicating they are exempt by omission.

Accompanying the latest announcement of reciprocal tariffs this week, the US published an annex of exemptions, which includes REE metals, REE compounds, and mixtures thereof, but does not include neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) or samarium-cobalt (SmCo), suggesting the baseline 10% tariff increase from April 5th and the higher country-specific rates from April 9th will apply to rare earth permanent magnets but not upstream products.

Irrespective of US plans to tariff imports of magnets from China, the latter today announced plans to restrict exports of high-performance magnets and other rare earth products on grounds of national security.

LAS VEGAS - MP Materials (NYSE: MP) has received a $58.5 million award to advance its construction of America’s first fully-integrated rare earth magnet manufacturing facility. The Section 48C Advanced Energy Project tax credit allocation was issued by the IRS and Treasury following a competitive, oversubscribed process administered by the Department of Energy that evaluated the technical and commercial viability and environmental and community impact of approximately 250 projects.

Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets are the world’s most powerful and efficient permanent magnets. They are an indispensable component found in the electric motors and generators that power hybrid and electric vehicles, robots, wind turbines, drones, electronics, and critical defense systems. Global demand is expected to triple by 2035.

MP Materials began constructing its Fort Worth, Texas, manufacturing facility in April 2022. The company is currently producing magnet precursor materials in a North American pilot facility. It expects to commence commercial production of precursor materials in Fort Worth this summer and finished magnets by late 2025. MP will supply these products to General Motors, its foundational customer, to support its North American EV production.

MP will source the factory’s raw material inputs from Mountain Pass, California, where MP owns and operates America’s only scaled and operational rare earth mine and separations facility. At the factory, NdPr oxide produced at Mountain Pass will be reduced to NdPr metal and converted to NdFeB alloy and finished magnets, delivering an end-to-end supply chain with integrated recycling and world-class sustainability.

According to a Section 232 investigation completed by the Department of Commerce in 2022, sintered NdFeB magnets are ""required for critical infrastructure"" and ""irreplaceable in key defense applications,"" yet the U.S. is ""essentially one hundred percent dependent on imports,"" posing a serious national security risk. More than 90% of the world’s NdFeB magnets are produced in China.

Jaipur's cafes were a regular chill spot for me and my friends. We'd often meet up at a cafe, at least 4 evenings a week, to chill.

The food prices of cafes in Jaipur have gotten absolutely absurd, to the point that I sometimes find them to be more expensive than Bangalore for the quality of food being served.

Jaipur had a great pre-COVID coffee scene, with Curious Life and Half Light as notable roasters. Unfortunately, I feel the quality of their drinks has recently plummeted,at their outlets, particularly at Half Light's C-Scheme outlet after their expansion and staff reshuffle.

Pizza places like Napoli charging upwards of 600rs for a pizza that could barely serve 1 person with an appetite and what the fuck is that chilli oil?   

Honestly, I still think that OTH is one of the only hotspot cafes that justifies their price point a bit, even though they too have decreased their quality a bit, but the impact on my experience is not as negative as others.

I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”  ",1,1743853591.0,CreepsMcPasta,1,1.0,False

1js1m3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantsInTheUK/comments/1js1m3h/shower_drain_pipe_disconnected_and_mould_in_floor/,Shower drain pipe disconnected and mould in floor cavity,"Hi all, apologies, quite a long one but never really had a major issue with a landlord before so want to ensure I give all the detail that might be important.

For the past few months there has been a leak in our flat building for which landlord and his workers have been unable to find the source, and eventually narrowed it down to our flat. 

Last Friday (the 28th of March), they took the tiling off the side panel of our flatmate's bathtub and cut a hole in the flooring below the bathtub to look for the leak but found nothing. After liaising with the landlord, it was decided it would be easier to pull up a section of our (mine and my partner's) bedroom carpet to better locate the source of the leak.

This past Monday, a plumber and a contractor came round to do this (were supposed to be here between 1 and 2, shock horror they arrived past 2) and found that our en suite shower's drain pipe is disconnected completely, and has just been draining into the floor cavity below us. Unsurprisingly, there is lots of black mould down there, lots of moisture, and pools of water. The plumber and landlord agreed between themselves that the plumber would be back the next day to repair the pipe and wet-vac, which was relayed to us. My partner questioned whether the mould would be treated as he and my flatmate both have asthma and have been experiencing worsening breathing problems for several months, to which the plumber just said they'd give it a clean. My partner said again that the mould would need to be treated, and the plumber just said they would be back tomorrow at '9ish'. Once they leave, my partner finds a bundle of fibreglass insulation underneath my desk that they either forgot to put back or forgot to dispose of, which my partner had to bag up.

Monday afternoon, our flatmate sends an email to the property manager (≠ landlord) to document what was found with an attached video, the plumber's plan to wet-vac, and requesting clarification as to whether they would actually treat the mould, mentioning her asthma flare-ups. No response is received.

Tuesday morning at 9:55 (loose ish apparently) the plumber and an apprentice arrive and tell my partner their plan to wet-vac as much water as possible, treat the mould with some 'mould detergent', and then let the rest air out to dry as much as possible. We all leave them to get to work, and my partner makes them teas and coffees.

Coming up to lunch time, myself, my partner, and our flatmate decide we will be taking the dogs for a walk soon during my lunch break from work (I wfh, usually in the bedroom, but had moved to the kitchen for obvious reasons; partner and flatmate are both students). I ask the workers if it's okay to grab some things from the bedroom, to which of course they say it's fine, and the apprentice tells me he's ""stolen"" (to mean used without asking) my charger, to which I just say it's fine, although after reflection of that later I was not happy about not being asked and our electricity being used without consent. 

While I'm grabbing my things, I notice they've used my face flannel that lives on our towel radiator in the bathroom to wipe up sludge or something (it's scrunched up and covered in brown stains), and the bathroom is quite messy (dirty/mouldy water on the toilet bowl, dirt/mould on the floors) but I didn't say anything partially because I'm a chicken and partially because, in the case of the dirty bathroom, I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt that they'd clean up before they left. I'm very precious about my belongings and can be slightly germaphobic, so the fact that they: 1) touched my face flannel at all, 2) used it for something so disgusting, 3) didn't even think to ask if it was okay they used it, at which point I could have said no and offered one of our many cleaning cloths, and 4) didn't even bring their own supplies for this -- made me feel incredibly upset/angry/disrespected/slightly violated in a way.

As I'm getting ready for our dog walk in my flatmate's bathroom, they asked my partner if it was alright that they go for lunch, and they left. After they've gone, naturally the 3 of us are being nosy and looking at the progress, and as well as the state of the bathroom, we notice: coffee rings on my desk (with an unused coaster sat mere inches away - and in fairness we didn't think to ask them to use this as it's natural for us, but still), black/brown marks on our bed, the carpet underlay is wet, and that the entire time they've been there (about 3 hours so far), they haven't opened the window for ventilation (they've been working with the door closed as the area is right behind the door) so our bedroom is just being filled with mould spores. Obviously I immediately open the window.

Talking together (myself, partner, and flatmate) about all this, my partner also mentions that he saw the plumber sitting in my office chair, and that he thinks he saw the apprentice vaping in our room but isn't 100% sure. My partner also mentions he doesn't know if they have a key to get back in (he didn't think to mention we were leaving soon), to which both flatmate and I say it's not our problem if they're unprepared, and we head off on our walk. Admittedly, we could have told them we were planning to leave, but we weren't best pleased with them and flatmate and I were a bit petty because of that.

About 10 or so minutes into our walk, we see them ring the Ring, but they've annoyed us a fair bit already so we decide to let them figure it out themselves. 10-15 minutes later they text my flatmate asking if anyone is in, to which she says no, and they tell her they'll get the master key from downstairs (plumber lives in the flat building on the floor below us). When we get back about 20-30 minutes later, the floor is sealed back up and they're gone, otherwise everything has been left as is (dirty bathroom, things they've moved to get under the floor not put back), and we find dirty handprints on the wall - but they have put the charger they used back where it came from, and their cups & mugs in the sink.

My partner and flatmate wanted to check what they'd done, so they pulled the carpet back up (it hadn't been properly reattached), unscrewed the flooring, and ran the shower to assess whether the problem had actually been fixed, which it had. However, there was still an inch or so of water remaining (bearing in mind this cavity is under the majority of the flat, so a large area), a strong smell of bleach, a mouldy slab of (possibly) plasterboard loose, and still plenty of mould/sludge remaining -- it seems they've cleaned the area directly under the hole, but it looks like it's mostly just been pushed further into the cavity, with the remainder of the area still with visible mould/sludge. Partner and flatmate took pictures and videos, then properly reattached the carpet (stretching it onto the grippes and using a knife to push the edges down).

Later that afternoon, we finally receive an email back from the property manager saying that the area would be 'thoroughly wet-vacuumed and treated with a proprietary mould-killing solution to eliminate any spores'. We had seen on the Ring camera that when they had returned from lunch that they were carrying a bottle of Easy bleach, which must be the 'proprietary mould-killing solution' they refer to, though we've read online that bleach is not really suitable for killing mould. The property manager also mentions that our 'health and comfort are a priority' and we can move into another flat in the building when one becomes available if we'd like, presumably so they can get someone in here who doesn't know they're breathing in so much mould.

The en suite shower after all this these past few days has also been draining terribly slowly, getting so bad that my partner had to plunger it several times last night after I'd only been in there 10 or so minutes, which I'm sure must be related.

So that's the situation. We have yet to respond to that email because the rest of the week has been quite hectic, and I wanted us to seek advice before we said anything. We plan to reply explaining what actually happened, with a complaint about the plumber and apprentice's behaviour -- yes, some of the things they did was quite minor and may be typical for workmen, but I think it's important to note it all as it all helps to paint a picture of people who are disrespectful and not doing their job very well --, and would like to request them to properly treat the mould/just do a better job in general.

What else should we be doing/saying/asking for?

I’ve had an echo nearly 2 years ago now and a 24h monitor. It was a very good day when I had that monitor in and showed only 2 PVCs. The had an events monitor on 10 years ago that showed NSVT. I’m not on any meds. 

End of Jan I had a flare up that lasted 16/17 days then resolved on its own. I was eating a clean diet c drinking only water and lowering stress levels as much as possible as it was a pretty hard time then with my husband being unwell. However out of the blue two nights ago mines flared again and have been there constantly ever since. They keep me from falling a sleep at night and if I do managed then they always wake me up. Still eating a clean diet high in potassium/magnesium. No coffee, chocolate or fizzy drinks. Has anyone just had flare ups for no reason at all? I’m so scared that they just keep increasing all the time. I will be calling and making an app a cardiologist Monday. 

Just to add, I have no other symptoms with these like dizziness short of breath or anything it’s literally just the anxiety they bring that I have along side them. Thanks in advance guys. Nicole ",1,1743853527.0,PVCs,4,1.0,False

1js1lgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1js1lgg/managing_various_task_types/,"managing various task ""types""","i've been wanting to write this up for some time.

*side note: it's always important to realize that structure may not solve for everything and, in fact, things like simply allowing yourself to wander around to see what is seeable that needs to be done can be much better than planning or scheduling work; especially if that keeps you from having to write things down in the first place. in other words, i'd much rather a) have a clean whiteboard which allows me to just wander around and do things in any order incl going down whatever rabbit holes i want to go down than b) write down and artificially ""microsequence"" things that don't need that.*

**types**

PRN (borrowing from the medical term) = as needed, e.g. the kitchen sink or laundry basket is full or the bathroom/floors are visibly dirty or i'm out of chicken (which is primary driver for grocery trips).

periodic = every so often and can be strict, e.g. vacuuming/errands every weekend, or based on time transpired since last completed, e.g. changing sheets one week after the last time they were changed.

*side note: i recently realized that i won't run errands during the week. any errands on my whiteboard during the week were just noise that simply distracted from other, more achievable tasks, and seeing the errands task never get done made me judge myself for not getting it done when it really isn't practical to run errands during the week.*

routine = daily or weekly, e.g. meals, gym, meditate, bedtime routine, errands

one off = one time tasks, e.g. get battery replaced in phone

**example tasks**

copy items for today from paper monthly planner to whiteboard and address texts/emails while coffee is brewing.

*see* that hardwood floors need to be swept and mopped while *wandering around* once all other items on whiteboard are complete. then, complete in chunks of 15-30 minutes over however many days it takes to complete. same goes for deep cleaning kitchen and bathrooms.

clean dishwasher one month since the last time is was cleaned (because it's not always practical to do it exactly on a given day). when cleaning is complete, write down 'clean dishwasher' in paper monthly planner for one month from today. the same process is used for things changing bed linens, clean vacuum filter, clean coffee coffee pot, etc.

weekend tasks = things like running errands incl whole foods (which is difficult to get to during the week), open windows for fresh air, change kitchen/bath towels, vacuum, etc.

prn = grocery (based on when chicken is no longer good), laundry (based on if basket is full), sink (based on whether sink is full), etc.

**various considerations:**

if the timing or frequency of something is based on inexact science, which can be taken into consideration when prioritizing one task over another. for example, the frequency at which I change my bed linens is not an exact science, so if it's a day late or early, no one is going to die.

i generally prioritize more frequent over less frequent periodic tasks. for example, in general, performing a bi-annual task one day late has less impact than performing a weekly task one day late.

where tasks don't cleanly fit into one of the above categories / management processes, i approach tasks and how i manage them as if i was a conductor of an orchestra, where my 'instruments' are various tools and skills i have at my disposal to place information at the point of performance and also aid/reduce EF load. this can very much be more 'art' than science but works beautifully for me.

another metaphor i use is that i'm a project manager and my project team consists of me, myself and I at different points in time and we all need to communicate effectively with each other.

the two prior paragraphs are critical because trying to shoehorn everything into tight, well-defined, computer-programmable algorithms simply is not going to work.

there are lot more things i do to manage my tasks but for now i'll just mention one other recent thing i've implemented and that is assigning 11am to 1pm as 'me time' during work days (I work at home most days) to get anything done that requires me to be away from my computer for more than 15 minutes. this is because 11-1 is lunch-ish time and thus no one will fault me for being away at that time and also people are less likely to reach out to me during that time. so i can sneak out to the grocery or run any emergency errands during this time. now, for some of you and NTs, this may seem obvious, but it was absolutely not obvious to me and i wasn't taking advantage of it until very recently.",1,1743853466.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,1,1.0,False

Yesterday I received my AeroPress Clear and this morning was my first time using it. Was so excited that not happy with one brew, did a second one using the inverted method after the first one dripped too much water before pressing it. Probably too fine grind? Or just the wrong coffee overall.

After those two first attempts I was left with a satisfaction feeling mixed with lots of questions. For days prior to receiving it I’ve been researching the coffee world, falling into rabbit hole after rabbit hole. Grinders, coffee beans, kettles, recipes… It’s a bit overwhelming. 

I need some enlightening, if possible, about grinders (other tips are also welcome!). Thinking about starting to buy coffee beans instead of pre-grind coffee. So I need a grinder. Electric ones are discarded (price-wise, and I think I’ll enjoy the manual process more). I have my eyes on the Kingrinder K6 and, pushing a bit the budget, can higher it up to the 1Zpresso J-ultra. So budget would be from 100€ to 200€.

I don’t mind investing more money if that means getting something that won’t make me yearn other grinders soon. 

Can anyone advise in this regards? Should I go for a cheaper grinder or invest in something more premium? Is it worth the jump? Other brands/models I should be looking at? Should I stick to pre-grind stuff until I find what I really want?

Some quick personal background: I come from using Nesspreso pods daily, tried to go for a Bialetti but returned it instantly after its flimsy quality (have tried other moka pots before), want something quick and unfussy to bring my coffee mug full of flavor to work. Found the AeroPress and want to have the best possible results.

TLDR: New AeroPress user, want to experiment with coffee, need grinder and general advise to enlighten my path.

1js1jni,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1js1jni/my_husband_coming_home_late/,My husband coming home late,"My husband and I both in our early 30s, have been married for 7 years. We have pretty traditional roles when it comes to the housework. We both work full time but he runs a business on the side so I in turn do most of the housework. This had been no issue for us and I really don't mind. He helps with the dishes, laundry and kids when he has some extra time. Overall we have a great marriage. The one thing that gets under my skin is his time management. Mainly when out with his friends. I don't care that he goes out and does stuff, I'm glad he has his own things to do, but sometimes when he's out he'll tell me before he leaves he'll be home around a certain time and it's 2 hours later when he actually gets home. I have anxiety pretty bad so I get anxious when he's not home around when he says he's going to. (This doesn't happen a lot just enough to annoy me). We used to get into fights about it because I felt it was just disrespectful. Well recently I've decided every time he comes home later than he says I've been fucking with him. Not anything crazy, just inconveniencing him. For example if he tells me he's going to be home around 10, I start messing with his shit at 1045. About 10 went out the window at 1030.. we're past ""about"" by that time. My husband is slightly OCD so everything has a place and he doesn't like when things are different. So some examples of what I've done. 1. He wears hats anytime he leaves the house so I hid them all over the house. 2. His socks and underwear have their spots in the drawer so I switch them. 3. I always get coffee ready for the next morning so when he's out late that weekend I make sure that Monday coffee is not ready that morning and he has to get it ready before he goes ( he goes to work 2 hours before me). 4. And my personal favorite. I decided to get really creative and I was super annoyed, I turned all of his clothes inside out. Every. Single. Piece. It was great. And honestly this has been amazing for my anxiety. Hope this helps anyone else! Before anyone comments my husband is cheating. This happens probably once every 3 to 6 months and he's just a social butterfly and has a hard time not talking to people and ending a conversation. 

ETA: Some of you have never joked around with your partner and it shows. Find someone you can mess with and joke with and find someone who's not perfect and fucks up sometimes... seriously no relationship is a perfect hallmark movie. He doesn't go out all the time it's mostly for events. He's not going to the bar every night. He usually comes home has dinner as a family and then is working again until about 10pm. My husband is amazing and I will fight anyone that tries to make it seem otherwise. If you all honestly think a picture perfect relationship exists.

So much of our interests can lead to wasted money, additional clutter, harmful habits, etc. But which ones ended up being useful?

My top 3: 

1. sourdough/breadmaking, 
2. coffee, 
3. Fountain pens/journaling. 

To this day I have the equipment and know-how to brew great coffee (which I still do daily) and bake amazing bread (which I only do now maybe once or twice a month, or on special occasions). And I still have a stash of pens and ink (enough for the next decade or so tbh) which I use every day, though I bought my last new bottle of ink over two years ago.

**Dishonorable mentions:** makeup, skincare, typewriting. 

I spent so much time reading blogs and watching videos... blew SO MUCH money on unnecessary beauty products; a lot of them expired before I could finish them. :( then I just cut down severely on my makeup routine during the pandemic and never went back.

I was also convinced I could be more productive (less distractions) by using a typewriter and of course bought a couple of secondhand typewriters (expensive ones!) asap. Fun at first but I quickly began missing all the advantages offered by laptops. I forced myself to use the typewriters for a few more months before I admotted defeat and gave up on the whole idea.

Side note -- my skincare era did lead me to learn about the importance of sunscreen, and I still manage to remember to use sunscreen maybe 3-4 times a week, so I guess that's a net positive too. :)",4,1743853085.0,ADHD,6,1.0,False

As I sit here in my new and temporary little bedroom with some coffee, I can hear the birds singing everyone awake.  My cat is laying by the open window listening, watching, and maybe even processing her intuitive feeling of hunting.  Probably not.  Who knows.

Should processing emotions come naturally?  I've heard ""process your emotions"" or ""it's going to be a lot to process"" for so long now.  Most of my adult life, actually.  Nobody has ever really explained to me what is supposed to happen once you've processed emotions.  Is the end result supposed to be similar to when we analyze a thought?  As in:  
1. Thought occurs  
2. Analyzation begins, and without any effort, the analytical hell starts rolling  
3. When, why, how, what  
4. Usually no scientific based fact results, but instead just some shit that I've concluded and feel all right with, or something else has sparked my interest and I end up forgetting what I was even analyzing.

So, ""process your emotions.""  
I woke up crying again, feeling a bag of emotions that resulted from a forced break-up, a forced move from the town that I lived in, a forced move-in with my parents, and another day beginning.  I'm not saying that I want an end to my days, but for God sakes, how many days in a row can a person relive the same fucking day?  Relive in the same thought patterns, the same emotions.  
I live in a constant state of anxiety, depression, and grief anymore.

Life has handed me a few dozen lemons.  I never learned to juggle.  I never learned to organize them in the fridge or pantry.  I did learn how to reach behind into my backpack and just kind of shove all of the lemons in there so that I'd have free hands enough to catch whatever other lemons are tossed my way.  The ones in the bag began piling up, so I zipped the backpack tighter.  Now they just sit in there and rot.  Flies circle my backpack.  I swat at them but my hand just mysteriously passes straight through each and every one of the little bastards.  I barely exist.

The hurricane hit on September 27th, and mass flooding destroyed an incredible amount of land in our area.  Driving around like a fucking zombie for the past 6-months, I'm surprised I haven't really even seen the extent of how damaged everything is.  I feel a connection to what I've seen.  The day that the hurricane hit, I felt the opposite of ""coming back down to Earth"" from my normal hiding spot called ""head in the clouds.""  I felt like the Earth was coming up to meet me.  I felt the sense of panic; mine and a lot of other people's.  I felt the sense of calm before the storm a few days prior.  Waking up to the horrific wind, and warnings to evacuate made me move a little slower, a little more paced, calm, and thoughtfully.  I felt more normal than I have felt in years and years.  When I finally went outside and saw what was happening, how people were scattering to get out of town but were barricaded in by pools of electric water, I joined them and felt what I've heard that normal feels like.

When I looked around myself, and saw the devastation occurring, all the shit piling up everywhere, the crying and yelling and panic, the electricity lines down, cable lines all tangled up with one another and everything else, I felt less anxiety than I can ever remember feeling.  I felt at home, and before that, I can only remember one other occurrence where I actually felt ""at home.""  Unfortunately, the first time I felt at home, I can't even remember where or who I was.  It might have been some time in childhood, but I don't even know for certain that I had one of those.

So how does one process emotions?  One at a time?  Each one of my emotions seem to stick with me, like the lemons.  Each emotion seemingly funnels me down deeper into it, or tunnels me over into another emotion.  They just go on and on.  If the finish line of processing an emotion is supposed to result in an end to feeling it, am I supposed to expect that it, or one like it, just won't ever come back?  What about processing the entire package that grief comes in?  I'm not sure that I even know how to feel much else past the feelings that come with grief.

So over the years I've accumulated a lot of GM resources by preparing games, and something I'm particularly proud about, and almost invariably get positive feedback on is the playlists I've curated and play during my games. I have tons of them, and they go beyond the ""quiet tavern with fire crackling"" tracks, and have a more cinematic/movie score approach.

So my idea was to create a website/blog where I can share these playlists and for each one have a companion article describing its uses, anecdotes, musical analyses, or other resources linked to that playlist. I would also like to offer the visitors an opportunity to tip me if they enjoy the content (buy me a coffee style). 

So my question is which platform (website builder or otherwise) would lend itself the best to sharing these sorts of articles, that either has a tipping tool included or that can integrate one (also looking for a tipping tool recommendation in that case).

In addition, I lost enough weight the last 2 years that it warranted essentially replacing everything I had. 

So, in doing this I found myself leaning into the modern minimalism thing a bit. Lots of smart wide leg jeans, plain fitted tops or sweaters, for winter I accessorized with nice wool coats over the top and feel like I got my winter wardrobe down.

But I find myself now with this sense of missing what made me ""me"" in my fashion. I used to wear a lot of very weird things, I like the grown-up direction I've headed, but I have this urge to throw some loud and out-there pieces in. I'm not a neutral girl at heart and as spring and colours arrive in the store, I find myself yearning for expression.

I'm just not sure now if bright colours and loud pieces are tacky, or statement? Does it even matter? Is it all about the confidence you wear it with and not what you wear?

An example - I've been on the lookout for a spring coat lighter than the wool ones I have. I never saw myself as a trench coat person, they just didn't do it for me, but then yesterday I saw and for some reason fell in love with a bright, kind of pistachio green (almost neon but not quite) trench and bought it.

I can see myself floating around town in spring on a sunny day with a coffee in hand and big shades on, just feeling good about myself in this loud vibrant coat.

I also bought this white peplum shirt/blouse thing that is super tailored with big balloon puff sleeves, and could totally see myself wearing it to a semi-formal work occasion or conference with black wide leg pants and some gold jewellery.

I've never considered myself someone who was fashionable or with taste, but as I've gone through this reinvention I do aspire to be cool, put together, a bit unique, without backsliding into whatever my 20s and early 30s were!

Do I need to just own my shit? Is that part of being a BWT?

1js1cqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1js1cqa/early_dating_anxiety/,Early dating anxiety,"Newly-ish single after a breakup in early November. Started going on dates about 2 weeks ago. Have had 3 first dates that were either pretty awkward or pleasant but no chemistry. 

And then I met someone with tons of chemistry. 

All green flags from our initial text exchange. Fun, easy banter. Not jumping into asking for flirty pictures or talking about sex. Thoughtful questions. He initiated a lot of the conversation and responded in a reasonable time but neither of us got too texty. 

First date was a dream. Easy and fun conversation. So much chemistry. We went for a walk after because we didn’t want the date to end (we got coffee in the middle of the day). Walked me back to my car, kissed me, and then texted later telling me how much he enjoyed that and wants to see me again. 

The conversation continued perfectly. We both expressed interest in seeing more of each other. Second date was also a dream … went for a walk to a waterfall. Kissed a lot, felt like teenagers telling each other how much we like each other. 

And then, like an idiot, I ruined it. 

I asked him right after a sweet makeout session if he was doing this with anyone else. He was very honest and said he had one other really great first date, and they have a second date planned. I immediately pulled back away from him. I realize it’s only our second date. But my god did that sting. I wanted to ask more - are you also making out with her? But I didn’t, I was too afraid to hear the answer. 

He was so sweet about it. He’s just starting to date after moving on from a long marriage. He was honest in that he feels chemistry with me and wants to get closer to me. But he also had a wonderful first date with someone else and has another date lined up. 

For me … with that much chemistry and spark, I’ve lost interest completely in anyone else. It really scares me to think he could decide he wants to pursue her and then drop me. It makes me afraid to get closer to him. I’m already scared to lose whatever this could potentially be.

He asked me how I felt. I told him sensibly, I realize of course he wants to date around a little. But I also told him I am starting to have feeling for him and it makes me nervous to get hurt. 

We kind of walked in silence for a bit, he reached for my hand and then pulled me in for a hug and kissed me again.

At the end of our date I asked him to please just be honest with me about where he’s at, and told him I don’t want to move forward intimately until I know that’s not happening with someone else. He totally understood. 

He texted me right after our date that he had a lovely time and likes me again. We have a 3rd date lined up. He also told me he really doesn’t want to hurt me, and that he feels something between us and find himself wanting to get closer to me. Our easy text banter continues. 

But my god. I am terrified he’s also sending the same messages to this other person. Is he also making out with her? 

How do I do this? How do I open up to him and get closer to him while also protecting myself? I don’t believe he’s necessarily doing anything wrong. I just wish he liked me enough to not be interested in pursuing someone else at the same time. I did tell him I’m nervous he’s sharing the same experience with her (kissing / talking a little about sex). He didn’t tell me he’s not. 

Am I totally crazy? I’m so confused. I feel really sad and anxious. I like him so much. I’m so scared he’ll pick her. I’m so scared of feeling rejected. ",1,1743852525.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1js1chd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1js1chd/weird_side_effects/,WEIRD side effects,"Curious about anyone else…

1. Coffee/hot drinks: I don’t want it at all. I used to LOVE my morning coffee and now I force myself to drink it so I don’t get a headache (I still need the caffeine). I don’t want any hot drinks, period.

2. SWEETS: I want sweets! I used to never have a sweet tooth and now I need something every day.

3. Sparkling vs Still: I used to drink a bunch of LeCroixs on a daily basis. Now? I want either plain water OR have been drinking a bunch of Crystal Light. 

4. Perfume: The weirdest one is my perfume. I have been wearing the same scent for 20 years and now I cannot stand it. Smells all weird and powdery on me. 


I don’t know if any of these are connected or if I’ve just ….changed. Anyone? I have been on the shot since Jan.

1js1c7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1js1c7g/guy_made_plans_with_me_to_go_on_a_coffee_date/,Guy made plans with me to go on a coffee date this morning but hasn’t given me a spot to meet,"And if I were to meet him at the time he proposed, I would have to leave in about an hour. It’s about an hour drive for me, so I’m a little irked he hasn’t responded to my last message with a place to meet since he knows I’m driving from out of town. It could be more than an hour, it could be less than an hour depending where in his city. 

I’m an anxious person and stuff like this throws me into a tizzy. I need for plans to be set up ahead of time and even though I’ve inquired with him about where and what time, he only responded with a time and he changed the time from the original at that. 

I already asked where, he hasn’t responded, I’m at the point of wanting to bail but that could be my anxiety taking over. 

I’ll probably follow through, but is this type of flimsiness for a first date to be tolerated? I’m a pretty chill person, but the lack of communication and solid plan making triggers anxiety. 

Would you bail? keep trying? What’s the tolerance threshold for first date plan making to you? 

Edit: This guy ended up cancelling our first date about 45 minutes before I planned to make the hour long drive into his city. I woke up extra early so I had plenty of time to get ready (I really did want to stay in bed). I did start getting ready and then got the message from him. 

Someone here said “don’t blame your anxiety” and that person is right. My anxiety is always trying to tell me something even though it makes me feel crazy and I doubt it. 

I’m let down by this, but I’ve also been really, really let down by dating in general. I think most of us know that feeling of being at the end of our line. It’s this repeated pattern of getting excited about a new prospect only to get let down. And as an anxious brain does, I now keep thinking about my own missteps with a couple of people I dated that didn’t work out, but comparatively, were so much better than this shit. It’s like, had I done this or that, maybe I’d actually be dating someone solid right now. But that’s just me dwelling on the past instead of trying to move forward, but moving forward is just tripping on an uneven sidewalk it seems.

I should probably take a break from dating, but it’s hard when you feel lonely. I get so envious when I see a couple that’s seemingly happy together. I don’t believe I’ve ever felt genuine romantic love which feels extra painful when you are in your 40s. I had one long term relationship, but he was an abuser, so I’ve really wasted my time on bad ones up until this point. 

I’m going to treat myself to something nice today and hang out with my dog. If anything, she shows me love 🐾

It’s not just bad advice—it’s toxic positivity in its purest form. Like telling someone with a broken leg to ""just walk it off.""

**1. It Invalidates Real Emotions**

Imagine venting about your anxiety, and someone hits you with:

""Stop overthinking! Just be happy!""

 🚩 Why it sucks:

It dismisses your feelings like they’re a choice. 

Makes you feel guilty for not being happy.

Ignores the actual problem.

 💡 **What helps instead?**

 ""That sounds really tough. Wanna talk about it?""

""I get why you’d feel that way.""

Just listening without trying to ""fix"" it.

**2. Happiness Isn’t a Light Switch**

If I could ""just be happy,"" don’t you think I would’ve done it before crying into my third iced coffee of the day?

🚩 Why it sucks:

Emotions don’t work like an on/off button.

Forcing positivity can lead to more stress.

Pretending to be happy ≠ actually healing.

💡 **What helps instead?**

""It’s okay to not be okay.""

""You don’t have to force happiness right now.""

""Let’s figure this out together.""

 

**3. It Ignores Mental Health Struggles**

Telling someone with depression to ""just be happy"" is like telling a drowning person to ""just breathe.""

🚩 Why it sucks:

Mental health isn’t a mindset issue—it’s real.

Shaming people for struggling makes it worse.

Real healing takes time, therapy, and support.

💡 **What helps instead?**

""Have you considered talking to someone?""

""You’re not alone in this.""

""What do you need right now?""

**4. Toxic Positivity is Exhausting**

Forcing a smile 24/7 is not self-care—it’s self-betrayal.

🚩 Why it sucks:

Suppressing emotions leads to burnout.

Fake happiness = more stress long-term.

Real growth comes from facing emotions, not avoiding them.

💡 **What helps instead?**

""You don’t have to pretend with me.""

""It’s okay to feel whatever you’re feeling.""

""Let’s take a mental health day.""

**5. What to Say Instead of ‘Just Be Happy’**

If you actually want to help someone (or yourself), try these:

✅ ""I’m here for you.""

✅ ""You’re allowed to feel this way.""

✅ ""What do you need right now?""

✅ ""This sucks, but it won’t last forever.""

 

**Final Thought: Stop Forcing Happiness**

Life isn’t Instagram or Tiktok—you don’t have to filter your emotions.

 

It’s okay to be sad, angry, or just meh. Real growth happens when we acknowledge our feelings, not suppress them.

 

So next time someone tells you to ""just be happy,"" hit ’em with:

""Thanks, I’m cured."" 🙃

 

What’s the worst advice you’ve ever gotten? Drop it in the comments! 👇

 

TL;DR:

 

""Just be happy"" is dismissive & unhelpful. Toxic positivity ignores real struggles .Validate emotions instead of forcing fake happiness.

 

Better alternatives: ""I’m here for you,"" ""It’s okay to not be okay.""

1js14ab,https://i.redd.it/zvctg2a620te1.jpeg,"[BTC] Morning Order Book Breakdown w/ Coffee — April 5, 2025","
Good morning, folks.

While the traditional markets dumped hard yesterday — Nasdaq down over 6%, S&P bleeding too — Bitcoin stayed in its lane. No panic, no collapse. Why?

Because big players are still accumulating in this range. They’re not doing it for a -20% move. They’re preparing for something bigger — likely in response to weakening fiat and macro uncertainty.

⸻

Current Price: $83,642

Order Book: Depth +25%, Volume -1%

CVD: -984 — sellers active, but buyers are absorbing.

⸻

Buy-Side Liquidity (Support Zones):

• $83,600–$84,000 — ~930 BTC stacked

• $84,000–$84,250 — ~650 BTC

• Below $83,500 — thinner zones, but still defended

⸻

Sell-Side Liquidity (Resistance Levels):

• $84,800–$85,000 — ~1,050 BTC

• $85,500 — ~1,350 BTC

• $86,500–$88,000 — heavy liquidity zone, likely stop orders clustered there

⸻

Market Outlook:

Despite the fear in traditional finance, BTC remains in a tight range. That’s not weakness — that’s strength in accumulation. Institutions don’t stack positions in this range just to dump lower.

They’re betting on dollar devaluation — and Bitcoin thrives in that climate.

⸻

Grizzly’s Note:

Let the bots and panic sellers do their thing. We stay cool, calculated, and patient.

And hey — it’s Saturday. Zoom out from the charts a bit.
Spend time with your family. Markets will still be here tomorrow.
Presence with loved ones > perfect entry.

See you in the next squeeze. Stay sharp.

1js144b,https://www.reddit.com/r/queer/comments/1js144b/what_is_my_sexuality/,What is my sexuality?,"so i am still in my teenage years. i live in a small village where basically everyone is homophobic including my family i made a new reddit account because i can't let anyone know i even am asking this stuff so i live in Slovenia which isn't the type homophobic like they are gonna kill you for being gay but you could still get beaten up by other guys your age and especially since i live in a small village everyone is homophobic in the cities it's more normalized but in the village everyone knows each-other. I don't have any intent coming out as anything queer because i don't wanna get shamed and all than and i just wanna be normal and also i am confused about my sexuality i am a male and i am questioning if i am gay or not for example what you need to know about me i am a little chubby so not the prettiest person so i am kind of insecure so for example when i see a guy my age in public that has muscles or is just overall hot i get insecure just for example if i am at a coffee shop and drink my coffee and see a muscular and hot guy i get rather insecure than aroused and would basically leave everything and couldn't even take one more sip of coffee without feeling shitty and like a fatass. (keep in mind i am in my early teenage years so i have not lost my v card) but for older men i'm talking like 18 and more who are muscular i do feel aroused by them but only on internet i couldn't stand a guy same age or a guy older than me being in bed with me because i would just feel so ashamed of my body and wouldn't be turned on at all in a real life scenario now i don't know is this is just because i'm too young or what. also i don't find twinks attractive. And also with men i don't see my future with a guy i don't feel like i would be comfortable saying to a man ''I love u'' or cuddle him but on the other side i can see a future with a woman and i could say to her i love you or cuddle her also i have a very straightforward type with men they need to be muscular but as i mentioned i couldn't have sexual intimacy with him but also not with a girl i don't feel turned on by girls much maybe a little now or i just didn't explore that deep but i feel that's only because i don't feel worthy enough if i were in a fantasy world and i could be hot and muscular i feel like i would be turned on by having sexual activity with a girl because then i would feel like i'm at least worthy of her and by then i feel like i wouldn't even be turned on by a man anymore because i would be enough so i don't know if being into men that would take control is just a coping mechanism that's saying i'm better than you and you are just a worthless dump beneath me. now back to girls i also have a much more specific type with girls and i have never had a crush on a guy because i find guys my age nasty and not my type while with girls i would date a girl or kiss her or say to her i love you but again since i'm ugly in my eyes i don't feel worthy of her and if we were in a bed together i couldn't even take my shirt off without wanting to sink into the ground. my type of girls is also much more complex than men and i would much rather have a crush on a girl than a man also i'd like much more a future including a girl and my type of a girl is to have that kind of y2k vibe and wavy hair maybe a wolf cut. You get the image and i also see much more girls i find hot than guys in public and as i said i never would see my future with a man also because my family is homophobic. so this week for example i saw 2 girls at the mall basically my type and i thought fuck they're so hot if i knew one of them i would for sure have a obsessed crush over them (i already had one big crush on a girl where i stalked her social media) so basically   i like girls on a looks matter and also their personality but i don't feel turned on by them but that may be just because i don't feel worthy of being intimate with her but if i was i guess i would be turned on by her but i don't know if it would be the thought about for example dominating her or just being turned on by myself, So please please tell me what you think my sexuality is because i just feel confused AF. Also i know it sounds so cringe just don't judge me too much pls thank you!😭",1,1743851599.0,queer,1,1.0,False

Priced at 11.99, the game was first announced for mobile on September 27, 2024.

Songs of Conquest Mobile is a fantasy turn-based strategy game set in the world of Aerbor. In this game, you command armies, wage wars in a nostalgic medieval pixelated world, gather resources, uncover the stories of uncharted lands, and more. One of the exciting parts of the game is its four distinct factions, Loth, Arleon, Rana, and Barya, each offering unique gameplay. You can choose your faction in the Conquest mode, enjoying it either on randomly generated maps or on beautiful handcrafted experiences.

The game looks very promising with a 2.5D pixel art design, and you should try it. It features tactical turn-based combat, resource gathering, base building, and army management. Moreover, with four campaigns, you can explore the story of each faction while commanding powerful heroes.

Also I made a Django + HTMX Tutorial Series for Beginners and Nonbelievers,"So like the title says, she insisted Django was just a backend framework and definitely not a fullstack framework. I disagreed. Strongly.

Because with Django + HTMX, you can absolutely build full dynamic websites without touching React or Vue. Add some CSS or a UI lib, and boom: a powerful site with a database, Django admin, and all the features you want.

She refused to believe me. We needed an arbitrator. I suggested ChatGPT because I really thought it would prove that I was right.

It did not.

ChatGPT said “Django is a backend framework.” 

I got so mad!

I showed my friend websites I had built entirely with Django. She inspected them then  said ""Yeah these are like so nice, but like I totally bet they were  hell to build..."" Then she called me a masochistic psychopath! 

I got even more mad.

I canceled all my plans, sacrificed more sleep than I would ever admit to my therapist, and started working on a [coding series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLueNZNjQgOwOviOibqYSbWJPr7T7LqtZV); determined to show my former friend, the world, and ChatGPT that Django, with just a touch of HTMX, is an overpowered, undefeated framework. Perhaps even… the one to rule them all.

I will spare the details, but I know it wasn’t my performance (though they tried to say it was, despite zero warnings and receiving continuous praise). It was the most money I’ve ever made, and I’m still reeling. Nonetheless, it hurt my esteem and has me reconsidering everything. See my background below: 

I started that job to leave ANOTHER not great job in a different field where my manager was on me like a hawk and told me if I wanted to schedule doctors appointments with my current schedule, I should “consider looking into saturdays” 💀

Prior to that, I worked for 2 different news stations. I left the first one to work at the second one because they paid me minimum wage to work overnights and weekends, the 2nd one paid more, but same schedule coupled with a toxic environment. 

All of this has happened in the last 2 and a half years. I know my worth and when to leave. But now, I feel burnt out. Realistically, not many comm. Jobs right now either. At the same time, I don’t want to do it anymore. I hate walking on egg shells. I don’t get gratification worrying about if or when something bad will happen. 

I wish I could leave my city and look elsewhere but my husband is in school and working full time for the next 2 years. I’m proud of him and I understand, so I’m more than happy to support him and in the meantime, hold hope. I also have thought about going back to school in a couple of years to change my career- but I’m not financially ready or emotionally ready yet, to be transparent here. 

That background being said, I am considering taking 2 years off to work at a coffee shop. I used to work part time in coffee while freelance copywriting just before I started my news jobs. The pay wasn’t that awesome but I loved my flexible schedule and was fairly happy. 

Has anyone done this? Did you decide to go back to the corporate world or stay? If so, what did you learn? Are you happy? ",4,1743851177.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

## Why the Right Coffee Filter Matters for Your Cuisinart

Before we dive into specific recommendations, let’s address why selecting the appropriate coffee filter is so critical for your Cuisinart. The filter doesn't just keep grounds out of your coffee; it considerably impacts the overall taste and quality of your brew.

*   **Flavor Purity:** The filter material can affect the coffee's flavor profile. Some filters, like paper, can absorb oils, leading to a cleaner, brighter taste. Others, like gold tone and permanent coffee filters, allow more oils to pass through, resulting in a richer, fuller-bodied cup.
*   **Water Quality:** Many Cuisinart models utilize charcoal water filters, which remove chlorine, minerals, and other impurities from the water before it reaches the coffee grounds. This directly improves the taste of your coffee.
*   **Machine Longevity:** Using the correct type and size coffee filter for Cuisinart ensures proper water flow and prevents grounds from clogging the machine's internal components, prolonging its lifespan.
*   **Environmental Impact:** The choice between disposable paper filters and reusable options allows you to align your coffee habit with your sustainability goals.
*   **Cost-effectiveness:** While reusable filters have a higher upfront cost, they can save you money in the long run compared to continually buying paper filters.

## Understanding Your Cuisinart Coffee Maker and Its Filter Needs

Not all Cuisinart coffee makers are created equal. Different models require different filter sizes and types. Knowing your specific model is the first step in finding the perfect coffee filter.

*   **Check Your Manual:** Your Cuisinart coffee maker's manual will specify the correct filter size and type.look for facts regarding the basket size (e.g., 4-cup, 12-cup) and whether it requires cone-shaped or basket-shaped filters.*   **Filter Basket Inspection:** Visually examine your filter basket.Is it a cone shape, or does it have a flat bottom? This will determine whether you need cone or basket filters. Also, measure the basket if you are unsure of the size coffee filter for Cuisinart you require.

https://reddit.com/link/1js0zs8/video/m600tm1l00te1/player

After extraction when I removed the portafilter( i think I removed it 3-4 mins after extraction) it came out sludgy and not turgid. Is this bcoz i left it there or is there a different reason. A possible reason also could be that I used 16g, not 18g altho the portafilter is designed for 16-18g, 16g with this fine grind might be little too low.

This group has been very helpful to me since getting my first lipd panel on February 10th. Thought I'd share my progress and what worked for me. Hope it helps.

38m, 5ft8, Starting Weight 218, Current Weight  185.

 That weight loss happened in the 2 months as well.

Tests were 2 months apart.

Weight - 218 to 185
Total cholesterol - 339 to 168
HDL - 50 to 38
Triglycerides - 195 to 112
LDL - 252 to 108
Chol/hdlc Ratio - 6.8 to 4.4
Non HDL - 289 to 130

Still not where I need to be,  but I'm super happy with the progress. Here is what I did.  Hope it helps and let me know if you have questions.....

1) Compounded Wegovy for the Weight loss. This was hands down what made this possible. When I got the first numbers, it scared the crap out if me and I knew I had to make drastic dietary changes. These medications made that transition simple. I responded very well to the medication and the Weight loss was probably a big part of these numbers, but I wasn't suffering while eating healthy smaller portions because of the medication.  So there's the foundation. 

2) Diet. Increased fiber dramatically. Decreased all oils drastically. I use the spray olive oil to really reduce oil. No red meat, pork and eggs. No dairy except for some fat free greek yogurt. No processed foods. Fish, chicken breast, vegetables and brown rice became the base. Beans everywhere i can. Air frying most meats. Overnight oats with chia, ground flax, blueberries, strawberry and banana every day for breakfast. Coffee with almond milk,  and I doubled up on the filters just in case that was an issue. 

3) Metamucil - After every lunch and dinner every day. Any meal that had any saturated fat or oil at all was immediately followed by my orange tang drink. I figured there was enough fiber in the breakfast that I didn't need to follow that meal with it.

4) Exercise. None, I have a shoulder injury that is holding me back. I really want to get back into it, but at this point exercise played no part in these numbers.

Edit**5) Forgot to mention, alcohol.  Completely quit drinking because of the medication. Prior to this,  bottle of wine a night. Pretty bad, I know.  Working on this. 

Hdl drop concerning, so that's something I'll have to keep an eye on.

I'm a divorced father of three and still co-own a house with my ex wife, in which she resides, and our children spend just over 50% of the week. My ex had taken no action to take sole ownership of the property. I live in a studio apartment, and to facilitate an international vacation my ex has planned, I have agreed to stay in the house with the kids for a week. This morning, I received the following document in my email, which seems unreasonably restrictive and vague, and likely designed to be nearly impossible to violate. Considering the fact that I still legally own the property, does this have any merit, and would I open myself up to legal liability if I cook meat in the house, appear to be enjoying myself, or happen to take a photo while on the premises?

Following is the full text of the document with names and addresses removed. Thanks!



House Rules
The below was necessitated because [myrstica] was unable to provide adequate housing for the duration of [myrstica's ex]'s vacation.

By staying in [myrstica's ex]’s home at [street address], Pittsburgh, PA, from April 11 - April 20, 2025, [myrsrica] implicitly agrees to the following rules:
1. No other persons besides [myrstica], [child1], [child2], or [child3] will enter the home, unless there is an emergency.
2. Dog, Isabella, will remain crated at night and at any time there is no active supervision. Dog can
go only in the common areas and [child1]'s bedroom.
3. All dog excrement will be cleaned up promptly and thoroughly, whether in the backyard or
neighborhood.
4. Dog will not be on furniture.
5. Dog will be bathed before entering the home.
6. [Myrstica] will be responsible for any damage the dog causes. He still owes [child1] a rug from last time.
7. Anywhere the dog has been will be cleaned thoroughly, i.e. shampooed/mopped.
8. Cat, Nellie, is to remain crated at all times unless there is completely active supervision. She cannot control her urine output. If she is let out and has an accident, it will be cleaned, and [myrstica] will be responsible for damage.
9. Nellie will need her litter refreshed every 3 days, or as needed. Add additional or dump/replenish.
10. No one will enter [myrsrica's ex]’s bedroom.
11. Privacy of persons and things will be respected to the highest degree - no going through belongings in any area.
12. [Myrstica] will sleep either on the couch or on the floor mattress in the cat room. The sleeping area will be shampooed and/or laundered thoroughly before departure.
13. James will supply his own bedding and towels.
14. Any remaining food in the home is for the children only. [Myrstica] is not allowed to consume food or beverages, whether prepared or packed, at any time, including coffee, tea, eggs, spices, etc.
15. There will be no meat cooked in the home.
16. Anything broken will be the liability of [myrstica] and replaced new or [myrstica's ex]will receive market value.
17. Laundry facilities are not available for [myrstica]'s use. The kids will have ample clean clothing for the duration and laundry won’t be necessary. Exception is potential washing of mattress pad cover.
18. Utilities will be consumed in a way deemed reasonable by most people.
19. Standard rules will be enforced:
a. [Child1]’s weekly chores include: Sunday and Wednesday - feeding and watering chickens,
Monday - garbage, Tuesday - [their] laundry, if needed. Bedtime: 9-9:30
b. [Child2]: putting away dishes once daily, watering seedlings. Bedtime: 8:30
c. [Child3]: feeding/watering cats as needed. Bedtime: 8-8:30
20. Nothing in the house will be changed or amended without explicit consent.
21. Nothing in the house will be documented by any media, by any person, without explicit consent.
22. Use of the home is for care of the children solely. [Myrstica] is not entitled to personal use or enjoyment of the house or property or possessions on it.
23. Ring cameras will remain on and recording at all times. Any “outage”, intentional or otherwise, will result in an emergency dispatch to check on the kids and home.

183.5 cm

83.2 kg

Arab descent

Diagnoses : MDD, GAD, ADHD, IBS, convergence insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency (16 microgram/L, normal range is 30-100), very mild sleep apnea

Medication : 20mg vortioxetine, 40 mg methylphenidate ER twice a day, vitamin D supplement (3100 IU)

Recent tests : blood work fine (including fasting insulin, glucose, insulin resistance markers, lipids, TSH, T4, cortisol, even B12 which is never fine, etc. ), gluten and wheat intolerance related anti-bodies negative, stool culture for major infections negative etc. 

Complaint : 

-Started around 2 month ago. 

-Wanted to trial lifestyle changes again to help with persistent neuro-psychiatric symptoms (I don't respond well to treatments for some reason, so I'm desperate)

-Stopped smoking/vaping, started regular exercise, and started eating better (I was the type to live off snacks/cigarettes/coffee/energy drinks untill 2pm, then eat fast food/premade plates from the supermarket)

-Severe executive dysfunction has caused me to eat like shit (I procrastinate/forget eating, or don't eat cause I know it'll fuck up my day or I just have a big aversion to food, overwhelmed at grocery stores and grocery shopping etc.), but I was so desperate for any relief from my mental health issues, I pushed through. Stopped fast-food, eating mostly whole foods, 3 times a day, etc. 

Anyway, I quickly started developing strange symptoms : 

- Crashes after eating : depression, anxiety, lethargy, irritability, bloating, teary-eyed, brain and visual fog, exhaustion, cold, sweaty, feeling heavy in my abdomen etc for hours on end



- Always had issues (rarely normal, always a mess, diarrhea/sticky/""mushy"", recurring hemorroids that quickly go away 1h or 2 after going number 2) with my GI health, but attributed it to my trash lifestyle. Worsened : excessive farts, very smelly farts, watery farts, waking up with skidmarks in my underwear, cramps and bloating, etc. Never been a morning eater (in general we're not in the family)



- Lost about 6-8 kg in 2 months but it makes sense since I stopped eating fast food, drinking sugary drinks and exercise regularly. It was still a surprise to me though cause I thought I was eating a lot. 



- After basic tests to exclude something life threatening, I was put on the IBS category and told to try low fodmap. 



In general I feel lots of fatigue (like the fatigue is covered up by the stimulant, but I can still feel it underneath), weak, I more often than usual can't find some words. Wake up almost every night once or twice for almost a year now to eat and/or pee.

What I'm basically getting from the medical system is : it's anxiety + IBS, your meds don't have this as a side-effect (and won't suddenly have this side-effect) and your tests are normal. Idk what to do anymore. This is becoming very debilitating. If it's not the meds, what could be causing this ? 

Low fodmap is helping with some GI issues, but I have a feeling it's helping a little cause I eat less and as I'm getting more confortable with the diet, I'm eating more (still well within normal portions) and feeling the crashes again. The skidmarks persist. Less farts though, stool seems to be doing a little better. It's a mixed bag.

“Endometriosis occurs when cells similar to those in the lining of the womb grow in other parts of the body. It affects one in 10 women of reproductive age in the UK.

However, there is very little research into the causes of the disease or how to treat it – beyond surgery, which is often only a short-term fix, or managing symptoms through hormonal contraceptives like the pill, which many women dislike because of side effects. It takes an average of almost seven years for women to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis due to lack of awareness about the disease.”",3,1743849780.0,endometriosis,1,1.0,False

During corona lockdowns I plunged in the espresso hobby (like many). Bought myself a Bambino and messed around. I couldn’t figure out the right taste and ended up concluding that I just didn’t like espresso lol. So I moved forward with superautomatic to go back to coffee, and bought a Gaggia Magenta. 

Now during the espresso hobby times I also bought an Aeropress and a Kalita 185 (with a Fellow Ode grinder). Both giving me great cups every time I use them. Which proves to me my conclusion that regular coffee is my way to go. 

My Gaggia Magenta has served me around 2000 coffees, yet I’m missing something. Only with grind setting 4,5 (very coarse) and 90ml of water I get good enough coffee. But I want bigger cups. Grinding finer results in dusty coffee. Adding more water results in diluted tasting coffee. The Coffee Compass (https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-coffee-compass/) tells me to add more coffee, but it’s already at max (5 beans). 
Which means I am left with a mini cup (‘haags bakkie’ in Dutch) of coffee using only 90ml of water and no way to ramp the volume up keeping the taste. 

So, I come to my question. Is the machine simply too focused on espresso that it won’t serve me bigger cups of my desired strong filtercoffee tasting goodness? 

Do I switch to another automatic like a Delonghi Magnifica Evo? Or will that not solve my coffee needs? 
I’d go with a Moccamaster if it wasn’t for my wifes one rule that it has to be fully automatic. 

I’m using Illy Classico beans, which give me great cups with the Kalita. ",2,1743849477.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

The machine was working fine three weeks ago before I went on holiday. This morning, excited to be back home and about to start my usual coffee routine, I removed the water tank to clean it, it had a bit of limescale, which happens from time to time. I cleaned it as I normally do.

With a clean tank filled with water, I turned on the machine, but nothing happened. Usually, you can hear the sound of the machine pulling water from the tank, but this time there’s no noise at all.

Any ideas on what might be wrong? I’ve already checked the area where the tank connects to the machine, the mechanism seems to be working fine, and water drains properly. I also opened the top of the machine to look for any clues, but haven’t found anything yet.",1,1743849249.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the defining characteristic of a 3D printed Catan set is the level of detail and customization it offers.

**Terrain Tile Detail:**⁢ 3D printed Catan sets go far beyond the flat ⁣cardboard tiles‍ of the ‍original game. Each⁣ terrain type – forests, hills, mountains, fields, pastures, and deserts – is rendered⁤ in stunning three-dimensional detail.Trees ⁢in the forest tiles are individually modeled, hills feature realistic ⁤textures, and mountains boast sharp‌ peaks. ‌The level of detail enhances the visual appeal and immerses​ players in the world of ‍Catan.

**Resource Tokens and Robber Design:** The resource ⁣tokens, also known⁣ as resource cards, are commonly substituted by⁢ customized detailed resource tokens. Instead of standard cardboard, these tokens are small works​ of art. Ore tokens might ⁢resemble miniature,​ jagged metal nuggets. Brick tokens could be sculpted as tiny, stacked bricks.‌ Sheep tokens are often adorable sheep figures. The robber also usually gets ⁣a makeover, moving away from the simple ⁣black plastic piece to more intricate and thematic ⁣sculpts, ‍such as a menacing dragon or a hooded bandit. This elevates the ⁣components to a collectible level enhancing gameplay.

**Material Quality and Durability:**‌ The quality⁣ of the filament used in 3D printing significantly impacts the ⁤set’s durability and aesthetics. High-quality PLA or ABS filaments ⁣can provide robust⁣ and long-lasting pieces, resistant to chipping, cracking, and‍ fading. Some sets ⁢even incorporate exotic filaments like‌ wood-filled PLA⁤ for a more⁣ realistic look or glow-in-the-dark filaments for a unique gaming experience. ⁣The quality⁢ and finishing techniques, such as ⁤sanding, painting, and sealing affect the components' longevity and ⁣durability on the game table.

**Board Configuration and Flexibility:** ‍Many 3D printed Catan sets offer ⁢modular designs, allowing for various⁣ board configurations beyond the standard hexagonal layout, providing ​almost infinite gameplays. Some sets include interlocking mechanisms or magnetic‍ attachments to ‌keep the tiles securely in place⁤ during gameplay.Some 3D printed Catan sets enable players to customize​ the size ⁢and shape of the ​game board, adapting to different player counts or​ spatial constraints. This enhances the⁤ flexibility and replayability of the game.

**Painting and finishing:** Pre-painted sets offer ⁣immediate visual appeal with professionally applied paints and finishes. Some sets offer unpainted variants, allowing players to customize⁤ the set to their preferences. Painting ‌a 3D printed Catan set ​can be a fun and rewarding hobby project. The painting should be done⁢ with durable paints that⁢ are able to resist chipping.

**Customization⁢ Options:** Some vendors offer personalized services,⁣ allowing customers to incorporate their names, initials, or custom designs into the set. This level of customization transforms the ⁢game into a unique and treasured possession, perfect ‍as a gift for Catan enthusiasts.

I've taught US history and Politics, I've taught international polotics and history as well and I'm wondering how I can urge attention without sounding alarmist.

This story ends one way.   History doesn't always repeat itself- but it rhymes- immitates- and follows patterns. 

There's new ingredients in our human experiment.  AI, social media, oligarchs who don't control how we travel per se, but control how the world travels through us & shape our minds. 

Never before have unelected people held so much power in this nation. Or have elected people been so in their pocket. 

Never before have our institutions been threatened by tyranny from within to such a degree. 

There are stains on our past and as a patriotuc person I must acknowledge them.  We're flawed- epically evil at times for a long time.  Too long. 

*I'm the first to admit in government waste, corruption, an unjust system, but I'm also aware that stack us up against any other modern nation and we've done our best in modern times to right wrongs not go back to them. 

Did we over compansate at times- perhaps- history will judge.   If we allow it too.
The current move to alter our nation's history is straight out of the playbook of other facists.  I can only call it when I see it.

It's not about Democrat or Republican.
It's not about liberal or conservative anymore. 
It's about those that would sell to alter or nations history to rebirth a nation in their own likeness.

Look at what's happening today and ask ourselves what will the youngest among us ask when they hear about this era?  What did you do?  

Do we allow idealic towns like Fairfield to remain silent or engage in righting wrongs. 

I look very forward to enjoying my town for years to come.   I enjoy disagreeing with and celebrating my neighbors in the most 
Patriotic and respectable ways. 

I look very forward to seeing our town, state, nation come together and say- enough.  

Please get out (you,  a sign,  or your name on a petition) and do something vs doing nothing. 

Remaining silent passively will only get you what history has shown us.   Tyranny in one form or another.

We are:

* Preheating the machine and running a ghost shot through the portafilter
* Weighing 18g of freshly roasted coffee
* Grinding into a dosing cup
* Weighing the ground coffee to check for retention
* Coffee into the portafilter, tapping to level, using a doublesided leveller/tamper (me and my partner thought this would encourage consistency when we both use machine)
* Manual preinfusion until first drops appear
* Weight output aiming for a 2:1 ratio in 30s (including preinfusion) as a starting point for dialling in
