1hlv37f,https://i.redd.it/xzu891mqrx8e1.jpeg,New Setup - Finally Ditched the Niche,"I ordered the EG-1 as an early Christmas present for myself after years of (unsuccessfully) trying to dial in the Niche where I wanted it for filter coffee. Spent a week with the Ultra burrs making great filter, but threw the Core burrs back on the other day to give espresso a shot, and wow. Way easier to dial in than I expected, and phenomenal clarity of flavor. Niche went up for sale the same day even though I had originally planned to keep it. 

My only complaint is it’s tough to move away from the Niche workflow. Hot starting is fine, but if you accidentally dump a few too many light roast beans in at once, it can definitely stall. Purge button clears it up pretty quickly though. I also miss grinding directly into portafilter a bit; the blind shaker is nice but still have to distribute grinds after using it so just adds more time to the prep.

Also definitely miss a bit of body that the Niche had, but the increased clarity is 100% worth it for me. I’ve been eyeing the EG-1 for years and couldn’t be happier having finally bit the bullet and purchased one. ",3,1735106932.0,espresso,0,0.8,False

I’m on the hunt for a coffee mug that can keep my coffee warm while preserving its taste. I currently use a Dublin mug, but I’ve noticed it gives my coffee a weird flavor (don't know the exact science but maybe it is something to do with it being made from stainless steel). I absolutely love the design and functionality of the Fellow Carter mugs, but they’re unfortunately out of my budget. Any good alternatives around ₹2000 that don’t mess with the flavor of my coffee?

Also, it probably should be noted that this is not someone who figures in my fantasies.

I have been dating my boyfriend for over two years now and his parents are pretty well off.  For my graduation from college they gifted me a very generous amount of money and then to my surprise gifted me another generous amount for Christmas.  I feel super guilty because they don’t need to gift me so much but it is very appreciated.  Anyways my boyfriend’s dad and mom are from Poland but his mom is currently in Poland so my focus for a Christmas gift is on his dad as of right now.  He likes cooking and baking but mostly Polish food and stuff he knows.  He’s proud of his culture and he works a lot and does not have much time for leisure.  He also likes coffee.  That’s the extent I know about his likes pretty much.  I’d like to spend at least $50 on him and am willing to spend more. Let me know if you have any good ideas!

Maulan pero masaya naman, I've just been singing karaoke since hindi naman ako masyadong umiinom at medyo guilty dahil napadami ang kain kasi napasarap yata luto ko sa carbonara at garlic parmesan wings. Also, we had our secret Santa and I got a fan from my brother! Hindi naman ako masyadong gala pero it will be useful if I ever go out, pero sana kasama ka na. 

Alam mo, daming nangyari nitong 2024 lang sa buhay ko. I recently got promoted to a position I really aimed for this year and achieved a few milestones in my life, running on a marathon for the first time sponsored by our company and it felt really good, Hindi ko nga alam na kaya ko palang gawin 'yun. Tapos, ang dami kong naging bagong kaibigan and I am so excited for you to meet all of them, kanal sila masyado and I lean into Aircon humor more kaya clueless din ako paano ako nagfit sa kanila but I'm really thankful I found them.

I forgot to add din na I got back into taking MMA and Judo classes again after so many years, the last class I had was on June 2018 and I stopped kasi I was preparing myself to study for college na. I started training again on November and I forgot the sensation I had when I was practicing it years before but now I remember the feeling na sobrang sakit pala sa katawan pero it's the good feeling type of pain. I could teach you some self-defense techniques that I learned.


I don't know if I said this enough but I always yearn and long for you, I want to share my success and milestones with you, celebrate life with you. I wanna run to you everytime the world is being unfair to us, I want to protect your beautiful smile those your tantalizing eyes and keep you away from the world that is ever so cruel. 

The home we'll both share would be the happiest one, no pain and cruelty will ever be welcome in our doorstep. We'll walk our fur babies every morning after I made you our breakfast, you always makes requests but I'm no stranger to that so I make whatever you are craving for, you take a sip of your coffee while watching me whip up our breakfast, I want to drive you to work and fetch you at the end of your shift, nakakapagod 'yung araw pero I know you'll get excited if I mention we'll be having takeout for dinner, we share our dinner and talk about what happened on our day and kiss your forehead goodnight. Nakakaexcite naman ang future natin together! The mundane things we'll share would be the happiest for me as I get to share it with you, you who loves and adores me as much as I do. 

God, you are so amazing and it makes me proud of you even more. The woman that you are! I hope you know how much I adore and bedazzled by you, every step you might take my breath away if you're here. The eyes that holds up all the beauty and glory this world could ever offer is in you, the smile that would melt anyone who sees it and the beauty of you both inside and outside is something every man would desperately fight and win you over, but I'm not bothered by it because I know you belong to me as am I to you. I really am so lucky and blessed to have you. Sobrang ganda mo talaga!

Maglalagay na ko ng baby powder para ma-baby mo na ko pagkatok mo sa pinto ng buhay ko tsaka magpapabango rin ako ng vanilla-based perfume para Marami akong halik na makuha sa'yo pagpasok mo at sana dito ka na lang sa tabi ko, handa na kong alagaan at mahalin ka kaya sana sa susunod na pasko, nandito ka na kasi I know that the best feeling in the world would be in between your arms, the best sensation would be your lips placed unto mine brought by my best girl in this world!

The small town of Senoi, Iowa, basked in the golden glow of a bright day. The picturesque church stood tall, its steeple stretching for the heavens. Inside, rows of pews were filled with smiling faces and whispered excitement. At the altar stood TJ, his grin crooked with sardonic charm, dressed in a slightly wrinkled suit that he had argued ""added character."" Across from him, Lily, radiant and seemingly perfect, glowed with happiness as she spoke her vows with a voice trembling with sincerity.

""I promise to love you, TJ, with all that I am. To stand by your side through all of life’s challenges. You gave me hope when I had none, and I vow to return that light to you every day of our lives,"" she said, her words steeped in earnest emotion. Her hands trembled slightly as she held his, her gaze unwavering.

TJ shifted slightly, his discomfort with such raw sentiment barely concealed. A grin tugged at his lips as he leaned forward, muttering just loud enough for Lily to hear, ""Is it too late to switch to 'I promise not to nag?'""

Lily’s soft laugh broke the tension, and she shook her head at him, her cheeks flushing. The crowd chuckled lightly at TJ’s antics, their warmth evident in the murmurs of approval. The priest concluded his blessing with a solemn yet joyful tone. ""You may now kiss the bride.""

As TJ leaned in to kiss Lily, the applause rose to a crescendo. Yet, as their lips met, TJ felt an odd ripple in the air—as though something unseen brushed against him. The room darkened briefly, as if a cloud had passed overhead. He instinctively pulled back, his brows furrowing as he glanced toward the crowd, though everyone else seemed oblivious.

""Cool,"" TJ muttered under his breath as they turned to face the crowd. ""Haunted vows.""

Lily gave his hand a squeeze, her thumb brushing against his palm in a reassuring gesture. ""You’re not funny.""

""Sure I am,"" TJ replied, masking the slight chill running down his spine with humor. ""That’s why you married me.""

The churchyard was alive with celebration as the newlyweds stepped into the sunlight. Folding tables decorated with flowers and lace held trays of hors d’oeuvres, glasses of sparkling cider, and a tiered wedding cake that Lily had insisted on baking herself. Guests mingled beneath strings of fairy lights, the soft hum of laughter and conversation weaving through the air. Children darted between the adults, their giggles blending into the distant chirping of birds.

TJ found himself cornered by his best friend, Mike, who held a paper plate stacked with finger sandwiches and cheese cubes. ""You actually went through with it,"" Mike said, shaking his head with mock disbelief. ""I half-expected you to fake a heart attack at the altar.""

""I considered it,"" TJ replied, plucking a cube of cheddar from Mike’s plate. ""But I figured, why ruin Lily’s big day? She’s already locked into the poor life choice of marrying me.""

""Poor life choice? You’re a catch,"" Mike said, smirking. ""A slightly damaged catch with questionable fashion sense, but a catch nonetheless.""

TJ snorted. ""Thanks, man. I’ll make sure that’s engraved on my tombstone.""

The two men stood in companionable silence for a moment, watching the crowd. Lily moved gracefully through the throng of guests, her laughter ringing out as she hugged family members and old friends. She looked radiant, her white dress catching the golden hues of the late afternoon sun.

""She looks happy,"" Mike said softly, nudging TJ with his elbow. ""You did good, man.""

TJ’s grin faltered slightly as he watched her. ""Yeah,"" he said after a pause. ""She does.""

Mike studied him, his brow furrowing. ""What’s that tone? You’re happy, right?""

TJ forced a smile, running a hand through his hair. ""Of course. Happiest I’ve ever been.""

As the evening progressed, the celebration showed no signs of slowing. Lily’s father, a jovial man with a booming laugh, raised a toast to the couple. ""To TJ and Lily,"" he declared, holding his glass aloft. ""May your life together be as sweet as this cake, as strong as this cider, and as unforgettable as this day.""

The crowd erupted into cheers, and TJ lifted his glass with a lopsided grin. But as he sipped, his eyes drifted toward the tall church windows. The reflection of the string lights shimmered in the glass, casting strange shapes that seemed to shift and writhe.

""Everything okay?"" Lily asked, appearing at his side.

TJ blinked, tearing his gaze away from the windows. ""Yeah. Just tired. Big day and all.""

She smiled, brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. ""It’s the start of forever,"" she said softly. ""And it’s perfect.""

As the last of the guests departed, the churchyard grew quiet. TJ and Lily walked hand in hand back toward the church to collect their belongings. The warm glow of the day had faded into twilight, the air now cool and still.

""It really was a perfect day,"" Lily said, her voice dreamy. ""Don’t you think?""

""Perfect,"" TJ echoed, though a faint unease gnawed at the back of his mind. He glanced over his shoulder at the darkened windows of the church. For a brief moment, he thought he saw movement—a shadow flitting across the glass. He froze, his grip on Lily’s hand tightening.

""Something wrong?"" she asked, turning to follow his gaze.

He shook his head quickly. ""No. Just... this day’s been a lot.""

She smiled, leaning her head against his shoulder. ""Let’s go home,"" she said. ""Our forever starts now.""



PART 2: HOME

The newlyweds moved into their farmhouse later that afternoon. The building was imposing, with an aged charm that hinted at decades of stories it kept locked within its walls. Surrounding the property were endless fields, their golden hues stark against the vivid blue sky. The cicadas hummed incessantly, a background noise that seemed to amplify the oppressive quiet of the house.

""This place has potential,"" TJ said, struggling to lift a heavy box through the threshold. ""Just needs... a little work. You know, duct tape here, maybe a séance there. The usual.""

""It’s perfect,"" Lily said with a smile, her voice warm with optimism. She set a smaller box down on the dusty floor. ""A fresh start.""

The interior of the farmhouse was as charming as it was eerie. High ceilings with exposed wooden beams cast long shadows as the evening sun filtered through the windows. The air inside was stale, carrying the faint scent of old wood and disuse.

As they began unpacking, TJ noticed subtle oddities in the house. A draft brushed past him in the hallway, though no windows were open. The wooden floor creaked beneath his feet, and he swore he heard faint whispers when he stood still for too long.

""Did you hear that?"" he asked Lily as they worked together in the kitchen.

""Hear what?"" she replied, her tone dismissive.

""Nothing. Probably just the house settling."" TJ forced a laugh, but his unease lingered.

They explored the rest of the house, room by room. Each space told a story of neglect and abandonment. The furniture left behind by the previous owners was covered in dust, and the walls bore faint marks of water damage. One room, however, caught TJ’s attention. It was a small, windowless space at the end of the hallway. The door was locked.

""That’s weird,"" TJ said, jiggling the doorknob. ""Why would someone lock a room in their own house?""

""Maybe they kept something valuable in there,"" Lily suggested, already losing interest.

""Or maybe it’s where they kept their haunted dolls,"" TJ muttered, peering through the keyhole. The darkness inside offered no answers.

""Come on,"" Lily called from the living room. ""We have plenty of unpacking to do.""

Reluctantly, TJ left the locked door behind, but the thought of what lay inside gnawed at him. The first night in the farmhouse was anything but restful. TJ lay awake, staring at the ceiling as the sounds of the house seemed to grow louder in the darkness. The creaks of the floorboards, the faint rustling in the walls, and the low hum of the cicadas outside formed a cacophony that refused to be ignored.

Beside him, Lily slept peacefully, her breathing soft and even. TJ envied her ability to drift off so easily. Just as he began to close his eyes, a faint whisper reached his ears.

""TJ...""

He bolted upright, his heart pounding. The room was still. He glanced around, his eyes darting to every corner. ""Lily? Did you say something?""

She stirred slightly but didn’t wake. Swallowing hard, TJ swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood. The wooden floor was cold against his feet as he made his way to the hallway. The whisper came again, faint but distinct.

""TJ...""

He followed the sound to the locked door at the end of the hall. The air around it felt colder, and a faint draft seemed to seep through the cracks. He pressed his ear to the door, his breath shallow.

Nothing.

Shaking his head, TJ returned to bed, but sleep didn’t come easily. The whispers stayed with him, lingering in the back of his mind. The following day, TJ decided to investigate the history of the house. He visited the local library, hoping to find answers. The librarian, a kind but reserved woman named Mrs. Adler, listened attentively as TJ explained his interest.

""This house has been around for decades,"" Mrs. Adler said, pulling out a thick binder of records. ""It’s seen its fair share of owners. Some stayed longer than others.""

TJ flipped through the pages, his unease growing as he read about the house’s past. Stories of unexplained disappearances, tragic accidents, and whispers of hauntings filled the records. One photograph caught his eye: the farmhouse as it appeared fifty years ago. A shadowy figure stood in the doorway, its features obscured.

""That’s... unsettling,"" TJ muttered.

Mrs. Adler gave him a pointed look. ""If you want my advice, you’ll leave that house. Some places are better left alone.""

TJ left the library with more questions than answers. As he drove back to the farmhouse, the sense of unease deepened. Something about the house didn’t feel right, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched. Back at the house, Lily greeted him with a smile. ""How was your trip to town?""

""Informative,"" TJ said, forcing a smile. ""This place has a... colorful history.""

""Don’t overthink it,"" Lily said, wrapping her arms around him. ""It’s just a house.""

But TJ wasn’t convinced. That night, as he lay awake once more, the whispers returned. And this time, they sounded closer.

The third day in the farmhouse brought more strange occurrences. TJ found a pile of dead flies on the windowsill in the living room, their tiny bodies forming an unsettling pattern. When he mentioned it to Lily, she shrugged. ""It’s an old house. Probably nothing.""

But TJ wasn’t so sure. He couldn’t ignore the faint scratch marks that appeared on the walls in the hallway, or the way the air seemed heavier near the locked room. Desperate for answers, he called his friend Mike.

""Mike, you’ve got to come see this place,"" TJ said over the phone. ""Something’s... off.""

""Off how?"" Mike asked, his tone skeptical.

""It’s hard to explain. But I feel like... like I’m not alone here.""

""TJ, it’s an old farmhouse. They creak, they groan. It’s probably nothing.""

But even as Mike dismissed his concerns, TJ couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was watching him. That night, TJ awoke to the sound of footsteps. He sat up in bed, his heart racing. The sound was faint but deliberate, like someone pacing in the hallway. He glanced at Lily, who was still fast asleep.

Grabbing a flashlight, TJ crept out of the bedroom and into the hallway. The footsteps stopped abruptly, leaving an eerie silence in their wake. TJ shone the flashlight down the corridor, the beam illuminating the locked door at the end.

The doorknob rattled. TJ froze, his breath caught in his throat. For a moment, he considered waking Lily, but something told him she wouldn’t hear what he was hearing. Summoning his courage, he approached the door. The rattling stopped as he drew near.

""Who’s there?"" TJ whispered, his voice barely audible.

There was no answer. He reached out and touched the doorknob. It was ice cold. That night, he couldn’t sleep. Something was in the house, and it wasn’t leaving. The following morning, TJ decided he needed to get into the locked room. He rummaged through the garage, searching for tools, and eventually found an old crowbar. With Lily busy tending to the garden, TJ returned to the hallway and wedged the crowbar into the doorframe.

The door groaned in protest before finally giving way. The room beyond was dark and stifling, the air thick with dust. TJ stepped inside, his flashlight cutting through the gloom. The walls were lined with shelves, each one filled with old books, jars of strange substances, and faded photographs.

In the center of the room sat a table. On it was a leather-bound journal and a small box. TJ opened the box first, revealing a collection of trinkets—rings, necklaces, and coins—all inscribed with the same symbol as the medallion he had found. He turned his attention to the journal. The pages were brittle, but the handwriting was clear. It belonged to a man named Elias Harper, who had lived in the house over a century ago. The entries grew darker as TJ read on, detailing Elias’s descent into paranoia and fear.

""The whispers grow louder each night,"" one entry read. ""She watches me, even when she’s not there.""

The final entry sent a chill down TJ’s spine: ""I’ve sealed the room, but it won’t stop her. Nothing will."" TJ left the room in a daze, clutching the journal. As he stepped into the hallway, he felt the air shift, colder than before. The faint sound of laughter echoed from somewhere deep within the house.

""Lily?"" he called out, but there was no response. His grip tightened on the journal as a shadow darted across the far wall. For the first time since moving in, TJ realized he wasn’t just imagining things. Something was here, and it was watching. His heart raced as the laughter echoed again, this time louder, as if mocking his every move. He turned sharply, the journal slipping from his grasp and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Shadows seemed to ripple along the walls, converging and dispersing like living things.

The cold silence that followed was suffocating. TJ backed away from the locked room, shutting the door behind him, but he knew it wouldn’t stop whatever was lurking in the house. Clutching the journal to his chest, he resolved to uncover the truth, no matter the cost. As he stepped into the living room, Lily appeared at the edge of the hallway, her expression calm yet unreadable. ""Find anything interesting?"" she asked, her voice carrying an unsettling undertone. TJ hesitated before answering. ""Yeah,"" he replied, his voice steady but his eyes fixed on hers. ""Just some old things."" But deep down, he knew this was just the beginning of a far darker mystery.



PART 3: DISCORVERY

The farmhouse stood silent, shrouded in an unnatural stillness, as TJ sat in the living room clutching the leather-bound journal he had found. The air felt heavy, charged with a tension he couldn’t name. Across the room, Lily hummed softly, busying herself with tidying up the kitchen. Her calm demeanor only amplified TJ’s unease.

He flipped through the brittle pages again, his eyes skimming over the erratic scrawls of Elias Harper, a man who had lived in the house over a century ago. Elias wrote of strange occurrences, whispers in the dark, and a figure he could never quite see but always felt watching him.

""What’s that?"" Lily’s voice broke through TJ’s thoughts. He startled, slamming the journal shut.

""Just... some old junk I found,"" he said, slipping the book behind him. ""Figured it might be interesting.""

Lily tilted her head, her expression unreadable. ""You’ve been acting strange since we moved in.""

TJ forced a smile. ""It’s the house. You know me—big city guy stuck in a creaky old farmhouse. I’m probably just imagining things.""

She stared at him for a moment longer before turning back to the sink. TJ exhaled, relief mingling with the gnawing sense that she didn’t entirely believe him.

The next morning, TJ returned to the local library. Mrs. Adler greeted him with a knowing look as he approached her desk.

""Back again?"" she asked, her tone laced with curiosity.

""Yeah,"" TJ said, placing the journal on the counter. ""This belonged to someone who used to live in the house. Elias Harper. Do you know anything about him?""

Mrs. Adler’s eyes widened as she examined the journal. ""Elias Harper,"" she murmured. ""He was one of the first owners. The stories about him... well, they’re not for the faint of heart.""

TJ leaned in. ""What kind of stories?""

Mrs. Adler hesitated, then gestured for him to follow her to a back room. The dimly lit space smelled of old paper and mildew. She pulled a dusty file from a cabinet and spread its contents on a nearby table. Newspaper clippings, faded photographs, and handwritten notes painted a grim picture.

""Elias Harper was a farmer,"" Mrs. Adler began. ""He moved here with his wife, Lillian. At first, everything seemed fine, but after a few years, neighbors noticed he had become reclusive. He stopped attending church, rarely came to town. Then his wife disappeared.""

""Disappeared?"" TJ asked, his pulse quickening.

Mrs. Adler nodded. ""He claimed she left him, but no one ever saw her again. Shortly after, Elias started talking about... things in the house. Whispers, shadows. People thought he was losing his mind.""

TJ flipped through the clippings, stopping at one with a photograph of Elias standing in front of the farmhouse. Beside him was a woman with piercing eyes and a serene smile. ""Is this Lillian?""

Mrs. Adler glanced at the photo and nodded. ""That’s her.""

TJ’s chest tightened. The resemblance to Lily was uncanny.

That night, TJ couldn’t sleep. The journal sat on the nightstand, its presence a reminder of the questions he couldn’t shake. Beside him, Lily slept soundly, her breathing soft and even. TJ envied her serenity.

Around midnight, the whispers began again.

""TJ...""

He bolted upright, his heart pounding. The room was dark, the only light coming from the faint glow of the moon through the curtains. He scanned the room, but nothing seemed out of place.

""TJ...""

The sound was closer this time, almost as if it were inside the room. Swallowing hard, TJ grabbed the flashlight from his nightstand and crept out of bed. He followed the sound to the hallway, his steps slow and deliberate. The locked room at the end of the hall seemed to hum with an energy he couldn’t explain.

As he approached, the whispers stopped. The air grew colder, and a shadow darted across the crack beneath the door. TJ froze, his breath hitching. Summoning his courage, he reached for the doorknob. It didn’t rattle this time, but it was colder than ice.

""What’s in there?"" he whispered to himself.

The silence that followed was deafening.

The following day, TJ called Mike. ""You need to come over,"" he said, his voice tense.

""TJ, what’s going on?"" Mike asked, concern lacing his tone.

""I can’t explain it over the phone. Just... please. I need someone to see this place.""

Mike hesitated but eventually agreed. ""I’ll be there tomorrow.""

Feeling a small measure of relief, TJ decided to spend the day digging deeper into Elias Harper’s life. He returned to the attic, where he had first found the journal. Among the boxes of old belongings, he discovered more photographs and letters. One letter, written in shaky handwriting, caught his attention.

""To whoever finds this,"" it began, ""you must leave this house. She is not what she seems. She will not let you go.""

The letter ended abruptly, the ink smeared as if the writer had been interrupted. TJ’s hands trembled as he placed the letter back in the box. He had hoped for answers, but all he found were more questions.

When Mike arrived the next morning, TJ wasted no time showing him the journal, the photographs, and the letter. Mike listened intently, his usual skepticism replaced by genuine concern.

""This is... a lot,"" Mike admitted. ""But are you sure you’re not just overthinking things? Old houses are creepy. They make noises.""

TJ shook his head. ""It’s not just the noises. It’s the whispers, the locked room, the way Lily’s been acting.""

""What do you mean?""

""She’s... different,"" TJ said. ""She shrugs everything off like it’s nothing, but sometimes I catch her staring at me, like she’s waiting for something.""

Mike frowned. ""Have you talked to her about this?""

""She won’t listen,"" TJ said, his frustration boiling over. ""She loves this house. She thinks I’m being paranoid.""

Mike placed a hand on TJ’s shoulder. ""Alright. Let’s take a look at this locked room.""

The two men stood in front of the door, the crowbar TJ had used to break it open resting against the wall. The room beyond was as TJ had left it—dusty, cluttered, and filled with relics of the past.

""This is it,"" TJ said, gesturing to the shelves and the table. ""This is where I found the journal.""

Mike walked around the room, his eyes scanning the shelves. ""These symbols,"" he said, pointing to the trinkets, ""they look familiar.""

""Familiar how?"" TJ asked.

Mike hesitated. ""I’ve seen them in books about folklore. They’re usually associated with protection or curses.""

TJ’s stomach sank. ""So which is it? Protection or curse?""

""I don’t know,"" Mike admitted. ""But whatever it is, it’s not good.""

As they spoke, the temperature in the room dropped sharply. The shadows on the walls seemed to stretch and writhe, forming shapes that made TJ’s blood run cold.

""We need to leave,"" Mike said, his voice barely above a whisper.

TJ nodded, but as they turned to go, the door slammed shut. The sound reverberated through the room, shaking the shelves and sending a jar crashing to the floor. The two men froze, their breaths visible in the frigid air.

""Did you see that?"" TJ whispered.

Mike nodded, his face pale. ""We’re not alone.""

When they finally managed to leave the room, TJ and Mike sat in the living room, their nerves frayed. Lily entered, her expression calm yet curious.

""What’s going on?"" she asked, her gaze flicking between the two men.

""Nothing,"" TJ said quickly. ""Just catching up.""

Lily raised an eyebrow but said nothing. As she walked away, Mike leaned closer to TJ. ""You need to get out of here,"" he said. ""This house isn’t safe.""

""I can’t,"" TJ said. ""Not without Lily.""

Mike sighed. ""Then you need to figure out what’s really going on. Before it’s too late.""

That night, TJ sat alone in the living room, the journal open on his lap. The words of Elias Harper echoed in his mind: ""She is not what she seems. She will not let you go.""

The faint sound of laughter drifted through the house, its tone cold and mocking. It seemed to echo from every corner, growing louder with each passing second. TJ snapped the journal shut, his hands trembling, as he forced himself to stand. This house wasn’t just haunted by memories—it was alive, and it wanted something from him.

As the laughter faded into an oppressive silence, TJ turned to the hallway. Shadows flickered unnaturally, and he could feel the house watching, waiting. Clutching the journal tightly, he resolved to find out what had happened to Elias Harper and his wife, Lillian. But more than that, he needed to uncover the truth about Lily. As her voice called softly from the kitchen, ""TJ? Are you alright?"" he hesitated, his heart pounding. He wasn’t sure anymore if she was his salvation or part of the darkness threatening to consume him.



PART 4: REVEALATION

TJ didn’t sleep the night after his discovery. The journal's frantic scrawls and the cryptic letter haunted his thoughts, their implications burrowing into his mind like splinters. The words ""She is not what she seems"" replayed over and over as he sat at the kitchen table, staring at the medallion and the photograph of Elias Harper and Lillian. The resemblance between Lillian and Lily was undeniable, a puzzle piece that didn’t fit but couldn’t be ignored.

By morning, TJ had resolved to take Mrs. Adler’s advice and seek out Professor Lewis in Cedar Rapids. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was running out of time, and the house’s oppressive atmosphere seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. Lily didn’t question his sudden need to leave, simply kissing him goodbye as he climbed into the car. Her calm acceptance unnerved him. It was as if she already knew where he was going.

Professor Lewis’s office was exactly what TJ expected: cluttered, dimly lit, and filled with the smell of aged paper and incense. The professor himself was a wiry man with silver-rimmed glasses and an intense gaze that seemed to see straight through TJ.

""You must be Mr. Carver,"" Lewis said, gesturing for him to sit. ""Mrs. Adler called ahead. She said you have something unusual.""

TJ placed the journal, the medallion, and the photograph on the desk. ""I need to know what these mean,"" he said, his voice tight with urgency.

Lewis studied the items in silence, his brow furrowing as he flipped through the journal. When he reached the final entry, he set the book down and adjusted his glasses. ""This is... troubling.""

""No kidding,"" TJ muttered. ""Who was Elias Harper? And why does his wife look exactly like mine?""

Lewis leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. ""Elias Harper was a farmer, yes, but also a recluse in his later years. The stories about him are grim. Whispers of madness, occult practices, and a wife who vanished under mysterious circumstances. But what you’re dealing with..."" He tapped the medallion. ""This symbol is ancient, tied to folklore about Lilith.""

""Lilith?"" TJ repeated, the name unfamiliar.

""The first wife of Adam,"" Lewis explained. ""A demon cast out of Eden, said to prey on men and children. In some stories, she’s described as a seductress, in others, as a vengeful spirit. Always, though, she’s eternal.""

TJ’s stomach turned. ""Are you saying Lily is... what? Possessed? A reincarnation?""

Lewis hesitated. ""I’m saying she may not be what she seems. If this house has drawn her here, it’s not by coincidence. Lilith thrives on despair, on those who cling to their grief.""

""That’s insane,"" TJ said, though the words rang hollow. He thought of Lily’s distant stares, her eerie calm, and the way the house seemed to bend around her presence.

""You came to me for answers,"" Lewis said sharply. ""If you want my advice, leave. Burn the house if you must, but do not stay.""

TJ sat in stunned silence. ""And Lily?""

Lewis’s gaze softened. ""If she’s tied to this, then she won’t leave willingly.""

The drive back to the farmhouse was suffocating. Every mile felt heavier, the weight of the professor’s words pressing down on TJ’s chest. By the time he pulled into the driveway, the sun had dipped below the horizon, and the house loomed in shadow, its windows dark and unwelcoming.

Lily greeted him at the door with her usual smile. ""How was your trip?""

""Informative,"" TJ said, forcing a neutral tone. ""I found some things that might help.""

She tilted her head, studying him. ""You’ve been so tense lately. Why don’t we sit down, have some tea?""

""Maybe later,"" TJ said, brushing past her. He needed time to think, to figure out his next move. But as he climbed the stairs to their bedroom, he felt her gaze lingering on his back, heavier than ever.

That night, TJ didn’t dare sleep. He sat in the living room, the medallion clutched in one hand and the journal open on the coffee table. The shadows seemed to stretch and crawl along the walls, and the whispers were louder than ever, an incessant chorus that gnawed at his sanity.

""Why are you here?"" he muttered under his breath. ""What do you want?""

The room answered with silence, but a faint laugh echoed from the hallway. TJ stood, his muscles taut, and turned toward the sound. The hallway was empty, but the door to the locked room was ajar.

He approached cautiously, the medallion feeling heavier in his hand. Pushing the door open, he found the room exactly as he had left it—dusty shelves, jars of strange substances, and the table with the small box. But this time, there was something else. In the center of the room, a faint figure flickered, its form hazy and indistinct.

""Lillian?"" TJ whispered, his voice trembling.

The figure didn’t respond, but its head tilted slightly, as if acknowledging him. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished, leaving only the oppressive silence behind.

The next morning, TJ confronted Lily. He waited until they were seated at the kitchen table, the journal and medallion between them.

""We need to talk,"" he said, his voice firm.

Lily looked up from her tea, her expression calm. ""About what?""

""About the house. About you,"" TJ said. ""This isn’t normal, Lily. The whispers, the locked room, the things I’ve found. And then there’s this."" He pointed to the photograph of Lillian.

She studied the image for a long moment before meeting his gaze. ""You think I’m her?""

""I don’t know what to think,"" TJ admitted. ""But something is wrong here, and I need you to be honest with me.""

Lily sighed, setting her cup down. ""TJ, I love you, but you’ve been spiraling since we moved here. Maybe this house isn’t the problem. Maybe it’s you.""

Her words stung, but TJ refused to back down. ""I’m not imagining this. I spoke to a professor who said—""

""A professor?"" Lily interrupted, her voice rising. ""You’ve been running around talking to strangers about our lives instead of coming to me?""

TJ slammed his hand on the table, the medallion clinking against the wood. ""Because I don’t know if I can trust you!""

The silence that followed was deafening. Lily’s expression hardened, her serene facade cracking. Without a word, she stood and walked out of the room, leaving TJ alone with his doubts.

That evening, TJ received a text from Mike: ""Call me when you can. Found something you’ll want to see.""

He dialed immediately, his heart pounding. ""What is it?""

""I was digging through some old archives,"" Mike said. ""There are more stories about your house. It’s not just Elias and Lillian. There’s a pattern. Every couple that’s lived there—something’s happened to them. Disappearances, deaths, madness.""

TJ’s grip tightened on the phone. ""And the wives?""

""Always the same description,"" Mike said. ""Dark hair, pale skin, piercing eyes. TJ... it’s Lily.""

The call ended abruptly as the lights in the house flickered. TJ turned slowly, the phone slipping from his grasp. Lily stood in the doorway, her silhouette framed by the dim light.

""Who were you talking to?"" she asked, her voice low.

""No one,"" TJ lied, his pulse racing. ""Just a work call.""

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. ""You’ve been so distracted lately. You should rest.""

As she left, TJ sank into a chair, his mind racing. He couldn’t stay here, but he couldn’t leave without answers.

That night, TJ packed a bag. He didn’t know where he would go, but he needed to get out. As he descended the stairs, the whispers returned, louder than ever. They seemed to come from all around him, overlapping and incomprehensible.

When he reached the front door, Lily was waiting for him. Her calm smile sent a chill down his spine.

""Going somewhere?"" she asked.

""I need some air,"" TJ said, his voice shaking.

She stepped closer, her eyes locking onto his. ""You’re not leaving, TJ. Not yet.""

For the first time, TJ saw something in her gaze that wasn’t human. He took a step back, his hand tightening around the medallion. ""What are you?""

Her smile widened. ""You’ll find out soon enough.""

The house seemed to come alive around him, the walls groaning and the shadows growing darker. As TJ bolted for the back door, Lily’s laughter echoed behind him, cold and mocking. He didn’t stop running until he was in the middle of the field, the farmhouse a dark silhouette against the night sky.

He clutched the medallion to his chest, his breath ragged. He wasn’t safe, not yet. But he knew one thing for certain—he had to end this. Whatever Lily was, whatever the house wanted, he wouldn’t let it take him.",1,1735105829.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

“I… I need to go.” I moved to stand, but Anna clung tighter to me.

“Please don’t go.” Her voice was small and soft, making my brain war with my heart on just what action to take.

I reached down and gently took her small hand in mine. “Anna, please,” I whispered, my throat tight.

I felt her fingers dig into my belly painfully as she shook her head against my back. I could feel my shirt growing damp where her face rested against my warming body. “No, Jack. Please stay,” she sniffled.

I closed my eyes and tilted my head back, struggling to force my breathing to be even. It was a losing battle that I valiantly fought to the end. Eventually, I opened my eyes to the ceiling, feeling the scalding tears course down my cheeks, blurring my vision. “Why? Why couldn’t they all just leave me alone?” I whispered to the air.

As if on cue by a sadistic ringmaster, my memory assaulted me with the faces of those I’d killed. From Marge to the many nameless faces I’d killed just to stay alive while I was homeless and wandering, all the way back to just a few days after graduation. Michael Algoode. A kid with an equally useless power at the time. All he could do was change the color of something. From whatever to whatever.

See, by the end of school, I’d already found that my doors could breach walls and buildings. A somewhat useful ability, but one that was overshadowed by so many others. But not to Michael. He was jealous; and like most jealous kids, he wanted what he couldn’t have. But, as everyone knows, abilities can’t be given or traded. So, he opted for the second approach.

If *he* couldn’t have it, *nobody* could.

He cornered me late one evening outside near the slums. I’d gone for a walk to clear my head after panhandling on a corner, heading to a defunct warehouse near the docks that I had been using for shelter.

“Well, if it isn’t the *doormat*. What’s wrong, *Doormat*? Parents don’t love you? Nobody there to take a loser like you in?” He snickered, thinking he was clever.

“Come *on,* Mike. I just wanna go to sleep, man. Can you leave off for the evening?” I remember shifting to my left, trying to keep him in the streetlight.

“You wanna sleep, loser? You don’t deserve that power, you know. Maybe I should let you *sleep* for good. Let that power go to someone who doesn’t *suck* at everything.” A knife slipped into his left hand. It glinted in the streetlight.

“Dammit, Mike. Leave me alone.” I held my hands up and started to back away, knowing that I could *never* outrun him. He had been one of our top sprinters.

“You know you’ll never get out of here alive, don’t you? And your lame ass can’t even fight *back*. Good thing nobody’ll miss you.” He swiped at my eyes a couple of times in quick succession.

I couldn’t help myself. I turned and ran. I could hear him laughing at me as he chased me, felt my shirt get sliced into ribbons with him just a hairsbreadth from doing me any *serious* harm. Every so often I felt a hot lance of pain swipe across my back as the tip of his knife scored my tender flesh. Just enough to spur me on.

Eventually I got winded, and tripped over a curb, sliding face first across the concrete. Mike kicked me in the side until I turned onto my back. I saw him brandishing the knife in a duelist's grip, a bloodthirsty grin on his face.

It was the last time he *ever* smiled. It was also the first time I found out I could create a door not just on a building, but *on a person*.

A small door appeared on his shoulders, bisecting his head from his body. I saw his eyes roll back in his head as he fell, the door crashing open, arterial blood spurting across the cars and the street. I vomited next to his still-warm corpse in horror. *What had I* ***done****?*

Knowing I’d be suspected if it were found, I dissolved my door, and took the knife from his twitching hand. It now rests in a *very* secure and special place that I try to never visit.

I ran all the way to my hiding spot near the docks, the image of Michael’s headless corpse forever burned into my brain. I opened a door in the side of the building and darted inside, tears streaming down my face. I dropped the knife just inside the building, and collapsed into a sobbing mess.

I couldn’t bring myself to leave the warehouse for days, certain the police were *just* outside, waiting to pick me up. I’d just killed a man. Sure, I’d done it out of desperation, to preserve my own life. Certainly it could be justified. My shredded shirt and scored flesh were proof enough of the intent behind Michael’s murderous rage. It still didn’t sit well with me then, though. I’d *killed someone*. Only bad people did that. I wasn’t a bad person, was I? *Was I?*

I didn’t know then, and I still didn’t know *now*. The string of bodies I’d left in my wake was proof enough that I had a screw loose. Right? Yesterday, I’d have said yes.

Now, though? I wasn’t so sure.

I slowly brought myself under control over many long minutes, with Anna clinging to me in her death grip. I heard Bethany’s chair slide across the floor and a few moments later, an ice pack was draped across my face. I heard the subtle creaking of wood as Bethany reassumed her seat, then her chair scooted some more and I felt her cold hands take mine and place them on the ice pack.

“Take your time, Jackson. We aren’t going anywhere, and if my little Anna has anything to say about it, *neither are you*.”

I felt my midsection quiver as my surroundings slammed back into me, realization of what was happening finally entering my awareness. Anna, her tiny, sensitive hands gently caressing my roiling muscles still sat behind me, my anchor to the here and now.

I pressed the ice pack into my face, willing it to leech the excess warmth from me. I felt raw, weak and most of all, I felt *exhausted*. I sat that way, face tilted to the ceiling, until I felt that my breathing had become more regular and even, and only then did I let my neck relax, even as my breath hitched once or twice. I shifted, gently displacing Anna, and planted my elbows onto the table and rested that way, my face buried in my hands, for a few minutes more.

Anna refused to leave me be, and forced her way into my lap, where she sat, her head resting on my shoulder, as mine slowly buried its way into her neck. She was gently rubbing my back as tears silently rolled their way down my cheeks. After a few minutes, I slowly sat up straight, looking at her sad face. She reached up and carefully wiped a few stray tears from my cheeks with her thumbs.

“Hi Jack. Welcome back. Beth’s right. I’m not going anywhere and neither are you. No more running. No more hiding. Okay, honey?”

I nodded, sniffling. “Yeah. Okay.”

“She’s right, Jackson. I’m… I’m sorry to have brought this up and ruined dinner.”

In response, I held out my arm, and motioned her closer. Once she was in range, I swept her into a gentle hug. “Thanks Bethany. You… You didn’t ruin dinner. My past did.” I directed my gaze to Anna. “I hope you understand better now just what you’re getting into, Anna. I’m *broken*. I’ve done terrible things in my past, and I’m not the most stable of people, nor am I one of the *good ones*.”

Anna took my cheeks in her hands and planted a soft kiss on my lips. “You’re good enough for *me*, Jack. Remember that, okay? Even if you don’t feel like you’re good, remember that *I* think you’re good enough for me.”

“Yeah. You’re not so bad, Gigantor. I see why she cares so much for you.” She gave me a gentle squeeze.

I sniffled once and took a deep breath. “Alright, alright. Enough with the sappy stuff, okay? I ain’t used to it, and it’s kinda making me feel weird.” I opened my arm and Bethany stepped back a bit, but kept a hand on my shoulder.

Anna leaned back, her hands locked behind my neck. “You mean I gotta move?”

A thousand and one ideas raced through my head, and I grinned. “Nah. You’re tiny.” I stood, cradling her butt with an arm, hearing her delighted giggle, as I moved my chair with the other. “Now which way is the TV again?”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“Rise and shine, Gigantor.” Bethany gently shook me awake.

I blinked several times and stretched languidly. “Hrmm? What- what’s going on?”

Anna placed a steaming mug of coffee in front of my face. I gratefully took the bitter, black, lifegiving brew, sipping it gently. “It’s about nine in the morning, Jack. You passed out on the couch, and neither of us had the heart to wake you. Besides, you looked awful cute all curled up there.” Her impish smile brought a similar one to my own face.

I sipped more of the coffee. “So… now what?”

Anna came around and sat beside me, shrugging her shoulders. “I dunno. What do you want?”

I yawned. “Well, what I *want* is breakfast. I don’t know what you ladies have here, but that’s what I want.”

Bethany smirked. “Well, I’m sure Anna has some eggs you could scramble.”

“*Oh my* ***god****, Beth!*”

I choked on the coffee, feeling scalding bean water shoot from my nostrils. Anna went crimson, hiding her face in her hands as Bethany clutched her sides, laughing loudly. It took me a few minutes to recover.

“While that would be enjoyable for *us*, I’m afraid it doesn’t answer the need for *food*,” I said, once I had recovered sufficiently.

Bethany snickered a bit more. “True. How about we go out for breakfast? My treat?”

I looked over at Anna, who shrugged. “Sure. Let’s do that. What do we think of going over to Wilhelm’s? They make a good breakfast.”

I nodded and coughed softly. Wilhelm’s was an old-style diner modeled after the German style of cooking. They did a hearty, home-cooked breakfast like you wouldn’t believe, and the flavors were simply to die for. It was a shame they were a *wee* bit expensive, or I’d have been eating there more often than the once a year treat I limited myself to. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, letting the coffee work its magic in my soul.

“Wilhelm’s? I don’t think I’ve been there before. What do they have?” Bethany asked.

I grinned in response. “Well, let me ask you a question.” Bethany cocked her head to the side. “Do you like sausages?”

“Like breakfast sausage?” She shrugged. “Sure. I like sausage just as much as anyone else, I guess. Why?”

“It’s a German style diner. Lots of bratwurst and knockwurst and eggs and potatoes. And coffee. They *love* their coffee.”

Bethany lit up like a Christmas tree. “That sounds heavenly! Let’s go.”

“Beth, honey? Don’t you think we might need, I dunno? A shower?”

Bethany scoffed and waved dismissively. “Bah. It’ll be fine, baby. Look, I don’t go out much, Gigantor, so count yourself blessed that I’m willing to take us out for breakfast.”

I grinned. “Sure thing. Uh… Is the restriction on opening doors in the gym still there? I can get us there really damn fast.”

“Sorry, big guy. I’m not gonna lift that one. That you come to the gym that way is one thing. Going elsewhere is *not* going to be okay. We’ll go the old fashioned way. By bus.”

I nodded. A little paranoid, but understandable. “How about I meet you two there? It’ll take a half hour or so to get there from here, and it would maintain a sense of normality to anyone spying. For me to just walk out of here after being ‘at home’ would be a dead giveaway to Brighthawk’s watchers.”

“Huh. I hadn’t thought of that. Probably best. Go then. We’ll see you there.”

As I opened their door to the office, Anna caught my arm. “Don’t run off now, Jack. I want to enjoy a sausage or two with you.” She gave me that mischievous smile once more and I felt my blood begin to rise up my neck.

I cleared my throat and nodded. “No worries there, Anna. I don’t want to miss breakfast with you.”

She grinned and gave me a playful shove towards the door.

I left the gym and made my way home, quickly stripping and stepping into the shower. The hot water helped to shed the weight of the previous night’s ordeal. I toweled off and tossed on some fresh clothes, the scent of detergent oddly comforting. When I glanced in the mirror, it was more out of habit than curiosity- just a quick check before heading out again.

But something made me stop.

My hair was still a sandy mess, but clean. I let my eyes drift down- eyebrows were fine, nothing new there- beard? Still refusing to cooperate, sadly. I paused, my focus narrowing. Had my shoulders always looked like that? Broader. A little more definition than I remembered. I blinked and tried to scan my memory. How long had it been since I’d *really* looked at myself?

It hit me that I didn’t, not often. Just quick glances. A habit of skimming over whatever stared back at me.

Maybe all this training was paying off, after all.

Shaking myself from my maundering, I straightened my clothes and opened a door to the outside of Wilhelm’s, startling a cat, who yowled loudly and sped off like a rocket. I shrugged and stepped out of the alleyway, to find both ladies stepping off the bus.

I slid up behind Anna and placed my hands on her shoulders. “Hello again,” I murmured in her ear.

She stiffened and squeaked loudly, causing Bethany’s head to whip around and a needle to appear between her fingers. She dropped the needle and laughed softly when she saw it was only me.

“Jackson Wernock! Don’t *do* that!” Anna swatted me with her hands as I chuckled. She crossed her arms and turned away from me. “Let’s get in while we can. Big jerk.”

I stepped forward and opened the door, gesturing for them to enter. “Beauty first.”

“Well. What do you know? My little Anna was right. You *are* charming. Thank you, Jackson. Anna? You first.”

Anna sputtered. “Wha? *Me*? Why *me?*”

I held her eyes with my gaze. “I *did* say that beauty was first.” I flashed a glance at Bethany. “I *did* say that, right? I didn’t just think it?”

“I do believe you *did*, Mr. Wernock. Beauty is first, therefore Anna must go in first.” She nodded sagely.

Anna, red-faced and shaky, walked in reluctantly. “I hate you guys.”

Bethany and I shared a laugh and followed Anna inside.

When I glanced in the mirror, it was more out of habit than curiosity- just a quick check before heading out again.

But something made me stop.

My hair was still a sandy mess, but clean. I let my eyes drift down- eyebrows were fine, nothing new there- beard? Still refusing to cooperate, sadly. I paused, my focus narrowing. Had my shoulders always looked like that? Broader. A little more definition than I remembered. I blinked and tried to scan my memory. How long had it been since I’d *really* looked at myself?

It hit me that I didn’t, not often. Just quick glances. A habit of skimming over whatever stared back at me.

Maybe all this training was paying off, after all.

Shaking myself from my maundering, I straightened my clothes and opened a door to the outside of Wilhelm’s, startling a cat, who yowled loudly and sped off like a rocket. I shrugged and stepped out of the alleyway, to find both ladies stepping off the bus.

I slid up behind Anna and placed my hands on her shoulders. “Hello again,” I murmured in her ear.

She stiffened and squeaked loudly, causing Bethany’s head to whip around and a needle to appear between her fingers. She dropped the needle and laughed softly when she saw it was only me.

“Jackson Wernock! Don’t *do* that!” Anna swatted me with her hands as I chuckled. She crossed her arms and turned away from me. “Let’s get in while we can. Big jerk.”

I stepped forward and opened the door, gesturing for them to enter. “Beauty first.”

“Well. What do you know? My little Anna was right. You *are* charming. Thank you, Jackson. Anna? You first.”

Anna sputtered. “Wha? *Me*? Why *me?*”

I held her eyes with my gaze. “I *did* say that beauty was first.” I flashed a glance at Bethany. “I *did* say that, right? I didn’t just think it?”

“I do believe you *did*, Mr. Wernock. Beauty is first, therefore Anna must go in first.” She nodded sagely.

Anna, red-faced and shaky, walked in reluctantly. “I hate you guys.”

Bethany and I shared a laugh and followed Anna inside.",1,1735105695.0,Words_From_Ivor,0,1.0,False

1hlup0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hlup0l/ending_the_best_relationship_ive_had_so_far/,Ending the Best Relationship I’ve Had So Far,"I (20F) recently ended a relationship with Ryan (20M), who I met during my senior year of high school. Talking about this feels like a step toward healing, and I hope sharing it helps me process everything better. The more I reflect on it, the clearer it becomes that our relationship was both meaningful and flawed. Here’s our story.

When I met Ryan, I had just decided I was ready for a relationship after years of failed talking stages and commitment fears. Ryan was in my class group for the first time at our charter school, where students moved together between subjects. I noticed him right away—he was incredibly shy, and I still remember our first eye contact in math class. I’d arrived late, and the only open seat was next to him. His blue eyes caught my attention instantly.

A few days later, during art class, we bonded over music. One day, I boldly suggested he give me his number so I could share my playlist with him. From there, we started texting nonstop. When he asked me in the courtyard if I had feelings for him, I was shocked—I thought my feelings were unreciprocated. As it turned out, our best friends had been scheming to get us together. Shortly after, we started dating.

From the beginning, there were challenges. Ryan was close to his best friend Miley, who had bullied him in their freshman year but later apologized. Miley was very physical with Ryan, often hugging him and clinging to him in ways that made me uncomfortable. She rarely acknowledged me, and it felt like she was disregarding our relationship. I tried to set boundaries, like asking if Miley could give us space on Valentine’s Day, but Ryan never enforced them. I’ll admit I struggled to advocate for myself, but I was also dealing with a chaotic and emotionally abusive home life, which made everything feel even harder.

A mentor eventually stepped in and talked to all three of us, highlighting the need for Miley to respect our relationship, for Ryan to understand my feelings, and for me to stand up for my needs. While things improved slightly, by the end of high school, Ryan and I realized we were clinging to the idea of being in a relationship rather than truly supporting each other. But instead of breaking up, we stayed together out of attachment.

During our first year of college, things became even more complicated. We chose different universities in our hometown, and I moved out of my abusive home to live with my grandparents. I started therapy and was diagnosed with anxiety and PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). I felt worthless at times and questioned whether I deserved to be in a relationship. Ryan, however, stuck by me and reassured me things would get better. With his support, I began to heal, and our relationship improved for a while. We hit milestones like losing our virginities to each other and creating new routines.

But as I grew healthier and more self-aware, I began asking for more from the relationship—dates, affection, and little gestures like flowers. I felt like I was giving my all, but Ryan’s efforts, while genuine, often fell short. Even so, we had good times, and we celebrated anniversaries feeling like things were finally stable.

The turning point came during our junior year. Ryan started therapy, which helped him confront his childhood trauma, but when he lost his insurance and had to stop, things took a downward spiral. Then two weeks ago, Miley called Ryan late at night, asking for a ride to the hospital. She didn’t want her family involved and turned to Ryan instead. I asked if her sister, who lived with her, could take her instead, but Miley insisted on Ryan. While I didn’t want anything bad to happen to Miley, I felt hurt that Ryan didn’t consider my discomfort in the situation.

Afterward, I told Ryan how I felt, but he dismissed my concerns with a nonchalant “sorry.” I brought it up again a week later, reminding him that even his therapist had warned he might one day have to choose between Miley and me. I told him I didn’t want Miley out of his life but that I also didn’t want him to be her backup plan when she had other options. This conversation led to a deeper realization—I had been asking for emotional support and respect for years, and he had rarely met me halfway.

Ryan said he needed time to think, so we went three days without contact. During that time, my mind kept circling back to everything I had done for him: helping him and his dad recover after surgeries, cooking, cleaning, and providing emotional support. I thought about how I’d begged for simple things like flowers or a date and how those needs were often unmet. When we finally met to talk, I could tell Ryan wanted to end things but was afraid to say it. So, I said it first: “Let’s break up.”

Ryan broke down crying, saying he didn’t want to become the villain by ending things. He insisted he needed to work on himself but didn’t want to ghost me entirely. He even suggested meeting for coffee in a few months. While part of me wanted to believe we could patch things up, I’ve realized through reflection and writing this that we’ve outgrown each other. It hurts to lose my first love—the person who taught me to drive, helped me grow, and shared so many milestones with me—but I’ve also cried more during our relationship than I have since we broke up.

There were moments during our breakup conversation that felt surreal, like when he joked about getting me pregnant if we were to sleep together one more time. That’s when I knew our dynamic had shifted into something unbalanced and unhealthy.

Now, I’m focusing on myself. I restarted therapy and am learning to value my own needs and boundaries. While I’ll always have love for Ryan, it’s no longer the kind of love that keeps a relationship alive. Breaking up was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made, but it was also the right one. I’m finally prioritizing my own happiness, and I’m hopeful for the future.

We seem to be innately very different people, but we’re both easy-going so it’s been working well enough? Since he’s been asking to get more serious though, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking (perhaps overthinking) and I’m worried I won’t be happy long term. 

For background, he’s an only child who spent a lot of his childhood alone and grew up nerdy without a lot of friends. He’s had one other serious relationship and they needed up living together for almost a year. I’m an eldest daughter who has “lived 100 lives” as he puts it, but has never moved in with a boyfriend. We’re also at that age where everyone around us are getting engaged and married and I think that he wants to get there too, as do I, but I’m not sure if it’s to him… The clock is ticking and I don’t want to get more serious if we’ll end up breaking up. 

I am more extroverted and I like to do things - doesn’t have to be extravagant but I like to make the most out of my day, whether that be running errands, going to the mall, checking out a market, grabbing coffee, maybe even baking decorating a gingerbread house (since it’s the holidays. He is self-admittedly more “boring” - he enjoys sitting at home watching movies, watching YouTube, playing video games. If I ask him to do something with me, he’ll do it, but occasionally complain. I keep finding myself sitting on the couch watching 2-3 movies in a row with him bc that’s what he always does but I’m bored out of my mind and I couldn’t care less about what movies were watching. 

Another issue, I’m generally not that talkative of a person but he is extra silent, which makes me the “yapper” in the relationship. It’s fine bc I’ve been putting in that effort and actively trying to make conversation with him all the time but today on a long drive, when I don’t put in that effort, we just sat in silence. I understand, that comfortable silence is fine but I’m a little sad that it seems like unless I ask him a bunch of questions, he doesn’t have anything to say, ever. I’ll even ask him “what are you thinking about” when he’s been quiet for awhile but he’ll always respond with “nothing” or something generic like “you”. 

This brings me to what bothers me the most: we spend time together but I don’t feel that close to him. When we hang out, we end up just sitting there watching movies and not doing much else. I’ve tried asking him questions that I think are important when considering a lifelong partnership like finances, goals, why are you attracted to me, what’s going well/not well in our relationship so far etc. but he always says that these are “heavy topics” and “why ruin a nice day”. I think what I’m feeling is a lack of emotional connection. 

There’s a bunch of other things we don’t really align on but this post is already getting long so maybe I’ll make a pt. 2 if need be. 

WITH ALL THIS SAID, it’s not all bad though, and that’s what’s confusing to me. He’s good to me and very kind. He’s takes me on nice dates, on trips, and buys me gifts and we have never reaallllyy fought or argued. Although, sometimes I wonder if we just don’t bring up what annoys us about each other for fear of confrontation. I don’t know if I’m being ungrateful or if we’re just not meant to be. 

Sometimes when I bring things up he’ll say stuff like “if I didn’t care, would I have taken you on a trip?” I understand what he’s saying but I don’t want him to point to things he’s done/bought in the past to make up for the fact that he doesn’t communicate with me. 

Another recent example, he gifted me something nice for Christmas but then gave it to me in the bag he bought it in and without a card. I asked him why he didn’t write a card, and that to me, the card is the most important part because he’s never written one to me yet and I want to know how he feels. 

Am I being a psycho gf or should we break up before things get serious? 

Tldr: my bf is nice to me and buys me things but I don’t feel an emotional connection because he refuses to REALLY talk to me. Should we continue to date and move in together?

Let’s be real: a video ad without a script or storyboard is like a rom-com without a meet-cute. Sure, you might get lucky and stumble upon brilliance, but most of the time, you’re left with an awkward mess. Trust me, nobody wants an ad that feels like it was improvised in a rush between coffee breaks.


---

📖 ""Scripts: The Unsung Heroes of Video Ads""
Think of the script as your GPS. It tells you exactly where to go, what to say, and how to get there without veering into ""uhhh"" territory. Without a script, you might end up with a 10-second ad that somehow takes 45 seconds to say, “Buy this thing.” Collectors don’t have time for that—they’re busy Googling rare baseball cards!


---

🖼️ ""Storyboards: Stick Figures, Big Impact""
""But I can’t draw!"" That’s okay! Storyboards don’t need to be Picasso-level masterpieces. Even stick figures will do the job. They’re like your ad’s dress rehearsal, helping you visualize the pacing, shots, and all the drama you want to pack in. Think of it as your chance to iron out the wrinkles before the camera starts rolling.


---

🎭 ""No Script, No Storyboard, No Sale""
Picture this: You’re trying to create an ad for rare luxury watches. Without a plan, your video might show more of the actor’s confused expression than the actual watch. Or worse, the watch is out of frame! With a script and storyboard, you know every second counts—and the spotlight stays exactly where it should.


---

🎯 ""Scripts + Storyboards = Collector Catnip""
For collectors, the smallest detail matters. Your video ad isn’t just selling a product; it’s selling a story, a vibe, a promise of exclusivity. Scripts and storyboards ensure your ad hits those emotional notes, whether it’s the thrill of a limited-edition find or the nostalgia of a vintage treasure.


---

🎬 ""The Final Scene: Why You Need Both""
So, do you need a script or storyboard? Only if you want your video ad to make sense, convert sales, and not feel like a rejected TikTok skit. Trust me, collectors will thank you—and so will your ROI. Now, go write that script and sketch those stick figures like your marketing budget depends on it. Because, well, it does!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining our well-being. Many people often wonder, ""how much water should I drink?"" The answer isn’t one-size-fits-all, but understanding the significance of water in your daily life can lead to optimal health. Here are ten reasons why knowing your hydration needs is crucial.

### 1. Enhances Physical Performance

When you exercise, your body loses water through sweat. If you're not properly hydrated, you may experience fatigue, reduced motivation, and increased perceived effort. Drinking enough water before, during, and after your workout can boost your physical performance significantly.

### 2. Promotes Digestive Health

Water plays a vital role in the digestive process. It helps dissolve nutrients and soluble fiber, making it easier for your body to absorb them. Staying well-hydrated can prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements, keeping your digestive system functioning smoothly.

### 3. Aids in Weight Management

If you're trying to lose weight, drinking water can be your best friend. Often, our bodies confuse thirst with hunger. By drinking water before meals, you can feel fuller and reduce the amount of food you consume. This simple habit can help you manage your weight effectively.

### 4. Supports Healthy Skin

Your skin is the largest organ in your body and requires adequate hydration to maintain its elasticity and vibrancy. By drinking enough water, you can reduce dryness and promote a healthier complexion, giving your skin a youthful glow.

### 5. Regulates Body Temperature

Water plays a crucial role in regulating your body temperature. When you're hot, your body releases sweat to cool itself down. Staying hydrated ensures that you have enough fluid to sweat efficiently, helping to keep your temperature stable, especially in warm weather or during vigorous activity.

### 6. Boosts Energy Levels

Feeling sluggish? It could be due to dehydration. Even mild dehydration can lead to decreased blood volume, which results in fewer nutrients and oxygen being delivered to your muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling tired and lethargic. Staying hydrated helps maintain your energy levels throughout the day.

### 7. Improves Cognitive Function

Believe it or not, your brain is made up of about 75% water. Dehydration can result in impaired concentration, memory problems, and increased feelings of anxiety or fatigue. By ensuring you drink enough water, you can support your cognitive function and mental clarity.

### 8. Supports Kidney Function

Your kidneys are responsible for filtering waste from your blood. Adequate hydration helps them perform this function more efficiently. Drinking enough water can help prevent kidney stones and urinary tract infections, keeping your renal system healthy.

### 9. Helps Maintain Electrolyte Balance

Electrolytes are essential for many bodily functions, including muscle contraction and nerve signaling. When you sweat, you're also losing electrolytes. Drinking water helps maintain the balance of electrolytes, which is crucial for ensuring that your muscles and nerves function properly.

### 10. Reduces Headaches

Many people experience headaches as a result of dehydration. When you're not getting enough fluids, your brain may temporarily shrink from fluid loss, leading to pain. By staying hydrated, you can significantly reduce the frequency and intensity of headaches.

Understanding ""how much water should I drink"" is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By recognizing the many benefits of proper hydration, you can take charge of your health and well-being. Make water a priority in your daily routine, and experience the transformation it brings to your life. Remember, everyone’s hydration needs differ. Listening to your body and responding appropriately will lead you towards optimal hydration and health.

Daily Hydration Needs: Factors That Influence Your Water Intake
---------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding your daily hydration needs is essential for maintaining good health. The amount of water you need to drink each day can vary based on several factors. Learning about these factors can help you personalize your water intake, ensuring that your body functions at its best.

First and foremost, your level of physical activity plays a significant role in determining how much water you should drink. If you’re active, you lose more water through sweat. This means you need to replenish your fluids regularly. For example:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- If you engage in light exercise, aim for an extra 1-2 cups of water.
- For moderate workouts, consider increasing your intake by 3-4 cups.
- If you're training vigorously or for extended periods, you might need to drink several extra cups, depending on duration and intensity.

Your environment is another crucial factor. High temperatures and humidity levels can increase your fluid needs since you sweat more in these conditions. Similarly, if you live at a high altitude, your body may require more water due to drier air and increased urination. Therefore, it’s beneficial to monitor the climate you’re in and adjust your intake accordingly.

Your body size and weight also influence your hydration needs. Generally, larger individuals need more water than those who weigh less. A common guideline suggests that you should drink at least half your body weight in ounces. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for at least 75 ounces of water each day.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Dietary choices can impact how much water you need as well. Foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables, can contribute to your overall hydration. Eating a balanced diet could help reduce your need to drink excessive amounts of water. On the other hand, high-protein diets or a lot of salt can increase your hydration needs. Here’s a quick list of foods to consider:

- Watermelon: Approximately 92% water
- Cucumber: About 95% water
- Strawberries: Roughly 91% water
- Spinach: Nearly 91% water

Another significant factor is your health status. If you’re ill or have health issues such as fever, diarrhea, or vomiting, your body requires more fluids. Certain medical conditions, like diabetes, may also increase your need for water. It's crucial to listen to your body and adjust your intake based on your health.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Age is a factor that shouldn’t be overlooked. As people age, their ability to conserve water decreases, which means they may feel less thirsty. Therefore, older adults need to be proactive about drinking enough water, even if they don't feel the urge. Regular hydration helps maintain bodily functions and prevents complications such as kidney stones or urinary tract infections.

Your gender can also influence how much water you should drink. Generally, men require more water than women due to differences in body composition. The National Academies of Sciences recommends about 3.7 liters (or about 13 cups) for men and 2.7 liters (or about 9 cups) for women daily from all beverages and foods combined.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Specific life circumstances such as pregnancy and breastfeeding increase water requirements. Pregnant women need about 10 additional cups of fluid per day, while breastfeeding mothers should ensure they drink enough to replace fluids lost during lactation.

Finding the perfect water intake for you involves considering various factors such as activity level, environment, body size, diet, health status, age, gender, and life circumstances. Staying well-hydrated is vital for maintaining your health, energy levels, and overall well-being. So, make it a daily habit to assess your hydration needs and drink enough water to support your unique lifestyle and requirements.

The Role of Water in Digestion and Nutrient Absorption
------------------------------------------------------

Water plays a crucial role in your body, especially when it comes to digestion and nutrient absorption. Staying hydrated not only keeps you feeling good, but it also helps your body function at its best. Let’s dive deeper into how water supports digestion and the absorption of vital nutrients.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Facilitates Digestion

Water is essential for breaking down food. When you eat, your stomach produces gastric juices, which are made up of water and other enzymes. These juices help your body digest food more easily. If you don’t drink enough water, your digestion can slow down, making you feel uncomfortable.

Here are some ways water facilitates digestion:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Increases gastric fluid:** Drinking adequate water increases the volume of gastric fluids, which supports digestion.
- **Prevents constipation:** Water helps keep your stool soft, making it easier to pass and preventing constipation.
- **Balances electrolytes:** Proper hydration keeps electrolyte levels balanced, which is vital for muscle contractions in the digestive tract.

### Aids in Nutrient Absorption

Once food is broken down, your body needs water to absorb the nutrients effectively. Water dissolves vitamins and minerals, making them easier for your body to absorb through your intestines.

Consider the following points regarding nutrient absorption:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Enhances nutrient transport:** Nutrients in the bloodstream are transported with the help of water, ensuring all body cells receive what they need.
- **Supports fat absorption:** Water helps in the emulsification of fats, allowing your body to absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K.
- **Improves enzyme function:** Enzymes, which are necessary for breaking down food further, require water to function properly.

### Regulates Body Temperature

Staying hydrated helps maintain body temperature, especially during digestion. When you eat, your body generates heat as it works to digest food. Water helps regulate this heat, preventing overheating and allowing for optimal digestive function.

### Promotes Saliva Production

Saliva, which is mostly water, plays a vital role in the initial stages of digestion. It helps break down food in your mouth, making swallowing easier. A well-hydrated body produces enough saliva to aid in digestion and protect your teeth and gums.

### Supports Detoxification

Water also aids your liver and kidneys in detoxifying your body. These organs work continuously to filter out toxins and waste. Drinking enough water ensures that they function efficiently, which is essential for overall health and well-being.

### Prevents Stomach Problems

Insufficient water intake can lead to various stomach issues. Issues such as acid reflux and bloating may become more prominent if you’re not hydrating enough. Drinking water helps keep your digestive system running smoothly and reduces the risk of these problems.

### Improves Absorption of Dietary Fiber

If you’re consuming fiber-rich foods, adequate water intake is crucial. Fiber absorbs water and expands in your digestive system, promoting a healthy digestive process. Without sufficient water, fiber can lead to discomfort and even constipation.

### Enhances Overall Health

Remember that every organ in your body relies on water for proper functioning. By keeping hydrated, you’re not only supporting digestion and nutrient absorption but also enhancing your overall health. Proper hydration can lead to clearer skin, better energy levels, and improved cognitive function.

Understanding the essential role of water in digestion and nutrient absorption can help you make better decisions about your health. Aim to drink enough water throughout the day to ensure your body functions at its best. Keeping hydrated is simple and can lead to substantial health benefits.

Staying properly hydrated is crucial, especially when it comes to physical performance. Water is not just a drink; it plays an integral role in how your body functions during exercise. Understanding the ways water affects your workout can help you maximize results and improve your overall health.

### Why Hydration Matters

Your body is made up of approximately 60% water, and this fluid is essential for nearly every function, including temperature regulation, joint lubrication, and nutrient transportation. When you exercise, you lose water through sweat and breathing. If you don’t replace that lost fluid, you can experience dehydration, which negatively impacts your physical performance.

### Here are key reasons why hydration is vital for your workout:

- **Maintains Performance Levels:** Even a small decrease in hydration can lead to reduced strength, endurance, and overall performance. Staying hydrated ensures you can push yourself during workouts.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Water helps regulate your body temperature during exercise. When you sweat, your body cools down. If you’re not hydrated, your ability to sweat diminishes, making it harder to keep your body cool.
- **Enhances Muscle Function:** Muscles need water to perform at their best. It helps in fueling muscle contractions and can reduce the risk of cramps. Ensuring adequate hydration helps you lift heavier and train longer.
- **Supports Joint Health:** Water acts as a lubricant for your joints, reducing the risk of injury during physical activities. Keeping your joints hydrated can help you move freely and comfortably, especially during high-impact workouts.
- **Aids in Recovery:** Proper fluid levels are essential for recovery after exercising. Water helps transport nutrients that repair muscle tissue and aids in flushing out toxins from your body.

### Signs of Dehydration to Watch For

Recognizing the signs of dehydration can help you address the issue before it impacts your performance:

- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Increased fatigue
- Dark-colored urine
- Dry mouth or excessive thirst
- Muscle cramps

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

The amount of water you need can vary based on factors like body weight, exercise intensity, and duration. A general guideline is to drink:

- **Before Exercise:** 16-20 ounces at least 2 hours prior to your workout.
- **During Exercise:** 7-10 ounces every 10-20 minutes, depending on your workout intensity and heat.
- **After Exercise:** 16-24 ounces for every pound lost during the exercise session.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Maintaining hydration doesn't have to be difficult. Here are a few easy tips to make sure you're drinking enough fluids:

- Carry a water bottle with you throughout the day as a reminder to drink.
- Set reminders on your phone to sip water regularly.
- Infuse your water with fruits or herbs for taste if plain water is unappealing.
- Consume foods with high water content, like fruits and vegetables.

### Final Thoughts

Hydration is an essential component of achieving optimal physical performance. By understanding how water impacts your body, recognizing the signs of dehydration, and implementing proactive hydration strategies, you are setting yourself up for success in your fitness journey. Remember that staying hydrated not only enhances your workouts but also supports your overall health. So, drink up, and let your body thrive!

Common Myths About Hydration and Water Consumption
--------------------------------------------------

Water is vital for your health, yet there are many misunderstandings about hydration and how much water you should drink. Let’s dive into some of the common myths surrounding hydration and separate fact from fiction to help you make informed choices.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

Many people believe that drinking eight glasses of water daily is necessary for good health. While this rule is easy to remember, your water needs depend on various factors like age, gender, activity level, and climate. Instead of adhering strictly to eight glasses, listen to your body. Thirst is a reliable indicator that you need to hydrate.

### Myth 2: All Beverages Count Towards Your Daily Water Intake

Another common myth is that all liquids contribute equally to hydration. While beverages like tea, coffee, and juice do count, some drinks can dehydrate you. Caffeinated drinks are mild diuretics, meaning they can lead to increased urination. It's best to prioritize water as your main hydration source, especially after physical activities.

### Myth 3: You Can Hydrate with Food Alone

Some people think that consuming water-rich foods, like fruits and vegetables, is enough for hydration. While these foods are beneficial, they do not replace the need for drinking water. Foods can help keep you hydrated, but they should complement your water intake, not replace it.

### Myth 4: If You're Not Thirsty, You Don't Need to Drink Water

Relying solely on thirst to gauge your hydration levels can be misleading. Many individuals don’t feel thirsty until they’re already dehydrated, especially older adults. Make it a habit to drink water regularly, even if you don't feel thirsty, to prevent dehydration.

### Myth 5: Dark Urine Means You’re Dehydrated

While dark urine can indicate dehydration, it’s not the only factor to consider. Urine color can vary based on diet, medications, and other health conditions. A more accurate way to check hydration is by paying attention to your overall well-being. If you feel good, you may be adequately hydrated.

### Myth 6: Drinking Water Before Meals Helps You Lose Weight

Some claim that drinking water before meals aids weight loss by reducing hunger. While staying hydrated is important for weight management, drinking water alone won't automatically lead to weight loss. A balanced diet and healthy lifestyle are crucial for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.

### Myth 7: You Can’t Drink Too Much Water

Though drinking water is essential, it's also possible to overhydrate. Conditions like hyponatremia occur when there’s an imbalance of electrolytes in the body due to excessive water intake. This can be dangerous. It’s vital to drink in moderation and pay attention to your body’s signals.

### Myth 8: Sports Drinks Are Necessary for Hydration

Sports drinks are often marketed to athletes, suggesting that they are essential for hydration. For most people, plain water suffices for hydration, even during exercise. Sports drinks can contain high amounts of sugar and calories that are unnecessary unless you are engaging in prolonged, intense physical activity.

### Myth 9: Cold Water Is Worse Than Room Temperature Water

Some believe that cold water can shock the system and is less beneficial than water at room temperature. In reality, temperature does not significantly affect hydration. Drink water at whatever temperature you prefer; the key is that you are drinking enough to stay hydrated.

### Myth 10: You Only Need to Hydrate on Hot Days

Many think they only need to focus on hydration during hot weather or while exercising. In truth, you need to hydrate year-round, as your body loses water even when it’s cold or you’re at rest. Make drinking water a daily habit regardless of the season.

By dispelling these common myths about hydration, you can better understand your body’s needs. Remember, staying hydrated is key to maintaining your health, so make an effort to drink enough water each day. Aim for clear or pale yellow urine, sip water throughout the day, and listen to your body's cues to feel your best!

### Conclusion

Understanding ""how much water should I drink"" is a vital aspect of maintaining optimal health. Your daily hydration needs can change based on various factors such as your age, activity level, climate, and overall health. Recognizing what influences your water intake helps you tailor a hydration plan that suits your lifestyle.

Water plays a crucial role in digestion and nutrient absorption. It helps break down food, allowing your body to extract and use nutrients effectively. Staying properly hydrated can improve your digestive health and overall well-being.

Moreover, if you’re active, you know how critical hydration is for physical performance. Water regulates body temperature, lubricates joints, and transports nutrients to muscles. Ensuring you drink enough water not only helps enhance your workouts but also boosts recovery, leading to better performance over time.

Additionally, separating fact from fiction is essential when it comes to hydration. There are common myths about how much water you need, and understanding these misconceptions allows you to develop a more accurate perspective on your hydration goals.

Ultimately, how much water you should drink is not a one-size-fits-all answer. By considering your individual needs and lifestyle factors, you can make informed choices that contribute to a healthier life. Prioritize your hydration, listen to your body, and adjust your intake accordingly. Embracing proper water consumption can lead to improved energy levels, wellness, and a fulfilling, healthier lifestyle.",1,1735104312.0,HydrogenWaterFast,0,1.0,False
1hluhjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1hluhjq/aita_for_wanting_to_open_gifts_with_my_family_on/,AITA for wanting to open gifts with my family on christmas,"My husband and I are in our thirties. We live across the country from our families. His family is larger than mine but no one is as close as mine (everyone rarely talks to one another). My mom's favorite holiday is Christmas and in our military family she would always budget and get little things throughout the year and she's always made it a big Christmas with gifts, stockings, dinner, and a movie each year as my sisters and I were growing up. It was a priority for her. One of my sisters lives in Texas with her husband. My other sister and parents are in California. My husband and I live in Connecticut. 
Every year my mom sends us a big box with wrapped gifts. I send her gifts and my sisters gifts. We all join a Google meet call and open presents together and talk. We usually are all on call for a couple of hours, past just opening gifts. My husband is extremely uncomfortable with it. Every year he complains and we argue over 1. his issue with my mom sending presents for us, and 2. opening gifts with them.
 He says:
- it is making Christmas all about presents, 
- we don't get to have Christmas to ourselves because we have to open presents with them,
- he says my mom is just trying to keep us all kids and controlling, and 
-how he hates christmas.
 It honestly makes me so mad that just because he is so weird about accepting gifts that he tries to make me feel shameful for something that has been normal in my family. This year he also added complaining about stockings saying we don't need to do stockings or hang stockings, it's just him and I (and our pets). I've always just put a candybar and 1 small gift in there ( such as his favorite face cleanser, a new to go coffee cup, new socks). 

My mom and I are both big gift givers, I love making and finding things for people and I put a lot of consideration into gifts for people. I don't care what I get but I have a lot of fun and feel like I make people happy in what I pick out for them... She is the same way. In the past I asked her to dial it back with the amount she would send and she has, slightly. I won't always have her around and it just feels like we kind of let her go a bit overboard because she misses us so much and it's her favorite holiday. It is also in just my husband and I in CT, no family out here and it feels nice to video call and open gifts together despite all the miles between. 
I truly feel stressed just getting him a gift, having gifts around, and even mentioning Christmas day. It makes me feel like I don't want to do Christmas with him. He can go sulk or have an alone day to play video games.

Am I the asshole for wanting to open gifts with my family? And either way, how do we meet in the middle?",1,1735104293.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

It’s a tongue-in-cheek parody—no real malice intended. Enjoy the roast!

# The Almighty Sleep-Deprived Gods of CLT

Let’s begin by paying tribute to the omnipotent beings that roam the Computer Lab Theater (CLT) at 3 AM, fueled by caffeine and last-minute assignment adrenaline. They’re the geniuses who can figure out quantum encryption algorithms but will inevitably forget their ID cards when walking into the lab. Their favourite pastime? Using dark backgrounds in IDEs for that sweet “hacker aesthetic,” plus it helps hide the tear stains.

# The Endless Queue for “Elite” Courses

CSE folks will line up faster than *Biriyani Night in Gurunath* if you so much as whisper, “There’s an ML elective open!” Then half of them spend the semester shouting, “Wait, so what’s backprop again?” The scramble to get into the “cool courses” is more brutal than **Canteen on a Sunday**. And let’s not forget the absolute meltdown that occurs when the professor changes the grading scheme from relative to absolute. The horror!

# Stacks, Queues, and Overinflated Egos

Ah yes, data structures and the inflated sense of self-worth. It seems half of the CSE junta can’t hold a normal conversation without dropping at least one obscure CS reference. A typical statement might be: *“I can’t wait to ‘pop’ my code from GitHub, then ‘push’ it to a new branch, you know?”* Meanwhile, the rest of us are just trying to ask if they’d like some extra sambhar.

# The Startup Hype-Fest

Who can forget the glorious “I’m the next CEO of a startup” flex? Everyone’s working on an AI-driven, neural-quantum-blockchain aggregator for distributing *vada-pav* more efficiently. They’ll regale you with seed-round lingo until you realize their “MVP” is basically a Python script that prints *“Hello, World!”* And just in case you missed the vibe, “technical co-founder” is often code for “I have no idea how to pitch to real investors, but I can absolutely break the campus LAN to run my deep learning scripts.”

# Open-Source? More Like “Open-Snore”

CSE also prides itself on building open-source tools. Or, well, making a GitHub repo, writing a *two-line README*, and then ghosting the entire project because apparently, Overwatch 2 is more important. The unspoken motto: if you can’t add a fancy README badge, does it even exist?

# Competitive Programming = Personality

Nothing screams “I’m the chosen one” like finishing a CodeChef challenge in 15 minutes. If you attempt to chat them up mid-contest, they’ll throw around edgy words like “dp solution,” “bitmask approach,” or “fast I/O,” and then stare at you like you should already worship their GfG profile. Everyone in the lab knows there’s only one correct greeting: *“Hey, what’s your codeforce rating, dude?”*

# Placement Season Panic

Yes, the starry-eyed seniors who pass your corridor yelling, “No, Mom, I swear I’ll get a 1+ Crore package!” The frenzy is comedic: suit up, pick a fancy resume template off the internet, add some “projects” that have never seen the light of day, and pray that the interviewer is enthralled by your “Python proficiency” from that one Kaggle dataset you toyed with.

# The Myth of Work-Life Balance

CSE folks love to proclaim they’re masters of the work-life balance, right until you see them at 2 AM coding away, living off Maggi, with dark circles so deep they could store all of JEE sample papers in them. Their social life is the exact complexity of an NP-hard problem—nobody’s sure if it can exist. Yet they still somehow manage a sarcastic remark: *“I haven’t been home in two semesters, but at least I used a neat BFS approach on that hackathon project.”*

# Conclusion

Of course, deep down, we all know CSE at IIT Madras is filled with some of the brightest minds: the code wizards, the algorithmic gladiators, the ones who’ll eventually run half of India’s tech scene. But hey, it’s always fun to poke fun at your brilliance and remind everyone that, behind the Java code and the Kaggle kernels, y’all are just as human as the rest of us.

So let’s keep calm, compile, and enjoy making AI robots that will inevitably take over the hostel chores. Because if there’s one thing CSE folks can code in their sleep, it’s a piece of software that saves them from washing their own clothes.

**Roast delivered!** Now, back to sipping on that coffee while you try to break the CLT’s deadlines. If you’re reading this on your phone in the lab, hurry up! Someone’s about to snatch your seat—apparently, they’re training a neural net that can predict the best samosa vendor on campus.

SOLA BAJA area, please be on the lookout for this man. He stole my scooter after I forgot to lock it up for a very short period of time in the morning. Yes, my fault, but I'm really bothered as I have had this Bird scooter for 5-6 years and it was a bit sentimental to me. It is a very very distinguishable as it is covered in stickers. It is black with a silver logo on it that says bird. The back wheel cover is broken (loose) and some of the stickers on it are: Radio coffee and beer (the big mountains sticker), Ripley from aliens on the front, a spaceship with a rainbow just below the light and a few beer companies like meanwhile. I wish I had a recent picture of it but I don't think I do. There a bunch of other stickers on it too but I just cannot recall right now. I imagine he will either sell it, pawn it or abandon it once it runs out of battery because he has no way to charge it.

If you see it abandoned let me know. I also filed a report with the police, though I have doubts it will do anything. Give me any tips too on what I can do like is it worth it to call local pawn shops to see if they have it?

Some background. I do have a hearing disability (severe hearing loss in one ear) since childhood. Probably was born with it. My parents didn't know until I was around 5 years old which is when I started wearing a hearing aid.

On first date, I did bring it up about my hearing aid which she seemed okay with. However, after the 1st date and we talked on the phone next day, my date asked me some bizarre questions such as: ""Have you ever had genetic testing done?"" , ""Any relatives with hearing issues?"", ""Have you ever been bullied in childhood due to your hearing aid?"", ""If someone were to present a word on a piece of paper to you, can you speak the written word?"". I kinda stumbled to these questions and felt kinda annoyed. Especially the last question. I mean, I am a dentist after all, I know how to say words from a piece of paper, lol. I understand women are going to be curious and ask questions but I felt these kinds of specific questions were improper.

Should I bother seeing her again or give her a chance? It just comes off she may lack kindness/empathy over a superficial thing and somewhat neurotic about it. What do you think?

1hlu5lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1hlu5lj/serious_improvement_in_symptoms/,Serious improvement in symptoms ,"I’m 27F and have had acid reflux for ~10 years, which often manifests as silent reflux (feeling like my throat is closing/tight, having the acid-y taste in my throat and mouth). It’s flared on and off for years; 7 years ago I had an endoscopy when I had a lot of throat tightening and they found nothing and it eventually went away. About six months ago, I think due to gaining about 5- 10 pounds (I am still fairly thin though, which I only note bc weight can trigger it a lot) and being stressed, the throat tightness came back with a vengeance and I ended up in the ER with a panic attack. My doc put me on 40 mg omeprazole, which helped but not enough. I continued to feel like food was stuck in my throat and like my throat was tight, have bad post nasal drip, and even started getting nauseous/losing my appetite and just having bad digestion issues. At times the acid feeling would hurt my throat and even my back too. I ended up getting an endoscopy again and they found mild chronic gastritis and a small sliding hiatial hernia. 

I ended up making some changes and here is what ACTUALLY worked and I would recommend:
- If nothing else take zinc carsonine. I read up on this and it got rave reviews for people with gastritis and acid reflux. I take one capsule after every meal, so 2-3 times a day, and it has helped all these issues a LOT. In fact, in Japan they use zinc carsonine to treat gastritis. 
- I also got allergy tested and it turns out I’m allergic to a LOT of stuff which was making everything worse. I now take Zyrtec everyday.
- I also went on Zoloft. I’m only on 25 mg but it heas helped the anxiety that I think led to many of these issues a LOT. However, Zoloft itself can cause stomach issues - I had a lot of nausea when i started it - so beware of that. It also still gives me diarrhea but it’s worth it for the improved peace of mind.
- This one sucks, but I also gave up coffee. This was hard because I used to drink two cups a day, but my GI doc said it would help, and it did. It felt like I went through withdrawal for about two months, since i was drinking no caffeine and felt super tired all the time. About three months in, so about two months ago, I started drinking black tea with milk and that’s been great. It’s easy on my stomach and I like the ritual of having a hot drink in the morning, and it gives me a caffeine boost. 
- I also got a wedge pillow, I’m not sure how much of a difference it made since I did all this stuff at the same time but I like to sleep on it now. And now I never wake up with that acid-y feeling at night. 
- Nowadays I eat pretty much whatever I want, but I try to stay away from tomato sauces and things like that, although pizza is fine, and dark chocolate because those trigger me. I also drink a bit less than I did before but if I know I’m going to drink I’ll take an antacid. But I went to Oktoberfest in October and drank beer, ate what I wanted (fries, schnitzel etc) and was totally fine. 
- When I got nauseous, I take ginger mints from Trader Joe’s - they are a lifesaver. 

In conjunction with these changes, I was on omeprazole 40 mg for about two months, then weaned off that as I went on famotidine 40 mg because my GI doctor said it’s better for long term use. Eventually I halved that, so I was on an OTC dose of famotidine everyday, and then I weaned off that and only take it as needed now. 

Now I really only get these symptoms when I overeat, usually in conjunction with drinking. 

I got a lot of advice and sought a lot of comfort on Reddit when I was really stressed so I tope this helps someone!! These issues suck but there are ways to improve! ",5,1735102908.0,acidreflux,3,1.0,False

1hlu4jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/IISc/comments/1hlu4jh/roast_iiscs_cse_chatgpt/,Roast IISc's CSE - ChatGPT,"Below is a tongue-in-cheek, hyperbolic roast intended purely for humorous effect. **Disclaimer**: This is satire. The Computer Science department at IISc is world-renowned, and these jokes are merely playful jabs—not actual critiques.

# The Superlative Roast of IISc’s CSE

**1. The Department that Never Sleeps**  
If the sleepless nights in IISc CSE labs could generate electricity, Bangalore’s power cuts would be a thing of the past. Rumor has it, the only reason there’s a sunrise on campus is to remind CSE folks how many nights they’ve already pulled without blinking.

**2. The Labyrinth of Labs**  
Trying to find your lab in the CSE building is like navigating a codebase that hasn’t been documented since 1995. By the time you locate your lab, your relatives have started questioning your existence. But hey, at least you’ll know a BFS from a DFS by the time you make it back out alive.

**3. Infinite Deadlines, Finite Sanity**  
The department loves deadlines more than actual lines of code. Every assignment has a submission date so tight, you’d think there’s a global competition to see how fast you can burn out. But don’t worry—you’ll get an extension… right after your sanity has officially departed the building.

**4. Professors: The Final Bosses**  
IISc CSE professors are basically bullet-hell games in human form. You come with your well-prepared queries, and they unleash a barrage of theorems, references, and “this is basic knowledge!” retorts that leave you questioning if you’ve been studying at all.

**5. The Myth of Free Time**  
There’s a rumour that once upon a time, an IISc CSE student finished an assignment early and took a break. That rumour remains unconfirmed. Some suspect it’s an urban legend meant to give newcomers false hope. Others believe the student simply got lost on campus and was never seen again.

**6. Coffee over Blood**  
Forget your blood type—only your caffeine type matters here. Expect to identify yourself by how many espresso shots you need just to open your laptop. Don’t be shocked if your “fasting blood test” comes back positive for 80% Arabica.

**7. Coding, Crying, and More Coding**  
In typical classes, the ratio of code to tears is about 1:1. The only place you’ll see more tears is at a marathon debugging session where your code “compiles on my machine” but fails on the server. This is commonly referred to as the “CSE Yoga Pose,” where you hold your head in your hands and wonder about your life choices.

**8. Where “Free Wi-Fi” = Endless Git Pulls**  
Sure, you’ve got lightning-fast internet—just not the time to use it for anything fun. If Netflix or YouTube dares to appear on your browser, the assignment gods will smite your router. So your watchlist remains as mythical as your social life.

**9. Particle Physicists Are Jealous**  
With the experiments CSE folks run in labs, you’d think they’re discovering new quarks daily. The difference? Particle physicists smash subatomic particles to find hidden truths; CSE folks smash keyboards at 3 AM trying to fix a memory leak they introduced at 2:59 AM.

**10. Graduation = Release from Beta**  
When you finally graduate, you don’t actually “finish.” You get shipped into the industry like half-tested open-source software, then spend your entire career patching the knowledge gaps introduced by your choice to eat, sleep, or breathe instead of paying attention in that one advanced algorithms class.

# Final Words

So here’s to IISc’s CSE—a glorious realm where stress is currency, coffee is religion, and the code compiles only when the cosmos align. After all, if it didn’t break you just a little bit, would it *really* be IISc?

*(Reminder: This is all in good fun! In reality, IISc CSE’s reputation stands on decades of exceptional research, mind-bending innovation, and dedicated faculty. May your code run bug-free, your labs have decent AC, and your deadlines be ever gracious.)*",5,1735102815.0,IISc,0,1.0,False
1hlu4at,https://www.reddit.com/r/hdfidelity/comments/1hlu4at/hdfidelity_presents_clink/,hdfidelity presents Clink,"A ChatGPT Story     
### **Title: “Clink”**  

The story opens with Alex perched on a barstool at his favorite neighborhood pub. It's December 23rd, and the place is alive with holiday revelry: twinkling lights, ugly sweaters, and laughter bubbling like champagne. But Alex? He’s nursing an old-fashioned and quietly wondering if holiday cheer is some kind of inside joke he missed the punchline to.  

---

**Bartender:** (dryly, while polishing a glass) “Another one for ya, Alex?”  
**Alex:** (gestures to his barely touched drink) “Nah, still working on my first one. Don’t want to outpace the crowd.”  
**Bartender:** “The crowd’s already on round four.”  
**Alex:** (glances around) “Yeah, well, I’m pacing myself for the gold.”  
**Bartender:** (pauses, smirks) “Championship material, huh?”  
**Alex:** “Nah, just trying to finish this drink without looking like I’m *waiting* for someone who isn’t coming.”  

---

Alex has been here before—not just this pub, but this exact feeling. The holidays always magnify his solitude in that special, sparkly way only twinkle lights can. He’s not bitter about it. He’s even good at being alone most of the time. But tonight, with couples leaning into each other and friends clinking glasses like it’s the Olympics of camaraderie, it stings a little.  

He checks his phone. Nothing. A few group texts buzzing with “Merry Christmas!” energy from friends he hasn’t seen since college, and a missed call from his mom.  

*Mom means well, but even she knows I’d rather faceplant into a snowbank than endure another “you should settle down” speech over ham and scalloped potatoes.*  

So he decides to shake things up. He leaves the pub and wanders into the city, searching for *something*. A spark. A connection. A goddamn link in this calamity.  

---

**Scene Two: The Holiday Mixer**  

Alex ends up at a “friends-of-friends” holiday party in a cramped apartment. It smells like mulled wine and desperation. Everyone’s already paired off into tight circles, swapping work horror stories and laughing too hard at mediocre jokes.  

**Party Host:** “Alex! So glad you made it. Help yourself to some eggnog!”  
**Alex:** (grins) “Thanks. Is there...less egg, more nog?”  
**Party Host:** “Haha, no. But there’s wine!”  
**Alex:** “Perfect. That’ll pair well with my crippling social anxiety.”  

He retreats to a corner, clutching a plastic cup of something neat, and attempts small talk with a woman wearing reindeer antlers. It doesn’t go well.  

**Reindeer Antlers Lady:** “So, what do you *do*?”  
**Alex:** “I’m in publishing. You know, books, magazines. Things people don’t read anymore.”  
**Reindeer Antlers Lady:** “Oh. I only read Kindle books.”  
**Alex:** (deadpan) “Cool. I only write on typewriters.”

**Scene Three: The 24-Hour Diner**  

Hours later, Alex finds himself in a diner. It’s one of those fluorescent-lit oases that only exist for night owls and existential crises. He orders pancakes because it feels like the only logical move at this point.  

That’s when Jamie walks in—tousled hair, oversized coat, and an air of casual chaos. She sits at the counter, two stools away, and orders coffee like her life depends on it.  

**Jamie:** (to the waiter) “And keep it coming. I’m running on fumes and spite.”  
**Alex:** (without thinking) “Spite’s not great for your digestion.”  
**Jamie:** (glances over, smirking) “Neither is diner coffee.”  

Alex and Jamie exchange a few lines—banter that starts light but unexpectedly deepens. She’s not from the city but wandered in after missing her train home for the holidays. Alex tells her about the pub, the party, and his hunt for connection.  

**Jamie:** “See, you should’ve led with that mulled wine story. That’s tragic comedy gold.”  
**Alex:** “Glad you think so. It’s mostly just tragic from my angle.”  
**Jamie:** “Nah. You’re just bad at picking parties.”  

---

By the time the pancakes arrive, the two are laughing over shared holiday mishaps, obscure song lyrics, and their mutual disdain for a drink called eggnog. Jamie pulls a flask from her coat and pours a splash of something strong into their coffee cups.  

**Jamie:** (raising her mug) “To better holidays and less suspicious beverages.”  
**Alex:** (clinks mugs with her) “And to meeting people who don’t think eggnog is a personality.”

Thanks for clicking in. I'm Matt, 30, from Idaho. Dating around my parts feels clumsy, and often times feels like the kind of person I'm looking for isn't in this area, so I thought I'd give online a bit of a try.

[This is me!](https://imgur.com/a/Hwo0of1)

A bit about me!

* I just turned 30 a little bit ago. It was a terrifying experience at first, but I pretty quickly got over it lol. It overall encouraged me to target the areas in my life that I'm unhappy with to work towards making change there!
* Physically, I'm blonde haired, green/blue eyes, 5'10 or 5'11"", depending on the doctor (Still chronically short for Tinder), overall a pretty thin individual. I'd like to get back into working out, as I used to do calisthenics as a way to get into shape and be more active. I do wear glasses, which isn't portrayed in my pictures, however I'm happy to send you one with me wearing them!
* I currently work a WFH job as an analyst for some pretty large companies across the country, however I'm trying to change into tech/cybersecurity. It's a bit of a process, but I've been able to make some solid connections to progress in this!
* I'm likely trying to move to the east coast at some point, so potentially something to keep in mind! Likely, South Carolina.
* I'm Christian, however the kicker here is that I typically hold more liberal views. This is one of the biggest challenges to dating in my area, as it's heavily conservative.
* At this point in my life, I don't think I want children.
* I used to stream, and ran a pretty successful little stream for the amount of time I put into it! I'm still active in those communities.
* I'm more of an introvert, and I consider myself pretty low maintenance. I do enjoy nights in, however going out is lovely as well. Nature walks, coffee shops (Oooh, original), all of that are great! Bar scenes are less my type. Board games, playing piano (I really need to get back into this, or start another instrument), or a few select games on the computer are my interests. I typically find myself on Twitch lately.
* I attend counseling every two weeks to keep my mental health in balance, and help create better relationships.
* I tend to find my love languages somewhere between spending quality time, and physical touch, so this is a *less than ideal* way to meet someone, but you never know who you'll meet!

What I'm looking for!

* Naturally, I'd like to be physically attracted to someone (And I hope you would be too!).
* Someone who is taking care of themselves, physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. Maturity in all of this is lovely.
* Kindness. Please. Let's be kind humans together.
* I'm so attracted to intelligence, to the point where I've been bored lately without people to have deep conversations with. The last relationship I had taught me how much I actually value these.
* I'd ideally like someone younger than me, probably between 25-28, but I'm open!
* The closer someone is, the better ultimately, but again- You never know who you'll meet.
* I want to be friends with someone first, which feels an almost ironic statement for this, but sincerely building a relationship off a friendship has been the best experiences for me. I'd like to get to know you, hang out, no pressure, and if we don't vibe, that's fine! I'm still happy to make a friend.

Thank you for reading all of this. I look forward to hearing from you!",1,1735102687.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I am curious about the Normcore basket, there was no information about it on the box or inside the box of the portafilter. The Normcore website says it's a 16-18 gram basket, but then why is it so much bigger than the IMS basket I have that is also 16 to 18 grams? It's so deep that it won't even fit in the standard portafilter my De'Longhi came with, while the IMS basket fits in both.

I just watched this and quickly googled to see who else was talking about it. My mind is so busy with thought. I haven't even slept on it yet but I have a...revelation?

I've admitted to anyone who will listen that I'm rarely lonely. I'm an introvert I say. I'm single and have no kids so I am not obligated daily to interact with anyone. However, after watching Join or Die, I can't help but wonder if I'm not actually an introvert but instead have become so because of the lack of a welcoming community.

I'm 56 so growing up, we were just *outside*. *Like all the time.* You meet a kid and before the end of the day you had a new friend. Same with adults. Parents met so-and-so at the market and shortly thereafter might be having coffee together or chatting after work. It's like being social was just...there. We didn't even have to look for it. Today, I can't even tell you the full names of 5 people in my building, and I've lived here almost a decade.

I've frequently said I was born too late. Not that the world was all the great previously but I always thought I'd be hosting dinners and little parties with friends like my parents did. I still wish I could have get togethers where we have some drinks, pull out backgammon or some other board games and just chat the night away. It doesn't happen. I've even tried to find backgammon groups in my area and nothing. (Don't need suggestions, I've searched high and low and even considered starting one but the real backgammon groups with tournaments and all are way more serious than I care to bother with.)

I've often said the one thing I kinda wish I'd done in my 20s and 30s was be more social, cultivate more relationships. Because even though I don't feel lonely right now, having a sense of community even just among good friends is comforting. Like the next 4 years will be pure hell and I wish I didn't have to get through it as alone as I've been. I do have literally 3 good friends and I'd rather a few good ones than a bunch of associates. But I think many of us have carved out very lonely futures.

Fortunately, I've awaken over the years and have gotten more involved right in my own neighborhood. My library has lovely art viewings and our neighborhood association has game nights where I was actually gifted a gorgeous lacquered tournament style backgammon board from the association just because I loved the game so much and no one else came to play every week except me and the organization's director. It starts again in the spring and I'm looking forward to it.

","My (26F) husband (32 M) have been married for 8 months. We have lived together for 3 years. We have a joint bank account for rent and groceries, and our own separate accounts for our personal needs.

For a few months before we got married, I was using our joint account for personal things because my bank account was hacked and there were payments I needed to make before my account’s issues could be sorted out. I did alert my husband to this and at first he was okay with it because I always paid everything back on time and never missed a payment, but eventually he grew uncomfortable and I ended up being able to make a new bank account for myself and resolve the issue. Since then I have not bought anything personal using our joint cards.

We are planning a vacation to South Korea in june. This will be a week and a half, and it’s estimated the trip will be around $6000 for both of our round trip tickets, lodging, food, and planned excursions. My husband makes 80k a year, while I make 34k as I am also a student getting my masters and hopefully PhD. Despite this disparity in our incomes, I have always felt fine with how we split things and feel confident we will both be able to contribute even more than the estimated 6k for this trip as we both work full time. However, my husband is constantly micromanaging everything I buy. Everything.

Coffees, clothes, hobbies, everything. He has been watching me like a hawk when it comes to how I spend my own money. At first I didn’t think much of it, but then it started to get a little aggressive. He was saying how with the credit card “issue” we had months prior and with my spending now, he thinks we will not be able to afford the trip AND I will have no savings of my own. I have tried to explain to him that I have a sizable savings account held up for when we purchase a house, and I always paid back the credit card and now use my own and also pay that off (usually runs about $800-$1200 per month). He claims he thinks our financial future is unsustainable with my lifestyle, and one day came to me in tears about it. 

This of course broke me, as I really had no intention of stressing him out this much, so I began to cut back more. No more coffee runs, no more new clothes, no more really much of anything. My credit card statements now range from $200-$600 due to the holidays, and I still am working and paying off my schooling as I have done before we got married. 

I had an expensive ($150) outfit that I decided to gift to a friend. My husband found out about this and asked me why I did not sell it instead. I told him that I just gave it to my friend as I know she would wear it more than I did, and she has definitely gotten me things of equal value in the past so I didn’t think much of it. This lead to him ignoring me all night. I kept asking what was wrong and he would just say “it would make more sense to sell it as its expensive” and why did I not tell him before doing so. I told him that I’m beginning to feel a little uncomfortable because I don’t need to run every decision by him. And he just continued to say the same thing about how I should have sold it instead, and cited the vacation as why I should be saving or getting more money.

This lead me to remember every time we have argued in the past, especially when it came to money, about how he will just nag and constantly say his feelings until I give in and just agree to whatever he wants. I told him that my feelings matter too, and I do not question him about what he gives to friends or anything and he said “I don’t give things to friends” and therefore just shut me down. And now he continues to ignore or just act cold towards me.

I know this is just my side of the story, but we really do not live paycheck to paycheck, and there was never a time where we were almost on the edge of any sort of financial turmoil. When we first met I did spend a lot of money on clothes and food, but I am genuinely trying to change that about myself and I think I have.

I vented to one of my friends about this and she said that we need couples counseling asap and our marriage will fail. And now I am so conflicted. I do not know what to do. I do not think this is really about the money, he just seems to be so stubborn and will not accept any other opinion but his own. If he is worried we won’t have money for the trip, then I must be equally or more worried that we won’t have money. If I do get a coffee and ask him to get out of the car and get it for me while I drive, he will sit and say since I “had to have it” I should be the one to go get it.

I just want to know if anyone else has been in this situation before, and is there something I am not seeing in our relationship that can make him happy and better things between us? Thank you for reading.",3,1735102375.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

For anyone who cares to hear the series of unfortunate events: 

Originally I planned to make regular cream puffs (filled with the vanilla pastry cream and dipped in chocolate) and then tiramisu inspired cream puffs (filled with a mascarpone cream and dipped in the brown butter coffee caramel sauce). 

I made the vanilla pastry cream, the caramel sauce, and the custard for the mascarpone cream yesterday (but didn’t mix in the mascarpone yet because the recipe instructed me not to until I was ready to use the cream). All went well.

This morning I made the choux. My first batch deflated when I took it out of the oven. Second batch was piped way too big and I forgot to add salt (I put these in the freezer to save for later personal use). Finally, my third and fourth batch turned out great! 

But then, unfortunately, after I added the mascarpone to the custard, I tried it and realized it tasted off. The date on the cheese was fine (April 2025) but I smelled it and it didn’t smell quite right. So I decided to toss it. 

In the end, I just decided to do vanilla pastry cream filling and dip them all in the coffee caramel sauce. Didn’t even want to mess with the chocolate at this point lol. Honestly though, it all ended up working out great 😊 Trying to do 2 different style cream puffs was doing too much for the limited time I had. ",6,1735102219.0,Baking,2,0.81,False

I decided that in order to overcome my limerence, I need to make myself available to others. I need to go out and do things. I'm not going to stay home and wallow in my sorrow - I'm a reasonably attractive person, I have a good career, I am financially stable and healthy. I might still have a chance. Trouble is, it gets really frustrating.

**I went to two singles picnics so far.** One had \*some\* people my age, but none of them were as interesting and fun to talk to as my LO. It was boring. I gave myself credit for getting out of the house and trying.

The second picnic was worse: everyone was at least 20 years older than me (despite the fact that the ad said it's for my age group). I sat there for an hour, and had the exact same small talk with four different people: what do I do for work, do I have pets, which part of town do I live in, where's my accent from etc. Bored. So bored.

I paid a total of $50 of Uber rides to these things.

**I went on dating apps.** **People on dating apps are even MORE boring.** Everyone likes to hit the gym, they ""love to laugh"" or ""like having fun"" (tautology). They like to travel and watch Netflix. It's like the same person over and over again, but with a different picture every time. I noticed that many men with strong political opinions about social justice also check the box next to ""casual sex"" or ""intimacy without commitment"" on all these apps - their supposedly strong moral compass does not extend to their personal life somehow.

Most of them are time-wasters, who'd chat and chat online pointlessly, till they eventually fade away into oblivion, without ever suggesting we grab a coffee together in person.  
I met with a couple of people, and nothing was wrong with them, but it just wasn't it.

The courtroom adjourned shortly after lunch, the weight of the day’s arguments pressing heavy on my chest. Judge Carradine’s gavel came down with a decisive crack, signaling the end of another exhausting session.

“All parties are dismissed until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,” she announced, her tone neutral.

I gathered my files with mechanical precision, studiously ignoring Luigi’s gaze. I could feel it on me, piercing and deliberate, as though he were trying to say something without words. I didn’t give him the satisfaction of looking back.

By the time I got home, the sun had sunk low in the sky, painting my living room in dusky shades of gold and gray. I kicked off my heels at the door, letting out a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.

Home was supposed to be my sanctuary, the one place where I could drop the carefully constructed facade I wore for the rest of the world. But tonight, even in the comfort of my own space, I felt unsettled.

I poured myself a glass of wine, hoping the ritual would calm my racing thoughts. As I sat on the couch, my mind wandered back to the courtroom—to Luigi. His penetrating stare, his disarming words, the way he seemed to peel back layers I hadn’t even realized I’d built.

He was dangerous. Not in the way the prosecution claimed, but in a way that felt far more personal.

The shrill ring of my phone shattered the silence, and I nearly spilled my wine. I glanced at the screen, my stomach tightening when I saw his name.

Luigi Mangione.

I debated letting it go to voicemail. It was late, and nothing good could come from this conversation. But curiosity—and maybe something darker—compelled me to answer.

“What is it?” I said, trying to keep my voice even.

“You sound tense,” he said, his tone low and velvety.

“It’s been a long day,” I replied curtly. “What do you need, Mr. Mangione?”

“Luigi,” he corrected, a hint of amusement coloring his words. “And what I need is to meet. Tonight.”

I closed my eyes, pinching the bridge of my nose. “We have a full team for strategy sessions, as you well know. Anything that needs discussing can wait until tomorrow morning.”

“This can’t wait,” he said, his voice taking on a sharper edge. “It’s about the case. I wouldn’t call if it wasn’t important.”

There was something in his tone that made me hesitate. Urgency, yes, but also a thread of vulnerability I hadn’t expected. Against my better judgment, I relented.

“Fine,” I said. “Where?”

“Arrange a Counselor meeting at the jail,” he said smoothly. 

“No,” I said quickly. “We’ll meet at the office. Neutral ground.”

There was a pause, and for a moment, I thought he might argue. But then he said, “As you wish.”

I hung up, tossing the phone onto the coffee table.

The wine sat untouched as I changed into something less formal—a simple blouse and dark jeans. Still professional enough to assert boundaries, but comfortable enough to remind myself I was in control.

Or so I told myself.

As I drove to the office, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was walking into something more than just a late-night strategy session.

And deep down, I wasn’t sure if I was dreading it… or looking forward to it.

The office was eerily quiet this late at night, the usual hum of activity reduced to the occasional groan of the air conditioning unit. I stepped into the conference room, setting my bag on the polished table. Luigi was already there, leaning casually against the far wall, his tailored shirt unbuttoned at the collar.

“Miss Harper,” he said, his lips curling into that infuriatingly confident smile.

“Let’s keep this brief,” I replied, ignoring the way his gaze traveled over me. “What was so urgent it couldn’t wait until morning?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he walked toward me with the slow, deliberate stride of a predator sizing up its prey.

“You should know,” he said, his voice low, “that I don’t choose people lightly.”

“Excuse me?” I asked, narrowing my eyes.

“For my defense team,” he clarified, though his tone suggested he meant far more than that. “I could’ve hired anyone. The best, the most renowned.”

“And yet here I am,” I said, crossing my arms.

“Exactly,” he said, his gaze dropping briefly to the curve of my shoulders before returning to my face. “Because you’re different. Unyielding. A fortress.”

“You mean difficult,” I said flatly.

His smile deepened. “I mean intriguing.”

I rolled my eyes, but before I could respond, he stepped closer, close enough that I could feel the heat radiating off him. He reached out, his fingers brushing against my temple before sliding into my hair.

“Do you ever let anyone in, Alex?” he asked, his voice soft and disarming.

I stiffened, grabbing his wrist and pulling his hand away. “This isn’t happening, Luigi. I’m your lawyer, not a thrill.”

His chuckle was low and throaty. “I’m not trying to conquer you. I just want to understand you.”

“Well, stop,” I said, stepping back. “We have work to do, or I’m leaving.”

He watched me for a moment, then nodded, the intensity in his eyes dimming slightly.

“Fine,” he said, taking a seat at the head of the table. “But first, humor me.”

I hesitated, then sat down across from him.

“In court tomorrow,” he said, leaning forward, “wear that navy dress. The one with the sharp neckline.”

I frowned. “You don’t get to dictate my wardrobe.”

“It’s not a demand,” he said, his tone softer now. “It’s strategy. You command attention in that dress. And I need the jury’s eyes on you, not me.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Flattery won’t get you anywhere.”

“It’s not flattery,” he said. “It’s the truth. You walk into a room, and people notice. I noticed.”

I looked away, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks. “Why did you really choose me, Luigi?”

His gaze softened, and for a moment, he seemed almost vulnerable.

“Because you don’t just fight for your clients,” he said. “You fight for yourself. I saw it in the way you argued your cases, the way you held your ground. I need that kind of fire.”

I didn’t know what to say to that.

The silence stretched between us, heavy and charged, until I finally stood. “We’re done here,” I said, grabbing my bag.

But as I turned to leave, his voice stopped me.

“Tomorrow,” he said, “wear the dress. And let your hair down. You might be surprised at the effect it has.”

I didn’t respond, walking out without looking back. But as I drove home, his words lingered in my mind, taunting me.

What was he trying to do? And why, despite everything, did part of me want to let him?

------------

Luigi leaned back in his chair at the defendant’s table, his hands folded casually in front of him, though his heart beat with anything but ease. The moment Alexandra stepped into the courtroom, his body tensed like a wire pulled taut.

She wore the navy dress.

It fit her perfectly, skimming her body in a way that was both elegant and maddeningly provocative. The neckline framed her collarbone like a piece of art, and her dark hair fell in soft waves down her shoulders, catching the light with every subtle movement.

He couldn’t take his eyes off her.

She moved with purpose, her heels clicking against the polished floor, commanding attention from the jury, the judge, everyone in the room. But it wasn’t just the dress or her stride. It was the fire in her eyes, the sharp precision of her focus.

God help him, it wasn’t just the way she looked—it was her presence.

Alexandra was untouchable, a fortress of intellect and power, and yet here she was, fighting for him.

He shifted in his seat, his pulse quickening as she took her place at the podium. Her voice rang out, smooth and authoritative, as she dismantled the prosecutor’s argument piece by piece. He watched her lips move, the sharp curve of her jaw tightening when she made a particularly biting remark.

He could hardly breathe.

The courtroom faded around him, the dull murmurs of the spectators, the clatter of a pen dropping—it all dissolved into a haze. All he could focus on was her. The way her hand gripped the edge of the podium as she leaned into her argument, the fire in her eyes as she dared the jury to disagree.

She wasn’t just defending him; she was owning the room.

And it drove him insane.

He felt the heat stir in his chest and sink lower, his body responding in ways he wished it wouldn’t. He shifted in his seat again, willing himself to focus on the trial, the charges, anything but the sight of Alexandra standing there like a goddess carved from stone.

But it was impossible.

Her voice rang in his ears, and his gaze dipped to her throat, watching the delicate movement as she spoke. He clenched his fists under the table, a quiet war raging in his mind.

He wanted her.

Not just physically—though every nerve in his body screamed for her touch—but completely. He wanted to crack open that fortress, to see what lay beneath all those layers of professionalism and defiance. He wanted to know her, to consume her, to have her willingly fall into his orbit.

She finished her argument with a flourish, turning on her heel and walking back toward him. Luigi’s breath caught as her eyes briefly met his, a flicker of something unspoken passing between them.

She sat down beside him, her perfume lingering in the air—a soft, subtle scent that only fueled his desire. He leaned toward her, unable to help himself.

“You’re a vision, Alexandra,” he murmured, his voice low enough for only her to hear.

“Focus,” she snapped back, not looking at him. “This isn’t about you.”

But her cheeks betrayed her, a faint pink coloring her otherwise composed face.

He smirked, his voice soft and teasing. “Oh, but it is.”

She shot him a glare, and Luigi leaned back, pleased with the way her sharp retort only fueled his obsession.

As the session wore on, he remained fixated, his thoughts dark and consuming. He wanted to run his fingers through her hair, to press her against the cold walls of the courthouse and feel her resistance melt.

But she was a fortress.

And he would take his time breaking through.",1,1735102138.0,u_LsUmIuGtI,0,1.0,False

1hlty8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1hlty8x/it_keeps_fucking_happening/,It keeps fucking happening,"TW: transphobia

My partner and I are trans. Both FtM, so to his transphobic parents, we're sinners whose lesbian lifestyle will condemn us to hell. His parents have held the illusion that is southern politeness for four years, now. I compliment their cooking, I wait to eat AFTER joining hands and saying grace. I sit through hours of them deadnaming and misgendering him to keep the fucking peace. I forgave his father when he told my deadname to my partner's grandmother even as she called me only that until she died. I said nothing and held polite conversation in the living room while an article titled, ""Inside the Transgender Empire"" sat right in front of me on their coffee table.

I didn't swear. I called them Mr. and Mrs.[LAST NAME]. I hugged them, I listened and remained a civil, active listener. I kept my head down because my partner so desperately wants to believe that they would come around and finally accept him. I wasn't going to ruin his relationship with them even when I personally wish it would burn to the ground already.

When my partner wanted to announce our engagement two years ago, I knew how it'd go. His mother cried, his father looked disgusted and refused to look me in the eye. He told us point blank he couldn't be happy for us. I excused myself and cried privately outside. I kept coming over for holiday dinners. I never held his hand in front of them or kissed him. I didn't call him by name or use his pronouns. I did every disgusting compromise there was for their fragile sensibilities. So did he. 

When my partner wanted to introduce me as his fiance to his extended family at the shitty christian lodge where they held their reunion, I supported him. When I was laughed at when introduced, and when my partner brushed it off saying, ""That's just aunt ____. She didn't mean anything by it."", I shoved the hurt down. I sat through morning devotionals while his shitty uncle preached about how changing the body god gave you is narcissistic and sinful. 

When his father audibly showed disapproval and anger every time I was introduced, my partner said there wasn't a problem until someone said something to his face. I let his father call us friends to family and in his home. 

He's cried so many fucking nights about them not accepting him. I tried not to give him false hope while also saying ""maybe"" because we've discussed no-contact solutions before and that's just not what he wants. I've supported him even when he's slowly fucking killing himself, waiting for love that will never ever ever come from these pious shitheads that adopted him.

Even though I personally want these fuckwits out of his life for sending him to conversion camps in his youth, for being antivax, antimedical, morons, I set that aside for his sake because he loves them and wants them in his life. They don't deserve to be. 

Well, guess where we went for Christmas eve. He signed their gifts with his name. His mother said, ""To mom, from--"" then just opened it. His father went, ""[Name]? I don't know any [name]. I know a [deadname].""

His brother addressed us as a couple and his father slammed something. He was short with me all night.

I waited in the car, my partner wanted to talk to his dad in private and directly ask of he'd come to our wedding. He said no, he wasn't interested, something I had been trying to tell him was expressed when we announced the engagement, but that he didn't accept because it wasn't explicitly stated. We left, he cried, saying he thought they would change. I knew they wouldn't. They love him, but only when he behaves as the daughter they want him to be. Their love is conditional. It's a fragile veneer that my partner refuses to see because he wants their love so badly he'll prune who he is to fit in their shitty box.

I hate them. I hate them. I hate tolerating them. I hate their ignorance and selfishness. I hate their passive aggressive comments, I hate their trump apologism, that they cower behind religion and pass judgement as if their stupid little book doesn't expressly say only god can do that. My partner puts them on a pedestal because they bought him art supplies to support his art hobby and help paid for car troubles. Then laughs off the rest of his childhood experiences of being a sheltered, shamed, repressed failure to them.

All this ass-kissing, tiptoeing, having to pretend like we're not being looked at like confused degenerates. FUCK THEM.

They chose, literally CHOSE to raise him and love him. They're not holy people, they're ignorant, entitled losers. They don't deserve his love. They don't deserve him. They don't deserve the light he brings everywhere he goes, and to their god all I pray for is that he finally, finally, realizes that these people have hurt him and will NEVER change. That he has to let them go or distance himself. I'm sick of watching him get his hopes up. He didn't fail them, THEY failed him.",1,1735102103.0,venting,1,0.99,False
1hlty4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hlty4l/strange_cardiac_event/,Strange Cardiac Event,"I (30M) was carrying heavy boxes into my parents’ new house yesterday when I suddenly felt short of breath. I leaned against a counter and felt my heart start pounding extremely hard and fast. I was panting and flushed. Then after about 10 seconds something really weird happened: the pounding very suddenly stopped and I felt my heart give 2-3 very slow, hard beats then stop (at least that’s what it felt like). I blacked out and collapsed. 

When I came to maybe 30 seconds later (I’m not sure I even fully lost consciousness) my heart felt like it was beating totally normally. Today I have some slight pain in my chest (almost like a soreness) but mainly just tons of anxiety because I don’t know what happened and what I should do. 

I took a couple ECGs on my wife’s Apple Watch that were normal. BP is fine. I don’t normally work out and had had a large amount of coffee that morning.

1hltx7a,https://i.redd.it/a5r2cw80dx8e1.jpeg,Finished Cowboy Bebop. Wow.,"I’m in absolute tears. I was not expecting it to end the way it did. This post will contain [SPOILERS!]. When I started this anime 7 days ago, I was expecting it to be just any other ordinary show, especially with only 26 episodes. However, I was wrong. I was captivated from the ending of the first episode, when Katerina finally realized her dream was futile and killed Asimov! The way the story unfolds—with its mix of humor, action, and heartache—is something I’ve rarely seen in such a short series. It’s better written than anime with over a hundred episodes. The show really takes its time to develop each character, giving something unique to every one of them. None of the episodes felt dull.

My favorite character is Faye, and Grin as well. Her backstory was honestly heartbreaking and the most interesting to me. There were episodes that really had me hooked because her story was just so compelling. And Grin, though short-lived, I loved him—he deserved way better. All the characters were great; those two just stood out the most to me. Spike, Jet, and RADICAL EDWARD were fantastic too. Ed, she’s so adorable and extremely likable. I just love her! I was so sad to see her go. And don’t think I forgot Ein; I missed him too, but at least he’s with Ed wherever they are. Their bond was so cute!

The last two episodes, which primarily focus on Spike, were really good and had me hooked the entire time. The episode that focused on Jet had me hooked too, especially the one with him and Fad.

The soundtrack deserves a special mention as well. It’s almost like another character in the show, setting the tone and enhancing the emotion of every scene. It complements the story perfectly, making every high and low feel even more intense. The cinematography and animation? Wow. Each shot was so intentional and meticulously crafted. It made me appreciate the visual artistry behind the anime in ways I didn’t expect. There’s just something about anime that no live-action show or movie could ever replicate. I’m not sure what it is, but it’s what I love about anime.

Jupiter Jazz Parts 1 & 2 were my favorite episodes—you probably saw my post about them a few days ago! There were a lot of other cool characters that I wish we’d seen more of, like Coffee from Mushroom Samba, the seventeenth episode. And others that I liked but died too quickly.

I won’t say any more; I just really enjoyed the show. I wasn’t expecting it to hit me this hard. I just don’t know what else to say. You guys probably understand how I’m feeling right now. There’s so much I want to mention, but I just can’t put it into words. I just loved the show. Overall, Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece.

For anyone who cares to hear the series of unfortunate events: 

Originally I planned to make regular cream puffs (filled with the vanilla pastry cream and dipped in chocolate) and then tiramisu inspired cream puffs (filled with a mascarpone cream and dipped in the brown butter coffee caramel sauce). 

I made the vanilla pastry cream, the caramel sauce, and the custard for the mascarpone cream yesterday (but didn’t mix in the mascarpone yet because the recipe instructed me not to until I was ready to use the cream). All went well.

This morning I made the choux. My first batch deflated when I took it out of the oven. Second batch was piped way too big and I forgot to add salt (I put these in the freezer to save for later personal use). Finally, my third and fourth batch turned out great! 

But then, unfortunately, after I added the mascarpone to the custard, I tried it and realized it tasted off. The date on the cheese was fine (April 2025) but I smelled it and it didn’t smell quite right. So I decided to toss it. 

In the end, I just decided to do vanilla pastry cream filling and dip them all in the coffee caramel sauce. Didn’t even want to mess with the chocolate at this point lol. Honestly though, it all ended up working out great 😊 Trying to do 2 different style cream puffs was doing too much for the limited time I had. ",6,1735101853.0,pastry,0,1.0,False

I'm trying to narrow everything down to make sure I minimize the space I'll be taking up, and trying to figure out what furniture is best to take. (Currently planning on a dresser, fold up mattress, coffee table that doubles as storage and a laptop stand, small shelf for lighter items, fold-up desk, under-desk treadmill, and a fold-up three-shelf cart with wheels.) 

I of course have clothes I'll need space for, as well as food (I'll most likely need to store most of it in my room), and art supplies (career choice, not just a hobby). 

I'd really appreciate help trying to figure out what would work best for this room. I'm worried about me feeling claustrophobic, I want to avoid that at all costs. (Also, hence why I'm planning on taking so much furniture that has the potential to fold up and move out of the way.) 

I struggle with scarcity mindset and I'm not sure what makes most sense to try to narrow my stuff down to. I'm trying to maximize the stuff I bring, so I'm taking for example clothes and art supplies that mostly can be super compacted (excluding for example a winter coat, which, where I'm moving, I believe that's a necessity).

Idk if i have ppd, r/paranoia is too inactive to ask in, but by that I mean things like ""a person started walking after i looked at a door to an army/recruiter related room on campus"".  revisited as ""that person thought I was up to no good and started to follow me to see if i would do anything bad. they stopped following me when I returned"".

Or ""i percieved that parts of my hair randomly were lightening or my skin had lighter spots and my skin itched some/became red(likely dryness)"", revisited later as ""I think someone is putting something like nair into the soap and maybe I was right and someone is putting bleaching products into my shampoo"". Maybe its not paranoia cause i can think my way out of it, and im aware its irrational/not possible without extreme physical issues.

But also lately ive revisited some ideas I had, and realized they were unfounded, cant come up with examples, but my brain has tried to take me down some weird trips... (like familly performing some social experiment on me), or trying to sabotage my college progress(the truth is the exact opposite).

Also how often do you drink coffee? Cause I think the earliest thing I remember that couldve been paranoia ish was around when I started drinking coffee... i.e. thinking people were keeping some secret or someone secretely was related to another person and hiding it, ect. But i think it helps with my adhd issues if i drink it sparingly. So its a double edged sword.

Too much coffee/not enough sleep(i havent pulled all nighters in a while), ect and it just goes off the rails into ""hey i think someone has access to my thoughts"" or ""i think the sound thats just some normal sound is from someone making plans to harm me"".

So I have 3 cats. One is from a shelter, she is a sweetie and does NOT try to eat my food. She shows no interest and I can eat on the couch next to her and she does not care.

The other two uggghhh (I love them but I am struggling). They were barn cats as kittens and now are house cats after I adopted them. I feed them morning and night, a mix of wet and dry. You would not know this, you'd think they were starving. If I am setting the table for dinner I cannot leave to get a glass of water before they are up on that table eating my food. Leave it on the counter while I get something from the fridge, forget it, they are up there trying to eat it. We have to put something heavy over the trash can in the kitchen because they rummage through it making a HUUUGe mess. I like to eat on the couch but I cannot because they both jump on me and try to eat it while I'm eating it. I can push them off 16 times and they will keep coming. Same at the dinner table, I have to lock them in the other room or they will be climbing up the back of my chair and leaning over me trying to eat it. I can lock them in there cause they have a litter box and play space there, but I don't WANT to constantly lock my cats out of the room. I want them to wander the house freely and behave. They are ANNOYING me to no end lol.

I've tried repeatedly lifting them and putting them down. Does not work. Saying NO loudly and then putting them down. Does not work. Flicking the ear. Does not work, and I don't like doing it. I am at my wits end. What do I dooooo. Squirt gun? I don't want to have to have one in every room.

1hltl09,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hltl09/costa_rica_nuevo_arenal/,Costa Rica - Nuevo Arenal ,"We stayed at a hotel named La Mansion Arenal overlooking the Arenal Lake. It was absolutely gorgeous. They are suites that are basically little homes separated from each other. The suites are big and gorgeous. They are traditional pueblo styled and are not fancy high tech suites like in your Hiltons and Marriott's. If you want the real Costa Rican experience this is the place for you. Breakfast is included and offer traditional and American style breakfasts. However the con is that the hotel is up a mountain so Ubers are hard to get and taxis are expensive. We got lucky because a shuttle tour bus stopped and they were able to get us to the city La Fortuna. The same driver asked us about our plans for the rest of trip and provided contacts and his wife who does uber to transport us. Most of the tour guides and shuttle services know people who can transport people to their destinations so make sure to talk to your drivers or tour guides to get transportation locked in if you will stay here. 

La Fortuna is about 45 min away from here and many of the tours offered are in or around La Fortuna. I recommend Viator as a website to use for tours just make sure to read reviews. We went to the Rainforest Chocolate Tour near La Fortuna and it was very educational and plenty of cacao to eat and so delicious. If you want to buy chocolate I recommend doing it from chocolate tours because it's cheaper than most places and have plenty of selection. We also did a sloth tour near La Fortuna as well. They are knowledgeable and will take you exactly where the sloths are. Insect spray is key as well in the rainforest, just make sure to reapply. 

I put a packing list in my other post titled Costa Rica - Jaco if you need suggestions on what to pack. Most important things are insect repellent and lots of underwear as it is very hot/humid and you will likely shower often. We went in December and it was raining a bit but still very hot. 

La Fortuna is safe and have police officers in cars and walking on foot all around. I suggest 10pm being the latest to stay there. They have plenty of restaurants and souvenir shops. 

Things to take back home are La Lizano which is an amazing salsa. A variety of chocolate and coffee. Britt is a good brand for both chocolate and coffee but it's nice to try a variety. ",3,1735100518.0,travel,3,0.67,False
