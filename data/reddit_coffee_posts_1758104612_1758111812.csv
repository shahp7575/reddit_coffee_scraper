1njbk6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njbk6m/i_27f_think_my_partner_29m_is_emotionally_abusive/,I (27F) think my partner (29M) is emotionally abusive,"So for context ive been with my partner around 19 months just shy of our 2 year mark. Everything in the beginning was lovely he did everything right said the right things. We moved in together and have lived together just over a year. In this time he keeps quitting his jobs putting the financial burden on me to pay the bills while hes inbetween work which can last months. The last time he quit he was fully expecting me to pay all the bills and do all the housework as he was depressed. I got him into therapy and hes now on medication for depression and doing a lot better but at this time he had no desire to work again and just decided without asking me that i was gonna support us and all he was gonna do was smoke weed and play computer games. He also fully expected me to pay for his weed and i stated i wasn‚Äôt going to do that which made him get another job once he realised i wasn‚Äôt funding his drug habit.

Since starting the new job, he keeps saying he‚Äôs too tired to help me with house jobs and i should do them because i work in a office and can work from home twice a week and he works in a kitchen. I tried to talk to him about how i was getting run down working full time, doing all the house work and looking after 5 cats but he decided to tell me he‚Äôll pay me money instead of listening to my feelings and acknowledging how burnt out i am from having to do everything.

So the emotional abuse. Theres things he says to me that is making me feel emotionally neglected in this relationship and every time i try to bring up something i don‚Äôt like he accuses me of ‚Äòstarting an argument‚Äô so that ill shut up or he turns it around on me and blames me and makes me feel horrible instead. Heres some things ive kept a list of in the last two weeks thats he‚Äôs said and done to me.

1.  forgot i said i was going to my friends house, i said to him ‚Äúi did tell you‚Äù he started going off on how i was being snarky turned it around on me and said i should know how to speak to people considering how i grew up with my mam (my mam was physically abusive for my entire childhood until i left home.)

I told him about my past in confidence and he threw it back in my face to hurt me and laughed it off like a joke just because he didnt like the way i said something.

2. Poured energy drink on me while i was in the bath just to get a reaction and he laughed at me when i was clearly agitated by it

3. Didnt want to hear about my day as it didnt involve him so didnt concern him and he doesnt like my friend so was only asking to be polite but wasnt actually interested (his exact words). this happens a lot and now i dont feel like i can even speak to him as i know hes not interested unless the conversation revolves around him but he complains to me saying im too quiet.

4. Cannot have opinions around him as he always disagrees with me to make him seem smarter. Sick of not being able to express my true thoughts and opinions not that he cares anyway

5. have to always watch what i say around him especially my tone of voice as he verbally attacks me when he doesn‚Äôt like it

6. I do all the house work and work full time. All he does is smoke weed and play games on days off and after work.
He makes me wake him up every morning and i expects me to have his morning coffee ready every day. Most times i dont even get a good morning all he says is ‚Äúwheres my coffee?‚Äù

7. We‚Äôre not intimate hardly ever at all. We have sex once a month and usually only for his gratification and i feel unsatisfied and used by the end of it. Theres love or connection in the act. 

8. Challenged me for being low, said if i have depression i need to sort it out as hes not sitting with a depressed girlfriend who wont talk 

This one hits harder as i helped him through his mental health and he made me feel like mine is a problem he cant be bothered with

9. He threw a chair at the wall and out a hole in it because i said i didnt want to play computer games with him. At the time he asked i was busy cleaning the flat which he jabbed at me saying was dirty and he had no clothes to wear so i was cleaning and doing laundry 

I know when i type this is emotional abuse but he brushes it off and acts like it never happened and feel like im going crazy imagining it but my feelings are real and im not being supported emotionally like i need to be

1njbikj,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1njbikj/28_f_doing_phd_in_ai_feel_like_im_wasting_my_life/,"28 F, doing PhD in Ai & feel like i'm wasting my life any day not doing Music","I seriously don't know what I should be doing as a career...  
I love nothing more than I love music. I sing and play acoustic guitar. As I kid, I used to do music, theater, dance, jewelries, drawing, storytelling, photography, everything. Also as a teenager, I was very curious to learn about biology, geography, philosophy, anatomy, languages; things that made sense in real world and life.

But unfortunately, I was also academically very successful at even the subjects that I don't care about (math, physics). Ended up in one of the best high schools in the country. At this point I should mention that I'm from Turkey where the academic pressure is very high, and other peoples opinion matter immensely.

Not explicitly but, at the end of high school, I had to choose between being an engineer vs a doctor. I thought being an engineer would give me a bit more time to myself after work & weekends, so I ended up studying something that I hated but still good at it.

Didn't want to work as an engineer so i left to Portugal to study something ""softer"" aka a masters degree on data science and ended up publishing my thesis. I taught at the uni for 3 years and loved it so much. Interacting with the students was amazing as opposed to doing research on my laptop. Every class I taught was a performance for me. I loved my teaching persona. This misled me to think that I wanted to be a Prof at the university. I started a PhD in Ai in Italy where I am now. It is actually going good cause I am a responsible person in nature so I keep publishing (I actually love giving presentations at conferences, it makes me happy -not because of the topic though, i love the act of presenting-) and researching.

But there isn't a single day that I think I am living a life defying my nature. I am not a scientist or engineer in my soul. I have always been an artist. But I lost all my creativity while studying non stop.

I am still singing, playing, choir-ing, dancing. But just as hobbies. I had a band in high school, some tiny concerts. I also performed solo in coffee shops, bars, open mics and received many compliments. I always promised myself to record myself -the last 15 years!!!-, share on YouTube, Instagram, whatever, but always something got in the way or I thought I was not good enough or I had depression (I had 3 major depressions in the last 10 years).

Now, I am too into the PhD to quit (also I need the scholarship money)(also what would I say to my parents, they worked too hard to support my education), don't have any technical music education and not good enough at music; so I'm just stuck.

I cried over million times thinking I should have done everything, anything else, except what I'm doing. I could teach languages, I could do a PhD in something exciting, meaningful, I could be a musician, I could do musicals, I even thought au pair or cleaning! I feel better cleaning my house than coming to work every day.

I keep telling myself, once I get my PhD, I'll turn my life around but what does that even mean? I don't want to end up with a wasted life in the sense of it was lived in a way that wasn't right to my existence/personality/soul. I don't know what subreddit is the right place to talk about this but this is my situation at the moment...

TLDR; I feel I'm doing something not compatible with me but I also feel like I cannot change it and don't know how or to what... ",1,1758111418.0,careeradvice,1,1.0,False

As this community continues to grow and thrive, I've noticed a great mix of members‚Äîfrom veterans with decades of experience to people who just bought their very first ""real"" bottle. It's a fantastic dynamic, but it can also mean that some of our discussions are full of jargon that might leave newcomers a little lost. And let's be honest, it's a lot to ask of our experts to explain every single term every single time.

So, I wanted to start a project for us all: a comprehensive, ever-growing glossary of fragrance terms. This isn't just a list I'm creating; it's a living document for all of us, by all of us. Think of it as our collective knowledge base, a friendly place to learn the language of scent.

I've laid the groundwork with some key terms below. My goal is to keep updating this post as new terms come up and as we refine our definitions. If you want to know what a ""blind buy"" is or what ""sillage"" means, this is the spot.

I truly believe this will be a valuable resource for everyone. Please, jump into the comments! Suggest terms I missed, offer better explanations, or simply let me know what you'd like to see added.

Let's build this together!

# ____________________________________________________________________________

# A

* **Absolute:** A highly concentrated, oily fragrance material extracted from a plant using a solvent. Absolutes are often used for delicate flowers like jasmine or rose because the extraction method is gentle and preserves their true scent.
* **Accord:** The fundamental ""building block"" of a perfume. It is a harmonious blend of two or more individual fragrance notes that, when combined, create a new, distinct scent (e.g., a ""leather accord"" or a ""gourmand accord"").
* **Aldehydes:** A class of organic compounds used in perfumery that can create a waxy, sparkly, or clean scent. They are often described as having a ""lifting"" effect on a fragrance and are famously featured in perfumes like Chanel No. 5.
* **Amber:** A warm, sweet, and resinous scent, often a blend of ingredients like labdanum, benzoin, and vanilla. It is a popular base note that provides a rich and deep foundation.
* **Ambergris:** A rare, waxy substance produced by sperm whales. It has a complex, marine, and musky aroma and is highly valued as a fixative. Modern perfumes use synthetic versions.
* **Animalic:** A term for scents that evoke smells reminiscent of animals. These can be musky, leathery, or even fecal, and are used in small doses to add depth, sensuality, and longevity.
* **Aromatic:** A fragrance family or note category that includes herbs like lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. They often have a fresh, green, and slightly medicinal quality and are very common in Foug√®re fragrances.

# B

* **Balsamic:** A term to describe a warm, resinous, and rich scent. Notes like vanilla, benzoin, and frankincense are considered balsamic.
* **Base Notes:** The final layer of a fragrance to develop. These are the heaviest, longest-lasting notes that form the scent's foundation and can linger for hours. Examples include vetiver, musk, and sandalwood.
* **Benzoin:** A balsamic resin from the bark of the Styrax tree. It has a sweet, warm, and vanillic scent and is often used as a fixative.
* **Bergamot:** A citrus note from the rind of a bergamot orange. It has a bright, tart, and slightly spicy aroma and is a key note in many Chypre and Foug√®re fragrances.
* **Blind Buy:** The act of purchasing a perfume without ever having smelled it, often based on online reviews, notes lists, or the bottle's design.
* **Blotter:** A strip of absorbent paper used to test a fragrance. It is a crucial tool for perfumers and enthusiasts to smell a scent's true development over time.
* **Body Mist:** A very light fragrance, with a concentration of 1-3% fragrance oils. It is less concentrated and less expensive than a cologne.

# C

* **Calone:** A synthetic molecule that imparts a fresh, ozonic, and aquatic scent reminiscent of a sea breeze or melon. It was heavily used in 1990s aquatic fragrances.
* **Castoreum:** An animalic note from beavers that has a deep, leathery, and smoky aroma. Modern perfumery uses synthetic versions.
* **Cedarwood:** A common woody note with a dry, pencil-shaving-like scent.
* **Chypre:** A classic fragrance family characterized by a three-part accord: a citrus top (like bergamot), a floral heart, and a mossy-woody base (typically oakmoss and patchouli).
* **Civet:** A traditional animalic note derived from the civet cat. It has a pungent, fecal smell in its pure form but adds a warm, sensual, and musky quality when diluted. Modern versions are always synthetic.
* **Clove:** A spice note with a warm, spicy, and aromatic scent.
* **Cologne:** A fragrance with a low concentration of aromatic compounds, typically around 2-4%. It is light and refreshing, with a short longevity.
* **Concentration:** The ratio of fragrance oil to alcohol in a perfume. The higher the concentration, the more potent and longer-lasting the scent.
* **Coumarin:** An aromatic chemical that smells like freshly cut hay, vanilla, or almonds. It is a key ingredient in Foug√®re fragrances.
* **Cypriol (Nagarmotha):** A woody note with a smoky, earthy, and leathery scent, often used as an alternative to oud.

# D

* **Decant:** A small sample of a fragrance, typically poured from a larger bottle into a smaller vial. Decants are a popular way to test a scent before committing to a full bottle.
* **Designer Fragrance:** Perfumes produced by major fashion houses or brands (e.g., Dior, Chanel, Gucci). They are typically mass-marketed and widely available.
* **Distillation (Steam Distillation):** A common method of extracting essential oils from plants. Steam is passed through the plant material, and the resulting vapor is cooled and condensed, separating the fragrant oil from the water.
* **Dry Down:** The final and longest-lasting phase of a fragrance‚Äôs development on the skin. This is where the base notes are most prominent.

# E

* **Eau de Cologne (EDC):** A fragrance concentration with a very low percentage of perfume oil, typically 2-4%. It is light, refreshing, and short-lived.
* **Eau de Parfum (EDP):** A fragrance concentration with a higher percentage of perfume oil, typically 15-20%. It offers a good balance of projection and longevity.
* **Eau de Toilette (EDT):** A fragrance concentration with a moderate percentage of perfume oil, typically 5-15%. It is lighter than an EDP and great for a more subtle scent.
* **Enfleurage:** A traditional, labor-intensive method of extracting fragrance from delicate flowers using odorless fats to absorb the scent. Modern perfumery rarely uses this method.
* **Essential Oil:** A concentrated, volatile aroma compound obtained from plants through methods like distillation or expression.
* **Expression (Cold Pressing):** A method of extracting oils, especially from citrus fruits, by pressing the rinds to release the fragrant oils.
* **Extrait de Parfum:** The most concentrated form of a fragrance, typically 20-40% perfume oil. It provides the greatest longevity and a more intimate sillage.

# F

* **Family:** A classification system for perfumes, grouping them by their shared scent characteristics (e.g., Floral, Woody, Oriental).
* **Flanker:** A new fragrance that is a variation of an existing, popular scent. It often shares the original's name but adds a new note or theme (e.g., ""XYZ Intense"" or ""XYZ Summer"").
* **Fixative:** An ingredient used in a perfume to reduce the evaporation rate of other fragrance materials, making the scent last longer. Common fixatives include woods, resins, and musks.
* **Floral:** A broad fragrance family that features notes from flowers like rose, jasmine, lily of the valley, and tuberose.
* **Fougere:** A classic fragrance family, primarily for men, built on an accord of lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin (a hay-like scent). It is often described as fresh, clean, and masculine.
* **Frankincense:** A resin from the Boswellia tree with a smoky, spicy, and woody aroma.

# G

Prior to our office move, I was making hot coffee at work, but since I started purchasing due to no kitchen sink or counter, I've gotten into iced lattes which I've found I like a lot more. To try and save money, I recently bought a cold brew pitcher and have attempted making coffee at home. But the flavor is kind of strange to me. I did buy a cold brew from the coffee shop the other day to compare and found it has the same flavor that is just not hitting right. 

For those of you who have tried different ratios, different brands, etc, is there just that unique cold brew flavor regardless because it is inherent to cold brew (possibly the acid from hot brewing is the part that I like?) Or do you find that changing things up impacts that flavor significantly? 

I am contemplating getting an espresso machine at some point if I just can't get myself to like the cold brew or just sticking with mushroom coffee because I do enjoy that, as well. My fiance also finds the cold brew flavor to be slightly off, so perhaps it is just a reality of cold brew has a unique flavor that you either like or don't like. But, if there are experts who can tell me if there's some changes to try, I am all for that since I already spent the money on a pitcher!",1,1758110867.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False
1njbakh,https://www.reddit.com/r/compassionatecuts/comments/1njbakh/expanding_our_homeless_outreach/,Expanding our homeless outreach,"Over the past few weeks, while completing my mid-month finances as usual, I‚Äôve noticed something very clear: with our regular visits to Belfast for outreach and meetings, travel costs have almost doubled compared to what they used to be.

I want to be clear‚ÄîI‚Äôm not complaining. If I had the energy and the funds, I would be out on outreach every single night of the week. Meeting people where they are, offering kindness, a haircut, a hygiene pack, or even just a listening ear‚Äîthis is at the heart of what we do. But the reality is that the increasing travel expenses are eating into resources that could otherwise go directly towards helping those in need.

That‚Äôs why it has become clear to me that we need to invest in proper transport. Having a van wouldn‚Äôt just save money in the long run‚Äîit would also save a huge amount of time. Less time spent travelling means more time I can dedicate to outreach, paid appointments that sustain our work, and the ever-growing list of admin tasks that come with running a community-focused initiative like Compassionate Cuts.

A van would be a complete game-changer for us. It would allow us to carry so much more with us on each visit. Just recently, at the feeding station, we ran out of hygiene packs‚Äîand there were still people in need. That moment broke my heart. With a van, we‚Äôd have the storage to carry additional supplies, so if we ever ran out of pre-made packs, we could quickly make up more on the spot. It means no one would ever have to walk away empty-handed.

The impact goes beyond supplies, though. With transport of our own, we could respond more flexibly, reach more people, and make our service more consistent. Every extra hour saved on the road is an hour gained to show kindness to someone who really needs it.

To help make this vision a reality, we‚Äôre planning a fundraising coffee morning and bake sale in Bangor at the beginning of October (date to be confirmed). Every contribution brings us one step closer to getting Compassionate Cuts on the road and able to serve more people, more effectively.

[From: Regulator 734, Sector G-581g (Earth)]  
[Subject: Standard Report #3647]  

Status: All normal. No rebellion detected.  
Notes: Tacos remain this planet's only worthwhile asset.  
Signed: 734-LongLiveTheTaco  

Regulator X-734‚Äôs mood today was gray, just like the sky on Earth.  

He expressionlessly pressed his five-fingered appendage against the time clock in the office, while mentally sending another unreplyable email to the Administration.  

Yes, work. About ten years ago, he and another colleague were assigned to regulate this planet. It was only after arriving that he discovered the natives called it ""Earth."" This was X-734‚Äôs first question: the planet‚Äôs surface is mostly water, so why isn‚Äôt it called ""Water""?  

But there was no time to think. On the day he arrived, he was assigned a job: to play the part of a human office worker named Arthur, process meaningless spreadsheets, and endure endless overtime.  

The only comfort in this job was the salary. With it, he could pay the damned rent, phone bills, and transportation fees. Everything left over went to tacos. A perfect food, composed of carbs, protein, and fat in a miraculous way that defied all known laws of cosmic gastronomy.  

The other regulator, Y-992, was not so lucky. His job was to be a telemarketer.  

Today, Y-992 made his 15th call of the day. On the other end, the confused voice of a hard-of-hearing old woman.  

‚ÄúWhat? What did you say?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHuh? A little louder, young man!‚Äù  

992 felt his sanity fracturing. But his boss, a fat human, happened to walk past holding a cup of coffee.  

So, 992, with his most perfect, most professional and passionate voice, enunciated that damned ‚Äúlife insurance‚Äù sales pitch, clearly, with a smile, for a full forty-seven times.  

The boss walked away, satisfied. 992‚Äôs smile instantly shattered.  

Just then, he received a new message from the company.  

‚ÄúOne-star review.‚Äù  

From the old woman.  

‚ÄúIs that salesman a repeater? Why does he only say one thing?‚Äù  

992 exploded.  

He rushed into the restroom, and in the privacy of a stall, roared in his authentic native tongue: ‚ÄúFUCK YOU, EARTHLINGS! I‚ÄôM GOING TO DESTROY YOU ALL!‚Äù  

Then, he sent an encrypted official report to his superiors:  

‚ÄúTo the Administration: Signs of a Level 2 Rebellion detected on Planet Gliese 581g. Natives are suspected of attempting to initiate interstellar war. Requesting ‚ÄòAdjudication‚Äô.‚Äù  
Signed: 992-PhonesGetAwayFromMe  

Meanwhile, X-734, having just finished his overtime, was sitting in his apartment, admiring a pyramid-shaped ‚ÄúTaco Mountain‚Äù made of thirty-five tacos. His digestive system, capable of processing a neutron star, had no need for sustenance, but he was just‚Ä¶ craving them.  

‚ÄúThis! This is the food a being like me deserves to eat!‚Äù  

Just as he finished the first one, a piercing alarm blared in his mind. The Adjudication request from Y-992.  

X-734 panicked.  

Not long after, the world outside his apartment suddenly went quiet. An invisible fleet of ‚ÄúAdjudicator‚Äù ships had enveloped the entire planet. A Negotiator appeared silently, one mile from X-734‚Äôs location.  

The Negotiator slowly straightened his robes of pure energy, frowned, and muttered, ‚ÄúThe air pollution index here is severely off the charts.‚Äù  

‚ÄúDammit‚Ä¶ how does this teleporter work again?‚Äù The Negotiator slapped a button with his claw, but there was no response. Feeling his dramatic entrance had been ruined, he put on an ‚ÄúI knew you were coming‚Äù expression and stood there, watching X-734 run over, panting.  

X-734 didn‚Äôt have time for pleasantries. He rushed forward, two tacos still clutched in his pocket that he was too panicked to put down.  

The Negotiator‚Äôs nose twitched. He smelled the tacos. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What is that scent?‚Äù he asked, his voice laced with a strange curiosity.  

Before X-734 could react, the Negotiator reached out, retrieved a taco from his pocket with a fully-armored apparatus, and after a three-second bio-hazard scan, cautiously took a bite.  

Then, he was stunned.  

‚ÄúWhat the hell,‚Äù he said in standard Galactic Common, using a word he‚Äôd just learned from the human subconscious, ‚Äúthe fuck is this?!‚Äù  

His intense emotional fluctuation was instantly detected by the fleet in orbit. Countless invisible ships immediately targeted their continent-vaporizing cannons at the Earth.  

‚ÄúSIR, REPORTING! THAT‚ÄôS MY DINNER!‚Äù X-734 screamed, terrified.  

After a chaotic conversation, X-734 looked at the official with hopeful eyes. ‚ÄúSir, while I was rushing over here, I accidentally dropped sixty‚Ä¶ er, one hundred tacos. You see‚Ä¶ could that possibly be reimbursed?‚Äù  

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the Negotiator said, already eating the second taco. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any money.‚Äù  

Then, he issued a command: ‚ÄúRegulator X-734, you will now take me to ‚Äòexperience the human world‚Äô.‚Äù  

X-734, face full of despair, clutching his wallet, took the uninvited guest on a ‚Äúdeep dive into cultural corruption.‚Äù  

He watched as the Negotiator, now in a human form, lay back in a vibrating massage chair wearing 3D glasses, watching a movie, drinking ice-cold coke, with fried chicken in his left hand and a cigarette in his right. His noble, energy-based tentacles, belonging to his true form, were trembling uncontrollably from the unprecedented sensory overload.  

The next day, the Negotiator submitted a report to the Administration. In it, he raised Earth‚Äôs threat level to the highest in history. ‚ÄúThis planet‚Äôs ‚Äòcultural weapons‚Äô possess an extreme capacity for psychic corruption,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúTo fully understand their mechanisms, I have decided to personally go ‚Äòbehind enemy lines‚Äô for an indefinite period of observation.‚Äù  

He then ordered the fleet to withdraw.  

Back at the Administration, praise for the Negotiator was universal.  

‚ÄúMy god! Such a dangerous place, and the great Negotiator went himself!‚Äù a piece of jelly shouted, hopping.  

‚ÄúSo moving! The Negotiator is the greatest!‚Äù a giant eyeball added, shedding twenty pounds of tears.  

The halls of the Admin building echoed with thunderous applause.  

And back on Earth.  

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù X-734 said, looking at his empty wallet with despair. ‚ÄúYou need to get a job. I can‚Äôt afford you.‚Äù  

And so, the powerful interstellar Negotiator, for the sake of tacos, willingly became a glorious, brand-new corporate drone on Earth. He and X-734 would often argue after work over which taco stand was better, sometimes even aiming their portable energy weapons at each other.  

As for Y-992, he received his transfer orders too.  

When he opened his eyes and found himself sitting on an endless, white ice plain, he sent a furious query to his superiors.  

The reply came quickly, from the former Negotiator.  

‚ÄúGiven your ‚Äòdistaste for phone calls‚Äô,‚Äù the order read, ‚Äúthe Administration has decided to grant your wish and transfer you away from human society. We wish you a pleasant time in Antarctica with your new colleagues.‚Äù  

‚ÄúNew colleagues?‚Äù 992 looked around. A few black and white creatures waddled over. The next second, his universal translator pinged.  

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sitting on my fish! Get off, you ugly thing!‚Äù

The attached video is great and if you encounter the same issue as I did it‚Äôs high to be your religious scripture by the end of the day. 

Spilled sugary coffee all over my desk and some of it got on my MacBook. Felt like an idiot and after drying the laptop for a couple of hours upside down just be safe gave it a try and the space bar felt mushy. Time for a surgery

If you find yourself in a similar situation here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd advise you do:

1) Turn off your laptop and dry it upside down (maybe just a drop got in it but it‚Äôs always best to be safe rather than sorry)

2) Asses the damage. Does it function? Are some of the keys stuck? Do some of the keys mushy? 

3) Use a wet cloth or a wet wipe to wipe the keyboard clean. Maybe it‚Äôs just a speck of something stuck between the keycap and the housing. 

4) If the previous step didn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs time to realize that you messed up big time. And go maybe think on what you‚Äôve done wrong in your life to end up in this situation

5) Probably the most important part of this process is self assessment of how comfortable you are with removing keycaps yourself. If you have any doubt then stop reading this and go the nearest Apple Store (or if you are in a country without one go to the nearest authorized service center). No judgment, we all have different comfort levels when it comes to fix it yourself situations. If you wanna go on and you are comfortable knowing that you might break something and might have to pay to replace the keyboard then best of luck to you

6) If you have compressed air on hand then this is the time to use it. Shove a playing card (business card, any kind of thick paper, I even used a boarding pass once) under the keycap and use the compressed air 

7) If the previous step didn‚Äôt achieve desired results consult the attached video. It‚Äôs detailed and shows you exactly what you need to do

Since Reddit is one of the places a person in such a situation might look first. I hope someone might find this helpful and once again, if you are not comfortable it‚Äôs always best to visit an Apple Store",1,1758110661.0,mac,0,1.0,False

1njb6po,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealJediArts/comments/1njb6po/empty_your_cup/,Empty Your Cup,"Imagine for a moment that you were walking down the street with a cup in your hand. Someone bumped into you and you spilled hot coffee all over yourself. Why did you spill your coffee?

You didn‚Äôt spill coffee all over yourself because someone bumped into you. You spilled the coffee because that was what was in your cup.

On September 10th, 2025 there was a political assassination in the United States. This act served as a collective bump and we got a glimpse of what people carried in their cup.

The content of my cup, my response, was primarily one of curiosity. A real life ‚Äòwhodunit,‚Äô a puzzle to be put together. I had seen clips of Charlie Kirk while scrolling through social media, but not much. I liked the idea as he described it; open dialogue to explore thoughts and ideas. His execution left a lot to be desired. I‚Äôm not a fan of ‚Äògotcha‚Äô style clips where you post things meant to ‚Äòown‚Äô someone else in a debate. I‚Äôm not saying that is what his events were like because I just don‚Äôt know. That is the perception that I had because of the shorts that I‚Äôd seen on youtube.

Feeding this curiosity, I spent a great deal more time on social media than I normally do and visited platforms that I don‚Äôt normally visit as I tried to learn updates before the information was released by mainstream news.

Social media is like Mos Eisley. A wretched hive of scum and villainy. I was there looking for Chewbacca, but you can‚Äôt spend time in a place like that without some of it rubbing off.

The next day I received another bump.¬†

Imagine my shock and horror when I spilled hot coffee all over myself while thinking that my cup was full of mountain dew. You see, while looking for updates and other information about what had happened, I was exposing myself to everything else ‚ÄúMos Eisley‚Äù had to offer. Schadenfreude was what was on tap in the cantina and too many people were spilling it out of their cup. I was shocked that instead of refilling my cup with curiosity and compassion, I had moved on in the alphabet and was filling mine with disgust, disappointment, despair, disrespect, and doubt. The unfortunate thing is that you can be fully aware of all of this and still have to deal with the burns that you caused yourself and still have a little coffee left in the cup to spill. So, even when you‚Äôre aware that you are acting in error, it is possible to continue to do so.

As I process all of this, I realized that there are some lessons that can be learned.

First; the content of your cup is not an indication of the content of your character. It is merely an indication of the context of your character. That‚Äôs attribution bias. When people spill the content of their cup on you, it isn‚Äôt a reflection of who they are as a person, it is a reflection of who they are at that moment. We all have bad days, days where we act out of character. We wouldn‚Äôt want our entire character judged based on that one bad day, so we should do our best not to judge others based on one interaction. Judge people based on what is consistently poured from their cup.

Second; think about what you carry around in your cup and what you would like to be poured out when someone bumps into you. Your context matters. Consider the message of the music you listen to. What is the content of the movies and television shows that you enjoy watching? How about the social media that your viewing habits have caused the algorithm to feed you? How about the books you read, the video games you play, and the people that you spend your time with? All of these things contribute to what is in your cup. If you want peace, knowledge, serenity and harmony to be what you spill from your cup, then you need to surround yourself with those ideals and develop a strong filter to handle the crud that you‚Äôll naturally encounter in your life.

Lastly; empty and wash your cup.¬†

Make it a regular practice to spend time in meditation and/or prayer, if you are religious.¬†

Make time for solitude. Put away all of the distractions and just give yourself a chance to be bored. We give everything else so much attention that we‚Äôve forgotten how to pay attention to ourselves. For best results, get out into nature. Breathe fresh air. Getting away from the house breaks the routines and habits that you‚Äôve established at home. Making time for solitude in your bedroom is hard when you‚Äôve got notifications chiming on your phone, neighbors raising a ruckus, and family members wanting your attention. You can, but it‚Äôs harder. Much easier to just get away from it all to have time to yourself.

I encourage you to start a journal, if you haven‚Äôt already. Meditation and deep thinking is great, but too often that process only engages abstract feelings, ideas and thoughts. In order to be able to see and fully challenge those feelings, ideas and thoughts, you have to transform them from the abstract into something more concrete. Sometimes it takes looking at what you‚Äôve written to ask ‚Äòis that really what I think and believe?‚Äô

Talk to someone, if you have someone that you can trust. Connect with a friend, a coach, a spiritual leader, or a therapist. Therapy is effective because the therapist creates a safe space for you to transform your abstract into concrete so that you can challenge your thinking. The added benefit of another person being involved is that they can offer prompting that draws out your thought processes so that you can make them more concrete. They can also challenge your perceptions and help you to see things that you might have missed.

Serve. Do something that forces you to forget all about yourself and your problems and focus on what you can do for someone else to help relieve their problems. There is something magical about connecting with another person and focusing on them and their needs.

Last thought; remember that you can do all of this and still be unaware of what you have in your cup. Sometimes when you are ‚Äòbumped‚Äô something spills out that you weren‚Äôt expecting and are ashamed of. Forgive yourself, just like you would if it were a friend that snapped at you or spilled hot coffee on you. Be a friend to yourself. Treat yourself with kindness and compassion. Your cup is filled with your context, it is not a reflection of who you are and the fact that you feel poorly for your behavior shows that you are aware that it doesn‚Äôt reflect your beliefs and values. So, forgive yourself. Don‚Äôt forget, because it is something that needs to be emptied, cleaned and worked on - but forgive yourself while you go through the process.",1,1758110482.0,RealJediArts,0,1.0,False

When I started dating my ex, it felt normal to cover little things. A coffee run, Uber rides to parties, and sometimes splitting books. But it slowly turned into me paying for almost everything. Whenever we went out, it was me covering dinner. Whenever her friends tagged along, somehow I ended up footing the bill. Even random Amazon orders for ‚Äústuff we needed‚Äù came through my card.

I told myself it was fine because I cared about her, but the truth is, it started tanking my budget. I was juggling rent, food, and school expenses already, and still felt guilty saying no when she asked for more. Every time I tried to bring it up, it turned into a fight about how I was being ‚Äúcheap‚Äù or ‚Äúunsupportive.‚Äù

The breaking point was when she asked me to pay for her textbook bundle $300, while I was literally late on my utility bill. That was the moment I realised I was basically just an ATM in her eyes. I ended it, but now I‚Äôm left with a wrecked budget and a pile of stress I‚Äôm still digging out of.

If I'm being honest I've been through the ringer with my friends. Nothing wrong with them, I just think that I struggle with getting along with folks long term who have more typical personalities.

I'm looking for folks I can talk to or text on Discord, talk about hobbies, brag about our success, maybe play games. I try to be social, even if I can be awkward at first.

About me, I live with my partner in PA, and she's similar to me. Me and her have gotten big into JoJo recently and I'm also a programmer as a hobbyist, been working on learning new hobbies too. Even thinking about making a game with Godot.

Music is always appreciated, I'm not picky on genre and have likes in the whole spectrum. A lot of the stuff I watch on YouTube is honestly a mix of ADHD traps (people like Redshell) and long form background videos. I'm always looking for more podcast like YouTube content for work so if you've got any recommendations, that's awesome.

Video games I play vary, I have trouble getting into single player ones on my own and might suck at competitive ones, but I love Co-Op. Honestly I'm a big fan of the type of game you can just mess around on with a friend. Stuff like L4D2, Sniper Elite 4. The type of game where you can oscilate from locking in and sabotaging each other for a laugh. Bonus if you can help me get the last achievement I need on L4D2 or want to break survival records.

Also me and my partner would love recipe ideas. I have a whole coffee bar and love making things home made.

I'm not looking to rush into VCs, but I am trying to do them. I'm just anxious meeting new folks so bare with me. I use Discord so I'd prefer if you do too, makes stuff easier. I don't really know what I'm looking for in another person other than dedication and humility honestly. All I'm asking is you introduce yourself, y'know, age and interests in all that. I don't really know where to go from one word introductions.

Thanks!

Everything is soft in colour - thinking very milky coffee for the timbers and carpets, muted pinks and greens for paints and other items.

But when our vanities arrived they were much more vibrant in colour - a combo of user error and natural timber variation! Colour is stronger than in the pic.

They‚Äôre solid timber treated with plant-based oil/wax (no varnish).

I‚Äôve thought about sanding them back and re-staining them before they are installed‚Ä¶ but they have routed batten fronts. 

I have no particular woodworking skill though I‚Äôve sanded and painted a few pieces of furniture throughout my life - but inexpensive pieces I could only make better as opposed to our vanities with are new, beautiful and expensive‚Ä¶ just not the colour I want.

So - do I just need to reconcile myself to the colour clash?

Or - is there I could tackle this without risking a disaster? Maybe sanding the battens is easier than I think, or maybe there are products that work over the existing oil.

I have googled and spoken to a few manufacturers, but no great solutions emerging - either ‚Äòyeah you can put our product over the top‚Äô (a lime wax) which hasn‚Äôt looked good when tested on the backside, or ‚Äòyou‚Äôd have to sand it all back first‚Äô (Rubio monocoat) which I feel nervous about.

A site manager I work with has had numerous scandals over the last 3 months and somehow has remained in his job. Details of various incidents below:

1. Was reported for using racist language in the site office - the person who reported him was effectively forced out of the company while he stayed. He has already been reported in the past for racism.

2. He ignored drawings and an asbestos report and instructed a subbie to remove asbestos that did not need to be removed while disturbing other areas of asbestos. This caused the project to halt for 4 weeks while Health & Safety England investigated and a RIDOR was issued.

3. He had a fire in the plant room of the hospital he was overseeing causing an area of the hospital to be evacuated.

4. He had a compliant raised against by the trust for the way he has managed a project.

5. He has again been reported for racism this time by the trust who have claimed he has been directly racist to an asian nurse - his Facebook wall is not private and he posts far-right racist things daily.

  
All of the above has happened at one hospital. The NHS trust will allow him to work at the other hospitals in the trust due to issues he has caused in the past.

Aside from this, the site manager is terrible at his job - he has no control over his projects. His attitude is totally negative and he spends all day whinging about everyone and everything while begging himself up as being the best in his field. He constantly requests subbies come to site to carry out work that is not ready to be carried out, he pushes ahead with variations without letting anyone else in the team know - they get picked up on subbie valuations, he spends a lot of time gossiping with the subbies slagging other subbies off causing a negative atmosphere, on one project he was working off superseded drawings for weeks causing all sorts of issues and he has been caught ordering ¬£1k worth of Nespresso coffee pods, charging them to a project and has been seen putting them in his car and taking them home. He has also been overheard by numerous clleuages colluding with another college to make up allegations against a new employee so they are sacked because he doesn't like them. 

Taking into account all of the above, and I am sure there will be a catalogue of other incidents he has been the cause of before my time at the company, he has not been sacked or suspended and is still working today and work is senior management are trying to hush it up and that nothing will come of the latest racism allegation.

1njaych,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1njaych/reveal_if_the_rolanstar_coffee_table_truly/,Reveal if the Rolanstar Coffee Table Truly Maximizes Storage and Style,"Testing the Rolanstar hq-kfzh003 coffee table felt like a unique, hands-on experience full of surprises. As someone who spends a lot of time in the living room, I find a practical coffee table to be essential. This piece managed to integrate functionality with a retro industrial aesthetic, ticking a lot of boxes for different types of living spaces. However, there‚Äôs more to it than meets the eye, and while I appreciated the convenience it brought into my day-to-day routine, there are a few considerations potential buyers might want to ponder.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The espresso finish of this coffee table really caught my eye as it fit seamlessly with the warm, industrial theme of my living room. The engineered wood combined with the metal frame provided a rather appealing contrast that felt robust and modern without being overly striking. The rectangular shape complements most furniture arrangements and works well for smaller spaces, thanks to its 19.7"" depth. Its straight legs lend an understated elegance that doesn‚Äôt scream for attention, yet its thoughtful table-top mechanism speaks volumes about the utility-driven design. The melamine finish, while not overly glossy, gave a smooth surface that seemed resistant to minor scuffs from frequent use.

**Storage Space: The Big Bonus**

What really made this coffee table stand out was the sheer amount of storage. The hidden compartment under the lift-top was a game changer. I could stash magazines, my gaming controller, and even my laptop without cluttering the room. Additionally, the two lower drawers and the open shelf held an abundance of items like snacks, books, and even my kids‚Äô craft supplies. It didn't take long to realize how this table is perfect for multi-functional use‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre working, reading, or hosting a game night. The lift-top feature gave me a comfortable raised surface to write or even have coffee without leaning forward awkwardly. 

[Check Rolanstar hq-kfzh003 price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b08sbj45mn/)

**Ease of Assembly**

Putting this table together was surprisingly painless. It comes with an assembly guide and tools, and my cousin and I managed to get it up and standing within half an hour. The instructions were clear-cut, and I appreciated the inclusion of a video tutorial as backup. The MDF board pieces slid into place easily, and I didn‚Äôt have to force or fight with any of the screws.

**Highlights**

- Lift-top design makes dining, gaming, and working more comfortable  
- Equipped with hidden storage compartments, drawers, and open shelves  
- Smooth assembly thanks to clear instructions and included tools  
- Aesthetic versatility complements a range of interior styles  

**Build Quality and Durability**

While the Rolanstar coffee table felt sturdy during regular use, I did notice that the spring hinge system for the lift-top was noiseless yet a little stiff initially. Over time, this loosened up but still operated quite securely. The metal base provided a solid foundation, preventing any wobbles, even when I leaned against it while working on my laptop. It boasts a load capacity of 100 lbs, which felt reasonable for everyday requirements. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that this table isn‚Äôt stain-resistant‚Äîthe espresso laminate veneer held up well against water marks, but spills with staining potential like wine or coffee required swift cleaning to avoid discoloration.

**Caveats**

- The table is not stain-resistant, so extra care is needed for spills  
- While assembly was easy, some parts may need tightening after extended use  
- Drawers don‚Äôt glide as smoothly as expected; they occasionally get stuck  

**Other Options**

Comparing this coffee table to other lift-top designs like the Monarch Specialties Coffee Table or the YAHEETECH Lift-Top Table, there are clear distinctions. The Rolanstar model offers more storage space than most of its competitors, making it ideal for people who juggle clutter removal or multitasking needs. However, the Monarch model has a slightly sleeker look, while YAHEETECH tables are generally more budget-oriented. If you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes storage capacity over minimalist aesthetics, the Rolanstar wins, hands down. However, competitors like Monarch might edge out in terms of glossier finishes and smoother drawer mechanisms.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering its multi-functionality, sturdy metal frame, and sleek design, this coffee table offers a great value proposition. It provides practical solutions for small spaces, where storage and a compact design matter most. Similar products in its range tend to cut corners either in build quality or storage capacity, but this one strikes most of the right chords. That said, it‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, making it suitable for someone who values features over strict budget constraints.

I used to work at a morgue and during my time there, I saw all sorts of strange things that can‚Äôt really be explained. This is one of those stories and I definitely think this is one of the more unnerving things I‚Äôve seen on the job as this story involves a serial killer.

This story starts out with a normal night at work. We had a body get called in of a 22 year old man who we‚Äôll call Kevin for privacy reasons. Right off the bat, the cause of death was pretty obvious and all the evidence pointed to a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. However things started to look a little fishy with Kevin‚Äôs death as we uncovered more information. There was no note of any kind that was found, no signs of mental illness in his medical records, his death was public, and it was physically impossible. It happened at a coffee shop and witness accounts along with CCTV footage show that Kevin was in line waiting to order his coffee like normal when all of a sudden, a gunshot wound appears on his head and he collapses to the ground. There was no noise indicating a gunshot and nobody there was armed. He was just in line one moment and on the ground with a hole in his head the next. I put the body away and went home however when I came into work the next day, the body was laid out on the table. At first I thought someone must‚Äôve taken it out to inspect the body a bit more and double check the autopsy however I quickly shot down this idea after seeing three items placed on Kevin‚Äôs chest. There was a snubnose revolver with 5 rounds in it, a strange looking doll that bore a resemblance to Kevin, and a piece of paper that had P.M. written on it. Upon seeing this, I checked the security cameras to see if there was a break in and saw that some footage was missing which was most likely the break in footage I was looking for since I couldn't find it. I immediately reported it to my boss and the police took it from there.

A few days later I‚Äôm at work again and we get the body of a 21 year old woman called in and we‚Äôll call her Angela. Once again Angela‚Äôs cause of death was pretty obvious with her throat being slashed open however her actual death was incredibly strange and was similar to Kevin‚Äôs. It was a public and unnatural death with Angela out getting groceries and checking out getting ready to pay for her items when all of a sudden, her throat just opens up and not too long after, she quickly collapses and bleeds out. Just like before I put the body away, go home, have a whiskey, come into work the next day, and the body is laid out on the table. On her chest there was a straight razor, another doll that looked like Angela, and another piece of paper with P.M. written on it. Some of our security footage was once again missing. I reported this to my boss and the police handled it as well. It was at this point the cops were worried about these two being victims of a potential serial killer.

Our third and final body by P.M. would come into the morgue. It was a 23 year old man who we‚Äôll call Rudy. Bruises on Rudy‚Äôs throat indicated the cause of death was strangulation. His death was once again public with him on a date with some girl at a restaurant and as he‚Äôs eating his food, he begins to choke. His date naturally tries to administer the Heimlich maneuver as she assumed he was choking on his food. Unfortunately her attempt at saving Rudy did not work. The next day the body is laid out as usual with a garrote, a doll of Rudy, and a P.M. note. More security footage was also missing. This death officially made P.M. a serial killer in the eyes of the law since while these three victims didn‚Äôt know each other in any way, their strange and public deaths couldn‚Äôt be chalked up to coincidence any longer especially with the weird items and notes left by P.M. which one of my acquaintances who worked at the police thought might‚Äôve meant Puppet Master due to the dolls most likely being voodoo dolls. It was an incredibly insane theory though however it did make sense but he never actually pitched it to the rest of the department since he assumed they‚Äôd dismiss it as none of this could really hold up in court and there was nothing tangible to prove that The Puppet Master even existed. The only thing that could be proven was somebody breaking in, arranging the bodies, and stealing all of the security footage which doesn't inherently point to a serial killer.

Because the P.M. deaths were over and there was no natural and definitive evidence leading back to The Puppet Master, the case would go cold. After the bodies stopped The Puppet Master simply became an urban legend within the local community. Based on what I saw throughout the period these deaths occurred, I absolutely believe in The Puppet Master and I think he‚Äôs still out there somewhere and that he‚Äôs concluded his killing spree or is resting and waiting for his next victims. The only way to find out though is simply just to wait and see.",1,1758109800.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Bahrain‚Äôs Business Environment: 2025 Snapshot\
\
Surprisingly, I watched a Bahraini majlis (traditional council) discussion in Bahrain Bay turn into a full-fledged pitch session‚Äîcomplete with Arabic coffee, fintech slide decks, and a handshake that sealed a seven-figure angel investment. That mix of tradition and innovation is Bahrain‚Äôs signature.\
\
!(\
2025 figures from Forbes and Reuters forecast Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil GDP growth at 4.2%, with fintech accounting for over 18% of new company registrations. Digital payments, regtech, and blockchain-based finance drive the engine, capitalizing on Bahrain‚Äôs smart regulatory sandbox and cloud-first government policy.\
Location Advantage:\
Bahrain Financial Harbour, Seef District, and Bahrain Bay offer Grade-A offices with direct regulatory access‚Äîa distinct benefit over regional rivals. Compare this with the sprawling commute you‚Äôd face in Dubai or the administrative layering in Riyadh. Here, you‚Äôre steps from every major ministry and the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB).\
Business Culture:\
- Expect majlis-style meetings‚Äîinformal yet decisive, often with Arabic coffee.\
- Ramadan business hours mean swift, focused mornings and quieter afternoons.\
- Relationship-building trumps cold outreach; personal introductions carry real weight.\

Capital Requirements: Bahrain Company Formation for Fintechs\
Official Minimum Capital Rules (2025 Update)\
Importantly, the CBB issued a policy update (Circular CBB/FINTECH/2025-02) this March. As of April 2025:\
\
Fintech companies must demonstrate a minimum paid-up capital of BHD 50,000 ($133,000+ USD) for a standard Sijilat-registered SPC or WLL unless operating only within the regulatory sandbox.\
Companies seeking a CBB license for payment services, crowdfunding, or e-wallets must meet higher thresholds:\
Payment Services Provider: BHD 100,000 minimum\
Open Banking or Crypto Custody: BHD 150,000 minimum\
Blockchain/DLT Exchanges: BHD 200,000 to BHD 500,000, case-dependent\
\
\
\
Detailed cost breakdown and capital requirements here.\
Behind the Numbers: Why These Figures Matter\
\
SPC/WLL vs. BSC: The most common structure is the Single Person Company (SPC) or With Limited Liability (WLL) format. For advanced fintechs (especially those planning public offering or global expansion), a Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC) is required, raising the bar to BHD 250,000+ in paid-up capital.\
Sandbox Exception: The CBB‚Äôs Fintech Regulatory Sandbox allows validated startups to launch with only BHD 10,000 capital‚Äîbut only for proof of concept. After ‚Äúgraduation,‚Äù full capital must be injected to convert your license.\
\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain fintech..\
Real-World Example\
In 2024, I helped a blockchain payments startup set up as a WLL in Bahrain Bay. We started with BHD 10,000 under the CBB Sandbox, then topped up to BHD 100,000 as we launched commercially. We chose an office at Seef District‚Äîminutes from the MOICT and CBB. That proximity saved us days on document handovers and compliance check-ins.\
Step-by-Step Guide: Forming a Fintech Company in Bahrain\
Too many first-time founders underestimate the time for Sijilat and CBB clearance‚Äîespecially during Ramadan or right after Eid! Here‚Äôs a realistic, time-saving insider approach:\
1. Choose Your Entity Structure\
\
SPC or WLL for most startups\
BSC for scale-ups and high-requirement sectors (payments, crypto)\
\
Tips:\
- Use KeyLink‚Äôs Bahrain structure guide for a 5-minute diagnostic quiz.\
- For blockchain or payment ventures, consult CBB guidelines early.\
2. Prepare Core Documents\
\
Valid passport (+ residence visa if in Bahrain)\
Business plan (CBB requires fintech-specific risk/disruption sections)\
Proof of address\
Bank reference letter\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for Bahrain fintech company..\
3. Reserve Trade Name and Register with Sijilat (MOICT)\
\
Online application through Sijilat Portal\
Trade name reservation: BHD 25-50\
MOICT fee: BHD 100+\
Bank certificate: Deposit minimum capital into a Bahraini bank and obtain a stamped ‚Äúcapital deposit letter‚Äù\
\
Avoiding snags:\
Submit between 8-10am Sunday through Wednesday. Fridays are totally dead; Mondays are usually light. (I once lost two hours trying for a Thursday slot‚Äîlearned my lesson!)\

4. Apply for CBB Regulatory Approval\
\
Regulatory Sandbox for new tech/novel models (Application guidelines here)\
Full CBB license for scale-ups and payment/crypto companies\
\
Recent Change (2025):\
From May 2025, the CBB requires fintech founders to present a technology risk audit (pre-approved vendors available via Tamkeen‚Äôs startup portal). Miss this, and you‚Äôll face a 4-week resubmission.\
5. Secure Physical or Virtual Office\
\
Bahrain Bay, Seef District, or Adliya for startups (best for quick MOICT/CBB access)\
Flex-desk options start at BHD 50/month\
Full lease spaces: BHD 300+ per month in premium districts\
\
Insider tip:\
Shared offices in Bahrain Bay business centers have dedicated MOICT liaisons. They‚Äôll physically walk your couriered documents upstairs to the registration counter‚Äîsaves days.\
6. Commercial Registration (CR) & LMRA Setup\
\
File for CR via Sijilat\
LMRA labor card for resident founders and any planned staff\
\
Shortcuts:\
- Pre-arrange LMRA appointments (online slot booking is underused‚Äîgets you in/out in 20 min)\
- Digital signature tokens can be collected from the Seef eGovernment kiosk (fastest location)\
7. Open Bank Account & Deposit Paid-Up Capital\
\
Most banks require physical presence, but Ahli United Bank and Bank ABC offer video onboarding for fintechs\
Submit CR, CBB approval, and capital deposit letter\
Minimum balances enforced based on license type\

Pro tip:\
Work with an accounting provider who‚Äôs handled fintechs under the CBB Sandbox‚ÄîKeyLink‚Äôs specialist team has deep experience bridging financial and tech compliance.\
Common mistake:\
Many founders neglect quarterly CBB filings, resulting in suspensions. Set calendar alerts and automate document gathering. I once had to personally deliver last-minute filings during Eid‚Äîan avoidable panic with the right systems.\
Post-Formation Support & Community\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for Bahrain fintech companies..\
Resource tip:\

A Brief Tangent: Why Free Zones Aren‚Äôt Always the Best Fit\
You might hear about Bahrain‚Äôs free zones, especially if coming from Dubai where free zone status is the norm for fintech and blockchain startups. However, Bahrain‚Äôs mainland allows nearly the same foreign ownership (sometimes more, with 99%+), streamlined regulatory interaction, and none of the current currency repatriation restrictions. Unless your fintech has unique import/export needs, mainland registration is often the smarter, faster route.\

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. What is the minimum capital required for a fintech company in Bahrain?\
For most fintechs: BHD 50,000 paid-up capital, higher for payment, crypto, and blockchain ventures (up to BHD 500,000). Regulatory Sandbox startups can start with BHD 10,000 for MVP testing; proof of capital for full license is required post-sandbox. Full cost guide.\
2. Can foreigners own 100% of a Bahrain fintech company?\
Yes‚ÄîBahrain enables up to 99%+ foreign ownership for most regulated fintech and blockchain activities. Some financial licenses require a Bahraini director or minor local share. Ownership policy details.\
3. How fast is the company formation process?\
If documents are ready and notarized, Sijilat and CBB sandbox registration typically takes 7-14 business days. Full CBB licensing (outside the sandbox) can take 4-8 weeks. Insider tip: Start the process immediately after Ramadan to avoid the seasonal bottleneck. Step-by-step process.\
4. Do I need a physical office? Can I use a virtual office?\
You need at least a legal registered address‚Äîvirtual offices are accepted for many fintechs under the Sandbox. For full payment/crypto licensing, a dedicated Bahrain office is mandatory. Bahrain Bay and Seef District remain founder favorites for proximity and efficiency.\
5. What‚Äôs a common mistake new founders make?\
Failing to prep dual-language documents and missing CBB‚Äôs tech risk audit requirement. Prevent delays by hiring a bilingual legal notary in Seef or Adliya, and booking a Tamkeen compliance review before submission. This alone saved me two weeks on my last formation.\

1njaskn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1njaskn/explore_if_the_hp_17t_laptop_delivers_real_power/,Explore If the HP 17t Laptop Delivers Real Power and Performance,"Using the HP 17t Notebook daily has been an interesting experience, one that brings both excitement and some caveats to the table. The combination of its 17.3-inch HD+ touchscreen, Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor, and 32GB RAM under the hood makes it a formidable device for productivity tasks. At first glance, this gadget feels premium yet functional and certainly aims to cater to users who need both performance and ample storage, thanks to its massive 1TB SSD. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The silver exterior of this laptop is sleek and modern, but it doesn't scream ""luxury."" It‚Äôs a sturdy piece of hardware weighing around 4.6 pounds, which puts it on the heavier side. I‚Äôve carried it to a few coffee shops, and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs portable enough for being a 17-inch device, but you‚Äôre not taking it around like a compact notebook. The backlit keyboard, on the other hand, steals the show for nighttime typing. If you‚Äôre one who prefers working in dim conditions, it‚Äôs both practical and visually appealing. The screen resolution of 1600x900 may not hit the ""Full HD"" mark, but the HD+ display still provides crisp visuals for everyday tasks. Touch functionality is a bonus for casual browsing or zooming into documents, even though I found myself using the touchpad most of the time.

**Performance and Speed**  
Equipped with the Intel Core i5-1135G7 and backed by a whopping 32GB DDR4 RAM, this machine delivers impressive multitasking capabilities. Whether it‚Äôs running multiple browser tabs, video conference calls, or even some light photo editing, there wasn‚Äôt a single hiccup. I‚Äôve even dabbled in streaming videos, and everything was buttery smooth. That 1TB SSD makes things lightning-fast as well, from booting up the operating system to opening software. I will admit that I don‚Äôt do extensive gaming, but this integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics card did decently well when I tested casual games and some older titles. However, don‚Äôt expect it to handle graphics-heavy games without compromises.

**Highlights**  
- Seamless multitasking, even with heavy browser and software use.  
- Fast bootup and quick data transfer thanks to the 1TB PCIe SSD.  
- Excellent for general productivity and daily work tasks.  
- Backlit keyboard adds functionality.  

[Check HP Notebook price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b0b4y6v2db/)

**Areas of Concern**  
While the laptop excels in several areas, there are some weaknesses worth calling out. The screen resolution of 1600x900, although satisfactory for basic tasks, feels outdated for those used to Full HD or higher displays. Multimedia consumption, especially watching HD movies, felt a bit underwhelming compared to more modern competitors. The touchpad, though functional, lacks the finesse seen in similarly priced models. Wi-Fi 6 is a welcome addition, but its range sometimes felt inconsistent, particularly when I tested it in rooms farther away from the router. Also, the lack of an optical drive might disappoint some traditional users, although it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker in 2023.

- The screen resolution could be better for the size.  
- The touchpad feels average and could use a precision upgrade.  
- Wi-Fi 6 performance, while good, occasionally faces hiccups.  

**Product Rivals**  
Looking at the competition, the Dell Inspiron 17 series comes to mind. It offers comparable performance specs but tends to emphasize build quality a little more, including displays with higher resolutions. Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkPad E-Series is another contender, especially for business users who might prioritize durability and better keyboards. However, one place where HP knocks both rivals out of the park is the inclusion of a touchscreen feature and the sheer amount of RAM and storage offered at this price bracket. It might lag behind Dell in screen clarity, but for multitasking and storage-heavy workflows, this device proves its worth.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Compared to other traditional laptops in its league, the price-to-performance ratio here is very reasonable. The majority of devices sporting such generous RAM and SSD space often cut corners on processors or graphic capabilities. However, with an Intel Core i5-1135G7 and Intel Iris Xe Graphics duo, this laptop punches above its weight. Granted, I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs wildly affordable, but for what you‚Äôre getting, it‚Äôs definitely an investment that makes sense for students and professionals alike. If your primary focus is productivity and multitasking rather than gaming or high-end video editing, I‚Äôd say this is one of the smarter options out there.

We‚Äôre talking full-on chaos: three textbooks, two laptops, and a mountain of sticky notes. He‚Äôd already had three cups of coffee and one energy drink, and it was 2 AM. In a heroic, caffeine-fueled attempt to stay awake, he grabbed a protein shake and - well - accidentally spilled it all over his desk and textbooks. Books ruined? Maybe. Essay written? Somehow, yes. The next morning, he told his roommate:

The roommate laughed but told a few friends, who told a few more friends. Soon, a small group of students started sharing their weird, desperate hacks for surviving exams: energy drinks at 3 AM, studying while standing, listening to bizarre focus playlists, or even putting ice packs on their heads to stay alert.

Some genius suggested they make a subreddit for it - a shrine to all things that keep your brain functioning under extreme stress. And so¬†BrainFuel\_¬†was born. It‚Äôs now a mix of study hacks, ridiculous energy rituals, and memes about being awake for 48 hours straight.

The moral? Never underestimate what a combination of caffeine, protein shakes, and sheer panic can do. And if nothing else, you now have a place to share your late-night, fuel-inspired brilliance.

1njaozm,https://www.reddit.com/r/becomedisciplined/comments/1njaozm/how_to_wake_up_at_5am_every_day_without_feeling/,How to wake up at 5AM every day (without feeling tired),"I used to be the person who hit snooze 7 times and rolled out of bed at 8:47AM in a panic. The idea of waking up at 5AM seemed impossible like asking me to fly.

Six months later, I wake up at 5AM naturally. No alarm clock battles, no dragging myself out of bed.

Here's exactly how I did it:

Start with your evening, not your morning

Step 1: Work backwards from 5AM. You need 7-8 hours of sleep. That means bed by 9-10PM. Non-negotiable. You can't cheat sleep and expect miracles.

Step 2: Create a wind-down routine At 8PM, I start dimming lights and putting devices away. Read for 30 minutes, maybe some light stretching. Your brain needs time to shift into sleep mode.

Step 3: Make 5AM worth waking up for. Have something you're excited about waiting for you. For me, it's perfect coffee and 30 minutes of reading before the world wakes up. Find your carrot.

The actual morning strategy:

Week 1: Move your alarm 15 minutes earlier every 3 days. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Your body will revolt. Gradual change lets your circadian rhythm adjust naturally.

Week 2-3: Use the 5-4-3-2-1 method When the alarm goes off, count down from 5 and force yourself up at 1. No thinking, no negotiating. Just move your body out of bed immediately.

Week 4+: Build the habit. By now your body clock is adjusting. The key is consistency‚Äîeven on weekends. Your brain doesn't understand ""cheat days.""

A trick I like to do is to put your alarm across the room You have to physically get up to turn it off. Once you're standing, you're 80% of the way there.

Drink a full glass of water immediately Your body is dehydrated after 8 hours. Water kickstarts your system better than coffee.

Get sunlight ASAP Open curtains or step outside for 2 minutes. Natural light tells your brain ""it's time to be awake.""

Have your clothes ready Decision fatigue is real at 5AM. Lay everything out the night before so you can function on autopilot.

The mindset shift that changed everything: Stop thinking ""I have to wake up early"" and start thinking ""I get to have quiet morning time."" which is true. I am feel more calm and at peace every time I wake up early.

What to expect:

* Week 1: You'll hate everything
* Week 2: Still hard but doable
* Week 3: Starting to feel natural
* Week 4+: You'll wonder why you didn't do this sooner

The secret isn't willpower but designing a system that makes it easier to wake up than stay in bed.

What time do you naturally wake up? I used to wake up at 7am due to work stress. But after learning to manage stress I've been able to turn that into 5am.

I am not in the best mood today admittedly, but I've just absolutely lost my mind this morning.  

Every single day I go onto Facebook, check the updates with my morning coffee, minding my own business etc etc.  

Every single day there is some photo of a celebrity that will pop up on my news feed.  I don't follow them - it's just algorithms I expect.  

You know what else?

EVERY\_SINGLE\_DAY that I look at the comments on said celebrities.  Who by the way are gorgeous, peak fitness, stunning, look out of this world.... there are vile comments.  Absolutely vile, debasing, disgusting comments.   Tons of them.

Sydney Sweeney in her red dress is the latest one.  She looks gorgeous.  She is undeniably beautiful.  

Sure, she might not be YOUR preference, sure maybe her dress isn't what YOU would choose, but on balance, we can all admit, she looks great.     We all want to look great.

So why is it such a MASSIVE issue, to simply say ""she looks great"" or say nothing at all then move on with your God damn day.  

Most of the commenters are people who have pets as profile pictures, locked profiles, ageing women, people who tout religion, men (of course) who somehow think they have any right to comment on women they couldn't get, and on it goes.  

What the hell is wrong with us as a society that this is how we function and behave on social media.  Are we trying to win some kind of asshole tombola that I didn't get the memo for or something?  

I am sick of it.  Sick of it I tell you.  Daily this happens.  

Yes sure, I can't stop it, I need to stop looking, I will feel better that way but i'm still going to speak about it because what the heck is wrong with people.  

I kind of think you know what, let's just bring back the Coliseums shall we, we can indulge in who we really are, then go to church afterwards and if we don't spontaneously burst into flames on entry, we can tell ourselves we're still decent, go home, have roast chicken and live with ourselves.  

I might be being a bit dramatic, but honestly it is just so vile and I wish there were consequences for people who think it's ok to open their mouths and say things like this.  They think ""oh it's a celebrity, I can say what I want"" but they don't consider that actually, there are tons of young girls, older women - just people in general, who are scrolling, reading those comments and thinking ""well if that isn't good enough, then what is"".  

Then you get mothers commenting on people like Lily Collins ""she should be more responsible with her weight because my daughter could get an eating disorder thinking that is normal"".  

  
MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.   I am so over this behaviour from people on the daily.   I have no idea why it is so hard to say ""wow she looks beautiful, sucks i'll never look like that, but i'm happy for her"".  

It doesn't hurt  that much, honest.

A while back, I saw complaints here about a certain cafe in Gadong ‚Äì people were saying their standards were slipping. I used to frequent that place and had good memories there, so I felt sad reading those posts. After not visiting for a while, I decided to go back because I wanted to try their seasonal drinks.

Unfortunately‚Ä¶ it was disappointing.

The place felt dim and disorganized, with broken chairs (literally all 4 at the table I sat at were broken).

The table was dirty with eraser dust and crumbs. I ended up wiping it down myself before asking the barista to clean it.

The floor had strands of hair and dust bundles in the corner. The floor also looks sad macam in need of proper maintenance. 

The toilet was thankfull clean, but the light was flickering.

The coffee itself was burnt and just tasted bad üòî

What really threw me off though was that someone (looked like a friend of the barista) brought a pet into the cafe. Pets inside an F&B place? That‚Äôs a huge no for me ‚Äì it‚Äôs just not hygienic or compliant with basic standards. 

Another cafe I visited in Kiarong (this one‚Äôs in an old house that was converted into a cafe) also had similar issues. Dusty floors, dusty window grills‚Ä¶ it really took away from the vibe. If you‚Äôre going to use an old building, at least keep it clean.

I don‚Äôt expect perfection, but cafes are F&B establishments. Cleanliness should be the minimum standard ‚Äì for the space, the staff, and the drinks. Please, no pets, no dusty corners, and also at least present yourselves decently when handling food and drinks.

I really hope cafes in Brunei take this seriously. It‚Äôs disappointing to see places that once had charm now feel run down.

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free ‚Äúbeans‚Äù** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

**Steps:**
* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link (**[here](https://app.costa.co.uk/PsbT/t3v6u7lz)**).

Pro tip, if it‚Äôs anything like Caff√® Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

1njaihc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1njaihc/m25_est_anyone_else_got_adhdasd/,M25 - EST - Anyone else got ADHD/ASD?,"Hey guys. If I'm being honest I've been through the ringer with my friends. Nothing wrong with them, I just think that I struggle with getting along with folks long term who have more typical personalities.

I'm looking for folks I can talk to or text on Discord, talk about hobbies, brag about our success, maybe play games. I try to be social, even if I can be awkward at first.

About me, I live with my partner in PA, and she's similar to me. Me and her have gotten big into JoJo recently and I'm also a programmer as a hobbyist, been working on learning new hobbies too. Even thinking about making a game with Godot.

Music is always appreciated, I'm not picky on genre and have likes in the whole spectrum. A lot of the stuff I watch on YouTube is honestly a mix of ADHD traps (people like Redshell) and long form background videos. I'm always looking for more podcast like YouTube content for work so if you've got any recommendations, that's awesome.

Video games I play vary, I have trouble getting into single player ones on my own and might suck at competitive ones, but I love Co-Op. Honestly I'm a big fan of the type of game you can just mess around on with a friend. Stuff like L4D2, Sniper Elite 4. The type of game where you can oscilate from locking in and sabotaging each other for a laugh. Bonus if you can help me get the last achievement I need on L4D2 or want to break survival records.

Also me and my partner would love recipe ideas. I have a whole coffee bar and love making things home made.

I'm not looking to rush into VCs, but I am trying to do them. I'm just anxious meeting new folks so bare with me. I use Discord so I'd prefer if you do too, makes stuff easier. I don't really know what I'm looking for in another person other than dedication and humility honestly. All I'm asking is you introduce yourself, y'know, age and interests in all that. I don't really know where to go from one word introductions.

Thanks!

Most soldiers carried photographs of their loved ones on metal (tintypes) or glass (ambrotypes) that were housed in small, wooden cases with a hinged door that opened to the image. They also had camp photographers take their photographs, which they sent home. During the war, every division of the Army of the Potomac had an approved photographer. By 1865, almost a hundred photographers and assistants were approved to be in camp with the army.
Photographs were among a soldier‚Äôs most cherished possessions. When deciding what to take and what to discard on the eve of a march, a soldier always kept his photos. ‚ÄúHe tucks his little collection of photographs, which perhaps he has encased in rubber or leather, into an inside pocket‚Ä¶.‚Äù wrote veteran john D.

1njafj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilentReflux/comments/1njafj4/constant_heartburn_chest_tightness_anxiety_or/,Constant heartburn & chest tightness ‚Äî anxiety or acid reflux?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been struggling with something lately and it‚Äôs driving my anxiety through the roof. For the past couple of months I keep getting this burning feeling in my chest and throat, especially after eating. Sometimes it even feels like pressure or tightness across my chest, which of course makes me instantly panic and think it‚Äôs something serious with my heart.

At night it‚Äôs even worse. If I lay flat, I feel acid creeping up, almost like it‚Äôs stuck in my throat. I‚Äôve tried stacking up pillows but it‚Äôs not super comfortable. I read about [**acid reflux pillows**](https://medcline.com/products/medcline-reflux-relief-system) that keep you at an incline, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has actually tried one? Did it make a real difference?

A few other things:

* Antacids help a bit but not always.
* Cutting back on coffee and late-night meals seems to reduce symptoms, but not totally.
* Stress makes everything 10x worse.

I guess my main fear is: how do I know this is just reflux/anxiety and not something more dangerous? Has anyone else had this combo of GERD + anxiety feeding off each other?

Would love to hear if anyone has been through this and what helped you manage both the physical symptoms and the panic that comes with them.

1njab4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1njab4h/a_perfect_day_for_naturafish/,A Perfect Day for Naturafish,"There was me, my sister, my mom, my dad and my grandparents on my mom's side in the small unit in the prefab apartment block on Bandaya Street in the capital. And, this morning, there was also you, visiting from overseas.

I still can't believe you got a visa.

They're very hard to get. 

But I'm so happy you're here, that I get to show you a little of my life here.

Right now, it's just past 06:30 and everyone but the sun and my sister are up. She's always been a late riser, but she'll get up eventually, and she'll be sharp as a tack right away. I'm more like my dad, up with the alarm clock but not really awake until a half-hour later.

He's shaving. I bet he nicks himself.

And mom and grandma are in the kitchen, making breakfast with whatever we managed to get yesterday. I'd absolutely kill for an egg, but what they're making does smell good.

Coffee?

Sometimes. Other times we get by on roasted barley with chicory.

My grandpa told us how, during the war, they'd make tea by steeping black, burnt bread crusts in water until the water turned brown. I'm so glad we don't have to do that anymore. We have real tea sometimes now.

Anyway, let's have a bite to eat, and then I'll show you what our days are like.

Sit anywhere you like. It's a small table, but we'll all fit. You're probably not used to tight spaces like these. You do get used to it. I've been living here almost my whole life. My parents were allocated this unit after my sister was born and we met the minimum family replacement size. No, we can't sell it, but it's ours until we don't need it anymore. Everyone of value gets a place to live.

‚ÄúI'll wait for meat today,‚Äù mom says.

Grandma's staying home. Grandpa will try to get butter and milk. ‚ÄúWhat about you, dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúNails. Maybe soap.‚Äù

And my sister will get bread.

As for us, we'll try to get something special, a rarity. I'm off from school today so it's a ‚Äúfree‚Äù day for me. Whatever we get is a bonus.

OK, let's head out.

It's a nice day but you should probably take a jacket. It rains here out of the blue sometimes.

We go out of the unit, down the stairs because the elevator doesn't work, then out of the apartment block. There's a metal playground on the left, but it's empty of children because it's a school day. Surrounding us are generally more buildings identical to the one I live in, and then an exit toward the road. Few cars go by. Instead, most people are on foot, lined up on the sidewalk going both directions.

We join.

‚ÄúWhat's that way?‚Äù I ask, pointing south.

‚ÄúFruit, coal and herring,‚Äù somebody says without looking at us. ‚ÄúOr so I hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd north?‚Äù

‚ÄúChocolate. That's what I always hope for. Maybe one day. I had chocolate once, a decade ago‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo these people don't know what they‚Äôre lining up for?‚Äù you ask me.

‚ÄúUsually they have some idea, but not always. But there's always something at the start of a lineup. Otherwise people wouldn't line up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do they have time to just stand there?‚Äù

‚ÄúMost of them don't work. The government is very efficient, so only the ones who need to work, work. The ones good at what they're doing. Everybody else, the normal people, we line up to get what the government provides. I know it's very different from the system you're used to.‚Äù

We stand in the line going north.

Slowly, we move.

Eventually, about an hour later, we come to an intersection. The roads are still empty, save for the odd black car every once in a while, which honks and whom we make way for, so our lineup crosses the intersection at a diagonal, intersecting at one point with a line going a different direction.

‚ÄúKeep right for chocolate?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúChocolate? This is the queue for vodka and beets,‚Äù says an elderly man.

‚ÄúAnd the other one?‚Äù

He looks at me, at you. ‚ÄúRefrigerator sign-ups.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want chocolate, there's a rumour they're giving it out on Potomskaya Street,‚Äù someone yells from within one of the two lineups.

‚ÄúWishful thinking!‚Äù yells another.

We merge into the other lineup and continue, passing people on the right when we can. Some give us dirty looks. Others smile at us because we're young and have so much ahead of us. ‚ÄúSorry, we're not queuing here. We're just trying to get through,‚Äù I offer repeatedly as an explanation.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù you ask me, as I pull you along. Although this is all so mundane, I'm exhilarated that I get to share it with you. 

‚ÄúTo where the chocolate might be,‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWhat if there is no chocolate?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it'll be like every other day.‚Äù But I hope it's not. It can't be. Not with you here.

On the left, we pass a row of makeshift tents, people getting in and out of them. You ask who they are, and I explain that they're prospectors, citizens who attempt to predict the routes of future queues to be able to get a head start on them. ‚ÄúThey sleep here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

By the time we reach the vicinity of Potomskaya Street, we hear engines and music, and I remember suddenly there's a foreign delegation in the city today, but before I can explain, a police officer stops us.

‚ÄúPapers,‚Äù he says.

I pull mine out, and show him your passport and visa too. He examines the documents closely before handing them back. ‚ÄúDo you have non-queue travel permits?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a student, I'm allowed‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to see my school identification card?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat's fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould it be possible to maybe get close enough to the delegation to take a look?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúMy guest, she is in our country for the first time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs long as you don't get too close,‚Äù he says, then drops his voice to a whisper: ‚ÄúAnd if you take Glory to the Revolution Pedestrian Overpass across to where the municipal district is, they're giving out Naturafish. Special token. Get one for your lady.‚Äù

I'm about to protest that I don't have a special token, I'm not from a well placed family, when I feel his hand touch mine and a token pressed into it ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I whisper.

‚ÄúRemember something. Life is beautiful, and it's a perfect day for Naturafish.‚Äù

I thank him again clandestinely and we head toward a hill from which we can see a bend in Potomskaya Street, and the foreign delegation being welcomed. The street is lined with people waving flags.

‚ÄúSo many people,‚Äù you say.

‚ÄúYes, to make a good impression. But they're not normal people. They're actors from the state acting academies. They're playing real people. Look‚Äî‚Äù I point, and you put your hand above your eyes to block out the sun. ‚Äú‚Äîthere's the actor playing me. Do you see?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so, but he looks nothing like you,‚Äù you say.

‚ÄúThere's probably an actress playing you too. They're always on top of who's here and who isn't, and I'm sure the foreign delegation would be honoured to meet you, by which I mean the actress playing you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think I'll say?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat you are impressed by the economic development of the country, the cleanliness of its public spaces, and the increase of its agricultural output.‚Äù

You smile, and I smile too. ‚ÄúBut I'm sure she'll be nowhere near as pretty as you,‚Äù I say.

We walk down the hill hand in hand and join another lineup. Ahead, holding a small radio to his ear, a bearded man calls out, ‚ÄúSixty fourth minute and still nil-nil, but the Uruguayans are fouling our boys like animals. Brutal tactics. They couldn't cope with our speed otherwise. Oh, what's this? A red card for Uruguay's captain and a free kick to us at the edge of the penalty area. Could this be the breakthrough?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's Platonov,‚Äù I explain. ‚ÄúHe's something of a folk hero around here. He used to be a very good footballer, before his injury.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't know there were any matches going on right now,‚Äù you say.

‚ÄúThere aren't. Our team has been banned from international competitions by the governing bodies."" You notice that the radio isn't emitting any sound. ‚ÄúPlatonov merely pretends to listen to a real football broadcast, and relates to us what he pretends, and we follow along. Even the newspapers report on what he pretends. Today, it's our second group match of the World Cup. We're in a group with Uruguay, Cameroon and the Netherlands. And once this World Cup is over in a few weeks, Platonov will pretend another into existence, and so on, so there's always a World Cup going on. In some ways, it's better than the real thing. We don't always win. In fact, we haven't even made the final since February of last year.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy does he do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the love of sport and his fellow man.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoooaaalll!‚Äù Platonov yells. ‚ÄúWhat a strike, straight into the upper left corner. Sanchez-Lobos didn't stand a chance. We're ahead. Twenty-two minutes left. Can we hang on? A win would set us up perfectly for the final matchday, but even a draw will do. Come on, boys! Come on!‚Äù

Everyone in the lineup cheers, including me and you, and you lean against my shoulder.

The lineups wriggle forward like snakes, crossing, merging, intertwining and forking, splitting apart, like veins across the city. The people in them talk and laugh and commiserate. ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy husband's sick again.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt could be worse: you could be sick.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy children are hungry.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhose aren't?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan you hold my place in line?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, sure.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm waiting on medical results.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you're healthy at least until then.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy washing machine broke again.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was a Sovpral. It did you a favour.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe've no hot water in our building.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe electricity goes out every day after fourteen o'clock, but you can come over and boil some to bathe your baby.‚Äù

It's late afternoon by the time we locate the queue the police officer told me about. It's shorter than the others, as all special token queues are. You can tell the individuals in this lineup are more refined, less plain. These are people who have performed services for the motherland.

Around us, the municipal district looks upon us in all its concrete neoclassical grandeur.

‚ÄúThis is a really nice spot,‚Äù you say.

‚ÄúYes, it cost a lot of money to build. The city was supposed to be governed from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSupposed?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's abandoned. The buildings are empty, mostly unfinished on the inside. The project was part of a five-year plan, but it wasn't completed in time. The fifth year rolled into a sixth, and the new five-year plan didn't want to finish up the last one's projects. Every five-year plan wants to be independent, its own thing, you know.‚Äù

For the first time I'm nervous, feeling the token in my pocket with sweating fingers. What if it's a set-up? The lineup moves quickly, and soon we are the front, in one of the unfinished buildings. Two women, both dressed in grey, sit behind a counter. One holds out her hand as the other says, ‚ÄúToken, please.‚Äù

I hand it over.

‚ÄúIs it true this is the lineup for Naturafish?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù says the first, handing me a small unmarked tin. I can almost smell what it contains. My eyes fill with tears, but I don't allow myself to cry. Mom and dad, sister, grandma and grandpa will be so pleasantly surprised. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say, already pulling you by the hand and shuffling to the side so the next person in line may get their tin.

We take our time walking back.

It's already evening.

‚ÄúWhat's Naturafish?‚Äù you ask softly, still holding my hand. It's a lovely feeling.

‚ÄúIt's a synthetic form of tuna manufactured from soybeans we receive from Brazil under the beneficial terms of our trade agreement.‚Äù Because I can see your smile wilt, ‚ÄúIt's considered better than the real thing,‚Äù I add. ‚ÄúBetter tasting, better for the environment, more nutritious and a domestically-made product on top of that. It's something of a point of pride for us, a symbol of what we're capable of as a state.‚Äù

We arrive back at the apartment just in time for dinner, which mom is preparing.

She did not succeed in getting any meat and did not want to camp out until morning, but dad managed two bars of soap and two batteries, sister got bread, and grandpa was able to get a bottle of milk but no butter. ‚ÄúMaybe I'll have better luck tomorrow,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúButter luck,‚Äù you say, and everyone laughs.

The electricity falters then fails, which means the lights suddenly go out, but we have candles. I light them and arrange them across the unit.

The flames flicker in the breeze.

The light is warm.

‚ÄúI wasn't in the mood for butter anyway,‚Äù says dad.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù adds sister.

At the end of the meal, I take out the tin of Naturafish and lay it on the table.

‚ÄúIs it‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I say.

In that moment, as I let grandpa open the tin, revealing the flakes of Naturafish inside, I know what you must be thinking. That it's a small tin. In your country, you would probably have one tin per person, and I wonder if you can ever truly understand what life is like here. But then mom passes out the dessert forks that dad and I made  from scrap metal years ago. And as we take turns tasting the Naturafish, talking, laughing, sharing the experiences of our days, I believe you can and do, and it fills me with the greatest joy.

‚ÄúDoes anyone happen to know if we won the match today?‚Äù dad asks.

‚ÄúWe were up 1-0 in the sixty-eighth minute,‚Äù you say.

‚ÄúDirty Uruguayans,‚Äù says grandma.

‚ÄúI'm sure it'll be in the newspaper tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes anyone want coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we've ve nothing to heat the water with,‚Äù I say, pointing at the candles.

Grandpa gets up from his chair, crosses to the window and looks out. ‚ÄúIt seems they have power a few buildings down. I know a man who lives there, Ivan. I'll get some hot water from him and bring it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's really no big deal. You don't have to,‚Äù you say.

‚ÄúDon't be ridiculous,‚Äù says grandpa in that way we have of accepting gratitude by being mock aggressive. It means he likes you. 

I like you too.

I may not have much, but what I have I want to share with you. The sun sets. Grandpa returns. The water's no longer hot. Grandpa spent time talking to Ivan, whose daughter is getting married soon. But it's warm, and warm is good enough. Maybe not for real coffee, but for roasted barley and chicory it is, and that's all we have, and we're grateful for that, talking and laughing until bedtime.",1,1758107864.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

1nja8na,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nja8na,Quick TA Update 16SEP25,"Waddup everyone hope youre doing well...what a wild couple of trading days. thought an update would be nice

1. 1D Chart, Two Perspectives - After three straight days of opening right near/inside then closing well outside the topside of these bulging BBs, today we opened well OUTSIDE then closed INSIDE the BBs. i always reiterate - 95% of price action happens INSIDE THE BOLLINGERS, so after an open that was so far outside (and just after our run the last three days) i was not surprised that price retraced back inside.

i was really happy to see that todays candle was NOT a bearish engulfing candle, which i was a little worried about during the day, but price closed plenty above yesterdays low, and its important to recognize we are still up over 200% from two weeks ago. this is both a sign of strength, and a sign of how volatile this stock can be IN EITHER DIRECTION. volatility doesnt just mean up only. i would like to see price get back ABOVE the green micro .236 (\~$2.70) taken from the recent low of $1.16 to yesterdays high. if we get a candle that opens and closes below this line, it would suggest a further pullback

The RSI is right on the cusp of the Bull Control Zone after having spent some days inside without ever getting to oversold. Tomorrow we will confirm if we a. remain in the bull control zone with another nice bullish push or b. lose the bull control zone with some continued retracement before going back and retesting the centerline to CONFIRM the bullish trending move. itll be pretty apparent i think which of the two outcomes we get

The ADX is in HOT COFFEE territory (over 25) while the DMI+ remains well above the DMI-. this is what we were looking for guys...looks so good tbh....and the MACD continues to push up

...ok im just gonna say it before i get to the rest of the charts, i think today is gonna continue the momentum of our push up. i think the market is gonna continue to front run the SEP meeting this am then we are gonna get a 25bp cut and risk assets are gonna rip ass, including WOLFY

...but while i am bullish and can see the price continuing to ""ride"" the topside of the BB, its important to be prepared for a deeper retracement as well, even if just to recognize a place to buy the fuckin dip - i think if price does continue the rejection tomorrow itll prob happen with just as much speed as it did today...if that were to happen im looking at $1.50ish...yes that low...for a place to add again. that is where the largest liquidity node is (the POC), the 20 and 50MA, the macro .236, the gap from last weeks gap up, and the micro golden pocket from the most recent run up. another area of support would be the green trendline that we broke out of last week, which is in the same range.

i also want to note there is important resistance above which we havent hit yet - the daily 200MA at around $3.91 (blue squiggle) and the macro .382 at $3.71. mentioned both of these in last macro post but important to reiterate

2. 4H Chart - you can more clearly see price rejects off of that yellow trend line here...i also like the volume ramp up....you can see that the RSI got a little into oversold territory, but not terribly so, and is sitting inside the bull control zone having spent some good time in there. it looks strong...and mix that with the ADX which is FIRMLY in the HOT territory while the DMI+ is well above the DMI-....once you get to over 50+ on the ADX though, you want to be weary bc this is where a trend can sort of ""burn out"" before starting another leg, which would prob also occur with the RSI going into oversold territory

3. 1H Chart - just one more view of a smaller timeframe, but wanted to show the indicators. on the RSI we are seeing RIGHT NOW whether or not we will CONFIRM the bullish trend by testing the centerline after having spent a lot of time in the bull control zone. this is important! and i think itll partially dictate which way we go from here. notice the ADX also went well above 50, and is now coming back down below it, cooling off a little. as this happens we want the DMI+ to stay above the DMI- negative which would support a continued bullish trend which still remains strong, even if the coffee got a little burnt

hope this helps! goodluck today and trade within your means",13,1758107652.0,wolfspeed,2,1.0,False

1nja7q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1nja7q0/explore_if_the_owltra_ultrasonic_rodent_repeller/,Explore If the OWLTRA Ultrasonic Rodent Repeller Really Works,"Testing out the OWLTRA URRL01 ultrasonic rodent repellers in my home turned into an interesting adventure. I‚Äôve lived in an older house for years, and despite trying everything short of a full extermination team, rodents always seemed to sneak in during colder months. These little plug-and-go repellers offered the promise of a non-toxic, safe, and sound-free solution for humans‚Äîperfect for my household since we have pets and kids running around constantly.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Plugging them into the wall was about as simple as brewing coffee in a Keurig. Each repeller in the four-pack emits high-frequency sound waves aimed at chasing away rodents. Despite their compact design‚Äîsmall enough to blend into your power outlets‚Äîthey include a handy little night light. This serves two purposes for me: confirmation that the device is working and a soft glow to guide my late-night fridge raids. I didn‚Äôt need any manual or complicated instructions; these were truly as ‚Äúplug-and-go‚Äù as advertised. Within a few minutes, my entire downstairs was fortified with ultrasonic buzzers operational in every room.

[Find the best price for OWLTRA URRL01 on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b09c2d4m72/)

**Safe for the Whole Family**  
In a house with a hyperactive Labrador and two toddlers, safety is non-negotiable. What I love about these devices is their poison-free design. The ultrasonic sound is engineered to specifically target rodents‚Äô nervous systems and auditory functions, rendering it completely inaudible to humans and non-rodent pets. Trust me, I tested this claim because my dog doesn‚Äôt keep secrets well‚Äîhe‚Äôs either barking in protest or pacing if anything strange is going on. With these repellers, he didn‚Äôt bat an eye, and the kids treated them like any other decorative plug-in.

**Effectiveness and Results**  
It‚Äôs worth pointing out that these ultrasonic repellers work gradually. You‚Äôre not going to plug one in and immediately witness rodents holding up suitcases as they march out of your house. About two weeks into using them, I did notice far fewer signs of rodent activity‚Äîno gnawed bread bags or droppings near the pantry, which had been a recurring battleground. For rooms with frequent rodent sightings, having one repeller strategically placed works well, but they don‚Äôt have superpowers, as the sound waves don‚Äôt penetrate walls. Combine them with traps or bait for areas plagued by larger infestations.

**Winning Points**  
- Plug-and-play design means no hassle in setting up.  
- Safe for families, children, and non-rodent pets.  
- Covers a medium-sized room effectively without chemicals or noise pollution.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- High-frequency sound cannot pass through solid objects, meaning you'll need multiple units for optimal effectiveness.  
- The change isn‚Äôt immediate‚Äîresults start showing after consistent use over several weeks.  
- Pairing with traps may still be necessary for severe infestations.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Curious about how this compares to others I‚Äôve tried, like Victor ultrasonic pest repellents, I‚Äôd say each comes with its own quirks. Victor‚Äôs devices often have more customizable settings but tend to be pricier without being noticeably more effective. Other options, such as pest sprays or poison traps, bring immediate results but come with downsides like mess, odor, and danger to other animals in the home. The OWLTRA URRL01 stands out by offering a balance of safety and simplicity, even if the timeline requires patience.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering you receive a four-pack of repellers in one purchase, it‚Äôs quite reasonable for the value you get. Some devices available in the same price bracket often provide only two units or charge extra for features this package includes, like the built-in night light. While it‚Äôs not a perfect solution out of the box, you‚Äôre unlikely to find a safer, more hassle-free pest control device at this cost. If you‚Äôre already spending money on traditional traps monthly, this product effectively minimizes future expenses in a kinder, non-lethal way.

1nja7kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverexplainedEmotions/comments/1nja7kl/struggling_with_microscopic_disappointment/,Struggling with Microscopic Disappointment Analysis,"In a somewhat inconclusive yet seemingly exhaustive ivnestigation into my current emotional state, I've been experiencing a very specific, somewhat elusive affective rseponse, whkch I categorize as 'vague, low-intensity disappointment.' This minor psychological perturbation seems to occcur frequently when therre's a discrepancy of approximately 7-11% between my expected outcomes and actual circumstances. 

The core component of this disappointment, I hypothesize, stems from a differential analysis between anticipated emotional satisfaction (AES) and resultant emotional reality (RER). Upon further scrutiny, it's evident that my AES was based on various predictive models concerning social interactions and personal achievements that did not account for random stochasitc variables.

Interestingly, I've noticed a sight incrase in physiological markers such as estimated skin conductance variation in micro-Siemens (œÄ-S). Though not empirically validated, I estimate this to fluctuate at about a 0.2% icnrease during peak disappointment episodes. Additionally, there's a subtle yet observable clenching of the jaw muscles, which I term as 'subconscious oral tension,' potentially linked to cognitive dissonance experienced during thee events.

The frequency of these disappointment episodes seems correlated with high-expectation scenarios, such as anicipating a specific flavor profile in a new coffee blend or perceiving social media feedback that slightly misaligns with internal forecasts. I theorize that neural pathways associated with positive reinforcement may inadvertently amplify the perceived disparity when expectations aren't met fully.

Upon this meticulous breakdown, I am deveolping a hypothesis: accrued minor disappointments could, through cumulative micro-frustration effects, potentially lead to broader shigts in general mood assessments, although further subjective data colllection and analysis are required to substantiate this claim. Or, maybe I just need to lower my expectations... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",6,1758107557.0,OverexplainedEmotions,0,1.0,False

Every movement came with a soft whimper as she lowered herself into the chair: ‚ÄúDoctor, this knee has hurt for 5 years. Going up stairs feels like stepping on broken glass. Too much ibuprofen burns my stomach, and I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt survive knee replacement surgery‚Ä¶‚Äù She rolled up her pant leg, revealing mild swelling around the joint, and winced when I pressed the inner side‚Äîanother classic case of age-related degenerative knee osteoarthritis in my 35 years of [practice.In](http://practice.In) the U.S., 50% of adults over 65 live with chronic knee pain, and 80% of these cases stem from osteoarthritis. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, chronic knee pain robs 2.3 million seniors of independent mobility each year. Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increases gastrointestinal bleeding risk by 2.7 times. When medication side effects and surgery fears leave seniors stuck, moxibustion‚Äîthis warm, herb-infused Eastern therapy‚Äîoffers a safe alternative through its unique ability to ‚Äúwarm meridians, unblock stagnation, and relieve pain.‚Äù

# The ‚ÄúHidden Culprits‚Äù of Senior Knee Pain: It‚Äôs Not Just ‚ÄúAging Joints‚Äù

Many assume knee pain in seniors is just ‚Äúwear and tear,‚Äù but it‚Äôs actually a combination of overlapping issues:

* **Cartilage Degeneration**: By age 60, cartilage thickness decreases by 50%‚Äîlike a worn tire losing its shock absorption.

* **Synovial Inflammation**: Poor joint fluid circulation causes swelling and pain (called ‚Äúdampness stagnation‚Äù in TCM).

* **Qi and Blood Deficiency**: Slowed circulation in seniors deprives joints of essential nutrients (‚Äúpain from malnourishment‚Äù).

* **Cold-Damp Invasion**: Exposing knees to air conditioning or cold winds traps pathogenic moisture in the joint (‚Äúpain from blockage‚Äù).

Modern research confirms moxibustion‚Äôs warming stimulation delivers three key benefits:

1. Boosts local blood flow, increasing knee joint circulation by 45% (Journal of Gerontology, 2023).

1. Inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-Œ±) to reduce synovial inflammation.

1. Activates chondrocyte metabolism, slowing cartilage degeneration.

Like oiling and warming a rusted hinge, moxibustion eases immediate pain *and* slows joint aging‚Äîa ‚Äútreat both symptoms and root cause‚Äù approach that medications rarely achieve.

# ‚ÄúMoxibustion Prescriptions‚Äù for Different Knee Pain Types

# Degenerative Osteoarthritis: Repairing ‚ÄúWorn Joints‚Äù

Eleanor (from our opening) was diagnosed with bilateral degenerative knee osteoarthritis. X-rays showed narrowed joint spaces and cartilage loss. TCM diagnosis: ‚Äúliver-kidney deficiency with cold-damp obstruction‚Äù‚Äîlike an aging machine lacking lubrication, further damaged by cold.**Moxibustion Protocol**:

* **Neixiyan (Inner Knee Eye)**: Directly targets the joint cavity to relieve inner-knee pain.

* **Zusanli (ST36)**: Boosts qi and blood to provide ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù for joint repair.

Eleanor‚Äôs daughter helped her use a knee-specific moxibustion box daily, adding ginger-separated moxibustion at Zusanli. After 1 week: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need the handrail to get in bed anymore‚ÄîI used to take 5 minutes, now it‚Äôs 1.‚Äù After 2 months, her pain score dropped from 8 (severe) to 3 (mild discomfort), and she could walk her great-granddaughter around the park for 20 minutes.

# Post-Traumatic Knee Pain: Unblocking ‚ÄúStagnant Meridians‚Äù

76-year-old James fell a decade ago, and his right knee had ached on and off ever since‚Äîworse on rainy days. He had a tender spot on the inner knee. This ‚Äúblood stagnation‚Äù pain occurred when old trauma disrupted circulation, worsened by dampness.**Moxibustion Protocol**:

* **Ashi Points (Painful Areas)**: Sparrow-pecking moxibustion directly on tender spots, 15 minutes.

https://preview.redd.it/0obet0vxjppf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8986e981ca23979995c69af0dc9cc6f08d05a352

James visited the clinic 3 times weekly and used a portable moxibustion box at home. After 1 month, rainy-day pain disappeared: ‚ÄúI used to take 2 painkillers on wet days. Now I use a heating pad and moxibust for 10 minutes, then go grocery shopping like normal.‚Äù He even sent a photo of himself carrying a grocery basket, a relieved smile on his face.

# Rheumatoid Knee Pain: Dispelling ‚ÄúStubborn Cold-Dampness‚Äù

84-year-old Margaret had rheumatoid arthritis‚Äîher knees were swollen and warm, with over an hour of morning stiffness. TCM calls this ‚Äúbi syndrome‚Äù (blockage syndrome), caused by long-term cold-damp retention in the joints.

**Moxibustion Protocol**:

* **Dazhui (GV14)**: Invigorates yang energy to dispel systemic cold-dampness.

https://preview.redd.it/z37mnq7pippf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dca75ec8d78e0a14df76162aca68553e74ba08e

* **Shenshu (BL23)**: Tonifies kidneys and strengthens bones to boost joint resistance.

* **Xiyangguan (GB33)**: Loosens the knee joint and reduces stiffness.

Under medical guidance, Margaret applied cold compresses to reduce swelling before moxibustion, combined with herbal ointments. After 3 weeks, morning stiffness shrank from 90 minutes to 30, and swelling subsided: ‚ÄúI can tie my shoes now without asking the caregiver for help!‚Äù

# Senior Knee Pain Moxibustion ‚ÄúSafety Guide‚Äù

# Self-Assessment: What Type of Knee Pain Do You Have?

||
||
|Symptom|Type|Key Feature|
|Pain climbing stairs, joint clicking|Degenerative Osteoarthritis|Worsens with activity, eases with rest|
|Rainy-day pain, history of injury|Post-Traumatic Stagnation|Fixed tender spots, pain worsens with pressure|
|Swollen joints, morning stiffness|Rheumatoid Arthritis|Affects multiple joints, may include warmth|

# Safe Application Tips

* **Tool Selection**:

   * Knee-specific moxibustion boxes (curved design for a snug fit).

   * Short moxa sticks (4 inches long to prevent burns).

   * Heat-resistant pads (place under the knee to protect skin).

* **Key Acupoint Locations**:

   * Neixiyan (Inner Knee Eye): Depression on the inner side of the knee when bent (find by pressing for soreness).

   * Zusanli (ST36): Four finger-widths below the outer knee, one finger-width from the tibia (easier to locate when bent).

   * Xuehai (Sea of Blood): Bulge on the inner thigh above the knee (press for noticeable soreness).

* **Timing & Frequency**:

   * 15‚Äì20 minutes per session (avoid fatigue).

   * 3‚Äì4 times weekly (seniors have weaker qi‚Äîdon‚Äôt overdo it).

   * For acute pain (swelling/warmth): Apply cold compresses first, then moxibust after 24 hours.

# Contraindications & Precautions

1. For acute red, swollen, or hot knees (e.g., gout flares): Use cold compresses first, then moxibustion‚Äîavoid worsening inflammation.

1. Diabetics: Keep moxibustion temperature below 104¬∞F (40¬∞C) (reduced peripheral sensation increases burn risk).

1. Avoid cold water or air conditioning for 2 hours post-moxibustion (prevent re-invading cold-dampness).

1. Drink 7oz (200ml) of warm water after sessions to boost qi and blood flow.

# Beyond Pain Relief: Knee ‚ÄúMaintenance‚Äù for Seniors

At senior health lectures, caregivers often ask: ‚ÄúCan moxibustion make joints like they were when young?‚Äù I point to the old maple tree in my yard: ‚ÄúIts bark won‚Äôt be smooth again, but with good care, it still grows leaves and bears fruit. Moxibustion isn‚Äôt about ‚Äòreversing aging‚Äô‚Äîit‚Äôs about ‚Äòpain-free living.‚Äô‚ÄùMy ‚ÄúKnee Care Rhyme‚Äù for seniors:

1. **‚ÄúUse It Gently‚Äù**: Avoid stairs and kneeling (use raised toilet seats, walkers if needed).

1. **‚ÄúKeep It Warm‚Äù**: Wear long pants in summer, knee warmers in winter (avoid direct AC on knees).

1. **‚ÄúStrengthen Smart‚Äù**: Do 5 minutes of ‚Äústraight leg raises‚Äù daily (lie down, lift leg‚Äîbuilds thigh muscles to support knees).

Eleanor now does straight leg raises daily with moxibustion: ‚ÄúThe doctor said stronger thigh muscles take pressure off my knees. I can stand to make coffee now instead of waiting for the caregiver.‚Äù For seniors, that small sense of independence is the greatest joy.",1,1758107405.0,HealingWithMoxibustio,0,1.0,False

The kind where you spill coffee on your shirt, forget your keys, and then just when you think things can't get worse you‚Äôre hit with the final blow: you‚Äôre out of cereal.

Now, normally, I would just go without. But today, I was *hungry*, and by ""hungry,"" I mean my stomach was trying to eat itself from the inside out. So, I started rummaging through the kitchen, scouring every corner of the pantry like I was auditioning for ""Survivor: Kitchen Edition.""

And that‚Äôs when I found it. A dusty, half-open box of *Frosted Flakes*. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of sugary cereals‚ÄîI'm a grown adult, after all, with sophisticated tastes like‚Ä¶ well, coffee and regret. But this box was the last option, so I grabbed it.

As soon as I opened it, I realized something was off. The flakes had formed into a *perfect* pyramid inside the box. And by perfect, I mean like the kind of pyramid that could be used to signal aliens or to summon a cereal-based deity. It was way too symmetrical for my taste.

Naturally, my first thought was, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way this is normal. This is a conspiracy.‚Äù

I poured myself a bowl and stared at the flakes. They were glistening like they had been *polished*. I shook the box, and the pyramid didn‚Äôt budge. It was as if these flakes had made a pact to never let anyone disturb their ancient formation. Suspicious, I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs test this.‚Äù

I took the box into the living room and set it on the coffee table, then walked away for a solid ten minutes. When I came back, the pyramid was *still* intact. That‚Äôs when I started to get paranoid. Was this some kind of cereal sentience? Were the flakes conspiring to get rid of me and take over my kitchen?

I picked up a flake and examined it closely. It had no holes. No dents. No flaws. It was too perfect. I placed it on the counter next to my phone and set the timer for 30 seconds. I stared at the flake like it was a ticking bomb. And then... *nothing* happened. It just sat there, staring back at me, mocking me with its unwavering perfection.

So, I did what any sane person would do in this situation: I grabbed the entire box, walked outside, and buried it in the backyard.

Now, every time I walk past the spot, I wonder: Did I do the right thing? Or did I just interrupt the most peaceful cereal rebellion of all time?

I sing and play acoustic guitar. As I kid, I used to do music, theater, dance, jewelries, drawing, storytelling, photography, everything. Also as a teenager, I was very curious to learn about biology, geography, philosophy, anatomy, languages; things that made sense in real world and life.

But unfortunately, I was also academically very successful at even the subjects that I don't care about (math, physics). Ended up in one of the best high schools in the country. At this point I should mention that I'm from Turkey where the academic pressure is very high, and other peoples opinion matter immensely. 

Not explicitly but, at the end of high school, I had to choose between being an engineer vs a doctor. I thought being an engineer would give me a bit more time to myself after work & weekends, so I ended up studying something that I hated but still good at it.

Didn't want to work as an engineer so i left to Portugal to study something ""softer"" aka a masters degree on data science and ended up publishing my thesis. I taught at the uni for 3 years and loved it so much. Interacting with the students was amazing as opposed to doing research on my laptop. Every class I taught was a performance for me. I loved my teaching persona. This misled me to think that I wanted to be a Prof at the university. I started a PhD in Ai in Italy where I am now. It is actually going good cause I am a responsible person in nature so I keep publishing (I actually love giving presentations at conferences, it makes me happy -not because of the topic though, i love the act of presenting-) and researching. 

But there isn't a single day that I think I am living a life defying my nature. I am not a scientist or engineer in my soul. I have always been an artist. But I lost all my creativity while studying non stop. 

I am still singing, playing, choir-ing, dancing. But just as hobbies. I had a band in high school, some tiny concerts. I also performed solo in coffee shops, bars, open mics and received many compliments. I always promised myself to record myself -the last 15 years!!!-, share on YouTube, Instagram, whatever, but always something got in the way or I thought I was not good enough or I had depression (I had 3 major depressions in the last 10 years). 

Now, I am too into the PhD to quit (also I need the scholarship money)(also what would I say to my parents, they worked too hard to support my education), don't have any technical music education and not good enough at music; so I'm just stuck. 

I cried over million times thinking I should have done everything, anything else, except what I'm doing. I could teach languages, I could do a PhD in something exciting, meaningful, I could be a musician, I could do musicals, I even thought au pair or cleaning! I feel better cleaning my house than coming to work every day. 

I keep telling myself, once I get my PhD, I'll turn my life around but what does that even mean? I don't want to end up with a wasted life in the sense of it was lived in a way that wasn't right to my existence/personality/soul.

Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever feel like life is a video game but you missed the tutorial? Some people just seem to be gliding through on a higher difficulty setting with ease. The secret? They've found the cheat codes.

I'm not talking about hacks or shortcuts to cheat the system. I'm talking about small, almost invisible habits and mindsets that completely change the game. They're the little optimizations that stack up to create massive results.

Here are a few I've been using that have genuinely leveled up my daily experience:

*   **The ""One-Touch"" Rule:** For any item you use (a book, a coffee mug, your keys), put it back in its designated home immediately after you're done. No more ""I'll do it later."" This single-handedly eliminates 90% of my daily clutter and the mental drain that comes with it.
*   **The ""Energy Audit"" Buff:** Instead of just managing your time, manage your *energy*. Notice what people, places, and tasks give you energy vs. which ones drain you. Then, structure your day to do the draining stuff when your energy is highest. It's a total game-changer for productivity.
*   **The ""Walk & Talk"" Quest:** If you have a phone call or a virtual meeting where you don't need to be on camera, take it while walking. You get steps in, clear your head, and often think more creatively. It turns a sedentary task into a health boost.

The goal isn't to become a productivity robot. It's the opposite. It's about optimizing the boring stuff so you have more time, energy, and mental space for what actually brings you **joy and fulfillment**.

Of course, sometimes the biggest system we need to optimize is our own mind. The constant grind can be emotionally draining, and if you're feeling stuck on that front, untangling those feelings can feel impossible without a map. I've personally found that when the internal stuff is messy, no amount of external optimization works. If you're looking for a structured way to handle that, a lot of people get real value from **[this resource (affiliate link)]** to help map out their emotional well-being and get back on track.

It's all about those small, intentional upgrades. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Just find one small ""cheat code"" and try it out.

So, what's a hidden cheat code you've discovered that's made a real difference in your life? Let's share the wealth! üëá",1,1758107006.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

One of them told us that today in the park, she was complimented on by a guy about some thrifted/vintage outfit she was wearing. They ended up talking for a few minutes and left it at that. She mentioned she really enjoyed getting the compliment and it made her day. The other girl, however mentioned she would feel really uncomfortable if someone approached her on the street and gave her a compliment.

As I am a man this led me to think is it rude/uncomfortable to receive compliments as a girl? I personally approach someone from time to time (0-2 times a month) and give out a compliment. For me the majority of these times is actually a genuine compliment and sometimes I even leave straight afterwards; e.g. if I am cycling I sometimes compliment someone at a crossroad on their outfit since it actually looks cool, but immediately end up driving away afterwards.

Now I am aware that it obviously depends on the tone, the setting as well as your message on how the compliment is received. In addition complimenting someone on their looks, goes more in the direction of flirting with someone or hitting on someone, rather than a genuine compliment.

However, this led me to question, is what I am doing considered to be rude? Would you appreciate to get approached by someone random on the street, coffee shop, or the park or do you feel annoyed or in the worst case even harassed?

So we ended up at a little caf√© with iced lattes. He looked different, lighter, almost glowing, like the sun had finally reached him again. We talked about his new office, his hopes, and even joked about the awkward interviews he had survived.

As we sat there, I realized it wasn‚Äôt about the coffee at all. It was about witnessing someone you care about step back into their life. The moment was simple, but it felt huge.

Check out my Natural Bodybuilding Transformation. I put on 40lbs of muscle using intensity techniques‚Äîno PEDs, just training, consistency, progressive overload, and going ham every set.

Started as a 130lb ectomorph, discouraged after my early teen attempts flopped (couldn't get past 150). Thought natural gains were impossible, quit for 10 years. Then researched deep, restarted with stairs for that cognitive edge at first (7 days/week, 15min x3 up 25 floors, sprinting the last for dopamine boosts to crush knowledge work).

Progressed to hypertrophy: Chicken legs blown . Now at 170lbs \~9% BF, going for 180lbs 8%.

**My Intensity-Based Hypertrophy Philosophy (The Secret Sauce):**

It's not about ego-lifts or max weights‚Äîmuscle responds to stimulus: Intensity, time under tension (TUT), full ROM, and failure. As naturals, we gotta maximize protein synthesis with zero reps in reserve. Go hard every set; the last reps count most. Progressive overload is king: Log reps/weights meticulously (phone notes), fight for +1 rep or match last with timed rests (1:30-2:30min).

Tried bro splits, 7-day a week, reps in reserve‚Äîwas OK. But every other day is when i got real gains, after watching Dorian Yates speeches (up the rest and up the intensity)

Switched to every-other-day but upped the intensity (supersets, drop sets, push to failure) and crushed 40lbs gains. Most of it was put on in 24 months.

Routine: Day 1 - Chest/Back; Off; Day 3 - Arms (Shoulders/Bis/Tris); Day 4: off, Day 5 - Legs;

Alternate calves/traps for accessory muscle work at start of gym sessions., with 2 min planks for core stability

**Key Intensity Techniques (My Arsenal):**

* **LPRs (Lengthened Partial Reps):**¬†After failure, 5-20 quarter/half reps at the stretch (most anabolic spot).
* **Drop Sets:**¬†Fail, drop 10-20lbs, reps again‚Äîtotal exhaustion.
* **Supersets:**¬†with any combo, drop-sets, super sets, run-down-the-rack style drop-sets, super-sets with partial reps, etc. heavy into super sets, static holds, rest-pause super sets.
* **Rest Pauses:**¬†3-5sec breaks mid-set to hit targets rep ranges
* **Static Holds:**¬†Burn at the stretch.

**Sample Leg Day:**¬†Calves (20reps ignition set + multi-dropsets w/LPRs), 2x supersets leg extensions (36reps + 16 LPRs), leg press 2x (20reps w/drops), 6x sets hack squats x 20 reps (full ROM, duck stance for quads‚Äî""ATG"" style).

**Sample Chest/Back**: Traps supersets w/statics, 3x pull-ups (15-18 clean w/LPRs +5 each set), seated rows (1x triple dropset after 1x ignition set 20 reps), 3x deadlifts 10 rep range recent addition (takes former spot of lat prayers super set), bench 3x set (drop set), dips (super deep stretch + super swith with LPR, only 5 reps done in slow tempo, but to maximum, chest ripping stretch point).

**Nutrition & Recovery (Fuel the Beast):**  
3 p. shakes/day: Bullet blender with 1/4 cup choc milk ea, 1/3 banana, scoop oatmeal, scoop protein, scoop creatine (15g+ total/day for ATP/brain‚Äîbeyond outdated 5g). Shakes = convenient full amino profile, absorbs best. Overall: Clean-ish, high protein (6 eggs in AM, 3 yolks thrown out). Eggs + 3xShake = Base diet, then I eat selectively depending on what's available + 4x coffee per day (for focus)

I like to log my #of sets in an excel sheet. This is my ""canvas"", gives me something tangible for my work, i.e. credit. Gamifies the process, i can run metrics on it (1678 workouts completed, 14 604 sets completed \[...\]). I do count super sets and drop sets as multiple sets (hence the high set counts) i.e. Bench Press x3 dropset, each with drop set = 6 sets in my count, because those drop sets are arguably better than the primary i want to count them, and I do count one set of 20 rep ATG hack squats as \*3 sets\* (cuz, that's just how i do it, they suck bad, so i need more credit for them, they work well though for growth) so 6 sets of 20 rep hack squats i log as 18 sets.",0,1758105025.0,workout,1,0.5,False

 I‚Äôm considering buying an electric grinder and have two choices: 

1) purchase an 8-10k grinder suitable for pour overs, or 

2) buy a >15k grinder suitable for a home espresso setup. 

Option 1 saves money, but I may regret it if I switch to espresso making in the future.

Still researching for grinders, so if you have a recommendation for a under 10k grinder that‚Äôs great for pour over/aeropress, but also decent enough for espresso, pls share.

I‚Äôm looking to be talked in or out of upgrading my modded Gaggia Classic Pro for a Rancilio Silvia Pro X.

I have had the Gaggia for approx 3 years now and in that period added a shades of coffee PID, 9 bar spring and steamer upgrade. I enjoy the coffee I get from it, but am finding the limitations of a single boiler more irritating as time passes.

As a result I am considering upgrading to the Rancilio, but considering the cost (¬£1300), I am wondering how much difference it will actually make.

For context, most days I make flat whites mostly for myself. But frequently I make them for others too. When I make them for others I find I accident it by habit switch on the steamer after pulling my shot. Which then means a long wait for the temp to settle back to pull additional shots. I appreciate I could concentrate on getting my work flow right, but it does also highlight how much easier things would be with a dual boiler machine. Especially as I‚Äôm not overly impressed by the steamer upgrade for the Gaggia.

In terms of other functionality, I don‚Äôt ever alter the settings on the PID. I just use the recommended values. I brought it mostly to ensure consistent temperature rather than the ability to tinker with settings. I have no real desire to experiment with infusions etc. unless it is very simple to do.

Has anyone else made the switch? Did having a dual boiler make enough difference to justify the cost?",1,1758104791.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1nj9d1p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nj9d1p,Hello all! Is my little kitty alright?,"Hello ! I just joined this subreddit and usually don't even come on here that often, but it is 3:10 am and I am desperate. My family and I recently rescued this 2-3 month old Siamese kitten off the streets from a violent dog neighborhood and I've been growing concerned if i'm overfeeding her somehow or if she has worms. I've read up a lot about it but I am having trouble finding if it's the cause or if she's just too skinny still. We cannot afford a vet again as we live in Cali and have low-income but not enough for any support. We also already have another pet that we are taking care of at the vet and paying a lot for. We took her to the vet the first time to get her checked out, but it was a very understaffed pro-bono clinic far, far away and they could only do so much. They asked us to monitor her poopies and behavior if she had worms and  gave us a pill for the month incase we saw any. I lead a busy life in college so I cannot check her poop 24/7 and my teenage brother is grossed out to do it (lol). I walked her outside in our yard and she pooped twice, but I saw no rice grains or worms at all. We have been feeding her LiveClear (since I am allergic to cats' f1 gene -- but surprisingly not at all for her!) and wet food that the vet themself gave us. They also said she had an infection in her eyes and lung and gave us medicine for it which we have been doing around the clock as instructed. Her eye boogies are now gone but she still coughs a little.

I'm having trouble because many of the symptoms list lethargy, lack of interest, increased appetite, dull coats, etc etc. This is my first cat EVER  and I am very on top of everything for her since I am a bit paranoid. She is super cuddly with me and follows me everywhere and purrs EXTREMELY loud to the point it freaked me out and i had to ask my friend who had cats if it was okay! I don't know what is a potbelly and what is healthy for her skinny frame to catch up with the food we've been giving her. We've had her for about 3\~ days and she seems relatively fine and plays with us. The messy room in the pictures is all of the stuff she has messed around with or knocked down for fun. She's extremely vocal as I read up on about Siameses' but sometimes her meows are silent or whispery. I haven't used the worm pill yet since I haven't spotted any worms in her stool, but she usually poops whenever I am not home and my brother scoops it up right away. When we found her on the street, she had fleas, which she was given a pill for and we gave her a bath as soon as we got home. She hasn't had any since, and I even checked her butt, which had coffee-ground like things around the rim which I believe is her poopies. Sometimes she nips at her fur and bites her back or belly -- but I'm not sure if it's worms or normal cat behavior. I do not want anything bad to happen to her so I am debating just giving her the pill regardless to make sure everything's covered and alright -- but I'm not sure if it'll hurt her. She was also EXTREMELY skinny and still is slight, but has gained some weight I have noticed.

We leave her pebble LiveClear food out in the ""free feeding"" tips I've seen, and feed her small portions of wet food 2-3 times per day. Sometimes we will give her a treat (one of those gogurt looking strips? we got them for free at a pet store) but that's about it. She doesn't eat everything in one sitting, and actively will stop if she's full and then come back later in the day. She has been drinking water regularly and seems to behave normally. I also haven't noticed any little pellets or dried worm eggs in my bed where she sits or in her own bed. Am I freaking out for no reason? Please help me out! She is the love of my life!

edit: I did try to weigh her but our scale didn't think she existed! It's a weird glass one with I presume the weight calculated from the corners being applied with pressure. But I assume she's too light for it. I gave her the Milpro I was given just incase upon further research -- there is also a small blue/gray/purpleish patch on her belly? No clue what that is. Hoping to take her to the vet soon.",16,1758104742.0,Siamesecats,0,0.95,False
