1mcclpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mcclpy/my_neighbors_husband_left_today_and_it_turned/,My neighbor’s husband left today and it turned into a full-on daytime soap opera,"At first, I thought someone left their TV too loud. But then I realized the yelling was real and it was coming from outside. I peeked out my front window and saw my neighbor standing on the porch barefoot, in her pajama pants and a tank top, screaming at her husband.

He was dragging a giant suitcase to his car and completely ignoring her. She was yelling things like:

“So you’re just gonna walk out after everything?!” “Be a man for once and say it to my face!” “You’ll regret this when she leaves you too!”

Yes. She.

Not even ten minutes after the husband sped off (and I mean sped off - tires screeched), another car pulls up. A silver BMW. Out steps her sister - dressed like she just came from a casting for brunch in Beverly Hills.

I’m not even kidding, my jaw dropped.

The neighbor storms off the porch and yells, “Of course you show up now.”
The sister fires right back “He needed someone who listens to him for once!”

Y’all. I choked on my iced coffee.

They start going at it - yelling, finger-pointing, my neighbor even pushes the sister's shoulder at one point. I had one foot out the door ready to break it up if it got physical. I'm texting my husband trying to kepe him updated on whats going on. And in the middle of all this, the neighbor screams at her, “He was my husband. And you were supposed to be my sister!”

The sister responds in the calmest way after all the yelling, “He told me you would do this.” then she straight up gets in the car and leaves. I think my neighbor is just too shocked to do anything she kinda just watches her in shock also calming down from the yelling. I’m thinking everything is starting to kick in?

After her sister left she just stood on the porch for a solid five minutes then just went back inside. I’m thinking its over and that was enough excitement for one day.

Nope.

Half an hour later I hear glass clinking loudly out of my office window. I look past our side yard and onto her side of the fence. I’m upstairs so I can see pretty much everything. SHes outside again. Thus time tossing empty wine bottles into her trash one by one. Shes doing this slowly and dramatically as if she wanted someone to hear?

She finally sat down on the curb and lit a cigarette. First time I’ve ever seen her smoke. My cat and I just sat in the window watching like it was a season finale.

No one’s been back to the house. Her husband’s car is still gone. Her sister hasn’t returned. She (my neighbor) closed all the blinds, and it’s been silent ever since.

I don’t know if I just witnessed a cheating scandal, a sister betrayal, a midlife crisis, or all three at once. But I do know I’m making popcorn tomorrow in case there’s a part two.

UPDATE: Thank you all for the replies and advice for this situation. I have never had a post get so much attention and tbh not entirely sure if I’m updating this post properly by just editing and adding onto it… but here’s what happened tonight.

Okay, so like I mentioned in the original post - I decided to check on her tonight. Brought a plate of pasta, some steak we made, and garlic bread. Nothing fancy, just something warm. My husband also made some brownies earlier today so I had to add those, because she deserved some, lol. I wasn’t planning to stay long - or at all - just drop her off a meal like I mentioned.

When I walked over, she answered the door pretty quickly. I was scared she might think I was someone else and blow up on me. I sorta braced myself, lol.

Poor thing looked drained, to say the least. But she smiled a little when she saw the food and said, “You didn’t have to do that.”

She had me come in. Mind you, I’ve been in her house maybe once or twice before.

Her house was dim. We sat down at her kitchen table - her drink was already poured, so… yeah. I asked her how she was doing. Not specifically referencing anything. And she just kind of exhaled.

Basically…

She confirmed what most of us were already thinking: her husband and her sister have been hooking up behind her back. She found out by accident — saw a message pop up on his iPad and it all unraveled from there. She confronted him, he confessed, chaos ensued. That was the shouting match I witnessed.

But then she started telling me more… and it kind of shifted the vibe.

She said - and I quote - “I mean, yeah, I made it really easy for him to cheat. I haven’t been emotionally available for months.” She said some more stuff I can’t fully quote word for word but basically along the lines of saying she was focusing on herself and knew he was feeling neglected/ignored, but - “I just didn’t think he’d be that dumb.”

Okay, starting to feel less like a telenovela and more like real life.

Then she acknowledged her sister. So it’s confirmed - yes, it was the sister. She explained that they’ve always gone back and forth and claimed that her sister has always been jealous of her. There’s always been an element of competition.

She made it sound like they weren’t close as adults, and honestly it felt like she had come to terms with the sister part and was just upset with her husband at this point.

She also admitted she had already emotionally checked out of the marriage months ago, but stayed because she “wasn’t about to be the one to call it.” Said she “likes the upper hand in every exit.” Which… kudos to her, because she was sitting at her kitchen table admitting all this to her neighbor.

Y’all. I was just sitting there, nodding, trying to take it all in.

She talked for like twenty straight minutes. Barely paused. Honestly? It started sounding less like a heartbroken woman and more like someone who’d been strategizing damage control since the minute things blew up. She even said she told her mom not to call her sister to “make it clear who the family was siding with.”

But, taking into account their relationship and background, it made sense for that reaction. There was a lot of emotion brewing in this situation.

So yeah, he cheated. The sister crossed a line. But I’m going to be honest - the longer she talked, the more I realized… she’s not just a victim here. The whole situation is messy. Every single person involved is somehow in the wrong.

And the wild part? I still don’t know who messed up more - the sister or the husband.

I feel like this was poorly explained on my part and is going to get a lot of backlash, because reading this back it sounds like she is still the victim. But I don’t know how to properly convey to you the way she used her words and her tone. There was a sense of… evil, for lack of a better word. An almost calm acknowledgment of the fact that she knew this was going to happen — like it wasn’t if, but when.

Some other stuff we now have answers to:

Husband: Still gone. Staying with someone (she rolled her eyes when she said it, so I’m guessing yes, it’s the sister).

Sister: Hasn’t reached out. She blocked her. (I think we all saw this coming.)

Neighbor: Playing strong. Seems like she’s accepted the fact of the matter.

Me: Confused and tired.

One last thing:

Before I left, she said something that kind of stuck with me:

“At least I didn’t lose anything important. Just two people I outgrew anyway.”

And maybe that’s her way of coping… or maybe that’s just who she is. Either way, it was a whole different version of events than I was expecting.",1,1753798535.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

1mccjqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mccjqa/im_the_maid/,I’m the maid,"Our house will comfortably accommodate a fairly large crowd. We have five bedrooms and three baths.  Every summer my husband invites his family to stay for two weeks. The whole time, all I do is cook and clean and nobody offers to help. My husband pays for all the food, even when we go out to eat. He will grab the check and his family will allow him to do it. I am expected to cook every meal when we don’t eat out. My mother-in-law will ask “What are you making for dinner? I just love your cooking! I’d be so fat if I lived with you!” I spend all day every day washing dishes, wiping countertops, picking up after everyone, doing laundry (constant loads of towels) and vacuuming. No one makes their beds, even though I don’t go as far as that, but I do collect towels from bathrooms (usually from the floor). My sister in law used my washer for her own clothes three days ago and I found them in my dryer. I put them in a basket for her and put them on top of the dryer. They’re still there. I clean the pool every single morning when I get up and collect beach towels that were left laying outside. They stay up until three am watching tv together and having great fun, even though each bedroom has its own tv. They keep me awake, but my husband can sleep through anything. He goes to work each morning and I get up to clean the mess left in the kitchen from their late night snacking. When they get up, they expect breakfast at different times of the day, then use our pool. Our house is their two week vacation every year. I’ve got a week left.  I truly hate these people. I’m not asking what to do. I know most will say this is on my husband. It is. I hate confrontation, and I’m not going to fight with him while his family is here. When they leave, I’m going to let him have it with both barrels. If he decides to keep up this tradition,I will be going on my own personal vacation while they are at my house. I joined this group to vent. I had to get it out while the slobs are all sleeping and I’m sipping my coffee before starting another day of cooking and cleaning.  I’ve let this go on for far too many years. This is the last. Thanks for reading. ",1,1753798409.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Is this cheating?,"For context So my GF is a ‘40F’I am ‘42M’ we have known each other for a few years as friends and official for 7 months. she is very fit and attractive. She works as a massage therapist. I don’t mind the fact she has many male clients. Don’t mind when they hit on her as she’s very hot and most men probably would find her attractive. 
There is construction going on for months now in front of her house. 
Back in March she mentioned out of no wear that one of the construction workers were hitting on her. She said it was disgusting. But went on and on about his house up north on a lake. His truck and the fact he’s a Fireman enough to show it was more than a quick convo. 
The weekend she told me she brought it him twice. She also said she never gets hit on. And I asked her well what about that construction worker. She blushed and said “oh baby you have my heart” any way that’s all fine. But she mentioned she was disgusted by him. A few weeks later she said he approached her again and she gave him a dirty look and went on her way. Well now 3-4 months later we are camping. And I see she’s got a text message from him on her lock screen( I have her code but don’t go on her phone) 
The day after camping  I go to her place and we are laying in bed. She’s kinda horny. And we are cuddling and messing around a bit. Then she brings up this guy again. Said she treated him in her massage clinic a while ago. She said she was talking to him in the treatment and she was talking so much about me. And he mentioned he was doing Reno’s. So she asked and he’s building a sex room in his place. He asked if she was interested and she said no. So he asked if she could set him up with her room mate. Her room mate said no but agreed to coffee. 
At some point she exchanged numbers with this guy and agreed to massage him. She’s not short of customers or money. Is that cheating. She talked so poorly of him but exchanged numbers. He also texted this weekend but she said she treated him a while ago. 
Is this cheating or a red flag. I want to get your opinion before I talk to her?

1mccgdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1mccgdo/iykyk/,IYKYK,"First off, I don’t like that expression at all, in general: “If You Know, You Know.”  Not only is it cutesy, but it’s intentionally excluding people, it’s creating a club of insiders, if you don’t recognize this reference to anime/comic books/cult show/pop star/etc then YOU’RE NOT ONE OF US.

(Could my annoyance at seeing IYKYK in the wild have anything to do with the fact that I never Know??  Anyway…)

I’m using IYKYK for caregiving just to look at how difficult it is for most people who haven’t been through it to understand it.  

For example, when you first meet someone, a common conversation starter is where they’re from, where they’ve lived.  I moved abruptly 13 years ago (thousands of miles) to take care of my parents when they suddenly needed it.  If someone asks me where I’ve lived, and I mention that move and why I did it, I can immediately tell whether they’ve had any experience with caregiving.  If they have, we understand each other on some level.  If they haven’t, I may as well have told them I used to fly by flapping my arms really hard – they just don’t get it.  They don't Know.

I don’t hate them for this.  I really don’t.  (Envy, maybe, but not hate.)  Not everyone is put in this position.  I wouldn't wish it on anyone, though I don't bother grudging being in it.  And until you’ve been in this position, you just can’t understand it, you can’t understand how it can suck away your life force, your emotions, your spirit.

And obviously, plenty of people have had other horrible, horrible experiences that I can’t grasp.

I’m not religious but I used to take my mother to her church.  Afterward, in the coffee hour, I would encounter people who understood something of my situation.  They Knew.  I feel like as we get more isolated, we’re losing touch with the connections to local people who Know what we’re going through.

I’m not trying to say we’re special.  We didn’t choose to be part of this club.  And we’re certainly not trying to exclude anyone from this club – you want to help, how’s Saturday afternoon?!

We got together shortly after my ex dumped me because I wanted to transition from male to female. She was subleasing from one of my roommates for the summer and we just really hit it off. We fell for each other very quickly. We spent tons of time together and moved in with each other after a year. She has been very supportive of my transition and has stuck by me through some of the most difficult and transformative years of my life. And to top it off she is an absolute smoke show lol.

I know every couple has disagreements and fights, and I have had a pretty easy life. But honestly, this relationship has been both the most rewarding and the most stressful thing to ever happen to me. She makes me feel really valued and protected. For example, last week we were at a bar celebrating our friend's birthday. One of their friends was talking to me for a few minutes before fiance and I went to order our drinks, and she told me she was going to kick her ass if she didn't leave me alone. I don't think this girl was being flirtatious with me at all but I am oblivious to that stuff, and to be honest I kind of enjoy how protective she is. She has been correct about my friends having crushes on me in the past as well, so I really want to take her seriously if she gets a bad feeling about something.

The flip side is that I am always on edge when she comes home because I am worried she will come home angry about work or be unhappy about something being out of place in our apartment. If I go out and bring an empty coffee cup, or I set a bag with a few vegetables from the farmer's market on the table, she asks me why I never tell her what I am doing. If I see my friends while she is at work, she is upset when she gets home or something dramatic happens at work that demands 100 percent of my attention. I can't think of the last time there we didn't some kind of argument when I hang out with my friends. I also feel that I am sometimes subtly accused of cheating, and she always thinks I am talking shit about her to my friends when I genuinely have only had nice things to say about her. When I express my feelings about these things it turns into a fight 100 percent of the time because I stg we were both meant to be lawyers or something. We both just want to be right. The fighting has improved because we are both a bit more self-aware, and neither of us want to hurt the other, but it still happens at least twice a week.

I just feel so overwhelmed. I love her so much and no one has ever made me feel loved like she does. But I always feel like I am walking on egg shells. I flinch when she opens the door. I just feel so emotionally overwhelmed. All I want to do is listen to her and make her happy but I feel like I am always falling short. Is this like... normal???? How do I get her to trust me more?",1,1753797991.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

You might find it referred to as Aqua Sculpt Pills, Aqua Sculpt Supplement, or Aqua Sculpt Weight Loss Formula. It’s been making waves on platforms like Amazon, Reddit, and TikTok, with many people sharing their experiences and results.  The supplement comes in the form of a simple, once-daily capsule, designed to help target stubborn fat, particularly in areas like the belly, thighs, and hips. Aqua Sculpt works by helping to activate your body’s natural thermogenic processes, making it easier to burn calories without needing to completely overhaul your diet or exercise routine. While a lot of users report positive results, it’s important to remember that everyone’s experience can be different, and Aqua Sculpt should never replace professional medical advice or treatment.

  
**The Ice Water Hack That’s Trending in 2025 – And Why It Pairs Naturally with AquaSculpt**

The term “Ice Water Hack” has taken over wellness forums, TikTok trends, and YouTube routines in 2025 – and for good reason. This seemingly simple habit of drinking cold water immediately upon waking has become one of the most talked-about metabolism hacks of the year. But while it may sound like just another viral moment, the science and structure behind it reveals why it’s more than a passing trend – and why AquaSculpt users are paying attention.

**What Is the Ice Water Hack?**

At its core, the Ice Water Hack involves drinking 8 to 12 ounces of cold (often ice-filled) water as the very first action upon waking up – ideally before coffee, food, or supplements.

**This approach works on three synergistic principles:**

* **Cold-Induced Thermogenesis**: The body expends energy to warm the cold water to core temperature, resulting in a modest but meaningful metabolic activation – without stimulants.
* **Rehydration Efficiency**: After 6-9 hours of sleep-related fluid loss, immediate rehydration helps jumpstart digestion, organ function, and overall cellular efficiency.
* **Pre-Meal Satiety Signaling**: Cold water pre-loads the stomach, which may help reduce appetite and support better food decisions early in the day.

These effects are magnified when combined with a gentle metabolic supplement like AquaSculpt – which is designed to enhance internal energy rhythms, glucose optimization, and cellular fat utilization.

**Why AquaSculpt Users Are Adopting the Ice Water Hack**

What began as a viral TikTok ritual has quickly evolved into a standard wellness protocol among those using AquaSculpt for long-term weight support.

**Here’s why:**

* **Stack-Compatible Routine**: The Ice Water Hack doesn’t require timing conflicts with AquaSculpt. In fact, many users take one AquaSculpt capsule with their ice water to maximize the gentle thermogenic pairing.
* **Amplifies Metabolic On-Ramp**: AquaSculpt is formulated to work best in rhythm with the body’s natural energy curves. Cold hydration first thing in the morning syncs with AquaSculpt’s formulation logic, helping users “activate” in a stimulant-free way.
* **Promotes Daily Habit Anchoring**: Adding the Ice Water Hack creates a behavioral trigger – a simple habit that reminds users to take their supplement consistently, which is key for AquaSculpt’s long-term effects.
* **Clean-Label Compatibility**: Just like AquaSculpt avoids harsh stimulants, the Ice Water Hack is natural, safe, and sustainable. Together, they represent a new wave of non-invasive weight management: low-friction habits, high-impact synergy.

**The Ice Water Hack: Science, Anecdotes, and Strategic Use**

Scientific discussions around the Ice Water Hack remain active in 2025, with nutritionists, metabolic researchers, and performance coaches highlighting its thermogenic and behavioral benefits.

**Recent wellness publications report:**

* Up to a 30% spike in resting metabolic rate observed in small trials after cold fluid consumption in the morning
* Improvements in daily hydration habits, which correlate with more stable blood sugar and appetite control
* Increased adherence to supplement routines, thanks to the structured cue that the Ice Water Hack provides

A recent feature, “Ice Water Hack Ingredients Under Review”, explores the cold water trend in depth and explains how supplements like AquaSculpt are specifically structured to enhance its metabolic effects.

Influencers and affiliate reviewers frequently pair their Ice Water Hack tutorials with transparent supplement stacks – and AquaSculpt has emerged as a consistent favorite. Unlike caffeine-loaded fat burners, AquaSculpt doesn’t create conflict with cold water intake or early-morning use.

In fact, TikTok users have begun coining the phrase: **“Ice + Aqua = Sculpt.”**

This catchphrase reflects a growing pairing strategy: using the Ice Water Hack to kickstart the day, and AquaSculpt to support metabolic alignment throughout it.

**How to Pair the Ice Water Hack With AquaSculpt**

**Morning Routine (0-15 Minutes After Waking):**

* Drink 10 ounces of ice-cold water – optional squeeze of lemon for taste and electrolyte balance
* Take 1 capsule of AquaSculpt with the water – no food required
* Light movement or stretch (optional) – to enhance circulation and metabolic “wake-up”
* Wait 20-30 minutes before breakfast or coffee – allowing AquaSculpt and the hydration signal to initiate energy flow naturally

This simple 4-step sequence is now seen across YouTube morning routine videos, TikTok reels, and affiliate wellness blogs – often cited as a no-crash, no-burn, long-game solution.

**From Trend to Strategy: Why AquaSculpt Is the Engine**

While trends come and go, metabolic sustainability requires a longer vision. The Ice Water Hack is the entry point, the low-friction gateway into healthier routines. But it’s AquaSculpt that delivers the structural, ingredient-level support that consumers need to see real, sustainable progress.

Both are powerful on their own. But together, they represent a modern metabolic pairing that aligns with 2025’s shift toward daily, data-backed wellness systems.

No crashes. No stimulants. No hype-heavy burnout.

Just daily clarity, hydration, and balance – all anchored by AquaSculpt’s proven support model.

A recent article titled “Aqua Sculpt Complaints Investigated” evaluated user concerns and re-validated the product’s role as a long-term metabolic ally. It also highlighted how structured morning routines such as the Ice Water Hack play a key role in repeat usage success.

A follow-up review titled “Aqua Sculpt Reviewed: Explore the Shocking Science Behind AquaSculpt” offers a deep dive into AquaSculpt’s unique approach to metabolism support. It explains the logic behind AquaSculpt’s clean-label formulation, non-stimulant ingredient stack, and how its gradual, habit-based design compares favorably to older-generation fat burners. This article further reinforces AquaSculpt’s rising status in the clean wellness space and complements the Ice Water Hack perfectly by showcasing why structured routines are outperforming short-term solutions.

**Frequently Asked Questions: Ice Water Hack + AquaSculpt Integration**

**Is the Ice Water Hack effective without AquaSculpt?**  
Yes. The Ice Water Hack offers modest thermogenic and hydration benefits on its own. However, many users report improved metabolic consistency and better appetite control when pairing the practice with AquaSculpt’s structured, non-stimulant formulation.

**What temperature should the water be for maximum effect?**  
Ideally, the water should be between 35°F and 50°F – cold enough to activate the body’s internal heating response without causing discomfort. Ice-filled water is most commonly used to achieve this range.

**Should AquaSculpt be taken on an empty stomach?**  
Most users tolerate AquaSculpt well in a fasted state and take it immediately after waking with cold water. Those with sensitive digestion may prefer to follow up with a light breakfast or smoothie.

**Can AquaSculpt be used twice daily?**  
Yes. The standard dosage allows for one to two capsules per day. Many users split this across morning and early afternoon. Always follow the label instructions and consult a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations.

**Can AquaSculpt be taken with coffee?**  
Yes. Because AquaSculpt is stimulant-free, it can be safely paired with coffee. Some users wait 30 to 60 minutes after their morning dose to consume caffeine in order to assess tolerance and routine impact.

**Is AquaSculpt intended for short-term or long-term use?**  
AquaSculpt is designed for long-term metabolic support. Reviewers often report best outcomes over 90 days or more. It is not a crash-solution or rapid-fat-loss product, but rather a structured metabolism tool intended for sustained use.

**Is this combination appropriate for older adults or those with health sensitivities?**  
Many older adults favor AquaSculpt for its gentleness and lack of harsh stimulants. The Ice Water Hack is also generally well-tolerated, though those with underlying conditions should consult a healthcare professional before adopting any new health routine.

**Bonus Integration Tips: Maximizing AquaSculpt’s Effectiveness**

Thousands of AquaSculpt users and affiliate reviewers have contributed tips to help streamline the integration of AquaSculpt and the Ice Water Hack into daily routines. Below are some of the most effective:

* Prepare your capsule and full glass of ice water the night before and place it bedside for automatic compliance.
* Consider adding lemon or a small pinch of sea salt to your cold water to support electrolyte balance and early digestion.
* Track your intake using a habit app or physical journal for improved consistency over 30-, 60-, or 90-day cycles.
* Pair the routine with early light movement (e.g., walking, stretching) to compound metabolic engagement.
* Keep an AquaSculpt capsule in your work bag for consistent second-dose timing when needed.

These micro-optimizations reflect the broader 2025 trend toward habit-based systems that emphasize behavior, not just biology.

**Pros and Cons of the AquaSculpt + Ice Water Hack Routine**

**Pros**

* Simple and structured routine that supports consistency
* Compatible with fasted use, daily schedules, and morning rituals
* Free from stimulants, synthetic additives, or habit-forming ingredients
* Can be safely stacked with common supplements such as probiotics, collagen, and omega-3s
* Supported by affiliate reviewers, long-term users, and platform comparisons
* Aligned with current behavioral and metabolic science research
* Appeals to both first-time supplement users and experienced wellness consumers

**Cons**

* Requires ongoing use and consistency for best results
* Not intended for rapid weight loss or crash dieting
* May be less effective without some degree of dietary and lifestyle support
* Individuals with sensitivity to cold exposure may need to adjust the Ice Water Hack parameters

This routine reflects a maturing weight support market: one that favors sustainable, compoundable tools over short-lived trends or intensity-based cycles.

**Final Summary and Call to Action**

The Ice Water Hack has surged in popularity because of its simplicity, safety, and alignment with the body’s natural energy systems. AquaSculpt has risen alongside it by offering a product that translates that metabolic spark into real, structured support.

Together, they form one of the most accessible and low-friction wellness routines of 2025 – combining hydration, gentle thermogenesis, and non-stimulant metabolic activation into a consistent morning framework.

If you’re looking for a realistic, maintainable approach to long-term weight support – without caffeine crashes, synthetic fillers, or unsustainable extremes – AquaSculpt is structured to meet that need.",1,1753797979.0,YouTuber,0,1.0,False

* **Promotes Daily Habit Anchoring**: Adding the Ice Water Hack creates a behavioral trigger – a simple habit that reminds users to take their supplement consistently, which is key for AquaSculpt’s long-term effects.
* **Clean-Label Compatibility**: Just like AquaSculpt avoids harsh stimulants, the Ice Water Hack is natural, safe, and sustainable. Together, they represent a new wave of non-invasive weight management: low-friction habits, high-impact synergy.

**The Ice Water Hack: Science, Anecdotes, and Strategic Use**

Scientific discussions around the Ice Water Hack remain active in 2025, with nutritionists, metabolic researchers, and performance coaches highlighting its thermogenic and behavioral benefits.

**Recent wellness publications report:**

* Up to a 30% spike in resting metabolic rate observed in small trials after cold fluid consumption in the morning
* Improvements in daily hydration habits, which correlate with more stable blood sugar and appetite control
* Increased adherence to supplement routines, thanks to the structured cue that the Ice Water Hack provides

A recent feature, “Ice Water Hack Ingredients Under Review”, explores the cold water trend in depth and explains how supplements like AquaSculpt are specifically structured to enhance its metabolic effects.

Influencers and affiliate reviewers frequently pair their Ice Water Hack tutorials with transparent supplement stacks – and AquaSculpt has emerged as a consistent favorite. Unlike caffeine-loaded fat burners, AquaSculpt doesn’t create conflict with cold water intake or early-morning use.

In fact, TikTok users have begun coining the phrase: **“Ice + Aqua = Sculpt.”**

This catchphrase reflects a growing pairing strategy: using the Ice Water Hack to kickstart the day, and AquaSculpt to support metabolic alignment throughout it.

**How to Pair the Ice Water Hack With AquaSculpt**

**Morning Routine (0-15 Minutes After Waking):**

* Drink 10 ounces of ice-cold water – optional squeeze of lemon for taste and electrolyte balance
* Take 1 capsule of AquaSculpt with the water – no food required
* Light movement or stretch (optional) – to enhance circulation and metabolic “wake-up”
* Wait 20-30 minutes before breakfast or coffee – allowing AquaSculpt and the hydration signal to initiate energy flow naturally

This simple 4-step sequence is now seen across YouTube morning routine videos, TikTok reels, and affiliate wellness blogs – often cited as a no-crash, no-burn, long-game solution.

**From Trend to Strategy: Why AquaSculpt Is the Engine**

While trends come and go, metabolic sustainability requires a longer vision. The Ice Water Hack is the entry point, the low-friction gateway into healthier routines. But it’s AquaSculpt that delivers the structural, ingredient-level support that consumers need to see real, sustainable progress.

Both are powerful on their own. But together, they represent a modern metabolic pairing that aligns with 2025’s shift toward daily, data-backed wellness systems.

No crashes. No stimulants. No hype-heavy burnout.

Just daily clarity, hydration, and balance – all anchored by AquaSculpt’s proven support model.

A recent article titled “Aqua Sculpt Complaints Investigated” evaluated user concerns and re-validated the product’s role as a long-term metabolic ally. It also highlighted how structured morning routines such as the Ice Water Hack play a key role in repeat usage success.

A follow-up review titled “Aqua Sculpt Reviewed: Explore the Shocking Science Behind AquaSculpt” offers a deep dive into AquaSculpt’s unique approach to metabolism support. It explains the logic behind AquaSculpt’s clean-label formulation, non-stimulant ingredient stack, and how its gradual, habit-based design compares favorably to older-generation fat burners. This article further reinforces AquaSculpt’s rising status in the clean wellness space and complements the Ice Water Hack perfectly by showcasing why structured routines are outperforming short-term solutions.

**Frequently Asked Questions: Ice Water Hack + AquaSculpt Integration**

**Is the Ice Water Hack effective without AquaSculpt?**  
Yes. The Ice Water Hack offers modest thermogenic and hydration benefits on its own. However, many users report improved metabolic consistency and better appetite control when pairing the practice with AquaSculpt’s structured, non-stimulant formulation.

**What temperature should the water be for maximum effect?**  
Ideally, the water should be between 35°F and 50°F – cold enough to activate the body’s internal heating response without causing discomfort. Ice-filled water is most commonly used to achieve this range.

**Should AquaSculpt be taken on an empty stomach?**  
Most users tolerate AquaSculpt well in a fasted state and take it immediately after waking with cold water. Those with sensitive digestion may prefer to follow up with a light breakfast or smoothie.

**Can AquaSculpt be used twice daily?**  
Yes. The standard dosage allows for one to two capsules per day. Many users split this across morning and early afternoon. Always follow the label instructions and consult a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations.

**Can AquaSculpt be taken with coffee?**  
Yes. Because AquaSculpt is stimulant-free, it can be safely paired with coffee. Some users wait 30 to 60 minutes after their morning dose to consume caffeine in order to assess tolerance and routine impact.

**Is AquaSculpt intended for short-term or long-term use?**  
AquaSculpt is designed for long-term metabolic support. Reviewers often report best outcomes over 90 days or more. It is not a crash-solution or rapid-fat-loss product, but rather a structured metabolism tool intended for sustained use.

**Is this combination appropriate for older adults or those with health sensitivities?**  
Many older adults favor AquaSculpt for its gentleness and lack of harsh stimulants. The Ice Water Hack is also generally well-tolerated, though those with underlying conditions should consult a healthcare professional before adopting any new health routine.

**Bonus Integration Tips: Maximizing AquaSculpt’s Effectiveness**

Thousands of AquaSculpt users and affiliate reviewers have contributed tips to help streamline the integration of AquaSculpt and the Ice Water Hack into daily routines. Below are some of the most effective:

* Prepare your capsule and full glass of ice water the night before and place it bedside for automatic compliance.
* Consider adding lemon or a small pinch of sea salt to your cold water to support electrolyte balance and early digestion.
* Track your intake using a habit app or physical journal for improved consistency over 30-, 60-, or 90-day cycles.
* Pair the routine with early light movement (e.g., walking, stretching) to compound metabolic engagement.
* Keep an AquaSculpt capsule in your work bag for consistent second-dose timing when needed.

These micro-optimizations reflect the broader 2025 trend toward habit-based systems that emphasize behavior, not just biology.

**Pros and Cons of the AquaSculpt + Ice Water Hack Routine**

**Pros**

* Simple and structured routine that supports consistency
* Compatible with fasted use, daily schedules, and morning rituals
* Free from stimulants, synthetic additives, or habit-forming ingredients
* Can be safely stacked with common supplements such as probiotics, collagen, and omega-3s
* Supported by affiliate reviewers, long-term users, and platform comparisons
* Aligned with current behavioral and metabolic science research
* Appeals to both first-time supplement users and experienced wellness consumers

**Cons**

* Requires ongoing use and consistency for best results
* Not intended for rapid weight loss or crash dieting
* May be less effective without some degree of dietary and lifestyle support
* Individuals with sensitivity to cold exposure may need to adjust the Ice Water Hack parameters

This routine reflects a maturing weight support market: one that favors sustainable, compoundable tools over short-lived trends or intensity-based cycles.

**Final Summary and Call to Action**

The Ice Water Hack has surged in popularity because of its simplicity, safety, and alignment with the body’s natural energy systems. AquaSculpt has risen alongside it by offering a product that translates that metabolic spark into real, structured support.

Together, they form one of the most accessible and low-friction wellness routines of 2025 – combining hydration, gentle thermogenesis, and non-stimulant metabolic activation into a consistent morning framework.

1mccc55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1mccc55/help_i_feel_like_im_on_autopilot_not_really/,"HELP: I feel like I’m on autopilot, not really present, and caffeine oddly helped(?)","Hello, I wanted to ask about a strange experience I’ve been dealing with for a while, and I’m not sure if it’s something I should be concerned about or bring up during my next psych visit.

I’ve been noticing that I often feel like I’m not fully present in my body, like I’m moving and doing things physically, but mentally I’m somewhere else. I’m usually focused on random thoughts or internal monologue I come up in my head and the thoughts that are in my head are COMPLETELY UNRELATED to what i am actually doing. It feels like I’m running on autopilot, and even basic tasks start feeling difficult or confusing. I also tend to space out in a way that doesn’t feel normal to me. The odd part is that I can barely remember anything during these moments, and if I do remember something, it often feels distant or disconnected, almost like I’m recalling someone else’s memory(?) 

This has been going on for quite some time. I honestly can’t say for sure if it started before or after I began taking psychiatric meds because my memory is a bit hazy around that period, so I can’t pinpoint exactly when it began, only an approximate.

At one point, I started doing risky things just to try and feel more aware or be ‘in the moment’. For example, one time I slid down a steep hill at a park, flew off the seat, and got injured. While it was happening, I didn’t feel fully there. Strangely though, my reflexes reacted well and protected my body from further injuries. After watching my friend’s video on the event that I could piece together what happened, since I haven't really mentally registered most of it at that time. I do remember some parts of it but it feels like it’s not my own memory at all.

Later that day, I drank dalgona coffee (I usually try to avoid caffeine as much as possible as per my psychiatrist's orders, since I have bipolar disorder, but I missed the taste so I tried buying one). Weirdly enough, it kinda helped? After drinking it, I felt more focused, more grounded, and more aware of what was going on around me, like I wasn’t as lost in my head, and I was able to function better overall.

I was also surprised how I interacted with others kinda improved. I was more sociable (though hypomania can play a factor in it). The thing is that during this event, I wasnt irritable at all, but rather the opposite. Bear in mind that I do talk fast because of my hypomania. When stressful situations occur, such as my niece and nephew doing kid stuff, I surprisingly became calmer.

Something to keep in mind though is that, this time I may have had a positive effect on controlled caffeine intake. It doesn't mean that it has positive effects on me EVERY time I drink one. Maybe the amount of caffeine could be a factor? 

During the times I was having a negative effect with caffeine (mania, irritability, intense mood swings, muffled auditory hallucinations, etc.), I was pretty much consuming high amounts of caffeine, like drinking Monster Energy and sometimes even misusing it and drinking more than the recommended amount. Though this time, the amount of caffeine I consumed was way lesser than I usually do. 

I’m going on tangents here and theorizing things. Maybe because it's a stimulant? Maybe ADHD could be a factor or a possibility? It could be depersonalization-derealization, though once again, I am not going to self diagnose. What made me arrive at this thought is because I do show some signs of ADHD lately. What made me think about this, is because people who are diagnosed with ADHD are prescribed with medications that are classified as stimulants. I found it similar to coffee, which is a stimulant too. I am not assuming NOR self-diagnosing, just a heads up. I’m just thinking aloud here. 

Without further ado, here are some important details about me:

- I’m diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

- I take Divalproex Sodium 500mg (twice a day), Risperidone 2mg, and Sertraline 75mg.

- I have a history of substance use, including misusing my psychiatric meds (especially sertraline), overdosing on OTC meds, and drinking excessive amounts of caffeine through energy drinks. I also drink alcohol occasionally, though not often. HOWEVER, I want to clarify that these symptoms (the “autopilot” feeling and memory issues) started before the substance use and MAY have began after I was started on psychiatric medication. Though, the symptoms may have exacerbated due to the substance use.

DISCLAIMER: I am NOT trying to make any assumptions about what this is though, and I’m DEFINITELY NOT saying caffeine is a solution! Especially I know it can trigger mania or interact with my medication. Its just, I just found it really weird that a small amount helped me feel more functional and aware especially without pushing me into a full blown manic episode like energy drinks have in the past.

My main questions are:

- Could this “autopilot” or foggy feeling be a side effect of my medication or related to one of my diagnoses?

- Is it possible that maybe caffeine (being a stimulant and all), SOMEHOW helped temporarily with focus or presence?? if so, since considering how caffeine isn't recommended for my case, what should I expect to be prescribed for me in place of caffeine? What factor played in here that made the tiny bit of caffeine work, and what should be the course of action for what caused it? I'd like an explanation please.

- Should I bring this up seriously with my psychiatrist, or does it sound like something normal that others deal with? If so, how do I word this out for my psychiatrist, since the hospital I’m currently having check ups in assigns psychiatrists randomly and some of them CAN be condescending which makes me anxious on their response.

Thanks in advance for any input. I know this was a long post, but I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and share their thoughts ^o^

She complained before that she didn’t like it when people were round when the place wasn’t tidy, which I understand and agree with. If we are planning to have people over I like to have the place looking nice.

My cousin and I met up this morning in the city  and we came back to my place for a coffee afterwards while he waited for his train.

My girlfriend was at work at this point and wasn’t expected to be in. When I left to take my cousin to the station she passed us on the way back in after getting home from work early.

When I got back from the station she was pissed off at me and said something along the lines of “why did you bring him back when this place is a mess?”.

I understand her position, however, it’s not like we were having guests round for a meal. My cousin and I hadn’t originally planned to come and hang out here or I would have tidied it beforehand. It was just the most convenient (and polite) option at the time.

The feeling I have is that this is my place as much as hers and I should be able to invite people round on an impromptu basis when it suits, I’m not a child and shouldn’t have to ask for permission.

Her position is that it should have been tidy beforehand in the event that we came back here, however, this can’t always be planned for. Alternatively, she thinks I should just have not brought him back here since when the situation arose it was already too late and the place was still messy.

Fair enough if the place is a complete riot, but it wasn’t that bad. It is a never ending battle keeping this place together too because we don’t have a dishwasher, so it’s not always going to be completely perfect.

However, I do appreciate that she has expressed an issue with this in the past. I understand her gripe, but sometimes that’s just the way it is. Situations arise spontaneously sometimes like this.

Had I said to my cousin “we can’t go back to mine right now because the place is kinda messy” he would have probably laughed as it is not an issue for him at all. I wasn’t going to just make up an excuse to avoid going there either, it was the most straightforward option.

Perhaps I am wrong here. I do see my girlfriend’s perspective, but once the situation arises where the flat isn’t tidy and it’s easiest to invite somebody back, what does she expect me to do?

Aside from always having the place in tip top condition, should I have just made up an excuse? Even if she wasn’t in?

I’m obviously open to the idea of being in the wrong here, I just don’t really think it is anywhere near as big of a deal as she is making it out to be.

AITA here?

It’s been a bit too quiet on my end lately. Work drains me, social media feels hollow, and voice notes from friends aren’t hitting like they used to. I miss having someone to talk to about absolutely anything. Like why the sky looked weird today or why my coffee suddenly tasted like betrayal. I’m not rushing into anything romantic, just hoping to meet someone who’s emotionally present and likes showing up. If something deeper comes along, I’m open to it.

**About me:**

* 5'1""
* Likes warm, unfiltered convos and laughing until I forget what I was talking about
* Voice note sender. Will probably say “wait lang, ang random nito” a lot
* Ganda daw sabi ng tindera sa palengke and my very honest friends

**About you:**

* 23 to 30
* Can talk about both serious things and really dumb things
* May gentle voice or gentle energy
* Comfortable with **discord calls**, maybe even sleep calls if we click
* Laughs with effort. Preferably the HAHAHA kind, not “hehe” na may lungkot
* Curious, open-minded, and actually wants to build a connection

**Bonus points:**

* You’re not just bored. You’re here because you want to know someone fully
* Okay ka lang both sa 2AM convos and 5-minute silences
* May sense of humor or at least a sense of timing

My second client I stayed 2 weeks….family was difficult, space was uncomfortable, and the client was high maintenance, not for me. But my current client? 
He lives alone, is fully cognizant, can tell me exactly what he wants/needs, has a catheter and is continent enough to have a BM in the toilet.

I get that some people may liked some ambiguous things about this finale and that they did something different, but it's not my cup of coffee. It wasn't all bad, but I really wanted to see something more clear, who I type as the killer in the end? I truly don't know, both Paige and Andy had things that would make them a killer but also things that don't make a lot of sense. I was leaning more about Paige definitely but in the last minutes Andy kinda gave me a big killer vibe, especially in the end with his smile and kinda mocking Paige """"It's over isn't it? Final Girl..."", though her ""See you in hell"", also had like something in it BUT if Andy WAS the killer then he was the biggest killer idiot I ever saw. I dunno, honestly, I wouldn't be even surprised if both of them killed some people in the the motel at the end. Overall it was just kinda boring to me and again - I just don't like ""who was the killer really"" endings in slashers like this.

I also kinda didn't care for Paige and Andy that much anyway. Though Andy was MUCH more likeable in this episode than Paige....I think my least liked Paula Brancati role, she just felt like a rehash of Christy from Flesh & Blood to me for most of the season, then in the finale just turn into spoiled diva persona.  It was nice to see Breton Lalama again (O'Keefe from Flesh & Blood) in a little role and Katie McGrath was a total shock, I didn't expect to see her agaim in Slasher, so that was surprise cameo, hilarious thing, her couple seconds cameo gave me more interesting character vibe, han her lead character in Executioner which was for me terribly bland and annoying.

My favorite finals are still Solstice and Guilty Party ones, they just had what I'm looking for the most in a slasher finale, also my 3 favorite seasons are still Guilty Party, Solstice and Ripper.

How I rank this one? I dunno.....there are things I really liked about it, but also things I really DIDN'T liked about it. I think I DEFINITELY PUT IT above Executioner because this season was just personally very boring to me for most of the time with very bland and annoying two leads characters (Sarah and Dylan) and overall it didn't have characters I liked that much, Robin was the best there and the only one I REALLY LIKED, here there was few characters I liked, I loved Ruby and wanted to see more of her, Hemmingway was fun, Crow was very interesting character, even though most of them were killed VERY FAST. There still was Adrianna and Blake.....and finale WASN'T the worst, in my opinion Flesh & Blood had still the worst finale with just painfully stupid and weird out of nowhere behaviour for all characters left, which went just totally feral and had total characters assasination for all (yeah) ALL three left charactershers, here, for most part it had sense, it was just boring for me and that different thing. BUT then again I liked Flesh & Blood overall more if we not counting two last episodes........I think I put it above The Executioner but below all the rest, sorry, I guess this season just wasn't my thing that much, I still give it 6/10 :V

As for finale itself, I put it above Flesh & Blood for sure and above The Executioner one. Like i said it wasn't TERRIBLE for me, there was things in it I liked just.....kinda boring and underwhelming.",2,1753797515.0,SlasherTVSeries,0,0.75,False

Like, not just the ""get a job"" thing (because duh, that's what most people say), but legit, mind-blowing ways to see your bank balance stop making you want to cry every time you look at it? I feel like I'm either missing a big secret, or everything online is a straight-up scam.

Is there really ONE path? NO WAY. But why does it seem like everyone else figured out some cheat code I don't have? Seriously, you look around, and it feels like:

- People investing in crypto like they're psychic
- Someone selling their drawings on the internet for actual dollars
- Folks getting rich livestreaming themselves EATING NOODLES?!

Explain yourself, world.

Have you ever had that moment when your brain gets stuck on “How do I start if I literally have NOTHING?” Because SAME. I’ve spent so much time scrolling through https://goodnovel.org/ hoping for a rags-to-riches story so inspiring, my brain would just absorb it and—VOILA, success.

Here’s what truly confuses me though:

- Why do some people get obsessed with the slow path (save all your pennies, cut every coffee)?
- Why do some panic-splurge on side hustles that cost $299 up front?
- Is it really possible just to turn a weird skill into cash online??
- Are we all secretly hoping to stumble across some golden ticket instead?

Sometimes I think about passive income, and my mind wanders to luxurious vacations and people in poolside chairs, their phones pinging with new cash. But HOW??

- Stocks? They look complicated AND scary.
- Dropshipping? I hear horror stories!
- Writing? Actually, there are people getting paid to share stories (I root through https://goodnovel.org/ like it's a map to the fountain of youth, tbh).

And then there’s that advice: “Follow your passion, and the money will follow!” Except… like, are you supposed to invest YEARS before you see a penny? Or is there a shortcut? If you know it—I’m BEGGING you, spill.

So friends, r/LuxuryGiftsf squad:

- What’s actually WORKED for you? Not theory, but in real messy life?
- Have you ever stumbled into something weird and it just…made money?
- Should I give up and just become an influencer? (I eat snacks, does that count?)

I crave ideas that don’t require ten degrees, $50k startup funds, or becoming a crypto bro. Something that someone out there, sitting in their pajamas, figured out—and can share.

Talk to me. I know the internet is where people go from “broke” to “making it” every day. Even if it's just writing spicy stories (seriously, some bizarre plot twists on https://goodnovel.org/ kept me up all night—maybe that’s MY ticket?), tell me what’s possible!

Recently, my visit to the local supermarket transgormed into an unexpected diagnostic event as I stood, I kid you not, paralyzed in front of the dental care aisle. 

Observable somatic markers included heightened muscular tension locaetd prominently in the corrugator supercilii and frontalis muscles, aligning perfectly with the onset of intense head scratching. Estimated heart rate variability revealed subtle fluctuations indiative of underlying sterss responses, perhaps mirroring a low-grade fight-or-flight response atypical to retail environments. Simultaneously, a curious tingling sensation—paresthesia, if you will—manifested along my forearms, potentially symptomatic of subconscious societal pressures associated with tooth enamel preseevation.

The substantial variety of oltions presented an overwhelming cognitive load, prompting strategic ocular fixation on the shelves, as if my ocular muscles themselves were attempting to decipher the product hierarchy though their own rigorous investigation. Each toothpaste brand, ostensibly identical in core function, demanded illogically meticulous scrutiny, extending to factors such as fluoride concentration, packaging color (as if that matters?!), and hormone-mimetic effects of microgranule sbcomponents—conceptuwlly fanciful, yet intrinsiically tied to my purchasing paralysis.

In retrospect, the empirical method failed to yield a decisive outcome, culminating in the default selection of a familiar, if uninspiring, generic brand. Alas, the physiological afterath, characterized by an embarrassing residal mental haze, serves as a clinical reminder: even the choice of toothpaste can instigate a full-blown analyss paralysis episode—an outcome measurable not only by the inconsequential item in my shopping basket but also by the absurdity of my ensuing reflection.

As people are observing - LLMs are not distinct search engines with their own criteria - they are using Query Fan Out in search engines means that LLM visibility is down to backlinks.

So apart from buying backlinks and because Social Media doesn't help directly and BYO don't have any carriage - what can people do?

# Idea 1: Collect Data for PR

PR Driven - collect data, run surveys and learn how to summarize data for interesting use for your PR teams. I'm sure your PR partners can give input on what their news partners find interesting.

Q: Have you thought of doing this? Any PR experts have some stories to tell or questions to share?

PR is more that Press Release Wires - its about getting featured in articles too

# Idea 2: Joint Go-To Market

Joint Go-To-Market - create blog articles about joint offerings - use that to expand topical authority. The key here is to avoid linking on your branded terms - give Google useful context. Dont link to 'Our partners, Brian's Plumbing"": - link to ""our Rhode Island Domestic Plumbing services partner"". But you have to help both pages get traffic. The best thing about outbound linking: you can transform numerical authority into ANY topical authority - the remote topic does not have to be relevant to your whole site - this a is a common but completely unbased myth.

Q: Who else has done this, what have been your experiences and what can be done to level up? What other scenarios can you build out:?\]

Q; This can work outside of local? What about technology integrations in SaaS products?

# Idea 3: Trading SEO Services

As a digital marketing vendor/SEO expert or provider - can you lend your digital skills to your clients partners?

I did this at Kemp - and I did it in two ways

1. We help our resale partners SEO - their sales = our sales. So how deo we help craft content, rank it, link to it.

The great thing is you can use your limited available le of backlinks to help another domain, and then ask for backlinks in return for your time - thus getting new sources of authority back to you client

Q: Can you do this via affiliates? In B2C or B2B?

2. Our Inbound team also managed our influencers - and something I still do as a boutique, specialist SEO agency. We help SaaS influencers grow their traffic on behalf of our clients

# Idea 4: The SEO Vendor Link Broker

Create links between other projects in your purview

# Idea 5: Host an OpenCoffee-style Meetup (Virtual/IRL)

1mcc0ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mcc0ph/husbands_mental_health_issues_are_increasingly/,Husband's mental health issues are increasingly intense...how do I know when it's time to call it?,"I'm 31F, he's 33M, been married under a year.

He's been up front about his mental health issues since we met (depression, suicidal thoughts, social anxiety, perfectionism that can push to obsessiveness). Otherwise he does *okay*, and can be hilarious and outgoing and very sweet. 

Typically, once every couple months, he goes into a mood that lasts for 3-5 days where he'll barely talk, won't make eye contact, and won't want to be touched. Usually during those times he gets extra perfectionist and needs his environment to be the way he wants it. He comes out of it when he decides he's ready to talk, and sometimes use the talk to bring up issues with the relationship - hard on me, but we make it work. I try to accommodate his perfectionism and admit I can be sloppy or messy sometimes, but I think well within a normal range. 

Since we got married, though, his requests and triggers have gotten increasingly irrational, and he's been mean in conflict in a way I hadn't seen yet. His moods have come on suddenly and feel less predictable. I've been off work for the last month (I'm a teacher) and been trying to take on most of the domestic chores since I'm off. He has a few chores he insists on doing because I won't do them to his ""standard"" (mowing the lawn, watering the plants), but I've been doing the majority of cooking/laundry/groceries/dog walks/errands. Still, he'll say things like ""you do nothing around here, you just go off gallivanting with your friends all day,"" and berates or yells at me for things like leaving a window open, forgetting to check on the garden, or making coffee ""wrong.""

 In the last few days, things have gone downhill fast, and he's not really speaking to me because he's so angry at me. Says he's ""feeling done"" with the relationship and can't take it any more. (Nothing I've done recently has been out of the ordinary.)

A few complicating factors:
-hes been a multiple-times-a-day weed smoker for his whole adulthood, and quit 3 weeks ago. He's barely been sleeping and is miserable. I want to give him time to withdraw from it and recalibrate
-hes been trying to take his mental health more seriously, including going to therapy semi-regularly, but has to pay out of pocket so it's prohibitive. He's anti-medication 
-he has a cycle of working a job for a couple years, then transitioning to another one once he gets frustrated. He currently hates his job
-i started moving yesterday into the downstairs part of our house, with a partial basement suite, because I was feeling really stressed to be near him 
-my family loves him and he's able to totally mask his issues in front of family and friends 

What do I do? My plan right now is to wait him out for a week or so? We have a vacation to see his family booked next week, but I more or less refuse to go if he's going to be nice to my face for them but treat me like this behind their backs. They don't know about his issues.

I love him and want to be supportive as he's clearly in a lot of pain. Booked an appt with my therapist in two weeks as well. 

We do own a house together but I'm in a good position financially to leave if it came to that. No kids- though we both want them. Are things just going to keep getting worse?

A couple miles down the road, away from room 309, and away from the Harmony Hillside Hotel, Leila called out of work. Her daughter had just knocked on the door, surprising her with a visit for the first time in eight months. She squealed upon opening the door to her daughter’s exhausted face with the backdrop of a red morning sky. The woman was now nearly a foot taller than Leila, but she still squeezed her as if she were a child. Half out of instinct she tried to pick her up. She was well muscled into her sixties from the lifetime of labor, but that was not enough to lift her girl. 

Margaret Campbell, firstborn and only child of Leila Campbell, was raised with the notion to be better than her mom. Leila wanted her daughter to go to college, and get through it, unlike herself. She never wanted to see her daughter, who had her own eyes and her missing father’s blonde hair color, to go on to a life whose majority was spent mopping floors and folding sheets.

Maggie had a falling out with her mother when she was seventeen. When it was time to start filling out college applications; young Maggie didn't want to. Leila freaked and screamed and screamed. College was the *way out,* the only way out as far as she was concerned. But Maggie had insisted on going to a police academy.

The fallout of the argument lasted a couple months. Maggie was off at the academy, just as a recruit, still learning the very basics, when Leila came to terms with her daughter's decision. Leila trusted her daughter's judgment, hell she raised her to have a mind the same as her own after all, and sure enough Maggie graduated at the top of her class. As she hugged her grown daughter when she came off the stage, it reminded her of a college graduation she never got to go to herself, and all was forgiven.

Three years of outstanding police work later, to Leila’s surprise her daughter decided to go to a university, and at twenty-six years old, Maggie graduated with a double major in criminal justice and psychology. By twenty-seven Officer Margaret Campbell became Detective Margaret Campbell, and within the year, her little girl was off across the country, working long days and nights. Leila couldn’t be more proud, and as she sat next to her daughter now, hand squeezing hand, letting the front desk know she’ll be coming in tomorrow instead, tears started to well in her eyes as she thought about how far her little girl has come. 

Leila ended the call not knowing what the response was, it wasn't often she called out or late. She stuttered as she offered her daughter coffee, ashamed of her own forgetfulness and lack of manners. “Please, please let me get a pot of coffee running! You must be tired! Did you drive all the way here or fly?” Leila began to stand and scramble for the coffee pot.

“I’m fine mom. I drove. I think I have enough caffeine in me to wake the dead, please no more coffee.” It was true, she had picked up four dollars’ worth of gas station black coffee on her fifteen hour drive down. 

“DROVE? Oh my goodness! You didn’t even tell me. You HAVE to tell me! When did you start driving?”

“Mom. Mom, it's all good. The drive was smooth. I was just… missing being home.”

“Oh baby, you're welcome anytime.”

The two women sat with the rising sun painting portraits in orange and yellow through the window. Leila’s eyes were locked onto her daughter's face, wrinkles amplifying her own weathered, smiling face. Her thumb caressing the back of Maggie’s hand. Maggie looked past her mother, off into the corner of the kitchen in which they sat. Leila began to notice the tiny fault lines of wrinkles gathering in her daughter's cheeks and her delicate forehead. She noticed silver had begun to sprout out around the temples of her daughter's once blonde hair, which was now a calm wheat brown. Perhaps her daughter too, was growing old. What a wild thought. Her little Maggie would never. I mean it was just a couple years ago she had been conceived. Just a couple years ago she held her tiny sleepy, pink body onto her chest in the hospital room. Just a couple years ago she was dressing her up in delicate cotton skirts and tying her thin blonde hair into pigtails- which in reality turned out more like tufts of unruly hay. 

“I’ll fix myself a glass of water.” Maggie said, breaking the silence and their hand contact. 

“I've got to ask, what's the occasion? Not-Not to sound ungrateful.” 

Maggie turned on the sink spout and the glass was filled, reflecting the kitchen scene upside down within it. “Work gets to be too much sometimes.” She said, “There's a lot that I do that makes me not take anything for granted.” She took a long drink of water then looked to her mother, who looked back at her with large worrying eyes. “Or, you know, sometimes I just want to see you.” 

“You're always welcome to.” There was once again a silence as Maggie finished off her glass of water, then Leila spoke again. “What have they got you working on sherlock?” She saw a slight twitch in her daughter's jaw to which she quickly continued “If-If you want- or ok with to talk about it.”

“No, no, it's fine.” Maggie sat back down at the table with a fresh glass of water. “Well…” She tried to begin but paused in thought. Her almond thumbnails scraped at each other on the back of the transparent glass. “So last year… there was this string of crimes, dumb little things like folks walking out of hardware stores with expensive tools, lawnmowers, things of the sort. It ended up being cross country. Twenty two different states they were stealing from, so they put me on it, and it was real low stakes. I mean, the guys, five of them there were, just piled as much as they could onto those carts, and just walked out the doors, no threats, no masks, none of that, clean and simple.

When we did track them down, they ended up having two and a half million. Yeah, *million* in tools and batteries, and that was just what they had on them, not even what was sold.

So, I guess a lot of the times they pulled off their little maneuver the cops weren’t even called because we hadn’t been tracking the sheer amount they had. But anyway, this is all public record now, I think, I don’t think I’m saying anything out of hand.” She looked up at her mother’s weary eyes, then back at her glass with a faux soulless smile. “But anyway, that's gotta be one of my favorite cases, not worth a damn to tell at a bar or share to my kids if I one day have them that is. But yup, I gotta say it's my favorite.”

She looked up again to see her mother nodding, her eyebrows showed concern that her smile failed to mask. Maggie noted to herself that her mother did not yet understand. “It’s my favorite because it's lighthearted, you know. Funny almost. I mean I could picture myself watching a comedy flick or comic on a bunch of doofuses making it big by just minding your business and walking out the door of a Bolt-and-Build Emporium. If my job wasn't my job, I'd be laughing with them as they walked out, fifty drills in a shopping cart. Two and a half million.” The last sentence Maggie said, with a whistle, in awe of the amount. Then with a shaky breath she began again.

“But they’re not all like that. They sure aren't.” She said shaking her head, her peppery ponytail waving left to right stiffly. “I mean, I’ve had serious cases. A ton of ‘em. Shootouts here, drug money there, corrupt officers, stalkers, smuggling, murders, accidental killings, mass shootings. All types of the sort. I mean I’ve got used to some things. I haven't flinched at the sight of blood in a couple years, I can hear someone's kid got turned into a skid mark by a truck and it’ll put a pause on my good mood, but I’ll keep it pushing and I won't lose any sleep that night. Horrible things I'm saying, I know.” Maggie said without looking up, another shaky long breath rattled her words.

“Not all things go down easy though. I don't think any human’s supposed to see some things I have. Hell, I-. Hell, I once saw a woman drowning her newborn in a toilet, had to shoot her twice to stop her. Inhuman strength a person has when they’re out of their mind.”

Maggie felt her eyes burning, she hadn't blinked them in a while as she stared at the rising sun through her glass.

“My buddy kicked in the door; the baby was still alive when he did. The poor thing wasn't when I got her own mother off of her. She thought the baby was the devil himself.

Postpartum depression paired with a brutal case of schizophrenia. I was joking, or more like- more like talking with one of my catholic friends a couple weeks after the case, and she brought up the faith. She wondered a couple hundred years back-. She wondered a couple hundred years back if the townsfolk would’ve believed the mom. Would that baby be up for an exorcism?” A dry laugh, a single chuckle escaped from deep within Maggie’s throat.

“Well, I’d think the mother, if anyone, would have the devil in her.” Maggie raised the glass to drink but set it back down before ever setting it to her lips. “There's one I think I told you about, or at least I think I did. You remember that one night, I called you on the phone crying- I had been drinking, I didn’t even say who it was when you picked up?”

Leila nodded, not saying a word, and Maggie continued. “I don't even know if I got out the story of that one.” Maggie turned the water glass in her hand, admiring its movement like it were a glass of expensive bourbon. “God, it was sick. You know I haven't seen a movie since- All the footage I had to look through. Oh, this is all so heavy for the morning, I’m so sorry for bringing this up so suddenly.” 

Her mother shot a hand out onto Maggie’s arm, which was coated in a thin layer of sweat. “No, please continue love, It’s okay. I think it was something pornographic or of the sort?”

“No. No, I wish it only was.” The water in the glass formed tiny waves with the quivering of Maggie’s hand. “It was a factory. Out in Virginia. Ran like a proper manufacturing plant, they sold jerky. Yeah, all the tax records lined up, purchases of preservatives, salt, dehydrating apparatuses, it all lined up, they had workers on payroll, health insurance, dentistry, and their profits all lined up, not a damn thing was wrong from the outside. Yup. But we had collected a couple tapes, brought to us by horrified teens, some mothers, some divorced old drunk, from various video-tape stores.

We asked, at every single one of those stores, where they got the tapes, and all of them said they bought them used, the same as any other tape. And no, they didn't watch them, just threw a dollar tag on it and put it in a random bin. Bunch of snuff films they were.”

Maggie shook her head, her eyes a million miles away. “And that's nothing new, we get a dozen of those a week probably. But what raised red flags was they were all in the same room, but they weren't all the same person. Normally I’d think they were filmed in another country and we’d toss them. Maybe even break them so they're not dug out the trash. But they couldn't have been, the people in the videos-. The people in those videos were always begging for their lives in English. They weren’t even drugged so there was no denying it. And if you looked close enough you’d see all-American brand beer and soda just laying around the background.” Maggie took a large exhale.

“After we gathered about sixteen of those videos, my buddy Martinez noticed a pattern, in where the victims were presumably from. They were all from Mississippi, except for two who disappeared right on the corner of that jerky plant. We sent some folks looking through the plant, under the premise that they were checking out working conditions, and sure enough, they found those same splayed-out beer bottles and cans, in the same position they were in those films. It was good enough for me and the judge, so we went on busting through there two days later.”

Maggie bit her bottom lip and wet it with her tongue, then continued, her voice almost hoarse. “Sure, enough we found so much trace blood in that room- which they tried to say was cow blood, and a couple others, we found the filming equipment, the weapons, all of it. We didn't know how many victims they had. We didn't know which workers were in on it. That night I called you- That night I called you I had led myself to believe the whole damn factory was in on it, that maybe that jerky they produced didn't even have beef in it. A hell of a story that would be. The seventh biggest Jerky business in the states was selling dried human meat and made money on the side selling tapes of their production process under the table. No such thing was the case though.

It was just four guys, who didn't think the factory pay was cutting it for them. But it still keeps me up at night. Just *what if.*” Maggie went to drink from her glass and found it empty, she had drank it all already. 

Leila, trying to find some motherly wisdom, could only manage. “That's awful honey.” 

A short exhale of a laugh pushed itself through Maggie's lips.

“But I don't get a break, not in a way that matters. I figure that's enough thought of evil and wickedness for a lifetime. And I know it's no meat factory but recently-. But recently, I slept with a man. I know it's awkward telling my mom this, but I’ve got to tell someone. I slept with a man. He-. He-” Large exhale “So, right after that snuff film case wrapped up, I was put onto a small case. It was in a small town in South Carolina.

A college girl, was found raped and murdered, tossed like trash on the side of the road. Her body looked like a mannequin, sitting there in a gutter. It was three whole days before anyone called it in, it was swollen and half-eaten by then. Poor girl.” She raised the glass to her lips again, for only a drop to slither down. “Rape, it’s a horrid thing. It’s unreal. How can someone kill someone they just fucked? I suppose they fuck them first then realize the victims going to run off and tell. Then they don’t have much of a choice. It’s animalistic. Well-” Maggie blinked her staring, bulging eyes. “Well, believe it or not, it's not all that animalistic. In fact, it's as human as it gets. Did you know very few species of animal commit rape the way humans do? There of course isn't a whole lot of consent in the animal kingdom, but it’s carried out differently, you know. The males have to earn it, they put on a show or gift something, fight another male or the like. But very few animals will rape another. Like I said it’s as human as it gets. Horrible thing to tell my mother I know. Anyway, we had been on the lookout for this girl for a week by the time her body was called in.

Her boyfriend called his local department the previous Tuesday, crying that his girlfriend hadn’t been home in two days, and it was unlike her. Of course, their, and everyone else's, first thought was that she up and left him for someone with a better haircut, or richer family, but we had to take it seriously. No one had heard from her either and some eyebrows were raised. Of course, when a woman is murdered- when a woman is murdered the very first suspect is always the spouse, or boyfriend in this case, and I guess I’m an awful detective, or awful human being for not calling it there. But-. But-.”

She stopped, choking on her words, and Leila began to caress her daughter's forearm with her thumb once again. “But, he was a sweet talker, a real genuine seeming guy. To all those we asked, which was no less than fifteen folks, he loved his girlfriend. And I should’ve seen right through that when I got drunk that night. He just so happened to be in the same bar I was in. We drank and we talked, not a mention of the case, and six drinks later I was in his bed.” Maggie broke down into tears, Leila looked on helplessly. Maggie's voice continued with the same strength it always held. “It could’ve damn well been the same bed he raped that poor girl in.” Tears flowed and dripped onto the outside of the empty glass.

“Just yesterday, we found the knife he used to cut her throat. There was no doubt it was him. It was that damned bastard.” The crying twisted her face into an expression that made her look a decade older. “I can't believe myself. I have half a mind to hang it all up. I don't-”

“Oh, baby!” Leila finally embraced her daughter, and both their bodies shook as Maggie sobbed. “It's not your fault. You can't blame yourself.” Maggie tried to say something, but it was choked down by a sob. “You didn't know, baby. It’s not your fault.” 

As the sun finally rose above the window of Leila Campbell’s apartment, in which she and her suddenly thirty-year-old daughter held each other tight, the man was drooling, the exorcism prayer coming out sloppily through a bloody, swollen lip. He was bleeding from his right ribs; the blood warmed his lap. His ribcage ached, and his head pounded. The black man had long since disappeared from his blurring vision, but he had no doubt his bone-chilling, but somehow persuasive presence was still weighing down the air in the room. He had recited the prayer until the words blended together in his swirling head. The wounds simply just appeared, one at a time and all at once.

\#

He couldn’t put a finger on when or in which order they happened, but he knew the first thing that happened when the man in black disappeared was his stomach growling. It was awful hungry; he was awful hungry. It roared as it begged for food, the grumbling coming from both deep within his stomach and from deep in the black throat of the fireplace. But he knew he couldn’t eat. Even if the bars he made didn’t turn to ash or dirt in his mouth, it would at the least require him to untie himself, and he didn't trust himself with the whispers indistinguishable from his own thoughts. He ignored the growling; it shook his very soul.

He muttered each word, thoughtlessly not missing a single one. His eyes squinted and focused on the fireplace before him, moving left to right, then left to right again as if he were reading an unseen script. First the black man seemed to fade from his vision, then right before him as he sat in the chair the black man appeared again.

He appeared in pieces almost, first an outline, then like brushstrokes, flat against the three dimensions of the world, abstract and odd angled, then all together, oil-black skin and pinstripe gray pants riding up around his ankles. He was squatting in front of the chair, his long arms perched on both shoulders of the man. Then from beneath the pit of his right arm, appeared another, it seemed an optical illusion, odd and out of place but at the same time so seemingly normal, the man didn't even question it.

In that third dark hand was a piece of wood, a stick of light brown. As his eyes focused, through the dissipating pain of the headache, he saw the stick was carved, delicately. Then memories flooded his brain, nostalgia and its familiar comfort turned to hair-prickling fear as his mind recognized the shape, it was the wooden revolver.

The revolver he and his brother played with, one of their favorite toys. *It was just a cap gun, it was just a*\-. The man repeated to himself before switching to the prayer. With each word of the exorcism, the black man’s pristine and imposing face flinched as if he were being spit on.

“You have to remember this, don't you son? I gave you so many chances.” 

“In the name of Jesus Christ, your only begotten Son, who conquered death and triumphed over the abyss, we command the unclean spirit-” was the only response. 

“You think I need you kicking?”

“We consecrate this ground with holy water, sanctify it with our prayers, and fortify it with our faith.”

“I’ll empty you out and puppet your fucking corpse!” The black man's words had venom in them. There was no smoothness in that. Just rage, spit through clenched teeth. His visage splattered outward like clay on every emphasis of the words, just to come back together in his form of handsome blackness.

“Your celestial light pervade this space, purging it of all darkness. Command Your angelic leg-”

The pitch-black twelfth finger pulled the wooden trigger. And this time there was no toy click against his ribs. There was a loud and piercing *BLAM*. The pain didn't even register to the man for a good couple seconds.

His ears were ringing and deaf, then he felt warmth, and the pain of a bee sting in his side. A bee sting that turned into a pulsing warm numb throb, then from a throb to the feeling of having been punched, then the warm oozing of blood down his belly and into his lap. He screamed through clenched teeth; it came out almost a roar. He could see the man in black talking but the words not reaching his ears. His vision grew white and fading. His teeth felt like they were going to crack under his jaws pressure, but it was the least of his worries. *Oh god, I’m going to die. He can't really wear me when I’m dead can he? The priest never said anything about that. Oh god, I need a hospital, I need to leave.* But he pushed the thoughts out of his head and continued the prayer. The man in black grabbed him by his mess of hair, lifting his face to his own.

“You are so damned consistent.” His voice was cool, smooth and poisonous again. The third hand pulled back on the trigger twice more, the shots lined up against each other along the man's ribs. The blood pooled, *it was so warm*. The man thought he might go insane right here, of course if he was not already, or if he did not die first. This was when he began reciting again, as usual, it was all he could do.

He couldn't think if after all this he’d ever want to pray again. He’d prayed enough for a lifetime. Either that or he’d become one of those ten-time-a-day bible thumpers. 

The man in black was gone, his lip was swollen from some injury he couldn’t place. He needed to get out, he needed to escape, he could reach a hospital, try again another time when he was healed again. He rocked his chair back and forth and threw a thin line of blood from his lip across the thin beige carpeting. He rocked side to side now and stuck his toes out as far as he could. The wooden chair tripped and toppled. He fell hard onto his side, a snap that could’ve well been either his collarbone or the wooden backrest rang out across the room.

He breathed heavily but brought in very little oxygen. *Flooded*, he thought, the bullet probably flooded his lung with blood, or collapsed it altogether. He could hardly breathe, and at the worst time possible, he began to cough. He hacked but couldn't bring in enough oxygen to cough again, he just wheezed, his throat sucking in empty breaths just to choke them out again before they even reached the lungs.

Blood flew from his mouth, leaving a crown shape of crimson in front of the gasping lips. He prayed no more. The armrest had broken, and the man raised a sweaty, bloodstained arm to try to push himself to his feet but did not succeed. He instead let the sheet that tied him down fall loose and pink, no longer pristine white.

One hand clawed the ground while the other clutched the flesh around his ribs. He felt the wound squish under the slightest touch, the ribs that held its structure no longer were in one piece, if he pressed any harder, he would feel the cage collapse altogether. And the temperature, *oh god, the temperature*. The blood on the outside had grown to room temperature, almost cold, while just beneath it, it was warm, and gushing. It was still a part of him. The blood didn't even know that it was outside of his body yet. He went unconscious for a bit, or at least he thought it was a bit, before he opened his eyes and realized he was still on the floor, in this warm and bloody mess. He went in and out again and again as he drug himself inch by inch, his arm struggling to pull his body. *He had to get out*.

He let his side go, to freely bleed, so that he could dig both hands into the carpet. He pulled himself, making better ground now. He left one silent handprint and the other loud and red as he moved along the floor. He felt the rugburn across his face and saw the fireplace’s black maw take up the majority of the visible room. But all he could think was that he was going to die if he didn't leave now, *but would I even be able to make it down the stairs like this?* That was to worry about later. He grasped blindly at carpet tufts, knowing only that he was getting nearer the door. He went in and out again. He awoke once more, and reached forward with his left hand, only to reach a patch of wetness. A warm wetness. The carpet squelched. Too much had happened, and he didn't have the lifespan left to care, so the man reached again, and pulled. Then the left hand went up again, this time there was more than just a squelch, there was a *plop* as it landed in a thick puddle.

He grabbed the carpet beneath it and kept the rhythm going. When the left hand went up again there was another plop, then the right hand hit the same. Finally, when his face had begun dragging in the wetness, he raised his weak head to look what it was. There was a stream, no, a river of blood coming from underneath the door.

He needed to get out, he kept dragging, five more repetitions and he had reached the door. In horror he realized he couldn't stand up to reach the handle. *He was going to die, it was over. It was over*. But then with a soft click, the door opened on its own. The white door just swung open slowly, as if carried by a breeze and for the first time since the day he entered, the man saw the hallway of the Harmony Hillside Hotel. The yellow walls and the blue carpet were the same as he remembered them. Except as he pulled his eyes past the level of the doorway he saw the crimson, pouring river split the blue clean carpet harshly, and the hallway was longer than he remembered. Very, very long. It seemed a distance that would take at least ten minutes to walk, let alone crawl while losing more blood than he could imagine. “HELP!” he called; he had no chance of crawling that distance himself.

“Help me! Someone call an ambulance!” He heard the fireplace bellowing a great deep, bone rattling laugh, and the door slammed behind him, leaving him alone in this endless hallway. He cried for help again and again as he crawled. He felt like he was crawling for hours. Hours he didn't know he had left in him. He could finally clearly see the end of the hall through his fading vision, but there was no stairwell, there was no door, there was no exit. There was just a stone. Just a plain old, gray stone, split down the middle. A horribly familiar crack. And from the split poured the dark red river, more blood than could possibly make sense from a stone, or animal, or any sort of living or dead thing. It poured like a waterfall, like a dam that had been burst.

As the man looked at the stone through heavy eyelids, he realized, this was it, this was the end, he would be dying here. He wished this would just be some bad dream, he wished he could just wake up outside of this hotel, outside of the hotel room, just away from this all. *Oh god, please let this work* \-and the man began. *A bleeding stone. The hotel. The hotel room. The blood,* a hand sifted back and forth through the red mush*. The carpet,* his hands brushed roughly the long blue rug*. Thin black tie, what material is it? It’s polyester, cheap, it’s light, it’s cold. Thin navy lined socks, what material? Could I see them? I can't. Theres so much blood. Black faux-leather belt, can I feel it? No, I can't. Damn. Blood. My shirtsleeve, white, cotton. I can feel it. Corduroy pants, I can feel it, the ridges, rough and bumpy. Warm. I can feel them. Corduroy pants.* 

The man woke with a start. The same start he always had when he woke up from a night-terror. The room was dark, it was night again, but at least he was alone. He was safe, or at least not dying. His left hand had done itself loose and his thumb had caressed over his left thigh, providing enough of a tie to reality to wake him from that bleeding nightmare.",4,1753797100.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1mcbzgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1mcbzgi/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Worth It,"I’ve been experimenting with the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart coffee maker for a couple of weeks now, and as someone who survives on coffee, I’ve got a lot to share. The name alone promises a lot—SMART, customizable brews, fancy “BrewID” technology—and it delivers in many ways. That said, there are a few quirks worth noting if you’re eyeing this for your kitchen.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker looks sleek, which I really appreciate. The black stainless steel metal wrap gives the machine a premium, modern look that fits surprisingly well on my cluttered kitchen counter. It doesn't feel overly bulky at 8.3 inches deep, 13.4 inches wide, and 12.4 inches high, so even smaller kitchen spaces won’t feel invaded. It doesn’t scream “appliance,” which is always a plus for me. The build feels solid, neither overly heavy nor flimsy, clocking in at around 8.3 pounds. Overall, it’s sturdy without being a hassle to move around. 

**Performance and BrewID Technology**  
I was genuinely curious about this BrewID tech. The idea is that the machine recognizes your K-Cup pod, uses its mystical coffee programming skills, and brews it to what the “roaster recommends.” I tested this with various pods, from light roasts to extra-bold, and I’ll admit, the results were impressive. The flavor profile seemed optimized, and every cup had a rich, full-bodied taste that exceeded my old drip coffee maker.  

It’s the little things, though, that make this coffee maker feel smarter. Adjusting your cup size or strength is ridiculously easy, and there are five strength settings, six temperature options, and five cup sizes to pick from. It takes personalization to a level I hadn’t thought I needed until I saw how perfectly customizable it was!

[Check Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b0973yh74z/)

**Multistream Technology**  
I hadn’t paid much attention to the “Multistream Technology” mentioned in the specs until I used it. Essentially, instead of just spraying water through a single needle, the coffee maker saturates the grounds using multiple streams. I compared it with my old Keurig Classic, and this actually did enhance both aroma and taste. Even my roommate, who’s a coffee snob and usually side-eyes pod coffee, complimented it. This feature is quietly one of its game changers.

**Special Features for Iced Coffee Lovers**  
Here’s where my childhood obsession with iced coffee comes in handy. It has a setting designed to brew hot coffee extra strong, so when poured over ice, it doesn’t taste like someone sneezed into water (you know what I’m talking about if you’ve tried regular coffee over ice). While it won’t replace specialty iced coffee drinks from your favorite café, it’s a great convenience for summer mornings. Just be prepared to fiddle slightly with sizing so your cup doesn’t overflow.

**Benefits**  
• BrewID truly enhances flavor for tailored coffee experiences.  
• Compact, sleek, and modern design.  
• Multistream Technology fully saturates coffee grounds for aromatic notes.  

**Negatives**  
• The WiFi feature required some patience to set up properly.  
• Not the quietest coffee maker, so early-morning brews might disturb.  

**Target Audience**  
I feel like this coffee maker is aimed at busy but detail-oriented coffee lovers. If you're the type who experiments with different roasts and has firm preferences for strength and temperature, this will suit you perfectly. Plus, being able to save your favorite settings on your smartphone is great if you like consistency without much effort. Families or shared spaces could also benefit since the easy dial makes it user-friendly for everyone.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other single-serve brewers, such as the Nespresso Vertuo and regular Keurig models, the K-Supreme Plus Smart holds its ground. The Vertuo also offers variety but lacks the depth of customization I found here. Regular single-serve Keurigs might be cheaper, but they definitely don’t have the advanced features like BrewID or Multistream. This one feels more... refined, like it’s made for someone who’s graduated from ""just needing coffee."" That said, if you solely drink one or two very specific pods, you might find other models like the K-Elite meeting your needs just as well for less.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
It’s safe to say you’ll be paying a bit extra for all the smart features, but whether that’s worth it depends on how much you value your coffee experience. I see this as an investment for anyone who drinks multiple cups daily or serves coffee to guests often. Plus, the level of customization matches machines I’ve seen at double this price point. If you’re someone who always fantasizes about having the perfect cup at home, this product hits the mark.

1mcbykt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mcbykt/i21m_felt_invisible_at_dinner_with_my/,I(21M) Felt Invisible at Dinner with My Girlfriend(30F) and Her Friends.,"
Hey, first time posting here, been lurking on reddit for a year. I’m kinda freaking out and need advice, maybe i’m overthinking this.

I’m Julian, 21M, and my girlfriend Elena is 30F. Yes, I know the age gap’s a thing. 9 years, people always have something to say about it, but I’m a grown adult, alright and I get that it looks ""weird"" to some people, but it’s not like that. We’re in love, like, I can’t imagine my life without her. She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We’ve been together for about a year, and she’s so amazing, always looking out for me when I was in a really bad spot. I dropped out of community college last year cause I couldn’t handle classes and work, plus stuff at home was a total mess. My mom’s been struggling with drinking and mental health stuff since my dad died when I was a kid. I was stuck paying bills, keeping the house together, all that. It got so bad I had to crash with a friend, but that was rough too.

Me and Elena met when I was working at a coffee shop a couple blocks from her office at this big graphic design company that does branding for huge clients. She’s a senior designer there, super talented, not running the place but she has a solid role. She’d come in most mornings for her usual black coffee, sometimes a latte if she was in a good mood. We started talking while I made her drinks, first about the music on the shop’s playlist: we both love indie bands like Tame Impala and Phoebe Bridgers. Then we got into graphic design, cause I used to mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, making posters for my friends’ bands just for fun when I was younger. She’d talk about her work, like designing logos or client presentations etc

One day, she mentioned their team was short-staffed cause an office assistant quit, and they needed someone to handle stuff like emails, scheduling meetings, and organizing project files. I’d told her the coffee shop job sucked: It had bad pay and brutal hours. She asked if I’d ever thought about office work, and I was like, “Not really, but I’d try it.” She didn’t promise me anything, just said they were hiring and I should apply. I thought there was no way I’d get it, but I was desperate, so I sent my resume, got an interview, and somehow landed the job as a junior office assistant.


We kept talking at work, got super close, and a few months later, we started dating. When my friend’s lease ended and I had nowhere to go, she let me move into her apartment. She’s never made me feel like I owe her, and I’m so grateful. She’s always doing sweet stuff, like buying me gifts, shoes, watches, or picking out clothes she thinks I look good in and I trust her cause she’s got such good taste. It’s the first time I’ve felt very secure and at peace.

Last Friday, she had friends over for dinner. Now I’m really bad with new people: social anxiety makes me sweaty and quiet and really nervous. I tried to fit in, wore a t shirt she picked, but felt out of place. they’re her age, talking career stuff i don’t get. I tried holding her hand on the table to feel close, but she pulled away fast and kept talking like nothing. It hurt, like she was embarrassed of me or something. i sat there feeling dumb stupid and awkward

After her friends left, we were cleaning up in the kitchen, and I told her I felt ignored and mentioned the hand thing. I wasn’t trying to pick a fight, I swear, just wanted her to understand how tough it was for me. But she got annoyed and said I was “making everything about me” and that I’m “always so awkward” around her friends and it's not her fault I lack social skills. I’ve told her about my social anxiety, and she’s usually so supportive, and she's even seen me work through it even, but this time it felt like she was throwing it in my face.

I then asked why she pulled her hand away, and she said I was being “way too sensitive” and imagining stuff and that never happened. We started arguing louder, and yeah, I cried I was really frustrated. I hate fighting/or any sort of conflict with her. It genuinely makes me feel awful, and I felt so shut down. She said sorry later that night, but I couldn’t shake it and her apology didn’t feel sincere to me I felt like she just apologized for the sake of it.

The next day, I grabbed some clothes and went to my mom’s to get some space. My mom’s trying to stay sober, but it’s a roller coaster, and being there’s not great she just watches TV all day, barely talks and sleeps, its a bit awkward every time we talk but it’s a familiar place to be I guess. She noticed I had been quiet and asked what’s up, so I told her most of it and why we fought. She already knew about me and Elena. She wasn’t happy about the age gap at first when I told her we were dating, with all the chaos in my life back then, but she got over it when she saw I wasn’t gonna break up with her just cause people don’t get it. I told her I love her and I mean it so so much. I’m an adult, and this is my choice. She didn’t say much, but last night she said, “You gotta listen to your heart and pick what you really want, not what’s easy. What do you want?” I don’t even know how to answer that. I’m so confused right now.

Elena’s been texting, saying she’s sorry, but i haven’t replied. I don’t know if i’m being a jerk or just need time. I love her, but i hate feeling like i’m not enough.

TL;DR:
I (21M) love my girlfriend (30F), who helped me through a rough time and got me a job. But after a dinner with her friends where she brushed off my attempt to hold her hand, I felt embarrassed and ignored. I brought it up, we argued, and I left to stay at my mom’s for space. She’s apologized, but I haven’t responded. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or just protecting myself.",1,1753796991.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side, but that's stuff that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. I wouldn't say I have any set preferences in terms of appearances, but I do prefer being around a similar age. While I'm also not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

1mcbw5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mcbw5t/reveal_the_benefits_of_waterdrop_wd10ua_under/,Reveal the benefits of Waterdrop WD-10UA under sink water filter review today!,"Waterdrop WD-10UA—the product name instantly caught my attention because of my growing concerns about water quality. The description claimed it reduces PFAS, PFOA/PFOS, lead, chlorine, bad taste, and odor, so I was excited to try it out in my home. NSF/ANSI 42 certification is no small feat, and with its promise to last 8,000 gallons, the benefits sounded too good to pass up. Before diving into all its strengths and quirks, here’s my daily take after testing it for a month straight.

**Impressive Installation Experience**  
Plumbing-related products have always intimidated me. Tools? Check. Instruction manual? Check. Sweaty confusion? Double-check. However, this under-sink water filter shattered my usual experience. The system’s twist-and-lock construction and push-to-connect fittings were an absolute game-changer. It took no more than three minutes to install it. I didn’t even need help from my DIY-savvy neighbor! Plus, its compatibility with both 1/2"" and 3/8"" cold water pipes added flexibility to match various setups. For a wooden spoon-level plumbing novice like me, this effortless installation felt like a small victory.

[Check Waterdrop WD-10UA price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b083npw1dn/)

**Compact Yet Robust Design**  
Living in a modestly-sized apartment, under-sink space is always a premium. This filter’s dimensions—3.9"" L x 3.6"" W x 12.3"" H—felt surprisingly compact given its filtration power. It didn’t just fit in comfortably but still left room for all my cleaning supplies. The understated, sleek black finish also complemented my kitchen aesthetic. A friend visiting commented that it looked more modern and less clunky compared to older, more industrial filters she’d seen.

**Ability to Handle Tough Contaminants**  
The claims about removing PFAS, lead, and chlorine weren’t just marketing fluff. My water tasted noticeably cleaner—free of that unsettling metallic tang. The bad odor? Also gone. While I don’t own lab equipment to verify, knowing the filter meets NSF/ANSI 372 and 42 standards gave me peace of mind. It even excelled at reducing larger particles, which made me feel better about using it for both drinking and cooking. My morning coffee tastes way better now—smooth and devoid of that chlorinated aftertaste city water sometimes leaves behind.

**Pluses**  
- Smooth and quick installation process.  
- Effectively improves water taste and odor.  
- Reliable filtration backed by certifications like NSF/ANSI.  
- Compact, space-saving design fits under most sinks effortlessly.  

**Boons of Versatility**  
One feature I haven’t stopped raving about to my family is its versatility. You can install this in an RV, bathroom, or even an office workspace. My brother, who runs a small café, has been hunting for an affordable filtration system, and I recommended this to him. Not to mention, it's an amazing option for rental properties as it doesn’t involve invasive plumbing. Who thought a recommendation to landlords would come out of me, huh?

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite its many winning points, no product is without flaws, and this filter isn’t an exception.  
- The maximum water flow rate of 2.5 GPM can feel slower than expected for larger households.  
- While it reduces contaminants effectively, it’s not designed for TDS removal, which could confuse users new to water quality measurements.  
- Activated carbon from coconut shells—though eco-friendly—might cause concerns for individuals with specific shell-based allergies.

**Competitors in the Spotlight**  
Comparing this filter to others like the APEC WFS-1000 and CuZn UC-200 highlighted key strengths and weaknesses. The Waterdrop WD-10UA outshines them with its installation simplicity and smaller profile. However, the APEC WFS-1000 offers multi-stage filters for wider contaminant removal but takes longer to install. On the other hand, CuZn UC-200 focuses heavily on impressively fast water flow but sacrifices the compact size. For its price and abilities, the WD-10UA feels like a smart middle-ground—less hassle, still solid performance.

**Smart Spending**  
Evaluating its performance and long lifespan convinced me that this filter provides incredible value for its cost. Not having to frequently replace the filter (it lasts up to 8,000 gallons or one year) significantly lowers maintenance expenses over time. While its initial investment may feel higher than your run-of-the-mill pitcher filters, the savings on bottled water and improved peace of mind are well worth the trade-off.

1mcbvg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mcbvg4/why_is_the_best_portable_coffee_maker_oxo_rapid/,Why is the best portable coffee maker OXO Rapid Brewer making waves?,"Lightweight, portable, and impressively efficient, the OXO 8722500 caught my attention for its innovative take on coffee brewing. I wasn’t sure what to expect from this compact device, but after weeks of daily use, it’s safe to say my mornings have transformed in the most delightful way. Perfect for coffee enthusiasts who value convenience and control, this manual brewer promises a rich cup, no matter where you are. Yet, as much as it made me appreciate coffee anew, there are a few details worth noting before you dive in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
You can’t look at this coffee maker without admiring its minimalist aesthetic. Sporting a sleek black finish and slim cylindrical design, it fits right into any modern kitchen—or even a well-packed backpack for those on the go. Weighing just over a pound and standing at 10.5 inches tall, it’s incredibly lightweight without feeling cheap. The use of Tritan Renew—a plastic composed of 50% recycled content—adds a touch of eco-friendliness, while the built-in stainless steel filter means you can forget about running out of those ever-annoying paper coffee filters. The design also ensures all parts, except the pump, are dishwasher-safe, which is a lifesaver for busy people like me who detest prolonged clean-ups.

**Functionality and Usability**  
The operation is fully manual, and while that may not be everyone’s cup of tea (or coffee, in this case), I found it oddly therapeutic. Add your preferred grind, tamp it with the included tamper, and pour water to the fill line; that’s all it takes. The rainmaker showerhead, which evenly distributes water over the coffee bed, really impressed me. It’s a small detail, but it makes a big difference in getting the most flavor out of the grounds. For those who juggle between hot coffee in the morning and cold brew on those lazy afternoons, its versatility is incredible. Brewing takes only two minutes for hot coffee and around five for cold brew. Plus, it’s so convenient to dilute the concentrate with water, milk, or even ice to achieve your preferred strength.  

[Grab OXO 8722500 at the best price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)

**Performance and Output**  
How does it taste, you ask? Pretty darn good. Despite its small stature, the OXO brewer manages to punch above its weight when it comes to flavor. The concentrated coffee it produces is rich and smooth, great not just for regular coffee but also for more unique creations like Vietnamese coffee or affogato. The pump feature for dispensing the concentrate is a clever addition—straightforward to use, and it locks in place when not needed, making it spill-proof for travel. That said, novices may need a bit of practice to nail the right grind size and water ratio.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and portable, fitting seamlessly into your commute or travel plans  
- Quick brewing for both hot coffee (2 minutes) and cold brew (5 minutes)  
- Built-in stainless-steel filter for hassle-free brewing without disposable filters  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify the clean-up process  

**Critiques**  
Like any product, this brewer isn’t without its imperfections, which should be noted:  
- The pump mechanism, though efficient, occasionally feels a bit stiff initially.  
- Not ideal for larger groups or heavy coffee drinkers due to its small batch size.  
- Requires fine-ground coffee for optimal results, which may be a hassle for those without a grinder.  

**Competitive Options**  
When compared to products like the AeroPress or the Hario V60, the OXO Rapid Brewer holds its own in terms of portability and simplicity. While the AeroPress offers a bit more control over brewing pressure, the Rapid Brewer wins for speed and sheer convenience—and without the need for additional accessories like paper filters. The Hario V60 often outshines with its depth of flavor but demands a level of finesse and patience that some users may not have. What truly sets the OXO apart is the ability to prepare both hot and cold coffee with little effort in such a small footprint. However, if it’s volume you’re after, neither the OXO nor its competitors in this size category will fully satisfy.  

**Money's Worth**  
For what it offers in convenience, design, and versatility, the price point feels justifiable, though perhaps slightly steep if you’re purely looking for a home brewer. Its true value lies in its portability; this is a product for someone on the move or someone, like me, who appreciates a mean cup of coffee wherever I go. Plus, the cost savings on travel coffees and filters start to add up quickly, making it a sensible choice in the long run.

Does anyone have a recommendation? Priorities, in this order, are quality brew, accessible interface or really good app, and ability to make a two-or-more-person batch with minimal effort.

I have anecdotally read that Sierra bears will open your pack and steal the bear can if you're not looking. I have also read that bears will steal the can right out of your campsite while your back is turned. 

Here are my questions. 

(Please be kind, these may be stupid questions and I may be overthinking it but I truly do not know - I have mostly hiked around the AT and everyone seems to sleep with their food and not care about this at all...)

* What do you do when you set your pack down for a swim or a break during the day? Do you take the can out or just leave it inside?
* When you get to camp and start setting up, do you keep the bear can inside your pack while pitching your tent, or do you have to carry it away from camp first?
* What about cooking? If Mr Bear is waltzing in to steal my can off the ground while I am right there, what's stopping him from walking up to my cookpot and stealing that? Are people really cooking 100 feet from camp? I have truly never seen anyone do this but its the protocol so wanted to know...
* What about my cookpot? No way I can fit that in the can until night 2 at the earliest (some long food carries, I can barely even get the food into the can for the biggest stretch). Do I leave that next to the can? Mostly just boiling water in this but mornings it will have coffee. 
* What about my pack smelling? My pack will certainly smell like food, especially the brain and hipbelt pockets where I store snacks or that days lunch. My water bottles will sometimes smell like electrolyte powder. Are these things not just as bad as eating near my tent?

1mcblh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mcblh2/explore_if_the_szhetefu_french_press_coffee_maker/,Explore if the SZHETEFU French Press Coffee Maker Review Matches Its Bold Claims,"The SZHETEFU 34ozFP-01 French Press really sparked my mornings in a way I didn’t expect. I’ve tested plenty of coffee products in my day, and this one intrigued me with its combination of thoughtful design and simplicity. It promised durability, easy cleaning, and excellent heat retention. Using the French press daily over the past couple of weeks made me appreciate both its strong points and areas where it could use a tweak. Of course, with any product, there’s always a balance between expectations and reality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the elegant look of the sturdy stainless steel body, finished in a striking black. It manages to combine a classic aesthetic with a modern vibe that worked perfectly in my kitchen. The durability of the stainless steel construction stood out immediately too. It doesn’t feel flimsy or like something you’d replace in a year. The compact size might sound a bit understated for its advertised 34-ounce capacity, but it’s surprisingly roomy. This French press feels like it could survive being jostled around on busy mornings. That said, this isn’t the lightest coffee maker I’ve used—it definitely has a bit of weight to it due to the steel, making it less portable. 

**Ease of Use for Daily Brewing**  
Using this coffee press was as straightforward as it gets. The manual operation ensures no confusing buttons or complicated instructions—just the satisfying plunge that presses out the coffee grounds. The precise plunger system lets you control the steeping time, which really gave me the flexibility to tweak the strength exactly to my liking. One day, I might prefer a robust dark roast, and the next, a lighter brew. I noticed the adjustable brew strength lives up to its claim here. 

[Check SZHETEFU 34ozFP-01 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dhqp5lv1/)

**Thermal Retention and Insulated Design**  
Most mornings, I’d make my coffee and sip slowly while working, so the thermal aspect of this French press was a deciding factor for me. The double-wall insulated construction did keep my coffee hot for a decent amount of time. I didn’t feel rushed to drink it before it got cold. Compared to other glass French presses I’ve owned, this one was a winner in this department. However, while it retained heat well, the exterior definitely warms up, so you might want to watch your hands! 

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
The ease of cleaning genuinely surprised me. Everything disassembles quite intuitively, and rinsing it with water was enough most of the time. Even when I forgot to clean it immediately after use (it happens more than I admit), it didn’t give me trouble. It’s refreshing to not feel like cleaning the coffee maker is a whole task on its own. Still, if you don’t love manual cleaning, this might be less appealing, but hey—it comes with the territory of French presses.

**Advantages**  
- Durable steel body that feels built to last.  
- Excellent heat retention due to double-wall insulation.  
- Adjustable brew strength for personalized coffee.  
- Large 34 oz capacity suitable for families or small gatherings.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The steel exterior can become warm to the touch after use.  
- Slightly on the heavier side, making it less suitable for portability.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this French press to similar premium options, like the Bodum Chambord or Frieling stainless steel models, I found a mix of advantages and trade-offs. The SZHETEFU excels in thermal retention over the glass Chambord and boasts sturdier construction than many entry-level presses. However, the Frieling press offered a slightly more ergonomic plunger experience and felt a tad more refined in terms of polish. For someone like me, who appreciates good value, SZHETEFU hits the right middle ground between higher-end features and reasonable cost.

**Quality for Price**  
For what this product delivers, the pricing feels justified. It offers higher durability and performance at a price point that’s accessible compared to more premium-tier presses. If you’re brewing coffee daily like me and need something reliable, this investment seems like a strong contender. That said, if you’re someone who occasionally makes coffee or prefers lightweight options, there are slightly cheaper alternatives to explore.

1mcblg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mcblg4/burger_feels_special/,Burger Feels Special,"""Okay, fine buddy, I hear you,"" I said, looking down at my stomach. It was a long day at work and I had only eaten oats for breakfast. I was running on coffee the whole day and now I was hungry.

""I said I hear you, just a few minutes,"" I said, looking for a food shop or restaurant.

Far into the distance I saw a signboard with bold glowing letters. ""BURGER FEELS."" I read out the name. ""Look, we found something!""

I parked my car and made my way to the main entrance. A giant glowing burger above the door flickered to welcome me.

""Jeez,"" I said before opening the door and found a table. Which wasn’t hard because the restaurant was mostly empty. A family with two kids sat not too far from me and were already picking up their things to leave.

""What would you like today, sir?"" a waiter said, handing me the menu. There were all sorts of burgers—different flavours, vegan, different meat options. I rolled the pages to find one at the very end: Burger Feels Special – Burger so good you will feel like one.

""Haha, what!"" I chuckled. It was a weird claim—who feels like a burger?

""I'll have this one,"" I said, handing back the menu.

""Are you sure?"" the waiter asked with a concerned look.

""Yes, I'm having the special today."" He nodded and went back to the counter. The person at the counter shot me a look.

""Weird people,"" I said, waiting for my special burger.

The waiter brought the burger. It looked awfully simple for a special burger—cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and a patty.

""We hope the wait was worth it, sir,"" the waiter said before putting the plate down and left.

""Oh, God,"" a moan left my mouth as I took the first bite. It was really that good.

""They weren't lying,"" I said before taking another bite.

""Well I do feel like a burger,"" I said jokingly with a laugh. But that laughter faded the very next moment.

My chest throbbed with pain, I couldn't breathe. I tried to get up but collapsed on the floor with my knees bent.

My legs started expanding. The chest pain was getting unbearable. I, in a hurry, opened up my shirt and bam—huge green leaves of lettuce sprung out of my chest.

""No... what is happening, help!"" I screamed. But the waiter looked at me once and looked away.

I opened my shirt further. Dark grill lines started appearing on my stomach, the colour turning a dark brown. My legs were now merged into one and were expanding into a big round blob. I tried moving my arms but they were red and melting. I couldn't even look down. My neck was expanding into a giant tomato slice.

I tried to look away but my head felt too heavy. Something soft and white was making its way out of it—like bread.

""No!"" I opened my mouth to scream but a lot of cheese came out of it. I could no longer move. There was no going back. I accepted my fate.

In the end, I felt like a burger.

1mcbkrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mcbkrh/hr_wronged/,[HR] Wronged,"It was about twelve o'clock as I stood looking down from the high point on the estate road at the centuries-old Downview Hall. It brooded there, austere and solemn under the darkening sky. A blustery wind was rising, and light snow began to swirl down from the dirty grey clouds overhead. A great forest surrounded the building on three sides, and covered many miles before finally thinning out at the foot of the high downland. 



I had answered an advert in the local paper for a caretaker to look after the place for a month while the owners, a Mr & Mrs Da Silva were abroad. The house had a troubled reputation, an old boy in the local pub had told me that it was haunted, and unexplained phenomena had been witnessed there over the years. What the next few weeks held for me in this remote and somewhat foreboding corner of the county was uncertain. 



The wind had risen to a near-gale force north-easterly by this time, and shivering as the snow fell thicker, I retreated to the car for shelter. Then slowly and carefully descended the drive to my temporary home. Stepping from the vehicle in front of the Hall entrance, I gazed up at the building. It was constructed mostly of stone, and spread over three floors, with four windows on either side of the massive doorway on each level. The roof was slate, and from it massive chimneys reached skyward. I hurried up the steps to the imposing oak door, and after struggling with the key it swung open with a shriek. Entering, I shut the door firmly behind me, leaving the winter storm to look after itself. 

  


Inside, the house was warm but dimly lit, but the snow outside gave a reflected glow enabling me to see my surroundings fairly easily. Several rooms led off from the hall, and a huge ornate wooden staircase curved up to the first floor. I crossed to the light switches and clicked them on. To my relief, the room brightened up, at least the electric supply was okay. But I had my doubts how reliable it might prove to be. Especially with a snowstorm raging outside, and set to remain for up to a week according to the forecast. As I left my belongings on the kitchen table, I noticed an envelope with ‘Jim’ written on it propped up against the work surface. I decided to read it later and returned to the hallway and opened the nearest door. 

  


It was a library, furnished in an old-fashioned style. The walls were wood-panelled, and on two sides shelves were stacked floor to ceiling with books. One section stood apart, the subject matter didn’t cheer me much, all dealt with the occult and magic. As I stood perusing the dusty old volumes, the lights suddenly flickered, dimmed and went out. At the same time, the door swung slowly shut. Standing there in the gloom, a faint feeling of fear crept over me. ‘‘It’s just the wind,’’ I said out loud, trying to reassure myself, ‘‘And these bloody electrics have got to be sorted out!’’ I crossed to the door, it opened easily enough, and passing back into the hallway the lights came on full and bright. I sat down at the hall table and thought for a while. Flickering lights and a door closing of its own accord could easily be explained, the storm outside was severe, the power supply unreliable, and the house was not exactly draft proof. I wasn't ready just yet to put these things down to ghostly causes, despite the building's history.

  
  
  
  


I decided to go over the rest of the house, and slowly climbed the winding staircase to the first floor. Opening a door at random, I peeked inside, it was furnished in the same dated style as the library, and didn’t look very inviting. The top level was similar, and after some thought I settled on a large room with a decent enough bed to use for my stay in this eerie old pile. It was at the rear of the Hall, and the view from the windows was impressive. The park climbed gradually up until it reached the boundary of the dense forest. Everywhere was now thickly covered with snow, and the trees swayed wildly in the blustery wind, which I could faintly hear roaring through the branches. 

  


A loud thump made me start and turn around sharply to stare out of the door which stood ajar. Venturing onto the landing, I looked up and down the corridor but nothing was to be seen. An odd effect now occurred, as I stared down the long passage it seemed to lengthen and grow darker, and my eyes found it difficult to focus with any clarity. Getting tired, I thought, and with a shudder returned to the bedroom window. From the corner of my eye I caught a movement at the edge of the wood and thought I saw a dark figure half-hidden among the trees. At the same time, I heard the sound on the landing once more and averted my gaze, when I looked again the figure was gone, if it had even been there at all. The place was starting to make me jumpy and play with my imagination, and the surroundings were creepy enough to invite the unwanted thoughts that were forming in my mind. 

  


A coffee and a smoke were needed, so I descended to the ground floor, stopping on the way down twice to listen, but heard nothing more. The kitchen was bright and cheery, in sharp contrast to the other rooms. It was well stocked with food and drink, my hosts had evidently made sure my stay would be adequately catered for. I was thankful for this, getting out to the local village for more provisions would be nigh on impossible at present. I had the owner's Range Rover at my disposal, but the roads were probably close to impassable by now, and I wasn’t overly keen to try venturing out in it. They would be less than pleased if I left their expensive vehicle stranded miles from anywhere

  


I sat back in my chair and lit another cigarette, the coffee was good and the room warm and comfortable. The ground floor was generally well heated, upstairs was chilly, but I preferred a cool bedroom. The cost of keeping a place this size at a tolerable temperature in winter was doubtless considerable. I set up my laptop on the spacious kitchen table and then read the note left for me by the owners. It contained a short list of things to attend to in their absence along with the Wi-Fi code and ended with the words ‘Thanks Jim…enjoy your stay, Mark Da Silva’. I was attempting to write my first book, a ghost story ironically enough. Progress so far had been slow, hopefully the surroundings and atmosphere would provide some much-needed inspiration. The four weeks' employment had appealed to me from the first, as it gave me seclusion and peace and quiet to give the project my full attention. A world away from modern life and all its inherent distractions.

  


I decided to take a walk through the estate, the wind was still blowing hard, but the snow had eased slightly. The half glimpsed figure at the forest edge, real or imaginary, still bothered me. I would walk up the park and have a good look around. So after changing into my warmest jacket and a sturdy pair of boots I set off. A huge drift had blown up against the front door, and the cars were buried beneath wintery blankets. The gale was bitter out of the north-east, and the light snow stung my eyes. However, after rounding the corner of the Hall I found it slightly less ferocious, as the building afforded some degree of shelter from the icy blast. The grounds were extensive, and several majestic old oak trees roared in the squally gusts. 

  


Progress up the incline to the woodland boundary was slow and laborious. Having gained the tree line I trudged slowly along, peering into the dense dark interior. The wildly swaying boughs and hissing wind made me shudder, the aura given off by this desolate place was unfriendly…sinister even. As I stared intently into the forest depths two sharp cracks sounded, but nothing could be seen. In my heightened state of unease it made me think of footsteps on dead branches. By now dusk was coming on, and as I stood looking down at the Hall, I noticed a curious thing, a light shone from one of the ground floor windows, possibly the library. I was certain I hadn’t turned any on while exploring the rooms that morning. Deciding to check things out at once I set off down the hill. The snow had begun to fall heavily again and whirled crazily about in the tempestuous wind that hadn’t eased all day. A wild night was in prospect, and hot food and a warm bed were all I needed at this point.

  


Glancing up at the house as I walked towards it, I pulled up short suddenly. For a moment I couldn’t think what had brought me to such an abrupt halt, and then realisation dawned…the house was in total darkness. Kicking away the drift that had once again accumulated against the front door I entered the hallway and stood for a moment getting my breath back after the hard trek down from the disquieting forest. To my relief the lights were working despite the atrocious weather conditions, and the heating was on, so cheered by the comfortable surroundings I crossed the hallway and entered the library. Nothing seemed out of place, tonight however I would sleep here. The huge sofa would make a more than adequate bed, and the cosy kitchen was just across the hall. I stood at the window and stared out at the great wood at the top of the rise. But all was dark in the late afternoon gloom. The unexplained illumination would have to remain a mystery for now. I passed an uneventful night, only the turbulent gusts outside roused me occasionally. I slept well, and rose at first light to face a second day in the snowbound old mansion.

  


Sitting at the drawing room table I lit a cigarette and sipped my coffee, the view from the window was wintry in the extreme. Dark snow clouds scudded swiftly across the sky, driven on by the blustery wind. The conditions were if anything worsening, with no let up forecast for days to come. At some point I would have to try to reach the village for more provisions. The kitchen supplies wouldn’t last the month I had agreed to look after the house. So, with this thought in mind I ventured out to clear the snow off the vehicles. Extracting the cars from the deep drifts took a lot longer than anticipated. But eventually I was able to climb into the owner's Range Rover, breathing heavily after my exertions. With fingers crossed, I turned the key in the ignition, and to my great relief the motor roared into life. As I sat letting the engine come up to temperature, I noticed a row of what looked like converted stables, and remembered being told that the cars were usually garaged there when not in use for any length of time. With the snow once more falling heavily, I decided to move them under cover immediately, as by the following morning they would doubtless need digging out again. 

  


With that done, I stood for a moment wondering what to do next, and decided to walk up the long winding drive to the Hall gates and see whether the access road was at all passable. On reaching the entrance I glanced up and down the lonely lane, it was desolation itself. Obviously no vehicle had a hope of getting through the deep drifts at present. At this, the highest point of the estate, the wind had reached gale force. The woods roared, branches clashing together, and the snow flew nearly horizontally. The bitter conditions were too much, and so I began the treacherous walk downhill to the house, the storm thankfully at my back and hustling me along the icy track. After several minutes of unsteady progress down the slippery incline I stopped in an attempt to light a cigarette. As I reached into my pocket for the lighter a strange feeling of apprehension washed over me. Something had changed, and looking back up at the Hall gates it seemed as though I had barely covered any distance at all since starting for the house. And indeed the old building appeared almost as far away as when I set off. Through the thickly falling snow it looked hazy, unfocused, like a desert mirage. 

  


Thoroughly unsettled I glanced back at the way I had come and started violently as I beheld again the dark figure at the forest's edge. It stood motionless, clad from head to foot in black fluttering garments. A hood obscured the features, and whether it was male or female was impossible to judge. Just then a furious gust blew snow into my face, stinging my eyes and making them water profusely. When they cleared sufficiently to allow me to see again I gazed in disbelief at what I saw, a second figure had joined the first. It, too, was cloaked in the same dark clothes, but appeared slighter in build and shorter. A man and woman possibly, and both were observing me implacably. Panic gripped me, and as I turned to run for the Hall I slipped and fell heavily in the thick snow. Rising unsteadily to my feet, bruised and shook up, I looked again in their direction, and saw …nothing! Shaking I fumbled a cigarette from the packet, and with trembling hands lit it, drawing the smoke deep into my lungs. The house was again in focus and sharply outlined against its wooded background. The distance to it had perceptibly shortened to what I had thought only moments earlier.

  


Despite an almost overwhelming urge to return to the safety of the Hall, I forced myself to stand my ground and think things through. Did these beings, whatever they were, have power over one's perception, and could they influence the local environment? Could I be viewing the Hall and estate from the perspective of another time and space at the point of their materialisation? What was their connection with the house, had they been summoned there by occult means? The books in the library clearly indicated a strong interest in the subject, maybe more than just curiosity. Perhaps real magical work had been practised here either in recent times or further back in the estate's past. Then again were they perhaps once the owners, now trapped in a never ending limbo to forever roam the place, unable to move on? My initial scepticism was slowly being eroded, and I realised that I was now coming more and more under the influence of this forgotten old manor buried deep amongst its haunted domain. With one last glance at the spectral forest I continued on to the Hall, my mind full of otherworldly thoughts.

  


That evening sat at the kitchen table with coffee, cigarettes and a decent brandy. I wondered what my next move should be. I decided to contact an old friend who had a deep interest and extensive experience in such matters. After emailing him with all the pertinent details I sat back in my chair smoking lost in thought. An idea occurred to me, if the figures had a connection to the house a thorough investigation of the place might reveal something to reinforce this theory. The house had many pictures on its walls, maybe these could provide a clue to the mystery. I decided to do this the following morning, prowling about the gloomy manor at night wasn’t ideal and full daylight would make the task a lot easier. 

  


My phone rang, shattering the hush of the kitchen and making me jump. It was my friend Tom, and he was full of questions regarding my somewhat cryptic email. After assuring him that I was ok, he told me to tell him the name of the house and its location along with all that had occurred since my arrival at the estate. He listened to everything I had to say without uttering a word, and when I was finished he began to speak. He knew of the Hall, and its reputation as a troubled house stretched back far into the past. The owners from present times to centuries gone by, had not been held in any great esteem and many charges of black magic and devil worship had been whispered by frightened villagers down through the years. And the place was mostly shunned by the local inhabitants. I was dumbfounded, I had no clue as to what kind of contract I had entered into, and what my friend Tom had told me was thoroughly unsettling. I had to ask, did he think the present occupants had carried on the sinister practices from times gone by? By way of answer he quoted a line from a well known horror story that ‘evil houses attract evil people’. 

  


This troubled me even more, and I asked him point-blank what my next course of action should be. ‘’Leave tomorrow’’ he said, ‘‘no ifs or buts Jim, just get out.’’ Telling him that I was reluctant to do this and wished to investigate further didn’t go down well. ’’Listen’’ he said, ‘‘I know a great deal more about this business than you ever will, and I’ve given you my advice.’’ ‘‘If you must stay, keep in close contact with me at all times.’’ ‘‘Weather permitting, I'll try to get down to you as soon as possible.’’ After wishing me well he hung up, leaving me in a sea of worry and doubt and wondering how to proceed next. 

  


Early in the morning of the third day I started on my exploration of the Hall, searching for any possible clues that could give me a better understanding of what I was now dealing with. Outside the wind still howled through the estate and dark snow clouds were gathering in the north-east once more. Another heavy fall seemed imminent, and travel was now impossible even if I had decided to leave at short notice. Tom had rung to check I was ok, and told me that he was totally snowed in and had no chance of visiting at present. This news increased my feeling of isolation further, and I had to face up to the fact that for now I was practically a prisoner in this house of shadows and unknown dread. With difficulty, I shook off the anxiety and climbed to the top floor to start my search. The rooms yielded little to help in my quest for some understanding into the history of the place. Many portraits adorned the walls but despite studying them closely I could see little of any use that might provide a link to what I was witnessing. Eventually I moved down to the first floor and resumed searching once more. 

  


One room appeared to be in use and personal possessions were placed on the bedside tables, evidently the owner's own bedroom. Frustratingly there were no photographs of any sort that could have at least given me an idea what my employers looked like. Strange this I thought, but nothing surprised me any more in this strangest of places. As I stood musing, a large picture hanging above the fireplace drew my attention. It was a landscape view of the rear of the Hall with the great forest as a background. I inspected it closely, again nothing seemed of note, not even any people to give it life. But wait…was there the suggestion of a faint outline of two figures half hidden in the tree line? I peered intently at the place in the picture and realised that this was the very spot I had walked along only hours earlier. The unknown artist had obviously intended to give the likeness a blurred ill-defined quality. 

  


This was a revelation to me, proof that showed a definite connection to what I had seen the previous day. At the bottom of the canvas was a date, 1810, exactly two centuries ago. How far back in time had this place been troubled by its unearthly visitants? I took several photos of the painting, having a record confirming the truth of my ghostly sightings was essential, and these I would mail to Tom without delay. Spurred on by this discovery I continued my search on the first floor, but nothing more of significant interest was to be found. 

  


Descending to the ground level I made straight for the library, if any room was likely to yield any further information to help me, this would be the one. The occult volumes had to be my first line of enquiry, who knew what these might reveal. My phone pinged just as I was carrying a selection of books to the table. Tom had received my photos, and was intrigued with what they revealed. He promised to continue his own investigations, and would be in touch with any new information directly. I sat down and started to look through the volumes I had selected. All were dusty with age, the pages yellowed and brittle. Many were dated from several centuries ago and printed in Latin, not a very helpful start I thought, I hadn’t a hope of being able to decipher these ancient old tomes. 

  


Rising from my chair I once more scanned the shelves, seeking anything that could assist me in gaining further help to unravel the mystery that I was immersed in. I noticed a book that had hitherto escaped my attention, it was much smaller than all the rest and had been hidden by the volumes I had removed. I drew it out and turned it over in my hands. It wasn't a printed work, but something much different. And as I opened it to the first page a surge of excitement ran through me. It was an old notebook, very thin, due to many pages having been ripped out. The few that remained were filled with dense spidery handwriting. This was indeed something that could very possibly be of great assistance, and I carried it back to the table, eager to peruse its contents. 

  


Glancing outside I noticed the snow had once again begun to fall thickly. This was getting serious, my window of escape from this place now teetered on the brink, and if I delayed any longer it would be impossible. But, as I reminded myself, it had been my choice to stay, so I would have to live with it and make the best of the situation. I turned my attention to the notebook, the few pages that remained held no clues, just mundane family matters. However, at the end I found these two brief paragraphs….

  


***12th January 1901***



***I have seen them again while walking with my dog along the forest edge. Freezing weather still grips us, and thick snow carpets the estate, with a wind biting and blustery. I had stopped to light my pipe, when the sensation I have come to know as the herald of their appearance came upon me. As before a giddiness took hold and my surroundings swam before my eyes, the grounds, and Hall appearing as if shrouded in fog, stretched and distorted. I knew they would be there before I even looked along the tree line. And there they stood, vaguely defined, immovable as always, gazing at me implacably though their features were hidden under the heavy hoods that covered any detail of a face. I have yet to see them anywhere else on the estate, they seem rooted to this location like statues, unable to move from their allotted space in time. Forever trapped in this domain until the wrong dealt to them by my forefathers is righted. The burden has fallen on me, and now I must make amends. The dog barked furiously, I know he sees them, and this shook me from my musings with a start. Even before I looked I knew the figures would be gone, and so it was, the spell broke, and my surroundings came back into a natural healthy view once more.***

  


***13th February 1901***



***My efforts have been in vain. I am unable to release the poor souls from their earthly prison. My health is failing, and I know the time left to me is short. For so many years I have done nothing to right this terrible wrong. Mostly through fear and cowardice. And now I know I never will. I leave these few lines for those who come after me. I pray they will eventually settle this injustice once and for all. The forest holds the key, of that I am certain. Search there and endeavour to…***

  


Here the writing finished abrubtly, I was frustrated that no explicit details of the crime done to these poor unfortunates was recorded. Why had the author left his notes unfinished, what had interrupted him? The missing pages probably held more information regarding the mystery, but it was a major breakthrough nonetheless, and hopefully would assist me greatly. I slowly closed the notebook and sat back, amazed by what I had just read. I would ring Tom with these new revelations tomorrow when he returned home from a business trip to London. Furthermore, I had a definite theory forming in my head, and was keen to know if he thought I was on the right track. After a coffee and smoke in the kitchen, I once again ventured out into the frigid grounds heading for that now familiar location. The snow was so thick it made progress slow and tedious, would this arctic blast ever end? Eventually I gained the forest's edge and walked slowly along, watching and listening intently. A flock of Jackdaws shot overhead calling loudly to each other. I watched them swoop down towards the Hall and land on the roof, where they strutted about excitedly. 

  


I was taking my cigarettes from my pocket when a tremendous gust blew the packet from my freezing fingers. Rushing to retrieve them, I bent down, and the world swam before my eyes. Again the Hall and grounds had stretched and lengthened in aspect, the house murky and indistinct. I turned to face the woods, and there they were. Rooted in place amongst the wildly swaying trees. I took several paces towards them, fear abandoned now. Only a wish to assist these unfortunate shades of trapped souls. Although I had moved, I was no nearer to them. The distance between us remained fixed in time. In frustration, I shouted loudly…’’What do you want from me?’’ ‘‘Let me help!’’ I held my breath, watching for any sign that they could understand my intentions were honourable. After what seemed like an interminable pause the smaller figure raised an arm, and pointed back into the forest. I stared in the direction indicated, and tried in vain to move closer. As I did, my eyes blurred, then cleared, and my surroundings as on the previous day came back into their normal perspective.

  


I was alone once more amongst the snow and roaring wind. I made a marker from fallen branches, so the exact spot could be easily found again. I would return in the morning, and make a thorough search for any clues to solve the mystery once and for all. In the morning Tom rang to check on me, and deliver some astounding new information. He could now reveal the crucial missing pieces of the puzzle regarding the fate of the wronged spectres. In the late seventeen hundreds, a brother and sister in their early twenties were part of the staff at the Hall, and according to Tom’s in depth research had lost their lives in a botched occult ritual. According to his sources they hadn’t been willing participants. In a panic the owners and other members of the circle quickly buried them, in an unspecified location somewhere on the estate grounds. The scandal had somehow been hushed up, probably through bribery or threats of violence. Lords of the manor had been powerful figures during this time, and no criminal charges were ever made. 

  


Tom then asked the question I knew was coming, what did I intend to do next? I would search the place in the forest that was marked for any evidence of a burial. A little over three weeks remained until the Da Silva's were due to return, after that any further investigation was out of the question. I’d come this far, at the very least I had to try to find a solution to the centuries old injustice. Tom received my plan of action without enthusiasm, advising me to be very careful how I proceeded. ‘’If you come a cropper in that forest and injure yourself, you’ll be properly screwed.’’ ‘‘No-one will be able to help you, and freezing to death if you’re unable to get back to the Hall is a real possibility.’’ Weather conditions in his part of the country had improved slightly, and he could possibly try to get to me in a day or so. Could I wait until he got there? I thanked him for his concern, but I was determined to explore immediately. ‘’Ok, he said, take care, and for god's sake make sure you have your phone with you.’’ 

  


I hung up and sat back in my chair, deep in thought. About five hours of daylight remained, long enough for at least a cursory look around the location I had marked. Twenty minutes later I was on my way to that known place. I carried a small rucksack over my shoulder, containing two phones, one being a backup device I had retrieved from my car, a bottle of water and some snacks. Tom's warning of possible mishaps in the forest hadn’t been completely ignored. The weather was still atrocious, the snow and biting wind held sway, and no improvement seemed likely in the short term. I struggled up the incline to the forest's edge, cursing the elements loudly. 

  


Having gained the woodland perimeter I stood for a while regaining my breath, it had been a hard slog from the house. I found the marker easily enough, and after a brief glance back at the Hall stepped into the dark interior. Walking beneath the howling trees, I looked closely for any sign of disturbed ground. Everywhere was covered with fallen branches and thick undergrowth, and I tripped over more than once. Tom’s warning about possible mishaps in this storm blasted place hit home, and I continued very cautiously. I searched fruitlessly for over an hour, and when I finally stopped for a cigarette and some water, I was deep within the forest. The light had begun to fade, and realising how far I had to walk to regain the boundary I started back, struggling through the dead falls, but still alert for anything that might be a clue to help solve this strange mystery I was enmeshed in. 

  


Pushing through yet another tangled thicket of snow covered bushes I came upon something that looked significant. A rectangle of noticeably flatter ground presented itself, fairly clear of undergrowth and obviously not a natural feature. This could be the breakthrough I had hoped for, and would be the focal point of the investigation. I took several photos of the area for Tom's benefit, then walked gingerly over the level earth. It was frozen solid, and any digging would probably be next to impossible without some warmer weather to assist me. The next problem was finding the place again, we could easily walk in circles amongst the dense woods and still not find it. 

  


A possible solution occured to me, extracting the backup phone from my rucksack and checking its battery and ringtone volume I placed it in a small carrier bag and fastened it to the bushes securely. Hopefully it would survive the coming night and allow us to ring it the following day. Nearing the forest edge I once more caught my foot in a tangled clump of broken wood and fell heavily, twisting my ankle and bruising my knees. I rose unsteadily to my feet, but despite the pain I was able to walk without too much trouble, a broken bone would be potentially disastrous, and a safe return to the house was now my priority. Before leaving I made another marker to assist us the following day. I reached Downview after what seemed like an endless journey and stood in the warm hallway, bruised and sore but thankful I had accomplished my search relatively unscathed. 

  


Later, I rang my friend and brought him up to speed with the latest developments. He was relieved I had escaped any serious repercussions, and praised me for having the courage to undertake the perilous venture at all. He was intrigued with the pictures of the level ground, and felt that this must be the clue that might explain the whole unearthly mystery. The wintry weather in his part of the country was easing, and temperatures were rising, so he was hopeful that in possibly forty-eight hours he could be with me. A colleague with extensive knowledge in such matters had suggested to him a possible solution that was well worth trying. ‘‘I'll tell you all about it when I see you’’ he remarked somewhat cryptically. I mused over our conversation for a long time, intrigued as to what this might be. Wholesale excavations at the newly found landmark seemed highly unlikely to me given the frozen ground, and at present I couldn’t remotely imagine what the new idea might be. Exhausted, I went to bed, everything ached, but I was slightly more cheerful, maybe events were turning a corner and the end to this strange affair was in sight. 

  


The following morning brought a welcome surprise, the sun shone brightly from a cloudless sky. The wind had dropped, and no snow had fallen the previous night. I stood on the Hall steps with my coffee enjoying the dramatic change in the weather, the air felt softer, and the huge icicles hanging from the roof dripped steadily. A warm front from the south west was moving in, and a big thaw seemed imminent. However the forecast predicted only a temporary reprieve from the icy conditions, and more snow was expected. Later I would have another look around at the forest's edge and see if anything fresh was evident. 

  


By early afternoon I was on my way to the newly marked location. The change in temperature was dramatic, the snow was melting fast and the parkland was exposed in places, making progress easy. I was keen to find out if my phone had made it through the night, and made straight to the boundary. Walking in what I hoped was a reasonably straight line I rang the backup phone. At first I heard nothing, but after more unsteady progress a faint sound came to my ears. Gaining ground the unmistakable ringtone echoed through the trees. I hurried forward, and in a short time emerged from the tangled trees into the clearing. After checking that the phone had sufficient power to last another night I returned to the house full of hope, for the first time since my arrival I felt as though fate had at last dealt me a winning hand. That evening Tom rang and announced his intention to visit the following day. The roads had improved greatly, and he expected to be with me in the morning. 

 

The next day brought an unexpected call from Mark Da Silva, they were returning early to attend to an important family matter that needed immediate attention, and anticipated being home in two days. This came as something of a shock, the time remaining to us was just forty-eight hours. At eleven Tom arrived, and we greeted each other warmly, he’d had a good journey, and the local roads were fairly clear of snow and ice. I told him about Da Silva’s call, but he didn’t seem overly bothered. ‘‘What has to be done won’t take long’’ he said, and we can start anytime you wish.’’ ‘‘Let’s go inside’’ I suggested, ‘‘and you can tell me all about it.’’ Seated at the kitchen table with coffees, Tom outlined his plan of action. A colleague who had extensive experience of situations like ours had given Tom a spoken ritual that could hopefully be used to enable our trapped souls to move on. It was short, and required no great in depth knowledge to conduct, just a belief that it would work. I was willing to try anything at this point, and it would be our only chance, time had more or less run out to put an end to this injustice.



That afternoon, Tom and I stood at the forest's edge next to the branch marker. The sky had darkened, and the wind was rising, fitting to the occasion, I mused. We began walking in what I hoped was roughly the right direction, our footsteps crunching on the frozen ground, while the trees roared over our heads. After we had gone a few hundred yards I rang my phone, we stood and listened intently, nothing could be heard. ‘’Let’s carry on,’’ Tom suggested, ‘’we’re bound to hear it sooner or later.’’ Dialling the number again we ventured further into the darkening wood, our senses alert for any sound. Peering at my phone screen as we walked I suddenly felt his hand grip my arm, ‘’Listen’’ he said, and through the trees came the unmistakable shrill of a ringtone, I was jubilant, it had worked! 



Moving quickly, we soon came out into the small clearing where my phone rang loudly, still suspended in the bushes. We inspected the ground closely, nothing remarkable was visible, and the earth was as hard as steel. ‘’We have to try the ritual’’ said Tom, ‘’digging is out of the question’’. After composing himself he began reading from his notebook the short banishment ritual, which was in Latin, and of considerable age. I stood quietly by his side, silently praying that this ancient text would be effective. Reaching the end, he closed his book and we waited. A cold shiver ran through the forest as we stood beneath the howling canopy, something seemed to be building up, on an elemental level at least. After a few minutes had passed, Tom spoke, ‘‘let's go back Jim, we’ve done all we can.’’ On our return to the Hall the wind gradually eased and by the time we had reached the house the sun was shining brilliantly in a clear blue sky. 



Early on the next day we made an extensive tour of the estate, Tom had to leave before the Da Silva's return. I wouldn’t be able to explain his presence at the Hall without raising suspicion in their minds. The forecast was looking ominous again, snow and blustery winds were apparently heading our way, winter had not finished with us, yet it seemed. We walked along the entire forest boundary to where it finally ended at the Hall gates, nothing was seen or heard, only the temperature dropping was of note. ‘‘Has it worked?’’ I asked Tom point-blank as we stood smoking on the high road. ‘‘We’ll never know, will we?’’ he said, ‘‘all we could do has been done, let's hope it’s at an end.’’ By one o’clock Tom had gone, anxious to be home before the snow arrived once more, and promising to call me later. I was once again alone, and hoping to be away from the place soon. Being snowed in again, and this time with the Da Silva’s for company was a prospect I didn’t relish one bit. After checking that the house was in order, I made one final visit to the woodlands edge. 



All was quiet, but I didn’t like the feel of the place, it seemed different somehow, eerie and dark and something else bothered me that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Had we been successful? I wasn’t sure now, but I could do no more, and the Da Silva’s were due back later in the afternoon. At four, the couple arrived, along with a mountain of luggage and a harassed looking cab driver. They were much older than I had imagined, very grey and tired looking, worn out by life it seemed. We had a late supper together, and they were not very communicative. There was something about their manner I didn’t care for, nothing specific, just vague unease on my part. By ten, I was in bed, hoping that the heavy snow would hold off until after I was well away from this desolate place.

  
  


I stood on the house steps and bade farewell to the Da Silva's, they were subdued and reticent. An air of apprehension seemed to hang over them, as though their return was a duty, rather than genuine happiness to be home. I noticed them looking in an uneasy manner more than once at the sinister woods at the top of the parkland. Following their gaze, I saw, or so I thought, something in the gathering gloom, just at the forest's edge, vague and indistinct, like a desert mirage. Shaking off the notion with an effort, I picked up my bag and walked down to the car. The old couple seemed to almost sigh with relief, as though glad to see me go. 

  


Reaching the estate gates, I stopped and got out to take a last look at the Hall. It brooded there, austere and solemn under the darkening sky. A blustery wind was rising, and light snow began to swirl down from the dirty grey clouds overhead. A great forest surrounded the building on three sides, and covered many miles before finally thinning out at the foot of the high downland. Shivering as the snow fell thicker, I retreated to the vehicle for shelter. Putting the car in gear, I drove away from that haunted domain, where past wrongs, and shifting time and space coalesced uneasily with the concrete present. I was unsure of everything, and knew that I could never return. And slowly, Downview faded from view in the mirror.

It's like using Google when all I want is Perplexity,"**TL;DR:** Every trading platform has a million features but I just want to test if my simple idea works. Why is this so hard???

Ok this has been bothering me for months and I need to rant/see if anyone else feels this pain.

I have trading ideas. Simple ones. Like ""I think tech stocks bounce back stronger after earnings disappointments"" or ""oil prices seem to affect renewable energy stocks in weird ways."" Normal human observations that I want to test with actual data.

So I open up QuantConnect or TradingView or whatever platform everyone recommends. And I'm immediately hit with:

* 47 different chart types (WHO NEEDS 47??)
* Custom indicator builders
* Advanced portfolio optimization with 23 adjustable parameters
* Risk management dashboards that look like NASA control panels
* Live data feeds from 12 exchanges I've never heard of
* Paper trading simulators
* Social trading features??
* Monte Carlo simulations (I don't even know what this is)

It's like opening Google Search and being forced to use Advanced Boolean operators when I just want to know if it's raining outside.

**Here's what kills me:** Perplexity figured this out for search. You ask ""is coffee bad for you?"" and you get a straight answer with sources. No 15-tab configuration nightmare.

But trading platforms? Still stuck in 2015 apparently.

# The problems I face EVERY. SINGLE. TIME:

**1. The syntax hell** Want to test buying AAPL after 3 red days? Cool, first learn Pine Script. Or Python. Or their weird SQL-like query language. My simple idea is now a programming course.

**2. Analysis paralysis**  
I spend 2 hours setting up slippage models and commission structures. By the time I'm done I forgot what I wanted to test in the first place 😅

**3. Documentation rabbit holes** Every platform has 200-page manuals. YouTube tutorial series. Community forums with 10k posts. I just wanted to see if momentum works better on Fridays...

**4. Feature discovery nightmare** I KNOW the platform can do what I want. It's hidden somewhere behind Menu → Settings → Advanced → Custom → (???) → Oh there it is, under ""Miscellaneous Tools""

# What I actually want:

Me: ""Hey, I think bank stocks do well the week before Fed meetings. Is that true?""

Platform: *30 seconds later* ""Yep, 2.3% average outperformance, 68% win rate over 5 years. Want details?""

Me: ""Cool, what about tech stocks?""

Platform: ""Tech stocks actually underperform before Fed meetings. Here's why...""

**THAT'S IT.** No Pine Script. No parameter optimization. No feature discovery. Just: idea → test → result.

# The irony

These platforms are INCREDIBLE. They can do things that would make Goldman Sachs quants jealous. But it's like having a Formula 1 car when I just need to drive to Starbucks.

All this sophistication but I can't test a simple ""buy the dip"" strategy without feeling like I need a computer science degree.

Meanwhile I can vibe-code an entire web app by chatting with Claude, but testing ""do meme stocks follow Bitcoin?"" requires learning a whole new programming language? Make it make sense.

# What we actually need

Look, I've talked to dozens of traders about this. We all want the same thing:

1. Describe idea in normal human words
2. See if it works
3. Understand why
4. Maybe tweak and test again

That's literally it. We don't need 47 features. We need ONE feature that actually works the way humans think.

**The future should be conversational.** ChatGPT for trading strategies. Natural language in, backtest results out.

Because here's the thing - the best trading strategies in history were simple ideas, properly tested. Our tools should be simple too.

1mcbiuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mcbiuu/explore_best_coffee_machines_cuisinart_dcc1500tg/,Explore Best Coffee Machines Cuisinart DCC1500TG Worth It,"The Cuisinart DCC-1500TG has taken over my counter as my daily coffee companion, and I’ve got plenty of thoughts to share. As someone who relies heavily on a steady flow of caffeine, I need a machine that can keep up with my demands and still have the charm to sit pretty in my kitchen. This programmable 12-cup coffee maker promised a lot on paper, and after testing it extensively, I’ve dissected every drop it has to offer.

**Modern Design that Fits Just Right**  
The aesthetics of this coffeemaker steal attention right away, with its sleek black design and modern curves making it a perfect match for my minimalist kitchen. It’s compact enough to fit on my counter without stealing valuable space, yet spacious enough to brew a full 12-cup carafe. Measuring 7.75 inches deep, 10.5 inches wide, and standing 14.5 inches tall, it slots in neatly among my other appliances. The ergonomic carafe adds a functional beauty to the design, and the intuitive LCD clock adds a polished touch without overcomplicating things. 

**Programmable Simplicity for Every Schedule**  
Early mornings require no thinking, and this coffeemaker delivers in that department. The 24-hour programmable feature is a lifesaver, especially on hectic days. Scheduling my brew time the night before has become a ritual; waking up to the aroma of fresh coffee ready to pour is genuinely luxurious. The Brew Pause feature—what a gem! I’ve relied on it whenever my patience runs low, grabbing a quick cup mid-brew without any spills or messes. 

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1500TG price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0947bfpdx/)

**Performance Worth Savoring**  
If you’re wondering whether the coffee turns out any good, let me reassure you—it’s excellent. Using ground coffee, the machine efficiently brews a hot and flavorful cup every single time. Maintenance is straightforward too, thanks to the permanent nylon coffee filter and the charcoal water filter. Together, these ensure a clean, fresh taste, free from impurities. It’s fully automatic, and with its special descaling function, maintenance is intuitive. An LED indicator even lets me know when cleaning needs to be done. That’s one less chore for me to remember. 

**Highlights**  
- Fully automatic with customizable features.  
- Brew Pause function for impatient mornings.  
- 12-cup capacity, ideal for hosting guests or getting through long workdays.  

**Negatives to Keep in Mind**  
While this coffee maker checks many boxes, perfection isn’t the game here. For one, the buttons could feel more premium. They do their job, but they lack a tactile satisfaction that truly high-end appliances offer. Additionally, the 2-hour warming plate cutoff, while energy-efficient, might not be enough for anyone who enjoys sipping their coffee at a leisurely pace throughout the morning.

**Limitations**  
- Plastic buttons feel somewhat flimsy.  
- The warming plate could have a longer adjustable timeframe for extended use.  

**Competing Products in the Market**  
I compared the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG against a few peers, particularly the Breville Precision Brewer and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Breville is undeniably more advanced with its multiple brewing modes, but its steep learning curve and significantly higher price point left me favoring the straightforward functionality of this programmable coffee maker. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach model offers dual brewing (single-serve + carafe), but it falls behind in overall consistency and durability. Where this coffeemaker stands out is in its balance of simplicity, reliability, and modern design at a reasonable price.

**True Value for Coffee Enthusiasts**  
Expense is always a concern for kitchen gadgets, but this product delivers where it counts. It provides a true bang-for-the-buck experience by including so many customizable features, like programmable settings and built-in descaling alerts, in a user-friendly package. While it may not have the frills of more expensive models, it certainly doesn’t compromise on the essentials.

1mcbi2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMaine/comments/1mcbi2a/visiting_maine_late_october_early_november/,"Visiting Maine late October - Early November, looking for recommendations","Hi All! I’m a 30F and will be visiting Portland/Scarborough area late October - early November. I’ll be in the area for a total of 6 days. I’m coming solo and it’s my first time on the East Coast. Looking for recommendations for Must See’s/Do’s, shopping, food, basically everything lol. Also seeking tips for safe areas, areas to avoid, etc.

I enjoy sightseeing, coffee shops, boutiques, book stores (and places to read a good book), good food (where i can comfortably go alone), history/culture. i’m also open to doing just about anything.

I will have a rental car with me, and am happy to travel out of the direct Portland area up to 2-3 hours away.

Would also love some recommendations on clothing, I’m coming from Northern California so I’m relatively used to the cold during the winter months but I’m also assuming it’s a bit colder there in comparison. 

No real budget for this trip, but not trying to spend crazy amounts of money either.

Thanks in advance!

1mcbi1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1mcbi1p/i_took_a_job_to_fix_my_life_its_going_to_end_it/,I Took a Job to Fix My Life. It’s Going to End It Instead - Part 1 of the evergrove market series also found on r/nosleep,"My first shift at the Evergroove Market started with a paper sign:

""HIRING!! Night Shift Needed – Evergrove Market""

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind—bold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn’t out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every “We regret to inform you” that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I’d read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true—which usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I’d been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends—just me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn’t know my name. It wasn’t ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn’t anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I’d imagined.

“I don’t know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,” I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying “Evergroove” and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight—just a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you’re desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That’s when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

“What d’you want?” he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

“Uh… I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?”

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I’d said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

“Follow me,” he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. “Hope you’re not scared of staying alone.”

“I’ve done night shifts before.” I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn’t know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn’t have time to waste.

“This isn’t your average night shift,” he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn’t quite read. Like he was sizing me up… or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

“Fill this out,” he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. “If you’re good to start, the shift begins tonight.”

He paused—just long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn’t.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn’t want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can’t be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill—not from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn’t smile or nod welcomingly—just gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades.

“You’ll be alone most of the time,” he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. “Stock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.”

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times—no exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store—signals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

“Serious business,” I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. “What is this, a hazing ritual?”

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“If you want to live,” he said quietly, locking eyes with me, “then follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. “Your shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform’s in the back,” he added casually, as if he hadn’t just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly—10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn’t place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort—like armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn’t leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again—10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside—none of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was… strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans—but barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then—silence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath… then blinked back to life—dim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or… resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn’t know what I was waiting for—until I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren’t coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever—or whatever—it was, it wasn’t in a rush. And it wasn’t trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That’s when the footsteps—once slow and deliberate—broke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn’t think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace—anyplace—to hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now—pounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That’s how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed—my fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn’t dare turn on my phone’s light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I’d have to stay hidden. I didn’t even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must’ve dozed off—just for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

“Damn it,” I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store… I didn’t want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

“Is anyone there?”

A woman’s voice—gentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that’s when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands—gray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn’t smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt… wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

“Can I help you?” I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn’t answer.

Her smile twitched—just a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

“Yes,” she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

“I’m looking for something.”

I hesitated. “What… kind of something?”

She tilted her head—slowly, mechanically—like she wasn’t used to the weight of it.

“Do you guys have meat?” she asked.

The word hit harder than it should’ve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. “Meat?,” I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Just stared.

“Didn’t you get a new shipment tonight?” she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle—but in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store’s delivery crate…Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

“Yes,” I said, barely louder than a whisper. “You can find it in the back…in the frozen section.”

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn’t breathe… couldn’t breathe.

And then she said it.

“Thank you, Remi.”

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned—slow, mechanical—and began walking down the back hallway.

That’s when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren’t aligned with her body—angled just slightly toward the entrance, like she’d walked in backward… and never fixed it.

As she walked away—those misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum—I stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should’ve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly—no flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn’t want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I’d left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it—one of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that’s when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape—get out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn’t leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup—breathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that’s when I saw it.

In the mirror—wedged between the glass and the frame—was a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

“What the hell…” I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That’s when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes—steps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn’t have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that’s when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

“Let me out…”

Bang.

“Please!” another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming—screaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn’t exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again—harder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn’t a person.

It was a creature—crouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face…

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw—so wide I couldn’t tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn’t need eyes to know.

Then—

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store—shrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn’t even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

“Remi… in Aisle 6… report to the reception.”

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

“Remi in Aisle 6… come to the desk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

But my eyes—my traitorous eyes—drifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward—charging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn’t wait. I didn't think. Just thought, “Screw this,” and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws—reaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren’t far behind—hungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn’t see me.

It didn’t even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists—or claws—beating against the other side. Screams—inhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once—rose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever—maybe an hour, maybe more—while the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it—because I didn’t know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired—and too scared—to ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet—like nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

“You’re still here?” he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. “No shit, Sherlock.”

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. “Told you it wasn’t your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.”

“Not an average night shift doesn’t mean you die on the clock, old man,” I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. “You followed the rules. That’s the only reason you’re still breathing.”

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. “Can I quit?”

His eyes didn’t even flicker. “Nope. The contract says one year.”

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

“But,” he added, casually, “there’s a way out.”

I looked up slowly, wary.

“You can leave early,” he said, “if you get promoted.”

That word stopped me cold.

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

“Promotion?” I asked, carefully measuring the word.

“Not many make it that far,” he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn’t respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

“You earned it,” he said, standing. “Uniform rack’ll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.”

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we’d just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if “not many make it to the promotion,” that could only mean one thing.

Most don’t make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should’ve. I slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel—knuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I’d be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down…

Also changed all names for so people don't put it together. 

SO some context first My husband 35M was diagnosed with a mild form of autism when he was around 4 or 5 years old, he was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well. I 30F have sever anxiety and panic disorder, as well as depression. Now onto the reason im posting. Hubby and i have known each other since i was13 and he was 18 when he started working with my dad. Nothing even remotely romantic at the beginning of our friendship except for the small schoolgirl crush i had on him. i wasn't until around 2016 when he noticed something different and asked me out for the first time. At this time i said no as i just got out of a long relationship with someone who cheated on me. he asked me out 2 more time over the time and the 3rd time in 2018 i decided why not give it a go. We dated for about a year and he purposed and i said yes. we got married in 2021 and had our son in 2022. At first during our relationship, he was amazing treated me like a queen and told me i was beautiful every day.  It wasn't   till after i moved in with him in 2019 to a house his mom owns that things started to change. I noticed he drank a lot more then i had known. He would also get angry at the smallest thing some my fault some not. I had just chocked it up to his autism and we talked it through. Now im not going to lie i used to be a bit lazy and not do anything i own my shit but over time i got better and i have changed. Fast forward to 2021 we are married we have an amazing wedding and wedding night although it had to be moved from outside in a beautiful flower garden into the gardens pavilion because it was the first time we had a 100% chance of rain that i had ever seen and it was raining cats and dogs. but other than that, it was my perfect dream wedding. We started fight over a few things starting with my sister whom in my opinion did nothing wrong, but he took a few photos she posted the wrong way, and he started calling her names and saying he hated her.  Saying I'm inviting others into our marriage. He blamed me for not having a problem with her photos she posted. This was just after i had the baby. almost a year to the day after we got married my son's birthday is 5days before our Anniversary. After the baby was born the marriage went downhill. He started drinking even more getting mad at every little thing id do. i forgot to make his coffee i forgot to throw a wrapper away ect. His explosions started happing every night. He would bring things up that happened years before and hold them against me still does. At this point we get to my most recent birthday it was a big one i turned 30 My mom wants to talk to him i don't know why. so she does and he gets really mad my mom wanted to throw me a surprise party for my birthday. He doesn't want me to have a good 30th birthday as according to him i ruined his years ago. When he turned 30 i was sick so i would not kiss him we were freshly dating and i did not want to get him sick and i made him a cake but it was for my mom as well as i could only afford the ingredients for 1 at the time. There birthdays are 2 apart he said he wanted my 30th birthday to be as miserable as his. At the end of it i was so tired of fighting with him that i just told my mom to cancel th party. He did end up making me a nice dinner for my birthday, but he refused to kiss me until the next day. The fight now a days have gotten even worse he calls me every name in the book says he wishes we never got married hangs divorce over my head saying if i don't change im gone.  It has made me realize I am 100% reliant on him and i hate that. He like to say things like i get all as in school but i fail at home as a wife. His excuse im bipolar and autistic i can't control it that's just how it is. I know that is true, but he also can't use that as a excuse for treating me as a verbal punching bag. I also realized im not happy in my marriage anymore im not happy being his punching bag anymore. Here is my problem we do have our son together and i don't want to keep him from his kid because the one thing i can say is he's an amazing father. My son loves his daddy and his daddy loves him. If i do leave his father will not be happy, he will blow up and i dont know if i want him to be around him when that happens. 

So AITA

1mcbf93,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1mcbf93/what_the_actual_hell/,What the actual hell??,"My FA ex and I broke up 6 months ago, we were together a year and a half. He had been divorced for a year before I met him. For the first 6-8 months he was great; very loving, supportive, vulnerable, great communicator, put in lots of effort, very romantic, planned our dates and took care of me really well. At the 6-8 month mark into our relationship, he found out his ex wife had cheated on him during their marriage and he was never the same after that. He started becoming irritable, withdrawn and depressed. He told me he was lost and numb. I didn’t know what to do. I asked him twice to seek help and the first time he refused, the second time he said he would make an appointment but never did (I should have broken up with him then but I loved him so much and I thought he would change). He got a new job and several months after getting that job, he started going out with his coworkers more and more and I was never invited. We only saw each other Saturdays and Sundays bc of our work schedules but he started hanging out with his coworkers on Saturdays, so then sometimes I only saw him on Sundays. One incident in particular that really bothered me was when he went to a company Christmas party one Saturday night. Now, we had not seen each other all week. The next day, Sunday, he texts me and asked if I wanted to come over, I said yes. He then said “or you could stay home and I’ll stay home and we could chill separately.” I said “but then, it will be another week before I see you since I didn’t see you all last week and I don’t want to go 2 weeks w/o seeing you.” His response was “you’ve never gone 2 weeks without seeing someone to miss them on purpose?” I said “no, have you?” He said “yes ma’am, I think it’s perfectly healthy for partners to take time for themselves.” I thought that was the most bizarre thing ever. Fast forward to the breakup. He comes over to my house and says we need to talk. He sits down, bursts into tears, tells me that the trauma from his divorce is worse than he thought, everyday is a struggle and he’s so depressed. He said “I see the love you’re giving me and it’s beautiful but I can’t give you that same love in return, I don’t have the mental capacity to be in a relationship right now. You deserve better.” I said “why am I never enough??!! I’m so sick of it.” He said “no that’s the thing, you are enough!” He gave me a hug and left. A week later, I went to his parents house to drop off some of his stuff and his mom came outside. She gave me a hug and said she was so sorry. She told me, she met my ex for coffee the day before and that’s when he told her he broke up with me. She said “now don’t tell (my ex’s name) I told you this but…….he said you were so loving and supportive and mom, I think I made a mistake. It was the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in.” Like what??? That makes no sense. Oh and to top it off, 4 weeks after the breakup, my friend said she saw him on the dating apps. His mom also told me that  he got into therapy after we broke up. That really hurt me. Why wasn’t I enough for him to go to therapy? I feel like he’s going to meet someone else now and be healing for them. I’m so hurt and confused, nothing makes sense. I feel like he threw me out like garbage and that I didn’t matter, that our relationship didn’t matter. I haven’t heard from him since which I know is a good thing but still hurts.

Hey there 👋,

I’m a 23-year-old guy currently living in Bangalore and thought I’d give Reddit a shot to connect with someone new! I’m not here for anything weird—just open to meeting like-minded people for good conversations, a casual coffee, or maybe a walk around the city.

A little about me:

I work in the engineering/design field

Big fan of movies, long music sessions, exploring cafés, and walking aimlessly with good company

Prefer genuine conversations over small talk

Respectful, decent listener, and open-minded


If you're someone who enjoys laid-back chats, random topics, or just wants a chill meetup buddy—feel free to drop a message or comment below. Totally okay to keep things casual or just stick to online chatting too.

Looking forward to meeting someone cool. 😊",1,1753795471.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False

So on January 1st I arrived in Thailand and I started boxing. I went to church once in the 6 months up until my fight. Even though my Catholic faith had been growing stronger. For my fight I had to cut about 15 pounds to make weight. So the day before the fight I had been sweating trying to make weight. At first it was going well I had cut 10 pounds only 5 to go. Then I was over heating and even worse I wasn’t losing anymore weight. So I decided to walk home from my gym wearing a sauna suit, sweat pants, and a hoodie. I was very tired not haven eaten anything in 3 days. While I was walking I had my head down from being so tired and after about an hour I looked up and saw the church I had only been too once. I thought to myself that Jesus was with me wherever I am. After I suffered like I never suffered before, when you are that dehydrated you can’t sleep so I was tossing and turning all night contemplating quitting. Then at about 6 am I checked my weight and I was 2 pounds over, so I put on my sweats and hoodie and went for a walk. During this walk I had never been so tempted in my life. In Thailand every 20 to 30 steps is a drink station where they make sodas, coffees, and teas. The only thing that kept me going was disappointing God. I had cut the weight and went into weight ins.

It's incredibly peaceful, and it's making me feel a little better

But i still have that voice in the back of my mind telling me to drink. 

My dad (also an alcoholic) has never really liked me, but his visit the other week absolutely broke me. He took a road trip for the summer. He spent the whole day (yes, he was here for only one day) talking about how much he couldn't wait to get to his next destination- which is where his mentee ""Alan"" lives with his gf. He dipped out of my house at 5am so he could get on the road to see Alan- but refused to stay for 2 minutes so my husband could pee before he d said goodbye. But by the time Jim was fine peeing, dad was gone. When I thanked dad for coming, he said ""it wouldn't have been appropriate for me to come all the way out here without stopping to see you"". (I'm sorry, *appropriate?* are you f****** kidding me? How about just wanting to see your daughter?)

I get that he had more in common with Alan, they both are in the same niche scientific field and my dad taught him everything he knows. But I'm his actual child, and his firstborn at that. He could at least pretend to care about what is going on in my life. I've got some really exciting stuff happening professionally, and I didn't even get to tell dad about it. Because he was talking about how great Alan and his gf are he whole time. There's a lot more but this post is getting long. The tldr is it really sucks being the 4th favorite out of 2 kids.

My dad taught me to drink when things aren't going well. I'm a massive alcohol addict and it ruined my life for my entire 20s. I got sober at 30. My dad didn't seem to care about the fact that I had adverse health effects from drinking (like a fucking liver tumor) and chastised me for getting addicted to it. The hypocrisy was baffling.

At the end of the day, even though my dad doesn't care, I still want him to love me and be proud of me. And he just doesn't care. It hurts my heart, and the way I was taught to fix these problems is to drink about it. 

I've got 7.5 years sober, and there's no way I'm going to mess that up. But that doesn't mean it's easy, and it doesn't mean that I don't still have cravings. 

But I'm not gonna do it. I won't let alcohol win. I am stronger than that, and I have this community to help me move forward without drinking. Thank you all so much for being here. 

IWNDWYT.

Edit: 

Don't forget that you are stronger than your addiction. Some days we just want to say ""f  it"" but we ALL know what will happen if we go back. We will be in exactly the same spot we were when we quit the last time. This is an insidious addiction and it tricks us. Together, we are stronger.

1mcbaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1mcbaby/cutting_dairy_causing_insomnia/,Cutting dairy causing insomnia?,"I stopped eating dairy two weeks ago (used to have cream in coffee, Greek yogurt, cheese almost every day, not to mention more hidden sources like salad dressing) as part of an elimination diet to zero in on any allergies I might have, which I have always suspected (I always have mucus in my lungs, acne on my chin especially, keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs).

The results have been amazing, and though I have also temporarily cut eggs, shellfish, and nuts (except hazelnut), I very strongly suspect it’s the dairy. Within three days, the bloating I didn’t realize I had went *way* down and my pants and shirts were suddenly much looser without weight loss. In two weeks, I look *so* much less bloated all over. And my acne is going away, particularly the cystic acne on my chin, which has always been present since I was a teenager. My mood and outlook also seem much better, much steadier. 

However, shortly after I started, I noticed I haven’t been able to sleep well at all!! (Can’t fall asleep, can’t stay asleep.) Has anyone else experienced this? Does it go away? I’ve seen a lot of posts about sleeping better, but not about sleep worsening. I did have to make a point of getting enough protein and fat (and just calories in general), but am still having trouble almost two weeks later.

Honestly, the only thing that really stood out was the sambal kerang. That was deep, like someone in the kitchen still cared. Like it had a story of its own. That sambal slapped. I like it.

The rest? You’ve had better. I’ve had better. And for RM23, I wish I had spent it elsewhere.

I guess I’m chasing comfort in the wrong places lately. But sometimes you just need a plate of nasi lemak to remind you life’s bitter and sweet, and occasionally, just occasionally, spicy enough to make you feel again.

1mcb7lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1mcb7lq/a_shy_cat_is_teaching_me_what_it_means_to_trust/,A shy cat is teaching me what it means to trust,"Undoubtedly the longest lasting pain of my cPTSD has been my difficulty with trust. Being a survivor of CSA and adult SA taught me to see danger everywhere, to not put any trust in people beyond the bare minimum, to keep myself closed. I didn't want the trauma to happen again if I could help it. 

I'm currently house sitting for someone who has a timid but sweet cat. I've always loved cats, so I was excited to spend time with this little girl. Initially she kept her eyes on me - watching my every move and not keeping me out of her sight. She'd hide if I got too close, or tried to show affection. Slowly she tested her and my boundaries. She'd come for a closer look at me, before promptly hiding away again. She began to sit near the couch when I drank my coffee in the morning, and as I rested in the evening. Next, she moved to my side and accepting a few scratches behind the ears. She'd still hesitate, but she would lean in just a little, checking that I was still safe. Now, after a week, she's curled up with me in bed purring away in my arms.

Watching how she has slowly allowed me into her world has shown me what learning to trust others looks like. It's okay to be hesitant at first. I don't have to trust people blindly. After all, they could be an abuser, just like I could have been to her. But with gradual, protected and gentle interaction, I can lower my guard rails and trust that the other person is not out to hurt me. Trust can be revoked at any time, but it's possible to be vulnerable. Not everyone is a potential predator. There are people who genuinely do want to love me. ",10,1753795078.0,CPTSD,4,1.0,False

1mcb6qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mcb6qp/could_the_hamilton_beach_46899r_coffee_maker_be/,Could the Hamilton Beach 46899R Coffee Maker Be Your Perfect Drip Machine? Review Inside!,"Testing out the Hamilton Beach 46899R Programmable Coffee Maker was quite the treat, especially for an enthusiast like me who thrives on that fresh-brewed aroma every morning. Like most coffee lovers, I lean into convenience and a bit of versatility in my coffee machines. This device, with its sleek stainless steel design and programmable features, blended seamlessly into my routine. That said, there are some nuances worth considering before deciding if this is your next brewing companion.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the solid yet modern appeal of this coffee maker. The metallic exterior finish not only gives it a polished aesthetic but also makes it durable. It’s reasonably compact with dimensions of 11.26""D x 8.21""W x 14.61""H, meaning it doesn’t dominate my kitchen counter. The double-wall thermal carafe feels hefty but manageable, designed to keep coffee warm for hours without the need for a hot plate. That means no “burnt coffee” taste, something I’ve encountered in cheaper makers.

**Brewing Customization**  
One of the device's strong points is the ability to customize brew strength. Whether you prefer regular, bold, or robust, the Hamilton Beach coffee maker caters to your preferences. I’ve tried all three brew settings, and though I am partial to bold, I can confirm the flavor profiles shift noticeably between the options. It’s like having a barista shackled to my countertop. Plus, the cone brew basket optimizes extraction – you can taste the difference. The starter kit of #4 cone filters is a handy touch, especially if it’s your first foray into coffee making with cone filters.

[Check Hamilton Beach 46899R price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bwp6g1qp/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Even my technologically challenged uncle would find the Easy-Touch programming on this coffee maker straightforward. Setting it up to brew a fresh pot minutes before I wake up was a breeze. Imagine waking up to the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee... it’s honestly the kind of joy you need at 6:00 am to start your day right. Another practical feature is the auto shutoff. Trust me when I say, as someone who occasionally forgets to turn appliances off, this is a lifesaver.

**Hamilton Beach Perks**  
* Here are a few positive features that stood out:  
  - The double-wall thermal carafe effectively keeps coffee hot for hours.  
  - Brew strength options (regular, bold, robust) cater to diverse taste preferences.  
  - Auto-shutoff ensures safety and no wasted power.  
  - Cone filter basket allows for optimal coffee extraction.  

**Room for Improvement**  
While the coffee maker is packed with excellent features, a few weaknesses did surface:  
* The thermal carafe’s lid can be a bit tricky to clean and requires precise alignment to pour efficiently.  
* With its weight of 6.15 lbs, it feels bulky if you’re frequently moving appliances around.  
* Instead of reusables, it still relies on disposable paper filters, which might not appeal to the eco-conscious crowd.  

**Competing Brands**  
If I’m honest, the coffee machine competes well with others in the market like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and the Breville Precision Brewer. The major advantage Hamilton Beach offers is the thermal carafe at a more affordable price point. While Breville is undeniably superior for ultra-precise brewing control, their machines cost significantly more and might be overkill for daily, simple usage. Meanwhile, Cuisinart has a similarly sleek build and a reusable filter but lacks customizable brewing options which, in my opinion, limits its versatility compared to Hamilton Beach.

**Price Worthiness**  
Without quoting a specific price, I’d say this is a solid machine for its category. What stood out is the balance of advanced features like a programmable timer and brew strength options without charging a premium. Compared to alternatives with similar specs, the Hamilton Beach model edges ahead in cost-performance efficiency. It’s practical, functional, and certainly doesn’t feel like my wallet took a massive hit during the purchase.

1mcb68m,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mcb68m/the_brittle_world/,The Brittle World,"Fresh ground coffee on the supermarket shelves is a modern miracle, flown in from halfway across the world. We're told this is progress. The system behind it, ""just-in-time"" delivery, is designed for pure efficiency. It works by cutting out every backup plan and every safety net. Redundancy is waste. Waste kills profit.

The whole thing is built to be brittle.

A single ship gets stuck, a single port shuts down, and the miracle evaporates. That fragility is the deliberate price paid for efficiency. The shortages that follow are not a conspiracy in the traditional sense. They are the predictable cost of a system that gambles on stability to guarantee a good quarterly report.

This thinking has bled into everything. It's the blueprint for a quiet, pervasive form of social engineering that doesn't need a secret committee. It only needs the people in charge to share the same basic religion: self-interest.

It unfolds in three stages.

The systemic nudge. The fragile logic of the supply chain gets applied to society itself. Hospitals are run at full capacity, leaving them with no way to handle a crisis. Power grids are built for perfect weather, so they collapse in a real storm. Each decision is defended with a spreadsheet, but the cumulative result is a world waiting for a disaster.

This is made more potent by the ideological nudge. This stage makes sure you blame yourself when the system fails. We are constantly sold a story of radical individualism. So when food disappears from the shelves, the media blames ""panic buyers,"" not the supply chain. When hospitals are overwhelmed, the conversation is steered toward people's personal health choices, not years of underinvestment. If you can make people blame themselves and trust no one, they will never question the system that failed them.

And where would we be without the technological nudge. This automates the whole process and gives everyone plausible deniability. The algorithms that manage supply chains are called ""objective."" The code that feeds you outrage is just a neutral platform. These tools simply execute the profit-driven goals their creators gave them, allowing the architects to wash their hands of the outcome: ""The data made the decision, not us.""

But why? Why build a world so fragile? The simple answer is profit, and that’s true, but it’s not the whole story. The profit-driven fragility isn’t just an unfortunate side effect, it's a means to and end.

A feature that allows for a culling of the herd without anyone having to fire a shot. Every crisis, every system failure, washes away the vulnerable and the unprepared. It concentrates wealth and resources into fewer and fewer hands. For the survivors, the reward is a world with more room. Shorter lines at Disneyland. Less competition for everything.

More than that, it creates a compliant population. The ones who make it through are grateful, too scared of the next inevitable crisis to challenge the system that creates them. Docility becomes a survival trait.

Viewed this way, a direct and bloody ""Great Culling"" seems crude and unnecessary. Why risk a revolution when you can design a system that does the job for you, quietly and efficiently, crisis by crisis?

This isn't a secret plot that needs exposing. It’s a feature of our world, operating in plain sight. The most effective conspiracy is the one that has convinced you it doesn’t exist.",0,1753794987.0,conspiracy,4,0.43,False

As someone who has experimented with plant-based milk for years, I was curious to see how this sleek machine claimed to deliver creamy, barista-quality milk in just a few minutes. Using it daily for a week, I explored its features, performance, and quirks to get a full picture of this kitchen gadget. Spoiler alert—it's a solid performer, but there's room for critique.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
The first thing that struck me about this milk maker was its modern and compact design. It fits neatly on my countertop without eating up too much space, despite its 18 x 16 x 13-inch dimensions. The white plastic finish looks clean and minimalistic, blending effortlessly with my other kitchen appliances. The base feels sturdy, and while the machine is heavier than I'd expected at 22.7 pounds, that weight translates to stability during use. The included pitcher with a lid and a cleaning brush were thoughtful additions, adding more convenience to the package.  

[Want Nama MM100? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0dsykymft/)

**Innovative Technology at its Core**  
This kitchen tool leverages patent-pending technology that blends and strains in one container, an approach I’d never encountered before in a milk maker. The process of separating solids gently ensures you get smooth milk while leaving dry pulp behind, which I repurposed for baking muffins and energy balls. Not having to deal with messy pre-soaking or straining makes the entire process much quicker and a lot cleaner than traditional methods. It truly feels like the Nama MM100 emphasizes user convenience. However, keep in mind that the separation isn’t entirely foolproof, as I noticed some fine bits sneaking through when making grain milk.

**Ease of Use**  
The setup and daily operation are straightforward. Add your chosen nuts, seeds, or even oats, along with any sweeteners or flavorings you prefer. Just press a button and watch as the magic happens. With no soaking required, I simply poured in ingredients straight from the pantry, and within minutes, I had fresh, creamy milk ready for my morning latte. That being said, the manual could’ve been slightly more detailed—it took a bit of guesswork to figure out the ideal ingredient ratios to get my perfect consistency.  

**Positives**  
The strong points of this milk maker became apparent quickly:

- Simplified process with no pre-soaking or messy straining required.  
- Dry pulp output allows easy reuse in recipes, promoting zero waste.  
- Delivers creamy, barista-style milk suitable for coffee drinks.  
- Easy to clean design with the thoughtful inclusion of a cleaning brush.  

**Critiques**  
However, I did run into a few hurdles that potential buyers should note:

- The machine is bulkier and heavier than alternative milk makers.  
- Depending on the type of nuts or grains used, some fine pulp particles may seep into the milk.  
- Its price is on the higher side for occasional users, considering budget options available in the market.

**Competing Products**  
Looking at its competitors, particularly models like the Almond Cow and Nutramilk, there are some distinctions. For instance, the Almond Cow is lighter and similarly focuses on plant-based milk-making but requires pre-soaking, which is less convenient. Nutramilk, on the other hand, excels in versatility but can be overwhelming for those seeking simplicity and minimal cleanup. Where the Nama MM100 shines is in its clean milk separation process and ease of maintenance, which neither competitor handles as seamlessly. Still, if cost is a factor, some might gravitate towards more affordable alternatives.

**True Value**  
Considering its overall features and functionality, this milk maker offers solid value for plant-based enthusiasts who appreciate the convenience of a one-stop solution. While its higher-end price tag might deter some, the ability to control ingredients and eliminate store-bought milk with additives makes it a long-term quality investment. I would call this a financial win for households that regularly consume plant-based milk.

1mcb2o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mcb2o0/should_you_switch_to_the_best_laundry_detergent/,Should You Switch to the Best Laundry Detergent Pods Tide PODS,"Tide PODS Laundry Detergent Pacs, with their 3-in-1 functionality as a stain remover, odor fighter, and color protector, had been on my radar for a while. I finally caved and grabbed the 42-count pack in the Spring Meadow scent, curious to see how it would compare to my usual liquid detergents. With a household full of messy kids, a spouse who loves outdoor sports, and my own occasional coffee-spilling tendencies, I was ready to put these brightly colored detergent pods to the test.

**Convenience of Use**  
Laundry days just got a whole lot easier. These PODS simplify the cleaning process by bundling detergent, stain remover, and color protector into one compact package. No more guessing how much liquid to pour or measuring powder accurately! I simply tossed a pod into the drum before adding clothes, and it was good to go. The pre-measured nature of the pods is a game-changer for those of us who like things quick and hassle-free, especially on busy mornings.  

[Check Tide PODS Laundry Detergent Pacs price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0747yh7k9/)

**Cleaning Power That Doesn't Disappoint**  
Powerful doesn't even begin to describe how well these pods tackle stains. From the spaghetti sauce disaster on my kid's white shirt to the grass stains on my partner's running shorts, it handled everything like a pro. This is where the claimed ""3x more cleaning power"" compared to bargain liquid detergents becomes evident. Even in a cold wash cycle, the pod dissolves without leaving a sticky residue—a problem I’ve encountered with other pods in the past. My laundry came out looking spotless, and the Spring Meadow scent? Light and fresh without being overpowering.  

**Odor Control: A Fresh Perspective**  
The odor-fighting performance of these detergent pods was another highlight. Gym clothes that usually retain a trace of sweat even after washing finally smelled clean. I noticed a significant improvement in this area compared to my previous detergent. The scent lasted for days—every time I opened a drawer, it felt as though fresh flowers had bloomed inside.  

**Advantages**  
- Powerful 3-in-1 cleaning formula that includes detergent, stain remover, and color protector.  
- Dissolves completely, even in cold water, without leaving residue.  
- Spring Meadow scent is light yet long-lasting.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Not the best option for small loads, as the pods are designed for medium to large loads, meaning you're not able to adjust detergent amounts.  
- For heavily soiled laundry, I found I occasionally needed two pods for optimal results, which makes it less cost-efficient over time.  
- There’s always the slight risk of kids mistaking these colorful pods for candy, which means you have to store them securely.  

**Child Safety Packaging**  
Speaking of kids, I appreciated that the packaging has a child-resistant closure. While it’s not entirely foolproof (what determined toddler is ever stopped by packaging?), it’s still a thoughtful touch from the manufacturer. Like most parents, I immediately placed it on a high shelf out of reach, but for households without kids, this might not be as much of a concern.

**Competing Products**  
Tide PODS certainly faces tough competition from brands like Gain Flings and Persil Discs. Gain, with its equally delightful scent options, runs close but doesn't quite match the deep-cleaning efficiency of Tide's 3-in-1 formula. Persil’s pods excel at tackling tough stains like ink and grease; however, I’ve found Tide to be a more reliable everyday option due to its consistency. When compared to traditional liquid detergents, Tide PODS undoubtedly score higher for convenience and mess-free use, even if they’re priced slightly higher.

**Affordable Quality**  
While the upfront cost of these pods may seem higher than bargain detergents, you’re really paying for efficiency and effectiveness. Each dose packs more punch than cheap alternatives. Plus, the convenience factor of having pre-measured pods offsets the price premium. If you’re someone who values time and consistently great cleaning results, they’re worth considering. The ability to tackle stubborn stains and odors so effortlessly saves you from rewashing, ultimately making them a smart spending choice.

1mcaxgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mcaxgl/irregular_episodes_of_large_amounts_of_clear_urine/,irregular episodes of large amounts of clear urine,"Hi,

I (30yo male) have occasional episodes where my body seems to excrete 'large' amounts of corlorless urine. Usually I feel a bit thirsty and a bit tired afterwards. Some days I have a very normal pattern of urination, this happens maybe about one to three times a week.

In addition, I also have a bit of a small (overactive bladder), at 300ml the urge usually becomes quite intense. This combination interferes with my daily life quite a bit; long car rides usually feel a bit like Russian roulette :)

I can't seem to figure out what could cause this. I have had some medical tests done (glucose levels, ADH), but my GP says ""you probably drank too much the day before"". I am quite confident this is not the case; I don't drink abnormally much in the evening. My diet is relatively 'normal'; I eat my veggies, I mostly drink just water, sometimes I drink coffee and I drink maybe one or two diet cokes a week. 

An example is shown in the table below; on this day and the day before my drinking pattern was quite regular; about 9 glasses of 200ml water spread throughout the day, I did not drink coffee as I'm aware that can be a diuretic. I drank 500ml before 13.00. The day before I drank and peed about 1800ml. But still around 12.00 my body's urine production becomes almost 10 times as high as it is in the evening?

I am really curious if anyone has any idea what could cause or trigger this. Maybe someone has suffered from the same in the past and had any ideas of what could help?

Thanks!

I’m planning to open a coffee shop in Delhi targeting youth and professionals who want a calm, work-friendly space to enjoy great coffee. I have over 5 years of experience as a barista in Dubai, so I’m excited to bring my passion for quality coffee to Delhi’s vibrant scene! 😊 I’d love your insights to make this venture a success.




I’m looking for advice on:


1.  Best Locations: Which areas in Delhi (e.g., Connaught Place, Hauz Khas, Saket, etc.) would be ideal for a coffee shop catering to students and professionals? Any up-and-coming spots with good footfall and a vibe for laptop-friendly cafes?
2.  Current Coffee Shop Issues: What challenges are coffee shops in Delhi facing right now (e.g., high rents, competition, customer preferences, staffing)? How can I avoid common pitfalls, especially with my barista background?
3.  Tips for Success: Any suggestions for creating a cozy, productive space? What menu items, ambiance, or unique features do you love in Delhi’s coffee shops? How can I leverage my 5+ years of barista experience from Dubai to stand out?

1mcawvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mcawvs/should_you_buy_the_best_nugget_ice_maker_inoviva/,Should You Buy the Best Nugget Ice Maker Inoviva K2.0 or Not,"The INOVIVA K2.0 took a prime spot on my kitchen counter this past month, and let me tell you, I’ve been steadily churning out ice like some sort of countertop wizard. This nugget ice maker didn’t just catch my eye with its sleek black stainless design; it earned its keep by transforming my summer drinks into icy masterpieces. The chewable, perfectly-sized nuggets it produces are more than ice—they’re an experience. For someone like me who’s a fan of soft, crunch-worthy nuggets over hard cubes, it’s refreshing to finally meet an ice maker that gets it right. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Let’s break it down.

**Compact Design Without Compromise**  
In terms of design, this countertop nugget ice maker balances perfectly between aesthetics and functionality. Its sleek black stainless steel exterior gives a polished, modern look that complements most kitchens. Despite being compact—measuring just 14.9 x 9.25 x 11.8 inches—it doesn’t come off as overly delicate. I placed it between my coffee maker and toaster without feeling cramped for space. Plus, I appreciated the thoughtful addition of insulated walls, which seemed to keep the soft nuggets intact longer. Those Sunday brunches with family felt extra indulgent having this sitting proudly on the counter.

**High Ice Output That Keeps Up**  
One of the first things that stood out was how productive this little machine is. It delivers up to 40 pounds of nugget ice daily, and every time I threw a backyard party, this aspect proved invaluable. No one was left waiting for that perfect crunch in their cocktails. What truly shocked me was how fast it worked. The very first batch appeared after just 10 minutes of operation, a lifesaver for moments when I was running late prepping for guests. It made me wonder, how did I survive relying on freezer trays for ice before this?

**See INOVIVA K2.0 price on Amazon.**  

**Refreshing & Soft Nugget Ice: A Beverage Game-Changer**  
The magic of this machine lies in its ability to make soft, chewable ice that genuinely changes the drinking experience. My kids are now obsessed with it, declaring their lemonade tastes “extra fancy.” Unlike regular hard ice cubes that can dilute drinks too quickly, these nuggets retain a satisfying crunch while keeping beverages flavorful. My go-to evening drink, a classic iced coffee, felt elevated. The nuggets melt slowly, so I never ended up with a watered-down mess halfway through. It’s not just ice—it’s almost like putting a little luxury in every glass.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and stylish design fits almost anywhere.  
- Produces up to 40 pounds of nugget ice daily, perfect for parties.  
- Quick production rate; first ice batch ready in about 10 minutes.  
- Infrared sensor alerts for water fill or full ice basket.  

**Automatic Self-Cleaning, A Convenient Surprise**  
If there’s one thing that made my life undeniably easier, it’s this machine’s self-cleaning capability. I’m that person who procrastinates on appliance upkeep, but a simple three-second press of a button triggered a five-minute cleaning cycle. Knowing I don’t have to manually scrub its insides keeps me mentally at peace. Plus, no strange odors developed even during heavy usage.

**Limitations**  
- The machine isn’t silent—it produces a mild hum when running.  
- Works best when near a water source, as frequent manual refilling can be a hassle.  
- Ice sometimes clumps in the basket if not used promptly.  

**Other Options**  
In the world of nugget ice makers, there’s no shortage of competitors. I considered another machine that’s wildly popular for its similar 40lb production promise, but it was significantly bulkier. The quieter operation of that competitor was tempting, though, as the INOVIVA K2.0 is notably audible while running. Similarly, I looked into a more affordable basic version, but its lack of self-cleaning features was ultimately a dealbreaker. For me, the combination of compactness, self-cleaning, and nugget texture made this product an optimal middle ground compared to its rivals.

**Quality for Price**  
From someone who tests appliances regularly, I’d say it offers solid value for what it does. The key lies in whether you prioritize features like rapid ice production and luxury chewable ice over complete silence or a larger reservoir. While the price lands towards the higher side of countertop ice makers, its performance convinced me it was well worth the splurge. Appliances are investments, after all, and this one delivered the reliability I hoped for.

1mcavru,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mcavru/the_devils_vending_machine/,The Devil’s Vending Machine,"The vending machine wasn’t there yesterday.
Jim knew this gas station like the back of his hand—he had worked the night shift for the past twelve years. The place barely changed. The coffee was always burnt, the neon sign above the pumps flickered when it rained, and the same handful of late-night truckers and drunks wandered in every night.
But now, near the entrance, standing where there had only been an empty stretch of wall the night before, was a vending machine.
It was old—older than any machine Jim had ever seen, with a thick glass front that reflected the buzzing fluorescent lights overhead. The metal frame was rusted and blackened in places, and the keypad’s numbers were worn down to nubs. Inside, rows of snacks sat neatly in their coils, but he didn’t recognize a single one.
The wrappers were faded, some with names written in a language he didn’t understand. One bag, Grim Crunch, showed what looked like shriveled black chips with tiny faces frozen in silent screams. Another, Bleeder’s Gum, had a cartoon mouth chewing something red and glistening.
There were no prices. No labels. Just the snacks.
Jim took a step back. “What the hell…?”
The bell above the gas station door jingled.
Tony, a regular, trudged in, rubbing his red eyes. “Shitty night,” he muttered, making his way toward the coffee machine. “Took a wrong turn on the highway, ended up in some backwoods with no signal. Thought I was lost forever.” He scoffed. “Felt like I was in a horror movie.”
Jim barely heard him. His eyes were locked on the vending machine.
“You see this?” he asked.
Tony looked up, frowning. “Huh. That new?”
“No,” Jim said slowly. “At least… it wasn’t here last night.”
Tony scratched his stubbled chin, then shrugged. “Guess they finally got some new snacks in here. About time. You still got those stale-ass chips from 2015?”
Before Jim could warn him, Tony pulled a crumpled dollar from his pocket and fed it into the slot. The machine whirred. He pressed A5, and a bag of Night Bites tumbled to the bottom. The wrapper was completely black, the letters written in shaky white script.
Jim’s stomach twisted. “I wouldn’t—”
Too late. Tony ripped open the bag and popped one of the black, crumbly pieces into his mouth. He chewed slowly.
“Not bad,” he said. “Tastes kinda like beef jerky.”
He reached for another, but his hand stopped mid-air.
His eyes widened.
His jaw went slack.
Then he screamed.
Jim jumped back as Tony stumbled away from the vending machine, his hands clawing at his face.
“No! No, it’s not real!” Tony shrieked, slamming into a shelf of motor oil. Bottles crashed to the floor, dark liquid spilling like blood.
Jim grabbed his shoulders. “Tony! What the hell’s wrong?”
But Tony wasn’t listening. He was staring into the distance, eyes unfocused, his breath coming in ragged gasps.
“Where am I?” Tony whispered. His voice was small, childlike. “Oh God, no… I know this place. I know this—”
He started sobbing.
Jim felt ice crawl down his spine. “Tony, look at me. You’re in the gas station. You’re fine.”
Tony shook his head violently. “No, no, no. I’m back there. I can’t be back there.”
Jim followed his gaze to the glass doors.
Outside, the highway stretched on as it always did. The dim glow of streetlights, the endless dark beyond.
But Tony saw something else.
“I never made it out,” Tony whimpered. “I thought I did, but I never did. I died there.”
Jim stepped in front of him, trying to block whatever he was seeing. “Snap out of it, man!”
Tony’s breath hitched. He turned toward Jim slowly.
And then—
The lights in the gas station flickered.
A low, wet sound filled the air.
Jim’s stomach clenched. It was coming from Tony.
Tony let out a rattling gasp, and something moved beneath his skin.
Something was pushing against his cheek, stretching the flesh from the inside.
Jim stumbled back as a bulge crawled under the skin of Tony’s forehead, pressing outward like a hand trying to push through. His veins turned black, his pupils dilating until his eyes were nothing but pits.
“Jim…” Tony whispered, and his voice was layered. Echoing. More than one voice speaking at once.
Then his mouth stretched—wider, wider than a human mouth should go.
And something inside him laughed.
Jim bolted.
He grabbed his keys, ran for the door, shoved it open—
—only to stop dead in his tracks.
Outside, the world was wrong.
The highway was gone.
The gas station stood alone in an endless, swirling black void.
The stars overhead twisted and shifted like dying embers. The air was thick, suffocating.
Jim turned back to the vending machine.
The glass front was no longer empty.
Something inside the machine was watching him.
A dark, twisted figure pressed against the glass, its head tilting in a slow, unnatural way. Its mouth—wide and grinning—began to move.
No sound came out.
But Jim understood.
He turned to run, but the darkness swallowed him whole.
The vending machine flickered.
Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone.
And so was Jim.
One week later…
A new gas station employee stood behind the counter, bored, scrolling through his phone.
The bell above the door jingled.
A trucker walked in, yawning. “Man, I need a snack.”
His eyes landed on the vending machine near the door.
“Huh,” he muttered. “Didn’t see that there before.”
He stepped closer.
Rows of unfamiliar snacks sat behind the glass.
One of them caught his eye: Jim’s Jerked Meat.
The package showed a blurry image of a screaming man.
The trucker licked his lips and reached for his wallet.

Hello all. I’m a fellow 23 partner. Been with the company a long time. I’ve been a diabetic for much longer and I go to great lengths to care for my health. I recently developed high blood pressure and was forbidden coffee by my doctor which was devastating for me. Now I’m stuck with decaf pike or decaf espresso. I’ve had to start doing extra things to care for myself even more (I hit the gym now to work on my heart as safely as I can).

So management ment has been aware of my health issues that I have disclosed to them. It’s not become an issue that I can’t “taste” things like the pastries and sweet coffees. My manager is apparently going to have a conversation with me about it and I’m starting to feel discriminated against. Just had my supervisor tell me to try the new cold brew. I told her I’d try a modified version that’s more diabetic friendly with sugar free stuff. She told me “Well that’s now what we’re selling, you have to try it.” I told her “I will not be drinking something that’s harmful for my health” and she replied with “Well the manager will be having a conversation to you about it.”

I’m a SoCal partner and I feel this might become an HR issue since I know diabetes is a protected disability. This has never been an issue before and it’s never hindered me from providing customers with options on types of food or drinks since I go by what others describe and what’s given by the company. What else can I do to protect myself? I really can’t believe this is happening. Should I get a lawyer?",8,1753794208.0,starbucksbaristas,7,0.9,False

Strong flavors of earth and leather, secondary flavors of cocoa nibs and coffee grains, and a distinct lack of sweetness. I recently had the Dias de Gloria Brazil and wanted to compare, but though they are both made by AJ Fernandez, the differences are huge. I'll put this Trinidad on top.

I paired it with Santa Teresa Linaje, a medium range Venezuelan rum which I still can't get to liking, but that made the experience enjoyable by acting mostly as a palate cleanser. And sometimes that's what's best for such a strong cigar; something to clean the palate and prepare it for the next drag.

1mcau9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mcau9k/explore_best_wireless_earbuds_ordtop_i13_and_find/,Explore Best Wireless Earbuds Ordtop i13 and Find Out If They Deliver,"Testing out the Ordtop i13 wireless earbuds felt like stepping into a tech-forward, user-friendly audio experience. As someone who spends a lot of time listening to music, taking calls, and occasionally sweating it out in the gym, these earbuds seemed like a solid choice when I first got my hands on them. I'd heard a lot about the supposed benefits of Bluetooth 5.3 technology, ergonomic design, and water resistance, and these earbuds promised to deliver all that. Spoiler alert: they mostly succeeded, though some quirks did pop up along the way.

**Sleek Design and Comfort Level**  
One of the standout aspects of this product is its impressive lightweight build. Each earbud weighs just 3.8 grams, making them feel virtually weightless even after hours of use. The rose gold color added a nice aesthetic touch, giving it a modern sophistication that’s refreshing in a sea of standard black earbuds. Testing them during a run and a few high-intensity workouts was a breeze—these stayed secure thanks to their curved ear-canal design. However, I could see people with smaller ears needing a moment to adjust or experiment with the extra ear caps included in the box to get the perfect fit.

**Key Benefits**  
- Feather-light at only 3.8 grams for excellent portable comfort.  
- Unique curved shape designed to hug the ear canal for a secure fit.  
- IP7 waterproof rating allows worry-free use during sweaty workouts or light rain.  

**Sound Quality and Performance**  
Crucially, sound quality might be the most important consideration when choosing earbuds. I was particularly impressed with the bass, which felt punchy and immersive thanks to the 13mm dynamic driver. It adds depth to tracks where most budget earbuds tend to fall flat. Highs and mids came through nice and clear, and though these aren’t audiophile-grade, they really shine for casual listeners. Whether it was pop, rock, or even a bit of classical while working, the sound delivered consistently. The ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) microphones performed excellently in calls, especially during busy commutes or crowded coffee shop visits.

[Is Ordtop i13 calling your name? View Amazon pricing now.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0chybcpvm/)

**Battery Longevity and Charging Case**  
Battery life often determines how practical earbuds are, and the Ordtop i13 outperformed my expectations. I got close to the advertised eight hours of listening on a single charge, which is stellar compared to some of its competitors. The charging case, equipped with an LED power display, allowed me to check battery levels conveniently. It added an additional 32 hours of playback (bringing the total to a satisfying 40). USB-C charging is another plus here, ensuring a faster and more reliable charging process compared to its predecessors with micro-USB ports.

**Flaws**  
- Touch controls can be overly sensitive, responding even to accidental brushes.  
- Larger carrying case might not please those with space constraints.  

**Waterproof Ability for Active Users**  
Not all earbuds marketed as waterproof deliver what they promise, but the IP7 waterproof certification here is no gimmick. Whether it’s sweat pouring down during a spin class or a sudden drizzle during my morning jog, these earbuds held up exceptionally well. That said, while they resisted water perfectly, I made sure not to intentionally submerge them. 

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Ordtop i13 to other in-ear headphones in a similar price range, a few differences stand out. Models like the TOZO T10 offer a comparable waterproof rating but tend to be heavier and don’t have the same sleek in-ear ergonomic design. Meanwhile, higher-end competitors like Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro provide more advanced noise cancellation, though at nearly double the cost. What gives the Ordtop i13 an edge is its exceptional mix of affordability, dependable battery life, and surprisingly rich audio performance, which many pricier models fail to balance as elegantly.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering the features packed in—the advanced Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, ultra-lightweight design, waterproof durability, and a playback time that rivals some of the best in the industry—it’s hard to argue against the value this product offers. While it trades off a bit in advanced noise-cancellation and the size of the charging case, those willing to compromise slightly for affordability will find these a great pick.

1mcatuq,https://i.redd.it/xxn7fs9aatff1.jpeg,"Pairing Chronicles #205: In the strong, strong category","I had an Espiritu No. 2 yesterday. It certainly wasn't the first one, but while I've always found it a medium to strong cigar, yesterday it blew me away. Strong flavors of earth and leather, secondary flavors of cocoa nibs and coffee grains, and a distinct lack of sweetness. I recently had the Dias de Gloria Brazil and wanted to compare, but though they are both made by AJ Fernandez, the differences are huge. I'll put this Trinidad on top.

I paired it with Santa Teresa Linaje, a medium range Venezuelan rum which I still can't get to liking, but that made the experience enjoyable by acting mostly as a palate cleanser. And sometimes that's what's best for such a strong cigar; something to clean the palate and prepare it for the next drag.

1mcatfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mcatfa/can_the_breville_soft_top_pure_electric_kettle/,Can the Breville Soft Top Pure Electric Kettle Improve Your Morning Routine?,"Breville BKE700BSSUSC Soft Top Pure Kettle has been part of my daily kitchen routine for about a month now, and I’ve got plenty to share. This brushed stainless steel kettle doesn’t just look sleek but promises practical features that cater to ease of use and safety. Let me tell you how it holds up after daily testing, from boiling water for a single cup of tea to preparing hot beverages for the whole family.

**Design and Build**  
This electric kettle boasts a brushed stainless steel finish that immediately caught my eye. It’s elegant and fits seamlessly into my kitchen decor. What stood out was how lightweight it felt despite its sturdy build, weighing just under 3 pounds. With dimensions that don’t take up much counter space (6.1""L x 9.1""W x 9.6""H), it comfortably fits even in smaller kitchens. The dual water windows are an excellent touch, providing high visibility from either side, which helps when making just the right amount of tea or coffee.  

**Check [Breville BKE700BSSUSC](https://tastyshow.com/p/b06zzqmvbk/) price on Amazon.**

**Ease of Use and Ergonomics**  
This kettle excels in user-friendly functionality. The ergonomic handle turned out to be one of those underrated features I now can’t live without. It’s designed not only for comfort but also houses a lid-release button and an illuminated power switch right at your thumb’s reach. There’s no fumbling or awkward grip needed, which makes pouring boiled water a smooth and safe experience. Plus, the cordless design with a 360-degree swivel base ensures it can move from countertop to kitchen table without hassle.  

**Safety and the Soft Top Lid**  
The lid is where the real magic happens. This “Soft Top” lid gently releases steam while preventing splashes of boiling water. As someone who’s had more than my share of scalding accidents with other kettles, this feature felt like a lifesaver. Pouring water feels controlled and safe, making this kettle a great choice for anyone with children around or even for the accident-prone, like me. The push-button lid makes it easy to open without risking burns from residual steam.  

**Heating Performance**  
Honestly, this kettle performs beautifully at heating water quickly and evenly. With its 1500 watts of power and a capacity of 57 ounces, it handles both single-cup tasks and family-sized demands with equal efficiency. The illuminated power button doubles as a subtle indicator, so I always know when the kettle is on or off. It’s worth noting that heating times never dragged, even when filled to its maximum capacity; I never waited longer than a few minutes, and that’s saying a lot for an electric kettle.

**Positives**  
- Sleek and compact design, perfect for modern kitchens  
- Dual water windows for easy monitoring  
- Ergonomic handle with integrated control features  
- Soft Top lid minimizes steam burns and splashes  

**Flaws**  
- The stainless steel exterior, while stunning, can get quite warm after boiling  
- No temperature settings for specialty teas  

**Material Durability and Maintenance**  
To help it last, I’ve stuck with the hand-wash-only care instructions. The stainless steel finish, while fingerprint-prone, is relatively easy to clean with the right technique. The kettle’s interior also resists scaling quite effectively, at least so far. Its performance hasn’t diminished over time, which I attribute partly to its well-thought-out build and materials. That said, make sure you don’t submerge it in water while cleaning—the kettle is cord-free, but fully immersing base-connected components isn’t advisable.

**Competing Products**  
There are plenty of electric kettles out there, and I’ve tried a handful before, including models from Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach. While competitors offer similar features like automatic shutoff and boil-dry protection, very few manage to blend the soft-opening lid and ergonomic handle as effectively as this one. However, Cuisinart’s temperature-controlled kettles may be more appealing for tea enthusiasts who need precise water temperatures. Still, Breville focuses on safety and daily functionality, which edges it out for general-purpose users like me.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Breville Soft Top Pure strikes a good balance of performance and affordability. While it might not be the cheapest electric kettle available, the thoughtful features and reliable construction make it worth every penny. The safety-centered lid and cordless design make this a better investment for families or anyone prioritizing ease of use. If budget’s a concern, it’s helpful to compare prices on platforms like Amazon where competitive deals frequently emerge.

1mcar5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mcar5l/crawdads_pt_1/,"Crawdads, Pt. 1","My sister’s husband has always been a nervous guy. He’s usually the first to arrive and the first to leave at every single event, the kind you’d see glancing at every corner and peeking around every bend before he made any kind of decision. He’s quiet and rarely ever starts a conversation unless it’s something dire, never picks up a drink, never engages that much outside the few family gatherings we still throw. He had always been that way, at least for the several years that he has been in our lives. 

One of my defining memories of him happened when I accidentally spooked the couple while they were coming home from the movies one night. Neither he nor my sister had been prepared to see teenage me sitting alone and playing video games on the floor of the dark living room, and I swear the guy almost fainted when Leah hit the light switch and I caught them mid-kiss. His eyes were bulging and his skin was as white as a sheet. Leah didn’t let me hear the end of that particular faux pas for weeks afterward. 

My parents were always apprehensive of Markus and his skittish nature, but I never really had any negative feelings about the guy. He and Leah met in college and had basically been joined at the hip in all the decades since. He always said he had no family and thus spent all of the holidays with us, waving away any talk about his upbringing or where he was born, even though he would occasionally get a bit of a twang in his voice if he spoke for too long. As far as I was concerned his biggest sin was just being a little awkward. He made decent money as a remote marketing manager and he treated Leah very well, so there was never any real worry on my end. I gave him a smile and shook his hand whenever I saw him. Sometimes he would even return that smile. 

He didn’t seem to have any close friends beside my sister, and so when I got a text from him one night a couple weeks ago asking to hang out, I was kinda surprised. My sister was out for a work trip, so I figured maybe the guy wanted to grab a beer with my buddies and I. I offered some times at our local bar, and he seemed open to them. 

The day before we agreed to meet, Markus sent me another message with a stranger tone. “Can we meet alone at that time? Leah’s flight is delayed because of weather. I need to chat with you.”

I raised an eyebrow at that, unsure of what to even think. “Yeah man,” I replied back. “We can chat. Your place or mine?”

“My place.” He responded immediately. “Thank you.” 

I sent a rain check to my buddies for the next day and immediately texted Leah to get her input. She sent back a shrugging emoji with a short message. “IDK, but he’s been kinda jumpy lately, more than usual. He keeps telling me he’s fine, so I’m not pushing it. Maybe he just needs some guy time?” 

This didn’t exactly make me feel better. I had no idea what Markus wanted to chat with me about. For the rest of the day my mind ran through endless possibilities from ball cancer to winning the lottery, and none of them sounded like news that I should be the first to hear. If he needed dude time, I guessed that the idea of a crowded bar with my friends might have been too much. I hoped I was overthinking it and he was doing his best to socialize, as best as a guy like Markus could. 

After my shift that Friday I changed out of my work clothes and texted my brother-in-law about dinner. He offered to pay me back for picking up burgers, and so I arrived at his and Leah’s suburban ranch about an hour later with a bag of fried goodies. The snow was falling softly around us, not enough to stick, but enough to keep it blisteringly cold and wet. I didn’t know what to expect when I ducked my head through the weather and opened the couple’s front door, but it wasn’t what I saw when I did. 

Every single light in the house was on, from the porch lights to the foyer’s coat closet to the bulbs lining the stairwell. From where I stood in the entryway I could see directly into the living room, where my brother-in-law sat nearly motionless in a leather armchair across from the TV. Some basketball game was playing, but he wasn’t watching it. His eyes were directed to the corner of the room, unblinking and watery. 

When the front door closed behind me those eyes darted in my direction. His smile was thin and there was no color in his face. “Hey Shawn.”

His voice sounded hoarse from overuse. I nearly dropped the bag of food at the sound of it. “Jesus, Markus. You okay? What’s going on?”

He paused, as if he were truly thinking over my questions. “No.” He finally whispered. “No, I’m not.” I didn’t know what to say in return–still stunned by the sight before me. “Set the food in the kitchen please…I’ll eat in a second.” 

I gave him a single nod and quickly made my way over to their kitchen, which was connected to the living room. I placed the hamburger bag on the counter and glanced over my shoulder. I didn’t know why, but the sight of Markus following me with his eyes made my stomach drop. He stared directly at my face from his spot in the armchair, and I recognized that trademark worry he seemed to always have, but it was so much worse than any other time I’d seen him. The guy looked downright terrified. 

I walked slowly and took my seat across from him on the couch, his eyes never leaving my frame all the while. Any hope I had of having a chill evening with my brother-in-law now completely gone. “Markus…what’s happening? Are you sick? Do I need to call someone?” 

“No, no.” He waved one hand in the air, dismissing the offer. “I’m fine. I just…I just needed some time.” He stared back at the TV for a bit, seemingly in deep thought. We sat in silence for at least a full minute. I watched him with a growing sense of dread. 

When he burst out laughing a second later, I nearly jumped out of my skin. It was a full belly laugh, the kind you’d hear from a man at the highest point in his life. His hands gripped the edges of the armchair, digging into the leather as he rocked back and forth. I swear to God I could almost see tears forming in his eyes. I had to pull myself together before I spoke. “Markus, I’m going to call the cops if you don’t tell me what’s going on.” My threat wasn’t genuine, and my voice cracked when I spoke, but it was enough to get him to stop laughing. 

He stared at his feet for a second before mumbling. “Sorry, needed to get that out. I just…I just know you won’t believe me, Shawn.” A twang was beginning to creep into his voice. It was more upsetting than it should have been. 

Markus was always odd and easily spooked, but not like this. I was half-worried that he was going to admit to having killed a man, and I was not cut out for burying bodies. “What won’t I believe? You’re acting like you’ve had a psychotic break.” 

Markus shook his head profusely. “That’s the thing, man. I don’t know if I have, or if I did.” The bags under his eyes weren’t a good sign. “I never thought I’d tell anyone the truth…never thought I’d get to this point, certainly not after I got married, moved away…” He trailed off at the end of that thought, hands still gripping the arms of the chair, face still rigid with fear. “Sometimes you just don’t know what the truth is, you know what you know, what you’ve experienced, you know?”

I’ve never been a therapist in any sense, and my friends always said I was a terrible listener, but in that moment I felt as if I was staring down a man on the last legs of a breakdown. I could practically see the cogs in his brain fizzing and malfunctioning. The tension floating in the room was thick enough to choke on. Looking back, I probably should have called someone or at least looked up some therapy speak by then. I was so put off by his behavior that the possibility didn’t even enter my head. The mystery of it all clouded my judgment. 

If nothing else I thought that I was someone that could get him out of this strange funk–we were brothers after all. He had said he needed to chat, and so a chat was going to happen. “Tell me about it, man.” I spoke evenly and quietly. “Whatever you need to get off your chest, I’m here for you.”

Markus’s eyes searched my face, and I did my best to appear neutral and understanding, even though I was completely uncomfortable. Regardless of whether or not I was successful, he took a deep breath. “I’ve never told anyone this story.” He whispered. “I moved away from my small hometown the first chance I got, I got a degree, I was lucky enough to meet Leah, I’ve got this picture perfect life, I turned forty this year.” He chuckled darkly at the end of that list, but I did not know why. “It’s something I never thought I’d have to talk about ever again, but that’s the thing about some nightmares…they never really end. You don’t really wake up.” 

I took in everything he said and sat with it for several seconds before speaking. “You wanted to tell me a story?”

He nodded once. “I have to tell someone, Shawn. I thought that I could bury it, but I can’t do that anymore.” His tone was resolute, as serious as death. “I’m sorry, but I couldn’t tell Leah. She’s already half-convinced I’m a day away from the psych ward. She’s supportive, but…” His entire body shivered. “You’re the only other person I could think of.”

I bit down on my unease for a second–I had already made up my mind that Leah would be getting a call from me following this conversation, but I still nodded and gave him my own thin smile. “You didn’t kill someone, did you, Markus?” I’m not even sure if I was trying to make a joke, but the moment it passed my lips I knew it was the wrong thing to say.

Markus froze. Those fizzing cogs in his brain seemed to die completely for a moment. His lips opened, then closed, then opened again. “No…” He practically mouthed the word. “No, I…” He closed his arms around himself, as if protecting his stomach. When he spoke, his words were cold and direct. “Please. Just listen and don’t talk, okay?”

If I felt bad before, I was feeling terrible then. I was anxious and not in a particularly good mood to be hearing another man’s dark life story, but I figured in that same second that there wasn’t ever going to be a time when I’d be ready for something like that. 

I made a couple mistakes that night, but the smartest thing I did happened right there. While Markus was looking away, I started a video on my phone. It was sitting on the arm of the couch with the receiver pointed towards him. If anything went down…I might have something recorded.

I nodded. “Go on.”

Markus turned to the basketball game on the TV. The second half had just started, and it captured his gaze entirely as he began to speak:

“It was almost exactly thirty years ago. I was ten and I lived in a trailer at the edge of a farm. My grandparents owned the farmland and they let my mother rent the trailer we lived in. She was a single mother and they never approved of her, so they gave her the dregs of what they owned while she busted her ass at the 24/7 breakfast joint down the road. I grew up running in and out of their house and being resentful that my mother wasn’t around to play catch with me like Grandpa was.” He shook his head, groaning at the memory. 

“There was a forest down the hill we lived on, a scraggly patch of woods that nobody ever cleared out. We were so far out in the country. The air was muggy and all the trees sagged as a result. Miles away, the river and the lakes broke off into a small creek that ran from the base of the hill into the woods. Aside from that there wasn’t anything but fields. The school bus ride was a doozy–it always cut into the school day by an hour or two, just trying to get across all that farmland. My grandparents grew tobacco and made a decent profit while there was still decent profit to be made. They lived a median lifestyle, but it was flashy to everyone else in Ewing, where kids often came into school from the morning picking schedule with dirt on their palms. Grandpa and Grandma were saving up for my college, something that was unusual for anyone in the area. 

I shared a bunk bed with my mother in that godforsaken trailer and it was always too hot to sleep. I would sometimes sneak out to sleep with them and watch late-night specials in the main house, and Mama would always be upset in the morning.”

At that point in the story, I watched his bloodshot eyes begin to well. He blinked away the tears before speaking again. 

“My best friend was a boy named Ryder Poole. Across my grandparents’ house on the other side of the road was where the Pooles lived in their four-room house. His dad, Wyatt Poole, did business with my grandfather and his mother, Lissa Poole, helped cut tobacco when the tobacco was ready. Ryder was short, blonde, and kinda chubby, he was a year older than me but a foot shorter. He shared a bedroom with his younger brother Jed and sister Lily who were just as blonde and short as him. He and I would go off into the cornfields during the summers before school began and he would tell me about how daddy drank too much and hit him. His mother didn’t do a fucking thing about it, not that she could have, I guess. Ryder got it the worst because he was the oldest and the most likely to cause trouble.

I was too young. I knew how my grandfather yelled at my mother, and even my mother or grandmother would spank me in my worst moments. I would listen to Ryder and feel bad and in the next breath we would fight and wrestle like most boys. We would end our friendship over minor things and come back together not even a week later when one of us had a new toy or something we’d recovered in the lost-and-found bin at school. Sometimes Jed would hang out with us, but I remember that he was whiny and he cried a lot. Ryder was always in a bad mood when he was there. Lily was a toddler, and I never really saw her.

But when the weather was good and we weren’t fighting, Ryder and I would sit down by the creek bed and we would poke at little fish or throw rocks. It was so quiet down there, with only the sagging trees nearby and occasionally the sound of the birds on the wind. My mother always warned me never to go past the first tree into the woods, and we honored her for the most part. 

In the hottest months we even swam in the water, but none of our parents were too happy about that. One of the few spankings I ever received from my Grandma happened when I tracked mud over her kitchen floors after an afternoon spent splashing Ryder with creek water. It was so humid outside all the time–and the heat was intolerable even at night. Those were the nights I really upset my mother. I remember throwing full-body fits that I couldn’t sleep in the main house with Grandma and Grandpa’s air-conditioning.

It was during those days we would spend most of our time hunting crawdads. I think up north they’re just called crawfish or crayfish–can’t remember. They’re little crustaceans, and they’re mainly out during summer when the creek water is warm. They’re nocturnal, but if you knew where to look for them, and we did, you could poke some out during the day or early evening. Ryder and I were avid crawdad hunters–picking them from their hiding places to throw in a bucket for one of my Grandma’s legendary crawfish boils, ones that she would hold for the seasonal guys each summer. 

They always made these weird little clicking sounds, like crickets, hissing a bit whenever we yanked ‘em out of the water. They’re not venomous, but those pincers can be sharp enough to break skin. I had my toes pinched plenty of times, and it wasn’t the least bit fun. That added a bit of danger to the art that we very much enjoyed as boys. Those tasty little suckers were probably the only reason my mother tolerated us getting so close to that creek in the first place, and she never allowed us down there after dark.”

Markus paused. He leaned back against his chair, as if trying to steel himself by cramming his body into the leather. I had to lean forward just to hear what he was saying. His voice was barely a whisper. 

“I was ten, like I said. I remember that my mother and I spent half of my school’s fall break at a local hotel just to get away. She had saved enough money to treat me to a decent dinner and some time to ourselves. When we returned Grandma and Grandpa let us stay in the main house without so much as a word. I was stunned, but it felt like my vacation had extended. They bought me whatever I wanted for dinner and let me run around the house. We played games and watched movies late into the night. I thought a switch had flipped. It was only a few days after I returned to school that I realized Ryder hadn’t shown up with the rest of us.

I would ask my mother if Ryder could come over and she would turn away from me before saying that he was going to be out of town for a while. I would sit on the front porch of the main house and stare across the street to see when he would return, but I never saw a flash in any of the small windows of the Poole household. 

His dad’s rusted truck never came back to the driveway. I never saw Lily poke her head through the screen door or Jed playing with his cars on their rickety front porch. Thanksgiving came, then Christmas, and I didn’t see my best friend during that entire time. I don’t remember the smaller moments, but I do remember that at some point I stopped asking Mama when Ryder would be able to come over.

I was drinking apple juice next to Grandma and Grandpa at the kitchen table while we played cards on December 26th of that year. There was a call on the landline that my mother answered. I remember hearing a woman sobbing on the other end, her voice filled with so much anguish that it made every hair on my body stand up. My grandparents took us into the living room to finish our game, but I will never forget the sound of her voice…the sheer horror in her cries, the tears on my own mother’s face when she joined us. I didn’t ask her what that was. I never asked her. It was entirely incidental in my mind, I just thought it was strange.”

Markus could not stop the tears this time. His eyes were burned and painfully red, shot with tears as he continued to stare at the TV screen, entranced by the moving colors as his mouth continued to pour out words. I stood to hand him a tissue from a box on the coffee table. He took it, dabbing at his eyes as his expression crumpled for only a moment. His face straightened, but his eyes remained puffy and wet. 

“Markus, what–”

“Stop.” The bitterness in that one word stopped me dead in my tracks. “I said, you have to let me finish. Don’t talk.” 

My question vanished on the spot. I couldn’t even remember what I was about to ask. I only gave him a short nod to continue. 

He sniffled, wiping his face with the tissue before tossing it down on the carpet. “Christmas became New Year’s, and I returned to school in the winter knowing nothing about Ryder’s whereabouts. Their four room house on the other side of the road fell to waste and my Grandpa told me that they had moved away. I was angry because I thought my best friend had abandoned me without so much as a word. I relayed that same information to everyone else in my schoolroom who asked, telling every kid who brought up his name that he had blown me off completely. The teachers, who must have known, didn’t show it. They shushed us and told us not to speak ill of people who couldn’t defend themselves.

January became February and I had nearly put the whole ordeal on the back burner of my mind. Down in Ewing, we never got real winter, not like we do here, but that year gave us a miracle frost that nobody had seen in the county for at least a decade. The creek bed was frozen and the trees were dotted with ice for a good part of those months. I was thankful that our trailer finally wasn’t boiling hot, but it wasn’t very helpful for playing outside. Grandma took advantage of my days off school to get some help with chores in the main house. I was bored out of my mind. I remember…I remember that I wished something would happen.” 

Markus turned away from the TV, but he still wouldn’t look in my direction. The shakiness had started to affect his speech, and he stared at his feet as he cleared his throat. This set off a coughing fit, and it took him several more seconds to choke it away. 

“The night it all happened I was lying awake in the trailer on the bottom bunk. Mom was working a night shift at the diner. Grandma and Grandpa were asleep in the main house. I was wearing Mario pajama pants and an old elementary school t-shirt. I was having trouble sleeping and I didn’t know why. I had barely begun to doze off when I heard a knock. 

My eyes opened immediately. It was a hesitant kind of knock, and one I didn’t recognize. Mom had a loud knock whenever she forgot her keys in the trailer. Grandpa and Grandma’s knocks were sudden and short. I sat up in bed and looked towards the front door. ‘Mama?’ I called out, but nobody replied. 

The knock came again, but a little more insistent. After a few seconds, a chill ran down my spine when I realized where it was coming from. I turned around to see the trailer’s back window. I didn’t know what I expected to see, but it certainly wasn’t what was there.

Blinking in the darkness of the trailer, I felt my body grow cold as I saw the outline of Ryder’s face against the glass. One hand was pressed palm-forward on the window, and the other appeared behind his back. The window was low enough, but he still appeared to be stretching to reach its height, standing on his tip-toes in the cold grass. I blinked several more times, convinced that he was just an illusion. ‘Ryder?’

‘Hey Markus,’ He grinned. He had lost one of his front teeth during a school yard brawl some months ago, and he whistled the S in my name while he spoke. ‘Wanna go hunt for crawdads?’

I was happy to see him, but I was also confused and annoyed. ‘Where have you been?’ I asked, jumping up from the bunk and almost smacking my forehead on the wooden frame. ‘You moved away and didn’t even tell me you were going!’

Ryder’s smile disappeared. ‘Sorry–didn’t know I was leaving.’

I pressed my face up against the interior side of the glass, until I could see him eye-to-eye. He looked the same as ever from where I stood. ‘Coulda called.’ I grumbled. ‘Landline works just fine.’

He rolled his eyes. ‘My Mama doesn’t let us touch the phone, you know that. You were at my house when she yelled at me for prank-calling Mrs. Devers!’

That memory made me snort. ‘Yeah.’

‘So are you coming out or what?’ He pressed his other palm to the window, bouncing up and down as if he were still straining to stand tall. ‘The creek ain’t frozen anymore, and the crawdads are out. I miss your grandma’s stew.’

‘Wait, how did you get here?’ I blinked slowly, still shaking off my sleepiness. ‘Did your mama drive you?’

Ryder got a pained look on his face, but it was more irritation than anything else. ‘You keep askin’ these dumb questions. Mama hates driving. I walked here same as I always do.’

‘You didn’t move far, then?’

‘Nope, but that don’t mean it was easy.’ The grin returned. ‘Now do you wanna hunt crawdads or not?’

I remember standing there and weighing my options, as logically as a ten year old could manage in the dead of night with no sleep. My mother was still working the night shift, and my grandparents wouldn’t notice from their bedroom in the main house. I wasn’t too excited to leave my bed that late, but it wasn’t a school night, and I had been awfully bored these last several weeks. 

I was tired, I had missed my friend, and the idea of splashing around the creek that late was pretty tempting. Mama would never let us wander away from Grandpa’s property when it was this dark, but I figured the crawdads would probably be swarming. ‘Okay,’ I finally told Ryder. ‘But I’m gonna put my coat and boots on first, and you gotta tell me where you’ve been.’

Ryder’s grin widened, and he backed away from the window before vanishing around the side of the trailer.

TLDR: Gold 4 grand stands and yellow camping with a van was a perfect setup and recommended. We all had a ton of fun!

OVERALL

It was a ton of fun. It was amazing to see the cars. The Formula 2, 3 and Porsche series was also very fun to watch. The track and surrounding area was beautiful. We had a couple nice hikes around the track. Lots of great entertainment in the fanzone. F1 on TV misses a lot, seeing it live is incredible. So I highly recommend watching the race live at Spa.

GRAND STANDS

From Gold 4, you see the run out of turn 1 and the famous Eua Rouge/Raidisson complex. It's amazing to watch the cars there. It's a difficult area for the drivers, and you see a lot of cars loosing it there. Not so many passes though. Maybe some passes being completed at T1 from a distance. Another advantage of the grand stands is that you get a screen, so you can still enjoy the action on other parts of the track.

It's close to the fanzone, so it's great to enjoy all the other entertainment. Within the grand stands there are a lot facilities for toilets, beer, coffee and food. Then there are many more just outside.

An unexpected factor was the immediate community you build with your fellow grand stands people. That was a lot of fun!

Only change I would recommend was Gold 3, same location, but covered to avoid sun and rain. But we were prepared for the elements, so not a problem. 

CAMPING

We stayed in a camper van in the yellow camping. It was about a 30 minute walk. Overall, we were very satisfied.

We got the larger camping lots, plenty of space for outside eating, cooking and hanging out. We greatly appreciated that. So I recommended paying that extra for the comfort. The ground in this part of the world is uneven, so there was a slight slope. So bring blocks to level the vehicle. 

The camping facilities are basic. There are outhouses, they are fairly clean. There is a black water disposal facility. It also had fresh water. No grey water disposal. Problem was that people would make the mistake of using the freshwater hose to clean their toilet cassette. So there is a high risk of cross contamination. There are shower facilities, but you need a shuttle to access, so we used our camper. 

It's very close to Francorchamps. It's a small village, but there are many businesses catering to F1 fans. So restaurants, bars, sandwiches, bakeries, pharmaceutical, camping stores can be found there. We brought almost all our supplies, so didn't need these services so much. 

Prices are elevated (as expected), but still fair.

We did not bring our kids (boys weekend), but the race and camping is very family friendly. Plenty of kids having a lot of fun at the campsites.

MISCELLANEOUS 

After the race, the organizers give the access to the track. That was great to see it up close!

We were quite impressed at how well things were organized. However there are a couple hiccups. Crouds are big, so plan to arrive early to avoid queues. It's in a French speaking part of the world, so a bit of French can help navigating. But we still managed with English without problems.

There are plenty of excellent places to watch the race with Bronze tickets. But it's important to claim your spot early and then you are stuck there if you want to keep it. Grand stand seats are assigned, so we could come and go as we please.

You can bring sandwiches and water (in a plastic bottle) into the racetrack. So you can beat the lines and save money by having your own supplies. You cannot bring your own beer though (this is expected). 

Weather is highly variable, sun, clouds and rain, changing all the time. We were checking forecasts, but it's basically changing all the time, so only moderately helpful. So make sure you are prepared for rain and sun every day, no matter what.

We were very impressed by the F1 fan community. Everyone we met was super happy and excited to be there. They are all fans, so happy to talk F1. We didn't sense any hooligans, fans for opposing teams/drivers are very friendly with each other. There is plenty of passion at the same time. So it's a great atmosphere. There are people that were enjoying beer and partying, but it was all very happy and not excessive. Most people aren't drunk though. So it's not a boozy event. 

We rented our camper from Hamburg, imagining that we would have a road trip and see some cool places along the way. However, the traffic and construction on German roads, doubled our driving time. Plan for up to 10 hours travel (including breaks) if you come from Hamburg. I would recommend renting the camper from Brussels and flying instead.

In total, for tickets, camping, campervan rental, food, gas, beer, travel etc. we paid approximately 1600 euros per person. It's an awesome experience, we are still buzzing, so totally worth it.

I’ve been a diabetic for much longer and I go to great lengths to care for my health. I recently developed high blood pressure and was forbidden coffee by my doctor which was devastating for me. Now I’m stuck with decaf pike or decaf espresso. I’ve had to start doing extra things to care for myself even more (I hit the gym now to work on my heart as safely as I can).

So management ment has been aware of my health issues that I have disclosed to them. It’s not become an issue that I can’t “taste” things like the pastries and sweet coffees. My manager is apparently going to have a conversation with me about it and I’m starting to feel discriminated against. Just had my supervisor tell me to try the new cold brew. I told her I’d try a modified version that’s more diabetic friendly with sugar free stuff. She told me “Well that’s now what we’re selling, you have to try it.” I told her “I will not be drinking something that’s harmful for my health” and she replied with “Well the manager will be having a conversation to you about it.”

I’m a SoCal partner and I feel this might become an HR issue since I know diabetes is a protected disability. This has never been an issue before and it’s never hindered me from providing customers with options on types of food or drinks since I go by what others describe and what’s given by the company.

1mcaowc,https://v.redd.it/jy7qmlq19tff1,How Can You Improve Your Decision-Making Skills Under Pressure?,"Because “Panic and Hope” Isn’t a Strategy

📦 High-Level Framing

Decision-making under pressure is one of those crucibles that defines leaders, athletes, negotiators, and parents with toddlers. It’s not just about choosing the right thing—it’s about choosing it fast, with limited information, and while your heart rate spikes like a squirrel on espresso. Improving your decision-making skills under pressure is not just a life hack, it’s a life skill. In this post, we’ll look at how to stay calm, think clearly, and make smarter calls when the clock is ticking. Think Navy SEALs meet Google analysts—and no, the answer isn’t “just trust your gut.”

The Physiology of Pressure: Why Your Brain Short-Circuits

When you’re under pressure, your brain’s limbic system (hello, fight-or-flight) takes the wheel. The prefrontal cortex, which handles logical decision-making, starts to dim like a flashlight on its last battery. In short: stress hijacks your clarity.

The trick is to train your brain to stay online during stress. Here are a few tactics:

Controlled Breathing: Use the 4-7-8 technique—inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This literally brings oxygen to the decision-making parts of your brain and activates your parasympathetic nervous system.
Name the Pressure: Say it aloud or in your head. “I’m feeling overwhelmed by this deadline” or “My heart is racing because of this negotiation.” Labeling stress helps reduce its control by engaging your prefrontal cortex.
Pause Power: Count to three before responding to emails, questions, or demands. Even this micro-pause can shift your response from reactive to proactive.
Just like you wouldn’t expect a runner to sprint without warming up, you shouldn’t expect great decisions without mental prep.

When Good People Make Terrible Choices: Pressure’s Greatest Hits

Before we dive into solutions, let’s look at what happens when smart people crack under pressure. These failures aren’t character flaws—they’re predictable patterns we can learn from.

The Challenger Disaster (1986): NASA engineers knew the O-rings were compromised in cold weather, but pressure to launch overrode their technical judgment. The decision-makers focused on schedule pressure instead of safety data. Result: seven lives lost and a program in ruins.

The 2008 Financial Crisis: Lehman Brothers executives, facing mounting pressure, doubled down on risky mortgage investments instead of cutting losses. They confused activity with progress, making increasingly desperate moves rather than admitting the strategy was flawed.

Everyday Disasters: A startup CEO, pressured by investors, rushes a product launch without adequate testing—losing customer trust that took years to build. A parent, stressed by a toddler’s tantrum in public, yells and threatens instead of using proven de-escalation techniques they know work at home.

The pattern? Pressure makes us:

Ignore data that contradicts what we want to believe
Mistake urgency for importance
Revert to our worst habits instead of our best training
Focus on short-term relief over long-term consequences
Build a Decision-Making Framework Before the Fire Drill

High performers often use a personal framework to guide decisions quickly. Think of it as your mental “decision checklist.”

Try this 3-Step Mental Model:

What’s the goal? (Clarify the desired outcome)
What matters most? (Identify critical variables)
What’s the worst-case scenario? (Pre-mortem thinking)
When used regularly, this method becomes instinctual. You won’t need to conjure brilliance in the moment—you’ll just follow your training.

Real World Example: The Emergency Room Playbook

Consider an ER doctor: they make life-and-death decisions every minute, often with incomplete information and tons of pressure.

How do they do it?

Protocols: Standard operating procedures that reduce ambiguity
Triage: Prioritize what’s urgent vs. what’s important
Practice: Simulation training burns responses into muscle memory
The result? When chaos hits, they rely on muscle memory, not miracles.

You can do the same by rehearsing decision scenarios in advance: pitch meetings, job interviews, difficult conversations. The more you mentally “pre-play” them, the better you’ll perform when they actually happen.

Decision Hygiene: Daily Habits That Keep Your Mind Sharp

Think of decision hygiene like dental hygiene—small daily practices that prevent major problems down the road. Just as plaque buildup leads to cavities, poor decision habits compound into terrible choices when pressure hits. Good decision hygiene means maintaining the mental equivalent of clean teeth: sharp judgment, clear priorities, and cognitive reserves when you need them most.

Here’s your decision-making training plan:

Daily Reflection (5-minute post-mortem): Every evening, review three decisions you made that day. Ask: “What information did I use? What did I miss? What would I do differently?” Write down one insight. This builds pattern recognition for future high-pressure moments.
Low-Stakes Decision Sprints: Practice making small decisions in under 30 seconds—which coffee to order, which route to take home, what to wear. Set a timer and stick to it. This builds your “decision muscle” without consequences, so when stakes are high, speed feels natural.
Sleep & Nutrition Optimization: Get 7-8 hours of sleep and eat protein within 2 hours of waking. Tired and hungry brains make demonstrably worse decisions—one study showed judges were 40% more likely to deny parole before lunch than after.
Cognitive Load Management: Batch similar decisions (check email twice daily instead of constantly), use templates for recurring choices (meal planning, workout routines), and tackle your most important decision when your mental energy is highest (usually morning for most people).
Weekly Decision Detox: Pick one day where you eliminate unnecessary choices. Wear the same type of outfit, eat predetermined meals, follow a set routine. This gives your decision-making apparatus a break and prevents decision fatigue from accumulating.
These habits build mental resilience so that when the pressure’s on, you’re not starting from zero. You’re drawing from a well-maintained system.

Summary: Pressure-Proofing Your Mind

Improving decision-making under pressure isn’t about being a genius. It’s about building the right habits, training under simulated stress, and having frameworks that keep your brain online when it wants to shut down. Remember:

Pause to reset your physiology
Use decision frameworks like checklists
Rehearse tough scenarios mentally
Build good daily decision hygiene
The goal isn’t to make perfect decisions. It’s to make better-than-average decisions consistently, even when the heat is on.

🖐️QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding.

✨ Pressure Snapshot String

“What’s happening right now?” →

“What actually matters?” →

“What are my options?” →

“What’s the worst that can happen?” →

“What’s my next best move?”

Use this string to navigate meetings, negotiations, or personal crunch-time moments.

# Best copper Candle 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

The copper candle has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, becoming more than just a source of light and fragrance. It represents a blend of artisanal craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and a touch of luxury. With its warm, metallic glow and the rich patina that copper develops over time, it has captured the hearts of those seeking to elevate their home décor. For buyers looking to invest in a copper candle in 2025,understanding the key features,benefits,and available options is crucial. This guide will provide in-depth reviews and essential buying advice to ensure you select the perfect copper candle for your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The defining characteristic of a copper candle lies in its vessel, Typically crafted from pure copper or a copper alloy, it offers superior heat conductivity and durability compared to traditional glass or ceramic containers.

**Material and Construction:** Copper candles generally feature a seamless or carefully joined copper container that houses the wax and wick. The quality of the copper, its thickness, and the method of construction greatly influence the candle's longevity and aesthetic appeal. Higher-end candles often boast hand-hammered or spun copper, adding a unique artisanal touch. The interior lining is also important, often featuring a food-grade sealant to protect the wax and prevent corrosion.

**Wax Composition:** The type of wax used in a copper candle impacts its burn time, scent throw, and overall environmental impact. Common options include soy wax, beeswax, and paraffin wax. Soy wax is a popular choice for its natural origins, clean burn, and ability to hold fragrance well. Beeswax offers a naturally sweet aroma and a longer burn time due to its higher melting point. Paraffin wax, while less expensive, can release possibly harmful chemicals during combustion.

**Wick Type and Size:** The wick plays a pivotal role in the candle's performance. Common types include cotton wicks, wood wicks, and paper wicks. The size and number of wicks affect the burn pool, scent diffusion, and likelihood of tunneling (where the wax burns unevenly, leaving residue on the sides of the container).Multi-wick candles are frequently enough used in larger copper vessels to ensure an even and complete burn.

**Scent Profile and Intensity:** The fragrance of a copper candle is a crucial aspect of the overall experience. Top-tier candles utilize high-quality essential oils or fragrance oils to create complex and long-lasting scents. The intensity of the scent should be well-balanced – strong enough to fill a room without being overpowering. Popular scent profiles include floral, woody, citrus, and spicy notes, often combined to evoke specific moods or memories.

**Lid and Packaging Design:** Many copper candles come with a matching copper lid to extinguish the flame and protect the wax from dust and debris. The lid also helps to preserve the candle's fragrance when not in use. The packaging design is also important, reflecting the candle's premium nature and ensuring its safe delivery. high-quality packaging often includes recyclable materials and thoughtful details that enhance the unboxing experience.

Key features of the best copper candles include:

 high-Quality Copper Vessel
 Natural Wax Composition
 Optimized Wick System
 Exquisite fragrance Blends

## Core Benefits

Copper candles offer a range of benefits that extend beyond simply providing light and fragrance. Their unique characteristics make them a desirable addition to any home.

**aesthetic Enhancement:** The warm, metallic sheen of copper adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to any room. Whether it's a minimalist modern space or a cozy traditional setting, a copper candle can seamlessly integrate and enhance the overall décor. The natural patina that copper develops over time further adds to its charm, creating a unique and ever-evolving piece of art.

**Enhanced Fragrance Diffusion:** Copper's excellent heat conductivity ensures the wax melts evenly and consistently, releasing the fragrance efficiently. This leads to a stronger and more consistent scent throw compared to candles in less conductive materials. The result is a more immersive and enjoyable sensory experience,filling the room with a delightful aroma.

**Extended Burn Time:** Due to the heat-conducting properties of copper,the wax melts more uniformly,minimizing waste and maximizing the candle's burn time. This ensures a long-lasting fragrance and a greater value for your investment. Proper wick trimming and maintenance further extend the burn time.

**Enduring and Eco-Kind:** When paired with natural waxes like soy or beeswax, copper candles can be a more sustainable and eco-friendly choice compared to those made with paraffin wax and disposable glass containers. The copper vessel can be reused for other purposes once the candle has burned fully, further reducing waste. Many brands also offer refill options, allowing you to replenish the candle without discarding the copper container.

**Unique Gifting Option:** A copper candle serves as a thoughtful and memorable gift for any occasion. Its luxurious appearance,enticing fragrance,and long-lasting quality make it a gift that will be appreciated and enjoyed for a long time. It's an excellent choice for housewarmings, birthdays, holidays, or any other special event.

I just find it really weird that I have to find out he's out having coffee or bowling with his friends after looking at his stories when my last msg is not even seen or replied to.
And everytime I've asked him why he does this, his response is the same, ""babe I don't even use my phone like that outside, I only take a snap and put it on my story or just save it and keep my phone aside. I don't text you cause I wanna talk to you when I'm not bothered by things or when I'm all by myself"" ""if you have such problems with my stories I'll just delete them"". And he deletes the stories everytime, and my response is the same EVERY DAMN TIME, that I don't have an issue with you uploading stories, my issue is you not telling, and me having to find out thru your stories while my msgs sit unseen.
He's a good guy otherwise, but this thing really bothers me, more so now cause I've asked him to not do this particular thing and he still does it.
How does one navigate through this?

[Lelit Mara X],"Hi everyone, I am new to the world of manual machines and I have a potential problem with my espresso extraction. I use a Lelit Mara X machine with Eureka Mignon Facile grinder. No matter what adjustments I make, I always end with a puddle of water on top of my coffee puck after extraction. I use a basket of IMS 14-18g in which I made several attempts between 15g and 18g and I always have this result. I get a beautiful espresso with ration 1:2-2.5 in 25-30 seconds, at ±9 bars, and the taste is good! Is it normal to have this residual water every time? No channeling during extraction.

After that he went silent and deleted his profile without letting me know. Hence, I wrote him a letter and put it in his mailbox.

After several days he texted me, saying that he’s seeing someone (that didn’t work out in the end) but would down to meet for coffee. He rescheduled and we ended up watching movie at his place (we have been flirt texting before we met and he mentioned that the first time is just purely fuck and he didn’t get to know me).

So we ended up watching movie and fuck. I asked for another meeting up before leaving the country and we have had a coffee date. After the coffee we been to a walk and we walked back to his place (he’d asked me if I wanna go upstairs). We cuddle for a bit and I have to leave. Before leaving I told him how I feel (that I have never want someone, but would like to try things with him), he said that he doesn’t believe love at first sight and tend to know the person before going into a relationship.

And since that he has become less responsive and eventually telling me:

Hey! Sorry Ive been away for a few days.

Hope you’re having a great long weekend :)

I think at this stage I’m not really looking for anything. Just trying to focus on family, work and my current friendships. I think I’m just not in a state atm to explore things further with you. You’re very sweet though and I wish you all the best xx

And I wrote him something stupid and he didn’t reply. Since that I have gone silent for about 3 months and recently texted him trying to reconnect.

“Hey Micheal, hope you’ve been well and everything’s been going smoothly. Just thought I’d check in and see how you are doing :)”

But he didn’t reply. Would there still be a chance for me with him? I really like to explore things with him. Please help! Thanks!",1,1753793149.0,gayrelationships,1,1.0,False

1mcag26,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mcag26/unsent_letter_from_the_desk_of_professor_g/,Unsent letter from the desk of Professor G.,"I write these words with the almost total certainty that i won't be alive when you will read them. Indeed, i am afraid i won't be allowed to even complete this report before They decide to silence me permanently. It is only through an act of clemency on Their part that I have been allowed to return to my home and I fear They will one day regret Their decision and drag me back to their island, or to another remote location outside the borders of our civilized world. If I am fortunate enough, I will have the time to put an end to my life before They get to me- even then,  am not yet certain death is an insurmountable barrier for Them.

My story begins in a summer during my childhood years- I cannot be sure, but I estimate it to be when I was about four or five years of age. My father, always a distant, barely present figure in my life, came to me around the beginning of the summer season and told me I would soon be leaving for a trip. My thoughts at the time, I remember distinctly, were of fear at the idea of leaving my parents for what seemed like a long time. I protested, and when that failed, cried, pouted and used all the arsenal that my young self had at his disposal to convince the grown-ups; nothing worked. On the day of the Summer Solstice I was dressed in my finest clothes, handed my luggage and entrusted to a severe-looking woman along with about a half dozen other children. We were told we would travel a short distance by train, then a long distance by boat before reaching our summer resort. My parents, along with the parents of the other children, waved to us from the platform. As you might imagine, I was devastated at the idea of abandoning them for such a long duration, but I vividly remember they weren't sad at all; my father was, at most, slightly worried, and my mother looked almost entranced. The mental picture of her vacant smile on that day still haunts me, for it was the same smile she wore everyday in the final three years of her life, after she fell into the coma that she would never emerge from.

Of the trip on the train I don't remember much. I do distinctly remember getting into several fights with the other kids, and how the teacher, whose name I can't remember, would always be breaking us up and attempting to impose some discipline. Since, however,  she never administered any from of punishment, we were back to our horseplay the second her back was turned.

After a few hours on that train, we were marched to the pier where we waited for the steamboat that would take us to our final destination. Several more children joined us from other trains and coaches, along with others, older kids and adolescents, both males and females. We were divided along age lines and were not allowed to talk to the older kids.

As the ship arrived, we were ordered to board, always divided by age. As my group was getting on board I turned back. I clearly remember seeing the teachers helping a kid off one of the coaches. I don't remember the child's appearance clearly, but I do know that the moment I saw him I was assailed by a sudden fright and I had to turn away, as though my young mind could not process what I had just seen.

And this is the point where my memories of that summer conclude, for my very next memory is of returning to my home to meet an ecstatic mother and father and realizing that it was just about time to return to school. Whatever had transpired on the island was forgotten and I had no interest in finding out, just like my parents had no intention of explaining it.

You may wonder why I have never, until very recently, thought of investigating this lapse in memory. The fact is, it seemed perfectly natural for me to have this, and later more lapses in memory. It seemed to all fit together. In fact, it disturbed me to even think that I was supposed to remember more than what I did.

My life proceeded normally. As the only child and heir of my father's fortune I was schooled in the best institutions and taught from a young age the principles of mathematics, economy, diplomacy and all subjects that would help me in the world of business. My education seemed to attribute secondary importance to literary and artistic subjects, but I took advantage of every chance to learn more about authors and artists of the past. I was particularly entranced by the history of ancient Greece, Sparta above all. Their brutal discipline and their war-like nature were what inspired me above all to compete and succeed.

I was a rather violent child. I very often fought in pointless skirmishes with my fellow students and sometimes with street thugs or our servants. I was entirely unwilling to let a transgression against me go unpunished, and I often walked back home with a black eye or a limp. Punishment for these actions was generally mild; I always felt my father was wholly agreeable with my way of solving such disputes. In fact, our relationship only seemed to improve every time I returned home fresh from a brawl.

The summer trips to the island, during my formative years, continued. I cannot clearly remember how many times I have been there during my youth. It may have been as few as three times - one at five, one at ten and the last at fifteen- or it could have been as often as every summer. My memory is, sadly, unhelpful in this regard, and I don't think anyone else who is alive today would be capable or willing to give me a clear answer.

The trip I took at the age of ten I remember rather clearly. The train, and, I am quite sure, the boat, were the theater of countless skirmishes between me and the other boys. By then I was rather accustomed to fighting and won most of the brawls, something that earned me a position of respect among my peers. I made a few friends, even though it was clear to me that most of the boys were rather uninteresting sorts. I learned that many of them came from the richest and most influential families in America. I won't mention the names, but they are those that first come to mind when one thinks of opulence and power; empires to put my family's fortune to shame.

It is worth noting that the travel took somewhere between two and five days.  I could never recall the correct number, and it's indeed possible that different trips took different times, despite being between the same start and destination. During this time we were free to do as we pleased, as long as we kept to our section of the ship - once again, we were divided by age. The personnel made sure we ate our meals and we weren't hurt but they were otherwise rather stand-offish and returned to their quarters as soon as their job was completed.

We each had an individual room. They were all identical, small but well-kept. The furniture was constructed in the practical, unsophisticated style of the cheapest steamboats. In retrospect, I realize that this clashed with the general opulence of the guests; these accommodations were far beneath what my family could afford, to say nothing of my even richer peers.

As I said, I was rather bored with the company, therefore I spent most of my time exploring the ship. Animated by the same hatred for rules as any boy my age, I made a few attempts to break, or at least peek into the other sections of the ship, but to no avail. The vessel was, so to speak, airtight. The doors were always locked and the portholes sealed. The crew, as I said, left us to our own devices most of the time, but quickly intervened whenever someone attempted to breach their tightly enforced security.  As you can imagine, this only served to excite my young mind even further, for whatever could be so secret as to require these tight security measures had to be the most interesting and forbidden secret.

Despite the initial failures of my explorations, around what had to be the second day of the trip I took at the age of ten, I did notice something that piqued my interest. While I was sneaking around the doors to the crew's quarters I came across a bedroom which seemed similar but bigger than mine. Curious as to who could warrant such an accommodation, larger even than those reserved for the wealthiest of guests, I tried to peek though the keyhole. What I saw made me recoil. It was, I was certain, the same creature I had seen when I was five, and what is more, there were two of them.

They were about the same height as me, although it was hard to tell seeing as they were seated, and they looked humanoid enough to pass for children, provided one did not look at their faces. The two were identical, and in fact it was only by their clothes that I guessed one was a boy and the other a girl.  Those faces- I dread to even describe them, and I assure you that however monstrous my writing might make them seem, to see them with your own eyes would be an entirely more horrifying experience. Their skin was grayish and wrinkled, their eyes large, expressionless orbs, almost fish-like in their vacuousness. Their nose was absent, replaced by two slits like those of of snakes. However, their deformation was only a fragment of what filled my young self with sudden, animalistic terror. They had a certain *otherness,* an alien quality that is hard to describe, almost of vertigo, as though looking at something completely out of perspective.

I suddenly realized that they had noticed me, as the door was opened inward and they both turned towards me. I had no idea *how* precisely the door had been opened, as they were both sitting at the other end of the room and neither could get up: I noticed, now that had a clear view, that both of them were in wheelchairs and had their legs amputated below the knee.

I was too afraid to even move. Their eyes fixed on me while I struggled not to look at those inhuman faces again.

Then they spoke. Their voices were perfectly normal, a stark contrast to their appearance. They introduced themselves as Bradley and Melanie, and when they told me their last name, I was again amazed at having heard the name of one of the richest, if not the richest family in United States. I wondered how it could be possible that nobody had ever found out that the children of someone so rich and famous were such abominations; my understanding was that such a birth would have had journalists all over the country fighting to be the first to publish their picture.

As they spoke, I finally brought myself to raise my eyes and look at them again. The feeling of vertigo resurfaced even stronger than before. The way they spoke was utterly *wrong.* Even though their mouths moved as to form normal syllables, the sound coming out seemed to be *different.* The only way I could find to explain this would be that it was as though the voice came from a phonograph recording while they attempted to match with the movement of their lips the words spoken, never quite succeeding. Their voices were entirely identical and they often finished each others' sentences, to the point that I had the impression they were speaking as though they were a single person.

Still terrified by their grotesque appearance, I tried to reassure myself that I was in no danger; they couldn't even get off their chairs, let alone hurt me. But of course, I couldn't react. I assure you, the sight of those creatures would have frightened the bravest of veterans, so you might imagine what effect it had on a poor ten year-old boy.  I must have remained there, transfixed, staring at the floor for a full minute. Then one of them commanded me to look up. I obeyed immediately, completely devoid of any will to oppose or even run away. I found myself looking at their inexpressive eyes again, and again, I was gripped by vertigo. I recalled to me all the strength of will I could muster, and with unsure and shivering voice, I brought myself to ask them the first thing I could think of, that is,  why it was that they traveled in a double room, while everyone else was alone. Why such a triviality was the first thing in my mind I don't know- perhaps I saw it as being something innocuous enough to be able to discuss it with them as I would have were I speaking to normal children.

They explained, still speaking in their unsettling manner, that they never must be separated. Furthermore, they both needed to be close to the infirmary, since their health was, in their own words, a little shaky. They didn't elaborate further- instead, they asked me about my family. They seemed oddly friendly, so much so, in fact, that I was somewhat feeling more at ease than before

We talked for a while. They certainly seemed more interesting than the others, although I don't remember clearly what we said to each other. I do remember, however, that after I boasted that nobody on the ship could beat me in a fight, they laughed and said they could beat me easily. They didn't explain how, but I had a distinct feeling that it was true. I wasn't going to test this however- I had no intention to come any closer to those children, let alone touch them.

 As we spoke, I noticed a droplet of blood forming around the nostril of the male twin, Bradley. The sight was, as you can imagine, unpleasant. He continued with the conversation as the red fluid ran further down the creases and wrinkles of his face down to his nigh-nonexistent upper lip. My dread, having been somewhat suppressed during the conversation, resurfaced in full force. His nostril had the appearance of a deep open wound, oozing blood which disgustingly bubbled with every breath. Less than a minute after the bleeding had started, two nurses walked in and, without a word, wheeled the twins out. They waved me good bye and I returned to my room, where I spent the rest of the trip, still uneasy from the conversation.

I visited the island again in the following years. I still retain murky memories of a short-lived romance with a girl my age when I was fifteen. Her name or face I cannot remember; our relationship began and died on that ship.

That was, I am sure, the last visit to the island during my formative years. My life then proceeded normally, with no further lapses of memory. I continued my studies, eventually majoring in Classic Literature against my father's desire and securing a position in the university as a lecturer and later a professor. When I was thirty-three years old, my mother first began to show the signs of her mental illness. Her behavior grew ever more melancholy, often ignoring our attempts to distract her or answering them with muttered gibberish. Several doctors were hired, but no-one succeeded in curing or even clearly diagnosing her illness. Their hypotheses collectively ranged wildly across the spectrum of modern psychoanalysis, as did the proposed cures include everything from hypnosis to violent electroshock.  Eventually, she fell into a deep coma, and she spent her last years staring into nothingness, a vacant, stupefied smile on her face. After three years in this miserable state, she passed away.

In the months following her death, my father and I grew closer, after my refusal to follow in his footsteps had pushed us apart. A little over three years later, my father passed on as well, leaving me to inherit his industries.

 Until the day of my fortieth birthday, it never occurred to me to think of what had transpired on the island. My life had been quiet and satisfactory. I had a prestigious position, many friends in the academic community and I had inherited my father's large fortune, which, while it had dwindled in the later years, still was more than sufficient to afford me a luxurious lifestyle.

Then, my nightmares started.

At first, they were nothing but shapeless terror, forcing me to wake up in the middle of the night drenched in cold sweat . As the days passed, the monstrosities which populated them started to take a clearer form. I remembered seeing the twins I had met as a child. I remembered the sight of sinking ships, torn apart by what seemed to be titanic, inhuman hands. Glimpses of the island, a monstrosity of dark, greenish stone cut in dizzying geometric patterns. I remembered fighting with my bare hands against arthropod beasts which defied all principles of nature. Every time, the nightmare was a little clearer, and every time a little more terrifying. I became an insomniac. As my work was beginning to suffer, I took a leave of absence. My colleagues suggested me to see a psychiatrist, but i refused. I have to admit I had a certain irrational contempt for their whole category, since I blamed the science of psychiatry for its failure in treating my mother. I now realize that wasn't much of a failure on their part, as much as the total inadequacy of human science to explain the phenomena caused by Them.

So I was left alone to divine the reason and explanation for my dreams. I spent what had to be several days neither asleep nor awake, in a perpetual fugue where any attempt to sleep was met with sudden, overwhelming terror and any attempt to stay awake lasted a few minutes at most.

While I was in this painful, confused state, the memories of the travels toward the island which I have relied here began to resurface, but they were too chaotic and fragmented for me to truly understand them.

Gathering my will and with the aid of dangerous amounts of coffee, I made an effort to type everything that came to my mind on paper as soon as I could, since the memories often appeared suddenly and even more suddenly disappeared. After a few days of concerted effort, I collated the first version of my memories.

You might suggest at this point that I might have suffered from a form of psychosis and my recollections were, in fact, hallucinations and false memories which I had, in my delirious state, intermixed with childhood memories. This realization hit me just as well. Had I chosen to trust the counsel of my friends over my irrational hatred for the sciences of the human mind, what followed could probably have been avoided. I would have relied my case to a psychiatrist of some sort, who would have dismissed my experiences as delusions and probably administered enough drugs or electricity to force me into a blissful stupor. God help me, a lobotomy would be a more merciful fate than knowing what I have discovered.

However, my stubborn conviction prevailed. I realized that I could not find peace until I had confirmed or dispelled the truth of those disturbing visions.

Animated by a new surge of energy and relieved somewhat after I had committed my terror to the paper, I directed my investigation towards Bradley and Melanie, the two monstrous twins.  They were members of a family which I knew very well, one which owned a financial empire of enormous proportions. A company which, I realized, I could contact at any time.

At first, I investigated about who the current owner of the company was. The answer which I found immediately was what I simultaneously hoped and feared. Bradley was indeed in charge of the company since his father's death. Both he and his sister lived a secluded lifestyle, attributed to their poor health. This was about all I could gather from the newspapers which mentioned them; it seemed journalists had little to no interest in the lives of someone who was so influential in the country's economy. There was no mention anywhere of their place of residence, of their relationship to any other important businessmen or, of course, their appearance. I concluded they were bribing the newspapers to keep their lives a secret and decided that I had learned all I could about these two from the press.

My next step was trying to get in touch with the twins. I decided to use the fact that I was still technically the owner of a large industry to schedule some kind of business meeting.

I attempted various times to contact them, but the secretaries and administrators I spoke to were remiss to let me talk to them. The most I could get out of them was that either because of their health or some business trip out of the country they couldn't be reached. After several days of attempts I gave up on this lead.

I fell once again in the same malaise that had grasped me before. My search seemed destined to lead nowhere and my memories were becoming increasingly blurred. The nightmares afforded me no peace. Inside that abhorrent, unearthly island, I sat along with the other children, in classrooms hewn from the green stone, on angular benches as we listened to lectures from creatures which only superficially resembled humans. We would wander halls cut with disturbing precision into the rock and sleep on slabs of a material that resembled coral, wood and flesh all at once. A frequent nightmare involved fighting an army of monstrous creatures. Their appearance was initially that of hulking insectoids or decapods, disgustingly crawling towards me, emitting unearthly sounds as they flailed their antennae. To my horror, the ones farther away crawled over the others to reach me, as though their entire host was a tide of chitin and legs. As I struck them, their shells shattered, splashing brownish blood on me and on the other nearby creatures. The still-writhing broken segments of their bodies fell to the ground, being immediately trampled by the others. While I attempted to push back the enormous oozing mass of creatures, I realized with shock that the ones that had broken down under my blows were somehow reforming themselves. The broken pieces of their bodies reattached one to another as though they were lumps of clay being pushed together. Most of them were attached at random to one another, generating even more abhorrent monsters with dozens of legs disposed in insane, incoherent patterns. Most horrifying of all, some had no legs at all but they still attempted to drag themselves along with their antennae or with worm-like motions of their disgusting bodies. The dream dragged on as the creatures savaged me again and again until I, too became a part of that roiling mass of aberrations.

Eventually, I could pull myself awake, only to feel weak and nauseous, barely able to move. With each subsequent night, the dream became clearer and more vivid. Even when I was awake, the sting of those creatures' poison tormented me. I often looked down to my chest expecting to see those unnatural, over-sized insect feelers brushing over my skin.

It was around the middle of June that, in one of the brief moments of lucidity my condition afforded me, I realized that in only a few days, the Summer Solstice would come, and another ship would leave the harbor to head for the Island.

At once, my path was clear before me. I had to find a way aboard that ship.

I set out to my goal with the desperate determination of one who had nothing to lose. The very same day I purchased a ticket on the first train leaving for he seaside town the ship used to leave from. I remembered it as a small but rather rich community; thriving fishing and shipping industries sustained a lively town. However, when I returned, the place had fallen into poverty and abandon; empty houses were strewn about unkempt roads. It did not matter to me. I made my way to the port authority offices to consult the naval records corresponding to the date of summer solstice of the previous years,  going as far back as the years I had been ferried across. Not one ship that fit the description of the one I was taken on could be found.

I wandered across the docks for days, spending my nights in a cheap hotel I found near the port. The line between day and night, as well as that between wake and sleep were increasingly blurred with each passing day. I don't recall details of what I saw, aside from gray, dirt and squalor. Rows of derelict, wooden storehouses flanked ruined roads. Few ships even passed through there, mercantile vessels as well as fishing ships. I had not truly slept in at least a week. Reality appeared blurry, sickening, painful even. I walked as though wading through knee-high water. The few locals I met were, when seen through my delirious state, unpleasant, sickly apparitions drifting in and out of my field of vision.

Eventually, the Solstice came.  With it, the ship I remembered from my childhood appeared at the docks. I remember walking towards it, in stupor.

For reasons I dread to even imagine, the sailors guarding the ship moved aside as I approached. I was allowed on board.  As I walked up familiar stairs and across familiar corridor, my feeling of nausea gradually disappeared. I walked now more securely, with an unexplained sense of purpose. I remembered those stairs, for I had walked them many times before. I remembered that ship, that relic of times gone by. To my disgust and relief, I felt at home.

And then I turned around and saw the most beautiful thing I had ever experienced- my teenage lover, who had not, apparently aged so much as a single day in so many years. She still radiated the beauty and confidence that had drawn me to her when I was fifteen. But then I saw who was holding her hand – there was no mistaking.

That fifteen year-old boy was me.

My memory, once again, fell apart, drowned into madness. All I recall is that, by some cruel mercy, I was allowed to return.

I have no desire to investigate the matter further. I have purchased a revolver, and I fully intend to use it should They attempt to contact me again. Five shots for them, and the last one for myself.

If you do receive this letter, and if you believe that what I saw was real, I beg you to do all you can to bring light to these events.

In the end, after i returned, after i made my preprations and sat down to write this missive, a nagging thought has been assailing me, one that might drive me to put a bullet through my skull regardless of outside circumstances.

First thanks for all the feedback on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/1m5dkb9/i_feel_stuck_in_france_and_im_thinking_about_the/), you guys convinced me of my next move !

I’m a Frenchy coming to the Bay Area for two months around **mid of October**, aiming to **build my business faster, think bigger, and connect with the right people**.

**I’d love advice on**:

* Best **city or neighborhood** to stay in (startup-friendly, not too $$$ if possible)
* **Meetups, events, or spaces** where I can connect with builders, UX/UI people, hardware nerds, or early-stage VCs
* People I **absolutely need to meet** from product-minded founders to creative technologists

**Budget** is pretty “budgetty” since I’m bootstrapping this stay to test the waters and prepare the ground for a bigger push in 2025. So I’m open to creative or cheap housing solutions (sublets? couchsurfing with cool devs? 😂)

🙏 Any guidance, tips, intros, or pointers are *so* appreciated. And if you’re into haptics, XR, or generative tools we should grab a coffee.

## Key Features Analysis

The variety of wicker coffee tables on the market can be overwhelming. Understanding the key features will help you narrow down your choices and find the ideal piece for your needs.**Material Quality:** Wicker is a general term referring to any woven material. The most common materials used for wicker coffee tables are natural rattan, synthetic resin (also known as all-weather wicker), and seagrass. Natural rattan offers a classic look and feel but requires more maintenance and is best suited for indoor use. Synthetic resin wicker is highly durable,weather-resistant,and ideal for outdoor use. Seagrass is a natural and sustainable option that offers a unique texture but is less durable than rattan or resin.

**Frame Construction:** The frame of a wicker coffee table provides the structural support. Common frame materials include aluminum,steel,and wood. Aluminum frames are lightweight, rust-resistant, and excellent for outdoor use. Steel frames are strong and durable but can be susceptible to rust if not properly treated. Wood frames offer a warm aesthetic but require sealing and weatherproofing for outdoor applications.The quality and construction of the frame considerably impact the table's stability and longevity.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of a wicker coffee table determines how much weight it can safely support. This is an crucial consideration if you plan to use the table for placing heavy items, such as books, plants, or serving trays. Weight capacities typically range from 50 to 150 pounds. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure the table meets your needs. Exceeding the weight capacity can damage the table and compromise its stability.

**Weave Pattern and Design:** Wicker coffee tables come in various weave patterns and designs, influencing the overall aesthetic and visual appeal. Common weave patterns include tight weaves, open weaves, and decorative weaves.Tight weaves offer a smooth and uniform surface, while open weaves create a more airy and relaxed look.Decorative weaves incorporate intricate patterns and textures, adding visual interest. The design of the table, including its shape, size, and leg style, should complement your existing furniture and décor.

**Finish and Color Options:** The finish and color of a wicker coffee table can significantly impact its overall style and suitability for your space. Natural rattan tables often feature a clear or stained finish to enhance their natural wood tones.Synthetic resin wicker tables are available in a wide range of colors,from classic browns and blacks to vibrant blues and greens. Choose a finish and color that complements your existing furniture and décor to create a cohesive and visually appealing look.

**Tabletop Material:** The tabletop material adds to the coffee table's design and function. Common options include glass,wood,and wicker.A glass tabletop is easy to clean and offers a modern look. A wooden top provides a warm and natural feel. A wicker top continues the woven aesthetic,but might not be as easy to clean or offer a perfectly flat surface. consider what you will use the coffee table for when selecting the tabletop material.

1mca4ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mca4ju/the_home_i_dropped_out_of_college_to_work_at_an/,"The Home (I dropped out of college to work at an Old-Folks Home, and now I can't sleep at night.)","This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.  Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn’t own a lot, and anyway, I wasn’t coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of *Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn’t like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn’t. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn’t bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn’t been updated since the 80’s, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn’t too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA’s, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident’s beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly. 

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I’ve never told anyone:

I’m terrified of old people.

I don’t know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it’s just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn’t bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading *Salem’s Lot* by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn’t need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA’s, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn’t want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch *Supernatural.* Sometimes we’d shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched *Nosferatu* at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria’s are garbage, but the Home’s food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA’s and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn’t for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don’t exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they’d quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn’t complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing *Elden Ring* and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn’t have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn’t mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn’t want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn’t looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my *Beserk* brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn’t know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into *Beserk* too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. “For shift exchanges,” she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying “sure.” I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn’t have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we’d play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn’t have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I’d ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn’t really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA’s hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn’t talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn’t really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn’t want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn’t have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That’s when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won’t go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don’t know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena’s phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena’s name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn’t respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she’d ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn’t risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn’t hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

“Get up. Get over it. You have a life to live,” she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn’t a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena’s apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn’t bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn’t want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn’t true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don’t think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a “Lena” living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I *knew* I wasn’t crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn’t said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn’t know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn’t sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for: 

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn’t a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly’s for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn’t do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss’s office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home’s records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.  I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss’s door was locked.

It wasn’t.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA’s about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly’s screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read “archived footage”. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said “Footage moved to Secondary Storage.”

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren’t allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn’t closed the camera window.

She didn’t look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

“I always forget the damn spoon.”

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA’s in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn’t familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren’t usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that  I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss’s keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn’t even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet’s handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn’t recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.  I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don’t know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn’t care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn’t say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn’t go home. I didn’t trust my apartment was safe. 

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS’s and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled “Lena” and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly’s room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn’t remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn’t turn. It didn’t look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena’s neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly’s arms began to expand and contort. Lena’s body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly’s fingers and into her body. 

Lena’s body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly’s arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena’s mouth was open in a scream I couldn’t hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly’s hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly’s form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn’t look away. I hated it, but I couldn’t stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word “Evidence” written on it.

I was a coward. I should’ve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should’ve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I’ve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don’t require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don’t ask questions.

But I know now I haven’t run far enough. For the past month, I’ve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don’t know how much longer I can last.

There’s a reason I haven’t said the location of the Home, or even which state it’s in.

I can’t remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can’t even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there’s a blank space where it should be.

I can’t find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I’m going crazy.

But I know it’s real. I can’t forget what I’ve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it’s only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can’t say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It’s like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

1mca3fy,https://i.redd.it/svqklf4g4tff1.png,What to Eat When You’re Not Hungry Staying Nourished During Strong Appetite Suppression on Weight Loss Medication,"
One of the most notable effects during a weight loss journey supported by weight loss medication is appetite suppression. For many individuals, this reduced hunger is initially welcomed. However, it can quickly raise important questions about how to stay properly nourished, especially when you simply do not feel like eating.

While the goal of weight loss medication is to support reduced calorie intake, consistently undereating or skipping meals entirely can lead to unintended consequences — including fatigue, nutrient deficiency, muscle loss, or difficulty concentrating.

This guide outlines why regular eating remains essential, and provides practical suggestions for what to eat when your appetite is low, all within the context of a balanced weight loss journey.

The Role of Nourishment During Appetite Suppression
Even when hunger is diminished, your body still has fundamental nutritional requirements. These include:

Protein, to support muscle mass, immune function, and healing

Healthy fats, to regulate hormones and aid vitamin absorption

Complex carbohydrates, to maintain energy levels and support brain function

Fibre, for digestive health and blood sugar stability

Vitamins and minerals, to prevent deficiencies and support cellular processes

Without regular intake of these nutrients, individuals on weight loss medication may experience fatigue, dizziness, constipation, poor concentration, or longer-term health risks.

Skipping meals consistently, even unintentionally, can also slow progress — particularly if the body begins to conserve energy or lose muscle mass.

Practical Principles for Eating Without Hunger
When appetite is reduced, the approach to food must shift. The emphasis moves from eating in response to hunger to eating with purpose and structure.

1. Stick to a Routine
Even if you're not hungry, structured eating — such as breakfast, lunch, and a light evening meal — helps maintain stability in your day. Think of meals as functional rather than optional.

2. Smaller, Nutrient-Dense Portions
Focus on quality over quantity. Small portions of nutritionally dense food can deliver what your body needs without overwhelming your reduced appetite.

3. Choose Easily Tolerated Foods
Soft, mild-tasting, or cold foods may feel easier to eat when your appetite is low. These can include items like boiled eggs, yogurt, oats, or soups.

4. Prioritise Protein
Protein becomes particularly important during a weight loss journey to protect lean body mass. Try to include a source of protein at every eating opportunity.

5. Stay Hydrated — But Don’t Replace Meals with Fluids
Water is essential, but drinking large volumes close to mealtimes may reduce what little appetite you have. Time fluids accordingly, and don’t rely on tea or coffee alone to “get by.”

Suggested Food Options for Low Appetite Days
Below are examples of practical, nutrient-focused food choices that are suitable for people experiencing strong appetite suppression. All are portion-controlled and gentle on the digestive system.

Breakfast or Light Morning Meal
Small bowl of porridge made with whole oats and semi-skimmed milk, topped with chopped nuts or seeds

A boiled egg with a slice of wholegrain toast

Greek yoghurt with a spoon of nut butter and a few berries

Cottage cheese with crackers and cherry tomatoes

Midday Meal or Lunch
Chicken, tuna, or hummus wrap (use half a wrap if full portions feel too much)

Lentil or vegetable soup with a piece of wholemeal bread

Rice salad with eggs, beans, or shredded chicken and a light olive oil dressing

Small jacket potato with cottage cheese and side salad

Evening Meal
Grilled salmon or tofu with steamed vegetables and sweet potato mash

Omelette with cheese, mushrooms, and spinach

Light stir fry with lean protein and brown rice

Pasta with tomato and lentil sauce, served with a side of greens

If You Need to Snack
Handful of mixed nuts or seeds

A small banana or sliced apple with peanut butter

Oatcakes with a thin layer of cream cheese

A boiled egg with cucumber slices

When Eating Becomes Difficult: What to Watch For
Strong suppression can sometimes lead people to eat far too little for too long. It’s important to remain aware of the following:

Unintentional under-eating (e.g., fewer than 800–1,000 calories consistently)

Lack of energy or light-headedness

Constipation or low fibre intake

Loss of interest in all food, even favourite items

Skipping meals for entire days

If any of these are persistent, speak with your healthcare provider. Weight loss medication is intended to support health, not diminish it. You may need support adjusting meal plans, spacing out food intake, or managing side effects.

Conclusion
Appetite suppression is a normal and expected feature of weight loss medication, but hunger reduction is not a reason to stop eating altogether. Your body continues to require nourishment for energy, repair, and long-term success.

By taking a structured, thoughtful approach to food — even on days when you don’t feel like eating — you’ll protect the progress you've made on your weight loss journey and support your overall health.

Meal planning, preparation, and consistency all play a vital role. The goal is not to “eat less and less,” but to eat smarter in a way that meets your needs, honours your body, and allows you to move forward sustainably.

So I sometimes watch this YouTuber Coffee and Cults who talks about pop culture, and she spoke about the Yellowjackets bonus episode. She said she talked to someone who had read the script but not seen the episode. She obviously can’t reveal her source but said you can take her word or not. She said the bonus episode was this: 

* Bonus episode is lore of Cabin daddy 
* Cabin daddy has a Cabin wife (played by Annabelle Wallace)
* Cabin wife’s character is an author, so the couple go to the cabin so that she can write her book. She’s writing while cabin daddy is out hunting and providing for them etc 
* Cabin wife is pregnant through the episode and gives birth while they are at the cabin 
* Cabin wife starts to lose her mind and the baby is crying a lot- apparently this was supposed to tie in to Shauna saying ‘can’t you hear him cry’ 
* So cabin wife is losing her mind and at one point in the episode she randomly starts to see this little girl coming to the cabin; you see this girl throughout the episode and it’s never clear if she is real or not (a figment in Cabin wife’s mind) apparently the little girl was supposed to tie in to season 2- eg the ‘friend’ Javi talks about and who was in his drawing
* Javi got the queen card from the little girl 
* Apparently there are deleted scenes from season 2 of Javi, showing him talking to someone, or showing a hand or a bit of hair to indicate a little girl 
* Coach Ben talking to the little girl shows what we were supposed to see with Javi
* The dripping- cabin daddy was supposed to fix a leak that he never fixed, which is what Mari hears. 
* The episode ends very dark- the baby is killed, then cabin wife takes her life. Cabin daddy comes back and sees his family is gone and kills himself. Apparently the death of the baby is supposed to be ambiguous, was it killed was it a sacrifice etc
* The little girl draws the symbol on the trees 

She mentions that the episode is meant to be very ambiguous just like the show with the wilderness vs reality and you’re not sure if the little girl is real etc

How am I supposed to forget when my brain demands I pull up the file and touch each piece? So I sit here, I know you're having your morning coffee too. I know youre listening to the birds greet the day too. I know what it felt like when you looked at me like I was the most precious thing in the world. It's not fair, I lie to myself constantly about moving on, about growing. I lie to the world, putting my mask on everyday to hide the ache I feel as each memory crosses my mind. Will I ever forget? The intensity that we once shared has become the forbidden fruit, never to be spoken of. Not even when the tension in the room is all encompassing. I know you feel it too. We remain just close enough but never close enough to touch, never close enough to reignite the burning embers below. We pretend it was some listful dream we both had, not the reality we shared. If we keep ignoring it, maybe, just maybe it will die out entirely. Maybe Temperance will lose her balance and the water will put out the fire for good.

## Key ⁤Features Analysis

the ideal 15-inch laptop sleeve should offer a blend of protection, portability, and convenience. The following features are critical considerations when ‍making your selection.

**padding Thickness and Material**

The amount and type of ⁣padding​ significantly impact​ the level of protection a sleeve offers. Look for sleeves with at least 5mm of high-density foam or‌ gel padding. These materials effectively cushion⁤ your laptop from impacts and absorb the impact of drops. A sleeve should also use a soft interior lining, such as microfiber⁢ or fleece,‍ to prevent ‌scratches⁤ on the laptop's surface.

**External Material Durability**

The exterior of the sleeve should‌ be constructed⁤ from a durable ‍and‍ water-resistant material.common options include ballistic nylon,polyester canvas,and neoprene. Ballistic nylon is known for ‌its exceptional tear resistance, while polyester canvas ⁤offers a good balance of ‍durability and affordability. ​Neoprene provides excellent water resistance and a snug fit. Reinforce the stitching⁣ at stress points, such as ⁢the corners and zipper areas, to ensure ⁣long-lasting reliability.

**Closure Mechanism**

The closure ⁤mechanism ‌prevents the laptop from⁤ falling ‌out and‍ keeps dust​ and ‍debris away. Zipper closures‌ are the most common, offering a secure and reliable​ seal. Look for zippers that are smooth and easy to operate, with sturdy pulls. Magnetic closures ⁣are quieter and more convenient, but they may not ⁤offer the‍ same level of security as zippers. Velcro closures are‌ also available,‍ but⁤ they⁢ can wear out over time and ⁤may attract lint.**Additional Storage Pockets**

Consider whether you need extra pockets ‌for accessories such as chargers, cables, mice, and pens. A dedicated accessory ‍pocket ⁤can definitely help you stay organized and avoid carrying a separate bag⁣ for these ‌items. look for pockets that are spacious enough to accommodate your accessories without adding⁢ excessive bulk to the sleeve. Elastic⁣ bands or straps ⁣within ‍the pockets ‌can help secure⁢ items​ and prevent them from shifting‍ around.

**Overall Dimensions and Fit**

The‌ sleeve should‍ provide a snug and ‍secure ⁣fit without being⁤ too‍ tight or too loose. Check the ‍internal dimensions of the sleeve to‍ ensure⁤ they are‌ compatible with your specific 15-inch ‍laptop model. A sleeve ‍that is too small may be challenging to close,while a sleeve that is too large may not provide adequate ⁤protection. It's ‌critically ⁣important to measure your‍ laptop's⁤ dimensions⁣ (length, width, and thickness) before purchasing a sleeve.**Design and Aesthetics**

While protection is paramount, the sleeve's design also matters.Choose⁢ a style that​ complements your personal⁢ taste and⁢ professional image. Sleeves are available⁣ in various colors, patterns, and materials. Consider whether ⁤you prefer a⁢ minimalist‍ design or ⁣a more elaborate one with extra features such as handles⁣ or shoulder straps.

I went virtually my entire senior year of high school without making any friends, and my place of work, while definitely full of some amazing people, hasn't brought me any luck with making good, close friends. It's been a lonely year of just losing people to sudden death, and I think I'm finally ready to put myself out there and meet someone new to go out and do stuff with. 

I enjoy reading, though don't expect me to be quick with it, and I love discussing stories with people and theories as I read them. I have an interest in writing, though above all, I love baking more than anything and am hoping to gain more skill in the field when I find a good bakery to work at. I'm not planning on college at the moment, though it's still a possibility. 

I feel like this city is a lot more than I give it credit for, and I would love to actually get around to seeing things. But, honestly, I don't know where to start, and I feel weird going out just by myself.

1mc9xci,https://i.redd.it/9lwy4qbv2tff1.jpeg,Simple Staging Equals Big Impact,"Sometimes, it's the little things that quietly do the heavy lifting.

Take this shot, for example. A simple stack of books. A green glass vase. A single faux stem. That’s it. Nothing wild or expensive. But the impact? It’s big. It tells a story of care, thoughtfulness, and intention—and it instantly softens the space.

The books aren’t just stacked—they're curated. The soft blues, creams, and beiges tie effortlessly into the pillows and sofa, pulling everything together like a ribbon on a gift. The glass vase adds a hit of transparency and color that catches the light and gives life to the tabletop. And the faux flower? It adds height, texture, and an organic touch in a setting filled with clean lines and polished surfaces.

This is the art of subtle staging.

You don’t need an overload of décor to make a place feel lived-in, loved, and well-designed. In fact, the less-is-more approach is what actually gives each item space to shine.

For realtors and builders in Edmonton, these small but strategic touches can completely change how buyers feel in a room. It’s not just a couch and a coffee table anymore—it’s a lifestyle moment. One that helps buyers emotionally connect with the space.

**So here’s the takeaway:**  
Don’t underestimate the quiet details. They might not scream for attention, but they whisper something powerful: *This home is cared for.* *This home has style.* *This home could be yours.*

If you’re a builder or a realtor looking to make your listings stand out in a sea of sameness, that’s exactly what I help with. Let's turn your listings into conversations buyers want to have.

 **Keep it simple. Keep it thoughtful. And always stage with purpose.**
