The taps at HEAVY Beer Company in Toledo on March 22, 2023.
HEAVY Beer’s announcement last week that it and its Oak Openings Metropark branch would close over the weekend followed by one day its parent company’s request for judicial dissolution that was prompted by an investor’s lawsuit against it.

As a result of the pending lawsuit Brian Chapman filed in September against Adams Street Committee LLC “and Chapman’s failure to fund operations as he had previously represented he would do, the company is unable to continue operations, seek funding, or otherwise carry on its business,” lawyer Sarah Skow wrote in the counterclaim filed Dec. 10 in Lucas County Common Pleas Court.

At issue in the lawsuit is $684,058.97 that Mr. Chapman claims as the sum of outstanding loans he made in 2023 and 2024 to Adams Street Committee, unreimbursed expenses he incurred on the company’s behalf, and nearly a year’s worth of deferred compensation.

In its response and counterclaim, the company flatly denied the loan and expense claims while acknowledging that “ongoing cash flow issues continued and resulted in the inability to pay Chapman,” as was also the case for its manager and executive team.

BLADE STAFF

HEAVY Beer Company to cease operations

“Chapman specifically stated he deferred his payroll because he was cashflowing the company, and it did not make sense for him to invest money to pay himself,” the response states.

Mr. Chapman demanded payment from Adams Street Committee on July 30.

He filed the lawsuit Sept. 4. It is pending before Judge Michael Goulding, who has scheduled an initial pretrial hearing on Jan. 9 and set a tentative trial date of Jan. 12, 2026, following a final/settlement pre-trial date of Dec. 2.

Adams Street Collective’s counterclaim seeks damages from Mr. Chapman in an amount exceeding $25,000 to be determined at trial.

Mr. Chapman’s lawsuit identifies, but does not include as defendants, Andrew Newby as chief executive of HEAVY Beer and Toledo Spirits Co. and Dustin Wade and Lukas Kummer as co-founders of Toledo Spirits and Adams Street Committee.

It also identifies Mr. Newby as a domestic partner of Kristen Kiser, with whom he co-owns Black Kite Coffee in the Old West End. Black Kite is a part owner of Adams Street Committee, and Ms. Kiser is a co-owner of Toledo Spirits, the lawsuit states.

Yet another company, Consolidated Spirits Inc., is listed as the owner of Toledo Spirits and as the largest owner, at about 42 percent interest, in Adams Street Committee.

The lawsuit contends Black Kite received a monthly, $1,500 fee from HEAVY Wheelhouse, the HEAVY operation at Oak Openings, “for ‘ongoing consulting and training’ services which neither plaintiff [Mr. Chapman] nor majority of other employees can verify are provided by Black Kite Coffee to HEAVY Wheelhouse.”

Adams Street denied that allegation in its response.

Undisputed is that on Oct. 25, 2022, and Jan. 8, 2023, Mr. Chapman entered investor agreements with Adams Street Committee — at Mr. Newby’s solicitation — in which he bought common shares in the company worth a combined $303,928.20.

The lawsuit states Mr. Newby also enlisted Mr. Chapman, in part because of his experience in construction and engineering, to “help buildout” HEAVY’s brewery on Hoffman Road.

Mr. Chapman “eventually” became chief operating officer and partner of HEAVY Beer Co., the lawsuit states, although the Adams Street response contends he bestowed that title upon himself and his “conduct undermined the company’s leaders’ authority.”

Mr. Chapman claimed total loans to Adams Street Committee of $398,500.

The company response denied that claim. Mr. Newby said Tuesday afternoon said that money was put in “as equity,” not a loan.

The total loss incurred by all investors was “probably approaching $2 million” when the dissolution filing was made, Mr. Newby said.

“All the shareholders are losing in this,” he said.

The Adams Street Committee response also contends that by filing his lawsuit, Mr. Chapman breached the investor agreements he signed in 2022 and 2023 that specify all investor-related disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration.

Mr. Chapman did not immediately return a call for comment. He said in his lawsuit that if the money he considers to have been a loan was actually supposed to be an investment, it violated federal securities law requiring such investments to be documented.

Hey everyone! I just got back from an amazing half-day trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito, and I had to share my experience. If you're visiting San Francisco, this is absolutely something you shouldn't miss.

I wasn't sure about booking a guided tour at first (I usually prefer exploring on my own), but man, am I glad I did! I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods and the whole process was super smooth.

The morning started with a convenient hotel pickup in San Francisco. Our guide was this incredibly knowledgeable local who shared fascinating stories about the area's history and ecology throughout the drive. The morning departure was perfect - we beat the crowds and got to experience the woods in peaceful tranquility.

Muir Woods itself? Absolutely mind-blowing. We spent about 1.5 hours walking among these ancient coastal redwoods that are seriously tall - like, hundreds of feet tall! The morning light filtering through the canopy created this magical atmosphere that my photos barely do justice to. The trails are well-maintained and easy to walk, and our guide pointed out things I would've completely missed on my own.

After the woods, we headed to Sausalito, this gorgeous waterfront town that looks like it belongs on the Mediterranean coast. We had 45 minutes to explore, which was enough time to grab a coffee, check out some cute shops, and snap photos of the bay. Pro tip: Some people in our group chose to stay longer in Sausalito and take the ferry back to SF (it's included in the tour price) - smart move if you want more time there!

We also made a photo stop at the Golden Gate Bridge - the views were incredible (thankfully it wasn't too foggy). The whole trip took about 5 hours, which felt just right - not too rushed, not too long.

Here's what I loved most about this tour:
- No hassle with parking or entrance fees (all included)
- Comfortable transportation
- Super knowledgeable guide
- Perfect timing to avoid crowds
- Flexibility with the return options

If you're planning to do this trip (which you absolutely should), here's the link I used to book: https://athometouch.com/MuirWoods. The price honestly felt like a steal considering everything that's included - transportation, entrance fees, guide, and the optional ferry return.

after work i’m pretty mentally exhausted, and i have a tendency to let my after-work “recovery” time drag on for way too long. so sometimes i try to get started on schoolwork right afterwards before i get a chance to lose steam…but i get so psyched out and demotivated that i’m in such a long block of work (in the same spot! i do both work-work and schoolwork at my desk) 

i feel like changing locations could maybe help (and i try to do that sometimes, ie going to a coffee shop or library after work) but these places close a bit early and when i factor showering/getting ready to go out and transport time (the place open latest, my school library, is ~45 mins away and even that’s only open until 10) it’s hard to justify that “lost” time i could be devoting to my schoolwork. also, the cost of coffee shops get to be a bit too much money.

1hgjhcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/thanksimcured/comments/1hgjhcq/confused_about_what_to_do_if_im_being_honest/,Confused about what to do if I'm being honest...,"So... I am morbidly depressed, more functional in appearance and attitude than I mean to be. When I was 24, i decided that it was either get on medication or end it all, and I opted for medication. I was on so many different drugs and combinations for a little over six years.

After then, I realized that nothing was helping, that if anything, I was only getting worse, being more impulsive, getting crazier and more irrational. I panicked almost gave up. 

I was in an awful relationship filled with empty promises and a ton of false hope, totally and hopelessly in love with the past and what things used to be and could have been. 

I was really hurt. I stopped eating. I started drinking from morning to night, I was doing drugs all throughout the day on top of the meds I was already on. I couldnt eat, look at or think about food without throwing up. At work, I was in the bathroom sobbing and getting sick every thirty minutes for an unknown amount of time. I was really inconsolable and I didn't know what to do. 

I eventually broke things off, but I still couldn't eat. I had to go to a ward, I had to be babysat after lying enough to leave, I told my best friend I'd just off myself while they were sleeping so they couldn't find me, and I made them cry. I quit my job after constant sexual harassment and being exposed to everything my ex had put me through (all of the consorts were there as well). 

I lost the place I'd moved to, and then was left without another option, and had to move back in with my ex. I finally found some place months after. It was cheap and undesirable in every way, but I figured it was better there. 

I was wrong. I was alone, in a place I hated, no money, still couldn't eat. Hell, when I went to the hospital I'd laughed bc the scale read at 117lbs and I thought it was broken. 

Eventually I was so upset, that I threw out all of my medication (or what was left of it.. the doctors were horrible at refilling them). 

I'm so happy I did this, because the three months following I became so much worse. I had to have someone around at all times to make sure I didn't check out. Once, I didn't answer my phone because I was sleeping, and one of my friends showed up in a panic thinking the worst.

.
Flash forward a year
.

I'm still miserable, but I'm eating like normal and I'm back to 135lbs. I've had a few jobs, but none of them stick. I have no health insurance any more, and my hand is messed up from working with it. There hasn't been a solution for it, though I've been told it's mild and I just need physical therapy. I still can't hold a half pot of water for coffee in the morning without feeling pain in my pointer finger that spreads to my thumb if I'm not gentle with it. I no longer have insurance. I can apply through the state, but don't know what to pick or where to go for the therapy. Every time I get referred out by a doctors office, it always takes me to someone I'm not covered to see anyway. 

I can't work. I have no money. Unemployment is an unbearable system to try and jump loops through. Disability takes forever and I'm certain I don't qualify anyway. I don't know what to do for work even. I'm so fucking stressed and depressed and I don't feel like moving around, I don't want to feel any more.

When I think about my depression and stressed state, I realize the bottom line isn't so much that it's a chemical imbalance in me, but a very large amount of my pain comes from outside sources and are things out of my control. I can't fix how the world works. I can't fix my body without taking steps in the medical world, but have no way of entering. I can't make someone hire me with the work record I have, and with how much my work ethic has plummeted. I can't apply myself any more. I don't know what I'm supposed to do if I can't be arsed to see anyone, talk about anything to anyone who can help, if I'm scared to take the steps I need, or too stressed to keep making calls and filling out paperwork for all this shit.

When im at my wits end, when im so close to just giving up, and then im presented with solutions that take an immense amount of effort, and i no longer have the energy, what the fuck do I do?

I want to give up - in which way I mean that, I am uncertain. I just know I don't want to try any more. Nothing I'd be able to find would be enough for half of any rent available anyway. I have stacked medical bills insurance didn't bother to cover, court fees and overdue rent, many services cancelled and avoided payments. 

I'm lost and busted and don't wanna do anything but dig a hole, get in it, and give up. 

And before we suggest therapy - I've been in therapy since I was 8, I am 32. I've never gotten someone I click with enough. Some help for a while, but then it's just a repetitive situation. I always hear the same things. The breathing, meditation, gut health, cbt, dbt, meds, etc.

We have two children (12 & 5) together, and although things haven't been pretty (really, ever...it's been a long and traumatic road), I accepted her and her decision when she decided to transition about a year and a half ago. There was a few things I worried about, including, but not limited to, our attraction for each other, our dedication to the family we've built, etc. One thing I was extremely worried about was her finding someone else and leaving me.

Well, it's happened. I didn't realize she was posting on fetlife and chatting up random men on bluesky. She took a trip to a bigger city nearby to go ""Christmas shopping"" but also sat down to meet with him. He's poly, has a poly gf, all that good stuff.

Now here's the kicker: in 2019/2020, back before her transition she was getting really heavy into the fet/hotwife/cuck scene and wanted my active participation. I tried. I couldn't. It emotionally wrecked me. I thought i put a stop to all of it, but found out a few months later that my partner had been in contact with some random male stranger online and some of the conversations was stuff like ""she doesn't know yet, but I'll get her warmed up to the idea."" I confronted my partner and also the person she had been communicating with. In retaliation my partner terrified my then 8 year old and manipulated her into this whole abuse story that never happened. I was forcibly removed from my home, drugged against my will, and ended up getting a DV advocate from the YWCA who helped me compile evidence, etc. Yada Yada.

Well, it wasn't only the court system. She ruined me with any family and friends we had. I was utterly alone, and only after pulling her head out of her ass in late 2020 did I find myself in just a worse postion... completely reliant on her with no community whatsoever.

The following years since 2020 haven't been peachy either, or I won't go into that.

But I'm done. I'm finished. She's out there basically dating and communicating with men when she promised me she wasn't attracted to men. That she loved me. That she still loves me but she needs this intimacy...

Like... she ruined intimacy for me back in 2020. I don't see myself in any form of long term or short term relationship at all. My kids need me more than I need to get my rocks off.

Anyway, we are isolated and there's no resources or community to help. So I'm now planning my exit with my daughters to go to the only support I have, ~350 miles away.

Anyway, his has been a repeating thing in our lives since we met. She's always chasing the new thing. Never giving a thought to the damage she's doing to others. She had been talking to this guy for two weeks before she went and had coffee with him, and has basically told me she'll be going on dates at least a couple times a month.

She needs to be treated ""as a woman"". 

She's treated me like a doormat our whole relationship.

# The Art of PPC Mastery

Pay-per-click advertising is like a fast-paced game of chess. The board is always changing, and you need to stay one step ahead. As we move into 2025, PPC is evolving faster than ever. What worked last year might not cut it now.

To win at PPC, you need to be quick, smart, and ready to try new things. It's not just about throwing money at ads anymore. It's about being clever with your budget and making every click count.

In this guide, we're going to look at 25 ways to squeeze more value out of your PPC campaigns. These aren't just ideas – they're battle-tested tactics that can help you get more conversions without breaking the bank.

We'll cover everything from picking the right keywords to crafting ads that people actually want to click. We'll also dive into how to use data to make smart decisions and how to use new tech to stay ahead of the competition.

The goal? To help you build PPC campaigns that don't just get clicks, but drive real business results. Let's get started.

# Building a Strong Foundation with Strategic Targeting

# Pinpoint Precision with Keywords

Keywords are the backbone of any PPC campaign. But in 2025, it's not enough to just pick a bunch of words related to your business. You need to be surgical about it.

Start with exact match keywords. These are like laser beams – they only trigger your ad when someone searches for that exact phrase. This might mean fewer clicks, but the clicks you do get are more likely to convert.

But don't stop there. Negative keywords are just as important. These tell Google what you don't want to show up for. For example, if you sell high-end watches, you might add ""cheap"" as a negative keyword. This stops your ad from showing up when someone searches for ""cheap watches,"" saving you money on clicks that probably won't convert.

The key is balance. Use exact match to zero in on your ideal customers, and use negative keywords to filter out the ones who aren't a good fit.

# Segmenting Audiences Like a Pro

Imagine trying to sell ice cream to everyone in a crowded stadium. Some people might be lactose intolerant, others might be on a diet, and some might just not like ice cream. That's why audience segmentation is so important in PPC.

Instead of targeting everyone, break your audience down into smaller groups based on things like:

* Behavior: How they interact with your website or ads
* Demographics: Age, gender, income level, etc.
* Interests: What they like, what they search for online

By doing this, you can create ads that speak directly to each group. Maybe you have one ad for young professionals and another for retirees. Or one for people who've visited your site before and another for new prospects.

This level of targeting might mean smaller audience sizes, but it often leads to higher conversion rates. It's about quality over quantity.

# Geotargeting at Its Finest

Location, location, location. It's not just important in real estate – it's crucial in PPC too. Geotargeting lets you show your ads to people in specific locations.

But in 2025, we're not just talking about targeting whole cities or countries. We're talking hyper-local targeting. This could mean:

* Targeting specific neighborhoods
* Showing different ads to people in different parts of a city
* Adjusting your bids based on how close someone is to your store

For example, if you run a pizza shop, you might increase your bids for searches made within a 2-mile radius of your store during dinner time. Or if you're a lawyer, you might target ads to people near courthouses.

The key is to think about where your ideal customers are and when they're most likely to need your product or service. Then use geotargeting to put your ads in front of them at just the right moment.

# Crafting Ads That Command Attention

# Headlines That Stop the Scroll

In the world of PPC, your headline is your handshake. It's your first chance to make an impression, and you only have a split second to do it.

A good headline does three things:

1. Grabs attention
2. Shows value
3. Encourages action

For example, instead of ""Buy Our Shoes,"" try ""Walk in Comfort: 50% Off Today Only!"" This headline grabs attention with the discount, shows value (comfort), and encourages immediate action.

Some tips for writing killer headlines:

* Use numbers when you can. ""5 Ways to Save on Car Insurance"" is more eye-catching than ""Save on Car Insurance.""
* Ask questions. ""Tired of High Energy Bills?"" speaks directly to a pain point.
* Use power words. Words like ""Exclusive,"" ""Limited,"" or ""Secret"" can create a sense of urgency.

Remember, your headline is competing with dozens of others on the search results page. Make it stand out.

# Dynamic Search Ads: Automating with Finesse

Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs) are like having a super-smart assistant who knows your website inside and out. They automatically create ads based on the content of your site.

Here's how they work:

1. Google scans your website
2. When someone searches for something related to your content, Google creates an ad on the fly
3. The ad uses a headline from your site that matches the search

DSAs are great for catching long-tail keywords you might have missed. They're also a good way to fill in gaps in your keyword list.

But they're not a set-it-and-forget-it solution. You still need to:

* Choose which pages on your site to use for DSAs
* Write compelling descriptions
* Set the right bids

Used right, DSAs can help you reach new customers and save time on keyword research.

# Responsive Search Ads: Versatility at Scale

Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) are like a mix-and-match outfit for your PPC campaign. You provide multiple headlines and descriptions, and Google mixes them up to create the best ad for each search.

Here's why RSAs are powerful:

* They adapt to different devices and screen sizes
* They can match more closely to what people are searching for
* They let you test many different ad combinations at once

To make the most of RSAs:

* Write at least 8-10 headlines and 3-4 descriptions
* Make sure each headline can work with any description
* Include your main keywords in at least 2 headlines
* Use your brand name in one headline

RSAs take some of the guesswork out of ad creation. They let you cast a wider net while still maintaining relevance.

# Ad Personalization for Deeper Engagement

Personalization is the secret sauce of effective PPC. It's about making each person feel like your ad was made just for them.

Some ways to personalize your ads:

* Use location insertion to show the user's city in the ad
* Create ads for different stages of the buying journey (awareness, consideration, decision)
* Use countdown timers for limited-time offers
* Show different products based on what the user has viewed on your site

For example, if someone has been looking at running shoes on your site, show them an ad for running shoes when they search for ""athletic wear.""

Personalization can significantly boost your click-through rates and conversions. It shows users that you understand their needs and have a solution tailored for them.

# Testing, Optimizing, and Iterating

# A/B Testing as a Non-Negotiable

A/B testing isn't just a good idea in PPC – it's essential. It's how you figure out what works and what doesn't.

Here's how to do A/B testing right:

1. Choose one element to test at a time (headline, description, CTA, etc.)
2. Create two versions that are identical except for that one element
3. Run both versions simultaneously
4. Collect data for at least a week (or until you have statistically significant results)
5. Analyze the results and implement the winner

Some things to A/B test:

* Different value propositions
* Emotional vs. rational appeals
* Short vs. long headlines
* Different calls to action

Remember, A/B testing is an ongoing process. What works today might not work tomorrow. Keep testing and refining.

# Landing Page Testing for Seamless Conversions

Your ad is only half the battle. The landing page is where the conversion happens. A great ad with a poor landing page is like a beautifully wrapped gift with nothing inside.

Here are some elements to test on your landing pages:

* Headline: Does it match the ad? Is it compelling?
* Layout: Single column or two columns? Where should the form go?
* Images: Product photos vs. lifestyle images? Video or static images?
* Call to Action: What text works best? What color should the button be?
* Form Length: How many fields can you remove without losing essential information?

Also, don't forget about load speed. A delay of just one second can reduce conversions by 7%. Use tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix speed issues.

# Ad Extensions Done Right

Ad extensions are like bonus features for your ads. They give you extra real estate on the search results page and can significantly improve your click-through rates.

Some key extensions to use:

* Sitelink Extensions: Add links to specific pages on your site
* Callout Extensions: Highlight key selling points or offers
* Structured Snippet Extensions: Show specific aspects of your products or services
* Call Extensions: Add a phone number to your ad
* Location Extensions: Show your address and a map marker

The trick is to use extensions that make sense for your business and add value for the user. Don't just add them all for the sake of it.

For example, if you're a local business, location extensions are a must. If you offer 24/7 phone support, call extensions can be a big draw.

Use extensions to give searchers more reasons to click on your ad and more ways to connect with your business.

# Fine-Tuning Campaign Performance

# Bid Adjustments That Work Smarter

Bid adjustments are like fine-tuning knobs for your PPC campaign. They let you increase or decrease your bids based on specific factors.

Some key bid adjustments to consider:

* Device: Maybe your ads perform better on mobile than desktop. Adjust accordingly.
* Location: Increase bids in areas where you get more conversions.
* Time of Day: If you know your conversions spike in the evening, raise your bids during those hours.
* Audience: Increase bids for people who have visited your site before.

The key is to use data to guide your adjustments. Look at your performance reports to see where you're getting the best results, then adjust your bids to capitalize on those opportunities.

# Automated Bidding Strategies

In 2025, letting algorithms handle your bidding isn't just an option – it's often the smartest choice. Google's automated bidding strategies use machine learning to optimize your bids in real-time.

Some popular strategies:

* Target CPA: Set a target cost per acquisition, and Google will try to get you as many conversions as possible at that cost.
* Target ROAS: Tell Google your desired return on ad spend, and it'll adjust bids to try and meet that goal.
* Maximize Conversions: This tells Google to get you as many conversions as possible within your budget.

The key is to choose a strategy that aligns with your business goals. If you're focused on profitability, Target ROAS might be best. If you're trying to grow your customer base, Maximize Conversions could be the way to go.

Remember, these strategies need data to work well. Give them time to learn and adjust before making big changes.

# Budget Allocation for Maximum Impact

Your PPC budget is like water in a garden – you want to direct it where it'll help things grow the most.

Here's how to allocate your budget effectively:

1. Identify your top-performing campaigns and ad groups
2. Ensure these high performers aren't limited by budget
3. Look for underperforming campaigns that are eating up budget
4. Either improve these campaigns or reallocate their budget to better performers
5. Set aside some budget for testing new ideas

It's also important to consider seasonality and trends. You might need to adjust your budget allocation throughout the year based on seasonal demand or industry events.

Remember, it's not just about spending more – it's about spending smarter.

# Dayparting for Optimal Ad Delivery

Dayparting is like being a good party host – you want to be there when your guests arrive, not after they've left.

Look at your data to see when your ads perform best. Maybe you get more conversions during business hours, or perhaps your B2C ads do better in the evenings.

Once you know your peak times:

1. Increase bids during these hours
2. Decrease bids or pause ads during low-performing times
3. Consider different ad copy for different times of day

For example, a coffee shop might run ""Start your day right"" ads in the morning and ""Afternoon pick-me-up"" ads later in the day.

Dayparting helps you make the most of your budget by focusing on the times when your audience is most likely to convert.

# Reaching Wider Audiences with Advanced Tools

# Lookalike Audiences for Expansion

Lookalike audiences are like cloning your best customers. You tell Google or Facebook about your high-value customers, and they find people with similar characteristics.

Here's how to use them effectively:

1. Start with a strong seed audience – your best customers or most engaged website visitors
2. Create multiple lookalike audiences with different levels of similarity
3. Test different ad messages with each audience
4. Monitor performance and adjust your targeting

Lookalike audiences can help you reach new people who are likely to be interested in your product or service. They're a great way to scale your campaigns while maintaining relevance.

# Remarketing Campaigns That Re-Engage

Remarketing is like following up after a first date. Someone showed interest in your business by visiting your site – now's your chance to win them over.

Some effective remarketing strategies:

* Show ads to cart abandoners with a special offer to complete their purchase
* Create ads for people who visited specific product pages but didn't buy
* Use different messages for recent visitors vs. those who haven't been to your site in a while

Remember to set frequency caps so you don't annoy people with too many ads. And always provide value – don't just remind them you exist, give them a reason to come back.

# Incorporating Video Ads for Engagement

Video ads aren't just for big brands anymore. With platforms like YouTube, any business can create engaging video content.

Some tips for effective video ads:

* Grab attention in the first few seconds
* Keep it short – 15 to 30 seconds is often ideal
* Include your brand message early
* Use captions – many people watch without sound
* Have a clear call to action at the end

Video ads can be great for building brand awareness and explaining complex products. They can also be used in remarketing to re-engage visitors with more detailed information.

# Leveraging Data for Smarter Decisions

# Conversion Tracking as a Compass

Conversion tracking is like having a GPS for your PPC campaigns. It tells you where you're going and how to get there faster.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Define what counts as a conversion for your business (sales, sign-ups, downloads, etc.)
2. Set up tracking for all these actions
3. Use this data to inform your bidding and budget decisions
4. Look beyond just the number of conversions – consider the value of each conversion

Don't just track the final sale. Track micro-conversions too, like newsletter sign-ups or video views. These can help you understand the customer journey and optimize your funnel.

# Competitor Analysis for Tactical Advantage

Keeping an eye on your competitors is like playing chess – you need to anticipate their moves to stay ahead.

Tools like SEMrush or SpyFu can show you:

* What keywords your competitors are bidding on
* What their ads look like
* How much they're spending

Use this information to:

* Find new keyword opportunities
* Get ideas for ad copy
* Identify gaps in your competitors' strategies that you can exploit

Remember, the goal isn't to copy your competitors, but to learn from them and find ways to differentiate yourself.

# Quality Score Optimization

Quality Score is Google's rating of the quality and relevance of your keywords and PPC ads. It's like a report card for your PPC efforts.

To improve your Quality Score:

1. Make sure your keywords, ad copy, and landing pages are closely aligned
2. Improve your click-through rate with compelling ad copy
3. Organize your account into tightly themed ad groups
4. Make your landing pages relevant and user-friendly
5. Use ad extensions to provide more value to searchers

A higher Quality Score can lead to lower costs and better ad positions. It's worth putting in the effort to improve it.

# Expanding Horizons with Cross-Channel PPC

# Cross-Platform Integration

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your PPC efforts across multiple platforms can help you reach more people and reduce your reliance on any single channel.

Consider running campaigns on:

* Google Ads
* Microsoft Advertising (Bing)
* Facebook/Instagram Ads
* LinkedIn Ads (especially for B2B)
* Amazon Ads (if you sell products)

The key is to tailor your approach to each platform. What works on Google might not work on Facebook. Use each platform's unique features to your advantage.

Also, think about how these platforms can work together. For example, you might use Facebook for brand awareness and Google for capturing high-intent searches.

# Local Service Ads for Hyper-Local Impact

If you're a local business, Google's Local Service Ads can be a game-changer. These ads appear at the very top of search results for local service queries.

Some benefits of Local Service Ads:

* You only pay when someone contacts you through the ad
* They show your business name, review rating, and years in business
* Google verifies your business, which can increase trust with potential customers

To make the most of Local Service Ads:

1. Make sure your Google My Business profile is complete and up-to-date
2. Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews
3. Be responsive to inquiries – your response rate affects your ranking

Local Service Ads can be a great way to stand out in competitive local markets.

# Automation and Efficiency Techniques

# Simplify Workflows with Scripts

PPC scripts are like having a robot assistant for your campaigns. They can automate repetitive tasks and make adjustments based on rules you set.

Some useful things you can do with scripts:

* Automatically pause low-performing ads or keywords
* Adjust bids based on weather conditions
* Send alerts when certain conditions are met (like a sudden drop in CTR)
* Generate custom reports

You don't need to be a coding expert to use scripts. There are many pre-written scripts available that you can customize for your needs.

# Streamline Campaigns Through Automation

Beyond scripts, there are many ways to automate your PPC management:

* Use automated rules to make changes based on performance thresholds
* Set up automated email reports to keep stakeholders informed
* Use tools like Zapier to connect your PPC platforms with other business tools

The goal of automation isn't to set it and forget it. It's to free up your time so you can focus on strategy and analysis rather than routine tasks.

# Seasonal and Event-Driven Campaigns

# Seasonal Adjustments for Timely Relevance

Your PPC strategy shouldn't be static. It should breathe with the seasons and pulse with events.

Here's how to stay relevant year-round:

1. Create a marketing calendar with key dates and events
2. Plan campaigns around major holidays and industry events
3. Adjust your messaging and offers to match the season
4. Be ready to capitalize on unexpected trends or events

For example, a fitness equipment company might focus on New Year's resolutions in January, beach body goals in spring, and home workout equipment during flu season.

Remember to start your seasonal campaigns early. Many people start shopping or planning well before the actual event or holiday.

# Conclusion: Your 2025 PPC Playbook

PPC in 2025 is all about being smart, agile, and data-driven. It's not enough to just bid on keywords and hope for the best. You need to:

1. Know your audience inside and out
2. Craft messages that resonate on a personal level
3. Use data to guide every decision
4. Stay on top of new features and trends
5. Continuously test and optimize

Remember, success in PPC is in the details. It's about making small improvements across many areas of your campaigns. Each tweak might only improve things a little, but together, they can lead to significant gains.

The PPC landscape will keep changing. New features will emerge, consumer behavior will shift, and competition will evolve. The key to success is to stay curious, keep learning, and never stop testing.

Your PPC campaigns are a work in progress. Keep refining, keep optimizing, and keep pushing for better results. With the right approach, PPC can be a powerful engine for growth in your business.

Now, armed with these 25 tactics, you're ready to take your PPC game to the next level in 2025. Good luck!

1hgjcbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/1hgjcbp/my_secret_suffering/,My secret suffering,"I’ve never shared this story anywhere, as it is one that has brought me so much pain and shame. 

At some point between ages 15-17 I started to get incredibly tired.  I am just chronically tired.  I’ve needed naps for as long as I can remember and have a terrible time waking up in the AM. I’ve been drinking coffee since age 16, crave sugar and carbs as well as anything that gets my adrenaline/excitement going and holds my attention and focus.  

Without that stimulation or a lot of caffeine, I get hit with waves of fatigue so intense that I have to think about my exit strategies in situations where I might desperately need to nap. The pandemic was actually a RELIEF for me, because I was constantly close to my bed and didn’t feel so much pressure to be out and about. I have been taking Cymbalta for years for the depression and anxiety that I constantly battle due to feeling so many setbacks professionally and personally because of exhaustion and a constant feelings of heaviness in my head and around my eyes when I'm awake, and I can't stop thinking about my next nap.

Four years ago when my son was diagnoses with Adhd, I was evaluated and told I had it too.  I started taking Adderall and Vyvanse and for the first time in decades I experienced alertness I never imagined.  It was the same as having blurry vision and then suddenly wearing eyeglasses. Wow.  Then I read that stimulants are the main prescription for idiopathic hypersomnia/ narcolepsy. I wonder if that is what I have been dealing with all along? Or maybe both?

I saw a sleep specialist and a home sleep test did not reveal sleep apnea, even though I snore.  She said I could do a lab test and the MSLT but I would need to be off all my medication before it would provide an accurate reading. My husband thought my going off of Cymbalta could be dangerous for my mental health. 

The sleep specialist said that if I were diagnosed with IH or Narcolepsy, that the treatment would be stimulants.  Which I already take. So maybe I don’t need to deal with the lab test?  

However, I am wondering if any of you who take typical Adhd medications like Adderall or Vyvanse find that they lose effectiveness quickly and you must increase the dose for them to work? I try to take a medication holiday at least once a week to allow my body to reset so they might work again at a usual dose…but I’m wondering if any of you have found a dose of typical Adhd stimulants that works and you don’t have to keep upping the milligrams to feel the effects?",1,1734465583.0,idiopathichypersomnia,0,1.0,False

And it appears to be working. HOWEVER my mom guilt is suddenly eating me up that I have done something wrong by being so aggressive about night weaning so early, especially because I see so many posts that night feeds are developmentally appropriate until 8-12 months.

Our girl is EFF and eats 32oz in 24 hours across 5 bottles. She has 7oz first thing in the morning and then 6oz at 11, 2, and 5. Then one final 7oz bottle before bed. She drains the bottles every time--not a drop left. She is, growth-wise, on a great trajectory. She is skinny (37th for weight) but LONG (99.9th for length!). She also started consolidating daytime sleep really nicely and is on a 3/3/3.5 schedule with two long naps (1.5 hours, 1 hour). She does great with the long wake windows and only starts showing sleepy cues in the last 15-20 minutes of the WW. Otherwise, she is happy though may have a short bridge nap if we're out in the car.

We had been giving her a dream feed up until last week and slowly faded it out by adding the ounces of the dream feed into her daytime bottles. She does not wake up and cry consistently in the night. Sometimes, she wakes up and fusses for about 30 seconds-2 minutes to reposition herself. For example, per our nursey app, this is last night's data:

* 7:59pm - in crib for night. Cried from 7:59pm - 8:07pm (this is her process, she always does a bit of crying before cooking out)
* 8:39pm - 30 seconds of fussing--rolled onto belly and fell back to sleep
* 9:23pm - 25 seconds of fussing, fell back to sleep
* 11:02pm - 34 seconds of fussing, back to sleep
* 11:59pm - 21 seconds of fussing, back to sleep
* **THESE NEXT FEW INSTANCES ARE WHERE I'M UNSURE**
   * 12:56am - 12:58am - fussing (not full-blown crying) for 2 minutes, then quiet
   * 1:07am - 1:09am - fussing (not full-blown crying) for 2 minutes, then quiet
* 6:55am - 17 seconds of fussing, back to sleep
* 7:36am - awake for the day, chattering to herself in the crib while mom pees, brushes teeth, makes coffee, etc
* 7:49am - out of the crib for the morning

Technically speaking, the 5/3/3 rule would mean if she's crying after 1:00am with a bedtime of 8:00pm, we should feed her, right? But she's not really crying...more like fussing...IDK

Am I doing something wrong? Should I let her be? What is everyone's experiences? I guess I was under the impression that sleep training meant absolutely no crying from 8pm to 8am hahaha. ",1,1734465521.0,sleeptrain,0,1.0,False

I’ve been obsessing over one person for the past months, to the point where I feel like I’m in love with them—even though they have a partner. Recently, I invited them out for coffee (something casual) with their partner as a thank-you for their support during a very traumatic event earlier this year. They suggested I invite other people to the gathering, which I actually think is a great idea. However, I became so focused on them that I forgot about all the other people who helped me at the time. That realization makes me feel selfish, and I can’t stop worrying that I might have made them uncomfortable.

I’m currently on Lamictal (175mg) and Abilify (10mg). I’ve read that Abilify can help with obsessive thoughts, but my fixation on this person is still intense—to the point where I even dream about them. It’s hard to pull my thoughts away, and it’s becoming overwhelming.

I’m wondering if anyone has tools or strategies to manage hyperfixations/obsessions, particularly in relation to bipolar disorder. I’m considering talking to my provider in two weeks about increasing my Abilify dosage or possibly adding another medication. I’ve read that SSRIs can be helpful, but I’m hesitant because they tend to trigger manic episodes for me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After undergoing teeth whitening, you might be eager to return to your normal eating habits. However, understanding the best timing for when to eat normally is crucial for maintaining your newly brightened smile. Generally, it is recommended to wait at least 24 to 48 hours before consuming certain foods and beverages. This waiting period allows the whitening treatment to set in properly and minimizes the risk of staining your teeth.

So, why is there a waiting period? Many professional teeth whitening procedures use strong bleaching agents that can temporarily increase the pores in your enamel. This makes your teeth more susceptible to staining immediately after the treatment. Foods and drinks that are highly pigmented can easily seep into these pores, leading to unwanted discoloration. If you want to protect your investment in a brighter smile, it's vital to be mindful of what you consume after whitening.

The timing can vary depending on the specific whitening method used. Here’s a breakdown:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-office whitening treatments:** If you have just undergone an in-office treatment, it's advisable to wait at least 48 hours before eating any strongly colored foods or drinking dark liquids. Items like red wine, coffee, tea, and dark sodas are best avoided during this time.
- **At-home whitening kits:** While at-home kits are often less potent than in-office treatments, it's still smart to wait around 24 hours before consuming potentially staining foods.
- **Whitening strips or trays:** Similarly, if you're using whitening strips, it is recommended to refrain from eating about 30 minutes to an hour after removing them, to allow the whitening agents to work effectively.

Many people wonder what specific foods to watch out for post-whitening. Here are some key categories:

- **Highly pigmented foods:** Be cautious with foods like beets, blueberries, cherries, and dark sauces. These can stain your teeth quickly.
- **Acidic foods:** Foods like citrus fruits and vinegar can weaken enamel, making it easier for stains to take hold. It’s advised to enjoy these foods within moderation a few days after whitening.
- **Dark beverages:** Coffee, tea, soda, and red wine should be avoided for a minimum of 48 hours. These drinks can quickly lead to discoloration if consumed too soon.

On the other hand, there are many foods that are safe to eat right after your teeth whitening treatment. Here are some recommendations:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **White or light-colored foods:** Foods like mashed potatoes, rice, and chicken are safe options that won’t risk staining your teeth.
- **Non-pigmented drinks:** Clear beverages like water, white wine, or light-colored herbal teas are excellent choices.
- **Dairy products:** Milk, yogurt, and cheese can be enjoyed as they help neutralize the acids left by certain foods.

It's not just about avoiding specific foods and drinks—how you care for your teeth post-whitening can impact your results. Here are some strategies to maintain your bright smile:

- **Adopt good dental hygiene:** Keep up with your regular brushing and flossing routine. Consider waiting at least 30 minutes to brush after whitening to avoid any enamel erosion.
- **Rinse your mouth:** After eating or drinking, a quick rinse with water can help wash away any remnants of food and prevent staining.
- **Use a straw:** If you must drink something pigmented, using a straw can minimize contact with your teeth.

Ultimately, waiting the right amount of time before diving back into your regular diet will significantly enhance the results of your teeth whitening experience. This extra attention will pay off in long-lasting brightness and a more beautiful smile. So plan your meals wisely for the first couple of days after your treatment. You’ll enjoy your food and protect your investment in your smile for years to come.

Foods to Avoid After Teeth Whitening: Best Practices for Maintaining Your Bright Smile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After undergoing a teeth whitening treatment, you’ll want to maintain that beautiful bright smile for as long as possible. However, certain foods and drinks can hinder your results, leading to discoloration and dullness. In this guide, we’ll highlight the foods to avoid right after teeth whitening and best practices to protect your pearly whites.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding Teeth Whitening Sensitivity

Teeth whitening can make your teeth temporarily more sensitive. This sensitivity means that your teeth are more vulnerable to stains from foods and beverages you consume right after the treatment. Therefore, being mindful of your diet is crucial during this period.

### Foods and Beverages to Avoid

To ensure your bright smile lasts, it's essential to steer clear of the following items:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Dark-colored beverages:** Drinks like coffee, red wine, black tea, and dark sodas can stain your newly whitened teeth due to their strong pigments.
- **Highly pigmented foods:** Foods such as blueberries, blackberries, and dark sauces (like soy sauce or tomato sauce) can leave marks on your enamel.
- **Citrus fruits:** While healthy, fruits like lemons and oranges can increase tooth sensitivity and may wear down whitening agents.
- **Spicy foods:** Spices like chili or curry can not only irritate sensitive teeth but may also have vibrant colors that stain easily.
- **Sugary snacks:** Candy and other sugary treats can promote bacteria, leading to plaque build-up, which dulls your smile.
- **Acidic foods:** Vinegar-based dressings and acidic foods can weaken enamel temporarily, increasing the risk of staining.
- **Processed foods:** Fast foods and convenience meals are often packed with additives that could impair your whitening efforts.

### Timing Matters

Generally, it's advisable to wait at least 48 hours after your teeth whitening procedure before consuming any of the above foods or drinks. This waiting period allows your enamel to harden and recover from the treatment.

### Best Practices for Maintaining Your Bright Smile

In addition to avoiding certain foods, follow these best practices to keep your smile bright:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Use a straw:** When consuming beverages, especially those that can stain, using a straw can help keep the liquid away from your teeth.
- **Brush regularly:** Maintaining your oral hygiene with a good brushing and flossing routine will help prevent any build-up of staining substances.
- **Natural whitening agents:** Consider using baking soda or activated charcoal a couple of times a month. These can help absorb stains without damaging your enamel.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away stains, keeping your teeth clean and bright.
- **Professional touch-ups:** Periodic professional whitening treatments can help maintain the brightness of your smile.

### What to Eat After Teeth Whitening

While there are foods to avoid, there are also ones that are safe and beneficial for your smile:

- **White foods:** Foods such as chicken, fish, pasta, and rice won’t stain your teeth and are good options in the days following your treatment.
- **Non-acidic fruits:** Apples, bananas, and pears are not only safe but also nutritious.
- **Low-stain vegetables:** Try cooked vegetables like cauliflower, lettuce, or potatoes that won’t pose a staining threat.
- **Dairy products:** Milk, cheese, and yogurt can help strengthen and balance your tooth enamel.

Ultimately, the key to maintaining your newly whitened teeth is being aware of what you eat and following the right practices. By avoiding certain foods and incorporating safe options into your diet, you can enjoy a bright, beautiful smile for longer. Remember, your smile is worth the extra effort!

### Conclusion

Maintaining your white smile after teeth whitening involves careful attention to what you eat and when. After a professional whitening treatment, it's generally best to wait at least 24-48 hours before eating normally. This pause allows your enamel to settle and reduces the risk of staining from foods and drinks that can be harsh on freshly whitened teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
In the days immediately following your whitening procedure, it's crucial to avoid vibrant-colored foods and drinks such as red wine, coffee, tea, and dark berries. Opting for light, neutral-colored foods like chicken, rice, bananas, and yogurt can help you maintain your brighter smile.

Your diet plays a significant role in preserving your results. Continuing to dodge foods known for staining, even as you return to your regular eating habits, will further extend the lifespan of your treatment. Hydration is also essential, so washing down meals with water instead of sugary or acidic beverages can aid in keeping your teeth clear of stains.

I know the sun sets early. I know a lot of people *hate* that it gets dark a little after 4 this time of year. However, Atlantic Time will not solve these problems, and it will create new problems that we don’t currently have that will hurt people the current system doesn’t hurt. 

Yes, this is my opinion, but my opinion is backed up by both scientific and historical evidence. Scientifically, peer-reviewed studies ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6436388/ ) have shown that living on the western edge of time zones leads to many worse health outcomes, including cancer. The lack of morning light that western edges of time zone face means people spend more time awake in the dark, and this leads to worse health overall.

Historically, it turns out the United States already tried permanent daylight saving time (https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2022-03-19/the-u-s-tried-permanent-daylight-saving-time-in-the-1970s-then-quickly-rejected-it), and it turns out people *hated* it despite huge margins initially thinking it would be great. Why? Well, everyone got caught up in the thought of later sunsets, and forgot this meant later sunrises too. Previous to this, as it is now, lots and lots of schoolchildren and *uncaffeinated* adults went to work or school in daylight. If you’re already waking up and haven’t had coffee yet, it being light out really helps you wake up. If these people are plunged into morning darkness, this will make the seasonal lack of light a worse problem for morning workers and kids.

Here’s the thing: there are *no* good options to make the days brighter for people here in December, because we live far from the equator. No light will be gained with Atlantic Time. Instead, it will be taken away from the uncaffeinated just woken up adults and schoolchildren who need it the most.

That cup of coffee sparked something. Since then, coffee has been more than caffeine for us—it’s become a daily ritual. We wake up before the kids, pour a cup, and read together. It’s how we start every day connected and grounded.

Now, we’re creating something for *beginners* who want to explore specialty coffee but don’t know where to start. I wish I had this when I first tried Southern Weather.

1hgj58l,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1hgj58l/lost_at_25_years_old/,Lost at 25 years old.,"First off I would like to say my life is not bad at all, I am just lost.

Heya, I'm posting here in hopes to get some help and r/findapath. I am a 25 year old male, athletic and in great mental health as well, I take care of myself, I have a dead end job that makes nice money, but constantly looking to improve and start a career.

I would like to share my backstory so you get my issue, I was uprooted when I was 6 years old with my family to a strange country, we came here with NOTHING. No money, friends, help, or even barely the language. Growing up was a real struggle for us, I have been working since I was 13 years old to help my parents offload at least some of the struggle (save them some money). I have had some trauma growing up, which effected my behavior at school resulting in my position today, along with an odd ADHD diagnosis I kind of had a jittery start (I am well aware of how lucky I am aswell).  I was put on meds most of my childhood which either completely numbed me out or hurt my appetite which resulted in more issues, you get the idea. During school I was not the best student and didn't have the best grades, but I have always had an insane work ethic and can work 16 hours shifts without blurping out a word (from my experience with coworkers). I enlisted in to the army and got released half way through because of many issues including some PTSD and financial issues at home. after release which was 5 years ago, I have held two jobs, One as a store clerk selling gambling tickets, smokes, and coffee I worked there for a total of three years, during my three years I attempted a Fullstack web deveploment bootcamp which I successfully completed, finishing that I went back work at the first job I mentioned (the owners are well known and have many connections) in which they constantly promised me job opportunities that never came to life. I was being led along and foolishly believing them. I continued to search for work in said field with no luck, but I will add that I wasn't willing to drive a total of 4.5 hours a day in order to get my first job (Which i also now regret). I was then offered the job I currently hold, which is basically an amazon/aliexpress ripoff in my country and I ""kind of"" manage the shop, while the manager left to help out for the passed year with another shop I stood up and managed the place, making sure everything sailed smoothly in the rugged boat. The issue with this job is that its a dead end, I am at the maximum you can make in my current position, and I feel stuck. Fullstack isn't an option anymore for me, the market is way too competitive and developers here now a days are a dime a dozen (there are many that are way more qualified). I have learnt over multiple jobs over the years that I am indeed very good at talking and at sales. I can sell a flashlight to a blind person and new echo location technology to bats, the issue is I do not know how or where to implement said skill. My current job is a sales clerk for said company, I sell technological products 9 hours a day and serve around 250 different customers daily. Mind you, grinding is not an issue for me so If I have to grind another course to move up the ladder and move on I have no issue in doing so. I just don't know where to look and would love some human input. Every time I try to bring up the issue with friends or family I get the generic ""It will be ok!, You're young!, have fun!"". So far I have tried looking at multiple trades and career paths but nothing is jumping out at me, I attempted recruiting in to the police force but I was not accepted as of yet, and it doesn't look good. I wouldn't say I am messed up but I would say I was misguided growing up and needed a bit more refining that my parents couldn't provide (constantly working). I am also not very interested in getting a degree, 4 years of college is daunting to me, I know that if I put myself to it I could, but if there is another viable option please show me the way.  
 I am done having fun, I want to move up, I want to eventually own a nice car and even CONSIDER buying a home, I want to be able to provide for my family. I would like to add one last thing, I make A LOT of money considering where I live and living expenses, and I do not say that lightly but I also accustomed to less, so my fortune is another mans poor. But I also do want to utilize the money somehow, build a business, start some side hustle, pay for some schooling to move up a step, I just have NO CLUE where to start. I only know that I indeed can close deals and love working with other human beings (human beings tend to love me back).

One of the most compelling advantages of lupine is its remarkably short growth time, coupled with the ability to be sourced locally. This delightful duo not only slashes transportation emissions but also enhances resource efficiency—talk about a double whammy!

By choosing this swiftly maturing crop, farmers can offer fresh, nutrient-rich produce to their communities, thus promoting food sovereignty and sustainability without breaking a sweat.

Being so easy to grow it also offers every consumer the possibility to grow their own “coffee” for maximum sustainability.

This strategic shift not only breathes new life into local economies, as farmers engage directly with consumers, but it also cultivates a strong sense of community resilience and food safety. With shorter grow cycles, growers can respond to market demands faster than you can say ""locally sourced,"" minimizing food waste while maximizing profits.

These natural ingredients do more than just tantalize the palate; they pave the way for exciting food alternatives while diminishing the dependence on overly processed options. Thus, lupine emerges as a savvy choice for those in pursuit of nutritious and inventive culinary practices.

**Potential Drawbacks of Lupine**

While lupine boasts a myriad of health benefits, one must also ponder the potential drawbacks, including allergies and dietary precautions that some individuals may need to navigate.

Similar to soy and other legumes, lupine contains phytoestrogen that acts similarly to estrogen in women and men.[ It has been hypothesized to use phytoestrogen to defend against the overpopulation of herbivore animals by controlling male and female fertility and sex drive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogen)

[A study in Japanese men found soy consumption reduced E2 (a type of estrogen) levels but not androgens, while a 3-month trial with 60 mg/day of soy isoflavones showed no change in E2 or testosterone but increased SHBG (a protein that binds hormones, reducing their activity) and decreased free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468963/). In an open-labeled, non-randomized clinical trial of men with higher levels of PSA (**Prostate-Specific Antigen**, which is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. It is often measured in a blood test as a marker for prostate health), free testosterone was depleted after 12 months of daily consumption of 141 mg of isoflavones in soy milk. So beware if you're a male or want children.

After all, even the most nutritious legume can come with its share of caveats. Just as one wouldn’t dive headfirst into a pool without checking the water depth, being aware of personal health risks and employing proper preparation methods is crucial.

This way, one can fully savor the advantages of lupine without the unwanted side effects that might rain on this nutritious parade.

Lupine coffee may be a viable choice for many, but its phytoestrogen content raises concerns for hormone-sensitive individuals. For a deeper dive into how plant-based options impact our health and the planet, explore:

**Other Healthier Alternative: Chicory Coffee**

Chicory coffee outshines lupine coffee when it comes to health benefits and safety for a wider audience. Chicory root is rich in inulin, a powerful prebiotic that supports gut health by feeding beneficial bacteria and improving digestion. Unlike lupine coffee, which contains phytoestrogens that may disrupt hormonal balance in some individuals, chicory coffee is free of such compounds, making it a safer option for everyone, including those sensitive to estrogenic effects. Plus, its robust, slightly nutty flavor mimics traditional coffee without caffeine, making it a superior, health-conscious alternative.

 



**Chicory Coffee: A Prebiotic Powerhouse**

When discussing healthier coffee alternatives, chicory stands out due to its high inulin content, which supports gut health and digestion without the hormonal disruption risks associated with lupine coffee.

**Allergies and Precautions**

Allergies to lupine may be rare, but they do exist, making it imperative for those with legume allergies to tread carefully when venturing into this alternative realm. Understanding the potential health risks and dietary nuances is not just advisable—it's essential for enjoying the delightful perks of this high-protein food source without unwelcome surprises.

For the particularly sensitive among us, lupine can unleash allergic reactions akin to those triggered by peanuts or soy, with symptoms ranging from itching and swelling to gastrointestinal distress. Therefore, consulting a healthcare professional before introducing lupine into one’s diet is not merely a suggestion; it’s a prudent step toward culinary safety.

Diligently scrutinizing food labels is also wise, as lupine can sometimes make clandestine appearances in processed foods, flour alternatives, and even those seemingly innocent gluten-free products.

Maintaining rigorous kitchen hygiene practices, particularly to prevent cross-contamination, is crucial for anyone navigating the treacherous waters of food allergies. By being well-informed and taking proactive measures, individuals can effectively safeguard their health while indulging in the nutritional wonders that lupine has to offer.

To start, I am 6'3 and weigh 245lbs, although looking at me you'd think I weight much less. I used to sit plateaued at 235 until I started taking Zoloft to deal with depression, currently I seem stuck at 245. Due to a knee injury I am unable to do a lot of strenuous exercise like running, biking, etc. I am also trying to save money so I cannot use those ""Healthy Meal Delivery Services"" or spend a ton on groceries. My target weight would be about 190 lbs, or basically just a little skinny. I am well aware that my diet is god awful, but a lot of it stems from convenience and cost. Weekends can be a wild card as I often visit friends and am typically at the mercy of whatever cheap things I can get while out (Usually fast food, blegh)

Typically during the work week my meals look something like this:

Breakfast: Breakfast sandwich and hasbrown w/monster energy or flavored coffee $4.33 (I get it because it's such a cheap deal and found it to be cheaper than buying my own breakfast stuff. I do not have time to cook breakfast in the morning as I already get up fairly early and my roommate is up well before me using the kitchen so cooking my own breakfast is not an option. We have a microwave at work but no other cooking utilities)

  
Lunch: Typically a couple of the maruchan yakisoba noodles. They're super cheap and I can basically have lunch for 2 bucks. about once or twice a week I will instead get one of those salad kit bags and eat that instead.

  
Dinner: It really varies. Sometimes pizza, sometimes chicken nuggets and fries, sometimes macaroni and cheese, I recently made takoyaki. Dinner is usually a wild card and depends on what I have available, my finances, and how much I feel like cooking. My roommate is also in the kitchen when I get off work and want to cook, so it makes it hard as it means I go to my room and settle down and lose any motivation to do anything. I typically spend most of my time playing video games with friends after work. Weekends can vary on what I do but I usually try to get out of the house to see people if I can.

  
I work a semi-physical job that is mixed sitting, standing and walking throughout the day with some lifting as well. At home I am often sitting or laying down. I constantly have brain fog and kind of feel like I'm just always on autopilot, and unsure if dietary issues (Among other things) are contributing to this. I typically go to bed anywhere between 11 to 12 p.m. on average and get up around 6:30-6:45.

I would prefer solutions that do not include deviating from my normal activities, but rather things that can be done throughout the day that work with the schedule I already have. I am open to meal and dietary suggestions that aren't expensive. 



I tried dieting at one point by going on a brisk 30 minute walk on my lunch break and eating a salad and yogurt for lunch, breakfast was just a sausage biscuit, and dinner was random, but I remember eating more rice and fish. I got fed up because after a month and a half of basically only eating 1200-1600 calories (Basically halving my intake), I had only lost 2 lbs, and I wonder if it was just water weight.

  
I want to lose weight but I don't want to sacrifice the routine I have so I would really appreciate some creative solutions on this! I know I'm not making it easy, but for personal reasons I need to keep it how it is.

  
Thanks in advance!

I'm pretty new to pourover and never used a zero bypass method before. Surely I can't just use my old recipes now right? Zero bypass means much longer draw down potentially. I also recently watched [this lance hedrick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzgD0AwrTvg) with Matt Winton. They're talking about the importance of contact points in pourover. The gist being, the more contact points, the faster the drawdown. They're predominantly advocating for the use of mesh screens in flat bottom brewers like the orea. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone with experience of this hack has any advice about how it might change brew times and recipes. Also has anyone tried using thinner papers to balance this out, or tried introducing more contact points somehow?

Keep playing those mixtapes they made you. Analyze every lyric like it’s a hidden clue. Was it a warning sign that something was breaking? No, no—it wasn’t them; it was you. You just cared too much.

Lie awake night after night, staring at your phone. Maybe tonight you’ll finally summon the strength to silence the thoughts—those relentless echoes of your loneliness—or maybe you’ll just hope, for one fleeting moment, to feel the warmth of love given back as fiercely as you give it.

Go out for coffee alone, four days a week. Always carry your notebook. Write relentlessly. Leave little comics or thank-you notes with your tip, and watch the barista smile as you walk back to your car.

Convince yourself, again and again, that you deserve this life. That the emptiness is your punishment. You must have done something, right? Because now the tears don’t come, no matter how hard you try.

Ignore your friends for weeks at a time, even though they’re the only constant you have left. If they cared enough, they’d come looking for you—but they won’t. And really, who cares?

Slowly, let yourself drift away from the things you used to love. Watch yourself fade into the background like a shadow, content to play a secondary role in your own story. Don’t fight it.

And when the ache becomes unbearable, drown it. Let old, stolen rum flow down your throat. Learn to crave the burn and embrace the warmth as it settles in your stomach. Let it be the love you’ve been missing—the bottled comfort you can always rely on.

You don’t need anyone to cure your loneliness anymore. You just had to learn how to sit with it, speak to it, and call it your own",5,1734464614.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I haven’t changed my diet but my workout schedule (due to work) has me burning about 4000kcal per week. Most of my meals are cooked at home. I don’t measure anything. I hardly drink due to my exma schedule at work. I do love sugar in my coffee, though. Usually have 3 cups a day. 

Starting this week I decided to clean up my diet with less carbs (cutting refined sugar and rice mainly) because i think im pre diabetic and the sugars may be affecting me more than the average person.

Feeling kind of bummed i haven’t cut more after seeing how crazy other guys make it in 12wks. Hoping the diet change really changes the game for me. ",3,1734464540.0,progresspics,1,0.8,False

Now who’s faster is irrelevant as I don’t care about power levels, though I still say Superman is faster just for shits because it makes toxic comic readers angry.

Anyways...about the question “What’s the point of Flash if X character is faster?”

The point of the Flash is that he’s a different character? I mean I don’t think this is hard to understand. Flash is a different character but if there is someone who’s faster than Flash, Flash should disappear and not be in comics anymore. Like he’s some worthless trash whose only personality trait is being the fastest.

But he was also pretty wonderful to me…at times. Made me coffee every morning, tucked me in at night, packed my lunch for work with cute notes. We created private jokes and planned our future. 

The terrible times lasted more than the wonderful ones. I worked so hard for him to let me into his heart and life. 

Three months post-breakup, I feel obsessed and addicted to him. But I don’t know what I miss more -  his love or his abuse. 

If I continued to stay with him, I would have spiraled into addiction. I was drinking way too much, picked up smoking again, and was generally destroying myself over his love. I felt like if I hurt myself enough, he would see that, and work with me. 

So why do I miss him so much? I spend hours pouring over his social media, think about driving by his house, and generally can’t get over him.

>Hey everyone,

>We have a 6-month-old baby, and we’re trying to figure out what to get our parents for Christmas. They’re the type who say they don’t want or need anything—which is sweet, but makes it tough to choose!

>One idea I had: We recently did a photoshoot with our little one, and I was considering getting a nice framed photo or maybe a small album of the best shots. Do you think this would be meaningful enough, or should we consider something more creative?

1hginqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hginqw/aitah_for_still_viewing_trans_women_as_men/,"AITAH for still viewing trans women as men because of my trauma? (TW: mention of SA, CP, CSA)","I'm 22 (F), and I have androphobia, along with PTSD, depression, ED, yada yada, others aren't that relevant. Basically, I'm pretty scared of men. This is because of my childhood experiences. as far as I can remember into my childhood, I've always been assaulted by my dad and his friends, and these assaults would be recorded and sold. I don't remember much from my childhood because of my trauma, but I do know my dad has been caught somehow and executed when I was like 11-12. I don't have a mom, I think she's dead, since I was given to my aunt after my dad died. Or maybe she refused to take me, I don't know.

Anyways, I've been going to therapy since then. My fear used to be so strong that I couldn't use public transportation or go to crowded spaces because any contact with a man, even a bump would send me spiraling. I'm talking breaking down, crying because a man tapped my shoulder to ask for directions. I've improved a lot since then. I still prefer to maintain distance with men and get uncomfortable when they're near. But I can tolerate touch. Can't hold a comfortable, long lasting easy flowing conversation or look into their eyes for more than a second, though. it's tolerable enough for me to be able to live a normal life.

So, I work in an office as an assistant. My boss is a woman who knows of my experiences, and has told my co-workers about this so my male co-workers would avoid interacting with me unless it's necessary. I'm super grateful for this, as it has made my job a lot more easier. I have a couple girl friends in the office who I eat lunch with or go out for coffee after work. 3 weeks ago, We got a new co worker, a trans woman. I'm not transfobic or homophobic, at least I hope I'm not. I've never judged anyone for who they are. despite my experiences, I don't even hate men. But I act towards this new co-worker exactly how I act towards men. She's pretty passing, her face is a little masculine and her voice is deeper than women's, and from what I can see she has a pretty neat personality, she's nice and social. I wanted to be her friend, I really did, but at the first day of her job while meeting her, I made it pretty obvious that I'm uncomfortable. I spoke to her like how I speak to my male co-workers, didn't shake her hand, constantly looked away, mumbled my words. She knew of my condition, so she wasn't offended but she was upset, and the other girls around us who had welcomed her in stared at me judgingly, since it was clear I saw her as a man. I just returned back to my seat after introducing myself. Ever since then, I've been avoiding hanging out with my friends if I knew that she was coming too. 

2 days ago, one of my friends approached me in lunch break and we spoke about this, about how it's not nice of me to view her like that, how I'm putting distance between myself and my friends because she's there. I tried to explain to her that I can't help it and that I know she's a girl but I can't bring myself to be comfortable around her. She left dissapointed. Since that day, I've been feeling bad, and I'm not sure what to do. I have a therapy session in January (I used to go to therapy weekly, I go monthly now since I'm improving) and I do plan on bring this up there, but until then, I was hoping maybe you all could give me advice? Tell me if I'm right, wrong, if it's transfobic of me to view her this way? Thank you for reading.",0,1734463801.0,AITAH,20,0.42,False

What are some interesting careers that might be a good fit for someone in this situation?,"Originally posted this in r/CareerAdvice but thought it might be worthwhile to ask my question here too. Original post below.

\---

First of all, I hope this is the right place for this sort of question. I tried to make sure this was a good place to ask this and to provide the details needed for others to help, but please let me know if you need more information or if there’s a better place for this sort of post.

I am an American man in my early 30s, and I work in an office job in the Supply Chain/Logistics field as a mid-level analyst making in the $80k-90k range per year. There are a lot of things I like about my job. I am very satisfied with my salary and am able to live well above my means due to my lack of major expenses. I also don’t mind sitting at a desk all day; a lot of people who hate corporate jobs say they think sitting in front of a computer all day is “soul sucking” but I personally don’t mind it. I enjoy the structure of an office job and having work to do without having to go out and hunt for it.

What I don’t like about my job, however, is the lack of training, office politics, and always feeling like no matter how hard I work it’s never good enough. I have a boss that is never satisfied with my work, and constantly criticizes me for relatively minor things. I feel like I don’t fully understand some of the work I do, but when I ask for help I get criticized for not knowing it already, leading to a negative feedback loop where I’m damned if I ask for help and damned if I keep my mouth shut and suffer silently. I feel tense whenever I am in the office and am constantly afraid of being criticized. In order to get any recognition I have to be loud and say “look at me, I did this thing” which is not the kind of personality I have. And no matter how good my own work is, if some issue outside of my control happens and brings my numbers down, I am the one who gets blamed for it. All of this leads me to being depressed and anxious, which has other health consequences like a lack of exercise or life outside of work. I get so anxious about work that I can’t eat or sleep. I can’t live like this much longer.

I’m sick of living my life in fear all the time. I feel like this environment is not a healthy fit for me in the long term, and I need a change. I am very seriously considering quitting my job and being unemployed for a period of time. I have about a year’s salary in savings and would be financially ok with being unemployed for a few months. I considered just looking for another job in my field since a lot of my current issues are due to a bad office culture, but I really don’t see a long term future in this career. I would have to go into management to move up, and that’s not something I want to do in a corporate setting.

So now I’m trying to figure out what to do in order to pivot to a new career and lifestyle. I don’t want to quit my job without any sort of plan, but I also know that I have to leave and make a decision soon or else things will get worse for me. I also know that economically, leaving a job is risky right now. My rough idea is to go back to school for something and learn some new skills to make me more marketable but I am trying to get some ideas of what might be a good fit for me. I would really appreciate some advice!



About me:

* I have a BSBA in Computer Information Systems that I never really used due to difficulty finding a job in this field after college. I kind of fell into supply chain and feel stuck in it, but maybe there’s a job in this field that might be a better fit?
* I live in inner-city Chicago and do not own a car. This does somewhat limit my career options as I could not do jobs that requires owning my own car. I also enjoy living in a place where I can live car-free, but would consider giving this up for the right opportunity. Not opposed to moving somewhere else necessarily but it would have to be for the right job.
* I always enjoyed jobs where I help people or get to serve people. My favorite job ever was working at a kava bar in college. It was so fun to get to know the regulars and to make drinks for people while not having to deal with intoxicated people. But it was a minimum wage job and I know that kind of thing wouldn’t be sustainable in the long term. But in the short term, maybe a job like barista, concierge, tour guide, etc. might be a good option?
* I enjoy travel and wouldn’t be opposed to a career that allowed me to travel.
* I’ve always been a more shy person, but I also have thrived in the past in jobs that allow me to communicate with others in an official sort of way (like the bartending job I mentioned earlier)



Some potential jobs that I’ve thought about:

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Seems like an interesting field and my CIS background might make pivoting this direction more feasible, but it seems like advanced maths skills are necessary and math has always been a difficult subject for me in the past. But maybe as an adult it would click with me more than it did as an adolescent?
* Medical field: Nursing is often brought up as a potential option for people trying to leave the corporate world who want to help others. But I do worry about some of the practical aspects of the job (dealing with bodily fluids, watching your patients die, etc.) I also thought a specialized medical job like optometry might be interesting, but going to optometry school would be both time-consuming and expensive.
* Government jobs: I would be willing to take a pay cut to work in a stable government job, but I am worried about this option due to the current political landscape in the US. Without getting into politics, I am aware that the incoming US administration has proposed drastically overhauling the federal government, and I worry that it would make a job working for the government less feasible in the long term. Furthermore, My own city is in a financial crisis right now and municipal hiring is currently frozen.
* Transportation: I’ve considered working for the local transit agency as a bus driver, but I worry about poor work/life balance and not being able to get time off throughout the year. Plus the thought of driving a city bus seems scary to me. I’ve also read about railroad jobs, and it seems like you don’t get social security (they have a separate retirement system) and in many jobs you are always on call 24/7. This seems like a very stressful environment to work in.
* Simply getting another job in my field: Probably the easiest option, but as previously mentioned I don’t think I have a great long-term career prospect if I stay in supply chain. I worry that other companies will have the same issues that my current one has. I’ve worked in a number of corporate jobs at this point and I always feel anxious and like I’m not good enough.
* Starting my own company: I’ve always liked the idea of being a small business owner but the logistics of it always scare me. I’ve met people who left their corporate jobs to become life coaches and things like that, but that doesn’t seem like a good fit for me (I need a therapist/career counselor/life coach/etc myself, how am I supposed to do this for other people?). I have passions like coffee, clothes, etc but I don’t feel confident enough in my abilities to invest tons of my savings into this sort of risky business venture.

If you were in my situation, what kinds of opportunities would you consider as a potential career move? Really appreciate any advice you could give. I feel like I’m at a crossroads in my life and need to make a change, but figuring out the right direction to go is not easy.",1,1734463764.0,findapath,2,1.0,False

I am here because I am finding myself in an odd case of social anxiety with a place I regularly frequent. Some context, I work long hours and often go to a coffee shop in town and have been going about 2-3 times a week since last year. The baristas are so kind and considerate, giving out discounts and sometimes even free drinks to me. I very much enjoy going and am thankful that I can converse with them outside of the usual customer service sphere and just genuinely talk/have conversations. Gonna be honest, pretty sick not gonna lie; an extreme A+ always to my day.

As of late, a lot of things happened in my personal life that are both ailing and overall a heavy weight on my mind. I've been focusing a lot of work along with these personal ailments, but for the moment I am just finding myself not at my full, authentic and social self. I find myself being meticulous with how I act/talk, and because of this I've begun having social anxiety about going back to this regular establishment due to how I am currently.

I am often someone who is lowkey with my anxiety and am capable of regulating it, but for some reason there's been this raging thought that I am, ""not in the right space to converse nor in a place to even get a simple beverage."" Has anyone ever had this kind of thought/feeling before and if so, how did you counteract it? Thank you so much for your time, have a great day!

  
EDIT: I also have been feeling normal with friends/family during this as they've been supporting me throughout some of the personal things. I wanted to add that quickly, thank you!",1,1734463724.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

Dearest reader,

I'm sending you this letter because I saw you lurking on reddit again and wanted to say hi. Specifically to you though, not the other people reading this. No those other people are cool, but I'd rather be avoiding my job today with you. Plus they wouldn't understand our lame humor anyway. And our overly sarcastic way of speaking, even though it doesn't translate well through text. Rarely does it translate well through text.

I know I know, you said you were busy today. You have all those things on your to do list, you should really be focusing right now, and plus you didn't really sleep all that great last night. I get it. But all I'm saying is, take a break for 5 minutes. I know you haven't had enough water yet today, so relax for a sec. I'll even pick you up something for that little coffee shop near by. The aesthetically pleasing one that has just-okay over priced coffee but the place is such a nice vibe and you feel like it's a small victory whenever you can spend money at a local shop instead of going to Starbucks again this week. Yea that place!

We could talk about your day, or your week if you want. Did you wanna vent about that thing your co-worker said that you don't care about anymore but you still care about for some inexplicable reason? Or I could talk if you just want to listen.

But I'm gonna run to the coffee shop now, but remind me. What did you want me to pick you up again?

Three weeks later NP at GI's office started me on a PPI and ordered an endoscopy a few weeks ago as more symptoms appeared but it was completely fine. Went back to see the NP this morning (doc's appointments are months out) and she told me it could not be any kind of reflux (or a Hiatal Hernia) as there was absolutely no evidence in my endoscopy and, if 2 weeks of omeprozole hadn't helped, then I definitely do not have reflux and there was nothing more they could do for me. I even asked if I should come back in a couple of years for a follow up scope in case my symptoms really are acid reflux or silent reflux and she said that insurance wouldn't cover a follow up endoscopy becasue no reflux has been found. She suggested I see an allergist. I'm at a bit of a loss.

So now I’m trying to figure out what to do in order to pivot to a new career and lifestyle. I don’t want to quit my job without any sort of plan, but I also know that I have to leave and make a decision soon or else things will get worse for me. I also know that economically, leaving a job is risky right now. My rough idea is to go back to school for something and learn some new skills to make me more marketable but I am trying to get some ideas of what might be a good fit for me. I would really appreciate some advice!



About me:

* I have a BSBA in Computer Information Systems that I never really used due to difficulty finding a job in this field after college. I kind of fell into supply chain and feel stuck in it, but maybe there’s a job in this field that might be a better fit?
* I live in inner-city Chicago and do not own a car. This does somewhat limit my career options as I could not do jobs that requires owning my own car. I also enjoy living in a place where I can live car-free, but would consider giving this up for the right opportunity. Not opposed to moving somewhere else necessarily but it would have to be for the right job.
* I always enjoyed jobs where I help people or get to serve people. My favorite job ever was working at a kava bar in college. It was so fun to get to know the regulars and to make drinks for people while not having to deal with intoxicated people. But it was a minimum wage job and I know that kind of thing wouldn’t be sustainable in the long term. But in the short term, maybe a job like barista, concierge, tour guide, etc. might be a good option?
* I enjoy travel and wouldn’t be opposed to a career that allowed me to travel.
* I’ve always been a more shy person, but I also have thrived in the past in jobs that allow me to communicate with others in an official sort of way (like the bartending job I mentioned earlier)



Some potential jobs that I’ve thought about:

* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Seems like an interesting field and my CIS background might make pivoting this direction more feasible, but it seems like advanced maths skills are necessary and math has always been a difficult subject for me in the past. But maybe as an adult it would click with me more than it did as an adolescent?
* **Medical field**: Nursing is often brought up as a potential option for people trying to leave the corporate world who want to help others. But I do worry about some of the practical aspects of the job (dealing with bodily fluids, watching your patients die, etc.) I also thought a specialized medical job like optometry might be interesting, but going to optometry school would be both time-consuming and expensive.
* **Government jobs**: I would be willing to take a pay cut to work in a stable government job, but I am worried about this option due to the current political landscape in the US. Without breaking the “No Politics” rule of this subreddit, I am aware that the incoming US administration has proposed drastically overhauling the federal government, and I worry that it would make a job working for the government less feasible in the long term. Furthermore, My own city is in a financial crisis right now and municipal hiring is currently frozen.
* **Transportation**: I’ve considered working for the local transit agency as a bus driver, but I worry about poor work/life balance and not being able to get time off throughout the year. Plus the thought of driving a city bus seems scary to me. I’ve also read about railroad jobs, and it seems like you don’t get social security (they have a separate retirement system) and in many jobs you are always on call 24/7. This seems like a very stressful environment to work in.
* **Simply getting another job in my field**: Probably the easiest option, but as previously mentioned I don’t think I have a great long-term career prospect if I stay in supply chain. I worry that other companies will have the same issues that my current one has. I’ve worked in a number of corporate jobs at this point and I always feel anxious and like I’m not good enough.
* **Starting my own company**: I’ve always liked the idea of being a small business owner but the logistics of it always scare me. I’ve met people who left their corporate jobs to become life coaches and things like that, but that doesn’t seem like a good fit for me (I need a therapist/career counselor/life coach/etc myself, how am I supposed to do this for other people?). I have passions like coffee, clothes, etc but I don’t feel confident enough in my abilities to invest tons of my savings into this sort of risky business venture. 

If you were in my situation, what kinds of opportunities would you consider as a potential career move? Really appreciate any advice you could give. I feel like I’m at a crossroads in my life and need to make a change, but figuring out the right direction to go is not easy.",2,1734462849.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

1hgi85p,https://i.redd.it/h6gh6whzjg7e1.jpeg,CawfeeSquak: snark post of Today’s thriving Chronicles. ☕️,"003,-1:54:
KCL has been through it trying to make this video happen. Between wrangling internet, coffee and what I assume is an unnecessary amount of emotional labor, Beasley decides to make things harder. 
Yes, Beasley, the four-legged tyrant who thinks the world revolves around him. Needy? Check. Clingy? Check. Santa sweater and crate-bound? Double check. Honestly, does he even know who she is? There are deadlines to meet, Beasley. This isn’t a Hallmark movie, and no one’s waiting for your redemption arc.
1:00 - 1:54:
Meanwhile, John’s doing his best impression of a supportive  husband He’s following KCL through Big Lots like a knight trailing behind royalty. Smart move, really. He knows where his bread is buttered (and his ego stroked). There’s no mystery here—his role in this dynamic is clear: royal entourage.

But, let’s not forget, this is the guy who proposed the first weekend they met. Romantic or red flag? You decide. For now, he’s making life easier for the reigning queen of Big Lots content creation. At least he’s consistent

2:03 - 2:06:
It’s that time of year again when KCL reigns supreme as the undisputed party queen. She’s got it all—charcuterie boards that probably cost more than your electric bill, butter mints displayed like they’re art, fresh flowers everywhere (of course), and cookies that look like they were baked by angels. Truly, she’s the modern-day Martha Stewart, minus the prison stint (so far).

But wait! KCL has a life hack to share with us lowly commoners. You know all those leftover artisan cheeses from your fabulous parties? You can use them to make… grilled cheese sandwiches. Revolutionary, isn’t it? She’s really out here dropping gems, like we didn’t already figure out how to slap some cheese between two slices of bread in hard times.

Did she actually say this? I mean, I thought she was a rich bitch with bespoke taste. Isn’t she above the peasant food tier? But hey, credit where it’s due—she’s trying to relate. Bless her heart. Even if she’s subtly reminding us that our sad Kraft singles could never!
3:16
KCL has an announcement, everyone. Please pause your mediocre lives and lean in. Her body is feeling neutral. And in KCL-speak, that’s code for thriving. She wants us all to know—Patty, Mia, and the goons especially—that she is, in fact, doing just fine, thank you very much.

6:19:
Gather ’round, because KCL has a little flex disguised as an announcement. Turns out, she knows other content creators. Yes, real ones. And one of these illustrious friends—who we all vaguely remember from her last channel—is hosting a free anxiety/trauma class on January 1st. Free? In this economy? Revolutionary.

But wait, there’s more! Guess who’s snagging a front-row seat like the overachiever she is? That’s right—KCL herself. Because why wouldn’t she attend? It’s an opportunity to not-so-subtly remind us that her network is far superior to ours.

Don’t be fooled, though—she’s not just a participant. This is about showing up and letting the world know she’s still the queen bee of whatever hive she’s created. A new year, a free class, and yet another reason for KCL to make everything about her. Classic

6:46
And we’re back to Mr. Beasley, the four-legged pissant who refuses to stay in his lane. Just when KCL thinks she can focus on her content queen duties, Beasley starts acting like, well... a dog. The audacity.

He’s in his crate—rambunctious, restless, probably plotting his next move—and poor KCL just can’t. She has no choice but to interrupt her very important influencer moment to deal with him. Imagine being KCL, trying to thrive in neutrality while your Santa sweater-clad mutt is staging a rebellion.

Honestly, it’s giving “diva energy,” but we all know who the real diva in this house is (spoiler: it’s not KCL). Let’s hope Beasley cools it long enough for her to remind us how relatable she is again.",13,1734462658.0,KCL_Detention_center,10,1.0,False

====================================

Ah, the familiar smell of a wet dog mixing with something slightly… off. If you're a dog owner, you've probably noticed that your furry friend can sometimes have a breath that could knock a skunk off its feet! You might be wondering, ""What is the cause of dog bad breath?"" Well, don’t worry; you’re not alone in this smelly conundrum. Just like humans, dogs are susceptible to bad breath, or halitosis, as it’s more formally known. While a little stink might seem harmless, it could indicate deeper health issues lurking beneath the surface.

In this extensive guide, we'll delve into the various factors contributing to canine breath woes. From dental dilemmas to dietary disasters, there’s a plethora of potential culprits. So grab your favorite beverage, settle in, and let’s tackle this pungent puzzle together!

The Importance of Oral Hygiene for Dogs
---------------------------------------

When it comes to keeping your pup healthy and happy, oral hygiene should be high on your list of priorities. Just as we brush our teeth to prevent cavities and maintain fresh breath, dogs also need proper dental care. In fact, poor oral hygiene is one of the leading causes of bad breath in dogs.

**Why is Dental Care Crucial?**

- **Prevent Gum Disease:** Plaque builds up on teeth over time, leading to tartar, gum inflammation, and even periodontal disease.
- **Bacterial Growth:** When your dog’s mouth hosts unhealthy bacteria, it can produce foul-smelling compounds that make even the heartiest among us gag.
- **Overall Health Impact:** Poor dental hygiene doesn’t just affect the mouth; it can lead to serious health issues, including infections that may spread to vital organs like the heart and kidneys.

Neglecting your dog's dental health is like ignoring a ticking time bomb—eventually, it’s going to go off. Regular vet visits and daily brushing can save you from future headaches (and nose pinches!).

Common Causes of Dog Bad Breath
-------------------------------

So, what is the cause of dog bad breath? There are several common reasons for this olfactory offense. Let’s take a closer look at some of the usual suspects.

### 1. Dental Disease

Dental disease is often the primary culprit behind your pup's stinky breath. It’s estimated that by age three, about 80% of dogs show signs of oral disease. That’s a jaw-dropping statistic!

- **Tartar and Plaque Buildup:** Food particles mix with saliva and bacteria, forming a sticky film on the teeth. If not removed, it hardens into tartar—a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.
- **Periodontal Disease:** As tartar builds up, it can lead to gum disease, which is painful and can cause further complications if left untreated.

### 2. Diet Matters

What goes in must come out—and that includes your dog's diet. Some foods simply don’t sit well with canine digestive systems, leading to an unpleasant aroma wafting from their jaws.

- **Low-Quality Ingredients:** Cheaper dog foods often contain fillers and artificial ingredients that can lead to an imbalance in gut health.
- **Strong Smelling Treats:** Certain treats, particularly those made with fish or other pungent proteins, can result in doggy breath that could clear a room.

### 3. Medical Conditions

Sometimes, bad breath might be a signal that something more serious is going on with your furry friend’s health.

- **Kidney Disease:** A urine-like odor might indicate kidney problems, as toxins build up in the body.
- **Diabetes:** Sweet-smelling breath can be a sign of diabetes, particularly if accompanied by excessive thirst and urination.
- **Respiratory Infections:** Sinus or throat infections can lead to bad breath due to mucus buildup.

If your dog’s breath suddenly turns horrid or is accompanied by other symptoms, it’s definitely worth a trip to the vet.

### 4. Oral Tumors

While not as common, tumors in the mouth can contribute to foul odors. These can be benign or malignant and can significantly impact your dog's health. Monitoring for lumps and bumps during your pup's routine check-ups is key.

### 5. Breeds and Bad Breath

Some breeds are more prone to bad breath than others, thanks to their physical structure and predilection for dental issues.

- **Brachycephalic Breeds:** Pugs, Bulldogs, and Boston Terriers have short muzzles, making their oral health a bit more challenging.
- **Small Breeds:** Tiny dogs like Chihuahuas and Yorkies often experience dental problems due to smaller mouths and less room for teeth.

### 6. Lack of Chewing

You know how satisfying it can be to chew on a piece of gum or munch some crunchy snacks? Well, dogs benefit from that, too! Chewing helps naturally clean their teeth and gums.

- **Chew Toys:** Providing your pooch with dental chews can help reduce plaque and tartar buildup.
- **Raw Bones:** Raw bones can be an excellent natural toothbrush for dogs. Just be cautious and consult with your vet before you toss any bones their way.

How to Combat Bad Breath
------------------------

Now that we've examined what causes dog bad breath, let’s pivot to solutions! After all, nobody wants to deal with a four-legged friend who's got a breath like a garbage truck. Here are effective strategies for freshening up your pup’s pearly whites.

### 1. Regular Dental Check-ups

Just like you'd visit the dentist for cleanings, your dog needs regular vet check-ups focused on oral health. This can help catch problems before they turn into full-blown crises.

### 2. Daily Brushing

It's not as daunting as it sounds! With the right tools and patience, you can make brushing your dog’s teeth a breeze.

- **Use Dog-Specific Toothpaste:** Human toothpaste can be toxic to dogs. Always select a formula made specifically for them.
- **Create a Routine:** Brush at the same time every day—maybe while the kettle's boiling for your morning coffee. Reward them afterward to reinforce positive behavior.

### 3. Chew Toys and Dental Treats

Invest in chew toys designed to promote dental health. Many of these products are specifically engineered to reduce tartar and keep breath fresh.

### 4. Monitor Diet

Be mindful of what goes into your furry companion's bowl. Look for high-quality dog food that’s free of unnecessary fillers and additives.

- **Introduce Fresh Foods:** Incorporating vegetables like carrots can not only provide nutrition but also assist in scraping away plaque while your dog chews.

### 5. Stay Hydrated

Ensuring your dog has constant access to fresh water can help wash away food fragments and bacteria contributing to bad breath.

### 6. Visit the Vet

If you've tried everything and your dog's breath still resembles a dumpster diver’s, it’s time to consult with a professional. Your vet can identify underlying health issues and, if necessary, recommend specialized dental cleaning.

The Emotional Aspect of Bad Breath
----------------------------------

Let’s face it: beyond the physical discomfort bad breath can cause your dog, there’s an emotional factor, too. It can create social barriers for both you and your pet.

- **Playdates:** No pup wants to be the one who keeps getting turned down for playdates because their breath smells like something died.
- **Vet Visits:** Bad breath can signal underlying health issues that require immediate attention, so it’s never something to ignore.

Being a responsible dog owner means fully embracing your role in your dog’s health journey—breath included!

Conclusion
----------

So, now you’re armed with knowledge about what is the cause of dog bad breath. From dental disease to dietary impacts, there’s a myriad of factors that can contribute to your dog’s less-than-fresh breath. The good news? Many of these issues can be managed or even prevented with proper dental care and regular vet visits.

By being proactive and attentive, you can ensure your canine companion's breath is more “hugs and cuddles” instead of “why did I walk into that?”

Remember, a dog’s love is truly unconditional, but their breath doesn’t have to be! Keep an eye on their oral hygiene, and you’ll both be smiling (and smelling) brighter in no time.

I know many of you have been looking at the Acaia Lunar but hate its price tag. Rightly so. Having used the ARC for a few weeks, I can tell you this scale is of very similar quality. In fact, I think it's a better scale. It's wider to fit two cups, its display is larger and brighter. Other features include: live flow rate right on the display, phone app for more granular flow data, a metal construction, large battery compared to my other scales, good water resistance, and an actually helpful auto-espresso mode.

I really like this thing so far, but I cannot speak on its longevity yet since I've only had it a few weeks. I actually picked up two because I imported one a while back.

I need to get this off my chest so this is part vent and part talking about the issues of the gacha. Let me preface a few things: I'm a former Love Nikki player (played a bit of Shining Nikki as well), I've played Genshin and currently on a break from HSR. So gacha is not new to me, nor is Infold's aggressive monetisation. I do however think there's a big flaw with Infinity Nikki's gacha that's need some reworking.

So I'm F2P and been grinding hard for the resonance stones, I did 180 pulls and I'm 1 piece away from completing the outfit. I'm sure, you all are aware of the fact you can claim a recolour at 180 pulls. I claimed it but do not have it in the recolour in my inventory because I do not have the main outfit.

I- \*sigh\*, I'm soo pissed at this! Whoever thought it was a good idea to have a worst case scenario pity be between 180-200 pulls needs to have their cat claw their face and spill coffee on their white shirt!

If the player have hit 180 pity or 200 pity, and need a main outfit to claim the recolours but don't have it. It's a very studid gacha system! IMO people want the main outfit first and foremost. Logically, speaking you'd think people should be getting that first. The recolours would be for daring F2P, low-spenders or whales. I think they need to rework this! The maximum pity should be at 180 where the 1st recolour is or at 160, making 160 and forward just for the recolours. Point is they need to make it so people getting the main outfit is the priority and recolours something people want to attempt at, or splurge.

To anyone who reads this, please remember to put gacha rework into the survey!

Hi everyone,

I built **First2Apply**, an open-source job board aggregator that helps you find and apply for jobs faster by pulling listings from multiple sources like LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice, and more—all in one place.

**Why I built this:**

When I was job hunting, I found it tedious to track postings across multiple platforms. So I created a tool that:

• **Scrapes jobs** from major job boards.

• **Filters results** based on your criteria (even leveraging AI with ChatGPT).

• **Sends alerts** when new opportunities match your interests.



**MacOS Support:**

• Designed to work seamlessly on **MacOS**.

• Built with **Electron** for a native-like experience.

**Tech Stack:**

Electron | Supabase | TypeScript | React | Tailwind | Shadcn

  
It’s open-source, and I’d love your feedback or contributions. Check it out on GitHub:

The class was awful and did not prepare you for the basic fundamentals of being a firefighter. I dropped from RCA a year or so back, but they were trying to teach job roles one would not receive for years and were not applicable to the basic certifications of being a firefighter. I say that now being a certified firefighter after attending Davis Tech. At Davis, they showed students empathy while also pushing us to become a better version of ourselves. They taught the importance of hard work and discipline but didn't push you to the point of injury. They made sure you were ready for the evolutions and training ahead. At the RCA, all that was focused on was speed. Even on the first day of class, speed in getting in the turnouts and in the physical tests is all they cared about. They would scream in your face for no apparent reason other than to try and get a rise out of you or discourage you. The physical aspect was difficult, I was extremely fit at the time. I had around a 6:40 mile time. Decent bench and squat numbers. They would push you past the point of physical exhaustion, and not allow for a break to even drink water. There was days my pee would be coffee brown or I wouldn't urinate at all. If you want to pay $5,000 to be treated like you just joined bootcamp, be my guest but I cannot recommend this program to anyone. It was borderline abusive and was a terrible education experience compared to other classes. You will experience this if you go to a job sponsored fire academy as well, but atleast there you're getting paid and on there health insurance if they cause injury. ",4,1734461560.0,UVU,2,0.75,False

1hghrrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1hghrrd/how_to_professionally_tell_someone_to_f_off_after/,How to professionally tell someone to F off after asking me for a letter of rec ,"For context, about 4 months ago I was fired for undisclosed reasons. However, I maintained some very good friendships with some of my former colleges a few of which, are in the exec board. We are a fairly small company and “secrets” are very hard to keep. 

After I was fired I was searching for answers due to the complete blindside of being let go. I was a top contributor in the company, never had any write ups or reprimands. 

A while ago, I was informed that my assist was essentially the reason I was let go. She was upset that she was “in charge of too many things” and yet she also was upset that she was not “in charge of enough.” 

She also felt that I did not contribute to the “group effort” after my role changed to being strictly a manager. Now, this was a manager position of manual labor positions. I did continue to do some work outside of the office but had to cut back significantly as my roles and duties changed and they required me to do about 80% office work while before I was doing a rough 50/50 split. 

She was not happy with this and said that I was being “lazy” and I felt as if I was only there to “tell them what to do.” 

I found out she had been emailing every upset she had with me to HR as well as getting some of the other part Time staff to email in fake complaints as well. 

One of the complaints, I kid you not, was that I brought In coffee and never offered to bring them any. Can’t even make it up. 

HR never came to talk to me about any of the complaints nor was there any formal write ups for any of the things I was being accused of. All of which, were false. 

Things peaked the day before I was fired as she came into the office screaming at me and telling me I was a terrible manager, calling me other names, and she wanted me gone or all of the part time staff and her would quit. (A total of 5 people). All of this was heard by another manager of a different department. 

I was fired the next day. She still works there. 

Fast forward to now. She is in grad school. She is apparently registering for classes for next semester. One class is for working students in the related field to do special course work. 

She emailed me asking for a letter of rec for the class because part of the requirements is that she needs a letter of rec from a direct supervisor that oversaw her for a minimum of 2 years.  I am the only one she has had for that long of time. 

I do not feel that I can give her an honest recommendation given what I know. There were also many problems in the past with her that included write ups and action plans. She was never fired due to the number of hoops that company makes you go through to fire someone. But believe me, myself and my manager, tried. 

So how do I tell her no but also making it clear why I won’t while maintaining a professional manner? 

Sorry for the long post. I have been a manager at multiple companies over the last 10 years and I have never worked with anyone who I would not write a letter of rec before. All of my employees have been amazing people and I have never had any issues with anyone up til now. ",38,1734461493.0,askmanagers,74,0.91,False

Immediately across the street from me was a business whose property was bought by a developer early last year. The developer let the business stay as a tenant in the building until this summer, and then moved them out. I now have had a large commercial building sitting empty directly across from my house for several months.. 

Around August, an array of people took note that it was vacant and began to tear it apart. Graffiti, people stealing scrap metal, local teens destroying stuff, drugs, unhoused people staying there, illegal dumping in the parking lots, everything you can imagine. All doors of the building are wide open, windows smashed, 0 security. I brought up concerns with the developer and nothing. I escalated to my city councilman and made a case with codes. Between every re-inspection the past few months the developer has not been by the property even once. Needless to say they failed all of them, and are now going to be fined by the city until they clean it up/secure it. However, I know they plan to demolish eventually and they paid over $10 million for the lot. Paying the $50/day fine for the violation is much easier/cheaper than cleaning it up.

This has really affected my family’s quality of life in our home. We get approached by people in our own front yard, get kept up at night by sounds (including several instances of gunshots), and overall it just sucks to look at. My main concern is safety though. I did reach out to the local police and they said they’ll do more patrols around our neighborhood, but who knows what will happen. My question is if I have a tangible claim against this developer to take them to court? My #1 priority is getting it cleaned up asap, but could I be eligible for some sort of settlement to make it worth my time and troubles as well? 

For more background, they plan to build mixed use apartments on the site. However, the earliest start date is 2027 and I don’t want to deal with this nuisance until then. I am NOT against the development. They actually needed a re-zoning on the lot for it and I wrote a letter in favor of it to the city council. I got along with the guys at the old business great, but the actual business was somewhat industrial and not useful to a consumer like me.

You can select as many of (or none) of the items you would like, and the payout for each item will be paid per the terms of the item.  After selection of the items, they will be set for life, you will never have the chance to undo or reverse the selections.

Money will be paid automatically into your account at the end of each year.  The money will never be questioned by any individual or organization, although people around you are likely to notice and comment on your bad luck.



# BAD LUCK MENU ITEMS

1. **Toe stubbing (payout: $20k/year)**
   1. *You will stub your toe several times a week for the rest of your life (no matter how careful you are, this will happen).  Each time will be painful, but the pain will pass.  Even though you will stub your toe so frequently, you will suffer no permanent physical damage.*
2. **Drink spilling (payout: $15k/year)**
   1. *You will spill your drink 30% of the time.  Could be small spills, like you miss your mouth.  Could be larger spills, like tip over coffee in your lap.  Frequency is random, nothing you can do to prevent it.*
3. **Bad hair (payout: $10k/year)**
   1. *A few times a week, you will have a bad hair day.  This is different for every person, if you want straight hair, some of it is curly.  If you want curly, maybe it is straight.  If you are a man, maybe you have an alfalfa spike that won't stay down.  You can cover it up, but you cannot fix it on a bad hair day.  If you are bald, maybe your eyebrows get bushy or grow together.* 
4. **Spoiled milk (payout: $10k/year)**
   1. *A few times a month, your milk will smell/tasted spoiled/sour.  If you don't drink milk, the taste will come through in something with a milk product in it (e.g. cream in coffee, or cream-based sauce).  The item will be fine for everyone else.  No health risks with consuming it, it is just gross.*
5. **Minor car accident (payout: $20k/year)**
   1. *A few times a year you will have a minor car accident.  No one will be injured, but minor vehicle damage will occur...results could be time consuming and inconvenient.  Occurrences will be random and are not necessarily your fault.* 
6. **Cold food (payout: $15k/year)**
   1. *Roughly half the time you get food from a restaurant your food will be served cold.  Everyone else food will be fine.  If the food is supposed to be cold, great!  Sending the food back will result in the same experience for you, the cold food sticks for the whole dining meal.  Others with you, if testing your food, will perceive it as good temperature. Eating the cold food is not a health concern.*
7. **Technology failure (payout: $15k/year)**
   1. *Approximately once a month you will experience a technology failure.  Will not be anything catastrophic (e.g. phone explodes), but will usually last a day.  Failure could be: cell phone battery dies much earlier than normal, internet connection is lost for some time, website you need/want to access is down, etc.  Only you experience the failure.*
8. **Body Odor (payout: $15k/year)**
   1. Approximately one day per month you will have body odor that you can't smell.  Doesn't matter if you shower and put on deodorant, you cannot fix it for that day. 
9. **Traffic (payout: $15k/year)**
   1. A few times a week you will have traffic issues.  Don't drive?  Your uber/taxi will have delays.  Someone will breakdown in front of you at a stoplight.  Road construction will detour your route.

  
What do you select and why?

\*Bonus points for providing feedback if the pricing/items seemed fair.  Didn't want this to be a ""you get a billion $ for being inconvenienced"" kind of thing. 

\*Extra bonus points if there are other BAD LUCK MENU ITEMS that you would have included for a price.

Close your eyes and relive it, like a mental highlight reel. Feel the gratitude you felt back then as if it’s happening again.


2. Gratitude for the Present

Now focus on right now. What’s something you’re grateful for this second? (Even small things count: the taste of your coffee, the fact you’re alive, the internet being free.)

Let that gratitude simmer for a minute.


3. Gratitude for the Future

Now imagine your future self. Picture something you really, really want—your dream job, a healthier you, whatever.

Imagine it’s already happened. You’re living it. How does it feel? Who’s there with you? What’s the vibe? Feel the gratitude for that future reality as if it’s 100% real.

4. Anchor It in Your Body

Here’s the wild part: While you’re visualizing, put your hand on your chest or belly and take deep breaths. Let that gratitude sink deep into your nervous system.

And boom—this simple practice rewires your brain to expect good things, focus on abundance, and let go of negative energy. It’s like tricking your brain into believing everything’s already amazing.

I had also weird allergic reactions, my face was on fire - I had been recently diagnosed with POTS which it seems I always had, but COVID worsen. My allergist put me on ebastine which helped tremendously, and if you can get it from your dr, I really advise on it. But whilst on ebastine, or after it I can't recall, my dr recommend me to get on probiotics, which have always been a bit difficult for me cause they very easily give me the poops even though I had always being a very constipated gal but suddenly became a immediate poop fire kinda girlypop.

11 nights from Chase consumer card, 10 from Chase business, others from stays as below; only just requalifying for Globalist at 60 for the year.

**Grand Hyatt Doha**

Nice enough for a family stay, upgraded to a standard suite based on a SUA, it smelled funny at check-in but they brought in some kind of ozone machines or something. Basically in the middle of nowhere, but taxis are cheap. The lounge has decent happy hour that we used as dinner 2 or 3 three times on a six-night stay. Staff were super helpful and friendly, would stay again in similar circumstances.

**Regency Oryx Doha**

Wife and step-daughter left Doha the night before I did, so I bounced to here. Really friendly, happened to be there the same time as our home-country football team (for the Asia Cup), staff encouraged us to hang around the lobby till they showed up so we could take photos. Lounge decent enough for a light dinner. Not much to speak of nearby but easy metro access to airport and museum.

**Regency DFW**

Awful location amidst the terminals. Stay in the Grand instead.

**Regency Kathmandu**

Run down a bit, but nice staff and decent lounge happy hour offering. Breakfast is generous but busy. The best reason to stay is the back-door access to Boudhanath, the second-best reason is the little Bhutanese restaurant out the back gate to the right.

**Place Dubai Al Rigga**

Very busy, hard to find a spot for breakfast, but great for quick airport access and a short walk to Al Rigga metro. This must be the 5th time I've stayed here, and I'll stay again.

**Regency Kinabalu**

Excellent location, decent lounge, nice voucher for ice cream at the coffee shop.  Would stay again.

**Andaz Singapore**

Had an expiring FNC to burn before a multi-night stay at the Intercontinental nearby. The pool has a nice view, and some of the rooms have a creepy view onto the red lights of the Atlas Shrugged building next door. Breakfast has a spectacular selection, though it's quite busy. The funny lounge concept feels like a miss for me. The location (with metro station access in the basement) is unbeatable.

**Alila Bangsar**

The location is soso, but you're taking Grab everywhere so who cares. Good breakfast, great pool views, unbeatable value as a C1.

**Regency Houston Downtown**

Hotel is fine, location is ok, breakfast quality is good but service is poor. Let's be honest, it's a Cat2 in a major US city; you're staying for value more than experience.

**Place Houston/Katy**

It's the kind of place you stay on a work trip. Katy Chinatown is a few minutes away with amazing restaurants. Hotel breakfast is actually fairly decent for a US Place - they even have a taco bar.

**House Bryan/College Station**

Staff are too friendly in the way that only US hotels (/customer service) are. We had a long and unnecessary conversation about my luggage, which none of us wanted to be the first to exit for fear of appearing impolite. Location is only convenient if you have a car, but it's the US so of course you will.

**Grand Hyatt Istanbul**

I've stayed here so many times. Breakfast service is overbearingly solicitous for Globalists, but everything else is great. Decent lounge happy hour, but skip it and go have dinner somewhere in the city.

**Regency Bishkek**

Mattress run to requalify for Globalist. Food quality is fairly poor, though the lounge happy hour was better than expected based on other previous food experiences. The sauna and fitness center are nice, but the jacuzzi is a sad small tub stapled onto the other offerings. Location is great for Bishkek, especially if you've got tickets to the Opera/Ballet next door.

Currently booked for next year, regarding which I welcome any feedback:

Regency Tokyo (using an expiring C4 FNC)

UrCove Beijing Forbidden City (visa-free layover)

Regency Sofia (wife birthday trip)

Andaz Vienna (romantic getaway before...)

I got into another relationship with M21 about 6 months later. This relationship lasted a little less than a year. We ended on good terms and have been good friends since. We knew we just weren’t compatible for each other relationship wise. We hangout frequently and I know he still has feelings for me. I recently ran into my ex of 3 years at the gym. We had a really good talk about everything and talked about how immature we were. He asked me to get coffee and catch up so we could talk about everything. Our breakup was very traumatic for me so talking about everything would be very helpful for me. However my ex of 1 year and is upset about it and doesn’t even think I should be talking to him. I told him that I have no intentions of anything besides talking but I still feel really guilty. I will admit that me and M21 spend too much time together for being exes. I just still would like to be friends with him and I know if i become even more distant he will no longer be friends with me. I just don’t want to feel controlled anymore. I’m sure the right decision would be to stop talking to him but I’m really not sure. ,1,1734460281.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

Every single employee deserves a giant raise and a life size bottle of vodka or wine for dealing with what we had to put up with this weekend. At my store our bopis was absolutely chaotic, staying at over 100 orders for my 7 hour shift on Sunday, when we were repeatedly filling them. I want to thank anyone who was working on register even though you probably didn’t want to even step foot behind register (speaking for myself here) and those who were filling out bopis left and right. You all deserve more recognition and respect than we are given and I just want to take a moment to shout out every single one of yall. 

To everyone who got yelled at, complained to, screamed at, belittled, insulted and all of the above, I want you all to know you are very much appreciated by everyone around you and me, the gal from Texas who feels at a loss for words at how terrible this weekend was. We should never have to put up with such behavior and entitlement and never in my 3 years of working here have seen such behavior happen or seen it get as bad as it did this weekend ever. Not even candle day could hold a flame to how bad it was. Black Friday was a tea party compared to this. So to everyone who wants to pull out their hair and scream into their pillow, I just want you to know you are loved and appreciated. 

Now to the customers. To the ones who were so patient, kind and respectful thank you so much for acting your age and just understanding the pain of what we were going through. To everyone who had to wait in long lines and never muttered a single complaint or comment about how our stores looked like an active warzone and how we were out of their favorite products, thank you. You guys were the ones that made us hold on to our sanity during this weekend. 

Now to the ones who probably won’t see this or read this, the ones who were absolutely God awful, impatient and entitled customers. When it comes to bopis during the holiday season, if you haven’t receive an email saying it is ready, DO NOT come to the store expecting it to be filled just because you’re there. The amount of times I had to do that this weekend because someone drove all the way here and they placed the order this morning at 4AM and it’s now 2PM it saying it should be ready was sickening. If it wasn’t December, during one of our most shopped days, and we weren’t short staffed running off of coffee, energy drinks, and the hope of getting off at decent time, we would have it filled within 2-4 hours as the app says. But unfortunately it is the holiday season and it means our stores get busier than normal. 
If we don’t have the item your looking for on the shelves or tables please don’t look in the under stock of our drawers, especially the bunker drawers that have stacks of candles on them and shift at the slightest gust of wind. It’s for your safety and ours if you don’t do that. If you need something, ask! We are here to help and assist you. 

Again thank you to all who worked this weekend everywhere, this girl from Texas is grateful for all of you who put in the work and did absolutely amazing this weekend. You all deserve the world right now and are getting very little attention and support from corporate so I just wanted you to know that this associate, appreciates you.

This promotion would come with a good pay raise, which is great. 

However, it also comes with a permanent schedule change. 

Right now, he's on afternoons so he works 2pm to 10pm. The new schedule would shift him to mornings and he'd be working 8am to 4pm. 

That shift fucks the entire routine/schedule I follow for myself. 

Currently, I get up at 745/8am, make us both coffee, wake him up, make toast or whatever for breakfast, by 820 I go wake up the toddler and get her changed. Bring her to the livingroom, do the morning asthma puffer. I generally make her breakfast and set her up with it before I go to work at 9. 

After that shes with her dad until 1ish when he brings her to the sitter. 

I finish work at 530. I come out of the home office and clean the kitchen/do dishes/think about what I'm making for supper. If toddler gets dropped off before I'm done cleaning, I get her in her highchair with supper while I finish up. 

I get into pj's and make a warm bottle for 730 to get her in bed for 8 and then I tidy the toys and what not in the livingroom and then I get around 30 minutes to relax before I have to cook supper. 

With the new schedule, I'd have to wake up at like 6am to make sure husband is up, have the baby up by 730 so she can be picked up by 8am. 

He'd already be home when I get off work, so that shifts supper to much much earlier. So that means I'm cleaning and cooking and trying to get toddler fed at the same time and supper will end up being ready right about when I would usually put the toddler to bed. So that's going to push her bedtime back unless I want cold food. 

It's just a whole pain in my ass basically and takes all the responsibility with her off his plate because he no longer has like 4ish hours alone with her during the day.",2,1734459579.0,breakingmom,7,0.67,False
1hggzpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBaking/comments/1hggzpd/tiramisu_asking_advice_on_instant_coffee_powder/,Tiramisu... asking advice on instant coffee powder.,"Hi everyone!

I am making tiramisu for christmas, but I am not a coffee drinker, so I always struggle when it comes to getting the coffee flavor right.

Since, as I stated, I rarely drink coffee, I don't have any equipment in the house for making coffee, so I will be using instant coffee powder (not esspresso, as stated in many recipes), since that is what I have on hand.

Can anyone give me any directs of how much water + instant coffee powder I will need to make 250 ml strong coffee?

I am also interested in how much I would need if in the future I can find instant esspresso powder OR if I would make regular strong brewed coffee.

In the past I tried making regular strong coffee with a cheesecloth, but it either came out WAY too strong or too weak.",5,1734459488.0,VeganBaking,2,1.0,False
1hggz08,https://i.redd.it/d7orooleag7e1.jpeg,First day at the range,"Not much substance here, just excited to start my progresaband some initial impressions. Got my FID recently so took my first trip to the range to try out some guns.

Range I went to was nice, despite having a black rifle coffee in it, it wasnt overtly political. Lots of RSO around. I have some experience with 22 rifles but never shot a handgun before so I got the introduction lesson thing and the guy was great, super patient. Started me off with a single bullet and then worked up. instructive but not pedantic.Good stuff.

Started with a G19 which was fine.  Nothing earth shattering but it worked well for me. Ergonomics were fine. 

From there I tried a hellcat pro. Wanted to try the echelon c but they didn't have it. Ergonomics it felt nicer than the g19 but it was a bit snappy for me.

G43x felt really nice. Felt nicer than the G19 but not quite as comfy as the hellcat. Shooting felt the best. 

Finished off with the VP9 full size since they didn't have the compact. Felt nice, shot pretty good but seemed a bit oversized for me.

Still want to go try more guns. Really want to try the cz P10c but they didn't have it for rent. 

Itbwas my first time at an indoor range and the pops definitely surprised me. More so the vibration than the noise. It wasn't too bad though and I had double ear pro.

Feel like I did pretty well. 50 rounds in an hour. Only 1 shot with the VP9 felt like I didn't come close to the target. Was a bit of a confidence boost when I put a round almost exactly in the RSOs shot on my first shot ever.",23,1734459437.0,liberalgunowners,1,0.96,False

# Highlighted answers

11. What purpose does the target serve to the group? (24)

All targets are important in terms of: rallying groups (i.e. “winning” the game), providing activities, recruiting new members, keeping existing members in line (by example), making a statement to the community. Some are a source of financial revenue.

12. How are targets identified? (16)

Broadcasts on right wing radio stations, Internet, Print articles, Public meetings. The group members are not acting under the direct orders of anyone – i.e. leaders identify targets, but it is up to followers to decide what to do about them.

13. What are the group’s objectives?

To harass the target constantly. (32)  
To provoke any reaction. (43)  
To make sure the target knows he is being watched (also known as ”sensitizing” the target). (32)  
To try and find ways of making the target interact with them (regardless of whether a target is taking the garbage out in the morning, driving to work or sitting in a local coffee shop). Ideally, a target will not be able to go anywhere in public without having to deal with them in some way. (37)  
To destroy a person’s life by attacking the weakest point, which could include a spouse, children or elderly relatives. (47)

14. How do they achieve their objectives?

Many tactics are tried and the result is observed. (32). Those which evoke a response from the target are repeated. (32) They discuss among themselves whether or not the target has been sensitized (i.e. made aware of the stalkers). (43)

Other tactics:

Controlling the target’s time, including: (42) Speeding across town in a convoy of vehicles so group members can stand in line ahead of a target for the sole purpose of trying to keep him waiting as long as possible. (37/42), Blocking a target from leaving a parking space. (42)Controlling a target’s speed on a highway by surrounding him with slow moving vehicles. (42/45) Causing problems which force the target to solve them, like gluing his car doors shut. (45) Creating a puzzle for the target to solve. The target is invited to waste his time following bogus clues and leads. (45) Imposing a system of rewards and punishments on a target for: (42) Communicating and associating with other people. Laughing at or assaulting group members.

21. What about the Police?

Groups have no respect for the law or for those who enforce it. (45) They consider themselves to be superior to the Police, partially because of the crimes they get away with. (45) Groups take pride that they never quit. Actually, they do, but it takes a long intensive effort by the Police. (45) In small towns, the number of members in these groups can easily exceed the number of Police officers. (48) Groups claim that they have the support of some Police officers. If so, it is not many. (50) Most Police officers, except those in the South, are not familiar with the way groups operate. (50) In general, the Police will not talk about stalking groups. (48) One officer did say that there is a storm brewing as groups become larger and more numerous. (48) When approaching the police, it is necessary to speak with officers who handle extremist groups. (50)

22. The Use of “Coercive Persuasion” to control cult members

Coercion is defined as, ""to restrain or constrain by force..."". Legally it often implies the use of physical force, or physical or legal threat. This traditional concept of coercion is far better understood than the technological concepts of ""coercive persuasion"" which are effective restraining, impairing, or compelling through the gradual application of psychological forces. (37) Over time, coercive persuasion, a psychological force akin in some ways to our legal concepts of undue influence, can be even more effective than pain, torture, drugs, and use of physical force and legal threats. (38) With coercive persuasion you can change people's attitudes without their knowledge and volition. (38)

The advances in the extreme anxiety and emotional stress production technologies found in coercive persuasion supersede old style coercion that focuses on pain, torture, drugs, or threat in that these older systems do not change attitude so that subjects follow orders ""willingly."" Coercive persuasion changes both attitude and behavior, not just behavior. (38)

Coercive persuasion, or thought reform as it is also known, is best understood as a coordinated system of graduated coercive influence and behavior controls designed to deceptively and surreptitiously manipulate and influence individuals, usually in a group setting, in order for the originators of the program to profit in some way, normally financially or politically. (38)

Using rewards and punishments, efforts are made to establish considerable control over a person's social environment, time, and sources of social support. Social isolation is promoted. (38)

Non-physical punishments are used to create strong aversive emotional arousals, such as: (39) intense humiliation, loss of privilege, social isolation, social status changes, intense guilt, anxiety, manipulation.",2,1734459366.0,TargetedSolutions,2,1.0,False

I’m in the same house, it’s the same location and it’s not even a mile away from me. Cafes and restaurants in the next town over will have a lower delivery fee and I’m just not really understanding the reasoning behind the fees being so shifty in the first place/why they are so expensive now. I just don’t use it anymore because I’m not willing to spend $30 when the coffee itself is $7, there’s ~$15 in taxes and fees, and then I need to tip!
