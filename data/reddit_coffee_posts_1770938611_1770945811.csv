Sorry in advance if this becomes long but I don't know where else to ask for help or opinions. I really don't have anyone to tell. So I've been friends these girls for two years now. It's me C, S, and V. There use to be K. But k and I fell out because I didn't realize I was jealous of her. Very b**ch of me. I'm more self aware now and realize my mistakes. I know she hates me. Anf I don't blame her. I hope the best for K. Anyway. I'm having problems with V. She is friends and nice to everyone except me. She gaslights me. Is egocentric always talking about herself. Everything is a competition. Always trying to one up everything one says or does. She's always trying to humiliate me for things I do or say. I'm a pretty awkward person. And have no good social skills. So I can say weird things. Bury I can tell when theirs back handed comments or compliments. I always gave the benefit of the doubt. But if your friend does it everyday. And makes you cry. It's not funny. She's always giving me labels calling me bitter. The black nun. Annoying. Unsupportable. Imprudent among other things. I don't mess with anyone. And I don't think I'm imprudent when I keep to myself as best I can.  I once sipped her coffee. One sip. And she told me to keep it and then called me a rat all day. She's told me no one talks to me unless they need something from me. I wanted to leave and cry. My friend S said she has noticed. C. Said she didn't see or hear anything. I think it makes her an accomplice. Idk what to do. I don't think they are my friends. I always feel crazy or maybe I'm exaggerating. But I don't think friends make u question a friendship.",1,1770945543.0,venting,1,1.0,False

It’s open plan, no walls, sound travels everywhere.

Every morning, before the boss arrives, a few coworkers start chatting. Not small talk. Full volume, long non work related conversations. TV, family stuff, random gossip. It can go on for one to two hours. Non-stop.

The second the boss walks in, Everyone suddenly in work mode.

We’re not allowed to use headphones. So there’s no escape. And mornings are already low energy for me. I need quiet for 30 to 60 minutes to warm up, drink coffee, and get into focus. Instead, it feels like sitting inside a live radio show.

Because it’s countryside, the vibe is more close-knit and casual. People grew up together, same schools, same community. I get that. But from a productivity point of view, it’s draining. I reread the same document multiple times because I can’t think.

I also don’t want to be “the foreigner who complains about Japanese culture.” At the same time, this is every single day.

Anyone experienced this in smaller local offices?

1r3bk8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r3bk8u/aitah_for_getting_upset_that_my_new_bf_went_out/,AITAH for getting upset that my new bf went out of town to visit fam for Valentines Day & also went and got coffee with a woman while there?,"Hi, I’ve never posted one of these. I want to make sure I’m not overreacting, as I haven’t really truly dated for a few years now. I want to preface this by including that Valentine’s Day is the three year anniversary of me getting a sports concussion that significantly changed my life. Ever since, I have had to deal with Post Concussion Syndrome, that gave me extreme light/sound sensitivity and a more delicate & sensitive cognitive disposition. Part of the reason I haven’t dated is because of this directly, and the impact it has had on my ability to function alongside the general population. I’ve been in therapy to learn to handle my emotional reactions that have also developed since. I’ve made a lot of progress, but sometimes I still could improve my reactions. 

I (33f) have been dating someone (31m) for almost two months now. I let him know ahead of time that the anniversary can be hard for me & not to take it personally if I’m struggling. After this, a week or more ago, he told me he was going out of town to see family for VDay so they wouldn’t be lonely.  Initially, I thought it was strange because 1-2 weeks earlier, an old colleague had told him she moved to that same city, and couldnt attend his event. I didn’t say anything. However, the rest of last week he seemed distracted when we would hang out.

Fast forward to this week, I had been feeling doubtful about the longevity of the relationship. I tried to voice this and end the relationship. He responded quickly and spent the day with me sincerely trying to work on the relationship. I was so moved by him wanting to talk in depth about our attachment styles, methods for checking in, ect. We also talked about the fight he got in with his mom about going on the trip at all, needing money for it, & him dating right now. (So, he hadn’t mentioned the trip to her earlier, despite it being to go see family.)

That night after he left, I wanted to be helpful, so I spent two hours searching for job listings for him that he is qualified for & sent them to him. The next day I spent all day making him a watercolor valentines card. When I gave it to him, it seemed to make him very happy. But when I wanted to take a photo of it, he asked me not to post it on social media. This was weird to me but I didn’t really push it. I also want to mention he reiterated for the third or fourth time in a few days that he was worried I would do something Valentines related by myself, and go meet someone else. I thought this was weird and reassured him I only like him.

The next day (yesterday) he flew out to see fam. Everything was fine, I was feeling lovey dovey. He text me throughout the day. And we talked on the phone at night. I mentioned that I want to go to a Galentine‘s event, so I wouldn’t be alone, and also cause I try to be extra nice to myself this time of year (due to the anniversary). He brought up again that he was worried about me going. Then, he let me know he had plans (the next day, which is today) to have coffee with the past female colleague. I instantly was very suspicious. Why hadn’t he mentioned this earlier? Why was he only telling me now? It seemed to me that he was hiding it, and only telling me because he was worried about my plans. Maybe I’m projecting but it almost seemed like he was trying to incite jealousy from me. He said he could give me her insta handle and that ‘I could stalk her if I wanted to.’ This upset me even further, as I am not a person to do that sort of thing. He said he hadn’t seen her in a very long time and only sort of knew her and that he didn’t know how it would even go. He said it could just end up being awkward for all he knew at that moment. The whole situation read as toxic to me. I expressed my emotions. He told me he was only hanging out with her the one day cause that was the only day she was available. He then quickly retracted and said if she had wanted to hang out on Valentines Day he wouldnt have. I told him tha was all super weird and that I had to go. 

I took a shower to decompress. I did this thing I do, where in order to not react to my overwhelming emotions, I shut them down and get cold and analytical. (This is something we talked about on Monday, that I do as a protection mechanism.) I text him and laid out the facts. I told him it was sus. I told him I‘m not stupid & that deserved better than this. He responded by telling me I was spiraling and to calm down. He said he told me about it and it should be enough. He said he knows I get jealous & what I was saying was insane. 

I responded by saying im not going to argue with him. That he should do what he wants and go have fun. I said go do you, but that his actions dont match his words, & that I’d rather just protect my peace. He didn’t say anything else the rest of the night. I convinced myself it wasn’t going to work and blocked him. All day today I’ve been trying not to loop about it but I was genuinely upset. This afternoon I got on my laptop and he sent a message that came through that just said hello…. 

I decided it was immature to block him and didn’t want to just ghost him. He asked if he could call me & I said yes. He mentioned why he didn’t send me a good morning text (which I wouldn’t have gotten anyway.) He said he went to go get coffee with his past colleague. He stated immediately that she was queer and in a relationship and I had nothing to worry about. (Which he was unaware of prior.) He said I was overreacting. He was saying I was blowing it out of proportion. He said his aunt needed him and I was doubting if he really loved his family. I had said 3 times that I knew he went to see family, but he lying about it only being family. I validated him several times about seeing his family. I re-explained how this time of year is hard for me and how it made me feel that he didn’t think about me. He said I was acting like he was intentionally trying to hurt me. I corrected him by saying that I didn’t think he was as trying to hurt me, but that he wasn’t considering me. We went back and forth several times and he kept saying that Im jealous and that he keeps trying to help me every time I spiral. He criticized my ability to trust him when he’s said so many trustworthy things and tried to show his commitment. I reminded him that trust is earned through actions, and that the other times Ive “spiraled” it was because he switched up completely on me.   


He did finally admit maybe he was being selfish about the timing and wasnt considering me enough. Which I was grateful for. But theeen, he said something that bothers me almost more than this whole thing. When I talked about trying not to be sad about this time of year, and how my life has changed, he replied “Yeah but aren’t you better for it?” That really took me by surprise. I told him that a lot of growth from hardship came from it. And that it helped me grow in certain ways, but that it caused me to lose so much of my lifestyle and hobbies and even relationships with uncaring friends and family. It was a little insensitive of him to say I felt like, but I’m open to reflecting on this part more going forward.

Any way, am I the asshole for getting upset? I really have done a lot of therapy. But I don’t want to fool myself if I’m not taking enough accountabilit. Thanks so much\~!

1r3bk4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1r3bk4x/part_six_of_my_story/,part six of my story,"Just a couple of weeks after the confirmation at Walmart, I received a call from Mrs. A. She said she would be visiting in a few days and needed to speak with RPA about something important, asking me to pass along the message. By that point, I had stopped wearing my wedding ring. To me, it had become nothing more than a painful reminder that my marriage had fallen apart. The white and gold band, once beautiful with its half-carat diamond and smaller diamond chips along each side, now symbolized only sorrow.

Whenever RPA noticed my ring in its box, he would ask when I planned to put it back on. He made empty promises that he would change and keep me in his life. The day his mother was scheduled to arrive, he even begged me on his knees to wear the ring again. Reluctantly, I agreed, allowing him to slip it onto my finger once more.

When Mrs. A came to our door but did not hug RPA.  Instead, she slapped him across the face and snarled, “I raised you better than that.” RPA took the slap without protest, staring down at the floor in shame. I brought out a couple of chairs for her and D. Despite the warmth of that spring day, the atmosphere in the room turned cold as I served them some iced tea.

That was when RPA’s web of lies began to unravel, starting with Mrs. A’s confrontation. As I went to light a blue candle for RPA’s deceased son, Mrs. A stopped me, saying, “Don’t, sweetie—I have to talk to the boy.” I turned around, startled, wondering if she meant to communicate supernaturally with the child. But Mrs. A, noticing my expression, clarified, “No, he called the house via AT&T.” I stood there in shock, unable to speak, looking from RPA to his mother. I told her, “I swear to god I didn’t know.” She gave me a warm smile and replied, “I know.”

In an instant, RPA leapt to his feet, snatched his car keys, and bolted out the door. The three of us sat in tense silence as the sound of his Trans-Am tires screeching out of the parking lot echoed through the air. Mrs. A turned to me with a searching gaze and asked what RPA had told me, but I was still paralyzed by shock, unable to find the words. Instead of answering, I hurried upstairs and retrieved a copy of RPA’s résumé, handing it to Mrs. A. As she read through the details, her complexion paled, and then she silently passed the document to D, who examined it next.

It was in that moment that the reality of RPA's military service became painfully clear. Contrary to the stories she had shared, RPA had only served in the Marine Corps for approximately sixteen months, and his time ended with an other-than-honorable discharge. He had never left the United States, despite any claims to the contrary.

As the truth surfaced, memories from the past came rushing back. I recalled a particular incident when I discovered his driver’s license inside the tent, alongside his DD Form 214. On that occasion, I had glanced at the document and read a few lines, which revealed that RPA had broken a cue stick over his commanding officer’s kneecap. The altercation had occurred because the officer was speaking with RPA’s girlfriend at the time.

Until now, I had nearly forgotten about that event, but with the revelations unfolding before me, it suddenly stood out as another example of the secrets and half-truths that characterized our relationship.

The realization left me feeling as if I had wandered into a blizzard, completely lost and disoriented. I had to sit down. Looking up at Mrs. A, I saw her simply sigh, a sad acknowledgment that it was RPA’s decision whether or not to tell me the truth. I didn’t even notice when they left. Slowly, I removed my wedding ring and placed it on the coffee table, where its presence was stark against the forest green oval surface. The significance was clear: everything RPA had ever told me was a lie. Our entire life together had been built on deception. I had always been honest and open, but he had never given me the same in return, not even once.

As the weight of every lie pressed down on me, tears began to flow, each one accompanied by the painful repetition of his falsehoods in my mind. I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at the ring, until I heard the roar of the Trans-Am as it returned to the parking lot. I didn’t bother to look up when RPA came in. He paused at the base of the stairs while I sat on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Without looking at him, I asked, “Are your feelings for me real?” RPA stormed upstairs without saying a word, slamming the second bedroom door shut behind him, and then, at the top of his lungs, shouted a single word: “FUCK.”

After the confrontation with Mrs. A and the unraveling of RPA’s lies, our relationship began to deteriorate rapidly. By August of that year, things had reached a breaking point. We were facing eviction from our townhouse, unable to keep up with the bills on our combined incomes. I had returned to work at Wendy’s, despite my misgivings, because we desperately needed the money. Even with my job and RPA’s position at Walmart, our financial situation remained dire.

Working just a few blocks from the Walmart where RPA was employed, I often heard from coworkers or acquaintances if RPA was seen speaking to any other woman, Jess would tell them you know he is married. They would come by the restaurant to tell me about him. These constant reports cut deeply, and by that point, I had not only built walls around my heart but had constructed a moat around my soul—one that felt twenty feet deep and ten feet across. Sometimes, it seemed like RPA was calling out to me from the other side, but I was no longer willing or able to listen.

Eventually, we packed up all our belongings and placed them in a storage unit. We moved to a small town near the Kansas-Colorado border called Lumar, where a new Walmart was being built. RPA secured a job in loss prevention there, while I found work at Carl’s Jr. Known as Hardee’s on the East Coast. Though we tried to start over, the damage had already been done.

It wasn’t long before RPA returned to his old patterns—disappearing without explanation and leaving me alone to wonder about his whereabouts. I tried to be patient, holding out hope that things might change, but by the end of October, the inevitable happened. One evening, he walked into our room, sat heavily on the bed, and, without any preamble, declared that he no longer loved me.

I looked up from the television, stunned by his words. In that moment, something inside me snapped. Without hesitation, I pulled off my wedding ring and hurled it across the room in anger and pain. I told him plainly that if he didn’t love me, he was free to leave—and to “fuck off.”

The shock on his face was unmistakable. He scrambled to retrieve the ring from where it had landed, hidden behind the motel dresser. Returning to my side, he grabbed my hand and forced the ring back onto my finger, desperately trying to make amends. He leaned in, attempting to kiss me, and insisted, “I swear, babe, I was just joking.”

On the first day of November, a memory that remains vivid to me even after all these years, the events of that Sunday morning unfolded with a quiet intensity. I had go out to the car, hoping to find some change in order to finish our laundry. When I opened the glove box, I found, tucked among the papers, a simple engagement ring. The band was gold, with a stone larger than the one in the ring I was wearing. I returned the ring to its place and went back to our room, where RPA was sitting on the bed, absorbed in the start of the football game.

Somehow, the atmosphere in the room seemed to shift; the air felt colder. Sensing my mood, RPA turned to me and asked what was wrong. I met his gaze and responded with a single sentence, each word sharper and colder than the last: “I found it.” Instantly, RPA’s face turned pale. He tried to explain, “Honey, I wanted to get you something new—you know, new beginnings.”

I looked him in the eyes and reminded him, as I had many times before, that I hated regular gold. Without a moment’s hesitation, I threw my ring at him once again and declared, “I am done.” He immediately slid off the bed and dropped to his knees, pleading, “Please don’t leave me.” I wriggled out of his arms, determined to stand my ground and prove my point. I didn’t want to take the ring back, knowing it came from Walmart, I wanted one that was white gold. His face became even paler, and he simply stuttered, “I can’t.” I managed to free myself from his grasp, shaking my head no; I refused to let him see me cry again. I ran into the bathroom and splashed cold water on my face. As I looked into the mirror, it felt as if someone had taken a permanent marker and written “SUCKER” in big letters across the glass.

Moments later, I heard the roar of the Trans-Am coming to life outside, signaling to me that I was finally, truly done with this man. After that, I barely spoke to him at all. If I did, it was with brief, dismissive responses—“yeah, whatever,” or “sure,” or muttered under my breath, “I don’t give a shit.” Of course, the ring disappeared soon after I found it. He offered one excuse after another: “It’s safe,” or “It’s in a safety deposit box,” or even, “The dog ate it.” I just shook my head and walked away, unbothered by his fabrications. I was finishing my final plans to leave, knowing there was a Greyhound station just down the street from our hotel.

But about two days before I was set to leave, I heard his car roaring into the parking lot. His footsteps pounded up the stairs as if he were sprinting. He threw open the door with a frantic look and stared at me. “You’re leaving me,” he blurted out. I responded, “Damn it,” then looked at him and I asked, “How did you find out?” He explained that he had gone to pick me up from work, only to learn I had already quit, and my boss had called him “trash.” For the next few days, he begged me to change my mind. I told him plainly: if he wanted me to stay, he had to give me the ring. He just shook his head and said, “I can’t.” At that, I answered, “Oh well. I can’t stay.”

The day I left Colorado for the final time was marked by a sense of finality that I had never felt before. As I prepared to go, he continued to plead with me, begging me over and over to reconsider and stay. His desperation was evident, but I had already made up my mind. Then, amidst his pleas, he uttered words that solidified my resolve: “You are just like my other ex-wives.” Hearing that, I turned to face him and spoke with clarity that it was his actions, his choices, and his words—that had led us to this point. He was the one who had destroyed what we once had, the one who had dug the grave for our relationship and marriage. Without another word, I picked up my things, climbed onto that bus, and left without looking back.

In the months that followed my departure from Colorado, RPA discovered that I was staying with my mother and grandmother in North Florida. After the New Year, the only year I remember the Denver Broncos winning the Super Bowl—he drove all the way to Florida, bringing along a dog that was in heat and Missy. The visit was brief and tumultuous; it lasted less than a week before RPA was on his way back to Colorado and, inevitably, to another woman. My mother overheard him speaking with her on the phone, confirming my suspicions.

By the following Sunday, RPA had left once again. The pain of his absence lingered, and for a long time, I found myself unable to listen to Reba McEntire’s song “For My Broken Heart.” Every word of that song seemed to echo exactly how I felt during those difficult days. Then, not even a month later, RPA was calling me in a drunk state, crying about how badly he screw up our relationship. Please give him one more chance. I agree and sent him gas money for the drive. In the long run, I gave him only $ 100 because he had changed his mind, and he went and joined the Army. How I found out was that I was studying for my GED. I got a call from RPA telling me he was in basic training, looked at the receiver in my hand like it had grow other head, sure enough, he had joined the Army.

That summer, after much pleading from RPA, I agreed to attend his graduation at Fort Bragg. By then, I had dyed my hair a deep red and was embracing a new, Gothic look. I arrived in a short black dress and six-inch heels wrapped around heels, drawing the attention of everyone present. I simply smiled behind my dark lipstick, unfazed by the stares. When the ceremony ended, RPA turned to me, his face full of shock at my transformation. But at that point, I was beyond caring what any man thought I should or shouldn’t do.

After his initial surprise faded, we went to lunch with Mrs. A. During the meal, RPA excused himself to use the restroom. While he was gone, Mrs. A confided in me that RPA woman had more or less stolen the Trans-Am, leaving him penniless. She then asked me directly about my intentions towards her son. I was honest with her—I told her I was finished living in any man’s shadow and that it was time for me to forge my own path in the world. Mrs. A simply smiled and said, “Good for you.”

Later that night, I did sleep with RPA, but I made him wear a condom. Once it was over, he rolled over and went to sleep, but I lay there feeling nothing for him—no spark, not even a trace of affection for the man beside me. The next morning, while he was in the shower, I took off my ring and left it on a note on the hotel stationery. I told him to keep everything, not to look for me, and not to call my mother. I ended the note with a simple goodbye—my final farewell.

After that summer, I decided to start fresh. I got a tattoo and began to reinvent myself, becoming just another face in the local Gothic scene. My journey eventually led me to Kentucky, where I spent the next two and a half years building a new life. During this time, my family kept a close eye on RPA, especially since he had lied to the military by claiming we were not still married. That lie resulted in a financial benefit for me, as I received a substantial check, which I used to fund my move to Kentucky.

In 2002, an unexpected turn of events unfolded. I had lost my ID and needed to get a new one, so I made my way to Fort Knox. There, I received surprising news. Before the clerk could turn the computer screen away, I caught a glimpse of RPA’s records and saw that he had remarried. The date of his new marriage stood out—it was February 14 of that year. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. I realized in that moment that I was no longer bound to him; we were truly finished, and I could finally move on with my life.

In 2005, I learned through RPA’s Myspace post that he had been seriously injured while serving in Afghanistan. According to his message, he had lost his leg from the knee down, an eye, a testicle, and part of his small intestine while guarding a children’s hospital. The news was shocking, and I needed confirmation. I called his mother, who solemnly told me that it was all true. She explained that RPA had crashed twice on the operating table, fighting for his life. I could only offer to pray for him. She thanked me quietly before hanging up the phone.

A couple of weeks after the events that had finally brought me closure with RPA, I was jolted awake in the early hours of the morning by the persistent ringing of our phone. It was 3:00 a.m., and Papa Bear, clearly irritated by the interruption, mumbled that someone had better be dead to justify calling at such an ungodly hour. When he picked up the phone, she asked if she could talk to me. I was met with the sound of RPA’s fourth wife, her voice trembling and filled with anguish as she sobbed uncontrollably on the other end.

Through her tears, she accused me of being the reason RPA had ended up in the barracks, demanding to know how I could have done something like that to her. Her words were laced with desperation and confusion, but I had no patience left for the tangled web of his life or the drama that inevitably followed him. I responded flatly, telling her, “Well, you’re the dumbass who married him in the first place,” and promptly hung up.

After I returned to bed, Papa Bear pulled me close, a hint of amusement in his voice as he remarked, “That was cold.” I simply rolled over, unfazed, and went back to sleep, leaving the chaos of RPA’s world behind me once and for all.

For many years after leaving Colorado and closing that tumultuous chapter with RPA, I found a sense of peace in my life. It wasn’t until 2011 that I began attending Lander and enrolled in a speech class that old memories resurfaced. For one of my assignments, I chose to speak about the signs of emotional and physical abuse—subjects I knew intimately from my own experiences. My history included living with men who inflicted both physical and emotional pain; one had hurt me physically, while the other, RPA, was a master of emotional manipulation.

On a warm October day, as Papa Bear drove me to school, our conversation drifted to the past. He joked, wondering aloud how strange it would be if I were still connected to ‘one leg man’—our nickname for RPA at home. I quickly told Papa Bear to stop, not wanting to invite thoughts of RPA back into my world. Yet, as I prepared my PowerPoint for class, curiosity led me to contact El Paso County records office to obtain copies of relevant paperwork. To my disbelief, I discovered that RPA had knowingly committed bigamy at least once. I had married Papa Bear in 2002, believing that chapter with RPA was firmly closed. The truth was shocking, but I was grateful to have finally moved on and found happiness with a wonderful man.

In October 2012, just a year after my speech class revelation, I witnessed a moment that brought everything full circle. At the courthouse, I watched as RPA was rolled up the wheelchair ramp in a chair. He was no longer the man I once knew. Years before, he had been proud of his baldness, wearing it like a badge of honor, much like a fellow Texan in the wrestling world. Even after injuring himself playing softball, he insisted on wearing jeans during the summer months until his leg healed—a testament to the vanity he once held.

After learning about RPA’s devastating injuries, it became clear that the man I once knew was now forever changed. He was confined to a body that no longer matched the vibrant, glory-seeking spirit he had so desperately clung to in his youth. Seeing him being wheeled in by another woman, I was struck by the realization that the admiration and validation he had spent his life chasing had ultimately led to unimaginable loss. The price of that pursuit had been far greater than he ever anticipated.

With that final revelation, I felt a sense of closure. The chapter of my life that had been overshadowed by RPA’s choices and my own pain was finally ending. With a stroke of a pen, I closed that part of my story, filing it away as another footnote in the larger book of my life.

With these reflections, I close this last chapter, hoping that my story offers some comfort or understanding to those who may read it.

Good luck, I hope you find your own happy ending

How can you trust then and how come deposit amount is so huge?,"I’m staying in Korea and love this country! And to understand more I'm trying to understand Korea’s jeonse system.

Tenants give their landlord 300 to 500 million KRW upfront instead of paying monthly rent. That sounds less like rent and more like giving a massive private loan.

How do people trust an individual with that kind of money?

If the landlord goes bankrupt or property prices fall, isn’t the tenant taking huge risk?

1r3bjp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1r3bjp1/part_4/,part 4,"RPA walked over to the coffee table, picked up the pager, and studied the number displayed. He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. It closed. I looked up at the prison door, sure there were no bars, but when RPA did, I had become his prisoner, and he was the warden. I knew no one was coming to save me. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

In August, a turning point in our relationship unfolded. RPA descended the stairs, a sheet of paper from Western Airlines clutched in his hand. As I glanced at the document after it was placed on the coffee table, it became immediately apparent that it was a flight reservation to Florida. He looked at me with a determined expression and announced that we needed to spend some time apart. However, he made it clear that, during this separation, staying with my family was not an option he would allow.

The situation was further complicated by the involvement of a couple we both knew. March or April  before the sh!t really  hit the fan hard; they approached RPA with a request: they wanted to borrow money to finance their own move to Florida. Without hesitation, RPA agreed and handed them approximately $2,000 to assist with their relocation. On the night the couple arrived to collect the money, all three turned to me as if seeking my approval. I raised my hands, distancing myself from the decision, and stated firmly, “Nope, not getting involved in this.” Despite my reluctance and clear stance against loaning money to friends, RPA proceeded with the transaction.

By the fifteenth of  August, I found myself boarding a plane to Florida. RPA sent me off with a cashier’s check for $1,500. Once the check cleared at the bank, I began using those funds to pay their bills and manage household expenses for the people I was staying with. Additionally, nearly $500 was spent on craft supplies, which, in the end, were left unused and simply accumulated dust on the screened-in patio of their rental home.

While I was away in Florida, my neighbor  aka Jess and her roommate kept me informed about everything occurring back home. It quickly became evident that RPA had turned our house into a revolving door for women. Multiple times, different women were seen leaving my home, making it clear that his behavior was blatant and recurring.

One Sunday afternoon, Jess decided to stop by the house. She later called to recount what she had witnessed: RPA answered the door in nothing but his boxer briefs, and inside was another woman, dressed in only one of his shirts. Jess confronted the situation head-on, making a pointed remark: “Wow, does your wife Jean know about this? With one phone call, she would be back here and this time she would not miss with her bat.” According to Jess, both RPA and the woman turned pale at her words. The tension escalated when, moments later, Jess heard a screaming from our home then women making the statement she had just realized, “You are married!

As the woman hurried out the front door, only partially dressed, RPA had managed to put on a pair of shorts. Jess, unfazed by the chaos, was casually seated on the down of her truck, eating popcorn and watching the dramatic scene unfold. According to Jess, after the woman sped away, her car tires screeching as she left the parking lot, RPA approached Jess with a glare and warned, “You will not tell Jean anything.” Jess, however, simply smiled back at him and replied, “Oh, she knows—and a lot more than you think.”

What RPA failed to realize before sending me to Florida was that he had neglected to take my bank card for our joint account. This single oversight became my means of staying connected to our financial situation, even while separated by distance. From afar, I regularly logged in and examined each transaction, watching as large sums—sometimes thousands of dollars at a time—were withdrawn week after week. The money that disappeared had originated from his father's inheritance, and seeing it dwindle so rapidly left me increasingly anxious. I paid close attention to when our rent and bills were due, double-checking the remaining balance and recalculating our finances with each update. As I tracked the mounting withdrawals, it became painfully clear that the financial security we once relied on was eroding, and my position left me powerless to intervene.

After Jess and her roommate made their presence known, RPA ceased bringing women back to the townhouse, fully aware that they were keeping a close eye on his activities. However, this did not signify a genuine change in his behavior. Instead, I soon observed a clear shift in our financial transactions. Charges from upscale hotels began to surface, with names that were all too familiar to me due to my past work experiences in housekeeping and at the front desk of these establishments.

One such hotel was the DoubleTree, a landmark known for being one of the tallest buildings downtown during the late '80s and early '90s. Its reputation for spacious and expensive suites on the upper floors made the substantial charges on our accounts stand out even more. The transactions from the DoubleTree and other similar hotels made it evident that, although RPA had changed his approach, his actions remained essentially unchanged—he simply shifted the locations of his behavior from our home to high-end hotels.

Separated by more than 1,500 miles, I could do nothing but watch from afar as our bank account dwindled, the balance eventually falling to less than $2,500. In less than a year, nearly all of the money was gone. The days after my birthday in October brought a turning point. RPA called to say he needed to visit a sick female family member in Lubbock, Texas, and would be gone for the weekend of Halloween. When I asked who would look after Missy in his absence, he assured me she would be fine for a couple of days.

 After that phone call, my decision was clear: my sweet Missy needed her mama. Despite the objections and protests from the couple I was staying with, I boarded a Greyhound bus in Florida, determined to return home to Colorado. The journey was long and marked by changing weather. As the bus crossed the Mississippi River, heavy rain gave way to sleet, and by the time we entered Texas, snow had begun to fall. A couple of hours’ delay in New Mexico slowed our progress, but as we finally crossed into Colorado, I gazed out the window, recognizing places from my childhood. We stopped briefly in Pueblo, Colorado—a fifteen-minute drop-off that signaled I was almost home.

As my journey home neared its end, I decided to act and confirm my suspicions. First, I called Jess to ask if she had seen any activity at the townhouse and whether RPA was there. Jess assured me that he was indeed at home and mentioned that a strange car had been parked in the visitor spot for several days, only adding to my growing unease. I thanked her for keeping an eye on things, then, doing my best to remain composed, I dialed the house number from a pay phone.

RPA answered on the second ring with a casual ""hello."" In the background, I heard a woman's voice say, ""Babe, who is that?"" My heart pounded as I hesitated before finally speaking. With as much calm as I could muster, I told him, ""That woman needs to be gone because I am only an hour away, and you'd better pick me up at the bus station.""

RPA sounded stunned, replying, ""You’re joking."" Instead of answering, I pulled the phone away from my ear, letting the sounds of idling Greyhound buses roar through the receiver so he would realize where I was. Suddenly, I heard him yell, ""Shit!"" and the line filled with frantic he forgot to hang up the phone commotion  on the other end as he warned the woman in the house, ""You need to leave now because my wife has a bad temper."" The un-know women screaming “ you are married,” then the line went dead, I smiled other small victory for me. An hour later, the bus pulled into the downtown terminal. There was RPA leading the Trans-Am as I climbed down; he looked like a child who had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. I am haunted by that memory and doubts. He had insisted that it was a movie in the background, but I knew better—I could see through the lie. All I wanted was to avoid sleeping on those sheets, knowing they had been used by others with questionable intentions and filthy habits. I looked up at RPA and twisted, smiled, and called all of them “nasty, rotten crotches,"" having been there filled me with disgust and dread. RPA turned paler. I just smiled and told myself, “Got you, sick fucker.”

Later that night, we drove together to the Walmart near our house. The car ride was heavy with silence—I couldn’t bring myself to speak to him, my thoughts swirling with anger and suspicion. I kept my face pressed against the window, watching the glow of the streetlights stretch and blur past as we made our way down the main drag.

At the store, I picked out new sheets, pillows, a mattress pad, and a can of Lysol. The idea of sleeping on anything that those women had used made my skin crawl. I couldn’t stop thinking about head lice, bed bugs, or whatever else an unwashed body might have left behind. I wanted to reclaim at least a sense of cleanliness and control, so I made sure to get everything I needed to make the bed entirely new.

Once we got home, the unmistakable scent of strong, cheap perfume hit me as soon as I walked in the door. The smell clung to everything, a stark reminder of what had happened. Clutching Missy in one of my arms, I grabbed my trusty bat from the closet and began to check the house, starting downstairs. After making sure everything was clear, I headed upstairs, first stopping to look in the room with the computer and all his models, then into the bathroom.

Finally, I entered the bedroom. As expected, the waterbed had been stripped, and in the corner was a pile of sheets, pillows, and the mattress pad—ripped, as if it had been torn off in a hurry. The scent of cheap perfume was overpowering, saturating the discarded bedding. I glanced at RPA with a dark, pointed smile and remarked, “That must have been a bitch, because you ripped the mattress pad.”

After wiping down the waterbed mattress, I finished making the bed with my new mattress pad, sheets, and pillows. I took a long shower, hoping to wash away the lingering sense of contamination and unease. Settling in with a book, I tried to find comfort and reclaim the bedroom as my own space, free from the memories and suspicions that haunted me.

Later that evening, RPA came upstairs. He lay his head on my lap and tried to snuggle close, his tone soft and reassuring. “Honey, nothing happened, I swear,” he insisted. But I could see through the act. I was too exhausted to argue, so I told him I was tired and turned away, focusing on getting some rest and distancing myself emotionally.

From that moment forward, everything changed inside me. I no longer felt like the same person who had endured doubt and uncertainty—I began to transform into someone stronger, more resolute, and unwilling to be ignored or deceived any longer. My resolve hardened, and I felt a force within me determined to confront the truth, no matter how painful.

About a week later, RPA left for his trip back to Texas. During his time away, the truth behind his web of deception finally began to come undone. As soon as I watched him drive out of the parking lot, the house phone rang—his mother was calling. Sensing an opportunity, I asked her directly about the relative in Lubbock that RPA claimed was gravely ill. Her response was weary and honest: “Sweetheart, we don’t have any family in Lubbock.” In that moment, every last shred of RPA’s story collapsed, revealing just how far his dishonesty had gone.

After I hung up with Mrs. A, I hurried upstairs. RPA had carelessly left behind a stack of printed emails—correspondence between himself and a woman from Missouri, as well as someone in Lubbock. As I read through the messages, I learned they had been making plans to spend a romantic Halloween weekend together. Each new discovery fueled my anger and heartbreak, and the storm within me grew stronger. I also noticed two separate phone numbers from two different states attached to those emails, which only confirmed the complexity of RPA’s lies.

Determined to uncover the whole truth, I went to the computer and looked up the area codes for the phone numbers. Then, I walked to Walgreens, where I knew there was a pay phone. By the time I arrived, dusk was settling in, and the air had grown cold, but the fire inside me kept me moving. I dialed the first number, which was in Missouri, since he was in Texas. A man answered, and I introduced myself, explaining that our spouses were cheating on us with each other. He responded with a heartbreaking sigh, then asked if I was certain. I described what I had found in the emails about their plans to meet in Texas, and I told him that the messages were intimate in nature.

When he asked if I could read some of the emails to him, I refused, explaining that I was in a public place and didn’t want anyone to overhear our conversation. He let out another sigh and then requested that I send him copies of the emails instead. Agreeing to his request, I wrote down his address and prepared a thick tan envelope containing the correspondence. The next day, I went to the post office, handed the package to the clerk, and paid nearly two dollars in stamps to send it off to Missouri. As I let the envelope go, a grim sense of satisfaction washed over me—I thought to myself, “mess with a bull, you get the horns.”

Before I made it home, my pager started vibrating insistently in the front pocket of my jeans. The display showed “RPA 911” followed by his number. I glanced at the small, blue-green, clear device in my hand, smirked, and spoke softly into the air, “Let RPA know how dead air feels.”

As I stepped into our townhouse, the house phone was ringing nonstop. Checking the Caller ID, I saw it was the number of the other woman in Texas. Without hesitation, I unplugged the phone from the wall, then went upstairs and did the same with the phone there. Finally, I sank down onto the couch and took a long, deep breath—it felt like I could breathe again.

I turned on the TV for background noise, and soon after, Jess knocked on the glass screen door. I told her to come in, and she sat down beside me on the couch. She shook her head in disbelief and finally asked, “What did you do?” I explained everything to her. She shook her head again and said, “Man, you are cold.” I just gave her a warm smile and thanked her, especially for all her help. Later, Jess, her roommates, and I decided to unwind with some drinks at the Cowboys’ Halloween party in a couple of days. But the next day Jess came over and told me RPA was blowing their house phone because ours would just ring also. By this point, I placed my pager tin he towel closet upstairs so I could not hear it.

After some time, I decided to plug the house phone back in. As soon as the front door closed, Jess was headed back to her place, and the phone rang almost immediately. Glancing at the Caller ID, I saw it was the same number from before. I let it ring twice before answering, and it was RPA on the line. In the background, I could hear a woman sobbing uncontrollably. It seemed her husband had called her to confront her about the affair, and she was pleading with me not to send the emails, explaining that she and her husband had a prenuptial agreement. RPA was also begging me not to send them. I assured them I hadn’t sent anything, though in truth, that was a lie.

Before ending the call, I disconnected the phone from the wall again and told RPA to enjoy his weekend, because I intended to enjoy mine. That Halloween night would become the best I’d had since turning twenty-one. Before heading to the club, I stopped at the liquor store and picked up a couple of packs of Zima. During my period of exile, thanks to my own husband, I’d learned that I could drink Zima with minimal side effects, so I enjoyed a few drinks and danced in the clothes I chose for myself—not those RPA wanted me to wear.

Everyone at the party ended up pretty everyone was trashed, except for me. I was sober enough to drive us all back in the car that RPA’s dad had left him, even though I probably shouldn’t have been behind the wheel. That night, I discovered that I actually drove better with a standard transmission after a few drinks in me, and since I knew every back road, I got everyone home safely. The only trouble was parking—I couldn’t find a spot in the lot, so I left the car in a space on Yuma. I got plenty of grief for my parking job, and as I reached my door, I could hear my friends singing off-key about my parking skills, making fun of me as I laughed along.

After closing the front door behind me, I grabbed another bottle of clear liquor, letting the alcohol help wash away the tension that still lingered from the evening’s events. The more I drank, the less the stress weighed on me—it was the best release I’d felt in a long time. Time slipped away unnoticed, and before I realized it, the first hints of dawn were creeping in. I glanced over at the coffee table, now crowded with empty bottles, evidence of my desperate attempt to quiet my mind. When I tried to shake my head, I could still feel the buzz humming through my body. Somehow, I managed to get myself ready for bed and climbed beneath the covers, Missy curling up peacefully in my arms. I drifted into a deep, heavy sleep.

I have no idea how long I slept before I was startled awake by the unmistakable roar of the Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. Sitting up, I stared at the closet doors, a chill settling over me as I realized my feelings had turned cold toward the man driving that car. I laid back down, listening intently as RPA opened the front door, he must have noticed all the empty bottles scattered across the coffee table. I heard him climbing the stairs, two steps at a time. As he approached, I reached up and switched on the light above my head, mounted on the waterbed  headboard. From the doorway, RPA’s voice cut through the silence, “You’ve changed.” I looked over at him and, with a wicked smile, replied, “Whose fault would that be, hmm? Go look in the damn mirror. To see who cause this change.

That afternoon, after I drifted back to sleep, I woke to the sound of him cleaning out the room. He gathered bags of papers threw way in dumpster outside, seemingly unaware that they were destined for a broken man. When can back in the bedroom then he just glanced at me like ha-ha you not have the evidence anymore, I met his gaze with a calm smile. My composure must have unnerved him, but I felt nothing but a cold acceptance about everything that had transpired.

By November 4^(th), things took a deadly turn. He was upstairs in that room when I heard his pager buzzing again. Suddenly, he rushed downstairs and looked at me where I sat quietly on the couch watching TV. ""I have to take this,"" he said. RPA approached and tried to kiss my cheek, but I placed my hand over his mouth, refusing the gesture. He left.

Within five minutes of leaving, he returned—the roar of the car tires screeching into the parking lot still echoing in the air. My instincts told me to hide, but I was finished playing nice. Bursting through the front door, RPA was so furious that he nearly broke it. His entire body trembled with pure, unfiltered rage as he glared at me. ""You lied,"" he snarled. I looked him in the eyes and simply asked, ""About what? “You mail those emails,"" he spat out.

I didn’t deny it. I smiled and replied, ""Yes, I did. Not to her, but to her husband—because his wife couldn’t keep her legs closed and chose to cheat with another man. Actions have consequences.""

With that, RPA roughly shoved the coffee table aside and yanked me up to my feet. He snarled again, his words laced with accusation: ""He hit her and is filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery.""

I looked up at RPA and, unable to hold back my contempt, started laughing at him. I said, “Good,” letting my anger show. In response, he threw me to the floor, calling me a cruel, heartless bitch. Looking up at him, I told him plainly, “You made me this way.” I managed to stand and tried to escape, heading upstairs to put some distance between us.

Suddenly, I heard Jean—he was sitting on the couch, holding the Glock. The gun was pointed at me once again. Reacting instinctively, I dropped to the floor behind the stairs, making sure there was something to shield me from the weapon. Everything felt like it was happening in slow motion as RPA fired a hollow-point round in my direction. For years after, I could still recall the smell of cordite, the sound of ringing in my ear, and the heat of the bullet as it embedded itself in the wall. If it had traveled just a few more inches, it would have lodged in my left shoulder.

The shock from RPA’s actions was written plainly across his face, his complexion drained to white as he stared at both the gun and me. Seizing the opportunity, I scrambled upstairs, locking myself in the bathroom and climbing into the tub, desperate for any sense of safety and a moment to gather my thoughts.

**By: Madam Lace**



**Dedication**



**To Chet Holmgren, for being the ultimate inspiration behind Rowan Vex — tall, talented, and undeniably magnetic.**



**And to my dear friend, whose daydreams and fantasies about her favorite player sparked every swoon, blush, and heartbeat in these pages. Without your imagination, this story would’ve stayed on the bench.**



**Thank you for being my muse, my co-conspirator in mischief, and the reason Rowan exists.**



**Prologue**



**He’s the league’s most arrogant star — flashy, confident, always smirking at the cameras. The kind of player who knows he’s the best and isn’t shy about it.**



**She’s the quiet new intern in the team’s media department. Smart. Observant. A little shy. Definitely not prepared for the way he keeps looking at her like she’s the only person in the room.**



**At first, it’s harmless teasing.**



**He calls her “Intern.”**

**She refuses to laugh at his jokes.**

**He decides he likes that.**



**But what starts as playful banter turns into lingering touches in empty hallways… stolen glances during press conferences… late-night texts that definitely aren’t about work.**



**The problem?**



**Team policy strictly forbids relationships between players and staff.**



**If anyone finds out, she loses her career before it even starts.**

**If anyone finds out, his image takes a hit.**



**So they keep it secret.**



**Which only makes it hotter.**



**Because he’s cocky with everyone else** 

**but with her?**

**He softens.**

**Protective.**

**Gentle.**

**Whispers against her ear in the shadows of the arena.**

**And she?**

**The shy intern starts leaning into him.**

**Teasing him back.**

**Whispering things that make the “untouchable” superstar lose his composure.**



**They both know they’re crossing a line.**



**But neither of them wants to step back.**





**The first time Rowan Vex walks into the arena, the air shifts.**



**It isn’t loud. He doesn’t announce himself.**



**He just steps onto the court like he owns the hardwood beneath it.**



**Tall — unfairly tall — all long limbs and loose confidence. His warm-ups hang off his lean frame, but there’s nothing fragile about the way he moves. Every stride is smooth. Measured. Like he already knows how this ends.**



**He dribbles once.**



**The sound echoes.**



**Players glance over. A few whisper. Someone laughs — nervous.**



**Rowan doesn’t look at them.**



**He rolls the ball up his arm, catches it behind his back without breaking stride, then finally lifts his gaze to the stands. Slow. Deliberate. Like he’s selecting something.**



**Someone.**



**His mouth tilts — not quite a smile. Worse. A promise.**



**He takes the first shot from well beyond the line. No hesitation. No adjustment.**



**Swish.**



**The net snaps like it’s applauding him.**



**Rowan exhales softly, glances toward the sideline, and this time his eyes lock with yours. They linger — cool, assessing — then flick down and back up again in a way that feels intentional.**



**He jogs backward down the court, not breaking eye contact.**



**“Hope you’re paying attention,” he calls casually, voice low but carrying. “I don’t repeat performances.”**



**And then he winks.**











**Chapter One — Collision Course**



**Serena Vale was late.**



**Not fashionably late. Not “cute intern scrambling with coffee” late.**



**Disastrously late.**



**Serena is a beautiful average-height woman with a naturally tan complexion that gives her a warm, sun-kissed glow. Her hair is curly, framing her face softly. Her eyes are light brown, gentle and expressive, that usually reflecting a calm and approachable demeanor but not today. Today she anxious.**



**Her badge was twisted, one heel half-buckled, her tote bag slipping off her shoulder as she rushed down the polished hallway of the arena. The building hummed with early practice energy — distant sneakers squeaking, bass from warm-up music vibrating faintly through the walls.**



**“First day,” she muttered under her breath. “Don’t trip. Don’t talk too fast. Don’t embarrass—”**



**She turned the corner.**



**And ran directly into a wall.**



**No — not a wall.**



**A chest.**



**Solid. Warm. Unmoving.**



**Her bag slid off her shoulder. Papers fanned across the floor like surrender flags.**



**“Oh my God, I am so—” She dropped to her knees, mortified, gathering papers blindly. “I’m so sorry. I wasn’t looking, I—”**



**A shadow fell over her.**



**Then a slow exhale.**



**“Clearly.”**



**The voice was low. Amused. Smooth in a way that felt intentional.**



**Serena froze.**



**She looked up.**



**And immediately wished she hadn’t.**



**Rowan Vex stood over her, tall enough that the overhead lights framed him like something sculpted rather than born. Long limbs. Lean build. Practice jersey hanging loose over sharp lines of muscle. His dark hair slightly damp like he’d just finished drills.**



**And his eyes.**



**Cool. Assessing.**



**Dragging slowly over her face as if she were something he’d found interesting.**



**Her breath caught.**



**He crouched — unhurried — and picked up one of her fallen pages. His fingers were long. Controlled. He didn’t hand it to her right away.**



**“Intern?” he asked, glancing at the logo on her badge.**



**“Yes,” she squeaked. Then cleared her throat. “Yes. First day.”**



**He hummed like that explained everything.**



**“Rough start.”**



**Her cheeks burned. “I said I was sorry.”**



**A corner of his mouth lifted.**



**Not a smile.**



**A challenge.**





**Her heart did something deeply unprofessional.**



**He finally handed her the paper — but instead of releasing it immediately, his fingers held the edge just a second longer than necessary.**



**Electric.**



**He leaned in slightly. Not enough to be obvious. Just enough that she caught the clean scent of soap and something darker beneath it.**



**“You always run into strangers like that,” he murmured, “or am I special?”**



**Serena’s shyness flared — the instinct to retreat, to apologize again.**



**But something else sparked too.**



**Something newer. Sharper.**



**She stood, smoothing her skirt, meeting his eyes for one brave second.**



**“I usually look where I’m going,” she said softly. “You just happened to be in the way.”**



**There it was.**



**A flicker.**



**His expression changed — subtle, but real.**



**Interest.**



**He straightened slowly, towering over her again.**



**“In the way?” he repeated, amused.**



**She swallowed. “Excuse me, Mr. Vex.”**



**She stepped around him.**



**Didn’t run.**



**Walked.**



**She could feel his gaze on her back the entire time.**



**After a beat, his voice followed her down the hall.**



**“Careful, Serena.”**



**She stopped.**



**How did he—?**

1r3bhvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r3bhvo/im_i_sabotaging_something_good_or_is_it_my/,I'm I sabotaging something good or is it my intuition,"So I've been a bit of a dilemma and I'm going to try to be as anonymous as I can about this whole situation, and to make a long and very detailed story short.

I met this man last semester, we are studying the same thing and have a lot of the same intellectual interests. Not to toot my own horn, and only because it's relevant to his attraction to me, but I'm a very pretty girl and have very niche academic interests, and a lot of soul and depth to me that I don't reveal too much of. I just carry a unique vibe, and it always makes me fearful of predatory men. So I was very much a loner last semester, and when I met him, I could tell he really was blown away by me, but I was not interested with him. Turns out we had a class together, so we interacted relatively often, but it was very brief and surface level since I wasn't interested in getting to know anyone and was very reserved.

When I first met him, I was very taken back by his intensity and admiration for me, and I wasn't sure if my intuition was telling me that he's dangerous and I should run, or if he was a mirror for the emotional and existential depth inside me as well. Either way I wasn't ready to confront him, and so the semester went on. I guess I felt guilty for rejecting him so harshly, and I wanted to be open to the professional and academic relationship we could have since we both are interested in the same field. I reached out to him over break, and we agreed to meet.

Weeks went by, and we met at the same academic club, and I was surprisingly excited to see him, so we talked and got coffee. We actually weren't alone the first time we hung out, we became acquainted with someone else at the club. We had amazing open ended discussions about all our interests and it was really nice. We've hung out 1-on-1 four times since then, and we got progressively closer. He's incredibly respectful towards me, very chivalrous and I've pointed that out. He comes from a very religious country and influential/wealthy family, but is very open about his agnostic beliefs. We have that in common, coming from a religious family but being very open minded. He's very intelligent, poetic and well-read. He's also incredibly romantic and purposeful in everything he does with me, like its out of a movie, it's like art. That really just scratches the surface, he's very social and well-liked by people, kind and admitting to his faults, etc.

The only things that scare me away, is on the third day of hanging out we became quite physical, nothing beyond hugging and holding hands, and like being close to each other. I'm not sure if its my prior experience that make me scared of that, because I have been physically vulnerable with someone in the past and it was a really big mistake, or that my strict and hyper-religious background makes it feel wrong when it isn't. I just find myself overthinking a lot around him, as its gone on its gotten better, but I just don't want to be blindsided because i've seen a lot of women in my life suffer from men and love. I also don't know if it's too good to be true, if he's telling me that he knows me and sees me and understands me just from having observed me these past few months, but he doesn't. He's very intense and romantic and intelligent, which are all the things that I am but for some reason it feels like it's too much, i'm used to swimming up from my depth and meeting others in their shallowness.

I also grew up in a really dysfunctional and tumultuous household, fighting and responsibility from a very young age. I'm aware it's made me fearfully avoidant, so something like this, someone so free and similar and healed is almost a threat to my nervous system. I mean I have worked a lot of myself, but I'm still young and have a lot to learn when it comes to interacting with others. I even feel guilty, because he's a few years older than me, if all these qualities are genuine (i have intrusive thoughts that hes an intense narcissist sociopath that is manipulating tf out of me) he deserves someone just as healed.

I don't know, there aren't really red flags. He speaks very highly of himself, which reminds me of my narcissistic father. He has admitted to being physically violent when he was younger in his home country because of the way people imposed their ideas on him. And being so obsessed and in love with me is something that could be dangerous. I also wasn't physically attracted to him but that's something i don't care about, I'm pretty sapiosexually inclined. Anyways yeah, this guy is great lol, I guess it just came out of nowhere and he represents a lot of things I want to develop towards, being ambitious and creative and successful, and honest and transparent about my believes and spontaneous and adventurous. I am willing to do the growth, I'm trying to be accountable about my faults and hyper critical inclination to nit pick and judge. But I also don't know if my intuition can tell somethings wrong, because isn't love supposed to come naturally and easy, aren't I supposed to be immediately attracted and at ease in my mind. I think I know the answer, you guys tell me though. Also its been a week since all this started lol",1,1770945224.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1r3bhqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1r3bhqk/part_three_of_my_story/,part three of my story,"Word about RPA being married to me spread quickly, and it wasn’t long before my reputation preceded me. Apparently, the story of how I handled things with the bat traveled fast—so much so that, according to what I heard, the doorman at that particular strip club actually kept a picture of me by the entrance. It was as if they thought I might storm in at any moment, though, truthfully, I had no intention of ever setting foot in a place like that.

The confrontation with RPA and his companion at our home did not remain a private incident—it quickly sent shockwaves through RPA's social circle, especially among his friends and the staff at the local strip clubs. News of my actions spread rapidly, and soon, my name became synonymous with the story of how I stood my ground that night. Even the employees at the club seemed to be on alert, behaving as if they expected me to storm in at any moment. Despite the rumors and the newly acquired reputation, I was resolute in my decision to avoid any place tied to RPA’s betrayals.

The notoriety that followed was never something I sought out. Instead, it became an unintentional but powerful reminder—to myself and to others—of just how far I was willing to go to protect my dignity and assert my personal boundaries. The story, now a part of local lore, underscored the seriousness of my resolve and the lengths I would take to defend what mine was.

Only a few days had passed since the explosive events at our home when RPA made the choice to return to the same strip club. He seemed determined to act as though nothing had changed, clinging to a sense of normalcy despite everything that had happened. Yet his efforts were quickly thwarted. Less than an hour after leaving, he stormed back into our house, his anger palpable and his voice echoing through the rooms as he hurled accusations at me. He shouted that I had ruined his night, making it clear that he held me responsible for his misfortune. The reason for his fury became apparent: he had been banned from the club, a direct consequence of the reputation I had earned after the confrontation. As he ranted and blamed me for the situation, I met his glare with a calm, knowing smile and simply held his gaze. Inwardly, I recognized that sometimes, life has a way of balancing the scales, delivering its own form of justice whether or not we seek it.

 After RPA began sleeping on the floor in that room, a new and unsettling routine emerged: the phone calls. Jess, ever resourceful and supportive, showed me how to listen in on these conversations. It didn’t take long before we found ourselves staring down a staggering $500 a month phone bills, the result of RPA’s endless hours spent calling women across the country.

These weren’t just casual conversations. Time and again, I overheard him engaging in explicit phone sex—sometimes with the speakerphone on, forcing me to hear every word against my will. The experience was so disturbing that I found myself wishing I could wash my ears out with bleach, desperate to erase what I’d just heard.

One night, Jess and I sat together, listening to yet another call. To my shock and horror, I realized that RPA was speaking with girls who were clearly underage—one admitted to being sixteen, the other just fifteen. Their conversation quickly turned to plans for the girls to come to our home and meet RPA in person. Unable to remain silent, I snatched the phone and put an immediate stop to the situation. I made my position clear: “Oh hell, no. I will not have jailbait in my house. The minute you set foot on my doorstep, the cops will be called, and you’ll be sent back to your parents.”

The fallout from intercepting that troubling phone call was immediate. RPA charged down the stairs, his face contorted with fury, hurling insults and calling me a crazy bitch. Rather than backing down, I met his anger with a calm, defiant smile. “Oops, did I mess that up for you? My bad,” I quipped, refusing to let his rage intimidate me. The tension in the air was punctuated by Jess, who couldn’t help but burst into laughter—so much that she nearly fell out of her chair. RPA, caught off guard and realizing that Jess had witnessed everything, was left speechless. I seized the small victory, bowing dramatically to Jess and blowing a kiss in RPA’s direction—a symbolic gesture of triumph amid the chaos that had unfolded.

A few days later, Jess and I sat together at the dining room table, the silence between us heavy with the aftermath of everything that had recently transpired. She quietly observed me, noticing the tension in my posture as I gripped my glass of soda with both hands. I felt the urge to reach for something stronger to numb the relentless stress, but my medical condition made that impossible now. The risks of alcohol mixing with my medication were too great, so I held on to my resolve, choosing my health over momentary relief.

My mind drifted to the earlier chapters of my life, when coping with hardship often meant seeking refuge in self-destructive habits. In those days, I turned to underage drinking, hoping the numbness would dull the pain that weighed on me. With a large glass of Jack Daniels became my escape whenever I could afford it, while Jim Beam served as a cheaper substitute when money was tight. On the most difficult nights, when there seemed to be no other options, even Mad Dog 20/20 was enough to quiet the turmoil inside.

Yet, as time passed, I came to understand the consequences of those choices. The relief was temporary, and the spiral of self-medicating only compounded the struggle, especially as new health challenges emerged. It was a lesson learned the hard way—that turning to alcohol provided no real solution and inevitably made things worse. Now, faced with the pressures and stress that still arise, I am determined to prioritize my well-being above all else. No matter how strong the urge to escape may be, I choose to protect my health and resist the temptation to fall back into old patterns.

Sensing my unease, Jess leaned in with a look of concern and quietly asked what was troubling me. I exhaled slowly, the weight of exhaustion heavy in my chest, and finally found the words to express what I had been holding inside. “I’m just tired,” I confessed, my voice barely rising above a whisper. I tried to explain the strange comfort that used to come with certainty, no matter how painful the reality. “At least with a beating, I knew when the hit was coming.” My gaze drifted around the room as I gestured helplessly, attempting to capture the overwhelming sense of dread that now permeated my days. “But this—” I said, letting my hand fall to my lap. “This is so much worse.” The unpredictability, the constant anxiety, and the fear of what might happen next felt far more unbearable than any physical pain I had endured before. The uncertainty gnawed at me, leaving me feeling more vulnerable and exposed than ever.

 As Jess and I sat together at the table, I finally found the courage to voice the fear that had been consuming me for days. My hands trembled as I wrapped them around my glass, searching for words that felt nearly impossible to say aloud. With my voice barely above a whisper, I confessed, “I’m terrified to get close to my husband.” The admission made my vulnerability feel raw and exposed, the weight of recent events pressing heavily on my shoulders.

The anxiety gnawing at me was relentless. After everything RPA had done, the betrayals, the secrecy, and the countless nights spent wondering where he truly was, I found myself plagued by an overwhelming sense of dread. The fear that he might have brought home an STD haunted me constantly. It was a possibility I had never anticipated, a consequence I neither asked for nor deserved. The idea of facing such a risk, not because of anything I had done, but solely because of his choices, filled me with a profound sense of injustice and fear. Because of this, I refused to let him touch me at all, determined to protect myself in whatever way I could.

Unable to meet Jess’s eyes, I lowered my gaze, my words faltering. “I know he’s been sleeping with those strippers,” I admitted, each syllable heavy with resignation. Saying it aloud made the reality all the more undeniable. The trust I once had in my marriage had been shattered, replaced by uncertainty and the constant worry of what else might be waiting for me as a result of his actions.

Jess reached across the table and squeezed my hand, offering a small measure of comfort during a moment of vulnerability. Sensing my distress, she attempted to reassure me, her tone gentle as she asked if I was truly certain about what RPA had done. Unable to find the words, I simply raised an eyebrow in response—my silence speaking volumes about what I already knew.

“A man who comes home with his clothes, his skin, everything covered in body glitter and reeking of cheap body spray—there’s only one explanation, Jess. Only one,” I told her, my voice steady despite everything. Jess didn’t argue with me; the understanding in her eyes was clear. She nodded softly and replied with a quiet, “Oh,” acknowledging the painful truth without judgment.

I let out a long sigh, exhaustion washing over me. The truth could no longer be denied. “It all makes sense,” I confessed, the realization settling heavily in my chest. “He leaves the house with at least seven hundred dollars in his wallet and comes home with a hundred and fifty—or less. I know exactly where all that money is going—straight to some woman in stripper heels and a thong.” As the words left my mouth, they seemed to linger in the stillness, the painful reality impossible to ignore. The gap between what I wanted to believe and what I knew had grown too wide to bridge.

That afternoon, a heavy tension settled over the house, almost as if it had taken on a physical form. Suddenly, the sharp bang of the bedroom door slamming shut upstairs echoed through the rooms, a clear signal that trouble was brewing. Not long after, RPA appeared at the bottom of the stairs, his movements sluggish and his look disheveled. He was still wearing his red sweatpants, the ones with ""USMC"" spray-painted in bold, longhand letters down one leg. The fact that he looked as though he had just rolled out of bed—even though it was well past one in the afternoon—made the atmosphere feel even heavier, his disheveled presence adding to the unease that already gripped the house.

RPA’s eyes darted to Jess before settling back on me, signaling that he wanted to speak with me in private. Sensing the tension in the room, Jess responded with quiet understanding. She stood up gently, her movements soft and deliberate, and as she passed, she laid a comforting hand on my shoulder. Leaning in, she whispered for me to call her later—a subtle but meaningful gesture of support. I managed only a nod; my attention locked on the sky-blue placemats spread across the dining room table. My heart raced as I braced myself for whatever was about to come.

Anxiety rose up inside me, tightening my chest with familiar dread as I silently hoped RPA wouldn’t lash out at my face or head. Even as I kept my gaze lowered, I was intensely aware of how close he stood. From the corner of my eye, I tracked his hand as it paused near my head. Slowly, he reached out—not with aggression, but with an unexpected gentleness—and turned my face toward him. Despite his touch, my wary eyes stayed fixed on the off-white carpet beneath the dining room table, conditioned by past experience to avoid making eye contact.

RPA spoke in a soft tone that was unusual for him: “Jean, look at me.” For a brief moment, I glanced up and met his hazel eyes. In that instant, I thought I saw remorse flicker across his face—a rare and fleeting vulnerability. But just as quickly as it appeared, the remorse vanished, replaced by the familiar flash of anger that immediately put me back on edge.

In an instant, RPA's demeanor shifted from defensive to hostile. He snarled at me, making it clear that how he spent his money was none of my concern. He asserted his authority by reminding me that I was his possession, reducing our relationship to the symbolism of the ring on my finger. The message was unmistakable: I had no say in the matter. Then, as if to drive the point home, he forcefully pushed me out of my chair and walked away, leaving me shaken and vulnerable on the floor.

That night marked a turning point. Fearful of what might happen next, I stopped sleeping in our bedroom. Instead, I moved downstairs to the couch, always keeping a bat within arm’s reach—either tucked under the couch or resting on our green coffee table. Sleep became elusive; I remained vigilant, never fully letting my guard down. If I heard RPA coming downstairs, I would quickly escape to the bathroom and lock the door, waiting until he returned upstairs before emerging.

By the fourth day, the relentless anxiety and lack of rest finally caught up with me, and exhaustion overcame my defenses. I drifted into a deep sleep, only to wake the next morning in our bed with RPA’s arms wrapped tightly around me. He apologized, his voice soft as he said, “Hon, I’m so sorry I scared you. I love you so much.” Despite his words, I could only make myself go stiff, turning to look at my side of the bed. I wished for a normal mattress instead of the waterbed mattress with high frame and its dark red bumper pads, and longed to slip free from his iron grip, desperate for distance and safety.

The fragile peace between us lasted only about a month. During that time, I found myself having to accompany RPA everywhere he went, even when I desperately wanted to be alone. On one particular day, as we drove down the road in his Trans-Am, he reached across the center console, took my hand in his, and pressed a kiss to the back of it. As he did, he whispered that he loved me. He explained that his cold, distant exterior came from his experiences in the USMC, as if that justified everything.

That day, I learned the real reason he wanted me with him. We drove down I-25 and pulled into the parking lot near PetSmart, where a new store had just opened—a gun store. When we parked, I turned to look at him, searching his face for any hint of his intentions. RPA just smiled and said, “Come on, sweetheart, we need a few of them in the house. You know I’m from Texas—it’s good to have a couple around.” The only thought running through my mind was that we lived in the middle of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a city with plenty of police and, undoubtedly, plenty of guns already.

He took my hand and held the door open for me as we walked inside. RPA picked out a shotgun first, then led me over to where the handguns were displayed. Standing there, a chill ran through me—despite it being a warm June day, it felt as if I were standing on the side of Pikes Peak, buried in an eight-foot snowdrift wearing nothing but a bikini and socks. The sensation was so strong it was as if a rabbit had just run over my grave.

After browsing for a while, RPA selected a 9mm Glock. I can still picture that gun: black, with a hint of dark blue shining under the store lights. As the clerk worked on the paperwork, a sense of dread settled over me. My first thought was, “F@ck, I’m going to die.” When the salesclerk finally placed the Glock back in its box, I looked up and caught his eye. In that glance, I saw everything—an unspoken apology, a silent acknowledgment of my fear.

In the days following our unsettling trip to the gun store, I found myself unable to recover emotionally. The tension lingered, never giving me a moment to breathe. Within a week, RPA had disappeared again. There was more that strip club in Colorado Springs at the time, and since RPA was banned from one, I asked Jess to follow him. She called me from a pay phone and confirmed my suspicions—RPA was at another club, this one closer to Fort Carson.

Hearing the familiar roar of the Trans-Am as it pulled into our parking lot sent my nerves into overdrive. I couldn’t take it anymore. I moved quickly to the bottom of the stairs and opened the front door just as RPA entered through the glass screen door. He looked at me with a strange expression, then sat down heavily on the couch. Without warning, he turned to me and demanded, “What the f@ck is your problem now?”

The tension in the house had reached a breaking point. The Glock, no longer hidden away in the downstairs closet, now sat out in the open on the coffee table, its presence impossible to ignore and deeply unsettling. I felt utterly depleted; every ounce of energy drained from my body. And  I sat down in the middle of the staircase with a heavy weight, the weight of everything pressing down on my shoulders. Slowly, I gripped two of the staircase posts, more for emotional support than physical stability, and took a shaky breath and looked at RPA throw the wooden vertical spindles of the staircase. My voice came out small and tired as I finally spoke: “I’m tired, R,” I said quietly. “I can’t do this anymore. In the morning, please drop me off at the homeless shelter. You win.”

RPA remained seated on the couch, his gaze fixed on me with an intensity that was both unsettling and unyielding. It was as if my words had landed a physical blow—his face drained of color, the shock evident in his features. That pale expression quickly shifted, and his complexion transformed, flushed with pure, unmistakable rage. In a chilling response to the emotional confrontation, RPA reached over and picked up the Glock, his actions underscoring the volatility of the moment. RPA's demeanor shifted abruptly as he pointed the gun at me, his eyes narrowed with anger. His voice was sharp and accusatory as he snarled, “What the f@ck did you say to me?” The sudden outburst shattered whatever fragile calm had existed, amplifying the tension in the room. The intensity of his reaction left me feeling cornered and vulnerable, uncertain of what might happen next.

RPA fixed me with a hard stare and declared, “You are mine.” The words echoed with chilling finality, reinforcing the sense of ownership he held over me. I remained rooted to the spot, paralyzed by fear, convinced that any movement—no matter how slight—could have provoked RPA to unpredictable violence. The possibility that he might shoot me, perhaps even just for his own twisted amusement, kept me utterly still. In that moment, the threat was palpable, and my only instinct was to avoid drawing his attention further.

The tense standoff between us was finally interrupted when RPA let out a chilling, evil laugh. He locked eyes with me, his expression filled with menace, and made it explicitly clear that I would not be allowed to leave him—at least, not until he decided it was acceptable. His words were firm and controlling, reinforcing the sense of entrapment that had come to define our relationship. In that moment, any hope I had of escaping was crushed under the weight of his authority and the unmistakable message that my freedom depended solely on his permission.

As the shock wore off overwhelmed by terror, I rushed upstairs and immediately locked the bedroom door. Determined to create a barrier between myself and any potential threat, I barricaded both entrances: one that led to the bathroom and the other to the upstairs landing of our townhouse. The only time I dared to unlock either door was when Missy, my cat, meowed insistently to come inside. I opened the door , I let her in, grateful for the comfort of her company. I slept on the floor, positioning of the waterbed between myself and the barricaded doors, hoping it would offer some sense of protection.

That night, sleep eluded me entirely. Paralyzed by fear, I lay on the floor next to Missy, my heart pounding with every sound that echoed through the house. Each creak and footstep sent my thoughts racing, convinced that RPA was coming upstairs to continue what he had begun earlier that evening. The anxiety was relentless, and I remained on high alert, unable to let my guard down for even a moment.

The next morning, I moved through the house with extreme caution, each step down the stairs feeling as if I were walking on eggshells. My only goal was to avoid waking RPA, who was passed out on the couch. With every careful movement, my mind churned with escape plans—desperately searching for a way out of the townhouse and onto a bus that would take me downtown to the homeless shelter. Each obstacle intensified my anxiety: I realized I needed money for the fare, but using my bank card was out of the question. RPA could easily track any transaction, and the bus stop across from our bank provided a direct route downtown, raising the risk of being seen or intercepted. I mentally mapped out possible hiding places if things went wrong, and though the thought of calling my sister for help crossed my mind, the overwhelming anxiety made that option seem impossible.

My wallet—a small, black and silver lifeline—sat just a few feet away from me. Reaching it felt as daunting as crossing a deep ravine without a bridge. I crept quietly across the living room, inching toward the wallet and the hope of freedom it symbolized. Halfway there, I stopped and glanced back, needing to be sure RPA was still asleep. But I was horribly mistaken. His hazel eyes were open, watching me. In that instant, my hope vanished. The wallet, my only means of escape, now seemed impossibly out of reach. Before I could react, RPA rose from the couch.

He closed the distance between us in three long strides, his imposing presence magnified by the physical disparity between us. Standing at just 5'5"", I was completely overshadowed by his six-foot frame and solid build. The difference in our sizes was undeniable, and as he towered over me, the reality of my situation became unmistakably clear—I was utterly trapped.

The memory of that moment still lingers painfully, a dull throb pulsing at the back of my head each time I recall it. I remember the exact instant RPA woke up; there was no warning before he was upon me. In one swift, overpowering movement, he pinned me tightly against the closed downstairs bathroom door. His hand—so much larger than mine—easily seized both of my wrists, forcing my arms above my head and holding them there with an iron grip. The weight of his body pressed into me, rendering any attempt at escape impossible. Leaning down so that his mouth was close to my ear, RPA whispered in a cold, mocking tone, “Where are you going, sweetheart?” The menace behind his words was unmistakable, and the sense of helplessness in that moment remains vivid and raw.

With his free hand, RPA slid his fingers up my shirt, rubbing my chest as he whispered in a low purr, “Come, love. I have missed you so much. I just want to make love to you again and prove that my love for you is real.” His touch was invasive, and his words rang hollow given the tension and fear that filled the house.

RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my life.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle RPA stopped rubbing my chest and then gripped my chin to make sure I was looking up at him, his smile turning wicked. He demanded a kiss, insisting that we forget the last few months, declaring, “You are my l.” Ignoring my resistance, he forced me into a kiss—not a gentle gesture, but a harsh act. He refused a kiss on the cheek, instead forcing my mouth open and pressing his lips to mine in a French kiss I did not want.

Instinct took over as I tried to defend myself, aiming my knee toward RPA's groin in a desperate attempt to break free. But he was quick; he anticipated my move and blocked it by positioning his own knee between my legs. My effort at resistance failed, heightening my sense of helplessness and leaving me feeling even more powerless in the moment.

As the tension mounted, it was as if my silent plea for rescue was answered by the sharp beeping of RPA's pager echoing from the coffee table. The interruption was sudden, providing a brief window of relief. RPA released his grip, and I slid down against the door, my body trembling from both exhaustion and the overwhelming sense of relief.

RPA walked over to the coffee table, picked up the pager, and studied the number displayed. He sighed in frustration and muttered that he needed to take the call. Before leaving, he grabbed my wallet and keys, ensuring I could not escape while he was gone. Then, with determination, he headed for the front door. The familiar roar of the Trans-Am filled the air as he started the engine, pulled out of his parking spot, and sped away, leaving me shaken but alone.

Alone at last, I crawled into the downstairs bathroom, overwhelmed by a wave of nausea that soon overtook me. After vomiting, I ran upstairs, desperate to rid myself of the lingering taste and sensation. I brushed my teeth—once, then again—trying to reclaim a small measure of control and comfort.

1r3bhi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r3bhi7/if_youre_launching_a_mushroom_drink_mix/,"If you’re launching a mushroom drink mix (sachets/jars), here’s a pre-launch checklist that reduces the most common bad reviews","This is about powdered drink mixes (coffee/cacao/matcha sachets or jars), not RTD bottles.

Also: this isn’t a health-claim post. It’s a formulation/process checklist based on common failure patterns in powder mixes and what customers tend to report (taste, texture, mixability, consistency).

A lot of products disappoint not because mushrooms are “fake,” but because serving-size math + powder behavior weren’t designed intentionally.

Here’s a practical checklist to run before spending money on multiple rounds of sampling.

1. Do the “active budget” math (many blends break here)

Most servings are 6–12 g total powder. 

If your product includes a base + creamer + sweetener + flavors + extras, the mushroom fraction often becomes whatever is left. 

Quick sanity check:

•      If you list 5–8 mushrooms in an 8–10 g serving and you have creamer/sweetener, each mushroom is often a token allocation unless you explicitly design for grams/mg.

•      If your positioning is “functional,” consider designing around 1–2 hero mushrooms, then build flavor around that (not the other way around).

Simple decision:

•      Want a clearer, more consistent customer-reported experience? Keep the stack simpler and allocate dose intentionally.

•      Want “great taste + daily ritual”? You can go lighter, but align expectations with the format.

2) Powder vs extract: pick the tool that matches your goal 

Many labels blur “fruiting body powder” and “extract” like they’re interchangeable. They aren’t.

In powder mixes:

•      Powders: easier story, usually cheaper, often weaker per gram.

•      Extracts: stronger per gram, but more risk on taste/texture and they can sediment.

Actionable rule: decide early whether this is a taste-first ritual product or a dose-forward functional product, and align your ingredient plan (and expectations) accordingly.

3) Powder behavior: run 3 cup tests that often correlate with negative reviews

You don’t need a lab to catch most failures. You need a cup + a stopwatch. 

Test A — Wetting / clump test (30 seconds)

•      Add powder to liquid the way a customer would.

•      Stir 10 seconds.

•      Red flag: dry islands that won’t wet or stubborn clumps. 

Test B — Sediment test (10 minutes)

•      Stir normally.

•      Let sit 10 minutes.

•      Red flag: thick sludge layer or ugly separation most customers will notice. 

Test C — Re-stir test

•      After 10 minutes, stir again.

•      Red flag: it breaks into gritty chunks or stays “muddy” in an unpleasant way. 

If you hit these red flags, it often shows up later as texture complaints / low repeat purchase / refunds (even if the ingredient itself is fine).

4) Taste masking vs active allocation: know what you’re “buying” with your grams 

Every gram you allocate to:

•      creamers (coconut milk powder, etc.)

•      sweeteners

This isn’t a value judgment — it’s just constraints. 

Common pattern:

Great taste → low active allocation → “I don’t notice anything” feedback → discounting → margin pressure.

5) “Kitchen sink extras” increase complexity before the core is proven 

MCT + collagen + herbs + amino acids + probiotics can sound premium, but they also add:

•      taste interactions

•      flow/caking risk

•      higher COGS

•      fuzzier positioning

Practical approach: prove one clear use-case first. Add extras only if they measurably improve the product experience (or simplify positioning), not just the label.

6) Don’t leave compliance until after the formula is “done” 

If your label story relies on claims you can’t safely use in your target market, you’ll end up reformulating late.

Practical move: lock market + claim boundaries early, then build around what you can actually support.

 When RPA returned, his demeanor had completely changed—he was pale and visibly shaken. He sat down heavily on our worn-out couch, clearly struggling to process what he had just learned. With a trembling voice, he explained that the note was from his mother, who had managed to locate him by using information from my previous job. During their conversation, she told him that his father had passed away and that she was already on her way to see him.

Mrs. A turned to RPA and, with genuine concern, asked why he hadn’t called to let his family know that he had gotten remarried. I was already aware that RPA had been married twice before me, so her question did not surprise me. Then, she asked when we had gotten married, and I told her it was in December of the previous year. Mrs. A smiled warmly at me and welcomed me into the family, her kindness leaving a lasting impression.

During our conversation, Mrs. A mentioned she wanted to set up a trust for RPA’s son. Sitting on the couch, I was taken aback; it became clear that she was unaware of her grandson’s fate. I turned to RPA and asked him if his mother truly did not know. Mrs. A looked at both of us, confusion evident in her expression. RPA then quietly told his mother that his only child had died, explaining that this tragedy was due to the poor choices of his first ex-wife.

 

Mrs. A’s reaction to the devastating news was immediate and profound. Her face turned ghostly pale, and if RPA and his brother had not been present, she might have collapsed right there in our living room. Recognizing her distress, I hurried into the kitchen and fetched her a glass of cold water, hoping it might help her steady. As the initial shock began to fade and the reality of her only grandchild’s death settled in, Mrs. A’s gaze fell upon a gold, well-worn picture frame sitting nearby. The frame held a cherished photograph of RPA’s son, illuminated by the soft glow of a blue candle. In my family, lighting a candle is a tradition that honors a child lost to death—a quiet act of remembrance.

Mrs. A turned to me, her voice trembling, and asked if the candle meant what she feared. I found myself unable to speak, so I simply nodded. Understanding washed over her as she gently picked up the picture, her hands shaking. She turned to RPA and, with heartbreak in her voice, asked why he had never called to tell her, or if he had ever informed his father. RPA quietly apologized and told his mother that he had never told his father either.

As 1997 approached, I found myself dreading the holidays. I never celebrated Christmas at the time, as it brought up other traumas from my childhood. When New Year’s Day arrived, it marked the beginning of subtle but significant changes in RPA’s behavior. The cracks in his carefully maintained mask became more apparent, especially after he received his settlements from his father’s estate.

When the weather permitted, RPA, long with his family we drove up to the land his father had owned near the Four Corners. This visit turned out to be both the first and last time I met my father-in-law. I helped scatter Mr. A’s ashes on the land, and as I walked back toward our cars, my eyes caught sight of animal bones—bleached white by the sun, stark against the cold and dark landscape. That image should have been a warning of what was to come.

Once all the checks from the estate cleared, I began to notice real changes in RPA. At that time, I was still working at Walmart but had been put on swing shifts. That’s when one of my “ghosts” from the past reappeared. I was joking around with my friend Jess in the store on Ash Wednesday, she couldn’t respond, something hit me so hard that it felt like my brain wanted to leap out of my skull and run a marathon around the store. It was then that I learned, because of that ghost from my past used my head as a hammer against the floor more than once years earlier, I had sustained brain damage. That day, I experienced my very first epileptic seizure, a challenge that would stay with me until this day.

Losing my job at Walmart marked a difficult turning point, especially as my doctors were still struggling to find the right medication for my condition. It was during this period of uncertainty that RPA’s true character began to emerge.

Once his settlement checks were cleared, RPA suddenly had nearly $250,000 at his disposal. Instead of using the money sensibly, he indulged himself with extravagant purchases. The first was a 1980’s Burgundy Trans-Am, complete with a gold Firebird emblazoned on the hood a turbo engine under the hood—a detail I remember vividly, the car’s driver’s side paint had rust near the back tire frame, a result of the harsh winter road salts in Colorado.

RPA’s spending did not end with the purchase of the car; he soon acquired a new computer as well. While I struggled to adjust to my health challenges and sought ways to cope, RPA retreated upstairs for hours at a time, painting his models and immersing himself in cybersex chat rooms with countless women. You may wonder how I discovered this. My curiosity eventually got the better of me one afternoon, and I sat down to read through some of the chat exchanges. What I found left me feeling deeply unsettled.

I went through those messages after RPA had left the house to purchase another model. Shortly afterward, I heard the distinct sound of his car returning to the parking lot. By that time, we were living in a townhouse on Yuma Street, a place I had chosen because it was still within my budget. I listened as the front door opened and closed, and heard him coming up the stairs toward me.

I sat in silence, unable to find the words to express what I felt as I stared at the computer screen and then at RPA. With tears streaming down my face, I finally managed to ask him one question: ""Why?"" RPA glanced at the computer, then at me, and his anger flared. He grabbed my arm, pulled me out of the chair, and snarled that I should mind my own business. Without another word, he shoved me out of the room and locked the door behind him.

My past experiences had taught me to keep my emotions bottled up, fearing that reacting might result in another violent outburst—perhaps even a blow to my face. So, I remained silent. Each night, I went to bed alone and woke with RPA snoring beside me. The medication I was on required me to eat, though I hated it, especially with the stress weighing on me. Most mornings, I would head downstairs, turn the TV  on low in hopes of not disturbing RPA, and work quietly on my cross-stitching.

On the third day after our confrontation, RPA began shouting, ""Jean, where are you?"" He hurried downstairs, still dressed in his boxer briefs, and sat on the coffee table in front of me. He touched my leg and apologized for overreacting. I simply nodded and returned to my cross-stitch pattern, recognizing his behavior as the beginning of his guilt phase.

A few weeks later, I unexpectedly crossed paths with my old friend Chris at the 7-11. We had been friends since grade school, and seeing him again after all those years brought a sense of comfort and familiarity during an otherwise turbulent time in my life.

Later that evening, Chris stopped by our apartment for a cup of coffee. While we sat together at the dining room table, catching up and sharing memories, RPA was upstairs, preoccupied as usual with his cybersex chat rooms. Suddenly, RPA must have heard our voices from downstairs because he stormed into the room, visibly furious. His anger was unmistakable as he demanded to know who the man sitting at the table was. I tried to calmly explain that Chris was just an old friend from years ago, but RPA was not interested in listening to any explanation. He abruptly told Chris to leave the apartment.

As Chris got up to go, he quietly slipped a piece of paper into my hand. In a low voice, he told me I could call him anytime—day or night—if I ever needed anything. With that, he left, and I was once again left alone with RPA and the mounting tension in our home.

As soon as Chris left, the atmosphere in the apartment shifted abruptly. RPA slammed the front door with force, his anger palpable as he approached me. His presence was menacing, and, without hesitation, he seized both my arms in a tight grip. He fixed his gaze on me and declared, ""Listen to me, Jean. You are mine, my wife. You are nothing without me. Got it?"" The intensity of his words and the aggression in his actions sent a wave of fear through me, a feeling I hadn't experienced in years. I was deeply shaken, unable to find comfort or safety in my own home. That night, unable to face him or share the same bed, I chose to sleep on the couch, wrestling with anxiety and uncertainty about what might happen next.

The following morning brought a stark change in RPA's demeanor. Standing quietly over me, he appeared contemplative, his anger from the previous night replaced by a somber and regretful expression. His eyes reflected a deep sadness as he began to speak, offering an apology for his outburst.

Seeking to explain his behavior, RPA delved into the painful experiences of his past. He recounted memories from his previous marriages, describing the emotional wounds that still lingered. He spoke of one ex-wife, whom he held responsible for the tragic loss of his only child—a grief that seemed to haunt him. He also mentioned another marriage that had ended prematurely due to infidelity, leaving him with feelings of betrayal and disappointment.

As he finished sharing these memories, RPA reached out and gently touched my cheek, softly saying, ""Sorry, babe."" The sudden shift from anger to remorse left me feeling emotionally drained. I found myself struggling to navigate the cycle of fear and apology that had come to define our relationship, unsure of how to process the conflicting emotions that now surrounded us.

 

Less than a month after the confrontation, I began noticing troubling changes in RPA's behavior. He stopped wearing his wedding band, claiming he had lost it during a softball game. At first, I wanted to believe him, but a nagging doubt lingered in my mind.

Soon, his absences grew longer and more frequent. RPA would come home later and later,  until the point he came home between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, the time the strip clubs closed. Trust m,e I called one club to ask what the hours were. Each time, my gut instinct told me something was wrong. I tried paging him, hoping for a response, but only silence greeted me—nothing but dead air.

Driven by mounting anxiety and suspicion, I reached for the phone book, desperate to find answers about RPA’s whereabouts and the truth behind his late night came into the light.

 

In my desperation to uncover the truth, I closed my eyes and ran my finger down the phone book listings for local strip clubs. On the first number I finally, I mustered the courage to make a call. When someone answered—a man with a deep, gruff voice—I asked if he could help me, but he said he couldn’t. Refusing to give up, I pressed on, describing RPA’s appearance: light jeans, a tan shirt, and a red baseball cap. Suddenly, there was silence on the other end of the line. I took a deep breath and made my intentions clear and asked if man could pass a message on for me: if that man in that outfit wasn’t home within twenty minutes, there would be consequences meaning my bat  would meet his models. Then I hung up, waiting anxiously for what would happen next.

My frustration and desperation to reach RPA finally reached a boiling point. Determined to get through to him in a way that words could not, I marched upstairs to were he keep his  treasured model collection—his pride and joy, and possessions that meant more to him than almost anything else in our home. One by one, I carefully gathered the models, arranging them in a deliberate line across the downstairs area. These weren’t just small collectibles; they were impressive half-scale battleships and aircraft carriers, each one substantial in size. The smallest among them, the Arizona, stretched the entire length of my arm.

With all the models lined up in plain sight on the coffee table and the floor, I took my softball bat and readied myself for a practice swing. The message was unmistakable in both my actions and my resolve: I was prepared to use his expensive models as targets should he continue to ignore me and my growing distress. The threat was clear and direct—if RPA remained indifferent, his beloved collection would bear the consequences. In that moment, I wanted him to understand just how serious and determined I was to finally be heard.

Sure enough, within just fifteen minutes, I heard the familiar rumble of his Trans-Am pulling into the parking lot. He must have driven recklessly and broken several traffic laws because, under normal circumstances, it would have taken at least forty-five minutes for him to reach the front door from where he was. I turned off all the lights in the apartment and sat in the darkness, waiting for him on the couch with a softball bat placed prominently on the coffee table in front of me. As RPA burst in, flushed and out of breath, he immediately turned on the lights and began screaming at me, calling me crazy. I looked him straight in the eyes and replied with a sarcastic remark, pointing out just how quickly he had returned home. Then, with a snarl, I let him know that I was fully aware of the truth behind his late-night escapades. Without another word, I got up, headed upstairs, locked the bedroom door, and went to sleep. For the next couple of days, RPA barely left the house. He knew that I was serious, and that I had no qualms about treating his cherished models as mere pieces of plastic—items he had spent far too much money on—if he pushed me any further.

As time passed, RPA's true nature began to emerge more clearly. He installed a lock on the door where he kept his prized model collection, a move that seemed to signal a deeper change in his behavior. The unmistakable signs of infidelity soon followed. RPA would return home late at night, his clothing and even his skin reeking of cheap body spray. Sometimes, his bare skin sparkled with traces of body glitter—evidence he made little effort to hide. 

 Then one night, I heard that Trans-Am pull in front of our townhouse, and he walked in with some girl in stripper heels. She sat down on my white couch after that night. I wanted to burn that couch after she plopped her nasty, rotten crotch down her skirt. I could tell she did not have any underwear on.

As the tension in the room mounted, our cat wandered in, leaping up onto the coffee table. She settled herself among the chaos, her calm, unblinking gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before her. For a moment, her silent presence provided an odd sense of grounding, a reminder of normalcy in the midst of emotional turmoil. The cat simply observed everything from her perch on the coffee table, as if silently judging the absurdity of it all, while the rest of us grappled with the intensity of the situation.  Then it turned to me and made a statement that made my blood boil.

 

“You should be grateful your brother loves your retarded ass to let you stay in his home. “Without uttering a single word, I rose from my seat and walked into the kitchen. All the while, she continued to talk loudly, boasting about how RPA was paying her rent and covering her overdue car payments. She went on to say that once she moved into our home, both the cat and I would be forced out. According to her, she had no intention of living with a disabled person, and as for the cat, she made it clear that her dislike for felines meant our pet would have to leave as well. She even mentioned that she didn’t want any of her fellow dancers coming into a house with either of us there, describing how she intended to make the place her own—completely disregarding the life I had built and the home I shared with RPA.

 I walked over to the ledge between the living room and our small kitchen, where I kept my wallet. Carefully, I pulled out my ID, determined to have proof ready for what was about to unfold. My next thought was for Missy, our cat. I put down food for her, wanting to make sure she was safe and out of the way—especially since the woman sitting on my couch was about to face the consequences of her actions, and I didn’t want Missy anywhere near the chaos.

After ensuring Missy was occupied, I went to the cabinet above the microwave where I kept our important papers. I retrieved our marriage license, another piece of evidence to support my side of the story. The last thing I grabbed was the bat from the closet downstairs, a clear signal of my intent and the seriousness of the situation.

As I made my way back to where she sat, I recalled the urban legend that if a wife caught her husband cheating, she could kill both of them and somehow avoid jail time. It was just a myth, but the thought echoed the intensity of my emotions at that moment. Adding to my confidence was the knowledge that, at the time, Colorado had the “Make My Day” law on the books. Anyone who was uninvited or a stranger entering a home without permission, especially when not listed on the lease, had no legal right to be there. She certainly didn't have mine.

As I approached the woman sitting on my couch, her short skirt riding high, I could see her thong. She glanced up at me and turned noticeably pale. I realized that the look on my face must have terrified her—it was a cold, almost murderous smile. In that moment, I declared, “Really, I don’t have a brother—just a little sister,” and then pointed upstairs, clarifying that RPA actually just had an older brother. Without hesitation, I tossed my ID and our marriage license at her. She picked up the documents and examined them, her confusion mounting as she realized the truth of our relationship.

When she noticed the softball bat in my hands, I struck it against the arm of the couch, the impact reverberating through my bones. I warned her with steely resolve, “You have ten seconds—and nine of them are gone—to get the hell out of my house.” In a panic, she screamed and tumbled off the couch, crawling desperately toward the base of the staircase. One hof er heels snapped as she scrambled toward the front door, shrieking when the bat landed just inches from her feet.

At that moment, RPA came rushing downstairs, clad only in a towel and still dripping from his shower. I looked up at him and, with all the sarcasm I could muster, said, “I know incest is still illegal in the state of Colorado. When did I become your sister—since my maiden name is Eades, not A—” I pointed the bat at the woman again and announced, “Time’s up.” Raising the bat, I prepared to drive my point home as she cowered at the doorway.

 

In the chaos that followed, RPA grabbed the bat from my hands. He stared at the woman on the floor, her heavy makeup smeared and tears streaming down her face, before telling her to wait in the car. Turning to me, RPA accused me of acting crazy, then hurried off to put on some clothes. Undeterred, I followed him up the stairs and let out the most menacing laugh I could manage, warning him that he hadn’t seen crazy yet—and that he soon would see it.

The confrontation between us hit a boiling point as RPA, growing more agitated, raised his voice in an attempt to justify his behavior. He insisted that the woman was ""just a job,"" as though those words alone would erase the betrayal and turmoil he had brought into our home. I refused to let his excuses go unchallenged. Planting myself firmly in the center of the room, I crossed my arms and met his gaze with unwavering resolve. My voice remained steady, but there was no mistaking the firmness in my tone as I laid out the reality he was trying so hard to avoid. I made it clear that he, not the woman, was the one making the payments, and that those payments were for much more than the so-called arrangement he claimed. I recited, point by point, the explicit nature of what those payments truly represented, determined not to let him sidestep responsibility for his actions. Unable to face the truth, RPA hurriedly got dressed, his frustration mounting. He stormed out of the house, the sharp sound of the front door slamming behind him, leaving a resounding echo in the tense silence that followed.

The stress from the evening’s confrontation took its toll almost immediately, manifesting as a sharp, relentless headache that made it difficult to think clearly. Overwhelmed, I reached for the phone and called my friend Jess, desperate for a sympathetic ear. I tried to recount the events that had just transpired, but before I could finish explaining, my body betrayed me—a massive grand mal seizure seized control, cutting our conversation short. Thankfully, Jess was there for me in my moment of vulnerability. She managed to help me upstairs and get me safely into bed, despite my stubborn refusal to go to the hospital. The thought of another medical bill—one more burden to add to the stack—was simply too much for me to bear, so I insisted on staying home, clinging to the comfort of familiar surroundings and Jess’s steady presence.

**The Fourth Tape**  
  
  
A letter found in the abandoned office of Dr. Benedict Harlan, April 4th, 1962  
  
  
If you are reading this letter, then I have probably failed, but I'd like to register that I have solved it first.  
  
  
When I was a young researcher at the Dalton Linguistics Institute in New Mexico, I believed language was the noblest work of man. A system of sounds carrying meaning across the void between one mind and another. I spent my days recording dying tongues, preserving the speech of peoples whose children had forgotten how to shape the words of their ancestors. It was good work. I was proud of it.  
  
Then the tapes arrived from Antarctica.  
  
  
The Institute received materials from government expeditions. Usually, these came with proper documentation, forms signed and stamped. But this package bore no paperwork. A wooden chest marked by ice and water, seven magnetic reels inside, and a single sheet with coordinates and a date: March 1961. The rest had been blacked out with ink so thick it warped the paper.  
I brought it to my office on the third floor. The Institute was built after the war, all concrete and fluorescent light. My window faced another concrete wall. I had worked there for ten years and no longer searched for a view.  
The first three reels contained what I expected. Atmospheric recordings, equipment tests, fragments of conversation between expedition members whose voices grew tired and weaker as the dates progressed. I made notes drinking coffee that had gone cold.  
  
  
But the fourth reel was different.  
  
It began with recorded silence then a voice: ""Acoustic sample, second try."" Then I could hear movement for about two minutes, air passing through, the microphone touching surfaces like it was sliding on the ice. The echoes around appeared to have become heavier. A pause. Then a sound. Then one minute of silence again. Then that scratching and moving sound again.  
  
  
I stopped the tape. Rewound it. Played it again.  
  
The sound lasted a few seconds. It was not static. It was not wind or mechanical failure. It was a phoneme, maybe? But it belonged to no language I had ever encountered. Something strange and uncanny. ""Otherworldly,"" I remember thinking at that moment, impossible to explain.  
I played it again. And again. And again, until that sound was recorded inside my head. What a fool I was. How innocent.  
The phoneme seems to exist in a way that should not be possible for human anatomy. It involved articulations that, if possible, seemed to originate from deeper than the larynx. No human vocal tract could produce something like it. I tried to transcribe it using the International Phonetic Alphabet, but the symbols I chose were approximations, it looks like something childish, undeveloped, closer to something that resisted representation.  
I tried to reproduce it myself, alone in my office at two in the morning. I produced only a strangled cough.  
I did not sleep that night. When I closed my eyes, I heard the phoneme continuing, as if it had not stopped when I lifted the playback head from the tape.  
  
Then, within a week, I identified it in my own speech.  
It happened first during a faculty meeting. A tedious discussion of funding that I attended without paying attention. I was speaking about the Antarctic findings, carefully omitting the fourth reel, when suddenly I felt my tongue move in a way I had not intended, my mind blanked for a second, and the sound that emerged was brief, almost invisible, in the form of a glottal insertion between two ordinary syllables. No one seemed to notice. But I noticed. I heard myself produce something that had no place in any phonology I have ever seen.  
It occurred again three days later, during a telephone call with my sister in Boston. And again during a lecture to graduate students. And again, appearing in the gaps between my words like a refrain I could not unlearn.  
  
I decided to record myself. My lectures.  
The tapes confirmed what I feared. The sound was spreading through my speech like an infection. At first it appeared once per hour of conversation. Then once every thirty minutes. Then every ten. Each occurrence was slightly different, as if the sound were learning to fit itself more naturally into the way I speak.  
My colleagues began to notice.  
""You have developed an odd verbal tic,"" Dr. Walter told me in the hallway. ""Stress, perhaps.""  
  
But I could not stop. I listened to the fourth reel every day, sometimes for hours, trying to understand what was speaking and why it had chosen this phoneme. What is it about? What had produced it beneath the ice?  
The answer came to me in February, during a long night in my office with the tape running on repeat.  
  
With a thrill in my spine, I realized the phoneme might not be a simple sound, or ordinary word. It could be a name.  
I almost broke down in despair at this moment. How ignorant I was. The time I realized it I had strange visions of things I cannot express, images as strange as the sound, colossal beings moving across places that could not be ""reality"". I was calling something, over and over. Could it hear me?  
  
  
I had been speaking it for months. Broadcasting it into the air of my office, my apartment, the corridors of the Institute. Broadcasting it to something that had been waiting for guidance for a very long time. That thing I was calling, I think I understand now, has been waiting for a location between dimensions of different understanding about time and space. Whatever called it under the ice was trying to give it a location.  
  
  
In March, government men came for my research.  
I gave them everything. The notebooks, the tape reels, the spectrographic analyses. I answered their questions with the calm of exhaustion. I did not tell them it was too late. The phoneme was already spreading through the Institute, appearing in the speech of secretaries and janitors and graduate students who had never heard the recordings. I could hear it everywhere now.  
  
I am writing this letter on what I believe will be my last night in this building. I can hear the cleaning woman in the hallway, and in her humming I detect the name, carefully infused into her melody without her knowledge.  
  
I cannot stop my research. I will look for it. It is part of me now, I am the one who unraveled this mystery. I do not know what will come through the door I have opened. I do not know if anything needs to come through, or if the opening itself is sufficient, but if it happens, if something does come, I am the one who will welcome it.  
I ask only this of you, whoever finds this letter: listen carefully to your own voice. Pay attention to the sounds you make between words. If you hear something unfamiliar, something that does not belong to the language you learned as a child, don't be afraid of it... it's wonderful. But do not dare try to understand it. It's mine.  
  
  
Dr. Harlan was last seen leaving the Dalton Institute on March 15th, 1962. His apartment was found empty, his personal effects undisturbed. The official report listed his disappearance as unexplained.  
In the months that followed, researchers at the Institute occasionally reported acoustic anomalies in their recordings. A strange sound that appeared without explanation, it seems to spread from voice to voice.  
People ""complained of auditory disturbances"". None could describe what they heard. But some of them, in the weeks and months that followed, began to speak differently.

i feel like almost everyone here is looking for a personal clown or a babysitter instead of an online friend which is just...lame?

im into art(paintings, films etc..), music that was made way before i was born, philosophy, casual gaming, films & shows, spirituality, conspiracy theories, anything horror related or just odd ig????, some sports, late night walks, the smell of rain، ice coffee and soda???.....aaaand emojis. i love emojis more than housewives on facebook do..among other things

i dont believe we need to share interests to be able to have a proper, semi-interesting conversation so please don't let that discourage you from reaching out ☺️

extra stuff you don't need to know but wouldn't hurt if you do:

1) my timezone is gmt +4. i don't really mind the timezone difference but just in case you do.

2) id like to think im a non-judgemental(unless you're a cat person...kidding but not really), affectionate, and caring person but that's just moi💅🙂‍↕️

3) your age isn't really an issue as long as you're 18+ and somewhat mature. definitely dont mind older peeps. ++ if you're an arab but that's not a must whatsoever 😇

4) please send a small intro about yourself instead of lazy ""Hi"" or ""Hru"". dont beee like that???",0,1770944854.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I really don't have anyone to tell. So I've been friends these girls for two years now. It's me C, S, and V. There use to be K. But k and I fell out because I didn't realize I was jealous of her. Very b**ch of me. I'm more self aware now and realize my mistakes. I know she hates me. Anf I don't blame her. I hope the best for K. Anyway. I'm having problems with V. She is friends and nice to everyone except me. She gaslights me. Is egocentric always talking about herself. Everything is a competition. Always trying to one up everything one says or does. She's always trying to humiliate me for things I do or say. I'm a pretty awkward person. And have no good social skills. So I can say weird things. Bury I can tell when theirs back handed comments or compliments. I always gave the benefit of the doubt. But if your friend does it everyday. And makes you cry. It's not funny. She's always giving me labels calling me bitter. The black nun. Annoying. Unsupportable. Imprudent among other things. I don't mess with anyone. And I don't think I'm imprudent when I keep to myself as best I can.  I once sipped her coffee. One sip. And she told me to keep it and then called me a rat all day. She's told me no one talks to me unless they need something from me. I wanted to leave and cry. My friend S said she has noticed. C. Said she didn't see or hear anything. I think it makes her an accomplice. Idk what to do. I don't think they are my friends. I always feel crazy or maybe I'm exaggerating. But I don't think friends make u question a friendship.",1,1770944709.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I’ve been reading through the Visit London Guide and the subreddits, and I already have the major sights on my list like the Natural History Museum, Big Ben, the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, and Tower Bridge.

I’m hoping to add a few more personal or local favorites to my itinerary. If you had to pick three experiences you genuinely love in London, what would they be?

For context, I’m especially drawn to bookstores, historic libraries, cathedrals, fortresses, beautiful viewpoints, cozy cafés, and places with strong character. I’m happy to travel outside central London if something is really worth it. I’m also not a big meat eater, so any vegetarian friendly food recommendations are appreciated, as well as great spots for coffee, cocktails, or desserts.

I’d love suggestions that feel local or memorable beyond the main tourist checklist. Thanks in advance.",1,1770944561.0,visitlondon,3,1.0,False

These tiny particles aren't just microplastics they're 1,000 times smaller. They can pass through your intestinal wall and enter your bloodstream.

Drinking one large coffee a day means ingesting roughly one plastic particle for every seven cells in your body. Solutions: bring your own cup, switch to iced coffee, or brew at home.",1,1770944507.0,SeniorCitizenTips,0,1.0,False

So this didn't happen to me, but to a friend of mine. Both of us are autistic and we really don't know what to make of this situation. I'd like to hear what might have happened from the perspective of people who might understand where the other party is coming from. 

My friend has been stopping by the same coffee stand for years now as it's the closest to her house. She gets a tea and tips generously (more than 20%). Before this incident she and the baristas have had a friendly customer service relationship, they smile and chat with her and know her regular order. The other day, as the barista was handing my friend the tea, a little bit spilled onto my friend's hand. The barista offered her a napkin, but my friend just laughed and said ""that's what my tongue is for"" and licked the little bit of tea off her hand. Now we can both understand that yes it was a little bit awkward, but as we see it, it was just a bit silly and in no way harmful. It's not like she said it seductively and wiggled her eyebrows at the barista, it was just a little brush-it-off thing. In my mind it's no weirder or more gross than licking BBQ sauce off your fingers at a restaurant. I mean there are places that provide bibs because the meal is so messy and you eat with your hands, so what's the matter with licking just a little bit of tea off the back of your hand?

Now for the past several days, the baristas have been giving my friend the cold shoulder, barely talking to her, and she said their smiles fade when they see that it's her. Then today, the tea they gave her was essentially hot water with a splash of creamer in it, which has never happened before. She gets the idea that they are trying to get her to stop coming to the stand. We absolutely do not understand what happened here. They're acting like she licked the barista's hand! This slightly awkward action was certainly not worth driving away a loyal and well-tipping customer in my mind. It was something I would have just laughed about. She doesn't want to lose this spot but they obviously don't want her there. Should she try to talk to them about it and apologize if it made them uncomfortable?

1r3b60k,https://www.reddit.com/r/yerbamate/comments/1r3b60k/the_saga_of_a_cardiac/,The saga of a cardiac,"Hi everyone, 

I have myocardial bridge, a condition where a segment of one of my coronary artery passes through my heart muscle. As a result of this, I have palpitations and angina (chest pain). The thing is, mate is a tradition and a heritage in my family. My father is gaucho, and although my mother isn’t, I’ve been raised by my father and mother drinking chimarrão all the time, I’ve been born and raised in the gaucho culture, and all the traditions there is with it. 

The thing is, as you can see, I have a condition that, in many cases, drinking caffeine isn’t the most healthy thing to do, but I don’t want to lose the tradition or to it stop on me. So, in the past few years I’ve been trying to find a way to “””safely””” (or at least mostly safe) to drink mate. Coffee isn’t a problem, but, for some reason, mate sometimes is. 

Thinking of that, I thought of sharing some techniques and experiences I’ve learned that helped me not having palpitations, or chest pain, while drinking my beloved mate, to someone who may also need them. 

**About the yerbas and their cuts**

1. On the cuts, the moagem grossa, for some reason, just jumpstarts my heart. Although google and every LLM out there says that moagem grossa has less caffeine per ML (because it seems to last longer), it’s just too strong for me;

2. About the types of Yerba, Brazilian ones are the most soft and safe that I’ve drinked. From Uruguayan cuts I’ve tried: Canaria’s (normal and Serena), Baldo and Esmeralda, all of them got me palpitations on the first sip. From Argentinian cuts I’ve tried: Rosamonte suave, La Merced Barbacua, Playadito, Mananita and Union Suave. Union Suave is the only one that didn’t give me palpitations. From Brazil, I’ve tried a lot of then, but the ones I’ve liked the most: Giotti, Seiva Pura, laço do mate and barão de cotegipe, all of then on their traditional cuts. 

3. When buying from Brazil, always prefer the ones that have the “Nativa” stamp. They are cultivated in the middle of the Atlantic forest, on areas with high indices of shadow and less sun, so they are also less rich in caffeine. 

**About the process of making the mate**

1. Use less Yerba. The common is to fill up to 2/3 of a gourd but, in my case, I fill up to 1,5/3 of my gourd (I use a gajeta and a imbuia one). Sometimes I also use some traditional Brazilian herbs like Erva-doce and Camomila (they relax your body and lower your blood pressure, so they minimize the effects of the caffeine). 

2. Always spit out the first fill, or give to someone. The more lavada the Yerba the less the caffeine per ml. 

3. Don’t use too hot water. The best temperatures for me are between 75-80 Celsius. The hotter the water, the more caffeine is drawn from the Yerba. 

**About how much i drink**

1. I usually drink around 500ml to 1L per day, on a maximum. Always on the evening or on the morning, never on both of them, nor at night. 

2. I never drink other source of caffeine when I plan on drinking mate. It’s coffee or mate, never both of them. I also tend to avoid other drinks like coke, Pepsi and even alcohol. 

I hope these tips help someone who needs them. Also, always keep in mind that your life is above anything, if there is no way to keep drinking it, just don’t do it. ",2,1770944321.0,yerbamate,0,1.0,False

1r3b2jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ceph2apod/comments/1r3b2jy/the_immediate_comp_reset_how_500_luxury_units/,The Immediate Comp Reset: How 500 Luxury Units Reprice Everything,"The moment Copper Mills' tower opens, every landlord within a half-mile radius will have brand-new ammunition for rent increases. Here's the mechanism: when 500 units start leasing at $3,000-$5,000/month (the developer's stated range), those prices become the new ""comparables"" that triple-decker landlords use to justify their own increases. Current Davis Square rents average $2,500-$3,200 for older units. But once the tower fills up—and in this market, it will fill up fast, probably within weeks—landlords will point to those prices and tell existing tenants: ""Well, the new building down the street is getting $4,250 for a one-bedroom. I'm only asking $3,400 for this renovated unit in a classic triple-decker. That's a steal!""

This isn't theoretical—it's exactly what happened in Union Square when Assembly Row opened, and what's happening across Somerville as each luxury building resets the price floor. Current rental data shows Davis Square apartments ranging from $2,158 for studios to $3,197 for two-bedrooms, with the overall average around $2,502-$2,726 per month. But those figures are about to be ancient history. Real estate agents will cite Copper Mills comps in every listing. Appraisers will use them for refinancing. And within 12-18 months, you'll see triple-decker rents that were $2,800 jump to $3,500+, not because the units got better, but because the market perception shifted. The building validates and locks in a new price tier permanently.

# The Density Premium: How 500+ New Residents Drive Up Everyone's Costs

Now add 500+ high-income residents to a 4-square-mile neighborhood, and watch what happens to the entire cost of living. These aren't abstract statistics—they're actual people who need groceries, coffee, dry cleaning, restaurants, gyms, and services. And every business in Davis Square knows it.

**Retail space gets bid up immediately.** Commercial rents in Somerville already average $37-$45 per square foot annually. But when a landlord can point to 500+ new luxury residents with disposable income within a two-block radius, they can demand premium rates. A coffee shop looking to open near the new tower? That's $50-60/sq ft now, not $37. A boutique gym targeting the Copper Mills demographic? $65/sq ft. Every retailer bidding for space near high density drives up commercial rents—and those costs get passed directly to customers. Your $4 coffee becomes $5.50. Your $12 sandwich becomes $15. The yoga studio raises membership from $120/month to $175 because their lease just jumped 40%.

**The service economy reprices around the new demographic.** When 500 units worth of tenants paying $4,000-$5,000/month move in, every service provider in the area recalibrates. The dry cleaner who charged $3.50 for a shirt now charges $5 because they know the market can bear it. The dog walker raises rates from $25 to $35 per walk. Hair salons, nail salons, gyms, bars—everyone adjusts to the new clientele's willingness to pay. And the existing residents who were already stretched? They either pay the new prices or leave the neighborhood entirely.

**Even parking becomes a pricing mechanism.** Copper Mill proposes minimal to no parking for 500+ units. Even if only half the residents own cars, that's 250+ vehicles—and here's the kicker: per city regulations, market-rate residents in new buildings can't get resident parking permits at all. So where do those cars go? They don't vanish. Those Copper Mills residents either pay $200-300/month for private garage parking, or they compete for triple-decker units that include parking spots. Suddenly, older buildings with off-street parking become premium rentals. A landlord with a triple-decker and two driveway spots knows they're sitting on gold—units that were $3,000/month are now $3,800 because parking is the scarce resource the luxury tower can't provide. The long-term tenant who bikes everywhere just got priced out by someone willing to pay extra for a spot they don't even use.

Meanwhile, existing permit holders watch their quality of life degrade. Five hundred units means constant delivery trucks, ride-shares, Ubers, visitors, moving vans—all competing for the same curb space. The grandmother on Holland Street who's parked near her building for 30 years now circles for 20 minutes because Copper Mills overflow has taken every spot within three blocks.

**The multiplier effect is permanent and cumulative.** These aren't temporary disruptions during construction. Once those 500 units are occupied, they permanently increase demand for every service, every retail space, every parking spot, every table at every restaurant. Density doesn't just add people—it multiplies pressure on fixed resources in a geographically constrained area. And in a market economy, that pressure translates directly into higher prices for everyone.

The landlords raising rents aren't villains—they're responding rationally to the new comps Copper Mills creates. The coffee shop charging $6 isn't greedy—they're covering their doubled commercial rent. The parking squeeze isn't a failure of planning—it's the predictable result of adding 250+ cars to a neighborhood with nowhere to put them and no permits to give them.

**This is the density premium in action: 500 luxury units don't just compete with existing housing—they reprice the entire neighborhood's cost of living, permanently.** Every comp comparison, every retail lease, every service transaction gets reset to reflect the new high-income demographic. And the people who were already struggling to afford Davis Square? They become the collateral damage of a development model that treats density as an unalloyed good while ignoring its role as a cost multiplier.",1,1770944060.0,u_ceph2apod,0,1.0,False

Home Alone 7: Marv's Revenge(?)

Kevin McAllister owns a home security business. (Get it?) The business is struggling. Kevin's young son/partner wants to take the company public or sell out to a bigger/rival company, Kevin doesn't want to. But they're gonna have to do something soon or they'll have to majorly downsize. It puts him at odds with his son.

Kevin sees a down on his luck and desperate Marv returning cans at the grocery store. They get coffee and talk for the first time in 20 years. Marv is reformed but struggling. Kevin offers Marv a job at his company as a janitor, Marv is thrilled. 

Kevin and Marv get along great. Marv's life starts to turn around. He's got a good job, he even finds a new gf. But he notices lately someone in a van (or something) seems to have been following him.

\------Act 1

Enter Harry Jr, Joe Pesci's son. He's bitter his father got a much tougher/longer sentence than Marv and his father died in jail. Now he wants revenge on Kevin.

He's gonna blackmail Marv the janitor, and force him to steal company financial info to give to the rival security company trying to acquire McAllister Home Security Systems. (Im thinking he threatens Marv's new gf with telling her about Marv's sordid past) 

Marv regretably does it, Kevin finds out, ruins their new friendship, etc

\----- Act 2

Something goes wrong somewhere, and out of desperation, the rival company or Harry Jr kidnaps Kevin and holds him hostage. Maybe Marv too. (Or Marv comes to reacue Kevin?)

They're trapped in some kind of big warehouse or something, and ""for reasons"" are on their own. Marv and Kevin join forces and create all kinds of booby traps to fuck up Harry Jr and the bad guys. 

They escape, make up, the publicity saves Kevin's company (or something, a-la Tommy Boy), he & son's relationship resolves, Marv gets his girl back. 

\----Act 3/The End

\*Oh yeah; of course the story takes place around Christmas. Kevin doesn't wanna downsize and have fo fire or lay off employees for the holidays. (Makes it sweeter)

As much as I hate to be here, I appreciate that this group is exists, and that it’s given me some good information and clarity.  Here is my story and curious what you all think. 

Married 13 years and together 23 with two young boys. Early in our relationship my wife’s high school boyfriend asked her for coffee and it made me seriously uncomfortable. I told her at the time that if she wanted to maintain a relationship with this former intimate partner that I didn’t want to have a relationship with her.  Years passed. We got married and I thought this dude was in the past and staying there. 

In 2023 she took a new job in his office building. I wasn’t thrilled but didn’t say anything so as to be supportive.  2024 I noticed him walking in our neighborhood almost daily and even past our house one time when it looked like I was not at home(which is fucked up in and of itsel to be circling your high school ex’s home but I didn’t make a commitment with this dude). But then I started noticing my wife was following him around. Driving walking or biking in circles in an attempt to cross paths with him on his walks. Then I started noticing (by location shared) that she would drive circles, sometimes up to 4 times, circling their mutual workplace at times he would start or finish work. I also noticed her driving circles waaaaay out of the way around a school that they both volunteered at after driving past their mutual workplace and presumably not seeing his car there.   The most painful time was after a surgery, she was supposed to get lunch and pain meds for me but she had to drive circles in our neighborhood to try and see him on the way to helping me in my pain. It was just too bizarre and felt like a stalky obsession kind of thing.  This behavior went on for many months. I was struggling with reality and that this was somehow coincidental or not what I was seeing but eventually I had to come to terms that she was intentionally following or seeking him out in the weirdest of ways. This went on for 8 months. 

I confronted her for these actions and she was very contrite in the moment (after initially lying and gaslighting and saying it didn’t happen…until I showed enough evidence that it did happen). A couple days later she brought up the terms limerence and person addiction…two concepts I was not familiar with.  She said that before confronting her that she was looking into getting therapy for this (mind you she never did, just said she was looking into it. Maybe she was. Who knows?) A month after confronting her she wrote me a 6 page love letter extolling me for being a wonderful husband.  But she never truly apologized for her actions and what she had done.   I gave her time and space to get some therapy but over time she shifted the narrative and rewrote the entire history of our life.  She said our entire marriage was horrible and I was controlling and abusive. After a while she shifted the story saying that it was not limerence or person addiction but that she just wanted to “see him”. Currently she says the things she apologized for and sought therapy for never even happened. In October she filed for divorce and has continued this story that I was a horrible and abusive husband.

I’ll be in Seoul during the second week of March and I’m looking for some buddies to grab coffee, go shopping, and geek out over K-beauty with me! ☕️🛍️

Here is my rough itinerary:

• Day 1: Land at 6:00 AM, but can't check into my place in Gangnam until 3:00 PM. I’m planning to kick things off with a professional hair wash, a massage, and some skincare shopping to shake off the jet lag. Does anyone have a ""holy grail"" spot in Gangnam they recommend?

• Day 2: I’m having a minor eye procedure (blepharoplasty/stich).

• Days 4–7: My eyes will still be a bit swollen, so I’m looking for ""low-impact"" sightseeing. I love temples and aesthetic spots like the Starfield Library.

Seeking Recommendations:

Does anyone know of any peaceful temple tours (day trips) or indoor spots that aren't too dusty/windy (to protect my eyes)?

Without getting into specifics, I have an in-house marketing job at a toxic company that I desperately want to quit. I dread going to work every day and it’s damaging my personal life and mental health.

I have been applying to jobs for months and got one interview but was not hired. The organization I interviewed with really liked me and encouraged me to keep applying to their jobs but they haven’t had any openings that I qualify for since. I will continue applying elsewhere but who knows how long it could take to secure a job in my field in this market.

I want to continue my marketing career, but I also have experience working as a barista, and I have the connections to get a well-paying job in coffee for the time being. If I make that pivot, I would be making less money and need to start paying for insurance out of pocket. But I know I would be happier and my mental health would benefit. 

My biggest worry is that, if I quit my current marketing job to work in coffee for a while, I’ll make my odds of getting another marketing job even worse.

Today I am going to stop taking my medication to increase the chances of dying soon (the heart issuse isn't the reason that I can't get a licesne)

22M I posted about that before that I can't get a driving licesne due to a health con and I'm a lesser because of it and I've planned my suicide and I've never been happier. Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

and she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about and we haven't talked or met in 2 days now but she said that you can take all the time you need and stuff like that

And I don’t care anymore about uni because I’ve spent my last days entirely in bed, and I haven’t gone outside the apartment at all. I’m ready to end it all, and please don’t give basic solutions like walkable cities, buses, or similar thing

How would you structure your meals and training for maximum benefit?","Catholic 32M/5’11”/205lbs. Title is it but for context: 

During lent I intend to maintain a Catholic style fast which is one full meal a day plus two small “meals” not equal a full meal. I plan to eat this way every day but Sunday for the entirety of Lent. It will will be my normal plant-based plus fish pescatarian diet. A few days will be complete water fasts with just coffee and electrolytes (i.e. Ash Wednesday, Good Friday).

This is mainly for spiritual and physical/mental discipline but I’ve been bulking since November and am ready for a cut. I’ll also be training for two half marathons (one in April the other May) and will drop down to 2 days of lifting weights (I’ve posted my lifting routine elsewhere). That said, I don’t want to crash diet and want to keep calories to around 1700-1800 per day, tracked with MyFitnessPal. This way, I’ll be nourished for training and will minimize muscle loss, while still being at a calorie deficit. 

Feedback I’ve gotten is to maintain clear feeding/fasting windows (so maybe 18/6 intermittent fasting with the main meal in the middle). This way I’ll get some of the actual benefits of the fast beyond caloric restriction. For my small “meals” I’m planning for one to be a protein shake (Vega Plant Protein plus Marine Collagen Peptides and Creatine) and the other to be yogurt/skyr with nuts and berries.

Most of us scroll through TikToks or Instagram Reels hoping to stumble on some magical life hack to fix it all. The problem is, most of those “hacks” are hyped by influencers with zero credibility, pushing dopamine hits over real change.

So this post is for anyone tired of the noise. These aren’t vibes-based tips. These are simple, science-backed tweaks you can actually use to build a better, saner life. Pulled from research, top behavioral psych books, and expert interviews, these six hacks don’t require superhuman willpower or a 5 a.m. routine. They work because they’re aligned with how the human brain and body actually function.

---

* **Use the 20-second rule to make or break habits**  
  * From Shawn Achor’s *The Happiness Advantage*, this one’s wildly effective. The idea is simple: reduce the friction to start a good habit by 20 seconds, or increase the friction to stop a bad one.  
    * Keep a book on your pillow so it’s easier to read than scroll at night.  
    * Move your social media apps into a folder on the last screen of your phone, or log out after each use.  
  * Achor found just 20 seconds of reduced or added effort was enough to rewire habits in a few weeks. It works because your brain is lazy. Use that to your advantage.

* **Try the “two-minute rule” to destroy procrastination**  
  * Popularized by productivity expert James Clear in *Atomic Habits*, this rule builds momentum.  
    * If a habit takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.  
    * Want to build a writing habit? Start by writing one sentence. Want to work out daily? Just put on your gym shoes.  
  * The goal isn’t perfection. It’s consistency. Research shows “starter steps” reduce task resistance by lowering the psychological activation barrier (BJ Fogg, Stanford Behavioral Design Lab).

* **Go on a 10-minute walk after eating to lower blood sugar spikes**  
  * This tiny habit has big metabolic benefits. A 2022 review published in *Sports Medicine* found that just 10 minutes of walking after meals significantly reduces post-meal glucose levels and insulin response.  
    * It’s especially helpful if you’re sedentary or work at a desk.  
    * Even better: use that time to take calls or listen to a podcast. Stack it with social or learning activities.

* **Use “implementation intentions” to follow through on goals**  
  * It’s not just about setting goals, it’s about planning the exact when and where.  
    * Example: “I will go to the gym at 7 a.m. at the building across from work.”  
  * This strategy was tested by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer. In a study cited by the American Psychological Association, 91% of people who used this method followed through, compared to 35% of those who just set intentions.  
    * Putting your plans in a time and space gives your brain a cue to act.

* **Social connection is the ultimate productivity and wellbeing hack**  
  * One of the most underused but powerful hacks: talk to people who make you feel good.  
  * Harvard’s 85-year-long *Study of Adult Development* found that *relationships* were the single strongest predictor of long-term health, happiness, and even career success.  
    * It wasn’t exercise or money or job titles. It was how connected people felt.  
    * So grab coffee with a friend, join a local sports team, or message someone you’ve been meaning to reconnect with. That’s not a distraction. It’s medicine.

* **Weird but true: watching nature videos lowers anxiety**  
  * A 2020 study published in *Scientific Reports* found that watching short, high-quality nature clips reduced stress and boosted mood—especially during high-pressure or emotionally taxing moments.  
    * Even 5 minutes helped.  
    * It works by triggering the parasympathetic nervous system and shifting your brain out of “fight or flight.”  
    * If you can’t go outside, watch a David Attenborough documentary or follow nature livestreams on YouTube. It sounds too easy, but it’s real, measurable science.

None of these require a 10-step morning routine or quitting your job to live off-grid. But each one helps you work with your biology, not against it. And done consistently, these small moves stack into huge change.

This is my mother's first grandchild. We don't have the best relationship, when I was born having a baby didn't suit her lifestyle, so I was raised by my nan, her mother. I did interact with her throughout my childhood, but as she was an alcoholic, most of my interactions were visiting her at rehab. My nan passed when I was 21, and I flew down for her funeral, she had always asked me to be kind to my mother so I felt a sense of obligation to at least be amicable with her. So from then until now I have tried to do that. FF I'm pregnant, she's excited. I'm still wary of her but I'm trying, my husband thinks she's changed and encourages me to be more understanding. One day she asks to take me to one of my doctors appointments, I agree as my husband is working. The day of, he's able to attend, but I don't cancel, as I knew she'd be disappointed, she heard the heartbeat and she spent the whole time telling stories of when she was pregnant with me. FF to the xmas, we're thinking about putting pieces on layby, Cot, Carseat, Pram. My husband and I aren't ""well off"" but we manage our finances, we buy off marketplace where we can but for the the pieces we want to last, we're prepared to buy new. My mother was over for coffee and asked us if we had looked at these things, we said we were starting to, she said as her gift to us she'd like to get us the pram. We were both surprised and very grateful, reminding her she didn't have to and that we're ok to get it but she insisted. She asked us to go and try some and let her know which one. So we did, We landed on one which isn't cheap, about $1,700.00 We told her we had picked this one, but as it was expensive had no expectations for her to pay and we were okay to cover it. She declined, we insisted we could at least go halves, she declined. All she asked was that we put it on layby so she could pay it off. We were grateful and we agreed. We waited to put it on layby, incase over boxing day it went on sale, it didnt. However she still insisted we go that day. Boxing day comes, she arrives at our house 45mins early (as I'm getting up) I ask her why she's so early, she says ""fine, nevermind"" and leaves! I text her and apologise if I was rude, as I was just surprised. She doesn't respond. On my birthday, a few days later, she gives me a gc to put the pram on layby $500 and tells me to let her know when that's done and she'll make payments. We do this and let her know. 1mth passes into the 3mth layby and she's not made any payments, we let her know we put the carseat on layby as well and are making payments and ask if she needs the details for the pram. She says ""as agreed, I'll pay for half so I'll give you a gc for $400 and you can put it on the layby"" I never expected her to pay for the pram in the first place, and we offered to pay half and now all of a sudden she's changed her mind and is acting like this was the agreement all along",0,1770943265.0,AmItheAsshole,13,0.44,False

Everyone Is Looking At You!,"The spotlight effect: a psychological phenomenon that causes a person to overestimate how much attention surrounding people are giving them. It's a strange feeling and something I've ""suffered"" with all my life, at least as long as I can remember. 

A short walk down the high street. Hundreds of pairs of peepers, all of them looking at me.                                                                                                                                                        I step into a cafe for a coffee. The whole place freezes, silence, heads swivel, eyes glaring at me.                                                                                                                                    It's all in my mind, but for a brief moment it's reality.                                                                          The show has started. I've been shoved out onto the stage and I hate it.  

The irrational unease can often exact an involuntary debilitation, forcing me to behave a certain way, or talk in a particular manner, even causing unintentional outbursts. This, unfortunately, can often result in me talking just for the sake of it, maybe to fill an awkward void or uncomfortable pause in a conversation. More unfortunate is that if I'm a newcomer to the group, these unnecessary ""gap-fillers"" are, more often than not, taken the wrong way. 

It's not unusual for many years to pass before a person truly ""gets"" me. Not wanting to be ""got"" much of the time doesn't help matters. 

So returning home—or to a ""safe place""—is usually at the back of my mind, making a big enough racket so as to be noticed. And when I do, return home that is? The racket quietens and the spotlight dims, allowing me to return to the comfort of my own skin, free to be myself again. 

Whatever the reason—or the professional diagnosis—self-consciousness is the star of the show here.                                                                                                                           Without awareness or consideration of ""self"", no number of spotlights could adequately highlight the stage act I'm forced to perform.                                                                 I've deeper, more spiritual reasoning to this oft-times overwhelming sensation—                               maybe I'll divulge those another time. 

But instead of absorbing the many probing eyes—leaving me feeling exposed, silently screaming for cover—what if I decided to reflect an image outward? Not an ""alternate persona"", much of what the world and its web exhibits, but *His* image.  

*""Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.""* (Matthew 5:16)

What if I consciously stopped thinking inwardly—dwelling on, even exacerbating, the insecurities that were born long ago—and chose to allow Him to shine outwardly, that all may see His light, not my darkness?

Just imagine such a reflection and how it would place the audiences gaze upon Him.                    I could take refuge in His righteous right hand—offering me courage and reassurance in the face of fear—while glorifying Him also. 

Next time, when I'm out and about—doing the shopping, walking onto a packed beach, stepping foot inside a church—I'll pray: 

""Please, Father, hold me in Your hand, comfort me, strengthen me, embolden me. I am the light of the world, let my light so shine before men, that they may see my good works and glorify you in Heaven."" 

Almost all of the time, the only person looking at me, is Him. So it'd be wise to look upon Him. Don't you think?

*""Therefore I will look to the Lord;                                                                                                                              I will wait for the God of my salvation;                                                                                                                 My God will hear me.""*  (Micah 7:7)

Went for a vintage 70s cafe poster aesthetic.

This is one of 5 food culture pieces I launched (also have Tahdig Society for my Persian fam and Mile High Club pastrami lol).

My questions for you:

	∙	Does the look work or does it feel too busy?

	∙	thoughts on color - I added a pic with the image in more colors?

	∙	Any Cuban/Latino folks here - would you actually wear this or nah?

Still super new to this (literally launched last week) so any real talk appreciated. Not trying to get rich, just want to make stuff that connects with people who get the culture.

Keyboards, sourdough, whatever. Lately it’s been fermentation. I have a coworker I’ll call The Sponge who usually just nods along while I talk. Last week I jokingly called him out for not paying attention.

Big mistake.

Monday morning this dude walks up to my desk and starts lecturing ME on histamine levels and the molecular biology of lactobacillus. He’s quoting 9,000-year-old Chinese archaeological sites. He told me my mason jars are trash compared to traditional onggi pots.

I’ve been doing this for months. He apparently learned more in 48 hours than I’ve gathered in a year.

It wasn't even a conversation. It was an academic execution. He didn't just learn the hobby, he speed-ran my entire personality and ""um, actually'd"" me into the dirt.

I haven't talked to him in four days. I’m currently hiding my kimchi jars in the breakroom fridge so he doesn't critique my salt ratio again.

I think I’m done with hobbies. Anyone want some fermentation gear? Barely used, apparently suboptimal.

TL;DR: Told a coworker he didn't care about my hobby. He took it as a challenge, became a PhD expert over the weekend, and murdered my joy before my first cup of coffee",0,1770942676.0,tifu,26,0.43,False

One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

1r3a6kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/depechemode/comments/1r3a6kr/how_it_all_started/,How it all started,"Around May 1979, Vince Clarke started the ""pretty much a guitar band"" No Romance In China and more or less forced his friend Andy Fletcher to join this band, who was just there ""for the social bit of it"".

Vince would quickly ditch No Romance In China, and start a synthesiser band with Robert Marlow called The Plan, self-described as an ""Ultravox rip-off"".

The Plan was a band active from fall 1979 up until early 1980. Robert Marlow is responsible for creating the band, starting out with his longtime friend Vince Clarke, but adding friends Perry Bamonte and Paul Langwith soon after.

Vince Clarke: vocals, guitar, synth

Robert Marlow: vocals, synth, guitar

Perry Bamonte: guitar

Paul Langwith: drums

Pictured here: Vince, Robert, with friends Doug White and Mark McCarthy.

However, Vince wanted to create another synthesiser band, with Andy Fletcher, which he named Composition Of Sound. Vince Clarke sees this moment as the beginning of Depeche Mode: ""And that's really how Depeche Mode started; it was just me and Fletch.""  It did not take long before The Plan disbanded, the reason being Marlow's and Clarke's big egos, which is not only acknowledged by Marlow and Clarke themselves but also by No Romance In China's drummer Pete Hobbs. Hobbs: ""Once Vince got into keyboards and then started off with Martin, there was a bit of jealousy, rivalry between them. Fletch couldn't play, and from my point of view it was really weird because you've got Rob with all this talent, but who Vince didn't want to be in the band, yet Fletch who couldn't even play a guitar was in the band. But Fletch was such a character - I think his character pulled him into that. I think with the way Vince and Martin were, very shy people, you needed that. Fletcher made them laugh. He just bound them together in the sense of personality rather than musical talent. If Rob had been in there, lots of egos flying around... they didn't need that.""

Andy Fletcher knew Martin Gore because they were in the same class together at Nicholas School, and would also hang out often. Martin would also occasionally accompany Andy during Boys' Brigade outings. In late 1979, Martin developed an interest in synthesiser music. His friend (and Vince's The Plan colleague) Robert Marlow asked Martin Gore to be in his new band French Look and lent his synthesiser to Martin for two weeks. After these two weeks, Martin wanted to buy a synthesiser of his own. Vince Clarke was still saving up money to buy his first synthesiser, and liked the idea of creating a new synthesiser band. So once Vince and Andy heard that Martin was planning to buy a Yamaha CS5 synthesiser, the twosome accompanied Martin on the train to a London music store. Vince and Andy then asked Martin to be in their new band as well, to which Martin agreed. Vince: ""That's why we got him in - because he had a synth, not for any other reason; certainly not for his outgoing personality! Fletch knew Martin, obviously, from school, so we started rehearsing together. Martin was the first musician I'd met who had a synth, and it seemed obvious to me that he didn't need any special effects or amplification, because his instrument was really just like a big effects box with a keyboard on it; he didn't need anything else outside it."" Martin needed some time to learn to play this equipment, and confessed around September 1982: ""It was the first time I’d ever seen a synth and I knew nothing about them. I didn’t find out how to change the sound for a month… actually I still don’t know. Every sound I had was either a long one or a short one and I didn’t even realise you could change the waveforms. You know that sound that goes – WAUGH? I was stuck on that for ages. And when we made our first demo all the tracks have the same sounds on it."" Not long afterwards, Vince would buy a Kawai 100F, which he used for both Composition Of Sound as well as The Plan. Andy Fletcher would continue playing bass guitar up until the band starts getting gigs, in June 1980. Then he borrowed a Korg 700, but just after that he bought a Moog Prodigy.

Depeche Mode would rehearse a lot at the Woodlands Youth Club, in spring 1980. Andy: ""The earliest Depeche songs like 'Photographic' were written then."" Judging by scans of early setlist sheets from 1980, songs like 'Big Muff' and 'Tora! Tora! Tora!"" were also some of the first songs written by Composition Of Sound. Composition Of Sound would also play several covers in their performances, such as The Price Of Love, Television Set, Lieutenant Pigeon's Mouldy Old Dough, and Phil Spector's Then She Kissed Me (visit the page Early live-only songs for more information). Vince Clarke would also record a four-track demo tape by himself.

Friends of Composition Of Sound have told author Simon Spence that the band's earliest gigs would take place in each other's living rooms. Martin Gore's school friend (and later on also Vince Clarke's friend) Mark Crick says: ""When Composition Of Sound started, I remember them playing in Martin's front room. There would have been a small crowd watch: me, Fletch's pal Rob Andrews; Martin's sisters, Martin's mum."" Nikki Avery, Deb Danahay's friend: ""I had seen Composition Of Sound play at Martin's house. They'd play in each other's front rooms on a Sunday afternoon or something. It was like that."" Anne Swindell, Martin's first girlfriend: ""I've got some photos of one of the first Composition Of Sound gigs in Fletcher's front room. It was more for rehearsal really - to get a sense of what it would be like to be lined up and feeling like there would be an audience."" Rob Marlow: ""Composition Of Sound were playing gigs in people's front rooms - each other's front rooms, basically. I seem to remember a memorable Composition Of Sound gig where the audience was made up of Martin's sisters' teddy bears. There'd be people like Anne Swindell, Denise Jekyll, Steve Burton, and Rob Andrews there. We would come around and join the teddy bears. Fletch played a bass guitar, Vince played guitar, and Martin played the Yamaha CS5 he'd bought. They were a bit like the early Cure: all the songs were in place, the ones in the early Depeche Mode set."" Subsequently they performed at their regular rehearsal haunt, the Woodlands Youth Club, for a bunch of children. Andy describes it as follows: ""That was our first proper concert. We wasn't getting paid, it was a favour, because at that time we was rehearsing in this youth club, we played just for a favour. The funny thing was that kids had never seen a sythesizer before, and were just fiddling about with our knobs.""

Composition Of Sound were nevertheless feeling as if a frontman was missing. Around April 1980, Composition Of Sound were rehearsing at Woodlands Youth Club again, sans Martin, who was rehearsing in the same building with his other band, French Look. At this fateful rehearsal, French Look's Paul Redmond had brought his friend Dave Gahan with him. Marlow: ""He was our sound engineer. I say sound engineer - he twiddled the knobs, turned the volume up and down."" During an impromptu jam session, Dave took French Look's microphone and sang David Bowie's 'Heroes'. Vince Clarke could hear Dave sing next door and was impressed. Vince called Dave a week later, asked if it was he who had been singing that song, and if he wanted to join his band. Vince describes the audition afterwards: ""Because no one came to our gigs, we decided that because Dave Gahan was very, very popular, we'd get him in the band. He really looked the part, so we decided to audition him to be the vocalist. I remember the interview we did with him, and I remember him singing. We gave him three songs - two that I'd written and one cover of a Bryan Ferry song... a Roxy Music song. He sang both of the original ones badly, I remember, but he sang the Bryan Ferry one quite well, because he was obviously quite familiar with it. So then we decided that he'd be alright for the job."" 

Andy says in 2006: ""Vince was sort of the lead singer before Depeche Mode, but he wasn't really comfortable doing that, so we thought we'd grab Dave. Dave looked better than us, and had about a thousand more contacts: we had no contacts, and he had loads of contacts. And he sang really well as well."" Dave Gahan had never been in a band himself but had been on stage before: ""I rehearsed a couple of times with a few bands. There was one that my friend Tony Burgess played drums in. He didn't actually have a drum kit; he played biscuit tins - never played a gig, just rehearsed after school. They were called The Vermin. They were very famous in that one area of Basildon. In our own minds we were going to be the next Sex Pistols."" However, The Vermin's drummer Tony Burgess denies that Dave actually joined his band. Their singer Rik Wheatley echoes this statement: ""When I left Basildon I heard Dave had joined The Vermin but they didn't do anything. It was one of those things that lasted for ten minutes."" Nevertheless, Dave did like the idea of being on stage: ""I think when you're a kid it's always a dream to be a singer in a band. I used to sing along to all the 'Slade' records in front of my mirror, but I never thought that my dream would come true!"" Dave reflected in 2001: ""It was never ""I want to do what other bands are doing, musically"" when I first went to see a band like The Clash, it was like, ""I can do that"". I've been doing it in front of the mirror with a hairbrush for a long time anyway so I could really do it, I really kind of had dreams of myself doing it and it wasn't long after that that I found myself in that position and it's a lot scarier when you first stand up there in front of the people than what you imagine so it took me a good few years to actually probably move like a step to one side or something during the gigs.""

Composition Of Sound's concerts outside of their living rooms and the rehearsal venues would each be a step forwards towards getting paid gigs: the first gig was at friend's Deb Danahay's party on 1980-05-30; the second gig was supporting The School Bullies at Scamps on 1980-06-05; the third gig was at Martin's and Andy's school on 1980-06-14. After two performances at Top Alex, they would quickly get a residency at Crocs and Bridge House respectively, due to Dave's connections and Vince's perseverance.

Composition Of Sound continued rehearsing as a foursome at the Woodlands Youth Club, the St Paul's Methodist Church, the Trinity Methodist Church, and also at the Congregational Church (now United Reformed Church) in Billericay. If not there, then they could always rehearse at home. Marlow: ""When Composition Of Sound were beginning to rehearse I used to go round to see them at Vince's mum's house. She was at home all the time and Vince used to rehearse the band with their drum machine in the garage. You opened up the garage door and there'd be these four guys standing round with headphones on, clicking away."" Dave said in 1982: ""The way we make music changed a lot from when we started. When we first recorded we’d just go into a room and play along live. Vince would come along with a song and it would go from there. Andy would put on a bass line and then Mart would put on another synth."" Eventually they would make a demo tape in the summer of 1980. Vince and Dave would take one of the very few copies of this tape with them to London, and ask record companies such as Beggars Banquet Records to listen to it. On or shortly before September 1st 1980, they took the tape to Rough Trade Records; while Rough Trade did not like the tape, they forwarded the duo to Mute Records, who had an office within Rough Trade's building. Daniel Miller was not only angry about an album pressing mistake on Fad Gadget's first album, but he also took one quick look at the pair and judged them to be ""fake new Romantics"", exclaimed a sound of disgust, and walked away. However, Daniel would meet them again at 1980-11-12 Bridge House, London, England, UK, and be so impressed that he offers to sign them.

While Composition Of Sound would become so embarrassed of their first band name that they refused to mention it in interviews later on, it is rumoured that some even worse band names were being considered: Airport Coffee or Airport Cafe, Changes (presumably a reference to David Bowie's eponymous song), Peter Bonetti's Boots (a reference to Chelsea's goalkeeper from Andy's favourite football team), The Lemon Peels, The Runny Smiles and The Glow Worms. The name 'Musical Moments' was also suggested by Vince for as both a band name and the name of their first album. Starting at the 1980-09-24 Bridge House gig, they changed the name to Depeche Mode, which was derived from the French fashion magazine 'Dépêche Mode', minus the accent marks. Martin explains: ""Originally we had a very bad name, and we had to get rid of it, and we spent a lot of time thinking about the name but we couldn't come up with anything. And at the time, Dave was at college doing Window Display and Fashion Design, so he used the magazine Depeche Mode quite a lot, the French fashion magazine. So we just stole the name, because we couldn't think of anything better."" Andy clarifies: ""Depeche Mode was the only reasonable one we could find. I tell you, when you form a band it's the hardest thing to find is a decent name. That's why there's so many naff names around. (laughs) Actually people have criticised us on all levels basically but no-one's ever criticised the name so that must be something."" Instead, Depeche Mode would have to keep explaining for a few years afterwards where the name comes from and how it's pronounced.

Depeche Mode agreed with Stevo Pearce to record their first song for his Some Bizarre compilation album in December 1980. Photographic was recorded at Stage One recording studios, owned by John Bassett, located at 14 Sebert Road, Forest Gate, London E7 0NP. The studio was presumably Stevo Pearce's suggestion. Simultaneously, Depeche Mode would start working with Daniel Miller on what would become Speak & Spell.

The success of Composition Of Sound and eventually Depeche Mode is generally credited to Vince Clarke. Martin Gore confesses: ""I didn't take it very seriously. I think that Vince was very, very driven, at a very young age, and I'll give him a lot of credit for that."" Robert Marlow admits: ""Vince spent all of his time getting gigs or trying to get record company interest. In hindsight, Composition Of Sound had a lot more going for them than French Look in that they had Vince actively seeking gigs and really putting his mind to it."" Andy Fletcher echoes this: ""Vince was so driven back then. It was his aim to make money and drive a Rolls-Royce through the centre of Basildon. He used to work in a yoghurt factory and earn £30 a week, of which he’d save £29.50. Without Vince’s drive Depeche Mode wouldn’t have happened.""

Throughout 1980 and 1981, Vince Clarke would manage to pull more and more gigs outside of their home turf (see the page 1980/1981 background info). However, he would tell the band in September 1981 that he no longer wanted to be in the band, and was quickly replaced by Alan Wilder.",6,1770941708.0,depechemode,2,0.88,False

I (27F) moved to Berlin about three years ago and… I still haven’t made a single real friend.

I’m working and studying, so I’m definitely busy. I’ve taken German language courses and now speak it quite well. I go out, I meet people, I talk to colleagues, classmates, acquaintances. But somehow everything stays on this very surface level, as Germans say, connections feel and stay oberflächlich. 

Even when I hang out with someone a few times, it never turns into a genuine connection. It feels like everyone is very focused on their own lives, routines, and existing circles which I understand but it makes it really hard to break in beyond small talk.

I’m not expecting childhood-best-friend-level closeness. I just want someone I can invite over for coffee, go on café dates with, share struggles and little joys, send random voice messages to, and actually feel comfortable around.

I’m married and my husband is my best friend, which I’m very grateful for. But he’s often busy or out with his friends (mostly guys I don’t really vibe with), and I’d love to have my own person or circle too.

I genuinely enjoy my own company. I’m not afraid of being alone but I also miss having a real, warm, female (or male) friendship here in Berlin.

Now when I asked her about it, she said “He was in town, what else was I supposed to do?” Just need to validate if it’s okay to be mad that she doesn’t get the problem.

\- 

I know that my story is much less severe than many cases on this sub, but I don’t know where else to get feedback I need so I hope for understanding.

When I was 10, my mom’s boyfriend started behaving weird: he’d sit next to me and give me long kisses on the neck and ears, and wouldn’t stop until I’d leave. He’d always do that when she was out of the room or if she was looking away. 

I realized after several times that something is not right, told my friend who tought me that this is called a “pedophile” so I went to my mom and told her that this is what her boyfriend is. 

She stopped bringing him home but never commented on the situation or gave me validation. 

They continued dating for a bit and then broke up, without this being tied to what he did. 

Several years later, he was in town and she went for coffee with him, they had a chat, and she casually told me about this. 

After I grew up, I asked her multiple times about what happened when I was a kid and she would usually say she doesn’t remember it, or that she stopped bringing him home so it’s not a big deal. 

Recently I’ve asked her why she would meet with him years later knowing what he did. She said “He was just in town and we had a quick chat, it’s not like it was long. You are weird, what was I supposed to do?”

She seems to still completely not understand why I bring it up or what the problem is.

Honestly, just need to validate feelings, cause it made me doubt myself and think that maybe I overreact. ",1,1770941488.0,adultsurvivors,3,1.0,False

Today I am going to stop taking my medication to increase the chances of dying soon (the heart issuse isn't the reason that I can't get a licesne)

22M I posted about that before that I can't get a driving licesne due to a health con and I'm a lesser because of it and I've planned my suicide and I've never been happier. Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

and she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about and we haven't talked or met in 2 days now but she said that you can take all the time you need and stuff like that

1r3a1on,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3a1on,"His Secret Needed a Kidney, His Punishment Needed an Empire","Taking my five-year-old daughter for her checkup, I spotted something weird on the form—a kidney function test that wasn't supposed to be there.


""It's required for donor matching. You didn't know?""


The nurse's explanation left me completely confused:


""I didn't book that. There's been a mix-up.""


""No mix-up. Mr. Hayes added it himself when he made the appointment.""


Hayes. My husband, Archer Hayes.


That's when I caught sight of another form in her hand:


Diagnosis: Polycystic kidney disease.


Patient: Felicity Hayes.


Guardian signature: Archer Hayes.


My heart snapped.


I forced my hands to stop shaking and managed a smile.


""Oh, I see my husband signed as the guardian. Must be some relative of his. I should probably go check in on her.""


""Could you tell me which room she's in?""


...


The nurse glanced at Poppy's paperwork, then pointed.


""Third floor. Room 312.""


""Thanks.""


I scooped up Poppy and headed straight for the elevator.


The mirrored walls showed my face—tight, bloodless.


Poppy wrapped her arms around my neck, her breath warm against my cheek.


""Mama,"" she whispered, ""is the matching thing… bad?""


My arms tightened around her.


She was too young to understand what donor matching meant, but she could read the tension in my voice.


""Yes.""


My voice came out cold, detached. ""People who love you don't make you do that.""


""Then why does Daddy want me to?""


The elevator dinged. Third floor.


I looked into her clear, trusting eyes and tried to smile, but my face wouldn't cooperate.


""We're about to find out.""


Room 312 was at the end, door half-open.


I was about to push through when a woman stepped out—beige cardigan, no makeup, the whole soft-girlfriend aesthetic Archer always went for.


""Can I help you?"" she asked, her eyes flicking to Poppy before her expression shifted.


""I'm Archer Hayes's wife."" I kept my voice level. ""I'm here to find out how my husband ended up signing paperwork for your kid.""


A nurse wheeled a cart past us. A couple of visitors stood nearby, chatting.


The woman's face flickered for a second.


""Oh—you must be Sloane!""


She rearranged her features into something meek and apologetic.


""Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Ivy Holbrook.""


""Archer's my distant cousin. My daughter and I came up from our hometown for treatment, and we didn't know anyone here. Archer's just been helping out—""


""Is that right?""


I stepped past her into the room.


I wasn't buying the cousin story for a second.


There, a girl lay in the hospital bed—maybe seven or eight, older than Poppy.


She was flipping through a picture book.


Hearing the sound, she looked up.


And my breath stopped.


The round cheeks. The slight upturn of her nose. Those eyes.


She looked exactly like Archer.


""Mommy, who are they?"" the girl asked, her voice small and sweet.


Ivy rushed in after me. ""This is your aunt Sloane and your little cousin Poppy. Say hi, Felicity.""


""Hi, Aunt Sloane,"" Felicity said obediently. Then she looked at Poppy. ""Hi. Poppy.""


Poppy wriggled out of my arms and started looking around the room with open curiosity.


Her gaze landed on the nightstand, and her eyes lit up.


""That necklace looks like mine!""


I followed her stare—and my stomach dropped.


The clasp was custom-made, a special design I'd commissioned because Poppy kept breaking regular ones.


""That's my—"" Poppy started to point.


Ivy was already at the bedside, snatching the necklace off the table.


""Oh, this? Just a cheap knockoff. Kids love shiny things, so I grabbed it at some random store.""


Her smile stayed in place, but her fist was clenched tight around the pendant.


""Really?"" I said softly.


I still remembered the day that necklace disappeared.


Poppy came home from preschool in tears, saying she'd lost it.


We'd torn the house apart looking for it.


Eventually, Archer had hugged her and said, ""Daddy'll get you an even better one.""


I'd been buried in a pitch for a new contract at the time, so I didn't think much of it.


But now that I thought about it—Archer had come home early that day.


So that's probably when he took it.


Poppy looked up at me. ""Mama, that necklace really does look like mine...""


""Yours is at home, sweetheart,"" I said, brushing her hair back. Then I turned to Ivy. ""What's wrong with Felicity?""


""Polycystic kidney disease."" Ivy's voice went quiet. ""The doctors say… she'll need a transplant.""


""I see."" I nodded. ""Well, we'll let you rest. Sorry to intrude.""


As I walked out, I heard Felicity's small voice behind me. ""Mommy, when is Daddy coming…""


The door clicked shut, cutting off the rest.


I held Poppy's hand and walked down that long hallway.


My steps were steady. My hand didn't shake.


But something inside my chest was freezing over, inch by inch, starting from my heart and spreading outward.


Back in the car, I buckled Poppy into her seat and turned on her favorite cartoon.


""Mama's gonna make a quick call, okay? You watch this for a bit.""


""Okay.""


She nodded, already absorbed in the screen.


I walked to a corner of the hospital garden and dialed my assistant.


""Ms. Gardner?""


""Trey,"" I said, my voice eerily calm, ""I need you to pull everything on Archer.""


""Last five years—no, make it seven.""


""Bank statements, travel records, phone logs. Focus on anything tied to Seattle.""


""And I need a full background check on a woman named Ivy Holbrook.""


""I want the report in three days.""


Chapter 2


I took Poppy home.


The motion-sensor light in the entryway glowed softly as we walked in.


On the wall hung our family portrait—taken on Poppy's third birthday.


Archer holding her. Me leaning into his shoulder.


Perfect.


So perfect it made me sick.


""Mama, I'm hungry.""


Poppy tugged at my sleeve.


""Okay, baby. Mama'll make you dinner.""


I crouched down to change my shoes, the motion automatic, rehearsed.


Through the frosted glass of the patio door, I could see the swing set in the yard. Archer had built it himself when Poppy was two.


""I'm gonna build my girl a swing that makes her feel like she's flying,"" he'd said.


He'd worked until midnight, blistering his hands.


I'd scolded him for being ridiculous while I bandaged him up.


He'd just kissed my forehead and said, ""Anything my girls want, I'll make it happen.""


We were so good back then.


We met in college. He was broke. I was the daughter of Seattle's richest man. Everyone said we didn't make sense.


But Archer fought his way up from nothing.


He told me, ""Sloane, I'm gonna prove to your dad that I'm worth you.""


When he proposed, he rented out the entire riverside park.


A thousand drones spelled out ""Sloane, Marry Me"" in the night sky.


He'd only been running his company for three years at that point. That proposal cost him nearly everything he had.


I cried and told him it was too much.


He knelt in front of me, holding out the ring. ""Compared to everything you've done for me? This is nothing.""


I cried and put on that ring.


After we got married, I helped him run the company while managing our home.


I reviewed every contract. I sat through every major client meeting.


The success his company had now? Half of it was his talent. The other half was my work.


I thought that was what love looked like—campus to wedding, nothing to everything, building it all together.


But now?


The pasta boiled over in the pot. I stirred them mechanically.


""Mama, they're gonna burn.""


Poppy's voice snapped me back.


I turned off the heat and dished out two plates, setting them on the table just as I heard the lock turn.


Archer was home.


""Smells amazing,"" he said, grinning.


""Just made pasta.""


I turned back toward the kitchen to grab forks. He followed me in and reached for the plates in my hands. ""Here, I got it.""


The second our fingers touched, I flinched.


""What's wrong?""


He looked at me.


""Nothing. Just hot.""


I forced a smile.


Dinner was quiet except for the clink of forks against plates.


""Oh, by the way,"" I said casually, ""something weird happened at Poppy's checkup today.""


Archer's fork paused mid-air. ""What happened?""


""The nurse said they were gonna do a kidney donor match for Poppy. Said you specifically requested it.""


I looked up at him, my smile sweet. ""I was like, who in our family needs a kidney? So I went to the nurse's station to ask, and guess what I found?""


His throat bobbed. I continued.


""A form. Patient name: Felicity Hayes. Guardian signature: you.""


I kept smiling.


""So I figured maybe it was some relative's kid, and I went to check on her. Met this woman named Ivy. Said she's your distant cousin?""


Archer's face went stiff.


""How do you know about them?"" His voice came out dry.


""I was just worried about you,"" I said, spooning some sauce onto his pasta:


""Your cousin's kid is sick—that's a big deal. Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped pull strings at the hospital.""


His shoulders visibly relaxed. Relief washed over his face.


""I just didn't want to stress you out,"" he said, looking down at his pasta.


""You've got enough on your plate with the company and the house. I figured I'd handle it myself.""


Airtight explanation.


If it weren't for Felicity's face, I might've actually believed him.


""Oh, okay,"" I said lightly, letting it drop.


After dinner, Archer went to shower. The water ran loud.


His phone lit up on the nightstand.


\[Ivy: Your wife came by today. I'm scared.\]


\[Ivy: What if she hurts our daughter?\]


\[Ivy: When are you coming to see Felicity? She keeps asking for her daddy.\]


The water stopped.


I quickly moved away and sat on the bed, scrolling through my own phone like nothing happened.


Archer came out, toweling his hair. He paused when he saw me.


""You're still up?""


""Waiting for you.""


I smiled.


He picked up his phone, glanced at it, and started typing quickly. His face gave nothing away.


Before bed, he kissed my hair.


That gesture used to make my heart race. Now it just made me feel sick.


My phone buzzed under my pillow.


I pulled it out.


A file from Trey.


Chapter 3


I opened it.


The first page was a timeline.


Seven years ago: Archer's first business trip to Seattle.


Six years ago: Ivy's bank account received a transfer from Archer. Memo: Living expenses.


Same year: Felicity was born. Birth certificate listed no father, but the emergency contact was Archer's number.


Four years ago...


Three years ago...


Two years ago...


Multiple trips to Seattle every year.


Every trip matched up with spending records and transfers to Ivy.


Archer and I got married six years ago.


Poppy is five.


Felicity is six.


Turned out while I thought we were building a future together, he'd already started another family.


My phone buzzed again. Another message from Trey:


\[Trey: Ms. Gardner, found something else. The night you had complications during delivery, Mr. Hayes was at Ivy's birthday party.\]


I stared at the words until everything around me went silent.


I remembered every detail of that night.


Sixteen hours of labor. Fetal distress. Emergency C-section.


Before they put me under, the doctor handed me a consent form. My hand shook so badly I could barely sign.


""Where's my husband?"" I forced the words out through clenched teeth.


The nurse looked at me with pity. ""Mr. Hayes had an emergency at work. He'll be here soon.""


As I faded under the anesthesia, barely conscious from the pain, I kept thinking: When he gets here, I'm going to yell at him so bad.


When I woke up, Archer was kneeling by my bed, eyes bloodshot, gripping my hand.


""I'm so sorry, Sloane. I'm the worst. I'm so sorry…""


He slapped himself across the face, hard. The nurses had to pull him away.


I'd felt bad for him. I'd comforted him instead. ""It's okay. Poppy and I are fine, aren't we?""


He'd said, ""I'll never do this again. I swear. I'll never leave you alone like that again.""


Now I knew the truth.


""Mama?""


Poppy's voice drifted from her room, sleepy and small.


I snapped back to reality. My hands were shaking. I almost dropped my phone.


Poppy sat up, rubbing her eyes. ""I had a bad dream…""


""It's okay, sweetheart. Mama's here.""


I slipped my phone into my pocket, got out of bed, and scooped her into my arms, carrying her back to her room.


""Want Mama to tell you a story?""


""Yes, Mama!""


She was warm and soft, smelling faintly of lavender.


This was the child I'd nearly died bringing into the world. The most precious thing in my life.


And her father wanted to use her body to save another child.


Rage coiled around my heart like poison ivy, tightening until I could barely breathe.


When I returned to the master bedroom, Archer was already asleep.


I climbed into bed and stared at his face.


My hand lifted.


Then—


Crack.


The slap echoed through the silent room.


Archer jolted awake, clutching his cheek. ""What the hell?!""


I stared at my hand, then at the red mark blooming across his cheek, and slowly let a smile spread across my face.


""There was a mosquito on your face. Guess I forgot to go easy.""


He blinked at me for a few seconds, his expression shifting from shock to confusion to resignation.


""You've gotten so careless lately.""


He lay back down and pulled me into his arms.


I went stiff as he wrapped himself around me. The smell of him made my stomach turn.


""Go to sleep,"" he mumbled, and within seconds, he was out cold.


I stared at the ceiling until sunrise.


By the time morning light flooded the dining room, Archer was already dressed for the day.


He scrolled through his phone with one hand, sipping coffee with the other, his brow slightly furrowed.


""What's wrong?"" I set down a plate of eggs, keeping my voice casual.


""The hospital called."" He put down his phone, expression serious:


""They said something came up on Poppy's test results. They want us to bring her back in today for a follow-up.""


I knew exactly what was happening, but I made my face go tight with worry. ""What came up? Is it serious?""


""Probably nothing."" He walked over and squeezed my shoulder reassuringly:


""Just routine follow-up stuff. Doesn't your dad need you at the office for that meeting? I'll take Poppy.""


""But—""


""Relax."" He kissed my forehead. ""She's my daughter. You think I wouldn't take care of her?""


The irony of that sentence.


I nodded, swallowing a bitter laugh. ""Okay. Call me if anything comes up.""


When he left with Poppy, she turned and waved at me. ""Bye, Mama!""


""Bye, sweetheart.""


I smiled back.


The second the door clicked shut, the smile vanished.


I grabbed my phone, made a quick call to my dad, then slipped out the door behind them.

At some point it does briefly transition to creamy-sweet on my skin, but then immediately takes a turn into melted plastic, burnt tires territory. This one’s a hard pass (dare I say a scrubber??) I am sad :( Maybe Phlur won’t disappoint me with their new matcha body spray which is in the mail as we speak lol. 

Freedom Musk Latte | 41 - From the jump this is a carbon copy of Replica’s Coffee Break to my nose. I enjoy this one a lot, but I already own Coffee Break and I love it way more so I wouldn’t purchase this one. Very pretty lavender blended with creamy coffee and woods. I actually really like the rose note in this too, which is probably the biggest difference between this one and the Replica. Very nice overall. 

Freedom Musk Santal | 34 - Sneezy pink pepper bleeds straight into orange blossom and then it all sort of fades into a flat, synthetic musk at the end. I’m not really a fan of orange blossom in general so I knew I probably wouldn’t like this. I will say, that the orange blossom isn’t as offensive in this rendition as it usually is to my nose. So if you’re into the soft white floral-musky vibes, maybe give this one a try. Another pass for me. 

Freedom Musk Bouquet | 27 - A very pretty solar white floral at first sniff. I can picture a sophisticated lady wearing this to a coastal wedding in the summer time. The jasmine is very pretty. It eventually made me feel like I was standing in a funeral home though. So it’s another pass for me. 

My clear winner was Freedom Musk Latte! I could do without the others personally. I’m a recent fan of the Kayali brand but kind of expected these to pack a bigger punch if I’m honest. But maybe this was the entire point of a musky line to begin with?

1r39zc0,https://i.redd.it/vr9gkmo7i5jg1.png,"""Coffee vs. Naps"" Analysis a dataset of 500 participants.. amazing results","# A nap is twice as effective as coffee at improving alertness!

The average improvement in alertness after a nap is 19.3, while after coffee it is only 8.9.  

This difference is shocking, especially since the common belief is that coffee is a quick and strong stimulant, but the data shows that a short nap (even just 15 minutes) boosts alertness much more.

# The Side Effect

Coffee Drinkers: 98 reported a ""Crash"" and 75 reported ""Anxiety."" Basically, you choose between panic or passing out.

Nappers: 120 reported ""Grogginess."" You wake up not knowing what year it is, but once that fades, you are a machine.

# Coffee causes collapse even in small doses.

37% of collapses occurred just 15-20 minutes after drinking coffee

This contradicts the idea that collapses only happen after large amounts.

# There is no connection between sleep duration and the effectiveness of napping

Even participants who slept 8 hours the previous night showed significant improvement after napping.

This suggests that napping is beneficial regardless of nighttime sleep quality.

# The Sweet Spot 

The data shows that the optimal nap duration is exactly 15 minutes. Anything longer, and the ""Grogginess"" starts to eat away your gains.

TL;DR: Stop buying latte. Close your eyes for 15 minutes. Unless you enjoy anxiety, then carry on.

1r39xvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_joselleclementine/comments/1r39xvt/struggling_with_cruel_feelings_of_love_that_never/,Struggling with cruel feelings of love that never existed.,"I'm a woman in my 40's whose single and I'd probably descibe myself as demisexual or asexual. i never look at a guy and think wow or get the hots for anyone and that's been long standing. i tend to fall for guys after there's evidence of a mental connection. 

A few months ago I met a guy in his 50's as i needed to instruct him in a professional capacity for something, I'm leaving those details out of this. 

On meeting him for the very first time i felt an immediate connection just saying hello to him. it's hard to describe how it felt, but it was a bit like time standing still for a brief second. We chatted and sorted things needed and i found there was a real feeling of comfort speaking to him. it flowed and felt so easy and good, we even managed to have a giggle at a couple of things we had in common.

We did what we needed then met again a few weeks later. for something else business related. The entire time between seeing him again i was consumed by anticipation. We saw eachother for business a second time but there wasn't a lot of opportunity to speak. He caught up with me at a quiet point and recommended i visit a place he liked. I wasn't sure he was asking me there so i agreed and did so a few days later, hoping he'd be there but wasn't. 

i emailed him to tell him I'd been and added that i hoped he'd of been there because I'd of liked to of seen him again. I ended by asking him to go for coffee to which he agreed and we met a few days later. Our coffee was great but no plans to meet again were suggested. i followed up with an email telling him I'd liked it and he replied saying similar. 

A month later i saw him again and he mailed me afterwards saying it was great to see me. I bit the bullet when i replied and asked him out on a date. this took me immense guts. it's something  i haven't done before, and seeing as i fancied him times 100 by this point I felt ultra kudos to myself!

What came next blindsided me. He replied telling me he was gay. At no point did i have the slightest hint he was. Nothing about him gave me any inducation he wasn't into females. I felt immediately the jigsaw was slotting together as to why progress seemed slow with him. I wasn't prepared for how i feel now though, a month on. I saw him again earlier this week and the time standing still feeling happened again when we looked at each other. Lockiing eyes, genuine feeling of warmth for eachother all over again.

I'm switched on enough to not conjure up this nonsense but really, how is this even happening. What the actual fuck is going on???? i literally feel broken by this  He's suggested another coffee but honestly, I just feel like I'll end up being his worst nightmare. If he's gay there's no hope, right. So why bother. I'd love to have him as my frirnd, but the pain of falling for a man, actually strongly feeling he is THE ONE! Then being told he's gay and I therefore i must of been tricking myself, living in some stupid fucking loser fantasy is currently hurting quite significantly.

I'm 22. I was trying to rent an apartment last month when the landlord told me my application was denied because my credit score was 470. I didn't even know what that meant. I'd never had a credit card. Never missed a bill payment on my student account. The landlord showed me the report on his screen and I saw it. A Visa card opened in my name in 2016 with a $40,000 limit. Current balance: $38,347.

I threw up in his office trash can.

I drove straight to my parents' house. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold my phone. I had the credit report pulled up when I walked in. My mom was in the kitchen and she saw my face and just froze.

""What did you do?"" I said.

She didn't even ask what I meant. She just put down her coffee and said, ""Your father handled that.""

My dad came in from the garage. I shoved my phone at him and watched his face. He didn't look surprised. He didn't look guilty. He looked annoyed.

""You went through my credit?""

""You destroyed my credit,"" I said. ""There's $38,000 on a card I never opened.""

He shrugged. Actually shrugged. ""We needed it for the house renovation. You were living here, you benefited from it.""

""I was sixteen.""

""And we raised you,"" he said. ""Fed you, clothed you, kept a roof over your head for eighteen years. Consider it rent.""

My mom nodded like that made perfect sense. ""We weren't going to qualify for another card, sweetheart. We knew you'd understand eventually.""

I asked how they'd even done it. Turns out they'd kept my social security card and birth certificate in their safe. Forged my signature on the application. Made minimum payments for a while but then stopped two years ago when my dad's truck broke down and they ""had more important things to handle.""

I told them they had one week to pay it off or I was going to the police.

My dad laughed. Actually laughed in my face. ""You're not going to do that. We're your parents.""

I filed the report three days later.

The detective was younger than I expected. She took my statement, looked at the documents, and said, ""This is pretty clear-cut fraud. They used your identity as a minor. We'll move forward.""

My parents were contacted by the police a week after that. That's when my phone exploded. My mom called me crying, saying I was sending my father to jail. My aunt called and screamed that I was an ungrateful bitch who was tearing the family apart over money. My uncle said I should be ashamed, that parents make sacrifices and this is how I repay them.

My dad sent one text: ""You're dead to us.""

I didn't respond to any of them.

The credit card company investigated and cleared the debt from my record once they saw the police report. My dad was charged with identity theft and fraud. He took a plea deal, got two years probation, and had to pay restitution. My mom wasn't charged because she claimed she didn't sign anything, just ""knew about it.""

They never apologized. Not once.

I haven't spoken to them in four months. I moved two states away and got the apartment I wanted. My credit score is slowly climbing back up. Some of my family still won't talk to me. My grandmother sends me Facebook messages every few weeks asking when I'm going to ""fix this"" and forgive them because ""they're getting older.""

But here's the thing. I don't miss them. I don't miss the guilt trips or the way my mom always made me feel like I owed them something for existing. I don't miss my dad's attitude that everything he did was justified because he was the parent.

I keep waiting to feel bad about it and I just don't.

Some of my friends think I went too far. That I should have handled it privately, worked out a payment plan, given them a chance to fix it before involving the law. One of my cousins said I ""nuked the family"" over something that could have been resolved with communication.

But they stole from me. They tanked my future before I even had a chance to start it. And when I confronted them, they told me I owed them.

Am I a jerk for refusing to feel guilty about what happened to them?

The Allure of Log Cabins\
Log cabins embody a rustic charm that few other types of homes can match. They are not just places to live; they are a lifestyle choice.

What to Consider When Buying a Log Cabin\
1. Location, Location, Location\

A location near amenities like grocery stores, restaurants, and healthcare is essential if you plan to reside there year-round.\
2. Structural Integrity\
Log cabins are unique due to their construction materials. Be sure to conduct a thorough inspection of the structure. Look for signs of wear, pests, and water damage. Engaging professionals familiar with log cabin construction to assess its longevity and maintenance needs can save you from future headaches.\

It’s essential to understand what maintenance will be required to keep your cabin in good condition over the years.\
4. Resale Value\
While a log cabin may seem like a blissful retreat, it's also an investment. Research the local market trends and assess potential resale value. Unique homes can sometimes take longer to sell, so consider how this aligns with your long-term plans.\
5. Financing Options\
If you’re considering financing your log cabin purchase, be aware that some lenders have special requirements for log homes. Research different loans available for rural properties and check what percentage of the total you’ll be required to put down.\

I \[29M\] met a woman \[30F\] on a dating app in December while I was away on vacation, met up when I got back early January. We went out 4 times, mostly coffee and walking, one time we went to an art show, stuff like that. We also texted daily and had really long, good conversations. Really seemed to live on the same wavelength, she was (and is) great. Unlike most people she actually seemed genuinely interested in me -- she would text me frequently to ask questions about my life, etc. And she would ask me to plan fun stuff for us to do so she obviously wanted to keep seeing me. But at the same time she emphasized she likes to become friends before she feels attraction, and on our last date I screwed it up a little bit by bringing her cookies and going in for a hug. I think I escalated too quickly for her, and a day later she sent me the HR-style text rejecting me, saying she loves hanging out but doesn't feel we're going at the same speed, etc.

I left the conversation like that for a week, and then caved by texting her to say we could still be friends if she wants. She replied ""who said we weren't friends? 🤔"" and so I decided to just keep it light and keep on texting her, because I genuinely did enjoy talking to her about life. She's very smart and intellectual and was just a good person to talk to.

Anyway, after another 2 days or so of keeping up the regular talking (maybe 2-3 texts a day sharing random stuff on my mind, not a ton), she sends me another HR-style formal message essentially saying ""Hey X, I appreciate you sharing what's on your mind with me but I'm really busy with work and don't need these updates right now."" That was really weird to me after she had *just* said we could continue being friends, presumably meaning I could go back to texting her like I did before. She was always so talkative and engaged before, and now suddenly telling me to stop bothering her? So I was angry and removed her as a follower on Instagram, and unfollowed her myself.

She continues to look at all my IG stories though, meaning she must be manually going to my profile? My story would not show up in her story queue since I removed her as a follower.

She also DMed me saying ""What happened? It looks like we're not following each other anymore."" So I caved and followed her back, just basically said I had been annoyed by her telling me to leave her alone. She responded ""😌"" but then didn't reciprocate and follow me back... Continuing to look through all my stories though. I know this is juvenile to think about at almost 30 but I can't help but wonder.

What is wrong with these type of people? What do you want from me? Is she just egotistical and likes that I'm following her but she didn't have to reciprocate in return? After all that kindness she just wants me to be an orbiter? It's sad, I really got along so well with this woman and she turned on me so fast.",1,1770940799.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

I just switched to a breville barista express, it has both pressurized and non pressurized baskets. I have used pre ground beans to make a few coffees with this machine using the pressurized basket.

I am trying to figure out how to even use the non pressurized baskets and can’t even seem to get anything to come out. The internal burr on the express machine is at a 6, I haven’t touched it from who I bought it from. The side dial I tried it at a 5, the beans came out so fine almost like icing sugar. Went up to 7, 9, 10, 11 for the settings and still can’t seem to have anything brew from the machine. I have measured 18g for the double shot basket each time so I’m getting frustrated as I’ve wasted beans at this point. I’ll click a double shot and the pressure gauge shoots up to the max setting and almost nothing comes out.

I’ve read countless forums of people stating each bean may need a different grind setting, depends on roast. I’m using Lavazza crema aroma.

I need some help on how to figure this out. The separate bean grinder I have works if I use that, grind up a coarser bean and just use the dual wall basket but I’m wanting to just use the grinder on the espresso machine itself. I attached a video of when I tried doing a single shot amount. I clicked single and the gauge stayed in the “pre-infusion” area and clicked off.

I clicked the double shot button and it shot almost to the max pressure range, then slowly trickled out what’s in the video.

I just got back to my hometown today after 3 years in Ukraine. I thought coming home would be a relief, but honestly, I feel like I’m losing my mind.

I tried to go for a walk this morning, just a simple walk outside. But I physically couldn't step out the door without putting on my plate carrier under my hoodie. I’m walking around a safe European city carrying three knives and pepper spray. I know logically how insane that looks, but my body wouldn't let me leave without them. I felt naked otherwise.

The first hour was okay, but I couldn't stop scanning everyone. Watching hands, checking pockets, assessing threats. I’ve never been like this before. It was exhausting.

Then I went to get a coffee. The barista turned on the grinder, and the sound… it sounded exactly like a drone. That specific whine. I froze. I didn't scream or dive for cover, but I just started crying. Silent tears, streaming down my face in the middle of a quiet coffee shop. I couldn't stop it. It felt like I was back in the trench instantly.

Is this normal ""decompression"" sickness? Is it full-blown PTSD? Or is this just who I am now? I feel like an alien here or do i need just time to go back to ""normal"" ??

Thanks,

1r39rhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1r39rhe/how_marriage_destroyed_my_life/,How marriage destroyed my life,"For two years, we got to know each other at a distance.

I decided to leave my life in another country and move to build a life with her. I leave everything.

Then We got married.

Over time, she became a completely different woman: zero affection, zero interest in spending quality time together. I grew desperate and begged her to change, to try to make things better. That went on for four years of marriage, until one day something inside me clicked.

One day I came home and discovered that she had pawned our wedding rings.

That was the final sign I needed to leave.

Once I left the house, she started looking for me. For a couple of weeks, the proud woman I never imagined would lower herself to beg me to come back did exactly that. She became loving, attentive, and receptive. But inside me, everything had already changed. I had gone through a silent mourning, a private grief that no longer allowed going back to be an option.

I didn’t meet anyone. I wasn’t interested in anyone. I was just afraid—afraid of being alone in a country where I wasn’t born, starting my life from scratch.

When she realized I wasn’t coming back and that the divorce was serious, she filed a domestic violence complaint against me with an absurd list of accusations, solely to prevent me from returning home to get my clothes and personal belongings. During the last six months of the year, she dedicated herself to posting content on social media accusing me of infidelity, violence, machismo, and narcissism. Every week there was a new accusation. She worked as a police officer and I was receiving constant physical threats from her former colleagues and from her family.

We lived in a small town. The people who knew me also knew her, and of course they believed her version of events. I never told my side of the story. No one ever asked me what had really happened. I never posted anything against her.

I was left without friends, nearly lost my job, and fell into a deep depression and anxiety that led me to attempt to take my own life twice. I felt like I had lost everything, and at times I doubted myself so much that I even started to believe she might be right about many things.

I closed all my social media accounts, threw my phone in the trash, and decided to start a solitary life—without drama, a simple life. I sought psychological help and have managed to handle some emotions, especially guilt. But more than six months have passed, and the pain still feels as strong and as real as if everything had happened yesterday.

My last mistake was inviting a girl out for coffee, thinking I could distract myself a bit. After a date in a public place and a couple of kisses, I ran home feeling like complete garbage. The next day I decided to be honest with her and told her I wasn’t ready to date anyone yet. That woman then decided to contact my ex-wife, meet with her, take a selfie together, and post it saying she was “another woman deceived by this sick and unfaithful man.”

I feel like my life collapses a little more every day. I don’t know how to feel better when I have been blamed for so many things that sometimes I think the greatest reward for her would be my death certificate.

22 did the polite rejection thing. ""we appreciated your interest"" sure you did



8 of them said i don't have enough experience. FOR AN INTERNSHIP. make it make sense??



like genuinely how does this work. you need experience to get an internship that gives you experience. it's literally a paradox



my friend's dad got him into some law firm internship and he deadass told me he just makes coffee and photocopies stuff. but hey at least his resume looks good now i guess



meanwhile i'm over here actually knowing how to code and edit videos and all that but it ""doesn't count""



anyway i was complaining about this to my other friend and he was like ""why don't you just fix it then"" and i was like. you know what. yeah



so i've been working on this thing called FirstOp



it's pretty simple honestly. students sign up, i connect them with startups that actually need help with real projects. not busywork, like actual stuff - market research, content creation, data analysis, whatever



projects are like 1-4 weeks, remote, you do it whenever you have time. then you get proof you did it and can use them as a reference



i figure if you do this 5 times you have way more on your resume than one summer of making coffee



i'm trying to test it with like 50 ontario students this month. got a few startups lined up already, just need people who actually want to try it



link's in the comments if anyone's interested

Before you say anything, the Index members do just literally dress up like that. Under their cloaks are dapper fitting suits.

If you think about it, why would they make a replica furioso when we are guaranteed a real furioso in the future?

Why box themselves into trying to recreate a roland larper when they can make a Rien that isn't larping and is moving like King Von?

See? I see the vision. The vision is that it's Rien not bound under larp.

Rien Unleashed. True Rien.

He will be the Rien that Rien was. The Star of the City that got an Udjat shaking on their boots.

Same weapon shifting, same caduceus, different style.

I have come to this conclusion by analyzing the little bit of dialogue we get of him from Dora and Renclair. Was this caused by 4 cups of coffee and finishing a chunk of thesis in one day?

No. Why would I be thinking about Riensang when I have a paper to pass lmao.

Fuck. Read the captions for my great findings.

[This explains nothing, but it does. He in unexplainable. Not shifting, not weird like donning a self that he isn't but simply hard to fathom.](https://preview.redd.it/ye20hijzd5jg1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd083fcd2db8b4bd7630dc51971e430d0e04b2a)

[Another Gazelle Hook, if he was larping Roland, then The Black Silence would take flesh in front of Dora, but he explicitly stated here that none of them take flesh in those she's met. Months imply that this is post library.](https://preview.redd.it/oj07iojzd5jg1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=f381b36177f8834860a23f8c1a5ad5598b180e32)

Think about it, they could make an entire different Rien that is satisfying but still Rien without disappointing us with no Furioso-Replica.

He just has to NOT larp. The reason why Riensang is going to have burn in his kit is because he's not larping, he can go all out. Moving so fast he ignites you on fire.

Ohohoho.

But basically the crux is that he calls himself Yi Sang. Really just that is the foundation of this last minute prediction.

The reason Rien was asked to throw his name and pick another is to match with who he's larping in a contrasting way.

Rien is french for nothing after all.

Yi Sang just means Plum Wood Box. But can be used as a pun for, you know, Ideal.

He calls himself Ideal. The pun is that he's the IDEAL.

Roland is not the ideal.

The Ideal is always himself in a way that is HIM. Not a larp. Not an imitation.

But Yi Sang with his wings out in one way or another.

Tethering his wings to the Prescript might not be positive, but just like how Ring Sang flutters his wings through sadistic and violent art, Riensang flutters his wings in accordance with the beeps of the Prescript.

To be yourself no matter what.

The Prescript will not disrespect such thing.

It's  a 24 coffee house, but it does serve food. Some just call it ""The Cafe."" The owner calls it a coffee house. Whatever it is, it's a business that sits at the crossroads of time and space. A dimension that connects to all dimensions. 

It looks so thin on the outside. Like a hole in the wall, yet when you enter it's more spacious than one might expect.

You get a feeling of calm when you enter. The lights are a little dimly lit. The air inside is cool but comfortable. The decor is dated, but fine for a place like this. Unusual ambient elevator music plays softly in the background. While the sounds of the kitchen and the voices of patrons fill the air.

All are welcome to visit and enjoy the endless cups coffee.

The owner is an ancient, quiet but grumpy old man who works in the back office. 

A goofy and lighthearted goblin with ADHD runs the register. 

The two waitstaff are very well programmed female androids who can speak all languages. They're quick on thier feet too.

The cook is an usually large sentient octopus who complains all the time. She can cook any food you like or can only eat.

The maintenance staff is just one very tired poltergeist. Who would like you to know about it's  favorite sports team.

Lastly, a beautiful yet strange cat sleeps in the far booth. It rarely acknowledges anyone. It's half white and half black fur runs down its face. It's shimmering jewel like multicolored eyes.

SALES - hiring someone to manage and grow our wholesale clients could be amazing for growth. However, hiring a dud here could tank the business 

ROASTER - it'd be great to have someone else who understands and can roast coffee. If we hired a roaster we could actually leave town for longer than a weekend sometimes.

Social Media and/or graphic design - we probably wouldn't make this a first hire, but someone who's great at this could actually be great for the business.

General Labor - someone to pack bags, sell to walk ins, make deliveries.

Since starting liraglutide 3 weeks ago, I completely lost my thirst. I used to drink a lot of diet soda because I have an issue with drinking water. I never succeeded in making myself drink water, so I allowed myself the diet soda because it’s better than nothing. But now the diet soda tastes wrong. It just doesn’t appeal to me anymore. I still don’t like water, it takes a lot of effort to drink it. I also have adhd so without the internal sign of thirst, I forget to drink. I don’t drink coffee, tea is alright but I always forget to drink it before it gets cold so that’s annoying. 

Please don’t judge, I know it’s bad and I should drink water. I assume it’s a neurodiversity thing and I need to figure out a way to trick my brain. 

I did notice it helps when the water is really cold. Do you have any other ideas I could try? What tastes good to you on the meds? How do you remind yourself to drink? ",7,1770939153.0,antidietglp1,24,0.9,False

Hello everyone. I’m 21 years old and I really need help. Just tell me what the advice is — when will this stop? Will I die? What else can I check that could be affected by snus? 
I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for over a year now. I also want to mention that for a few years I used snus/nicotine pouches, mostly socially — not heavily every single day, but regularly in company. When I was buying them myself, I used Velo 14 mg. Sometimes I would take 4 per day, sometimes 6, and at times even 9 in a day. I also experimented with very strong snus in the past and vomited multiple times from it.
I quit 62 days ago and haven’t used any nicotine pouches since. However, my anxiety is still very strong, which makes me scared that maybe I damaged something in my nervous system or hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, etc.). Snus is not very well researched long-term, and that uncertainty is making me even more afraid.
I also drank alcohol socially over the past few years — sometimes more than I probably should have, but I believed it was within what people consider “normal.”
For over a year now, I’ve been experiencing intense anxiety and panic attacks. During those episodes, I am completely convinced something terrible is happening — that I’m having a stroke, a heart attack, liver failure, or something life-threatening. The fear feeds itself in a vicious cycle. When I calm down, I realize it was anxiety, but in the moment it feels absolutely real.
My first panic attack happened at the end of November last year. I was out with a friend when suddenly I felt overwhelming panic, fear, and loss of control. We went to the ER. They did an ECG, checked my blood pressure and blood tests — everything was normal. The doctor said I was clearly very anxious and offered medication, but I’ve never liked taking medications.
At home, the panic became worse. I had disorganized speech, irrational fears, kept asking my parents if I was going to die, if it was my heart or brain.
Since then I’ve had many medical tests:
Multiple blood tests — normal
Blood pressure: 117/69
Blood sugar: 4.7 mmol/L
Urine tests — normal
Heart ultrasound — normal
Abdominal ultrasound — normal
Chest scans — normal
For 7–8 months I had constant anxiety, especially after alcohol or going out. I began connecting every small physical sensation to serious illness:
Calf pain → I think blood clot
Lung discomfort → chest scan (normal)
Chest twitching → scan (normal)
Upper right abdominal sensation → I think my liver is failing (this is what scares me lately)
I’ve had periods of extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Whenever I hear that someone has died, my anxiety spikes immediately. Even coffee or certain foods make me think they are harming my body.
Recently I’ve also been obsessing about my gums. They look red on the upper side. I went to four dentists — all said morphology looks normal and nothing alarming. One suggested sending images to a university clinic just to double-check. But I keep worrying because it looks red to me.
The anxiety comes in waves. Sometimes I feel like my nervous system is damaged. I worry my cortisol or adrenaline system is broken. I’m scared that nicotine pouches or alcohol caused long-term damage.
So now I’m wondering what else this could be:
Could this be generalized anxiety disorder?
Panic disorder?
Health anxiety (hypochondria)?
Psychosomatic symptoms?
Hormonal imbalance?
Nervous system overstimulation from chronic stress?
Withdrawal effects from nicotine?
Or some kind of underlying trauma I’m not aware of?
My questions:
Has anyone experienced something similar?
Can anxiety like this cause long-term damage to the body or brain?
Can nicotine pouches permanently damage the nervous system or hormones?
How do you break this vicious cycle of fear and physical symptoms?
What are your experiences with psychotherapy?
I feel desperate sometimes. All my medical tests are normal, but the physical sensations feel extremely real. I just want this to stop.
If anyone has advice or experience, please help.",2,1770938941.0,QuittingZyn,3,1.0,False

Most the time he is fast asleep on the couch when I get up for work so I just pick him up and put him outside when I leave . If I am in the house for the day and he comes in I just let him curl up on the couch as that seems to be all he does . 

I have told the neighbour that he often comes in for a nap and was told he is a very friendly cat and have been asked to just pick him up and put him outside which is what I have been doing. .

Part of my morning routine now is getting up, having coffee with the cat, getting dressed washed, shaved and fed and then picking the cat up to put outside as I leave for work at 0600. 

I live in a bungalow so it's easy for him to get in I don't mind that the cat comes in I just fear about accidently locking him in. He is obviously getting in through the bedroom window at night when I'm asleep, I can't shut the window because of I did I would wake up with a headache and feel really foggy and the time I have to get up in the morning you really don't want to have a headache or feeling foggy. 

I now have to fully check the house incase he is anywhere else but most the time he is on the couch with the odd chance of him fast asleep on the kitchen door mat. 

Weekends I am almost always away and have to do a huge check of the house just in case. 

Not sure if there is anything I can do or if I just keep this to my routine because I really don't mind just a little worried about locking him in",5,1770938848.0,Pets,7,0.86,False

I was on my way to work when I decided to stop at Dutch Bros. I wasn't sure what I was gonna but I knew I wanted something different than my usual: Shipwreck (Irie.) When I got there there was one customer ahead me. When it was my turn I was greeted by the face of exuberance. Eyes dazzling with happiness and joy.... a smile that could only be described as wholesome...and a giggle peppered appropriately throughout the conversation. A real zest for life. Thee ""Main Character."" They were so kind, knowledgeable and all the things...thee best broista who ever waited on me...especially at that location. I got their name, which was unique & beautiful, (secretly on my baby name list) hyped them up & told them I was emailing corporate to sing their praises. If this broista was joyful before this made them euphoric. What a precious little sweet soul. The email was already drafted and finalized in my head. My drink was pretty good however even it ir wasn't I still would've been happy due to that broistas service. Fast forward to the end of that day, I not only sent the email but also wrote the broista a handwritten thank you note.

The following day I was running hella late due to my ride canceling last minute... I had less than an hour to walk across town. I immediately got distracted by something by the library. It was a person with a pack of Huskies. Yes, a pack. I had seen them & their pack ONCE right before that flop ""Texas Freeze.""

We chatted for a bit.

One of the pups got loose. Ajax I believe. I asked if i could put him but before the owner could respond Ajax flopped over.

His owner: ""oh he wants belly rubs from you.""

I happily obliged. I continued on....racing. For some reason, I made the executive decision to stop at Dutch Bros. I asked about that specific broista. They told me she was off. When I was walking away I hear someone say ""sir"" or ""Oscar."" I'm not sure which....

That broista wasn't there but this one who waited on me also was amazing .... They are two diamonds at the location. And this time I felt I was rushing and this broista never lost their COLGATE model smile.

(I guess people were ""eavesdropping"" lol...or maybe I was loud cuz .... )

I turn around in case I dropped my wallet again which had happened previously at HEB. I turn to see this young gentleman, who was about 21-25. He disclosed he's an area director of stores. He asked me about the email which he saw. I explained I like to highlight and amplify LEGENDARY service. I've been doing it all year at restaurants, coffee shops and local businesses. Anywhere I can...We chat for a minute which was nice, he was really attentive and frankly gorgeous. After a bit he says he's gonna let me go then tries to shake my hand, which had my drink and server apron, so instead settles for a fist bump.

Before I go he tells me to stop by for gift cards for the email. I didn't even do it for anything! I had pure intentions & a clear heart. He insisted. He also guaranteed the broista was going to get recognized significantly. It was a very gratifying feeling knowing my emails were READ & FINALLY helping the subject they were written about!!! I've done about 10 this year at various places! 

""Good"" and ""great"" guest service representatives often get overlooked imo and people too readily send ""negative"" emails.

I also wrote the broista a handwritten thank you note for their service cuz the world needs more handwritten thank you notes ...",1,1770938842.0,dutchbros,0,0.99,False
