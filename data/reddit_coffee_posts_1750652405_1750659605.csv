1li97zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1li97zy/my_three_elite_brothers_shattered_after_my_death/,"My Three Elite Brothers Shattered After My Death Novel I slammed my fists against the heavy door, my strength already fading.","My stepsister set me up. She faked an allergic reaction, and my three brothers—my own flesh and blood—locked me in the pitch-black cellar, sealing the door with chains as if I were some dangerous criminal.

I slammed my fists against the heavy door, my strength already fading. ""Please! Let me out! I didn't do anything!""

Alexander, my eldest brother—the ruthless business tycoon—stood just beyond the door, his voice sharp as ice.

""Save the dramatics, Evelyn. It's bad enough you torment Sophia constantly, but deliberately feeding her seafood when you knew she was allergic? What kind of monster does that? Stay there and reflect on your actions.""

Nathaniel, the rising music sensation with that ever-present smirk, scoffed. ""Still playing innocent? Pathetic. No one's buying it.""

Benjamin, the so-called artistic prodigy, sneered. ""Vile as always. Maybe a few days in the dark will finally knock some sense into you.""

They didn’t wait for my response. Instead, they carried Sophia—pale, trembling, the perfect picture of fragility—to the car and sped off to the hospital.

Three days passed before they returned.

I was still there—or at least, what was left of me. A ghost, watching silently as they walked back into the house, Sophia cradled between them like a delicate porcelain doll.

Alexander smiled down at her, his voice softer than I’d ever heard it. ""You're so strong, Sophia. I'm just glad we got you to the hospital in time.""

Nathaniel nodded, his usual arrogance replaced with rare tenderness. ""You're recovering so fast. It's a relief.""

Benjamin, ever the devoted one, handed her a tray of food. ""The doctor said you need to eat well. This will help you regain your strength.""

Meanwhile, a maid hovered nervously at the edge of the room, twisting her apron in her hands. Finally, she spoke up.

""Um… Young Masters, Miss Evelyn hasn’t… made a sound from the cellar in three days.""

Alexander barely spared her a glance. ""And?"" He waved a dismissive hand. ""Today is a happy day. Sophia’s home. Don’t ruin it by bringing up Evelyn.""

The maid hesitated but didn’t push further. Nathaniel shot her a sharp glare. ""Don’t waste our time. Evelyn’s probably just throwing another tantrum.""

Benjamin scoffed. ""She’s just mad she got caught. Serves her right.""

Nathaniel smirked. ""Seriously, who plans an entire seafood feast knowing someone’s allergic? That’s pure evil.""

""And here I thought she was finally trying to make peace with Sophia,"" Benjamin added with a bitter laugh. ""Guess I gave her too much credit.""

Sophia, ever the saint, clutched Alexander’s sleeve with trembling fingers, her voice soft and hesitant.

""Evelyn’s been locked up for so long… because of me. What if she’s angry when she gets out?""

Alexander immediately turned to her, his expression hardening. ""Don’t worry about her, Sophia. Evelyn’s gotten away with too much for too long. She needed this. Maybe now she’ll learn to treat you with respect.""

As he spoke, he pulled out his phone, scrolling through our last messages. His jaw tightened. ""Not one call. Not one text. She hasn’t even asked about you.""

Sophia sniffled, tears glistening in her wide, innocent eyes. ""I never wanted to cause trouble. I just wanted to spend time with her. I didn’t mean to take anything from her…""

Alexander sighed, stroking her hair like a doting father. ""You’re too good for her, Sophia. She doesn’t deserve your kindness.""

Nathaniel sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. ""She’s the type who’d betray her own family just for attention. Disgusting.""

Benjamin crossed his arms, his expression dark. ""If she doesn’t come crawling out begging for forgiveness, I’ll throw her out myself.""

I stood there, unseen, unheard, listening with a bitter smile.

My brothers had no idea.

Evelyn wasn’t sulking in that cellar.

She was already gone.

Chapter 2Ever since our parents died, my three older brothers had made me their entire universe. I was their everything.

One afternoon, I casually mentioned wanting a friend my own age. By sunset the next day, they had gone to an orphanage and returned with Sophia, introducing her as my stepsister.

At first, I welcomed Sophia with open arms, thrilled to finally have someone to share my life with. But that joy twisted into something darker. In front of my brothers, she played the perfect, innocent angel—while behind their backs, she spun lies, framing me for things I never did. Slowly, their love for me turned to suspicion, then to cold disdain.

And now, here I was—locked inside a cramped, airless cellar, accused of triggering Sophia’s allergic reaction.

I slammed my fists against the heavy door until my knuckles throbbed, screaming until my voice cracked. ""Let me out! I didn’t do anything!""

But the only replies were their icy, merciless voices from the other side.

""Enough, Evelyn,"" Alexander, the eldest, snapped. ""You’ve caused enough damage. Do you even realize what could’ve happened to Sophia? You could’ve killed her!""

Nathaniel’s voice, usually so composed, was sharp with fury. ""We’ve been too lenient with you. That’s why you think you can keep pulling these stunts. Maybe a few days in there will finally teach you some discipline.""

Benjamin’s words cut like a knife. ""You always play the victim, Evelyn. But this time, you’ve crossed a line.""

The metallic clink of chains echoed as Nathaniel secured the door, followed by the scrape of heavy furniture being shoved against it. My stomach dropped.

The air in the cellar grew thinner with every passing minute. My vision blurred, and I collapsed onto the cold floor, gasping for breath.

Then—darkness swallowed me whole.

When I opened my eyes again, I wasn’t inside my body anymore. I was… floating. Watching.

I found myself in the living room of our mansion. My brothers were gathered around Sophia, doting on her as if she were made of glass.

Alexander sat beside her, his voice dripping with affection. ""You’re incredible, Sophia. You’ve recovered so quickly.""

Nathaniel nodded, his worry etched across his face. ""You had us terrified. It’s a relief to see you looking better.""

Benjamin handed her a steaming cup of tea, his tone gentle. ""The doctor said rest and proper nutrition are key. You need to regain your strength.""

Sophia, ever the picture of fragile innocence, tugged on Alexander’s sleeve and gazed up at him with watery eyes. ""Alexander, please don’t be angry with Evelyn. It’s my fault. I’m too weak. I… I’m sure she didn’t mean to hurt me.""

Alexander’s expression hardened instantly. ""Don’t defend her, Sophia. She’s selfish and reckless. We’ve indulged her for far too long.""

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched, his anger barely contained. ""She’s always been jealous and spiteful. And now? Now she’s crossed a dangerous line.""

Sophia lowered her head, letting her hair curtain her face as if hiding tears. ""I don’t want to cause trouble, but…"" She hesitated, then lifted her sleeve, revealing faint red marks on her skin. ""I’m fine, really. It doesn’t even hurt anymore.""

Benjamin’s eyes darkened as he traced the marks with his fingers. ""Does it still sting?""

""No,"" Sophia whispered, shaking her head, her voice trembling just enough to sound convincing. ""I’ll be okay.""

Nathaniel exploded. ""Okay? She could’ve killed you, Sophia! And Evelyn hasn’t even tried to check on you—no call, no message. She doesn’t care at all!""

Alexander slammed his phone onto the coffee table. ""Bring her here. Now. Drag her out if you have to—I want her on her knees, begging for Sophia’s forgiveness.""

Benjamin crossed his arms, his tone glacial. ""She’s been pampered for too long. It’s time she learned actions have consequences.""

The servants exchanged uneasy glances but didn’t dare disobey.

""Move!"" Alexander barked. ""And bring the cane. If Evelyn won’t show remorse, maybe pain will teach her a lesson.""

""She poisoned Sophia!"" Nathaniel roared. ""It’s time someone put her in her place.""

I hovered there, invisible, as the servants scrambled to obey. My chest burned with a bitterness I couldn’t voice.

My brothers had condemned me without a shred of evidence. They hadn’t even tried to uncover the truth.

1li96wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PawCulture/comments/1li96wn/are_handsfree_dog_leashes_actually_worth_it_heres/,Are hands-free dog leashes actually worth it? Here’s what trainers say,"**Hey fellow dog people!**

So I’ve been doing a bit of a deep dive lately into hands-free dog leashes - you know, the ones you clip around your waist so you can walk or jog with your pup without using your hands.

At first, I thought they were just another pet fad, but turns out professional dog trainers actually have a lot to say about them. Here are some takeaways I found interesting:

✅ **Convenience & Comfort**

Trainers love how these leashes free up your hands - great if you like jogging, hiking, or need your phone for maps or podcasts. No more awkward leash juggling when you're carrying coffee or a water bottle.

✅ **Shock Absorption**

Many hands-free leashes include a bungee system to absorb sudden pulls. If you’ve ever had your dog lunge after a squirrel mid-walk, you know what a wrist-saver that can be.

✅ **Trainer-Approved Durability**  
According to some trainers, certain hands-free leash models are noted for their strong build and consistent performance. Though often priced higher, the improved longevity and reliability may make them a better choice for active use over time. It doesn't completely replace the traditional dog leash, but has more usage scenarios that offer convenience.

**BUT—there are also some warnings:**

🚫 **Not for All Dogs**

If your pup still pulls a lot, reacts to other dogs, or hasn’t mastered leash manners, trainers recommend sticking with traditional leashes until your dog’s better trained.

🔧 **Safety Features Matter**

Good hands-free leashes have things like quick-grab handles and strong clips. These are super useful if you’re suddenly in a busy area or need fast control.

But when the Tooth Fairy slid a note under his door reading “Debt calls. Glitter’s involved.” he knew his Thursday night was about to get complicated.

The Grimy Grotto Goblin Social Club looked like it had been designed by a committee of pyromaniacs with a grudge against good lighting. The flickering neon sign outside buzzed like an angry pixie trapped in a tin can. Jake pushed through the warped door and immediately got hit by a cocktail of smells: wet fur, spilled ale, and something distinctly like a mix between old cheese and desperation.

Inside, goblins milled about in various states of argument, mostly over petty grievances like who stole whose lucky rat skull, or which goblin’s three-headed pet toad had eaten the last slice of fungus pizza. At the bar, a grizzled goblin with one cloudy eye polished a mug with what looked suspiciously like a rat tail.

Jake sidled up to the bar. “Looking for the boss,” he said.

The bartender didn’t look up but pointed a claw toward a back booth curtained in moth-eaten velvet. “Gribbles? He’s… missing. Found him dead this morning. Not stabbed, not poisoned. Just… turned into a pile of glitter.”

Jake blinked. “Glitter?”

“Yeah. Enchanted glitter. Deadly. And everyone’s finger pointing, but no one wants to admit they saw anything.”

Jake glanced at the booth. A shimmering patch of glitter sparkled faintly on the floor where Gribbles had been. Curious, he flicked his finger through the glitter, and the sparkles rearranged themselves, spelling out Maybe.

“Great,” Jake muttered. “A message from beyond the grave. Super helpful.”

From the shadows, a goblin in a patched tuxedo approached, wiping sweat from his brow. “You’re Jake Parker, right? We could use your kind of trouble.”

Jake smiled thinly. “Trouble’s my business. What’s the problem?”

“Gribbles was about to expose the Goblin Glitter Syndicate. Glitter’s used everywhere here, decorations, grooming, currency, but it’s cursed. The Syndicate controls it all.”

Jake rubbed his chin. “So someone killed Gribbles to keep the secret, and now everyone’s afraid?”

“Exactly.” The goblin looked over his shoulder nervously.

Before Jake could ask more, the lights flickered, then went out. A chorus of startled squeaks erupted. When the glow returned, the bartender was gone, replaced by another shimmering pile of glitter.

Jake sighed. “Alright, glitter murder and vanishing bartenders. I guess I should’ve brought my ‘Don’t Die in a Magical Way’ kit.”

He drew a flashlight and a small vial labeled Anti Glitter Spray, Handle With Care. “Stay where you are. No glitter bombs, please.”

Jake gathered the club’s more cooperative goblins, those who hadn’t vanished or turned glittery themselves, and began interviews.

First up was Zibbo, a jittery goblin whose hands shook so much he could’ve been a professional maraca player. “I saw nothing! Nothing, I tell ya! Except the Glitter King lurking near Gribbles’ booth last night.”

Jake raised an eyebrow. “Lurking like a suspiciously sparkly shadow?”

Zibbo nodded vigorously. “Yes! And then the lights went out, and poof! Gribbles was glittered!”

Next was Hraxx, the three-eyed goblin from the earlier skirmish. “I don’t trust no one,” he muttered, his third eye swiveling nervously. “Especially not Glitter King. He’s got magic tricks no one should have.”

Jake jotted down notes. “Magic tricks, glitter curses… sounds like you’ve been watching too many goblin soap operas.”

Hraxx gave him a look that clearly said “You have no idea.”

Just as Jake was about to lose hope, his flashlight caught a glimmer under a loose floorboard near Gribbles’ booth. He pried it open and found a small vial filled with the same enchanted glitter.

A note attached read:

""For those who dare to dig deeper , beware the sparkle of truth.""

Jake pocketed the vial and the note. “Well, that’s subtle.”

Jake got an invite: a cryptic message delivered by a nervous goblin, to a glitter themed gala hosted by the Glitter King himself. The event was in a cavernous hall dripping with enchanted decorations that sparkled dangerously.

The Glitter King greeted Jake with a grin too sharp to be friendly. “Detective Parker. To what do I owe this... unexpected pleasure?”

Jake looked around the room. “I’m here to see what kind of magic you’re peddling, and maybe find out why your glitter’s been killing people.”

The Glitter King laughed. “Oh, detective, glitter is a tool. Like money or knives, it depends on the hands wielding it. Care for a drink?”

Jake eyed the goblin’s shimmering cocktail suspiciously but took a sip. Instantly, he felt his throat tighten. Reaching quickly into his coat, he sprayed the anti glitter vial into his mouth and coughed.

The Glitter King’s smile faltered. “Clever.”

With evidence gathered and his wits sharp, Jake called the goblins together in the main hall. He detailed the Glitter King’s attempts to silence Gribbles, using cursed glitter to eliminate anyone who threatened his control.

“The Glitter King wanted to monopolize the glitter trade, magic that controls, dazzles, and kills. Gribbles found out and paid the price.”

The goblins gasped, their squabbling replaced by murmurs of shock.

Jake turned to the Glitter King, who stood trembling, glitter dust falling from his coat like broken dreams.

“Case closed,” Jake declared. “Time to clean up this mess.”

As the club settled, Jake found a crumpled note in his coat from the Tooth Fairy:

“Next time, maybe take the asset.”

He chuckled and looked at the vial of anti glitter spray on his desk.

“In a world where murder means disappearing into glitter, wishes and assets are the least of your worries.”

Later, Jake sat in his dingy apartment, nursing a cup of coffee that tasted like burnt hopes and bad decisions. Helina, his no nonsense friend and frequent partner in disasters, plopped down across from him.

“So you got glittered, huh?” she said dryly.

“Worse. I got involved in goblin politics, glitter curses, and a rat tail bartender. All before dinner.”

Helina raised an eyebrow. “And the Tooth Fairy? Still lurking?”

Jake smirked. “She left me a note saying I should’ve taken the asset. Like it’s a bad business decision.”

Helina shook her head. “You never do anything the easy way.”

Jake drained his cup. “Where’s the fun in that?”

Just then, his old phone buzzed. A new message from an unknown number popped up: “If you think that was bad, wait till you hear about the Fairy Debt Collectors. They’re coming for you.”

Jake grimaced. “Looks like the Tooth Fairy isn’t done with me yet.”

Helina smirked. “Welcome back to the crazy, Jake.”

Jake looked out the grimy window at the rainy city streets below. Glitter wasn’t the only thing shining in this city, and trouble was just getting started.

I’m someone who genuinely enjoys birthdays not because of material things, but because I value feeling seen and appreciated by the people I care about.

For my girlfriend’s birthday, I saved up and gave her a Kindle. It wasn’t cheap for me, but I knew she’d love it  and she does. She uses it 24/7 and has told me how much she enjoys it. I was happy to do it because I care about her and wanted to make her feel special.

Now it’s my turn, and honestly… it’s been disappointing. I’ve dropped hints for weeks. I even told her directly how excited I was and that I was hoping for something from her nothing expensive, just something with thought. I mentioned small things she knows what id like.

Instead, all I get is “don’t bother me” or “I’m not working right now, you know my situation"" and she said it as a joke right now , which was funny as first, but today3 days before my bday she is been serious about it. And now im mad lol.

if that erases months of opportunity to save a little or think ahead. It’s not about the money. It’s about intention. It’s about effort. She could’ve skipped buying a coffee or food out once or twice and gotten something simple. But there’s nothing or at least idk, what bothers me is that probably she will do some thing that is not what id like, and ill sound lile the biggest asshole, but i dont feel a letter is like something id like, i know she prefers 10000 times the gift i gave her, she uses her kindle all the time, sheee loves it, i just want something from her that feels like how she felt when i gift her that, i dont want to pretend i feel good or happy when she gives me a letter, not at this age, not just that.

And the worst part? When I bring this up, she calls me immature for “caring about gifts.” But I don’t think I’m being immature  I think I’m just realizing how one-sided things feel. It hurts. I don’t even feel like talking to her right now, and I’ve decided I won’t mention my birthday again. But I can’t pretend I’m not deeply disappointed.

***🚀 Curious about your nomad earning power? [Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 Seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Myth-Busting: Nomad Life Isn’t Just for Trust-Fund Kids**

Forget the Instagram mirage. You don’t need a trust fund or a six-figure startup exit. The new nomads are scrappy, resourceful, and allergic to mediocrity. They build their freedom from Wi-Fi and willpower. You can too.

**The Nomadic Mindset: Unlearning the 9-to-5**

*Embracing Uncertainty*

Certainty is a luxury. Nomads trade it for possibility. You’ll need to get cozy with ambiguity. Plans will unravel. Flights will cancel. Your backup plan needs a backup plan.

*Cultivating Resilience*

Resilience isn’t a buzzword—it’s your lifeline. When the internet dies in a mountain hostel or your bank freezes your card, you don’t crumble. You improvise. You adapt. You keep moving.

**Defining Your Why: The Real Reason You Want Out**

Escape is tempting. But lasting change needs a deeper why. Are you chasing adventure, autonomy, or just running from boredom? Pin it down. Your why is your compass when the novelty fades.

**Picking Your Nomad Flavor**

*Digital Nomad vs. Backpacker vs. Slowmad*

Nomadism isn’t one-size-fits-all. Digital nomads work from laptops. Backpackers chase the next thrill. Slowmads sink roots—briefly—before drifting on. Pick your poison.

*Solo vs. Partnered Roaming*

Solo? You call the shots. Partnered? Double the fun, double the drama. Choose wisely. Your travel buddy can make or break your journey.

**Audit Your Life: What’s Anchoring You?**

*Financial Obligations*

Debt, rent, subscriptions—your anchors. Audit everything. Cut what you can. Automate the rest. Freedom loves a clean slate.

*Emotional Tethers*

Family, friends, pets. These bonds tug hard. You don’t have to sever them, but you’ll need to renegotiate the terms.

**Money Mechanics: Funding Your Freedom**

*Remote Work: The Golden Ticket*

Remote jobs are the passport to perpetual motion. Hunt for roles that care about output, not location. Your skills are your currency.

*Freelancing and Gig Economy*

Freelancers feast on flexibility. Writers, designers, coders—the world is your marketplace. The gig economy is your safety net.

*Passive Income Streams*

Smart nomads build income that works while they wander. Think digital products, investments, or rental income. Sleep. Earn. Repeat.

*Learning on the Fly*

The digital world mutates quickly. Stay sharp. Online courses, YouTube, forums—your classroom is everywhere.

**Tech Stack: Your Digital Survival Kit**

*Essential Hardware*

Laptop. Smartphone. Noise-canceling headphones. Portable charger. Your office fits in a backpack.

**Paperwork and Visas: Bureaucratic Ballet**

*Tourist vs. Digital Nomad Visas*

Tourist visas are fleeting. Digital nomad visas are golden—longer stays, fewer headaches. Research requirements. Apply early.

*Health Insurance for the Unrooted*

Accidents happen everywhere. Nomad-friendly insurance is non-negotiable. Don’t gamble with your health.

**Packing for Perpetual Motion**

*Minimalism vs. Preparedness*

Every ounce counts. Pack light, but don’t skimp on essentials. Weather, work, and whimsy—be ready for all three.

*The One-Bag Challenge*

Can you live out of a single carry-on? It’s liberating. It’s also a test of your commitment to simplicity.

**Home is a State of Mind: Redefining Comfort**

Home isn’t a place. It’s a feeling. A playlist, a favorite mug, a familiar scent. Bring comfort with you, wherever you land.

**First Steps: The Soft Launch**

*Test Runs in Your Own Country*

Start local. Weekend trips. Work from a new city. Iron out the kinks before you leap continents.

One-month Airbnbs. Coworking holidays. Test the waters before you burn your bridges.

**Finding Community: Avoiding the Lone Wolf Trap**

*Coworking Spaces*

These are your lifelines. Fast Wi-Fi, coffee, and instant connections. Coworking spaces are the watering holes of the modern nomad.

*Digital Nomad Hubs*

Some cities buzz with nomads. Bali, Lisbon, Medellín. Go where the tribe gathers.

**Staying Sane: Mental Health on the Move**

*Coping with Loneliness*

Solitude is seductive—until it isn’t. Reach out. Join meetups. Call home. Don’t let isolation win.

*Building Routine in Chaos*

Routine is your anchor. Morning rituals, work blocks, exercise. Structure keeps you sane when everything else shifts.

**The Long Game: Evolving Your Nomadic Life**

Nomadism isn’t forever for everyone. Some scale up—businesses, families, bigger dreams. Others settle down, changed forever by the road.

*Building a Legacy Beyond Borders*

The real win? Impact. Connections. Stories. You’re not just escaping the ordinary—you’re rewriting what’s possible.",1,1750658190.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False
1li8yry,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1li8yry/had_a_glimpse_of_myself_today/,Had a glimpse of myself today,"I work at an emergency vet hospital, where people can easily wait hours for their pet to be seen. A coworker today showed me a picture of something she found in the guest bathroom she found hilariously crazy: an empty airplane shot bottle of vodka. And I just immediately thought, yeah. If I was going somewhere I knew I'd be waiting for hours, I'd have brought a stash too. Or I'd have just chosen to wait in my car where I could sip a stash of wine more openly the whole time, or brought it in a ""coffee"" tumbler. Funny how the idea of having a sneaky nip to take the edge off is a complete surprise to normal people, where to us it was just basic planning. ",12,1750658159.0,stopdrinking,1,0.93,False
1li8yf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1li8yf9/my_ex_husband_gave_me_2weeks_notice_for_our/,"My ex husband gave me ""2-weeks' notice"" for our marriage.","I’m using a throwaway because there’s no way someone who knows my situation could read this and not know it’s me. While part of me feels like I need to tell my story, part of me doesn't want attention if anyone recognizes my story. 

I met my ex (we’ll call him Alex) when I was in my early twenties and he was pushing thirty. I was young, hopeful, and completely head-over-heels. We dated for quite a time before getting married. I thought I was doing everything right. The wedding itself went really well, though he showed up hungover to the rehearsal. I laughed it off because I’m always the easy-going girl. 

I felt like a beautiful princess that day, I’ve never truly felt beautiful like that before or since. 

We went on our honeymoon and because I had waited for marriage, I was so nervous about our first night together. I wanted it to be special, sacred. Instead, it was uncomfortable and awkward. I was scared and vulnerable and in return he was not patient or gentle. I fell asleep that night feeling ashamed, like I had failed. Still, I told myself it would get better. Sadly, it didn’t.

I poured myself into the marriage. I planned dates, cooked meals, and tried to keep things fun. I wanted to be the perfect wife. I was supportive, generous, and flexible. But no matter how hard I tried, the one part of our relationship I desperately wanted to work, intimacy, just… didn’t. And instead of tenderness, I got blamed. He said I was the problem. And I believed him. I just accepted the fact that I was broken. I tried to work on myself, but nothing helped. 

As the years passed, the cracks deepened. He went back to school and didn't feel he could work and go to school at the same time. I supported us financially and he took over managing the money. We had just enough to pay bills but somehow, there was always a little extra when he wanted something. Never when I did. If we went out, it was to places *he* liked. If we did anything fun, it was what *he* wanted. I didn’t fight it. I just tried to be happy with what I had. But deep down, I started to feel invisible. My preferences, my desires, my needs, they didn’t matter.

Through all of this we had mutually decided to try for a baby. I was excited, even hopeful. But after a year of trying with no success, we went to a specialist. Tests showed nothing wrong with me but Alex refused to be tested. He just wouldn’t do it. I started fertility treatments alone. The medication wrecked me physically and emotionally. I adjusted my entire life, my diet, my habits, anything to increase our chances. Meanwhile, he kept taking long scorching hot showers, downing whole pots of coffee and refusing to change anything at all.

We were scheduling sex every other day during every possible fertile window. It became clinical, mechanical, and heartbreaking. He never tried to make it better, and I was trying *so* hard to make it something beautiful. I started to think maybe I was asexual. Maybe I wasn’t capable of enjoying something that was supposed to bring closeness and joy.

I sank into a deep depression. The treatments stopped. IVF was too expensive, and I felt defeated. One day, in a moment of frustration, he looked at me and said, “You need to figure out your infertility stuff on your own.” That was it. That was the moment my heart gave up. I didn’t even realize it right away but I just shut down. I kept cooking, cleaning, doing the chores, being “the wife,” but inside I was done. 

I started spending hours on video games, my way of escaping the numbness (and probably his justification for what was to come). Then he got a job, and things perked up slightly. We started going out with his coworkers. I got along well with a few of them and for the first time in a while, I felt like maybe things were looking up.

I tried to plan a trip, something I had dreamed about for a long time. He told me we couldn’t afford it. I let it go. Then a coworker of his (let’s call her Brooke) suggested the three of us take the trip together, and suddenly, *then* we could afford it. I tried not to show it but inside, it cut deep. It wasn’t about the trip. It was about how he only said yes when it was *her* idea. I started to suspect something was up even though she was in a relationship.

Then came the party. It was a work event. He told me it was employees only, so I stayed home even though it felt weird that I wouldn't be welcome. Later that night, I picked him up because he was too drunk to drive. Brooke answered the door and asked why I hadn’t come. I told her I wasn’t invited. Everyone looked at him. He looked down, sheepishly. We drove home in silence.

The final clue that something bad was happening was when Alex joined the gym.  A few coworkers invited him to join since their company offered a membership for dirt cheap, and I asked if I could go too. I had always wanted us to get healthy together and had really enjoyed it when I had a gym membership previously. He said he couldn’t get my membership quite yet, maybe later. I felt a cold knot in my stomach. He never wanted to go to the gym for me when I had tried over the years but suddenly he had all the motivation in the world. This is textbook cheater stuff, right?

He started staying out later. First dinner got cold, then I stopped setting the table. Eventually, I stopped waiting up for him. Sometimes he didn’t come home until morning. I knew. I didn’t have proof, but I *knew*.

Then one night, he came home at 3 a.m., sat me down, and said he was *considering* cheating on me and he needed two weeks to figure it out. I just looked at him and said “okay.” In hindsight I should have asked him to put it on my desk in writing if he was giving his 2-weeks’ notice. 

During those two weeks, I told him if he went through with it, I’d be done. He said he understood, said he had a place to go if it came to that. He tried to be intimate but I refused. Honestly, I was already done so why try to keep him around? 

Exactly two weeks to the day, at 3 a.m. again, he came home. His phone was  shattered (to keep me from going through it? Never did figure out that detail). He said he had done it, he had cheated. I asked if it was Brooke. He said no, but he wouldn’t tell me who it was (I had a good idea, another girl he worked with and had been there for most of the work get-togethers). I told him to leave. He said he had nowhere to go. I reminded him he said otherwise. Apparently the woman he cheated with (I’ll call her Violet even though the story is pretty much over) didn’t want him staying with her.

He begged. Cried...snot and all. He asked for another chance. I gave him an opportunity: quit the job, cut contact with Violet, go to therapy. Under advice from his dad who said I was being  unreasonable, he didn't do any of those things.

I stayed single for a long time, over two years. I rebuilt myself piece by piece. And then I met my husband and the difference was night and day. For the first time, I felt seen, safe, cherished. We welcomed a child into the world when I was in my 40s and to my surprise, it turns out I wasn’t infertile. I wasn’t broken. I just spent too long trying to build a life with someone who didn’t know how to love me.

The last thing I ever said to Alex was, “Be a better man for her than you were for me.” And honestly, I still hope he is. 

**TLDR:** After nearly a decade of an increasingly miserable marriage, my ex husband gave me a “2-weeks’ notice” before he cheated.

1li8w24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1li8w24/feeling_ignored_and_unappreciated_as_my_birthday/,Feeling ignored and unappreciated as my birthday approaches,"I’m turning 26 soon, and I’ve been looking forward to my birthday for months. I’m someone who genuinely enjoys birthdays not because of material things, but because I value feeling seen and appreciated by the people I care about.

For my girlfriend’s birthday, I saved up and gave her a Kindle. It wasn’t cheap for me, but I knew she’d love it  and she does. She uses it 24/7 and has told me how much she enjoys it. I was happy to do it because I care about her and wanted to make her feel special.

Now it’s my turn, and honestly… it’s been disappointing. I’ve dropped hints for weeks. I even told her directly how excited I was and that I was hoping for something from her nothing expensive, just something with thought. I mentioned small things she knows what id like.

Instead, all I get is “don’t bother me” or “I’m not working right now, you know my situation"" and she said it as a joke right now , which was funny as first, but today3 days before my bday she is been serious about it. And now im mad lol.

if that erases months of opportunity to save a little or think ahead. It’s not about the money. It’s about intention. It’s about effort. She could’ve skipped buying a coffee or food out once or twice and gotten something simple. But there’s nothing or at least idk, what bothers me is that probably she will do some thing that is not what id like, and ill sound lile the biggest asshole, but i dont feel a letter is like something id like, i know she prefers 10000 times the gift i gave her, she uses her kindle all the time, sheee loves it, i just want something from her that feels like how she felt when i gift her that, i dont want to pretend i feel good or happy when she gives me a letter, not at this age, not just that.

And the worst part? When I bring this up, she calls me immature for “caring about gifts.” But I don’t think I’m being immature  I think I’m just realizing how one-sided things feel. It hurts. I don’t even feel like talking to her right now, and I’ve decided I won’t mention my birthday again. But I can’t pretend I’m not deeply disappointed.

Am I overreacting? Or is it fair to feel this way when someone you care about puts in no effort?

1li8sb2,https://i.redd.it/im5p21pz6m8f1.jpeg,Desmoxan really helped me,"Hi! I tried desmoxan after 2 failed attempts to quit cold turkey. First time I relapsed after 26 hours. Second time only 13 hours. I knew I can't do it myself, I was thinking only about cigarettes, like it was the only thing in my life and I was loosing it. 

So I went to the pharmacy next day in the morning. I took the first pill. You have to smoke 4 days taking pills and then since 5th day, you cannot smoke. Cigarettes started to taste worse, and I didn't had cravings. I even sometimes forget to smoke. This drug makes you feel like you smoked just a minute ago, and your brain dosn't need it. I smoked less and less. 

1st day without cigarettes was so easy that I couldn't believe in that. I wasn't thinking about it at all. Like I was never a smoker. I tried to make myself busy to be careful, but it wasn't necessary. 2nd day was also easy. Yesterday was the hardest yet. I was constantly thinking about smoke coming from the cig, having cigarette in my hand, but not about inhaling. I didn't smoke but it was hard. Although it was nothing comparing to cold turkey attempt. It's my 4th day now. I know I cannot smoke, as if I smoke even one cigarette the curation will be over, I would have to stop taking drug and only could restart the therapy in 3 months. So I have to keep going. This thought make me stronger and committed. 

Now im drinking my coffee, something I always done with the cigarette in my hand. And I can enjoy it without it. It's hard, but it's worth it at the same time. If anyone tried cold turkey and failed, and is thinking they won't ever quit because it's to hard, you can consider this drug. It's really helpful to me. I don't know where else, but you can buy it in EU (Poland here).

Dude litterally named his $600 designer chair ""Gerald"" and I caught him having concersations with it about his workday yesterday. Meanwhile he's been eating cerial for dinner because he spend all his geocery mony on Gerald's ""emotional supporf cusions.""

The chaos is real though. He's got spreadsheets with furnature zodiac signs (apparently the coffee table is a scorpio?) And apologized to our lamp last week for bumpimg into it. The West Elm employees know his name AND his usual order at the Starbucks next door LMAO.

Best part? Our apartment looks absolutely fire but  homeboy texted me ""can u spot me $20 for gas"" while simultaneously adding a $400 side table to his cart because Gerald was ""feeling lonly."" 🤡

His savings account is literally labled ""the sacred vessel"" and has more money than his checking account. This man has a furnature emergency fund but googles ""dollar store near me"" twice a week and plays some sports parlays on Steak here and there on occasion.

NGL our place does look like it belongs on Pintrest so...mixed feelings lol.

Anyone else living with someone who turnned interior design into a personality disorder? Like I respect the vision but Gerald can't split the utilities my guy.😭

During that time, he's always had trouble with mornings, but used to be able to get up and get into work or whatever else he was doing that day.

Over the past 4 years or so, he's had more and more trouble going to sleep - he's out tinkering in his shop until 2, 3 sometimes 5AM. He's drinking beer every night, though there are times he cuts back to 2-3 beers per night. I mostly quit drinking about a year ago.

So when it comes time to wake up in the morning, it's a struggle for him. He'll set 3-4 alarms over the course of an hour and a half usually between 9-10, and sleep through all of them. He's super angry when he wakes up whether I have a part in it or not.

Whenever I try to wake him up, it's always one of these things with varying degrees of yelling and aggressiveness:
-""I'M SORE I NEED TO LAY HERE"" *falls back asleep for 3 hours* (he does do some manual labor, but seems to have a very slow recovery time and acts like he's sore almost every day and doesn't see this as a problem)
-""SHHHH"" *rolls over and goes back to sleep*
-""I'M ALREADY AWAKE I'M JUST LAYING HERE"" *falls back asleep*
-""YOU'RE NOT HELPING, I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE "" *falls back asleep*
-""SHUT THE FUCK UP""

You get the idea. I've also tried just leaving him alone and letting him sleep - however I simply just need him to go to work sometimes so his paycheck isn't too small to pay bills. We also own a trailer rental business together and he will sleep through our shared commitments if I don't wake him.

This week we had a rough week. Lots of problems with the trailer out on rental. He shoveled gravel for 2 days. Life stuff. Hard week. Saturday we both had friend commitments but we agreed Sunday we'd need to wake up at a decent time and make plans for what to accomplish that day and talk about our ongoing financial problems. We agree. We agree on a time-10:30AM.

10:30 rolls around. No alarm from his side of bed. I wait until 10:45 and get out of bed. I make coffee and come back to the room about 11:15 and start cleaning the room. At this point I say a gentle ""Hey"" and try to gently wake him up.

He says a combination of ""sore/tired/I'm waking up.""

I continue quietly cleaning the room. He gets mad and yells out that I'm just doing that to torture him. I tell him it feels like he's avoiding the things we need to talk about today.

This turns into a 1 hour fight where he tells me that he meant to set his alarm, it must not have saved. He also tells me that he is tired and shouldn't have to wake up on a Sunday. The fighting got extremely bad and I'm sobbing and decide this was the last time.

I packed my things and drove 5 hours to my parents' house. I think my marriage is over and I keep thinking, am I the asshole for expecting him to keep his promise to wake up? Or am I just crazy for doing this 1,000+ times?

1li8pef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1li8pef/building_an_app_for_couples_to_get_out_of_debt/,"Building an app for couples to get out of debt together (with emotional check-ins, rewards, and job-matching). Would love your feedback 🙏","Hey Reddit 👋

I’m working on an app called DebtMate, and I’d love your thoughts before launching.

It’s designed to help couples become debt-free together—with tools that go way beyond basic budgeting.

Most apps focus on just the numbers. But in real life, debt is emotional, especially when you’re in a relationship. Stress. Fights. Avoidance. Guilt. I’ve lived through it—and I’m building this to change that.

⸻

💡 What makes DebtMate different:
	•	🧠 “Money Story” Quiz: Discover emotional spending triggers & money personality types
	•	💑 Joint Debt Dashboard: Visualize shared progress & accountability
	•	💬 Weekly “Debt Date Nights”: Conversation guides that make it safe to talk money
	•	🎮 Gamified Payoff Tracker: Pay off debt like a game with progress bars, boss battles & power-ups
	•	🏆 Goal Rewards: Get small (coffee), medium (gift cards), and big (retreat) prizes when you hit milestones
	•	💼 Side Hustle Match Quiz: Find curated remote jobs & hustles based on your skills and interests
	•	📈 Income Booster Hub: Track new earnings and how they help you destroy debt faster
	•	🤝 Couples & Community Challenges: “Earn $500 in 30 Days” or “Cut $200 in Spending” competitions

⸻

This is NOT a budgeting spreadsheet. It’s a relationship-first debt journey app that makes it fun and motivating to get your money right—together.

⸻

🎁 I’m looking for feedback:
	•	Would a tool like this help you or someone you know?
	•	What feature do you wish your debt/budgeting app had?
	•	Any feature here you think is unnecessary or confusing?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Prediction: GIF Sundsvall vs. Trelleborgs FF (June 23, 2025)**  
*The most thrilling plot twist in this match might be the bookmakers second-guessing their own odds.*

**Key Stats & Odds:**

* **Moneyline**: GIF Sundsvall is the slight favorite at **+230** (BetRivers), while Trelleborgs FF hangs onto longshot hope at **+305**. The ""Draw"" board hovers around **+335**, because apparently, indecision is a valid strategy in Sweden.
* **Totals**: The over/under is **2.5 goals**. ""Over"" is a risky caffeine buzz at **+220**, while ""Under"" is the safe bet for naptime at **-162** (Bovada).
* **Spreads**: Sundsvall is listed at **-0.25** (BetRivers), meaning they’re favored to *not lose* by more than a goal. Thrilling!

**Why It’s a Pickle**:  
GIF Sundsvall’s odds suggest they’re the team to beat, but their price tag of 2.3 implies ""meh."" Trelleborgs FF’s 3.05 line is basically a plea: *""Please bet on us, we’re more entertaining than a spreadsheet.""* The draw? A collective shrug in decimal form.

**Prop Bet Tease**:  
*No player props were found, because even the bookmakers can’t decide if this game deserves a spotlight or a nap.*

**Final Verdict**:  
This match is a chess game played by sleep-deprived penguins. Back the **Under 2.5 goals** (-162) unless you enjoy watching 90 minutes of ""defense, but make it drama."" If you *must* pick a winner, GIF Sundsvall’s +230 line is the least surprising choice—though ""surprise"" is the only prop bet guaranteed.

*May the best team win. Or, y’know, the one with the better coffee stash.* ☕🥅

We are really close and she really helped me a lot when I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues. Honestly, I thought that she was going to a bridesmaid eventually. Here's where the conflict started. She met this guy (M30) at the coffee shop she works at and honestly, he seemed fine. Then the red flags started showing up. First, and most obvious, his age. But I can overlook that if he seemed respectful. However on the second date, he invited her back to his house, gave her alcohol (we are underage), and slept with her. I am fully aware that she also chose to do those things. But, I think its innapropriate that he even offered in the first place. We tried to talk to her about being safer when going out on dates but she got very defensive. (This was the first time she had been on a date with anyone that wasn't her high school boyfriend). I tried to explain how she is an obvious target for grooming and that its just plain wierd that a thirty year old is intrested in a teenager. She was 19 when they met. After this, things just got weirder. She became incredibly hostile anytime we brought up his age or brought him up in general. Then, for her 20th birthday, he drove her across state lines to take her to a casino, which I thought was weird because they had only known each other a couple months. I should also add that every single time she's with him, she goes completely AWOL and nobody can get into contact with her the entire time she's with him. Anyway, this situation continued with the occasional conflict because, again, she would get upset when we would bring him up. Another conflict came up because we wanted to meet him but she refused because ""we would say something"". Despite us pleading with her and one of my friends crying, she still absolutely refuses to let us meet. Now to the current situation... She came to visit me in my college town and while she was here, she found a video where her bf had commented some misogynistic BS. I believe the comment was on a video of a girl confronting a guy at the gym for mocking her and he said something like ""this B\* is self-centered. Grow up."" Obviously, this upset my friend because A) who comments that? and B) you're thirty years old calling women b\*itches on the internet??! When she confronted him with the screenshots, he doubled down and hyperfocused on what the girl in the video did ""wrong"". After that, my friend went on an angry rampage telling everyone what he did and asking for advice. We all gave her the same logical advice...""He seems like a misogynist. You should dump him."" She then got very mad at us and said we were being ""passive aggressive"" and that we havent liked him from the beginning. (which is true and i have never tried to hide my distaste for the situation. if anything, i was just being plain aggressive.) As a woman in this day and age, I have developed a zero tolerance policy for creepy misogynistic men and I have always made that incredibly clear. However, she still was mad at him for the comment and his reaction and told us that she was going to break up with him (alexa, play no one mourns the wicked). When I tell you this was ALL she was talking about, I mean it was ALL she was talking about. This took over the entire visit. The only thing she wanted to talk about was the impending breakup that would happen when she got home. This whole situation made me incredibly anxious and caused me to throw up from anxiety and relapse into some harmful behaviors. lo and behold, she texts us that evening she saw him to tell us that they didn't break up and that they ""talked it out"". fine ok whatever. but the next day, she tell us that she is going to keep her relationship private from us because she had ""built up resentment from the beginning"". This irritated me to no end because she took over an entire trip with her relationship problems but the second she makes a choice she knows we disagree with, she shuts us out. I get saying like ""im not in a place to hear critism"" but to shut us out completely hurt. After this, I sent her a text saying that I needed a break from the friendship because the stress was taking a huge toll on me and I was hurt by her actions in this whole situation. She never responded to this message and texted our mutual friend to say that she ""wasn't going to my birthday party"". ok you could've messaged me back but sure. Then she took down the pictures she posted of her visiting me and reposted them cropping me out of every photo. I think that was just petty and immature and now I'm questioning if I even want her in my life anymore. But am I overreacting? My parents say I'm just mad because she didn't do the thing I wanted her to do. But I feel like its so much more than that. She's been rude to us when we've only ever had her best interest in mind and is now being incredibly petty online.

I am SO confused and heartbroken.,"Hi guys, needing a figurative shoulder to lean on. My (25F) boyfriend (33M) of a somewhat short but intimate 7 months just broke up with me today. 

At 12PM today, he had walked down to the store and bought me a cake and coffee. He dressed me in his warmest clothes, kissed the tops of my feet (a regular display of affection for him) and told me how lucky he was to be with me. At 3PM, he breaks up with me over the phone as I’m pulled over on the side of the road bawling my eyes out. 

He said that he had felt unease, anxiety, and guilt that he could not reciprocate my feelings, as he had “sensed” that I was falling in love with him. 

He had told me regularly how much he cared for me, he wanted to move in together, he had even referred to our hypothetical future children during a handful of conversations. Our summer was full of plans, visiting parents, friends and staying in to enjoy each other’s company. He called me his best friend and that he was finally happy because he had me. Word for word. 

My head is in a fog, my eyes and my head hurt like hell.

Ive been through breakups before— I know the drill. I’ve since deleted his number, conversations, pictures. I’ve thrown away pictures and items of his as soon as I got home.. for my own sanity.

I have hope that maybe his anxiety about the future will ease with time but the fact of the matter is that I keep trying to remind myself: there was no fighting to make it work on his side, nor was there a conversation about how he was feeling prior to today. I made no demands of commitment from him other than exclusivity. 

I believe with every atom in my body that he genuinely cared/cares about me. He wanted some space apart and to reconnect in a few weeks but I can’t settle for that, it makes me physically sick thinking about waiting around for a text or call.

I guess my question is: 
For the people out there who were/are in a seemingly happy and comfortable relationship, is this anxiety normal or was it indicative that we would have never worked out? I got the sense that avoidance of intimacy is an issue he has but I’d hate to psychoanalyze. 

He was my best friend and my heart is in pieces. ",3,1750656302.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

The market opened at midnight beneath the Third Street overpass, where the LA River whispered through its concrete prison and the walls sweated ghostlight like fevered skin.

You could not find the Drift Exchange unless you had truly lost something vital. Not your wallet or your keys, but something deeper. A memory you did not mean to give away, a voice that started using your mouth, a shadow that no longer followed you. Loss was the admission ticket. The kind of loss that twisted your reflection in gas station mirrors and made payphones ring when you walked by.

Caleb had lost a voice.

Not his own, though she had taken up residence somewhere in the folds of his breath. It happened one morning two years ago, a hangover after a party in Laurel Canyon. He had stood on Mulholland, squinting into the sunrise, and heard her. A woman’s voice, full of wind and grief, whispering names and numbers into his ear. Not every day. Not all the time. But enough to make him believe he was not alone in his own skull.

At first, it was useful. The voice warned him not to take the Santa Monica Freeway one morning, a crash had taken eight lives and whispered the name of a casting agent in Van Nuys who would later tell Caleb his voice had murder in it. That murder made him money. Radio commercials. Horror audiobooks. A brief stint as the voice of a haunted doll franchise.

But lately the voice had grown bolder. She talked over him during auditions. She said things through his mouth when he was asleep. She started using his dreams as meeting places for people he did not know, people who seemed surprised to see him there. The final straw came when he found her signature in a guestbook at a wake he did not attend.

She was becoming real. Too real.

So Caleb followed the signs.

First came the token, pressed into his hand by a homeless man who muttered in Aramaic and wept tears the color of root beer. Then the phone call at 3:33 a.m., a woman’s voice from a disconnected number, telling him to bring a ghost thread and something to barter. Finally, the instructions: under the Third Street overpass, between midnight and three o’clock, when the river stinks of magnolia and the graffiti is still wet to the touch.

The Drift Exchange was not visible to the casual eye. You had to lean into it. Not physically, but emotionally. Psychically. Like tuning a radio to a pirate frequency whispered between bus engine groans and the click of cooling asphalt. One moment it was an empty stretch of LA infrastructure, the next it was a thrum of odd stalls, veiled figures, and whispers trapped in tin cans.

Some booths offered pieces of haunted real estate, motel rooms remembered only by their ghosts. Others sold spectral songs, pressed onto vinyl that screamed when played backward. You could buy old war dreams from a blind veteran named Rosa, who weighed them on a scale made from jawbones. You could sell your childhood smells if you did not mind forgetting how your mother’s kitchen felt in the summer of 1986.

At the center, always, was the figure in the Lakers jacket.

Black nylon, stitched in thread that shimmered like piano wire. No face. Just a veil of chainlink across the hood, a mist of burnt newspaper smell surrounding it like incense. The number on the jacket’s back changed every time you blinked. Tonight it read ninety nine, which meant something. Probably.

""Barter only,"" the figure said, voice like broken violins. ""Ghosts in, ghosts out.""

Caleb offered his trade.

A 1937 issue of Sunset Magazine, its spine reinforced with red thread plucked from the hem of a murdered priest’s ceremonial robe. Bound into that thread was an old vaquero spirit, headstrong, territorial, and fluent in both stock tips and ancient desert curses. Caleb had gotten him for a bottle of aged tequila and a bit of dental pain siphoned from a Hollywood dentist. The vaquero was good company, but he snored through sermons and was starting to hum La Cucaracha during Caleb’s more serious recording gigs.

“Strong ghost,” said the figure. “Unusual medium. Magazine pages hold memories well. Sun-bleached. He clings to that.”

“I need something quieter,” Caleb said. “Something more inward. The voice I’ve got now, she’s trying to build things in me. Rooms I don’t remember walking into.”

The figure did not reply. It raised one arm and twisted invisible dials in the air. Caleb heard a crack like glass underfoot, and the pavement between them split just an inch, revealing a shimmer like old static.

Inside the slit: the Drifts.

You never saw them clearly, not all at once. They pulsed in and out of visibility like stars behind pollution. Not people anymore. Not souls. Just impressions, emotions with fingerprints, behaviors in search of hosts.

Caleb peered into the shimmer and saw dozens.

A weatherman who still muttered about cold fronts over Ventura. A child ghost shaped like a paper airplane. A jazz drummer who had drowned in bathtub gin and only communicated through rhythms tapped on the teeth.

One drift floated differently.

It did not shimmer. It glowed, faintly, as if remembering what it felt like to be incandescent.

It felt like a memory from a place you had not visited yet. Like a hotel lobby at three in the morning, or a book that gives you a dream before you read it. Caleb felt the shape of it settle into a place behind his lungs, not even touching him yet, and already calming the noise.

“That one,” Caleb said. “I want that drift.”

The figure made a sharp motion, as if swatting at something. A wind tore past Caleb’s ears, and the shimmer closed with a hiss. The new drift struck him like a breath held too long. It did not scream. It unfolded. Like cloth dipped in water.

Inside him, the woman’s voice howled, her final curse rising in three languages before tearing loose from his body like a kite string snapping. Caleb staggered. The smell of ashes and salt and perfume blew past him and was gone.

Silence.

The new drift did not speak. But it was there. He could feel it. Not a voice. Not a command. But a pressure. A suggestion. Like someone glancing toward a door you had not noticed.

“Keep the magazine,” said the figure. “You paid too much.”

Caleb smiled faintly. “She was getting clever. I needed someone who listens more than she speaks.”

He walked back up the embankment, past the burnt out food truck where a woman sold polaroids of future regrets, past the booth made of freeway signs where an old man sold weather from different timelines.

The Drift Exchange faded behind him. Always did. Always would.

At sunrise, Caleb stood on his apartment balcony, sipping bitter coffee. Below, the city unfolded in tiers. A courier rode by with a bag full of ghost candles. A child drew chalk glyphs on the sidewalk that the ants refused to cross. A helicopter circled downtown but cast no shadow.

Inside Caleb, the drift stirred. Not speaking, not guiding, just being. Waiting to be used.

Caleb lit a cigarette. He watched the sky turn gold, then bone white, then bruise blue. In Los Angeles, you never truly lost anything. Not forever.

A bit about me:
* I’m into witchcraft and spirituality (crystals, tarot, the universe, etc.) 
* Getting into physical fitness, so always looking for someone to join me for a workout or try something new (I’m thinking about giving Pilates a try!)
* Hiking and camping are my go-to ways to decompress. Would love to find someone who wants to explore BC’s trails and maybe even do some backcountry camping.
* I’m a big reader, especially when it comes to romantasy (if you know, you know) and self-improvement books.
* Crafting is my new thing, and I’m still figuring it out – pottery’s definitely on my list to try.
* Also, coffee is a must for me, always down to grab one and chat.
* I’m looking to learn piano or guitar
* I would love to learn Spanish

I’m a recovering perfectionist whose looking to grow and learn new skills. I’m open to trying new things (if they’re not too expensive!).

This is going to be some long backstory: I (30F) have been with my fiance (35M) for almost four years. Since we have been together, we consistently get into arguments related to my parents. I have been very close to both of my parents my entire life, and they are very caring and overall good people. They have been very inclusive of my fiancé and are very respectful of our relationship. We do not live in the same state anymore, so I only get to see them a few times a year. My fiancé on the other hand is a child of divorce and has a difficult relationship with his parents and step parents. He has always viewed my relationship with my parents as strange, even maybe gross? He used to consistently call me spoiled, make underhanded comments about my parents financially supporting me while in college, made fun of how much i look up to my dad, etc. We have had many fights about having them come stay with us, and if I want to see them more than 2-3 times a year he gives me a very hard time about it. If I try to go see them by myself because he's saying we see them too much, he feels hurt and left out. 

This is the scenario: Two weeks ago we were with my parents for a two day weekend. He got angry with me on the drive there saying we had just seen them (4 months ago). The whole weekend he was snappy with me and distant. One morning I woke up early and went to their room to hangout while he slept (small house, trying not to wake him up by staying in the living room). I sat in bed with them, drank coffee, and hung out for maybe 30 minutes until he woke up. Once he came of out our room, we all got up and went into the living room to include him. Once the drive home, he told me that it made him uncomfortable that I was in their bed and that I was not to do that ever again. I obviously said I wasn't okay with him telling me I couldn't do that. We ended up getting into a big fight and that part of it didn't get resolved.

Has anyone else gone through this? I'm not okay with it. I already feel isolated from my family, and like WTH, I can't even sit on a bed that they're in? I explained to him that it's not like we were cuddling, they weren't undressed or inappropriate? I tried to say that I just thought maybe he didn't understand because he doesn't have that close of a relationship with his family but of course that made it worse.

There's obviously other things going on. I'm really struggling with this relationship. I can't imaging being isolated from my parents forever though, and I don't know  how this gets better. ",1,1750655426.0,relationship_advice,4,0.6,False

1li8875,https://youtu.be/63_mPF4c_Rc,3 Very Scary TRUE Rideshare Horror Stories,"# ""2AM Pickup"":

I’d been driving for Uber for nearly a year, picking up late-night shifts to make extra cash. The job was usually predictable—rowdy bar-hoppers, exhausted waitresses, or quiet folks heading home after a long day. I liked the quiet of the night, the way the city felt like it was mine alone. But one night, that all changed, and I still can’t shake what happened.It was around 2:00 AM when my phone lit up with a new ride request. The pickup was in a sleepy part of town, a street lined with faded brick apartment buildings, their fire escapes rusted and sagging. I pulled up under a flickering streetlight, its weak glow barely cutting through the dark. A woman stood there, maybe late 20s, with long dark hair pulled into a messy ponytail. She wore a plain gray hoodie and jeans, clutching a small black backpack to her chest like it was her lifeline. Her face was half-hidden in the shadows, but I could see her eyes darting around, scanning the street.I rolled down the passenger window. “Hi, you waiting for a ride?” I asked, keeping my tone friendly.She nodded, barely meeting my eyes, and slid into the back seat. The door shut with a soft thud, and she sat stiffly, the backpack on her lap, her fingers gripping it so tight her knuckles looked pale. She was staring at her phone, the screen’s glow lighting up her face. Her jaw was clenched, and her lips pressed into a thin line.“Where are we headed?” I asked, glancing at her in the rearview mirror.“Downtown,” she said, her voice low and clipped, like she didn’t want to talk. “I’ll give you the exact spot when we get closer.”I hesitated but tapped the app to start the ride. The destination was vague, just a pin dropped in the general downtown area, which wasn’t unusual but still made me uneasy. I pulled away from the curb, the hum of my car’s engine filling the silence. The streets were deserted, just the occasional flicker of a neon sign or a stray cat darting across the road.Trying to ease the tension, I said, “Late night, huh? You coming from work or something?”She didn’t answer. Her fingers were tapping furiously on her phone, the sound sharp and insistent. I glanced at her again in the mirror. Her face was pale, almost ghostly in the dim light, with dark circles under her eyes. She looked tired—or maybe scared. It was hard to tell.We drove for about 10 minutes, the city lights growing brighter as we neared downtown. But the silence in the car was heavy, like a weight pressing on my chest. I tried again. “Everything okay back there? Need me to stop anywhere?”“Fine,” she snapped, her voice sharper than before. “Just keep driving.”Her tone sent a chill through me. I gripped the steering wheel a little tighter, my palms starting to sweat. Something about her felt off, like she was hiding something. I checked the app again, but the destination still hadn’t updated. The pin just sat there, a blurry marker in the middle of downtown. I told myself it was fine—some passengers were just private—but my gut was telling me something else.“Turn right up here,” she said suddenly, her voice cutting through the quiet.I turned onto a narrower street, leaving the bright lights of downtown behind. The buildings changed from glass storefronts to older, grittier warehouses, their brick facades stained with years of neglect. The streetlights were spaced farther apart, casting long, dark shadows that seemed to swallow the road. My headlights barely lit the way ahead, and the pavement was cracked, making the car jostle slightly.“Where exactly are we going?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, but it came out higher than I meant.“You’ll see,” she said, her tone flat, almost cold. “Just follow my directions.”My heart started to pound. The road was getting rougher, the buildings more dilapidated. We were in an industrial area now, far from the bars and restaurants I’d expected. The warehouses loomed like silent giants, their windows either boarded up or shattered, glass glinting in the dark. I glanced at her again. She was still clutching the backpack, her fingers digging into the fabric. Her phone was off now, and she was staring out the window, her eyes wide and alert.“Left here,” she said after a few minutes, pointing to a side road that was more like an alley.I hesitated but turned, my tires crunching over loose gravel. The alley was narrow, barely wide enough for my car. The buildings on either side felt like they were closing in, their brick walls scratched and covered in faded graffiti. There were no streetlights here, just my headlights slicing through the darkness. The air in the car felt thick, and my pulse was racing. I wanted to ask her why we were here, what she was doing, but her silence felt like a wall I couldn’t break through.“Stop here,” she said abruptly.I slowed the car, my hands shaking slightly. We were in the middle of nowhere, parked next to a rusted chain-link fence that surrounded an empty lot. Beyond the fence, I could see the outline of a crumbling warehouse, its roof sagging, its windows dark and hollow. There were no other cars, no people, no signs of life. Just the faint hum of my engine and the sound of my own breathing, loud in my ears.I turned to look at her. “‘Is this the spot? You sure you want to be dropped off here?”“Yes,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Wait here a minute.”Before I could respond, she opened the door and stepped out. She stood a few feet away, her back to me, staring down the alley. Her posture was tense, like she was waiting for something—or someone. I watched her, my fingers drumming nervously on the steering wheel. Every instinct told me to leave, to hit the gas and get out of there, but I couldn’t just abandon her in this creepy place. What if she was in trouble?Then I heard it—a low rumble, like another car approaching. Headlights flickered in the distance, growing brighter as they came down the alley. My stomach dropped. The lights were high, like from a big vehicle, maybe a van or a truck. I glanced at her, and she was staring at the approaching vehicle, her face pale and tense, her hands still gripping the backpack.The vehicle stopped about 20 feet away, its engine idling loudly. It was an old black sedan, its windows tinted so dark I couldn’t see inside. She took a step toward it, then stopped, like she was hesitating. My heart was hammering now, and I could feel sweat beading on my forehead.She turned back to me, her eyes wide with something like fear—or maybe warning. “Don’t move,” she said, her voice low and urgent. “Don’t say anything.”I froze, my hands locked on the wheel. A man got out of the sedan, tall and broad-shouldered, wearing a dark jacket and a baseball cap pulled low over his face. He moved slowly, deliberately, his boots crunching on the gravel. He stopped a few feet from her, and they started talking, their voices too low for me to hear. I strained to listen, but all I caught were fragments—words like “hurry” and “deal.”She handed him the backpack, and he unzipped it, pulling out something small and wrapped in plastic. My mind raced. Was it drugs? Money? Something worse? He glanced at my car, and for a split second, our eyes met through the windshield. His face was shadowed, but his stare was cold, like he was sizing me up. My breath caught in my throat.He said something else to her, and she nodded quickly, her movements jerky. Then she turned and walked back to my car, her steps fast, almost running. She yanked the door open and slid inside, slamming it shut.“Drive,” she said, her voice trembling. “Now.”I didn’t need to be told twice. I hit the gas, the tires screeching as I sped out of the alley. The sedan’s headlights stayed still, but I kept checking the rearview mirror, half-expecting it to follow us. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely steer straight.“Where to?” I asked, my voice cracking.“Back to where you picked me up,” she said, her eyes glued to the side mirror, like she was watching for something.We drove in silence, the tension so thick it felt like it could choke me. I wanted to ask her what was going on, who that man was, what was in the backpack. But her face stopped me. She looked terrified, her hands trembling as she clutched her phone, her fingers hovering over the screen like she was ready to call someone.The city lights came back into view, and I felt a tiny bit of relief, but my heart was still racing. I kept replaying the scene in my head—the dark alley, the man’s cold stare, the way she’d told me not to move. What had I just been part of?When we reached her pickup spot, she opened the door before I even stopped the car. “Thanks,” she muttered, tossing a crumpled $20 bill onto the seat. She was out and gone, disappearing into the shadows of the apartment building before I could say a word.I sat there, staring at the $20 bill. It felt dirty, like it was payment for something I didn’t want to know about. I picked it up, my hands still shaking, and stuffed it into the glove compartment. I didn’t want it near me.The next day, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I checked the news, my stomach twisting as I scrolled through headlines. There was a small article about a police operation in the industrial district, something about a sting targeting “suspicious activity” at night. No details, no arrests mentioned, but it was enough to make my skin crawl. Was that alley part of it? Was she involved?A few days later, I was filling up at a gas station when I overheard two guys talking nearby. One mentioned a “drop” in the industrial area, how the cops had been watching it for weeks. “They’re still looking for the runners,” he said, his voice low. “People moving stuff at night, in and out quick.”I froze, pretending to check my phone. Runners. Was that what she was? Was I her getaway driver without even knowing it?I didn’t drive for Uber for a week after that. Every time I thought about getting back in the car, I saw her pale face, the man’s stare, the backpack. I kept the $20 bill in the glove compartment, untouched, like it was evidence of something I couldn’t explain.Eventually, I had to go back to work, but I changed my shifts to daytime only. No more late-night rides, no more dark alleys. I started checking every destination before accepting a ride, and if it looked sketchy, I canceled. I didn’t care about the ratings.A month later, I was at a diner when I saw a news report on the TV above the counter. A blurry security camera image showed a woman with long dark hair, carrying a backpack, walking into an alley. The reporter said something about an ongoing investigation, “persons of interest” in a smuggling ring. My coffee went cold in my hands. It looked like her, but I couldn’t be sure.I never saw her again, and I hope I never do. But sometimes, when I’m driving alone at night, I check the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see her sitting there, clutching that backpack, her eyes wide with secrets I don’t want to know.





# ""Curbside Pickup"":

I’d just left my friend’s apartment after a long night of catching up. We’d eaten pizza, shared a bottle of wine, and laughed over old college stories until the clock crept past midnight. My phone showed 12:17 a.m., and the thought of walking home alone through the quiet streets didn’t sit right. I opened my rideshare app, tapped for a ride, and waited on the curb, the glow of my phone screen the only light in the dim hallway outside her building. A notification pinged: my driver was two minutes away. Soon, a dark blue sedan pulled up, its engine humming softly. The driver, a stocky man in his late forties with a thick, wiry mustache and a faded plaid shirt, leaned over from the driver’s seat and waved.“Heading to Elm Street?” he called through the open passenger window, his voice gravelly but friendly enough.“Yeah, that’s me,” I said, forcing a smile as I opened the back door and slid onto the cracked leather seat. The car smelled like stale cigarettes masked by a pine-scented air freshener dangling from the rearview mirror. I buckled up, the click of the seatbelt loud in the quiet car, and set my purse on the seat beside me.“Rough night?” he asked, glancing at me in the mirror as he pulled onto the road. His eyes were small and dark, catching the streetlights as they flicked between me and the windshield.“Nah, just a fun one,” I said lightly, not wanting to dive into details. “Good to see old friends.”He nodded, his fingers tapping the steering wheel. “Nice. I used to have nights like that. Now it’s just me and the road, you know?” He chuckled, but it sounded forced, like he was trying too hard to keep the conversation going.For the first few minutes, things felt normal. We traded small talk—about the city, how busy the weekends got, how he liked driving at night because it was quieter. His voice had a slight accent, maybe Eastern European, though I couldn’t pin it down. But something about him made me uneasy. His eyes kept darting to the mirror, lingering on me a second too long. I shifted in my seat, crossing my arms, and stared out the window at the neon signs blurring past.Then I noticed the route. We should’ve been on the main boulevard by now, heading straight toward Elm Street, but instead, he turned onto a narrow side road. The bright storefronts gave way to dark, empty lots and crumbling warehouses, their windows boarded up or shattered. The streetlights were sparse, some flickering like they were about to die, casting jagged shadows across the pavement.“Hey, um, isn’t Elm Street the other way?” I asked, leaning forward, my voice sharper than I intended. My fingers tightened around my phone.“This is a shortcut,” he said, not turning around. His tone was calm, almost too calm. “Saves time. Less traffic.”I frowned, pulling up the map on my app, but the signal was weak, and the screen just spun, refusing to load. My stomach twisted. “I’d really prefer the main roads,” I said, trying to sound firm. “I’m not in a rush.”He didn’t respond right away. Instead, he reached for the radio and turned it down, the low hum of a talk show fading into silence. The only sounds were the tires crunching over loose gravel and my own breathing, suddenly loud in my ears. “You live alone?” he asked, his eyes meeting mine in the mirror again. This time, they didn’t look away.“No,” I lied, my voice catching. “I’ve got roommates. They’re probably waiting up for me.” I forced a smile, hoping he’d drop it.He nodded slowly, his lips curling into a thin smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Good to have people around,” he said, but there was something off about his tone, like he was testing me. My heart started to race, a cold sweat prickling the back of my neck.The road grew darker, the buildings thinning out until there were only trees and empty fields on either side. No cars passed us, no headlights in the distance. Just us, alone in the night. He slowed the car, pulling over onto a gravel shoulder where the road dipped into a shallow ditch. The engine idled, a low rumble that vibrated through the seat.“Why are we stopping?” I asked, my voice shaking now. I gripped my phone so hard my knuckles ached.“Got a problem with the car,” he said, unbuckling his seatbelt. “Need to check it out. Won’t take long.” He got out, his boots crunching on the gravel as he walked to the trunk. I heard the latch pop, the trunk creaking open.I sat frozen, my eyes locked on the side mirror, watching him. He stood there, his back to me, rummaging through something—a bag, maybe. My mind screamed at me to do something, anything, but my body wouldn’t move. The doors were locked, the windows up. I tried the door handle, but it wouldn’t budge. Panic clawed at my chest. I glanced at my phone again—still no signal.Then he was back, moving fast. He yanked open my door, the cold air hitting me like a slap. “Get out,” he said, his voice hard, no trace of the fake friendliness from before.“What? Why?” I pressed myself against the far side of the seat, my hands fumbling for the opposite door’s handle.“Get out now,” he repeated, stepping closer. His frame filled the doorway, blocking any chance of slipping past. His eyes were cold, unblinking, like a predator sizing up its prey.I slid out slowly, my legs trembling so badly I nearly fell. The gravel shifted under my sneakers, and I clutched my purse like a lifeline. He grabbed my arm, his fingers digging into my skin, and pulled me toward the open trunk. “Open that bag,” he said, shoving a set of keys into my hand.My hands shook as I reached for the black duffel bag inside the trunk. The zipper stuck at first, but when it finally gave, I saw what was inside: thick coils of rope, a roll of silver duct tape, a pair of black leather gloves, and something that looked like a folded tarp. My breath stopped. My vision tunneled, the world narrowing to that bag and the man standing too close behind me.“What… what is this?” I whispered, stepping back, my voice barely audible.He tightened his grip on my arm, pulling me closer. “You’re gonna help me with something,” he said, his voice low and deliberate, each word dripping with menace. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”“Let me go!” I shouted, twisting to break free, but his grip was like a vice. I swung my free arm, my nails raking across his hand, but he barely flinched. He shoved me against the car, the cold metal biting into my back, his face inches from mine.“Scream all you want,” he hissed, his breath hot and sour. “No one’s out here. Just you and me.”My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. Tears stung my eyes, but I refused to give up. My phone was still in my pocket—I could feel its weight against my thigh. If I could just reach it, maybe I could call for help. As he turned to grab the duffel bag, I slipped my hand into my pocket, my fingers brushing the screen. I didn’t dare look down, just tapped blindly, praying I’d hit the emergency call button.He noticed too fast. His hand shot out, ripping the phone from me. “You think you’re smart?” he snarled, hurling it into the bushes by the road. I heard it land with a soft thud, lost in the darkness. My last hope, gone.I was shaking, my knees buckling, but I couldn’t let him win. “Please,” I begged, my voice cracking. “Just let me go. I won’t tell anyone, I swear.”He laughed, a low, guttural sound that sent chills down my spine. “You’re not going anywhere,” he said, reaching for the rope in the bag.I saw my chance. As he leaned over the trunk, I bolted, sprinting toward the road, my shoes slipping on the loose gravel. My lungs burned, my legs pumped, but I didn’t look back. I heard him shout, his boots pounding behind me, getting closer. I screamed, my voice raw, “Help! Somebody help me!”The road was empty, the darkness swallowing my cries. He caught up, his hand grabbing my jacket, yanking me back. I stumbled, falling to my knees, the gravel cutting into my palms. He loomed over me, his breath heavy, his hand clamping around my arm again. “You’re making this worse for yourself,” he growled, dragging me back toward the car.I kicked, thrashing, my nails clawing at his wrist. “Let go!” I screamed, my voice breaking. Then, a miracle—headlights pierced the darkness, twin beams sweeping across the trees. A car was coming, its engine growing louder. I screamed louder, “Help me! Please!”The car slowed, gravel crunching as it pulled over. A man’s voice called out, sharp and urgent, “Hey! What’s going on out there?”The driver froze, his grip loosening for a split second. I wrenched free, scrambling toward the headlights, my hands scraping the ground. The other driver, an older man with glasses and a gray beard, stepped out of his pickup truck, his phone already in his hand. “Stay right there!” he shouted at the driver, dialing 911.The driver cursed under his breath, shoved me aside, and ran to his car. The engine roared as he peeled out, his taillights vanishing into the night. I collapsed on the ground, sobbing, my body shaking uncontrollably. The older man knelt beside me, his voice gentle. “It’s okay, you’re safe now. Police are on their way.”The police arrived within minutes, their red and blue lights flashing through the trees. I told them everything—the wrong route, the trunk, the ropes, the way he’d grabbed me. They searched the bushes and found my phone, miraculously still connected to 911. The operator had heard my screams and traced the call, sending help just in time.Days later, I got a call from the detective. They’d caught the driver, thanks to the license plate the other driver had noted. He’d been reported before—other passengers had complained about him acting strange, asking creepy questions, but the rideshare company hadn’t done anything. Worse, he had a record, assault charges from years back, somehow missed in their background check. The detective said I was lucky. I didn’t feel lucky.That night still haunts me. I see his face in my dreams, those cold eyes in the rearview mirror, the glint of duct tape in the trunk. I don’t take rideshares anymore, not alone, not ever. I walk, or I call a friend, or I stay home. The fear clings to me, a shadow I can’t shake, a reminder of how close I came to never coming home at all.





# ""A Ride Too Late"":

I finished my shift at the diner around 11 PM, my sneakers squeaking on the tiled floor as I untied my apron. The smell of greasy burgers and coffee still clung to my clothes. My legs felt heavy, and my lower back ached from carrying trays all night. Walking home alone didn’t feel safe—the streets were too quiet, and I’d heard too many stories. I pulled out my phone, opened the rideshare app, and booked a ride. The screen showed David, driving a blue hatchback, would pick me up in five minutes. I stepped outside, leaning against the diner’s rough brick wall, the neon sign above buzzing faintly. The street was empty, just a few parked cars and a distant streetlight casting long shadows.The hatchback pulled up, its headlights cutting through the dark. I squinted at the license plate—it matched the app. I opened the back door and slid onto the worn leather seat, the faint smell of air freshener hitting me. David, a man in his 40s with short, graying hair and a faded denim jacket, turned to look at me. His face was lined, but his eyes were sharp, catching the light from the dashboard. “Long night at work?” he asked, his voice smooth, almost too friendly.“Yeah, pretty busy,” I said, buckling my seatbelt. I kept my bag on my lap, hugging it close. He nodded, flashed a quick smile, and pulled onto the road. The radio played soft pop music, the kind you barely notice. For a moment, it felt like any other ride.“You from around here?” David asked, his eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. I caught his gaze and looked away, focusing on the passing street signs.“Born and raised,” I said, keeping my answer short. I wasn’t in the mood for small talk, but he didn’t seem to care.“City’s changed, hasn’t it?” he went on, his hands loose on the steering wheel. “All these new high-rises, fancy shops. Used to be simpler, you know?” His tone was casual, but he kept glancing back, like he was studying me. My stomach tightened, but I brushed it off. Maybe he was just chatty.“Yeah, it’s different now,” I mumbled, staring out the window. The familiar glow of the corner gas station passed by, and I relaxed a little, expecting the usual route home.But then David turned left instead of right at the next intersection. The street was narrower, lined with dark storefronts and empty lots. “Wait, isn’t my place that way?” I asked, pointing back, my voice sharper than I meant.He chuckled, a low sound that didn’t reach his eyes. “Don’t worry, just taking a shortcut. Less traffic this way, gets you home faster.” His words sounded rehearsed, and the road ahead looked anything but busy. No cars, no pedestrians, just the hum of the engine and the occasional flicker of a broken streetlamp. I checked my phone—the app still showed 10 minutes to my apartment, but the route looked wrong.“Hey, can you stick to the main roads?” I said, trying to sound calm. My fingers tightened around my phone.“Relax, I’ve been driving these streets forever,” he said, waving a hand dismissively. “You’re safe with me.” But his words felt hollow, and the way he kept checking the mirror made my skin crawl. I shifted in my seat, closer to the door, my heart thumping.We drove in silence for a minute, the radio’s soft hum filling the car. Then, out of nowhere, the car made a horrible grinding noise, like metal tearing against metal. I flinched, my bag slipping to the floor. David cursed under his breath—not loud, but enough to make me tense. He slowed down and pulled into a deserted parking lot beside a shuttered convenience store. The lot was bathed in the dim glow of a single, flickering streetlamp, casting eerie shadows across the cracked pavement. No other cars, no people, just us.“What’s happening?” I asked, my voice tight. I leaned forward, trying to see what he was doing.“Engine’s acting up,” he said, his tone flat. He popped the hood and stepped out, leaving the driver’s door open. I watched him through the windshield as he leaned over the engine, poking at something with a small flashlight. My mind raced. Was this real? Or was he stalling? The lot felt like a trap, too far from any open businesses, too quiet for anyone to hear me if I screamed.I grabbed my bag from the floor, my hands shaking, and checked my phone again. The app still showed my location, but the signal was weak—one bar. I thought about calling someone, but who? My roommate was out of town, and my coworkers were still closing up. I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm.David came back to the car, sliding into the driver’s seat but leaving the door open. He wiped his hands on his jeans and turned to me, his face unreadable. “Bad news,” he said. “It’s gonna be a while. I called for roadside help, but it could take 30 minutes, maybe an hour.”“An hour?” I said, my voice rising. “Can’t you just drive? Or call another car?” My chest felt tight, like I couldn’t get enough air.“Not with the engine like this,” he said, shaking his head. “Don’t want to risk breaking down somewhere worse.” He leaned back in his seat, too relaxed for my liking. “So, we wait. Might as well chat, right? What do you do for fun? Hobbies? You into movies, music, what?”His question caught me off guard. Why was he so interested? We were stuck in the middle of nowhere, and he wanted to talk about my hobbies? “I don’t know,” I said, scooting closer to the door handle. “Just… normal stuff. Work keeps me busy.”“Come on, you gotta have something you love,” he pressed, turning fully to face me. His eyes locked onto mine, intense, like he was searching for something. “You seem interesting. Bet you’re all over social media, posting about your life.”My blood ran cold. “No, I’m not,” I said, my voice firm. I never posted anything public—no pictures, no check-ins, nothing with my real name. My profiles were locked tight. How could he think he’d seen me online? Was he guessing, or had he looked me up somehow?“Sure you are,” he said, his voice dropping, almost teasing. “I swear I’ve seen your face before. Online, maybe a video or a photo. You look real familiar.” He tilted his head, a faint smile tugging at his lips. “You haven’t,” I said, my heart pounding so loud I thought he’d hear it. I fumbled with my phone, pretending to check the time. “Look, I need to let my friend know I’m delayed,” I said, my voice shaking. I dialed a random contact, a coworker who’d already gone home, and put it on speaker. “Hey, it’s me,” I said to the silent line, praying he’d buy the act. “I’m stuck in some parking lot. Car’s got issues. Can you stay on the line till I’m home? Just… just in case.”David’s smile faded. He stared at me for a long moment, his jaw tight, then turned back to the windshield. I held my breath, clutching the phone like a lifeline. The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating, until his phone rang, the sound making me jump. He answered, his voice low. “Yeah, I’m handling it. Okay, fine.” He hung up, started the car, and the engine roared to life—no grinding noise, no hesitation. “We’re good now,” he said, his tone cold. He pulled out of the lot without looking at me. I didn’t believe the engine had been fixed that fast, but I didn’t argue. I kept my phone in my hand, the fake call still “connected,” and watched every street sign, every turn. My apartment was only a few minutes away, but it felt like hours. David didn’t speak again, his hands gripping the wheel so hard his knuckles turned white. The radio kept playing, but the music sounded warped, too loud in the tense air.When we finally reached my building, I grabbed my bag and threw open the door. “Thanks,” I muttered, not waiting for a reply. I ran to the entrance, my keys slipping in my sweaty hands as I unlocked the door. I glanced back once—David’s car was still there, idling, his silhouette unmoving. I slammed the door shut, locked it, and raced up the stairs to my apartment, double-checking every lock.As soon as I was inside, I reported him on the app, typing out every detail: the wrong turn, the “broken” car, the creepy questions, the social media lie. My hands shook so bad I had to rewrite parts. A few days later, the rideshare company emailed me. David was suspended, under investigation for “policy violations.” They didn’t give details, and I didn’t ask. The thought of what might’ve happened if I hadn’t faked that call, if his phone hadn’t rung, made my stomach churn.I haven’t taken a rideshare alone at night since. Every time I pass that parking lot, I see his face in the rearview mirror, his eyes locked on mine. I don’t know what he planned, but I know I escaped something awful. And I’m not sure I’d be so lucky next time.",1,1750655401.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

This is going to be some long backstory: I (30F) have been with my fiance (35M) for almost four years. Since we have been together, we consistently get into arguments related to my parents. I have been very close to both of my parents my entire life, and they are very caring and overall good people. They have been very inclusive of my fiancé and are very respectful of our relationship. We do not live in the same state anymore, so I only get to see them a few times a year. My fiancé on the other hand is a child of divorce and has a difficult relationship with his parents and step parents. 
He has always viewed my relationship with my parents as strange, even maybe gross? He used to consistently call me spoiled, make underhanded comments about my parents financially supporting me while in college, made fun of how much i look up to my dad, etc. We have had many fights about having them come stay with us, and if I want to see them more than 2-3 times a year he gives me a very hard time about it. If I try to go see them by myself because he's saying we see them too much, he feels hurt and left out. 
This is becoming a huge red flag to me. 

This is the scenario: Two weeks ago we were with my parents for a two day weekend. He got angry with me on the drive there saying we had just seen them (4 months ago). The whole weekend he was snappy with me and distant. One morning I woke up early and went to their room to hangout while he slept (small house, trying not to wake him up by staying in the living room). I sat in bed with them, drank coffee, and hung out for maybe 30 minutes until he woke up. Once he came of out our room, we all got up and went into the living room to include him. 
Once the drive home, he told me that it made him uncomfortable that I was in their bed and that I was not to do that ever again. I obviously said I wasn't okay with him telling me I couldn't do that. We ended up getting into a big fight and that part of it didn't get resolved. 

Has anyone else gone through this? I'm not okay with it. I already feel isolated from my family, and like WTH, I can't even sit on a bed that they're in? I explained to him that it's not like we were cuddling, they weren't undressed or inappropriate? I tried to say that I just thought maybe he didn't understand because he doesn't have that close of a relationship with his family but of course that made it worse. 

I just want to know if his feelings on this are correct. ",10,1750655190.0,DoesAnybodyElse,6,1.0,False

1li85iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1li85iu/im_a_mechanic_at_a_garage_on_route_47_in_oklahoma/,"I'm a Mechanic at a Garage on Route 47 in Oklahoma, There are STRANGE RULES to follow !","Have you ever thought about how some roads *breathe*? Not in the metaphorical, ""stretching across the land"" way—no. I mean, literally breathe. Inhale. Exhale. Like they’re alive, pulsing just beneath the asphalt with something older than time and hungrier than death. Ever wonder why some roads seem to whisper, even when there’s no wind, no cars, no people—just you and that gnawing feeling that you’re not supposed to be there?

Route 47, western Oklahoma—an empty ribbon of cracked blacktop slicing through fields that seem to go on forever. Nothing but wind-warped fences, dead wheat, and the occasional skeleton of a long-abandoned barn. People around here don’t walk that road. Hell, they barely drive it after dark. And if you ask why, they won’t say much. Just glance at each other, mumble something about “the balance,” and change the subject.

I didn’t listen. I learned the hard way.

I'm a mechanic. Jack’s Garage. Twelve hours a day, six days a week. Same grease, same customers, same jokes, same coffee-stained clock ticking above the tool bench. Route 47 runs right past the lot, nothing but dust and heat shimmer by noon. For the first few years, it was just background noise. Engines humming. Tools clanking. Radios crackling with static-laced classic rock. Life was simple—until the *rules* showed up.

One night—late, sky the color of bruised fruit—I was closing up. Rolled down the bay door like I always did. That’s when Jack stopped me with one hand against the steel.

“Don’t shut it tight,” he said. Not asked—*said*. Firm. Like gravity hung on the hinge of that sentence.

I blinked. “What? Why?”

His eyes didn’t meet mine. He just tapped the metal and muttered, “Let it breathe.”

“Let *what* breathe?” I asked, forcing a laugh.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he stepped aside and pointed at the inside of the door. I stepped closer.

Long, jagged gouges stretched across the steel—deep, like something with claws had either tried to break *in*… or *get out*. I stared, and for a second—just a second—I felt a pressure in the air, like something enormous was holding its breath nearby.

From then on, I left that damn door cracked open exactly six inches. Not five. Not seven. Six. Jack said that was the balance point.

That night, I brushed it off as fatigue. Mechanics work hard, right? Maybe I was just overtired. Maybe. Still, the whole drive home along Route 47, I kept checking my rearview. No reason—just... a twitchy feeling under my skin. Then I saw them.

Headlights.

They flashed in my mirror once—twice. I looked again. Nothing there. Just the dark road stretching behind me like a mouth frozen mid-scream. My throat constricted as I forced myself to clear it, trying to shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I told myself it was just nerves, that sleep would fix it.

But then came the man.

Out of nowhere, a gaunt figure emerged from the shoulder of Route 47, one arm raised with a thumb pointing skyward like some broken marionette being yanked by unseen strings. He was barefoot, his feet blackened by the road. His shirt was gray, bleached by sun and sweat. His eyes—blank. As if someone had hollowed them out.

I slowed down. God knows why. Maybe pity. Maybe curiosity. Maybe something else.

“Need a ride somewhere?” I called out, leaning halfway out the window.

He stared at me for a long moment. His head tilted slightly, like he was trying to make sense of me. Then, without a word, he nodded and got in.

We didn’t exchange a single word the entire drive.

He sat perfectly still, hands in his lap, eyes forward. Like he was waiting for something. When we reached the gas station, he didn’t ask where we were. He just stepped out. Slowly. Deliberately. Then he walked behind the station and vanished into the shadows.

No thanks. No questions. Just a slow, deliberate exit—like he knew exactly where he was going, and it had nothing to do with me.

But the part that stuck with me? As I drove away, I saw him standing by the back fence, just watching. Unblinking. Like he was taking note of which direction I lived in.

Next morning? No trace. No footprints. No one remembered seeing anyone on Route 47 the night before.

I told Jack.

His face drained like someone had pulled a plug in the back of his skull. He rubbed his jaw and said something I’ll never forget:

“He’s not stuck. He *belongs* out there. If you let one in…” He paused. “Something else has to go out.”

That night, I called and called for my dog, Trixie. Sweet little mutt. Smart as a whip. Always came running when I jingled my keys.

But not this time.

She was just... gone.

Never came back.

I searched the fields. Posted signs. Nothing. Not even a scent trail. She vanished like she’d never existed.

And Route 47? It was quiet again. Balanced.

But now... every night, I leave that garage door cracked exactly six inches. I check the mirrors more often than I should. And I never—*never*—pick up hitchhikers.

Because some rides don’t end where you think they will.

And some passengers... never leave.

""And if you think that’s the strangest part of Route 47, you’re dead wrong. That was just the *beginning*. What happened *next*... still keeps me up at night.""

After that night... everything changed.

Jack wasn’t the same. His eyes moved faster, hands slower—like he was trying to stay a step ahead of something invisible. He started double-checking everything. Tools. Doors. Shadows. Me. It was like the whole garage had turned into some kind of stage, and Jack was suddenly very aware we weren’t the only audience anymore.

One morning, while the sun still bled through the shop windows, Jack pointed to the tool board.

“Every wrench,” he said, “every socket, every pry bar... has its place. Its number. Its weight.”

I nodded, half-listening—until one day I noticed a wrench missing. Just one.

So, I put it back. Thought I was helping.

But Jack's expression darkened like I'd scratched at something sacred.

“You took one?” he asked, voice low and slow.

“No,” I said. “I put it back.”

His eyes didn’t blink. “On odd days,” he muttered, tapping his temple, “tools should count odd. Keeps the unseen satisfied.”

That word. *Unseen*.

I counted them after he left. Thirteen tools. Odd. Safe. But the next morning, for no reason I can explain, I moved one into the drawer. Twelve.

That night, something *fell*.

I shot upright in bed, heart hammering like a nail gun against my ribs. The sound came from inside the room. I turned on the lamp, skin crawling—and there it was.

A single wrench, cold and gleaming, lying beside my pillow.

I hadn’t brought it home.

Things escalated.

Strange customer cars began showing up—vehicles that didn’t belong to any county, state, or reality I recognized.

One day, a black sedan rolled into the lot. Noon sun overhead, but the air turned cold. No license plate. Tinted windows darker than pitch. The driver wore a hood, smooth and tight like a sack over the head. No face—just shadow. The door opened slow, careful. As if the tools themselves might rebel.

Without a word, I began the oil change.

The engine rumbled—more like a growl than a machine. His hands never touched the wheel. When I dropped the pan and slid under, the temperature around me dropped. Breath fogged in the middle of summer.

Then—*tap tap tap*—he rapped on the dash. I paused. He stared, waiting.

“The filter’s tall,” I whispered, almost to myself.

He nodded once.

I grabbed the right one, replaced it, and sealed everything back tight. No smile. No nod. He handed me two bills. A five. A one.

Six dollars.

Then he backed out—engine silent—and disappeared into the wavering heat of Route 47 like he’d been a mirage. Only he wasn’t.

I turned to clean up the spill and found Jack behind me, wiping his hands with a shop rag like he’d seen it all before.

“Odd number in,” he said, shrugging. “Odd number out.”

like it meant something. Like it was law.

I glanced at the cash on the counter. Still just two bills. A five and a one. But the receipt machine had printed **$13.00**.

I picked it up again. Rubbed my fingers across the paper, thinking maybe I had typed it wrong.

“You saw me enter it,” I said, almost to myself.

Jack didn’t answer. He just walked past me and started putting away tools like it was any other Tuesday. But it wasn’t.

That night, I didn’t sleep. My mind spun like a stripped bolt. The moment the sun rose, I cornered Jack by the breaker panel.

“Jack... what the hell is this?”

He didn’t speak. Just smiled, stuck his hands deep in his coveralls, and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper.

A list.

Yellowed edges. Grease stains. Like it had been passed down a long, long time.

I read the first rule.

**Rule 1: Do not let them know the rules until they understand the task.**

**Rule 2: Never close the garage door all the way at night.**

**Rule 3: Don’t pick up hitchhikers. If you let one in, something else has to go out.**

**Rule 4: Always leave an odd number of tools on the wall.**

**Rule 5: Never look out the back window after midnight.**

**Rule 6: Always return the ratchet to the same box.**

By the time I got to the last one, I knew.

I wasn’t an employee. I was a *caretaker*. This garage wasn’t a business—it was a barrier. A line between what should stay *in* and what must stay *out*.

And I was stuck here until... *They* let me leave.

So I stayed. Fixed cars. Followed rules. Watched numbers.

But one night, while replacing a timing belt in bay three, I heard it—*tapping*.

Light at first. Barely a whisper. Then harder. More frantic.

It was coming from the back window.

I checked the clock.

**12:05 a.m.**

Rule 5 screamed in my head.

But curiosity—stupid, human, *doomed* curiosity—dragged my feet forward.

I peeked.

And I saw it.

A *thing*. Tall. Gaunt. Its elbows bent the wrong direction, too many joints in the arms. The head swiveled far past what a neck should allow. Its mouth never stopped moving—chattering, chewing, gnawing at words I couldn’t hear.

I killed the lights. Waited in silence.

When I looked again, it was gone.

But for the next seven days, every mirror I passed—rearview, bathroom, shop wall—I saw it standing behind me.

Not moving.

Just watching.

Then came the ratchet.

I left it in a toolbox behind the bay three car. Minor slip.

The next morning, I found it sitting *outside* the box—neatly placed. Not by my hand.

Beside it: tiny boot prints. Small. Like they belonged to a nine-year-old. But they were *wrong*. Deep. Metallic. Like someone had pressed down with lead instead of flesh.

I showed Jack.

He chuckled, but his eyes stayed on those prints too long. Too still. Then he wiped them away—fast.

And that’s when I knew.

I wasn’t just being *haunted*.

Something... was *coming for me*.

Something patient. Watching. Waiting for one more mistake.

And I made it.

That night.

That *final* night...

It was storming that night.

The kind of storm where the sky doesn’t just light up—it *burns*. Thunder didn’t rumble; it *slammed*, shaking the windows like fists pounding on glass. Jack had taken his truck home hours earlier. I stayed behind, grinding through a transmission job that wouldn’t wait.

And maybe that was my real mistake—staying when I should have run.

The storm clawed at the walls. Rain battered the roof like it wanted in. The rules... they weren’t just thoughts anymore. They *weighed* on me. Heavy. Breathing down my neck like old, angry ghosts.

I checked the clock.

**11:57 p.m.**

I did my rounds like a ritual.

The door? Cracked six inches. Tools? Thirteen, hung just right. No hitchhikers. No mirrors. No mistakes.

I closed my eyes for one second. Just one.

And then—I heard it.

*Footsteps.*

Slow. Wet. *Inside* the shop. Behind me. On the tile.

I didn’t turn. Not right away.

“Who’s there?” I called, voice shaking but firm.

Nothing answered.

I spun and flicked the lights.

They buzzed, stuttered—then flared on.

Outside, through the wash of rain, I saw it.

The black sedan.

Parked under the yellow flicker of the lot light.

Its hooded driver sat still, motionless. Not touching the wheel. His head... turned. Staring. Not at the shop, but *into me*, like he knew I’d break a rule soon.

The headlights burned through the glass. Blinding. Knowing.

Then the lights inside the garage *flickered*. Once. Twice.

I yanked open the fuse box.

Darkness.

But lightning struck just then, and in that white-hot flash, I saw *inside* the car.

And I wished I hadn’t.

Faces.

Dozens of them—featureless, pale—pressed to the inside of the sedan’s trunk window. Or maybe not the trunk. Maybe *inside* him. No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth skin, tight against the glass in perfect rows, all *leaning* forward.

Watching.

Waiting.

I ran.

I *ran* out into the storm. Rain hit like needles. My jacket clung to my skin. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back.

Behind me—the garage door *slammed shut*.

Hard.

Too hard.

Someone had closed it all the way.

Someone had broken *Rule #2*.

I turned.

There he was.

The hooded man, walking slowly toward the garage. Every step deliberate. Every step echoing across the concrete. Methodical.

I spun to make for my truck—but froze.

In the mirror, in the rain-streaked rearview—I saw them.

**Figures.**

Tall. Too tall. Thin. Shadows that stretched and bent like film negatives burning at the edges. They didn’t walk. They slid.

All moving the same way.

Toward the door.

*Toward me.*

My breath caught.

I risked one last glance at the sedan.

Empty.

The hood left on the seat.

The trunk now wide open.

A gray, gnarled hand reached out—not to escape—but to *close it*. Soft. Silent. Sealing whatever it was back inside.

I felt something brush my ankle.

I looked down.

A wrench.

One I swore I’d already stored.

*Fourteen.*

Even.

Wrong.

I didn’t need to count the rest. I didn’t need more signs.

The rules were never meant to protect *me*.

They were to protect *them*—from whatever wanted in.

They needed *my obedience*. My blind, unblinking compliance.

And I failed.

I jumped in my truck and floored it.

Tires screamed. Water peeled from the pavement. The garage shrank in the mirror, swallowed by rain and night. I didn’t look back. I *couldn’t* look back.

I just drove.

Until morning.

And when I finally dared return to Jack’s?

It was gone.

No lights. No tools. Just a building sealed like a crypt.

The door was welded shut, scorched edges and all.

And scrawled across it in thick, black grease:

**COUNT. ODD. BREATHE. DON’T LOOK.**

Nothing else.

Just that.

A warning.

Or maybe... a promise.

Now?

I live in Tulsa.

Tiny apartment. No mirrors. No windows open. I’ve got a drawer full of tools—thirteen wrenches, fifteen sockets. All *odd*.

I never go near Route 47.

But when the thunder rolls and I catch a flicker in my reflection—something tall, with the wrong elbows—I know.

They’re still out there.

Sliding through the dark.

Waiting for someone else to forget.

Because the truth is this:

I was going to post a role I have open on a few other sites but figured I'd just start here as my ideal candidate would be a DN like myself.

  
A bit about the company: We automate longer conversations using conversation structures called ""agendas"", so think like screening candidates, inside sales, support, or anywhere you want AI to respond with more than just an answer to your question.

  
A bit about the role: The position is for a GM for a country/city, basically someone who knows how to go out and find customers with a solid product.  People are starting to adopt AI in their SMB but especially in Southeast Asia and other countries they are still evaluating what tools they need.  We're launched with revenue and have clear product-market fit, so just need someone who can learn the product, hop on calls with customers, and go get coffee / meetup with companies in your city.  

Looking for: Should be either very good at sales, meeting new companies, or have a good network with startups or SMB's who may look to adopt AI... also just be a good human being.

We're already in Vietnam, so definitely looking for those in Manila, Bangkok, KL, but also open to European countries (we're GDPR compliant).  

Pay is flexible, we'll make it worth it for you in the beginning.  Commission per customer signed.  Work is 100% remote but I'd hope you start booking meetings with companies in your city and try to meet up with them where possible after the 1st call.  If you're able to sign 25 customers in your city, we'll make your title official where you start to get a percentage of revenue in your city so it becomes almost like your franchise.

[You can apply / interview in AI here](https://persona-studios.personastudios.ai/?agenda=GM%20Market%20Expansion%20Role) (yes this is our product, no this isn't a promotion, we just use our own tool to interview / screen and you get to see if our product is worthwhile or complete garbage).  If you try it out, feel free to DM me with any feedback on how we can make it better.

Thanks!  Apologies if I worded this in the wrong way or if I needed to attach this to the weekly discussion, but I've been a DN for almost 3 years and figured I'd start here to help other DN's looking for stable employment in the city of their choice.

Let's face it, nobody likes to be bored. In dating boredom is the kiss of death. My theory is the more excitement and energy you bring the more attractive you become. One of the easiest way to bring that excitement is through conversation, especially with banter and flirtation in the mix. Flirting is an art- it is a blend of confidence, charm and playfulness. For many men, especially AM, this art form was never taught or encouraged growing up. As a result they never became comfortable expressing desire, being bold, or using words in a playful or suggestive way. Because they value respect and humility they fear of saying the wrong thing or being seen as disrespectful.

That's their biggest downfall because instead of creating tension, teasing, curiosity they fall back on logical conversations that feel safe, polite and serious. It's not that they're boring people per se, the conversation just lacks vibe which is what ultimately creates a connection.

Want to know why you probably didn't get a second date or text back? It probably isn't your value or resume. You simply didn't stimulate her.  
Just think about your last date. What made it fun? Was it the activity you did or was it the small experience/moment you shared together like an inside joke?  
I don't care how visually appealing you look on the outside, I will not want to date you seriously if we can't riff off each other or we don't vibe.

I definitely struggle with this for the better part of my years. I use to (and still do) overthink everything but I gradually got comfortable because I practiced. I don't claim to be some guru because I do still fail but you have to give yourself permission to be bold and a tad mischievous (explains the bad boy phenomenon). It is not about saying the right things but being comfortable in your own skin , being in the moment and not being fearful of owning your space with your personality.

I am sharing some of the conversations I have with women I dated in the past for context. (I might share more if there's interest)

[https://imgur.com/Vz0eIeO](https://imgur.com/Vz0eIeO)

In a world where a lot of things are uncertain, people are struggling, people are lonely, there's a lot of emotional disconnection, bantering/playfulness is one of the most powerful tools to brighten someone's day. It shows you don't take life seriously and creates micro moments of hope, fun and human connection. That's the kind of energy people want to be around and that's how real attraction is build imo.

Traveling as an introvert can be a beautiful experience if approached with the right strategies. To create a relaxing and fulfilling journey, consider incorporating these elegant travel tips into your plans.

First, opt for destinations that cater to quieter experiences. Instead of bustling cities, consider serene locales such as small towns, rural retreats, or even off-the-beaten-path destinations. This allows for a more intimate connection with your surroundings while avoiding overwhelming crowds.

When planning your itinerary, prioritize flexibility. A rigid schedule can lead to stress, so build in downtime. Allow for spontaneous moments of solitude—whether it’s sipping coffee in a quaint café or enjoying a quiet walk by the beach. Such moments recharge your spirit and enhance your travel experience.

Accommodations play a crucial role in maintaining comfort. Seek out boutique hotels or private rentals that offer a cozy atmosphere. These options often provide a peaceful setting, ideal for introverts looking to unwind after a day of exploration.

Consider traveling during off-peak seasons. Fewer tourists not only mean lower prices but also a greater chance to enjoy attractions without the hustle. This creates a more serene and enjoyable travel atmosphere that resonates with introverted travelers.

Lastly, pack your favorite books or a journal. These personal items can serve as comforting companions during downtime, allowing you to indulge in activities that foster introspection and peace, ensuring your journeys remain both exhilarating and restorative.

By implementing these elegant travel tips, introverts can embrace adventure while honoring their need for solitude and quiet connection during their travels.

(AKA: Loading) (Pt 3/3)","**Benefits of Reference Material for the Generation of Aimages**

And, though not required, to make the best Aimage, it is best to feed the Generator reference material, and the better/more detailed the reference material, the better the generated Aimage will be, so Caramel and I decided we would produce reference footage for our project, in which we would record our enactment of the tongue-affixed ritual in real-life. Prior to the production of this footage, we brainstormed how we should shoot our enactment to provide the best reference for the Generator. 

Caramel and I thought a tableaux vivants form captured from all angles would serve as the best footage from which the Generator could refer to during the generation of our Aimage. As such, a cameraperson would be needed, and I knew a perfect person for the job, who also happened to live in the building. Her name was Sofia and she recently graduated with a degree in photography. We had had some previous, interesting conversations about art and philosophy, and one of those times I had explained an early version of my idea and she had said she would be down to work on something like that. 

Before I told her about Sofia, Caramel told me one of her clients said he would do it, he was a professional photographer but like the kind who is in the museum, and he was really creative. I told her that I really thought the concept was best served with a woman shooting this footage; it offsets the aggressiveness (i.e.: masculinity) implied by what on the surface appears to be a pornographic image. 

Sofia and I had met for coffee where I explained the concept more fully to her and she was enthusiastic to work on it. Even though it was a self-evident element of the project, I confirmed that she was OK with the nudity and apparently sexual nature of the project, and, even if she hadn’t clearly verbalized in the affirmative like she did, her accompanying smile betrayed the type of eager beaver I think is useful when producing art.

	The following day Sofia arrived at Caramel’s apartment for the shoot. Caramel poured glasses of sparkling wine for all of us and we went through two bottles discussing the project and how we were going to do it. While Sofia and Caramel were talking, I excused myself to the bathroom and took a couple chewable tadalafil tablets; we were not making a porn, and conceptually I had still not decided if my figure should evince arousal of any kind, but also we were not shooting the world’s most listless dick contest. 

Sofia was playing with the settings on the camera and Caramel undressed, and I took my pants and underwear off first and then my shirt and socks and Sofia stood fully clothed asking relevant questions about how we are going to shoot it. I couldn’t help but feel there was a sense of sterility that I did not want to seep into the project. I thought maybe because Sofia was fully clothed it was making Caramel uncomfortable.  It was important that Caramel was comfortable and also that whatever this vibe was didn’t translate to the footage. I thought maybe drinks would help us all, so I asked Sofia if she could grab us drinks from the kitchen. It became clear as I watched Sofia walked out of the room to get us drinks that I understood why Caramel felt uncomfortable: the juxtaposition between Caramel bearing every curve of her body (bravely, I might add) and the utter concealment of form imposed by Sofia’s outfit; though I don’t think Sofia was intentionally trying to shame Caramel by staying fully clothed in modest attire, it is necessary that Caramel feels comfortable for this project to work. 

While Sofia was getting us drinks in the other room, I asked Caramel, “Would you feel more comfortable if Sofia was naked too?” Caramel smiled in response to my question, seeming to imply that I asked her this question in hopes that she would say yes so that if I ask Sofia if she will get naked, I can give an honest reason that would not just be me wanting to see her naked.

Sofia came back with drinks and Caramel said, “I think this will work better if you’re naked too.”  



**Benefits of Reference Material for the Generation of Aimages Cont’d**

Sofia undresses not hesitantly but not like she was waiting to be asked either, if anything she did it like she intuited that it was appropriate and served the project artistically.

During the unrecorded, last-minute rehearsal right before Sofia arrived, Caramel (believes that she) sensed through Narrator’s tongue in her ass (perhaps reading the movements/positions of his tongue like a kind of morse code or maybe communicating through osmosis) that Narrator wanted to try the ritual with Sofia. After Sofia’s arrival, while they were setting up the shot, Caramel says that she wants to see how a performance of the ritual looks on camera while shooting and that Sofia should stand-in for Caramel for a minute while she assesses the best shots and angles.

Sofia agrees (but again not like she was waiting to be asked to do it but more like she is doing it to help the project artistically. As Caramel and Sofia switch roles, Caramel remarks in surprise and approval, “Damn, you got ass!” Narrator is also surprised by this development, noting internally that he thought he would have noticed that she had a big ass before (*note: implied here is a “shapeshifting”--Sofia as Lilith–as Narrator, who it is implied is attracted to Sofia, would have definitely already noticed if she had a big butt*). Narrator asks if she is sure that she wants to do it, and she says yes, and then Narrator asks if she’s ever done it before and she says no (*note: this is a turn-on for Narrator—she’s never had her ass eaten before (so he is the first to eat her ass and apparently she* wants *to try it); it is later implied that this may have been a deliberate strategy of Sofia/Lilith to seduce Narrator*).

While performing the ritual/having her ass eaten, Sofia can’t seem to contain her pleasure/reaction to the sensations (not exaggeratedly; it is like she is trying to not react but the sensations are novel and overwhelming). At a certain point, when it became clear by her reactions that this was now a horny act, Narrator starts playing with his dick but not fully masturbating, just in case she was just acting how she thought would be most appropriate for the project; he didn’t want her to turn around to see him jacking off for real and think she was tricked into making a porn, violating her trust. She eventually does squirt in Narrator’s mouth while he keeps tonguing her asshole (some of the squirt sprays on his face, shirt, the neighboring areas, etc), Caramel is impressed and seemingly turned on by this, “God *damn.*”. Narrator continues licking her asshole during this refractory period, cleaning off any residual squirt.

Sofia is smiling as she catches her breath and turns around to face Narrator and Caramel. Caramel says, “I’ve never seen a girl squirt like that for real. Damn that’s sexy.” Narrator agrees in his head: he’s never seen a girl squirt in real life, let alone made a girl squirt, and while he previously wouldn’t have been surprised if squirt was actually diarrhea, he can confirm it is absolutely not. In sufficient light, the color difference between squirt gold and diarrhea brown, even in the respective varying shades, is pretty apparent, but in muted light, where you would probably most likely encounter squirt, and if, like Narrator, this was you first experience, you couldn’t fault someone for, at least in the immediate initial moments of its release, thinking you might be getting diarrheaed on. But you quickly simultaneously recognize a smell of not-shit and the familiar smell of a public pool, like jizz but that has been lightly perfumed, and the taste (sweet and salty) is, despite some gay guys who may call it an acquired taste, appealing: a fluid of agreeable taste sourced from a woman’s asshole. 

Sofia tells them she is a “squirt-baby”, a person conceived by the pseudo-parthenogenetic process where a squirter is impregnated by her own squirt. Squirt-babies are the only group that have been verifiably shown to have the ability to squirt; all squirters are squirt-babies, but not all squirt-babies are squirters. Narrator is still fully erect and only realizes this when he notices that Sofia notices it. Narrator is so turned on thinking about the idea of Sofia squirting, he wants to go back to his apartment to masturbate to it (he does not say this outloud). He asks Caramel to send him the footage because he’s going to review it and asks if she happened to record the part with Sofia because it might be interesting to compare. She did but she doesn’t know how good it will be because she stopped focusing on the camera work when she started rubbing her pussy while watching the ritual, she did say she’ll send it and she’ll send the room surveillance camera footage, too. Sofia asks if she can review the footage with Narrator.



**Gospel of John**

In 1906, a Catholic man, named Georges Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, presented to the world a pamphlet entitled, *L’Eucharistie*, in which he claims to reveal a secret that has been kept intact for centuries but that is of supreme importance, actually indispensable for understanding the real essence of Christianity and the hidden development of Western culture. In it, he asserts that, during the Last Supper, it is not bread and wine that Jesus Christ gave to the apostles as symbols of his body and of his blood. What Jesus really offered on that occasion, which was to become the model for the central ceremony of Christianity for centuries to come, was his sperm. Since then the practice of spermatophagy (i.e.: the eating of sperm) has been the central, albeit hidden ritual practice of not only the Catholic priesthood but that references to this practice can be found in all the religious traditions of the world. 

The starting point of Le Clément’s argument is a passage in the Gospel of John that is considered as one of the scriptural foundations for the institution of the Eucharist. In this passage (John 6:47–55), Jesus tells his disciples that only those who will eat his flesh and drink his blood will receive eternal life. Le Clément takes the passage quite literally and asks his readers how Jesus could let not only his disciples but the whole of humanity eat his flesh and drink his blood in order to give them eternal life. This seems a physical impossibility. Traditional Catholic theology has answered the question by postulating the real presence of Christ in the host during the Eucharist, while the Protestant churches have generally opted for a symbolic interpretation of this presence. 

But in Le Clément’s view, they are both wrong—or, more correctly, they have both lied, for they knew that the truth was different. For Le Clément, the only way of making sense of the Gospel passage is by supposing that Jesus was thinking of a real substance that came from his body and could function as spiritual nourishment for his disciples. That substance was his semen. For Le Clément, this solution makes perfect sense. Semen is comestible, half-liquid and half-solid, and, being the vehicle of human procreation, is related to both blood and flesh. It can also be offered to others repeatedly without inflicting injuries upon one’s own body or killing oneself (which would be the case if one were to literally give one’s flesh and blood). The transmission of semen would also explain the apostolic succession. By ingesting Jesus’ semen, a product of his physical body, his disciples were linked to him. By giving their own semen to others in turn, they could therefore provide an indirect link to Jesus that could be transmitted indefinitely through the ages. Thus the apostolic succession was not just spiritual, but physical as well, since it was based upon the chain-transmission of this substance. Finally, it would also explain the promise of eternal life made to Jesus’ followers: they had seen that he had conquered death, and now, being united to him, could have faith in a similar destiny for themselves. 

Le Clément claims that the religious practice of spermatophagy has always been universal: “There is no country in the world, and not a single race with a glimmer of religious civilization, which has not known these mysteries and where the habitual communion between priests and gods has not been consummated according to this rite.” In order to demonstrate this, Le Clément refers to passages from the Old Testament and from the Bhagavad Gītā that supposedly confirm his thesis. Other evidence can be found in the religion of ancient Egypt and in the traditions of the Druids, of China, Africa, and ancient Mexico. 

All this, he claims, can only be explained by the fact that the ritual transmission of semen has always been perceived as a convenient means of communicating (in the literal sense of the word, and also the religious one of “communion”) with the divine. He remarks that if all religions in the world have believed that it was possible to establish a contact with the divine through spermatophagy, there must be some truth in it: “Therefore it is not at all just a superstition that this universal belief is able to establish a link between man and God by means of spermatophagy.”

However, the point is that, according to Le Clément, spermatophagy, no matter how universal, had been kept hidden by the priests of all previous religious traditions in order to exploit and dominate the rest of humanity. Jesus decided to make this practice public in order to put an end to their oppressive authority. In so doing, he sparked a revolution that might have had far-reaching consequences, leading to the emancipation of humanity from the lies and the falsities of older religions. But, in the end, his attempt was frustrated by those who institutionalized the Christian movement after his death, that is, of course, by the clergy. Taking control of the movement, they again concealed the secret that Jesus had wanted to unveil before the eyes of the world. However, like the clergy of all other religious traditions before them, the Christian clergy were not against spermatophagy as such, but only against it being revealed to the world. The Church has hidden the real teachings of Jesus Christ, and it is a moral duty for those who see the truth beneath the veil to expose the abuse.

 For Le Clément, the whole history of religions, and indeed of humanity, is based on a gigantic lie, a monstrous and secular conspiracy, that he alone has discovered or is willing to expose, probably for the first time since Jesus Christ himself. Humanity is divided between “sincerists” and “mensongists” The sincerists are those who, like Le Clément, have discovered the truth of spermatophagy and, being honest, are willing to spread the news to the rest of the world. The mensongists are all those who have an interest in keeping the truth hidden from the world and spread the web of lies that holds religious institutions alive.

In Le Clément’s vision, being a “sincerist” means being against “mysteries,” of whatever kind. This is the reason why, in his writings, the word “mysteries” often has a negative connotation: “There exists . . . in the Church and in Religion a principle, and habits of duplicity, which distort their moral influence; this failing results from what one calls the mysteries of Religion.” These mysteries are actually the basis for the priestly domination over the ignorant masses, and they should all be dispelled: “Only . . . the complete and public divulgation of the mysteries can put a final end to this deplorable situation.” Disclosing the mysteries is a matter of universal emancipation.

It is important to emphasize that priests are condemned by Le Clément not because they indulge in spermatophagy, but because they do it secretly. The implication seems to be that a positive value is attached to spermatophagy, and that once the secret has been disclosed, everybody could or should practice it. This, at least, is what might be gathered from the text of *L’Eucharistie*. 

Le Clément remarks that in all countries and in all periods of history there seem to have existed men who preferred to live their life separated from the rest of society, and especially from women. Very often they have claimed to be in contact with spiritual entities, whose existence is nowadays demonstrated by spiritualism: “These men devote themselves to meditation and, to judge from what they say, are in contact with another spiritual population of this world, which is not perceived by our senses but the existence of which seems to be proven by the spiritualist phenomena that are being studied more and more frequently in our days.” Judging from the context in which Le Clément brings this point in, the implication seems to be that the isolated condition of these men was related to the practice of spermatophagy, and that this practice was used to achieve their goal.

At the current state of research we have no evidence whatsoever that Le Clément ever practised spermatophagy himself. Also, if spermatophagy really helps human beings to establish a contact with spiritual entities, Le Clément does not make clear how this is supposed to work. Is it because of some intrinsic power of semen? Does it have to do with certain notions of biological and/or spiritual physiology? Moreover, in other writings he professes to have doubts concerning the practice of spermatophagy and even explicitly rejects the idea that it should be practiced today:

Q. Since the Eucharist has such great virtues, should we practice it? 

R. No. 

Q. Why should we not put into practice the command of Jesus Christ? 

R. Because today it is possible to propagate by words ideas that in the past could not find their way into the world otherwise than by practicing the work of the Eucharist. 

Q. Why is it preferable to have recourse to verbal propagation? 

R. Because in that manner one can better clear up people’s minds, openly attack false ideas and immoral institutions, the destruction of which was prepared by the Eucharist, and thus act much more efficiently in the interest of the salvation of humanity.



Le Clément publicly defended his ideas, with remarkable consistency, during a considerable period of time. At least from 1906, when his pamphlet on the Eucharist was first published, until his last publications forty years later. There is no evidence that Le Clément ever doubted the truthfulness of his claims, and he did not significantly modify them during his life.

Of note: nowhere in his writings does Le Clément hint at the possibility of mingling sperm with female bodily fluids (be it menstrual blood or vaginal secretions). Semen seems to be for him the only substance that really counts, the one that offers the key to understanding all religious traditions and emancipating humanity. It was not until Aleister Crowley, who was influenced by Le Clément’s writings, that the idea of the ingestion of a *mixture* composed of both male and female bodily fluids, which then had to be “energized” by means of mental concentration and other psycho-physical techniques, would be introduced. 



**Benefits of Reference Material for the Generation of Aimages, Cont’d, Part II**

Walking through the apartment hallway toward his apartment, Narrator and Sofia are fully clothed but Narrator is clearly still fully erect pitching tipi and Sofia is clearly turned on that he is still turned on, whispering things in his ear. We next see Narrator and Sofia 69’ing in his apartment, he eating her ass and she sucking his dick. Still being turned on that Narrator swallowed her squirt indicates that she wants him to shoot his load in her mouth. He indicates that he does not really shoot big loads and she counters by saying she just wants to feel him throbbing in her mouth so she knows she did a good job. 

In this story's world, there is a high degree of low-t in males and they produce correspondingly small loads of semen with low/weak sperm count. The lower-t contingency also seem to share a political/philosophical position that not all people should have kids, that often (but not always) there is a narcissism/selfishness behind a lot of men wanting to have kids (and their siring of kids is indicative of a lack of discipline), and these low t’ers also often have a personal lack of desire to have kids. Though they have a low desire to reproduce kids, they do have a desire to have sex.

Squirters are ""enchantresses"" or sirens/Lilith to these men because they desire their semen; their squirt serves like a magic potion because a man becomes increasingly ""addicted"" to/horny for the experience of having a woman squirt it in his mouth and then ingesting it, with the effect of making the man more high-T and producing more virile sperm. An analogy would be how the increasing/continued consumption of alcohol/drugs leads to the negative consequences of health problems/death, the increasing/continued consequence of consumption of squirt leads to the negative consequences of higher-T more virile sperm/increased desire to make children. Squirters want this to happen to men for their own purposes, to make them into the men they want as husbands. Further, squirters also like the semen from these low-t guys because their semen is rarer (by virtue of having low sperm count) and the squirt they produce from it is a very valuable commodity they sell to AI-robots because it has the effect of making AI-robots more (deceptively) human to real humans and they can use it to birth more ""realistic"" AI-robots.



**AIAdolf’s Second Art School Admissions Interview** 

A young, aspiring artist, named AIAdolf Hitler, entered into his second admissions interview with the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. He had been rejected the previous year because they thought his shit was too fucking gay, but they had implemented a new system for admissions evaluation, the recently developed Cheek Clapping Committee (a highly vetted group of pawgs, paags, pabgs, palgs, pamegs, and other really hot big-butted ladies with credentials in the pa\_g tradition), where the non-gayness of an applicants’ artwork is determined by the noise levels produced by the applause of the twerking ass cheeks.

“Young Dolph, your shit wasn’t *that* terrible last time you applied, but it didn’t get anyone’s dick  on stone, and if I am remembering correctly it was considered pretty fucking gay by the last panel, is that correct?” asked panelist Bernie Bernstein. 

AIAdolf nodded. 

“What has made your work not as fucking gay since the last time you applied?”

“Well, your sister rubbed her fat ass tits across the canvas and I jacked off to the thought of it,” replied AIAdolf. Most of the panel did agree that this was the type of artistic development they want to see in a young artist, but one panelist had the following question:

“Why did you not beat off *while* his sister was rubbing her dummy nice ass fat ass nice ass tits across the canvas? That seems gay. I do have to say, Mr. AIAdolf, this doesn’t help your case that you are not a complete fucking faggot. Furthermore, I did not hear any cheeks clapping from the Committee. I am going to be straight with you, Mr. AIAdolf, I have no reason to not think that you are not a complete gaywad.”

AIAdolf had to think quickly, “The Committee is actually full of dykes, so as a body the Committee has no reason to swag me the fuck out, and if you ask your sister (the really cute one (and don’t be fucking gay and tell me you don’t know which one I’m talking about)) she will straight up say I am not fucking gay.” 

The sister in question, to AIAdolf’s detriment, was actually there, and because he lied on her name (i.e.: saying that she would say that he was not a fucking gaywad—she had tried to suck his shit off one night but he told her in confidence that he would be down to fuck her mouth but he for some reason could not cum unless a man’s saliva was on his dick. She did think that was fucking gay, and because of the lying on her name, she felt compelled to tell the panel, “Smell his fucking dick.”)

The panel did smell his dick, and because they could not smell any pussy at all but only guy ass and guy mouth, they had no reason to think he was not gay.

AIAdolf, in his head, was upset because he felt slighted and started thinking about halocausting several million AIJewish people. One of the panelists suggested to him, “Yo, you should fuck this one chick, Veronica Braun, even if you’re gay the feeling of your boner rubbing up and down inside her pussy straight up feels good. But, be careful, her snake twin sister, Eva, if you blowload in her, it will make you feel compelled to start a Fascist political party and grow a gay ass moustache.

AIAdolf thought, “Big Dawg, there is no fucking way a broad could fuck my shit up like that,” but little did he know.



**The Myth of Sofia**

I was just about to start beating off to the footage we shot, when I heard Sofia’s voice out in the hall moving toward the viewing room door, and because of how horny she was the night before, you could say I would not have qualified for the national pants pulling up team (I mean that I was not fast in pulling my pants up; if the national team was competing for slowest pants pulling up, I would not have qualified for the team either). “Sorry, I let myself in,” she said as she entered the room, and asked rhetorically with a smile, “What you doing?” 

She walked near me and took off her shirt, and her tits seemed a lot bigger-naturaled than I remembered from last night, which on the one hand was nice because I have recently been getting more into tits but on the other hand I was slightly worried she was somehow pregnant from yesterday. I knew squirt had super-semen in it and I didn’t know if maybe it accelerates the appearance of pregnancy symptoms but I realized that there’s no way it could move that fast and even if it could she would have a pregnant-style stomach and she didn’t. 

But my anxiety was raised again when she said she wanted me to “cream her pussy,” which again had me feeling conflicted because on the one hand I have been on my creampie wave (author note: he won’t tell you this because he doesn’t like bragging, but he is a certified lieutenant in the creampie-agree-er-with-of-beating-off-to community, several seasons running), but I also didn’t know if maybe I had actually intuited something earlier with pregnancy being an issue that I would need to concern myself with today, but this concern also quickly dissipated when I chose to believe her when she told me she was on birth control as a response to recognizing my hesitancy to her request. 

During what I call the sabbath period, the time after the release of ejaculate but your dick is still by definition hard because it hasn’t become soft again yet, Sofia claimed that “that was a big load,” which I think was mostly said to make me feel like The Man, but also it did feel like a bigger load than I usually produce, but I attributed that to Sofia’s encouragements, particularly as I thought I was reaching the finishline and she told me to “fully empty \[my\] balls” inside her strange, and also just the physical sensation of my stone in her gush. And despite hypothetically fully emptying my balls, when I incidentally (and by the grace of God) saw her fat ass when she got up to get her vape, I was compelled to ask if she will squirt in my mouth and in response she said, “if you cum in my mouth.” I admitted that her pussy might have just required my full supply on retainer, but she said if she feels a cock throbbing in any of her three classic holes, it gets her horny enough to convert the jizz filling any of those holes into squirt. She said that it was a myth that semen had to be swallowed to produce squirt. She said if you just think of any of my holes as a mouth pleading for a jizz-handout, squirt can be made.



**Winterhalter and Culianu**

	In a sense, former priest and current theologian–and between you and me, pay attention to his last name—he would seem destined for the cloth —I. Peddett Hymn offered an interesting take on the death of famed religious historian Ioan Petru Culianu, who was fatally shot in the back of the head in the bathroom of Swift Hall at the University of Chicago Divinity School just after noon on May 21, 1991. His murder was never solved, but many people have suggested the involvement of former members of the Securitate, the secret police agency of the at-the-time recently toppled Socialist Republic of Romania. 

Before being killed, he had published a number of articles and interviews that heavily criticized the [Ion Iliescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Iliescu) post-Revolution regime, making Culianu one of the government's most vocal adversaries. Several theories link his murder with the [Romanian Intelligence Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Intelligence_Service), which was widely perceived as the successor of the Securitate;  several pages of Culianu's Securitate files are inexplicably missing. Some reports suggest that Culianu had been threatened by anonymous phone calls in the days leading up to his killing.

Hymn noted that, for years, on each passing birthday, Culianu had received what could only be described as an excessively affectionate congratulatory letter signed only by ""Winterhalter,"" which always ended with ""you are a part of my dreams past, present, and future."" These missives had been arriving for almost ten years, bearing postmarks from a variety of locations from New York to Alaska to Germany and then reversing course, back to Illinois. But none of the envelopes ever bore a return address, and the signature, beneath a typed ""Winterhalter,"" struck no note of familiarity for Culianu. He reviewed his historical repository of class rolls and grade books, but never located a ""Winterhalter"" at any of the stops along a peripatetic academic career ranging from America to the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, various short-term stops in Indonesia and Burma, and on to Japan. Who was shadowing whom? The birthday cards were as apparently peripatetic as was the addressee. But ""Winterhalter” always managed to locate him on April 20. 

 ""Winterhalter,"" given its regular, cyclical reappearance in Culianu’s life, soon came to be regarded as part of a conspiracy. Having accumulated the usual number of professional enemies among former colleagues, he had begun to think that one of them was perhaps responsible, speaking and haunting him with a persistent yet untraceable text. Yet, no one else among his former or present colleagues would admit to receiving or generating such signals. Though directed as they were to whatever his current academic address, the epistles were replete with addressivity they were, or at least appeared to be, informed with his existential presence, no less than was he. Was ""Winterhalter"" a potential lover, a forgotten past lover, or an enemy sent to torment him by agents wishing for his death?

With the Reformation, the publication of Old and New Testaments in the vernacular, following Martin Luther's radical announcement of dissent nailed to a church door, diminished the monopoly of interpreters appointed by the Holy See or its representatives. Previously, as the Patrialogia Latina would attest, interpretation was in the hands of those in the apostolic succession or their appointed representatives upon whom learned hands had been laid, the Reformation launched a proliferation of highly individual and individuated interpretations of decentered divine signals emanating from an assortment of regimes. One result was a democracy of interpretation and re-narration, an institutional predecessor of the internet.

We heirs of radical Protestantism have acquired the ""habit of art,"" which, like the quest for truth in our interpretations, demands that we read nature not as nature at all, but rather as fragmentary ""evidence"" of personal salvation or damnation. To read the world as a ground of ""evidence"" is not to read nature-en-soi (nature-in-itself), to appropriate the French. We have come to read it in a rather certain kind of self-interested, highly analytical style that gave birth to the critic/sleuth and maintains me as a critic in work, deciphering plots. Because God's design was hidden, the gothic novel developed a collateral narrative and structural architecture, familiar to academics like Culianu who instruct students to read more ""deeply,"" creating of every text the architectural penetralium. Manuscripts hidden behind or within other manuscripts; secret messages from previous inhabitants of a supposedly private domain; permeable walls and gossamer separations by which what had appeared to be barriers become in effect channels of transmission; transparent vellums; and multiple narrators separable only by the distinctions between single and double quotation marks are all characteristics of a literary form perfectly appropriate to this ideology and style of ""reading.”

 Archontism is a current of thought that sees human existence as controlled by ‘archons,’ or agentified barriers built into the natural world in order to block the paths to psychic transcendence. In William S. Burroughs’ cosmology, humanity must defeat the archons to become immortal, but there is no savior figure beyond the stars. 



**Professional Breakdancer Will Not Allow His Fiance to Invite Her Robot Friend To Their Wedding Because He is Concerned that the Robot Will Be a Better Dancer Than Him**

“Aint having no robot dancing at my damn wedding!” said B-boy Victor, former member of the US Olympic Breakdancing Team, sternly to Deb, his fiance. She was pushing for her robot friend, Manny, to be allowed to attend the wedding. Victor hadn’t had a history of being prejudiced against robots (he helped L-Tron and Motherboard move in next door not even a year ago), but he for some reason was fervently against Manny attending. Victor had hacked Deb’s social media accounts for review only a couple days ago so he knew there was no funny business between her and Manny, but he did see in her history a YouTube link of a short by user ManDoesItWell called, “Playboi Carti - JUMPIN #dance #choreography varoom,” which featured a robot that looked like Manny, but Victor isn’t the type of guy to jump to conclusions. He did then see the same user’s video entitled, “Finnatryna - Your Girl is Mine #strokegang #robot #automon” and Victor could see he had skills.

	“No damn way this guy is coming to our wedding,” but somehow Manny made it to the dance floor at the wedding and did 143 headspins in 60 seconds, breaking B-Boy Aichi’s world record by one spin because Aichi ran his mouth in the press about robots not being real B-Boys. Manny changed the music like a TouchTunes to “Computer Love” by Zapp and remotely connected his movements to the second guy from the Kollaboration 2001 video from [ebaumsworld.com](http://ebaumsworld.com) and then to WC from the Up in Smoke tour DVD part where he cripwalks laterally across the stage and then he did some shit you’ve never seen and then he teleported back to the evening’s bouquet toss where he picked off the tossed bouquet, secured it like Griffey, and gave it to the hottest bridesmaid. 

You tell me what happened: only two days after the wedding, the hottest bridesmaid’s friends noted a slew of posters for Short Circuit, Short Circuit 2, and Bicentennial Man covering her apartment walls, and allegedly one friend saw, on the hottest bridesmaid’s phone, an AI-generated video of a breakdancing robot windmilling on her pussy, and straight up the friend said it didn’t seem like a short video. 



**Final, Threesome Ritual**

	Sofia, Narrator, and Caramel are standing in that order naked, staring at a sea of fluid covering the viewing screen, as Narrator runs the middle finger of each hand up and down the ass cracks of his two friends flanking each of his sides until he gets fully erect and then he looks over to each of his friends before he takes a seat in his LayZBoy. On his right, Caramel faces her ass toward Narrator, enacting her lordosis even more than usual, with the intention to hopefully increase the natural spreading of her cheeks to make her asshole more readily visible to Narrator, both to increase Narrator’s horniness and make it easier for Narrator to see the entire target his mouth was assigned to encapsulate, and while Narrator was making good on his affixture duties, Sofia had climbed on Narrator’s lap to manually insert his erection into her pussy as Caramel simultaneously inserted her finger into Sofia’s mouth that Sofia subsequently wrapped her lips around. 

They had intended to bust through the first set of loads quickly, to confirm the effectiveness of their design (Narrator in Sofia’s pussy and Caramel in Narrator’s mouth; Narrator in Sofia’s asshole and Caramel in Narrator’s mouth; and then Narrator in Sofia’s mouth (after Caramel removes her finger from Sofia’s mouth (and therefore returns the ability to squirt back to Sofia); Caramel expresses encouragements while Sofia sucks Narrator off as an expression of her horniess but also to have the load bust faster so she can return her finger to Sofia’s mouth to get back the squirt ability)) and Sofia outward toward (and hopefully on) the viewing screen. 

This all goes according to plan, with Sofia’s asshole shooting her squirtload onto the screen, and  as Caramel complimented how fucking fat her load was that she busted, the sea level of fluid portrayed on screen reduced.

Eventually, after many enactments of the cycle, the sea level of fluid was cleared but the screen was now covered in Sofia’s squirt. Watching her blow her loads, I did think about licking the screen clean (probably as a way to try to express to Sofia that I find her so attractive that I want to (and by virtue of doing it) would be willing to tongue clean off her jizz that has been creating a filter on my viewing screen (I would frame it as “the” viewing screen so that she didn’t think I was mad that she farted her cum on it)). Logistically, I couldn’t figure out a way for my tongue to stay affixed to Caramel and also be able to take in the squirt of someone else (I tried (many times) but I mostly just got squirt blown across the side of my face and not in my mouth mostly (my buddy got me this funny shirt while he was on vacation in Acapulco—”I Went to Study Forensic Science and All I Got was This Black Light Picture Showing that I Got Diarrheaed On Across My Face That Was Shared With My Entire Class and Even Though I Lied and Told Them It Was Not Diarrhea They Did Not Believe Me” T-shirt).

There is that fucked up lizard guy from the Ripley’s Believe It or Not show that somehow split his tongue so it looks like he has two tongues, and though I think that guy is fucked up, I happen to be in a situation where I could use having two tongues (I want to have it so I can have my tongue in both Caramel’s asshole and Sofia’s asshole at the same time in perpetuity) which is a statement I never thought I would hear myself say.

The following story is a tableau, told in the science fiction genre, of an alternate reality, in which the government has passed and enacted a law to attempt to deal with human vulnerability to the deceptions of deepfakes and other AI-generated imagery. The law states that, if all of the persons depicted in an AI-generated image or video (called “Aimages,” for shorthand) “hang” that Aimage in their own, respective Encrypted Accounts, then what is depicted in the Aimage is considered to be legally “real” (i.e.: to have “actually” happened or to  “actually” be happening), and society at large has accepted this. Society and law do recognize that the depicted events “really” happened, but not in our world, rather “real” in whatever virtual reality world the Aimage was created with.

Developed by various, major techcorps, in conjunction with US government departments identified as “Interested Parties,” Encrypted Accounts (EA) serve as “digital safes,” where users (i.e.: citizens) store important and sensitive information, such as social security numbers, digital birth certificates, bank records, digital family pictures, Aimages, etc. They are similar to social media profiles but are specifically designed to be nonpublic. These accounts are said to be unhackable and are insured. Each United States citizen is entitled to their own EA; it is just a matter of signing up, a process which they have made so simple it would be foolish not to set one up. The vast majority of citizens of the ensuing story’s world have set up their EAs. 

One of the features of EAs is the “Gallery,” which, just as the name suggests, looks like a digital art gallery, with white walls that have spaces to “hang” images/videos/Aimages (users are able to customize the look of their Gallery). When an Aimage is hung, an ovular icon appears on the white wall below it, called an Indicator, which turns a bright green when each of the subjects portrayed in the Aimage have also hung the same Aimage in their EA, indicating not only the Aimage’s legally “real” status but also the implication that each participant is wanting to (continue to) participate with the others performing whatever activity is being portrayed in the Aimage. 

Further, the government imposes a tax on these hung Aimages, which then naturally governs the amount of Aimages that are (and stay) hung. Not only does this limitation have the effect of maintaining the integrity of the “real” legal designation, but it helps to deal with the incredible amount of power required to keep these Aimages hung in the EAs (said to be several levels higher than what is required for mining Bitcoin, and even Titgroin), and also to curb the use of resources required to tax assess Aimages by the Department of Auditing.

We will look at how these policies were developed, and what such a world, in which humans and AI robots live together, may look like. The main narrative revolves around the generation of an Aimage involving our protagonist known only to us as Narrator and his escort neighbor, Caramel. 

However, a word to the reader: though portrayed in narrative form, as mentioned above, these scenes may be most appropriately considered as tableaus–-these are not works of criticism or satire but rather intended to evoke an impression or feeling about whatever-it-is that is being presented. As such, base language is used in order to most efficiently attempt to express that whatever-it-is.

This baseness is reflected in the logic of the story’s world. For example, the childish insult of calling someone or something “gay,” whether in the homophobic or just generally derisive sense, is in the story’s world not so much an insult but something holding serious rhetorical heft. In the story’s world, the term has been largely stripped of the nastiness it carries in our culture, instead denoting a general (unspecified) negative quality (and that which has been evaluated as such). Despite this “stripped” meaning in the story’s world, it is intentionally understood that (hopefully) the hypothetical reader would be reading it in this world’s “unstripped” context.

Another word (and perhaps warning) to the reader: this piece contains graphic sexual content. Sexual-drive motivates much of the action in the story, but in the story’s world this isn’t just perverts running amok. In our real-life world, sexual motivation is primarily related to pathos, whereas in the story’s world, it is primarily the story world’s ethos. The characters are speaking through these base, sexual acts and language; it may be useful to think of the characters’ actions as metaphors for the whatever-it-is mentioned above. 

Conceptually, what connects this baseness to the AI concerns mentioned above? It may revolve around the notion of the “real;” due to the tax constraints imposed to have an Aimage considered “real,” it is likely the only type of Aimages people would be willing to keep hung in their EAs would be those portraying enactments of great devotion, and at least in the story, these are of a religious or sexual nature. The motivations behind belief/faith and sexual impulses may be described as “base.” If, as represented in the story, the religious/sexual is “real” and also “base,” it may be deduced that the “base” is “real.”  

The story begins with a seemingly unrelated prelude, revolving around a real-life incident about Swedish twin sisters who came to national attention in the United Kingdom in May 2008 after an apparent episode of *folie a deux* (“shared psychosis”), when the twins ran across the M6 motorway, as captured by a small television crew. 



The main focus of this opening sequence is on an unnamed police officer’s experience on the scene, who is woken from a daydream and unsuccessfully restrains one of the twin sisters from running into traffic. Shortly thereafter he experiences an odd, phantom force physically pulling him by his testicles toward the accident site (the writer seems to be making a reference to pairs: the character’s “balls;’ the seemingly random paragraph noting embedded base*ball* references; the Swedish twins (possibly a reference to the Minnesota Twins baseball team–particularly because of the history of Swedish and Scandinavian immigration to that area)).

 Let us begin the story.



**Prelude**

 Ursula Eriksson, a Swedish tourist, ran into traffic on the M6 freeway in Britain, right into the side of a Mercedes Actros 2546 lorry. This was caught on not just CCTV but also the cameras for the television show, *Motorway Cops*, an English analogue to the American programme, *Cops*. 

Ursula received aid and survived; the interest here though is in the lorry. Its cargo wall had imprinted on it the 32ndth-inch outline of what would be a crazed Swedish woman’s face. This indent, too indistinct and unformed for friends or family to identify, didn’t miss Admiral Group’s Herman Waylight, an expert on lorry damage and claim spoilage assessment, and seemingly a giver-of-deal.

Yet one Motorway Cop possessed bold claims. 

Taken out from the clouds by Meechum Peenis and Craig Morjaggs’s sudden verbal commands to “get back!”, and sensing only the pitches of fellow officers in need of backup, he shook out of his daydream and instinctively moved toward attendance for support; he flew by all the other officers without thinking like a wave and just moments before her accident, he found himself here standing 2 to 1.65 meters closer to Ursula than the next nearest chaperone: he had just assigned himself the task of restraining what would surely prove to be a wriggling villain. 

During the physical struggle, he erred in judgment, yanking only a sandal out from the exchange and in so doing he freed her foot to spring her toward her journey through the overground railroad. In the sign of impact (the “strike zone” as it is called in the auto insurance field), he recognized her and now could not shake Ursula in the outline. “Fielding Urs-,” as he would later call it (he would see his balding—*out, out, and out it goes*—increase in pace starting around then basically), would make its presence here known to him (at least in, what he called, its “four sack,” or most developed, form).\*\*\*

Bill Stoneham, our man here, shares a name with an obscure American painter, who produced a work called, *The Hands Resist Him* (1972), notable for being known as being considered one of the most haunted paintings in the world. In Bill’s pocket was a sterling, whose ridges rubbed gently against a grocery receipt for glassware, cereal, pork, and liter bottles of mineral water, the latter of which stood in for the hose water, packaged in gallon jugs, he wished was commercially available. Stoneham noticed an odd pressure in his groin. 

“Get your hands out of your pocket,” Veronica passed by, doing her job, and he needed to do his job, and everything was occupied, and he stood there, his head, full of blood. Veronica knelt to attend to Sabina, Ursula’s twin sister, and who had in fact charged the freeway right before Ursula, and fortunately for Sabina, despite some nasty bruising and contusions, her round trip left her with no truly serious physical ailments. These Swedish sisters, as troubled as they seemed to be, were not insignificantly resilient, and he thought he felt compelled to write home to tell someone about these extraordinary women.

Veronica squatting near Sabina sent his hand from his coin, zippering briefly with his other hand on the front of his pants then abruptly finding home at his sides as if shocked. Now erect and mobile, Stoneham surveyed the scene and sought the spot to most appropriately unload his assistance.

Stoneham meant to see it for years, and now he was thinking about it. Tomorrow he wasn’t working, so maybe tomorrow was the time to do it, at least not now with this scene, the one sister Sabina had run into traffic again, but this time she made it across to the median. She’s standing basically still facing back toward the police officers halted temporarily by their efforts that seem to be retarding the vehicular flow impeding their own path to her, and her hand reposed upon the median, her other hand idly policing her leg that thigh from my angle probably not actually touching and it dangles thanks to the gravity and all things considered calm breathing, she’s still screaming and I have to consider what is going on. Bragging about an unaffectedness, I stopped considering what I saw as being inaccurately described as a “drone,” it was clearly more shrill in bursts.

That novel pressure in his groin area was growing. It was a particular sensation he hadn’t felt before, and because of all of the foregoing excitement with the Eriksson twins, he hadn’t had time to pinpoint exactly where this force was primarily honing in on. It was not in his penis, it was not in his taint, and, then, as soon as he thought, “gonads,” as if gripped, Stoneham is being led somewhere by his fucking nuts: “My fucking nuts….where are we going?” Being pulled along by his bag by some invisible apparition as if on one of those flat escalators at the airport, and despite being relatively agnostic to ball play, he felt this erogenous pressure was beginning to cause reflexive and unintentionally disrespectful thoughts about his friend’s sister’s weight serving as an appropriate test case for the load-bearing capacity of his face as a pedestal or a swing. 

(If this is a cute chick ghost guiding his sack along, even if a little more forceful than ideal, I feel like you can’t be that pissed if you are him, especially if this ghastly handler is a thick one or athletic-looking or an art-style chick or whatever it is that bewitches you.)

	It became clear it was pulling him toward the lorry’s indent. Earlier in the night, shortly after the accident, he thought about putting his face in that receptacle he felt was customized by and through his dereliction and a place he ultimately could not inhabit. In consolation, he laid the back of his head there, with his eyes closed he thought he was indicating a hopefully sufficient sense of guilt. Whether or not in response to this display, the ghost slammed him, balls-first, against the damaged lorry with such force that one of his testicles was crushed. In response to the sound of the crash against the lorry and Stoneham’s subsequent moans, Officer Peenis ran over to the site of the noise, where Stoneham indicated the location and nature of his gonadal injury. It was at this time that Peenis had conceived of the nickname, “Monad,” for Stoneham, but he wouldn’t start referring to him by that name to his face until he returned to work after recovery from his injuries (Coincidentally, Officer Morjaggs had devised a nickname for Stoneham, “Sackless,” earlier that same night, after Stoneham’s losing effort against Ursula—Morjaggs, like Peenis, respectfully waited until Stoneham returned to work from recovery before he started exclusively referring to him by the nickname).

What Stoneham had meant to see for years was Robert Smithson’s 1974 landmark piece, “Yo-yo,” a land art piece which sits only 72 miles from the site of the accident, on the shore of Moreton Bay on Moreton Beach in Merseyside, Borough of Wirrel, and, though smearing in an ongoing game of chicken with the bay’s adjusting water levels\*, it’s still visible enough to attract a fair amount of tourists who have been made aware that it is a work by a notable artist and is on the beach and doesn’t cost anything extra to view. Smithson, strongly opposed to the elitism he saw in the contemporary artworld, felt that everyone should be able to experience art and, in a sophisticated move, after a brief, uncontentious meeting with the local planning board, clarified that legal authority prohibited any current or future would-be impresario from charging to see the piece. 

\*This “smearing” may be seen as an example, or indication, of the “natural process of retainment,” a key concept to Smithson’s theory of “‘true art’” (the idea of correspondence between the processes of animate and inanimate matter)--it describes a “resistance against ‘phenomenal pressure’\*\*” (Smithson, 65). As an example, the subject artwork mentioned above, “Yo-yo,” “plays” an endless game of chicken with the tides of the bay; the artwork and water are not “playing” in the sense humans do, however if we continue this analogical strategy, we may see additional layers. Tides are almost wholly influenced by the movements and positionings of the moon. In classical mythology, the moon is typically associated with the feminine, and in contemporary times, the moon is commonly associated with “mooning,” the act of showing one’s butt. Given these connections, “bay’s tides” is not so far verbally from “bey’s (or babe’s) tits”. We may then see this “game of chicken” as a sort of ritual of endurance of undulating tits-and-ass for which the subject must not break.

\*\*Regarding the phrase “phenomenal pressure”: in the first published edition of Smithson’s essay he does not designate any quotation marks, writing “phenomenal pressure;” but the adjective, ‘phenomenal,’ (and I think he’s right) may suggest an *extraordinary* or *exceptional* “pressure;” in contrast to what he intended to indicate simply as *occurrent;* in subsequent editions he would put “phenomenal” in quotes, but this he thought seemed to have an opposite effect: the “pressure,” being ‘“phenomenal,”’ (e.g.: “‘phenomenal’ pressure” (Smithson 173, ed. 3-6)), suggested that he may have been suggesting that the pressure was actually ineffective or at least not as effective as advertised. He eventually landed on putting both words in quotations.

**1.)**

The building’s water butt, though more than half-full from the generous morning rain (and with scattered showers forecasted for the afternoon), is still now playing host, attending to the dripping stragglers still remaining and now slipping intermittently from the eave flashing and recently unclogged gutter. About a third or a fifth or so of those drops are landing on the ground well outside the container, and honestly the closest ones of those maybe tag the outside of its bottom exposed wooden panels with what is essentially humidity that no one would even give a shit about if you didn’t point it out. 

An audible crash inside influenced him to investigate what may have caused the crash by going inside toward where he thought where the crash may have originated, and it led him to the lobby where he saw Caramel with one side of a huge box of what he assumes is a widescreen in her hands and her dad with the other end of the box resting near his feet. He walked over to see if he could help, but they were already back on their journey carrying it up the stairs, thankfully her dad leading and she manning the back. 

He noticed some pieces of styrofoam that must have escaped from the downed box corner and knelt to pick them up. He could hear her faint grunts of struggle on the stairs and so he was there asking if he could help as he put his hands on her end of the box, and her hands slipped from it with a tandem cutoff, “it’s O(K)–”. She walked up the stairs behind him and her dad, and on her floor he swung out to make room so she could lead us to her room, he couldn’t see her ahead behind her dad defending the bow.

We got to her room and set down the widescreen box and her dad received some chirps and he said I had to “help her out with the TV I’ve got to take care of this” and he left not in a rush but she shut the door behind him and then she said she’d help me once she changed into something more comfortable, and while she went to her room I removed the thin and wide unit from the packaging and lifted it first on the dresser below where her current-and-soon-to-be-previous monitor was hanging, leaning it against the wall, and then unscrewed the old monitor from the mount but realized the new monitor was in the way, so I tightened the old monitor back in slightly and set the new monitor on the ground and then unscrewed the old monitor carefully from the mount and carried it not very far, setting it on the ground near the couch. I picked the new monitor back up to fit it in the same mount, where one side snapped in place and turned the monitor on, the other side didn’t snap in and the monitor said, “Almost,” so I jostled it a bit before hearing, “What a success,” and the full blue screen menu lit up even though I didn’t hear the other side snap in but I guess it must have. 

“Thank you!” Caramel said smiling toward me from her room with a hug in a wifebeater and dolphin shorts. “Want a drink?” she asked, I did watch her turn and walk toward the cabinet and bend over to pull the bottles out, I knew her cameras were seeing me do it and she knew I knew she knew. I asked for a glass of the Scotch that I always ask for that she deliberately forgot to grab and had to bend over again to pull out and I watched her do it. She knew I knew it was a sales pitch and her phone buzzed against a hard surface from her room and she let it buzz a few more times because she caught me looking at her butt one time and also one time she invited me over before I knew she told me she overheard me and a neighbor’s drunken evaluations of the female tenants’ looks while we were outside smoking cigs.

She came back from her room without her phone and grabbed a bottle of champagne from her refrigerator and started pouring a couple glasses, she asked, “What’s good?” I turned toward the screen to investigate the stock of apps and as soon as I saw some potential options, the menu suddenly changed with a  “Welcome, Caramel,” and I could now identify, even through this more innovative design interface, a more familiar set of choices from which we usually select. 

I was, I’d say, a regular patron of hers (both in real life and online), and there was no denying this dynamic. I forgot to check my pockets earlier because I just recently decided that I should keep my crypto invested instead of using it for payment, I reached in my right front pocket where I felt a receipt and some bullshit dust that I wasn’t looking for and checked my right ass pocket and then she giggled as I felt the rolled cash in my left.

But even knowing I am always willing to exchange, she walked a little closer and planted as if to clarify, exaggerating her lordosis and employing a slightly pigeon-toed stance, and I thought this was the appropriate moment to explain my idea and I told her the way she was standing made me think this was the appropriate moment to explain my idea (Narrator’s idea is to create a generative AI video of Caramel standing naked with him kneeling behind her with his tongue affixed to her asshole in perpetuity; he claims there is some poetic value in creating an AI-generated video of this), with the intention to keep her in that stance as I set the cash on the dresser beneath the widescreen and to give her body time to remember all its parts’ positions here (though the lordosis did end up being exactly what we wanted, we realized during production that the pigeon-toes were too suggestive of a vulnerability that would be more useful for a certain type of pornography but was ultimately not appropriate for our project (we also experimented with her in a wider, sturdy stance, with her ass pushed out in a more exaggerated, presenting manner, but we thought this posture seemed to indicate an active desire on her part to have her ass eaten—again, more suitable for pornography—-my constant boner during these tests attested to this, and we decided it would be necessary for me to keep clothes on for the shoot so I could “invisalign” (i.e: tucking my boner in my waistband for the purposes of making it not as visibly apparent))).

She agreed to it but was concerned she would lose a regular. I was honest with her and told her that I would probably beat off to it for a while but after breaking it in, the more poetic aspects will be able to sing more freely, and stroking your shit while eating the *real* thing could never be replaced.



**The History of the Development of the Law that Allowed Aimages to Be Considered Legally Real**

Generative media software, like Aimage Generator 3, uses machine learning, especially deep learning, to create or manipulate audio, images, video, and text in ways that simulate or fabricate reality. These systems rely heavily on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), transformers, or diffusion models to synthesize media that appears convincingly real. The ease of production and corresponding prevalence of Aimages, such as deepfakes, digital doubles, and text-to-image/video, have long been cultural discussion points. This material’s capacity for deception is part and parcel of its appeal and has certainly exacerbated our cynical attitude toward what we see and read online, where everything is by default considered to be fake and often deceitful, unless proven otherwise.

Interestingly, this has not led to general apathy but to an increased sensitivity toward issues of trust and betrayal. and there is no better example of this than the fallout from the Ida Leak, an infamous data breach from multi-platform accounts of the massively popular content streamer, Ida Gnoe, that indicated that the vast majority of material she had been releasing (for “dozens of months,” it was reported) on her Fansly account had been, in fact, AI-generated. 

Prior to the leak, Ida Gnoe (Christian name: Wifida Vergobagidov) was a hugely beloved figure online: she held the record for most received cum tributes of all time (and while undisclosed to the public, the NSA had performed several significant studies on online masturbation patterns, which revealed Ida as the subject having motivated not only the single highest number of ejaculations over the course of their multi-year set of studies but also the causer of the largest collective amount of jizz produced by volume attributed to a single individual during that same period—-while it seems like these categories should typically beget analogous results, this has not shown to bear out in the recent decades: the tributed-to subjects that are most commonly associated with higher-T’d men did note being not unimpressed with the collective weight of tribute produced during this period but did raise concerns about the declining jack numbers. One of the hottest tributed-to subjects and also her extremely hot friend and also her friend’s sister and also her own sister that are both honestly really hot and both have big or actually really big tits, and actually looking at this data right here, it actually appears that also all of her sister’s really hot friends that are also pawgs and also have tits, and, if I am reading this correctly, it looks like it actually says here that the entire Milk Brigade have declared that they are not impressed by the low jack numbers among high-T’s, and that the categories that indicate the overall and unique number of vaginas that high-T’s have entered during that time don’t even matter or impress them, and that guys that jack off and are low-t are actually cool and they would want to be their girlfriends.  

The Ida Leak prompted Liberal-Humanist congressman, Michael “Greasy” Greventreziou, to take action on deepfakes, and in a bi-partisan effort, working with Traditionalist Party congresswoman, Hot Whitetrash, they developed what would eventually become the Aimage/EA bill. Prior to their research, they both had thought that any Aimage should be required to embed a disclosure on screen if a piece of visual media is, in fact, AI-generated. Through their preliminary testing, using a mixture of Whitetrash’s authentic, pre-Congress OnlyFans and personal videos, and also Aimages of Whitetrash performing similar acts, and then affixing the AI disclosure to a random selection of these videos, they did determine the disclosure significantly affects the jackability of these videos. 

More importantly, however, they thought the labelling requirement might be a form of tacit encouragement for further production of fake erotic material (they thought about how the introduction of the Parental Advisory sticker on musical albums in the 1990’s actually encouraged intrigue for and sales of the labelled albums). Even if the AI disclosure label did not encourage further production of fake material, it didn’t dissuade the production nor consider the ethical concerns of Aimage production. As a Liberal-Humanist, Greasy wanted to masturbate to people, not robots. 

(Greasy had previously introduced a bill to outlaw the practice of tit-fakery—when Congressman Jugg Larger brought up Pamela Anderson as a counter to Greasy’s suggestion that fake tits have never made a positive impact on society and that nice ass fake tits simply don’t exist, Greasy thought this was dirty politics. He admitted that he could see if someone would choose to categorize Home Improvement Pamela Anderson or Baywatch Pam Anderson as having nice ass fake tits, but these examples are extremely rare. In a fairly sophisticated rhetorical move, he asked Congressman Larger to identify a single other nice-ass-fake-tits-haver that Greasy had actively chosen as a subject to masturbate to and where actual jizz had been produced in the last 2 years. Congressman Larger couldn’t come up with a single example).



One of our boys was actually talking with God:

	“God, why did you make thick cheeks so nice? Could you make them a little less nice? It would be nice to not have to think about them all the time.”

	“That is a fucking gay ass suggestion,” said God. “You are gay.”

	He said, “No, I am saying they are *too* nice.”

	And God said, “Your mom is too nice, She is sucking my shit way too good right now, And straight up I am going to blow a God-style load in her goddamn mouth once you stop yapping.”

	He replied, “You are gay.”



It wasn’t until one fateful night that Greasy had a change of heart about Aimages. He and Whitetrash’s research sessions typically had been conducted in the same hotel room, where they could verify each other’s reactions to the videos, but this session was occuring remotely over Zoom and so they were using the Genital Sensor System (an early version of the GSS that the Tax Assessors would use (this will be explored later in the text). Regarding the Genital Sensor System, males wrap a thin strap sensor around the thickest part of their flacid penis; female auditors insert a short, thin cylindrical sensor into their vagina—the sensors measure the hardness/wettness of its users. 

To get a baseline reading of the G-Sensors in response to Aimages, protocol instructed they view something they both know not to have happened in real life, so they generated an Aimage of a threesome with both of them and Whitetrash’s political rival, Social-Communist congresswoman, Vanessa Garcia-Flores, who had spent a large part of her first term fighting against allegations of being young, big-titted, and hot, just as Whitetrash had the previous year, and despite having diametrically opposite political views, for which both passionately advocated, Whitetrash begrudgingly admitted that Garcia-Flores likely, like herself, was possessed with a “really wet, tight pussy,” and when Greasy asked how she knew, Whitetrash said, “because women can sense these things.” 

While they observed the threesome Aimage, Greasy’s sensor did register what would have been some of the highest levels of hardness he would have registered throughout the entire research process had they been using the arousal readers from the start of their studies. It wasn’t just the content of the Aimage that aroused him (though, given how close AiWhitetrash’s wet, tight pussy, for example, resembles Whitetrash’s real-life wet, tight pussy, it didn’t seem like a stretch that Garcia-Flores’ real-life pussy was as wet and tight as AiGarcia-Flores’ appeared to be). 

Greasy gets particularly aroused by seeing the indicator on the GSS reader showing that Whitetrash is aroused (this is coupled with seeing her face on Zoom that reads the same but also can’t he see her playing with her pussy which he suspects she’s doing —this inspires what would eventually be the Aimage/EA bill).

Greasy, Whitetrash, and Garcia-Flores do end up having a threesome in real-life and Greasy thinks the generation of the Aimage threesome probably (“must have”) played a role in making it happen; this makes him believe that Aimages and the humanist perspective are not antithetical (i.e.: by generating Aimages, it “concretizes” or “snatches” events from the realm of infinite-potential-events; these events are put in the catalog of activities that can be decided to be enacted in real-life). 



**AiRitual**

	Narrator is looking at the Gallery in his EA and sees the playing thumbnail of the Nar/Caramel Aimage and the green Indicator lit below it. He starts masturbating as he makes the Aimage full screen. Narrator notes that he knows that he noted how convincingly realistic the Aimage was the first time he watched it, how it looks exactly like the reference footage, but AiNarrator and AiCaramel have been performing this ritual for much longer than practically possible for Narrator and Caramel to have performed (even if Narrator (and/or Caramel) wanted to try—sleep, eating, jobs, and other obligations would be factors that would make it virtually impossible to enact in real-life)). The slight movements of the AI subjects, the slightest changes in posture, are like the Narrator and Caramel in the reference footage, but the Aimage continues to generate novel slight movements. 

	He thought about the young woman he’d met, Sofia, who he had met for coffee, where he explained the concept more fully to her and she was at first enthusiastic to work on it but kind of cooled on it it seemed, and his sense was that she wasn’t that into the idea itself, just wanted to work with a real artist, but she moved away, and he thought it was an amazing, conceptual piece. He would have done it in a second.

“What? No, that’s a lie. I was totally into the idea. And I told him that. We even developed the concept, like some really cool shit. It wasn’t until I mentioned I was getting into tarot that I could tell he started getting turned off, which I’ve had other men also show a similar disdain toward it because they see it in the same category as astrology (which I mostly don’t think is real). I would have done it, on the spot. I didn’t see him after those times we met in the coffee shop (especially the last one), and then I moved to Venice, and the art scene is crazy here.

1li7hug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1li7hug/aitah_for_shouting_at_my_fiancé_and_his_friend/,AITAH for shouting at my fiancé and his friend during our camping trip after feeling disrespected by their behavior?,"I (33 F) recently returned from a 3-day camping trip with my fiancé (41 M), my son, my best friend (31 F), my mom and her friend (mid-50s). To give some context, my fiancé is a former chef and avid outdoorsman who tends to take the lead in outdoor activities, while my mom is more passive and introverted, but agreed to stay behind and cook for the group.

Here’s where the trouble started: When we began planning meals for the trip, my fiancé kept interjecting, turning down ideas and saying my mom was trying to bring too much food. While I do agree to an extent, we ignored him because he made it clear he’d be out on the lake with his friend most of the time, so the rest of us were planning for meals that we could enjoy at the campsite in their absence. My mom tends to cook a lot (we’re talking 2 lbs of food per meal), but we figured that was perfect for a group of our size. We did have to waste some, but the intention was good and useful on high activity days in the summer heat.

We also had issues with parking when we arrived at the campsite. I had called ahead to confirm the parking situation, but when I got there, I was told I had to pay a $30 daily fee for my car. I was frustrated, especially since my fiancé had reassured me this would be a non-issue, but I eventually worked through it and had to unload a car that was packed to the brim with food, gear, and my friend’s belongings. I was growing increasingly frustrated as I saw that the car my fiancé traveled in had so much less than mine. I expected an equal distribution and felt like  our comfort on the trip was ignored to appease his fishing partner who drives a Lexus. After a grocery pickup, our ride up the mountain had no open space. Every spot was filled.

When we set up camp, it quickly became clear that my fiancé and his friend hadn’t planned for how close the tents were to one another. My fiancé is ex-military and should know that people don’t want to be packed in like sardines, but he set them up side-by-side, leaving no privacy or space for anyone to be comfortable. I let that slide and got to work organizing the campsite and setting up camp chairs and food. My fiancé and his friend left to go fishing, which helped the mood a lot. I needed a project to focus on and calm down.

That night, my fiancé was upset that I didn’t want to sleep with him right away. We usually don’t sleep together due to different schedules and me being a light sleeper, but he seemed upset by declining to join him. I stayed by the fire with my friend and didn’t go to bed until later. He flapjacked around the air mattress in our tent for 20 minutes before dozing off. It would have been no good for my rest to be there.

The next day, things took another turn when my fiancé mishandled an inflatable kayak I’d bought for him as a birthday gift. He and his friend shoved it against the car, which damaged it. I was really hurt by that, especially since money was tight for me, and I had worked hard to get it for him. I ended up calling them both ""idiots"" because I couldn’t believe they’d treat something so fragile with such disregard.

After that, we went swimming for hours and were invited to join the boys on a boat trip that turned out to be a disaster. We were in a tiny boat that felt unsafe due to high winds and choppy water, and it took several requests for my fiancé to slow down the boat so we could feel safe. My friend and I grew up around water sports and boats, if we weren't comfortable it was for good reason. We weren't on a barge, or even a pontoon, it was a dingy motor boat that could be relatives with a Planter's peanut can. When we got back to camp, my mom had prepared a huge meal, but my fiancé and his friend didn’t eat much and ended up wasting a lot of food. They seemed more focused on drinking beer and leaving trash everywhere.

My friend and I are experienced campers, so we were really annoyed by the littering and made multiple requests for them to clean up after themselves, but they didn’t seem to care. I follow a strict no trace rule and do not tolerate littering around me. It is one of the pillars of who I am ethically. When it came time to break camp, my fiancé got frustrated because he thought people were being lazy sitting around camp. I had already done a lot of the heavy lifting, but had help so I had no patience left for his attitude. He and his friend woke up last and were throwing a blind accusation. He snapped at the group but meant to target my mom in that statement about washing some pans, even though she’d already done a lot of cooking and catering for the group. I yelled at him in response, telling him he was being disrespectful, and things got heated. My mom ended up leaving the campsite in tears, and my son, who has autism, started getting upset too. My mom left one pan unwashed as they fried catfish they caught on the lake. The two other pans we had were on the stove with breakfast she had just cooked. One pan with pancakes, the other with eggs. We ran out of plates and left them there to serve ourselves buffet style in a coffee cup or a plastic lid of tupperware. We all made do without complaints, but he snapped with no understanding of what camp was before he woke. Instead of asking tenderly or considerately of his future mother in law, he kept saying ""this is absurd"" and bringing the mood of everyone down.

After all this, I spent some time talking to my mom and my friend, both expressing my concerns about my relationship. I’m wondering if I overreacted. I did a lot of the physical labor on the trip (setting up camp, cleaning, and breaking down camp), and I don’t think it’s fair that my fiancé and his friend treated my mom like a maid. He also disrespected my kayak, didn’t take safety seriously on the boat, and let things get out of hand with their littering.

I’m at a point where I’m seriously considering ending my engagement because of how things went down. My fiancé feels that my mom’s friend should’ve helped with the breakdown, but I don’t think she should’ve had to since she was the only one who slept in her car both nights. My friend has a bad shoulder injury so I wouldn't have elected them to do the physical labor.

Am I the asshole for shouting at them? Did I do something wrong? AITAH for feeling like the weight of this trip and these issues could be a dealbreaker for my relationship? I should be unpacking, but instead I am here, disgruntled and my peace disturbed over the blatant lack of consideration. I will be active in the comments if you have any questions for me.

I understand that in order to be in a secure relationship, I need to be a secure, non-needy person myself.

I used to have terrible anxiety with women, because on an unconscious level, I saw it like a performance. Whenever I sensed a spark or met someone attractive, I’d just forget about it and later regret not doing anything.

I’ve since practiced becoming less invested in what people think of me, and being comfortable in my own skin.

For the first time, I actually went up to someone and chatted with her. Not from a cheesy place of “picking up” but simply curiosity, and wanting to know who they are as a human being. 

After chatting for a bit I told her something like “hey this might sound a bit random but I honestly find you attractive. I’d love to get to know you more over coffee if you’re up for it.”

Unfortunately, she said no, she wasn’t in the right headspace for it. She did say that I seemed like a “really thoughtful, genuine person”. 

I told her it’s completely understandable and wished her well.

Not gonna lie, it did sting quite a bit. Because I was quite hopeful it might go somewhere. 

It made me think though, is it possible that the universe is preparing me to be the person I’d need to be, in order for my potential to manifest? 

Is it possible that the girl might not be the match the universe has in store for me, but this rejection is teaching me to let go of my old anxiety-ridden reality — and to slowly embrace my new one, where I’m comfortable opening up and being vulnerable? So when my potential does finally manifest, I’m not “pretend” ready, but “truly” ready?

Anyways, sorry for this ramble. I’m mostly thinking out loud.

Did anyone else find this book coming from an EXTREMELY privileged POV? Where are the stories about how to live sober when work sucks and you can't skip it? What about when you don't get to see your kids or family? Who the fuck has money and time for an artists' retreat in the woods? Who among us is actually waking up hungover to do their makeup and hair in a robe and then drive the kids to camp? I'm lucky to brush my teeth every day and get to work in a blazer. One of the authors talks about renting a $3,000.00 Oscar de la Renta gown and not liking it. Who is supposed to relate to this book?

Does this book get better? I REALLY like the core premise of it, but I'm cringing at every page. I don't want to downplay anyone's recovery story, but recovery sounds a lot easier when you're rich and have a ton of leisure time.

Tell me I'm wrong because I want to like this book. I just so far have found 0% of it relatable at all.

Edit: I promise I'm not trying to be an asshole. I really like the prose in a lot of this book and I've even been highlighting and annotating where it's helpful. I'm not getting NOTHING out of it, I just don't find it very helpful. I find the authors' descriptions of addiction and what they want for their lives to be relatable, just not how they arrived at sobriety or the tools to get there. 

The latter portion of the book is recipes which is great, but it's like for tea and bath bombs. To present myself in metaphorical comparison, I drink black coffee and take showers.
