I‚Äôve been a barista na in this company for 6 months and I started sa pagiging part-time hire, i worked sa different branch first and then nilipat lang sa branch ko currently where ako tinanggal randomly without notice, reason kasi kaya ko nilipat sa different branch is lahat ng part-time hire that time sa first branch ko (including me) ay willing i-absorb ng manager ko dahil maganda performance namin lahat, it‚Äôs just that dalawa lang yung budget ng store na ma i-hire and nag base na lang manager ko kung sino mga nauna ma hire eh yun yung i-a-absorb sa branch, hindi ako kasama ron dahil last ako nag apply pero inofferan pa rin ako ng manager ko sa different branch which tinanggap ko kaya ako nalipat sa branch na to.

first week ko pa lang sa branch na to i felt different na, it‚Äôs bad. how my coworkers there treat me and somehow the ppl who manages the store there. umabot sa point na need ko umabset two days straight sa sobrang shit nila ako i treat, it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want me there. so ayun after weeks, kinausap ako ng manager ko sa current store ko na bumaba na raw yung paper ko for regularization and hindi raw ito ma p-process ng manager ko dahil sa performance ko sa work lately, so binigyan nya ko ng another week to do my best (which is im trying naman) also it doesn‚Äôt make sense lang din for me yung feedback nya sa performance ko, i understand na may adjustment pa ko pero tinake ko pa rin feedback and i tried to be better pa rin to the point na even mga ka work ko is binibigyan na ko ng random praise and say about my improvement sa performance ko, and i really did best talaga. 

so ito na nga, kanina lang na seat-in ako ng isang supervisor don saying na due to performance issues, i still didn‚Äôt met their expectations so it‚Äôs gonna be my last day. ayun lang summary nya and sobrang straightforward (which wala sakin problema) ang hindi ko lang ma gets is hindi at never sakin ininform na if hindi ko mamemet performance requirements nila is matatanggal ako. sobrang random lang ng pag sabi sakin na it‚Äôs gonna be my last day and also sad kasi i really did my best and hindi lang ako nakakapansin non, kahit nga workmates ko. 

dahil hindi ako satisfied sa seat-in namin ng isang supervisor don, i decided to call the manager itself, may reason naman daw bakit di sya yung nag balita sakin ng news dahil sobrang busy nga nya and based sa kanya, mag e-end na raw contract ko this coming march 15 that‚Äôs why last day ko na bukas, so in-short, i am still a part time and hindi totally na absorbed all these time which is taliwas sa sabe ng previous manager ko, also hindi ko raw ba alam yung contract na pinirmahan ko na it‚Äôs just mere extension which i never recall signing one na about extension sa specific date, like wala ako pinipirmahan na extension, the only letter na pinirmahan ko at pinasa nung nasa previous store pa ko is letter of resignation sa pagiging part time at letter of application sa pagiging full time, hinihingi ko yung contract saying that since ayon nga raw nakita ng manager ko, also reason nya rin is dahil nga sa performance ko kaya subject ako for losing my job which is hindi naman minention ng current manager ko na pwede pala maging reason yun para matanggal ako sa work, never nag ka notice about it, just today.

SO GUYS HELP ME

valid at may laban ba ko mag file ng complain sa DOLE knowing na sobrang abrupt ako tanggalin sa work like wala man lang notice or what? afaik it‚Äôs considered illegal whether unjust or valid reason ng company tanggalin ang isang employee, IT SHOULD HAVE ATLEAST 30 DAYS NOTICE. 

PLS HELP HOW CAN I FILE SA DOLE IF EVER",1,1741968183.0,AntiworkPH,1,1.0,False

I recently used Bialetti's 12 cup moka pot to batch out coffee at a bar and it was a major hit. It can make about 20oz in ten minutes, which can be served as five 4oz cups, adding water or milk, which is probably more servings/minute than a single group head espresso machine. The extra strength works really well for cocktails. I feel like two of those could support a small volume bar/restaurant but might be cumbersome with high demand.

1jb72zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jb72zt/aio_for_wanting_to_end_contact/,AIO for wanting to end contact,"I‚Äôm going to apologize in advance for my terrible grammar and hope it‚Äôs still understandable. 

This story requires context. So just over 10 years ago my aunt (38 at the time) met a man (45 at the time). I was 15 almost 16. I‚Äôve always had a large chest (36DDD), and everyone always commented on it, like middle aged coworkers at a kitchen I worked at at the time called me ‚Äútits‚Äù as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. I digress, I‚Äôd ignored the comments as much as possible. 

Anyways, we were very close with my aunt and cousins, we always spent as much time with them as possible cause they were the same age as me and my brother. 

The first time I met this man he said ‚Äúyou must be *** cause you have huge tits‚Äù I was baffled I just shrugged it off and said yea because I had no idea what to say. My immediate family was kinda surprised too but I think we were all so caught off guard, nobody said anything. 

This kept going though, he would casually throw it into conversation every so often when we saw him (wasn‚Äôt too often as they were in the honeymoon phase of dating). My aunt shrugged this off as ‚Äúoh we talk like that at home too, he says stuff like that about my girls‚Äù. Mind you my entire family is very body conscious so they do make comments about each other, it‚Äôs not a process I enjoy or take part in. But I guess she allowed him to take part in this in their household.

Fast forward a few months, at their wedding. I‚Äôll admit I got a little carried away, I drank a little too much and was past my limit. I ended up crawling on the floor because I was too drunk. As I was crawling through their house I saw him standing there with no shirt so I made a comment like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not wearing a shirt‚Äù because I remember feeling gross about it. He came back with a ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre not wearing a bra‚Äù which I was, so I said ‚Äúyes I am!‚Äù and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äù. There were no other interactions with him. Eventually we went back to our hotel because they needed to put me to bed. 

The next morning is where things unfolded because we were outside on the deck having coffee when he brought up the fact that I wasn‚Äôt wearing a bra the night before, at this point my father had had enough. He didn‚Äôt want to ruin this relationship for my mom and for us kids, because we were very close but enough was enough. My dad started yelling at him saying things like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough already, there‚Äôs no need for you to be talking about her body all the time she‚Äôs 16‚Äù. When this was poorly received, they thought my father was overreacting, we left immediately. 

They ended up getting divorced 3 years ago. 

Fast forward to recently, I have been more recently (last 2 years) in touch with one of my cousins. We were on a trip and drinking a bit one night. I don‚Äôt know how the topic was brought up but essentially she blames me for being drunk and ‚Äúnot wearing a bra‚Äù which I was, saying that I took it too far and basically caused all these issues between our family. My partner, who I believe has a firmer grip on reality, stated that I was young and it was good I had someone to stand up for me. This set my cousin off and she firmly states she knows the whole story because she saw how drunk I was. Mind you she wasn‚Äôt in the vicinity the day after when the ‚Äúfight‚Äù, if you can even call it that, happened. But she‚Äôs still firm on the fact that this is all my doing because of how drunk I got.

This is honestly something that‚Äôs making me question maintaining contact. There was no success trying to tell her it was series of events rather than one event. It‚Äôs not just this either, she‚Äôs always trying to villainize me. Like I wasn‚Äôt feeling to great about myself one day (bloated from my period), and she turned it around saying I was basically calling her fat and stuff cause she weighs more than me? (I am also overweight). It‚Äôs getting a little tiring. Please tell me if I‚Äôm making a bigger deal than I need to about this.

Tdlr. My temporary (uncle in law?) had been making comments about my body since I met him at 15/16. Til eventually my dad had enough and yelled at him. My cousin blames me for being drunk.",1,1741967420.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1jb70e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1jb70e8/feeling_overwhelmed_and_frustrated_advice_please/,Feeling Overwhelmed and Frustrated - Advice Please!,"Hi everyone,

So, I've had an ongoing saga for many years now, and I'm starting to feel frustrated by my situation again. For context, I'm asthmatic (supposedly from childhood), 29, male, 5ft 8', and I weight about 80kg. I have also suffered with anxiety for many years, but I wouldn't say it actively affects me on a daily basis, but it can definitely flare up and affect me. I have a deviated septum (severely on one side which prevents breathing totally from the RHS unless at night when a nasal strip is worn, and give me about 20-30% airflow from that side) and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnoea. 

Let me try to summarise my situation and some of my symptoms... For the last 7 or 8 years, I've ALWAYS struggled with any form of cardio exercise. I CAN do cardio if I take a puff of my blue inhaler, but I tend to find that even after a light cardio session (e.g. badminton for an hour or introductory sessions of couch to 5K), I feel quite weak, shaky, and often have air hunger for the rest of the evening. For example, today, I walked into town (about 15 minutes) at a relatively fast pace, and found once I got to the coffee shop, I felt tired, out of breath and shaky (I am recovering from a cold, but still). I also suffer with air hunger quite a lot in my daily life (at the moment every day), but do find that it tends to improve if I'm less anxious - so there could be a link there. Just to provide another example, if I go from stationary and sprint for 5/6 seconds, I often feel spacey and dizzy afterwards for a short time period, and can also feel quite breathless for a while. I'm just fed up of not feeling like a normal human (e.g. can exercise freely, doesn't suffer with air hunger). 

I've also noticed, and I'm not sure if it's related, but I sweat A LOT. If I'm feeling a bit anxious, I can easily sit in a chair for 15 minutes and my armpits are soaking at the end of it. I also struggle in hot environments (e.g. I was in a sauna a few years ago and had to vacate because I felt like I was going to pass out). 

I've had lots of tests... I've had ECGs (which often show elevated heart rate that is typically attributed to anxiety on the day but no abnormal rhythms), an echocardiogram that came back all clear, blood tests (which showed a borderline iron level which I've now worked on correcting), and a 24 hour Holter monitor (which showed no abnormal tachy or brady rhythms but did note that I may be suffering from ""symptomatic sinus tachycardia"").

I don't seem to have the stereotypical ""heart rate stays above 100 after standing"", but my heart rate can easily go from 65-70 sat down, to about 100 after standing up, but I find that it will return to a lower rate a minute or two later.

Could I have an autonomic nervous system disorder? Could it be POTS? Could it be completely anxiety? I'm just lost and frustrated!",1,1741967233.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

1jb6yhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagoapartments/comments/1jb6yhh/little_village_by_california/,Little Village by California,"Hello everyone! Me and my boyfriend have been looking to move under some unfortunate circumstances, but also have been careful and reasonably picky. We found a nice place in Little Village off Sacramento in between Cermak and 23rd. If I took the L or bus it would be California pink line or 21 bus. We are currently in Pilsen, and I‚Äôve been to Little Village quite a bit and don‚Äôt feel like the safety level is too different. From what I‚Äôve read the spot we are looking at seems to have a consensus of being pretty quiet. 

However, my family (suburban but my dad grew up low income and my mom working class) is pretty skeeved out by the area. I know it‚Äôs not the greatest area, but I also know it‚Äôs not some place to be as concerned about as Englewood, North Lawndale, Garfield Park, South Shore etc. The level of fear and concern, while I do know it‚Äôs out of care for my safety, feels blown out of proportion. I do understand Little Village is gang territory and has some shootings, but the same things apply to Pilsen. Though with Pilsen I understand the gentrification probably slows it down a bit. But currently me and my boyfriend are by a bar that had to be closed down because it was deemed a public safety hazard üò≠

I would love input on people who live in or are familiar with the area. The place is nice and a great deal. I really like it‚Äôs by a coffee shop, elementary school and the park off Marshall. Are my parents too skeeved out or am I not keen enough on my own safety? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being obtuse but who knows.",0,1741967094.0,chicagoapartments,0,0.5,False

A bit of a predicament here. My gf and I of \~5 months were having a good morning, catching up and talking, having coffee as usual. All of the sudden, she picks up my phone and asks if she can go through it. She had it unlocked at this point, so I already felt uncomfortable. We've had a situation like this in the past where I gave her my phone to edit a note in the Notes app, and then used that to go through all of my other notes. After that, I got a bit upset and we had a mature conversation about it, and that was that.  However, I had said no this morning and respectfully said that there is an aspect of privacy/respect there for me and that I would have no reason to voluntarily go through her phone because I trust her. She immediately got upset and brought up her past relationship worries (he was hiding many things on his phone that ended up compromising the entire relationship). She thinks that I'm invalidating her past concerns by saying no about the phone (which she has told me about previously) but I think I have a right to some privacy and that she should respect that boundary. That said I do feel bad now hearing how she feels upset/invalidated about the past, so I'm very conflicted on what to do. Any advice on how to resolve the conflict given her past worries, has anyone gone through a similar situation? Thanks!",1,1741966575.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False
1jb6qrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/1jb6qrq/top_stories_impacting_global_supply_chains_mar/,"Top Stories Impacting Global Supply Chains: Mar 8-14, 2025","Happy Friday Folks,

Here are the top 10 stories impacting global trade and logistics this week:

**US-Canada Trade War Begins**  
Ontario announced a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota, and New York but quickly reversed the decision after President Trump threatened to double existing tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel. Canada had already imposed C$29.8 billion in retaliatory tariffs, including C$12.6 billion on U.S. steel and C$3 billion on aluminum. Trump also demanded that Canada remove tariffs on U.S. dairy products, calling them ""Anti-American Farmer Tariffs.""

**EU Imposes Retaliatory Tariffs on U.S. Goods**  
The European Union will impose tariffs on ‚Ç¨26 billion ($28 billion) worth of U.S. products, including steel, aluminum, agricultural goods, motorcycles, and bourbon whiskey. The tariffs will roll out in two phases, starting with levies of up to 50% on April 1. In response, President Trump has threatened 200% tariffs on European wine and champagne if the EU does not back down.

**China Slaps Tariffs on U.S. Agricultural Products**  
China has hit U.S. agricultural exports with 15% tariffs on chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, and 10% tariffs on soybeans, pork, beef, and dairy. China, the largest buyer of U.S. farm goods, purchased $29.25 billion worth of American agricultural products in 2024. Analysts say Beijing is deliberately targeting Trump‚Äôs core voter base in farming states.

**CMA CGM Commits $20 Billion to U.S. Maritime & Logistics**  
French shipping giant CMA CGM will invest $20 billion to expand its U.S.-flagged fleet, enhance port infrastructure in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, and Miami, and establish a logistics R&D center in Boston. The investment aligns with U.S. efforts to reduce reliance on foreign shipping and revitalize domestic shipbuilding.

**Walmart Caught in U.S.-China Trade War**  
Walmart is facing scrutiny in China after allegedly pressuring suppliers to lower prices to offset rising U.S. tariffs. Chinese officials summoned Walmart executives, warning that such demands could trigger further regulatory action. Walmart reportedly asked suppliers for discounts of up to 10% following Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports.

**GE Aerospace to Invest $1 Billion in U.S. Factories**  
GE Aerospace is doubling its investment in U.S. manufacturing, committing $1 billion in 2025 to boost aircraft engine production. The investment will expand manufacturing capacity, improve supply chain resilience, and create 5,000 new jobs.

**Trump's Tariff Uncertainty Fuels Front-Loading at U.S. Ports**  
U.S. container volumes surged in early 2025 as businesses rushed to import goods ahead of escalating tariffs. The Port of Los Angeles recorded its busiest start in 117 years, with U.S. ports handling 4.3 million TEUs in the first two months‚Äîan 11% increase from last year. However, Chinese export growth has slowed, and freight rates have dropped, suggesting that front-loading may soon taper off.

**Cocoa and Coffee Markets Face Cash Crunch Amid Record Prices**  
Cocoa futures hit an all-time high of $12,906 per metric ton in late 2024 before dropping 28% in early 2025, while coffee futures surged 20% in 2025 following a 70% rise last year. Hershey and other chocolate makers warn that extreme price volatility is distorting supply chains.

**Hudson‚Äôs Bay Files for Bankruptcy**  
Canada‚Äôs oldest retailer, Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, has filed for creditor protection, citing post-pandemic retail struggles and trade war impacts. The company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th in Canada, faces a liquidity crisis, with liabilities exceeding assets.

**Dollar General Reports Sales Growth but Plans Store Closures**  
Dollar General posted 1.2% same-store sales growth in Q4, but customer traffic declined by 1.1% due to financial pressures on low-income shoppers. The retailer will close 96 Dollar General stores and 45 Popshelf locations while converting six Popshelf stores into Dollar General outlets.

I (30F) started attending a therapy group last year at my local women‚Äôs community organisation; its aims to support women who have been victims of DV and Sexual Abuse. My case is really intense (SA) and I barely escaped with my life so I‚Äôd prefer not dive into those details. Also relevant is that I am a medical clinical in the ED.

All was great until end of last year when a newcomer (F27) joined the group. She seemed fine at first. She was very open about having BPD and a few other psyche issues.
Very charismatic but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I found her pushy and weird at times but let it fly because I already had my ‚Äúpeople‚Äù from the OG members and she said she had Autism. I also have high functioning ASD.

One day she came to group really distressed because her friends (who she has been telling us in previous weeks she had been going ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù to support through a MH crisis) had suddenly turned on her and sent some really horrific messages. The group supported her and were vocal critics of her friends.

After the group that night I saw she posted online that she was in the ED I had worked in because she had self-harmed. I reached out to ask her if she needed anything.

Next week she came to group and wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how much that had meant to her. I was glad I guess, but also: it was a basic decent thing to do. Anyway, since she kept saying how ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù having no friends was making her feel, a bunch of the girls offered to go for coffee with her. Not long after she set up a coffee date with me.

After that the friendship moved‚Ä¶ really quickly. In hindsight I was getting loved bombed but slow to call it was it was because it was a female and a platonic relationship. 

*What‚Äôs Happened*

A few months in and the mask has finally dropped. I‚Äôve seen her through a meltdown before and was accustomed to the walking on eggshells part, glasses being thrown, no apologies issued and her family just pretending it didn‚Äôt happen. But this was different. She lost her shite over something, projected it into me and became physically violent. I retreated but she kept escalating so I left the room we were staying in. Didn‚Äôt shout, fight back - I just left. 

The next morning when she asked where I was as we were due to leave (returning home on vacation - she had basically invited herself and then another of her family members had too FML) I explained I felt some space was best so I wouldn‚Äôt be going with her to the airport. Staff had wanted to throw her out but I‚Äôd convinced them to let me check into a new room and she‚Äôd settle without an audience. $260 for the room but they did upgrade me free because they were so sorry for me (they could hear her shouting all the way down the lobby).

She then promptly checked out of our OG room (staff had helped me book another due to safety concerns) and charged EVERYTHING to my card. $2,000. Staff were so apologetic when it was discovered and informed me I could report it as fraud. 

Since returning she‚Äôs been demanding money she isn‚Äôt owed. I understand she‚Äôs heightened so took advice from the counsellors from the service to block her (she was sending vile message saying I had deserved to be raped) to give her time to cool off as she was just abusing the communication channel but demanding she wanted the money addressed‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt do that if we can‚Äôt talk because she‚Äôs being abusive. It didn‚Äôt work and the silence caused her to escalate during a group session recently. She started threatening to come to my house and implied harm to my elderly parents. I was offered mediation by the service (yeah‚Ä¶) but after being told she wasn‚Äôt interested in apologising I passed on the opportunity. It seemed pointless and only harmful. I explained again on Tuesday this week to staff that I felt uncomfortable with a 1:1 and I didn‚Äôt not want to be put in that situation, as I was scared but also scared I‚Äôd lose my shit at her (she‚Äôd been threatening to come to my house, extorting money from me and causing chaos. Note: I am already on a suicide safety plan, and the anniversary of my assault just passed, and I‚Äôm staring down the barrel of potential cervical cancer thanks to my 
rapist, among A LOT of others things. I don‚Äôt have time for her shit which is a view endorsed by my solo counsellor at the service). 

We were attempting to get through another session. It wasn‚Äôt going great. During ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù she used her time to tell a long story about a ‚Äòformer friend‚Äô she had contacted a lawyer about and just pretty much used the session to intimidate me that she‚Äôs going to cause hell. She won‚Äôt win a court case (she OWES me money but is too erratic to process that) but I also don‚Äôt need the drama right now; I‚Äôm barely holding on. She‚Äôs also going on about she‚Äôs spoke to the head of the organisation who agreed with her on how abusive her friend has been for leaving her in the room alone (no mention of the shoes being thrown) and yada yada yada

Anyway, end of session, group Facilatator wants to talk to me so I leave, walk into the hallway and: there‚Äôs the girl. It was a complete trick to get me to speak to her. It didn‚Äôt go down well, I was literally backed into a corner. I felt ambushed. She presented me a sealed envelope and told me it was ‚Äúpretty self explanatory‚Äù. I refused to accept it, assuming it was a legal letter. White envelope with my name and the date on the front. Nothing self explanatory about it. Facilitator informed me it wasn‚Äôt. But no one has told me what it IS. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs been screened. I tried to explain that I am open to resolution but felt this was inappropriate and far from ‚Äúself explanatory‚Äù but got sorta dismissed by the Facilatator. Took the letter (unopened), returned to room, and heard the girl carrying on outside. So she got what she wanted: she used the service to put me on the spot and then when I reacted the way I feel most people would react (I didn‚Äôt swear, I just said I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable, I wasn‚Äôt going to accept her letter without context etcetera and that probably came across as frosty) she used that to play the victim.

I‚Äôm realising I may have to leave my support group which sucks. They aren‚Äôt doing anything to rein her in. She‚Äôs co-opting a part of the group format to be intimidating and disrespectful. I had hoped to not invole them (I had to inform them that she had assaulted me, but just wanted to continue on with the group business as usual). But she‚Äôs now using the counsellors for her games. They keep falling back on that fact she‚Äôs ‚Äúunwell‚Äù - but so am I. It‚Äôs driving a wedge between me and the service. I‚Äôm also dealing with rape trauma and police trails, stalking from my perpetrator and a lot of workplace reprisal for reporting the assault. So lots more objectively. She was grabbed and kissed by a guy a few years ago, who was arrested, charged and convicted. So we‚Äôre not ‚Äúequal‚Äù in terms of vulnerability right now. 

What should I do. The service seems to be supporting her way more than me. They crossed my boundaries in favour of hers today. It felt really unsafe, not to be a princess about it. She‚Äôs already spoken to the boss of the service and it sounds like this girl has filled her head with a bunch of bullshit - if it‚Äôs true. 

I have never raise what she did to me in check in because I‚Äôm trying to keep it classy for me + the others. Plus Little BPDer would likely lose her shite and go self harm and post it all over social media claiming I‚Äôd bullied her. She‚Äôs done it to others in the past. 

Advice please.  
My sister reckons I inform the facilitators that my boundaries and wishes are respected and not deprioritised against her. If they won‚Äôt speak to her about making those barbed comments about me, then I‚Äôll be reading out some texts that ‚Äúa former friend‚Äù sent me in my check in next week because fuck staying silent while she sits there and intimidates me and talks shite under a different name, relying on the fact I will keep it classy and be the bigger person.

1jb6nyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jb6nyv/i_f25_falling_in_love_with_someone_else_staying/,I (F25) falling in love with someone else? Staying with my now bf (M21)?,"
This may be a long story, and it may be a little confusing, but I promise I feel just as confused only hurting so much. 

Myself (F25) and bf (M21) have been dating for 3 and a half years. Yes, I‚Äôm aware of this age gap, but unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt aware in the beginning - so please bear with me. 

I fell in love with him at first sight, I knew I wanted him in my life, and for a long time at that. We clicked so easily. Sharing the same interests, hobbies.. everything felt like it was too good to be true, but it wasn‚Äôt. We were crazy for each other. 

During the first 2 years, we definitely had our ups and downs. He done some things that hurt me, things that I have tried my best to forget about. Some were honest mistakes, but others I don‚Äôt agree with being mistakes. I understand the age gap, and that this was his first real serious relationship, while it wasn‚Äôt mine. He didn‚Äôt understand for a long time why I wasn‚Äôt okay with him constantly messaging girls (even those who had interest in him - he didn‚Äôt see it this way). We even had an incident where screen shots were sent to me 2 years in, of him asking another girl for nude photos (a week after my birthday - and a month before our first trip together to celebrate our anniversary). My heart was thorn over this one. Part of me believes it could‚Äôve really been made look real to break us up, considering there were a couple of crazy girls in his past who weren‚Äôt happy about us dating. The other part, it just looked too real for it to not be true. Point being, we moved past it, even though it still crosses my mind from time to time. I didn‚Äôt want to lose him, and he seemed absolutely destroyed over this. I never did get the real answer as to what happened, but I was too scared to keep trying to find out. 

He would do anything for me, truly. I would go as far as saying he would take a bullet for me. I know he loves me, and I know he absolutely adores me and means well at heart. He makes me feel happy, and when I‚Äôm with him it feels like home. I look at him, and I literally see everything and more, I see my future husband, father of my kids, everything. 

The past 2 years we have actively been talking about buying a home together, and planning to have a child together in the future. Even getting married one day. 

The past, I would say year for sure‚Ä¶ things started to change. We still talk about our future, or hopes and our goals. But he stopped showing me attention like he once used to. We stopped going out a lot. We no longer go on fun adventures, drives, dates, movies, walks, etc. I‚Äôm not an expensive girl and he knows that, a $2 coffee date melts my heart. He claims he started having a lot of anxiety around people, and feeling very insecure about himself. The only issue is, he never once told me this. I couldn‚Äôt even notice anything was wrong like that. I noticed he was staying home a lot, gaming with his friends, not wanting to hangout, call, bailing on plans more than ever. The past 4 months of that year, I did notice that‚Äôs what the issue may be. I tried to spend to him so many times, over and over about how much it was hurting me. Asking if there was anything I could do to help. Anything. He didn‚Äôt want help, and nothing changed. No matter how many times I told him how much it hurt, like he didn‚Äôt care? That I missed him. 

Fast forward to the beginning of this year. I received some messages from another guy, let‚Äôs call him AB (M26), the sake of this story. Very friendly, respected that I was in a relationship and wouldn‚Äôt force anything on me. We started texting a lot, getting to know each other. He started becoming the friend I went to for advice and issues. It‚Äôs almost like we are looking for the same things in life. We actually hung out once before (strictly went for a drive - and he took me right back home). My current boyfriend found out, and he was absolutely furious. Rightfully so. But he assumed I had cheated. Yes, I fully admit to my faults in this situation. I should‚Äôve told him I was hanging out with AB (I didn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt looking for a fight, and only wanted to get out of my house for a couple of hours and actually do something because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore). It‚Äôs no excuse for how I handled this, and I‚Äôve been very open about how much i hurt him (even though me and AB were friends). Weeks went by and I never spoke to AB again. For some reason, it hurt. It hurt because nothing in my current relationship was changing for the better, and I had no one to even talk to. I would wait around forever for a message back from my boyfriend, no calls, or losing track of time just to end up not hanging out and cancelling plans. This repeated many times (apparently a year). 

I eventually added AB back on my socials again. I missed talking to him because he understood me so well. It was so easy to talk to him. He is straight to the point, very carefree and non problematic or judgmental. My boyfriend found out again - was furious. I accept that this hurt him and I may react the same way, but in that moment I just needed a friend. I didn‚Äôt cheat on him ever. I simply needed someone. 

I think the only issue is, I‚Äôve started falling for AB. It feels as though I am falling out of love with my current boyfriend, and into love with someone else. It absolutely terrifies me because I‚Äôve never experienced this before. I never thought I would ever have feeling for someone else besides my current boyfriend. This is why it‚Äôs absolutely killing me. 

Currently, my boyfriend is giving me all the attention I had been begging for, for the last year. But now suddenly, it feels like it doesn‚Äôt even matter. I‚Äôm overthinking if this is only because he seen someone else can do the same for me. If it is only because he is scared and doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. What if I‚Äôm a couple of months or a year, things go back to how they used to be, when we barely even hung out during the week. 

Not only this, but turning 26 this year is scaring me. I always wanted to rush through life, get married, buy a home etc. I felt like I needed to do this before a certain age. Now, the older I‚Äôm getting, the more I‚Äôm actually starting to think about my life and what I want. I‚Äôm starting to slow down and realize that there isn‚Äôt a time that things in life need to be done by. AB wants me to give him a chance. He is unbelievably sweet to me in every way possible. Everything I‚Äôve needed. Peace. Calm. I‚Äôve even tried my hardest to annoy him to prove that nobody can be this calm, but he just doesn‚Äôt get annoyed by anything I do or say. He is on the same page as me in life. Wants a serious relationship that‚Äôs actually going to go somewhere. 

This is what scares me most. What if I leave my current boyfriend for something that could be incredible and last. Or if I regret it so bad and never be able to have him back. Or what if I stay, be comfortable knowing it‚Äôs a definite we are getting married one day, but regret it later because I‚Äôm truly not happy anymore?

I feel so stuck. I never expected any of this to ever happen. And I‚Äôm scared. My head is confused. The thought of hurting my current boyfriend is killing me, but I‚Äôm trying to find my own happiness as well. I need advice. I feel like everything is changing so fast. Me, my age, life. It‚Äôs a lot and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. ",0,1741966347.0,relationship_advice,10,0.5,False

On his second album, Chicago rapper Saba breezes through so many moods and grave topics ‚Äî from mortality, depression, affliction ‚Äî while sounding like he‚Äôs just lolling at the local coffee shop. Bright, cool, and triumphant, Saba played counterpart to his cold-hearted drill contemporaries, heartening his city, which in 2018 saw about 561 homicides. ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù is a sweet paean to perseverance despite the loss of a friend, and the harrowing ‚ÄúProm/King,‚Äù wherein Saba raps about youthful ambition, being a virgin, and an M.I.A. pal, is lively enough to make you feel like you‚Äôre right there with him trooping it out. Saba‚Äôs devil-may-care swagger gives us a lot to care about



My Review:

The Album Opens with ‚ÄúBusy/Sirens‚Äù . It has this minimalist instrumental; it almost sounds like it was recorded underwater. Lyrically it delves into the death of his cousin John Walt who was murdered. ‚ÄúBroken Girls‚Äù feels like a Jay-Z song that has been transformed into a different universe where subdued bragging replaces the boisterous standard. ‚ÄúLife‚Äù has this jazzy bassline that gives it some bop. It suits Saba‚Äôs flow very well. He really goes off on some of his best bars on the record so far. ‚ÄúCalligraphy‚Äù continues that chilled yet jazzy instrumental. The piano riff is the foundation that Saba uses to flow. Lyrically ‚ÄúFighter‚Äù is about different altercations Saba have gotten into in his life. The chorus is so infectious. Sonically it continues this minimalist vibe but feels more vibrant. ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù has this soulful gospel tinged sound. ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù Saba‚Äôs flow just bops all over this place. Instrumentally it is a great mix of jazz infused ambient beats. ‚ÄúGrey‚Äù sonically just sucks you into that chill minimalist jazz instrumental. Saba uses the color grey to describe all the generic music that surrounds him so he tries to keep his rawness real. ‚ÄúProm/King‚Äù deals with the earliest memories of his cousin and fellow Pivot Gang member John Walt who was fatally stabbed in 2017. The first part ‚ÄúProm‚Äù recounts a disturbing prom experience Saba had when he was¬† threatened by his date‚Äôs brother. The second part ‚ÄúKing‚Äù details the events that led up to Walt‚Äôs stabbing. The album closes with ‚ÄúHeaven All Around Me‚Äù is told through the perspective of Walt after he died. It is a reflection of the afterlife that we hope happens to our loved ones when they leave us.¬†

My Thoughts:

My god this is a great hip hop album. I love finding an album I‚Äôve never listened to and being blown away by it. After all the years it's one of the best feelings I get. I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to listen to a personal hip-hop record. Is it one of the 250 best albums of the 21st century? That‚Äôs up for debate. I'll give Rolling Stone credit for having an alum like this on their list so people can hopefully discover it.¬†

1jb6mqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1jb6mqa/orthodoxy_has_an_inverted_view_of_history/,Orthodoxy has an inverted view of history,"

For forever before the late 19th century there was never more than a billion people on this planet at a time. Germ theory/immunization radically shifted life as we know it, and within a little over a hundred years we went from a billion people to over eight billion people.  

Using animals for transportation was the norm from before Christ, all the way up until the founding of America - and then automation came about. The automobile, air travel and in turn, the ability to push a button and wipe out Hiroshima. Not even 75 years before that we still used swords and single shot rifles while on the back of horses. 

The shifts I have experienced in my own lifetime have been radical. The mere fact that I can type this out on my phone, and post it for the entire world to see while drinking my coffee is something nobody could have dreamed of when I was a child. 

The contrast 

For the first 1000 years of church history doctrine and church practices evolved to the point that if you were a Christian in the first few hundred years you wouldn‚Äôt recognize the liturgy, the language of the Trinity (or God) or the common practices later normalized by councils. Hell, you wouldn‚Äôt even be able to read unless you were from a rich family. 

For the first 400 years of church history, it was seen by many that castration was a suitable practice, and not until the first council did the church decide that this was nuts (zinger!). 

Infant baptism was not normalized until St Gregory the Theologian in the mid 4th century. Constantine wasn‚Äôt baptized until his deathbed and Augustine Christian mother didn‚Äôt baptize Augustine as an infant. It was St Gregory who made the practice a norm. 

The liturgy was greatly altered by St Chrysostom after the christianization of the Roman Empire and the lack of attendance due to a more cushy life Christians experienced. 

If you were to live and believe as those who believed in the first 400 years of church history you‚Äôd be anathematized today in the Orthodox Church. I mean, just try and castrate yourself while not being baptized and expect communion. 

These are just a few shifts in thought I‚Äôve used for examples, but it seemed as though any philosophical influence, or outside religious influence, meant the need for a council or local council to correct the church. 

However

In the world be live in today which has seen the most radical changes to reality ever in human history, Orthodoxy says that there is no need for councils. No need for change, and that what is needed is for you and I to go back in time and just exist as we used to. 

This is where I see Eastern Orthodoxy being the most non traditional tradition out there today. Never in the first 1000 years of Christian history was there a church who functioned as a museum.

    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

As David walked back to the living room, the pizzas in hand, Charlotte followed close behind, her tone sharp and mocking. ‚ÄúWell, that was embarrassing. Do you always make such a fool of yourself, or was that a special performance just for us?‚Äù

David didn‚Äôt respond. He set the pizzas on the coffee table and sat down on the edge of the couch, his shoulders slumped and his eyes fixed on the floor.

Emma, who had been watching the exchange with a small smile, reached over and patted David‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be too hard on him, Charlotte. He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ shy.‚Äù

Charlotte rolled her eyes, her tone dismissive. ‚ÄúShy? More like pathetic. But whatever. Let‚Äôs eat.‚Äù

As Emma and Charlotte dug into the pizzas, their laughter filling the room, David sat there, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts.

The living room was filled with the savory aroma of freshly delivered pizza. Emma and Charlotte sat on the couch, each holding a slice, their laughter and chatter filling the room. David sat awkwardly on the edge of the couch, his stomach growling as he watched them eat. He had hoped to have a slice or two for himself, but it quickly became clear that wasn‚Äôt going to happen.

Emma devoured her pizza with gusto, her eyes sparkling with satisfaction as she finished the last bite of her second slice. ‚ÄúMmm, that was so good,‚Äù she said, licking her fingers. ‚ÄúI could eat pizza every day.‚Äù

Charlotte, on the other hand, was more meticulous. She ate the toppings and cheese with precision, leaving behind the crusts, which she piled onto a plate. When she was done, she glanced at David, her smirk widening. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said, pushing the plate of crusts toward him. ‚ÄúYou can have these. Consider it your reward for being such a good little helper.‚Äù

David hesitated, his stomach growling louder. He picked up one of the crusts and took a small bite, chewing slowly. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ thanks,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs not much flavor or sauce on the crust.‚Äù

Charlotte laughed, her tone sharp and mocking. ‚ÄúNot much flavor? Oh, we can fix that.‚Äù She stood up and walked to the kitchen, her movements quick and deliberate. A moment later, she returned with a bottle of sriracha sauce in one hand and a mischievous grin on her face.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said, squeezing a generous amount of the spicy sauce onto each crust. ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôll have plenty of flavor. Ungrateful little wimp.‚Äù

Emma giggled, her eyes sparkling with amusement as she watched Charlotte work. ‚ÄúOh, Charlotte, you‚Äôre so creative.‚Äù

Charlotte smirked and handed the plate back to David. ‚ÄúThere you go. Eat up. And don‚Äôt leave a single bite, or else.‚Äù

David stared at the plate of sauced-up crusts, his stomach churning at the thought of eating them. He picked up one of the crusts and took a cautious bite, his eyes watering almost immediately from the heat of the sriracha. He chewed slowly, trying to mask his discomfort, but it was no use.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ this is really spicy,‚Äù he said, his voice strained. ‚ÄúCan I‚Ä¶ maybe have something to drink?‚Äù

Charlotte leaned back on the couch, her smirk widening. ‚ÄúOh, no. It‚Äôs not healthy to eat and drink at the same time. You‚Äôll have to finish everything first.‚Äù

David‚Äôs heart sank, but he didn‚Äôt argue. He took another bite, his mouth burning with every chew. After a few more bites, he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. ‚ÄúMy mouth is on fire,‚Äù he said, his voice pleading. ‚ÄúCan I please have something to drink?‚Äù

Emma glanced at Charlotte, her expression one of mild concern. ‚ÄúMaybe we should let him have a drink. He looks like he‚Äôs struggling.‚Äù

Charlotte rolled her eyes, her tone dismissive. ‚ÄúFine. But I‚Äôll decide what he drinks.‚Äù

She stood up and walked to the kitchen, her movements slow and deliberate. A moment later, she returned with a glass of water and a jar of mayonnaise. David‚Äôs eyes widened as she scooped a large spoonful of mayonnaise into the water and stirred it vigorously.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said, holding the glass out to David. ‚ÄúDrink up.‚Äù

David hesitated, his stomach churning at the thought of drinking the concoction. But before he could protest, Charlotte grabbed the back of his head and tilted it back, forcing the glass to his lips. She poured the mixture into his mouth, her movements quick and efficient.

David choked slightly, the thick, oily liquid coating his throat as he struggled to swallow. Some of it spilled down his chin, and Charlotte wiped her hands on his hair, her smirk widening.

‚ÄúThere,‚Äù she said, her tone sharp and mocking. ‚ÄúNow stop whining and finish your food. And don‚Äôt you dare complain about the taste or the burning again, okay, wimp?‚Äù

David sat there, his mouth still burning from the sriracha and his stomach churning from the mayonnaise water. He picked up another crust and took a small bite, his movements slow and deliberate. Emma and Charlotte continued to chat and laugh, their voices bright and carefree, completely oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside him.

The living room was a mess‚Äîempty pizza boxes stacked on the coffee table, plates with crumbs and crusts scattered around, and wine glasses half-filled with the remnants of Emma and Charlotte‚Äôs drinks. Emma leaned back on the couch, her legs tucked beneath her, while Charlotte lounged beside her, her phone in hand. Both of them looked perfectly at ease, as if the chaos around them was someone else‚Äôs problem.

Emma glanced at David, who was standing awkwardly by the table, his hands full of dirty plates. ‚ÄúDavid, sweetie, can you clean this up for us? Charlotte and I are going to relax for a bit.‚Äù

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumping slightly as he began gathering the plates and pizza boxes. He carried them to the kitchen, his movements slow and deliberate, his mind already racing with the mountain of tasks ahead of him. As he loaded the dishwasher and wiped down the counters, he could hear Emma and Charlotte laughing in the living room, their voices bright and carefree.

Once the kitchen was relatively clean, David returned to the living room, a bottle of wine in hand. Emma and Charlotte were deep in conversation, their glasses nearly empty. David hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ do you want me to refill your glasses?‚Äù

Emma looked up, her smile widening. ‚ÄúOh, yes, please. You‚Äôre such a sweetheart, David.‚Äù

Charlotte smirked, her tone sharp and mocking. ‚ÄúAbout time. I was starting to think you forgot about us.‚Äù

David didn‚Äôt respond. He poured the wine carefully, making sure not to spill a drop, and handed the glasses back to Emma and Charlotte. Emma took hers with a smile, while Charlotte barely acknowledged him, her attention already back on her phone.

As David turned to leave, Emma‚Äôs voice stopped him. ‚ÄúWait, David. Don‚Äôt go yet. Charlotte and I were just talking about playing a game. You should join us.‚Äù

David hesitated, his exhaustion evident. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I still have a lot to clean up, and‚Äî‚Äù

Emma cut him off with a wave of her hand, her tone casual but firm. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be such a bore. The cleaning can wait. This‚Äôll be fun. Right, Charlotte?‚Äù

Charlotte glanced up from her phone, her smirk widening. ‚ÄúSure. Why not? It‚Äôs not like he has anything better to do.‚Äù

Emma clapped her hands together, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ‚ÄúGreat! Here‚Äôs how it works: David, you‚Äôll have to act out something that I whisper in your ear, and Charlotte has to guess what it is. Then, Charlotte will whisper something to you, and I‚Äôll guess. Got it?‚Äù

David nodded silently, his heart sinking. He knew this wasn‚Äôt going to be fun for him, but he didn‚Äôt dare argue. Instead, he sat down on the edge of the couch, his hands folded in his lap, and waited for the game to begin.

Emma leaned in close to David, her breath warm against his ear as she whispered the first word:¬†*‚ÄúWorship.‚Äù*

David‚Äôs eyes widened slightly, but he nodded, his mind racing as he tried to figure out how to act out the word. He stood up awkwardly, his movements stiff and hesitant, and walked over to Emma. He dropped to his knees in front of her, his hands clasped together as if in prayer, and looked up at her with an exaggerated expression of adoration.

Charlotte watched with a smirk, her arms crossed as she tried to guess. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ crawling? No, wait‚Äîare you pretending to be a worm?‚Äù

David shook his head, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. He tried again, this time bowing his head low and pressing his forehead to the floor in front of Emma‚Äôs feet. He stayed like that for a moment, his hands still clasped together, before looking up at her again, his eyes wide and pleading.

Charlotte laughed, her tone sharp and mocking. ‚ÄúOh, I get it. You‚Äôre groveling. Is that it? Groveling?‚Äù

David shook his head again, his frustration growing. He stood up and gestured toward Emma, his movements exaggerated as he mimed placing a crown on her head. Then he dropped back to his knees and bowed again, his hands outstretched as if offering her something.

Emma giggled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. ‚ÄúOh, come on, Charlotte. It‚Äôs obvious. He‚Äôs¬†*worshipping*¬†me.‚Äù

Charlotte rolled her eyes, her tone dismissive. ‚ÄúFine.. my turn, let's go David.'

Charlotte leaned in close to David, her smirk widening as she whispered the next word:¬†*‚ÄúNerd.‚Äù*¬†She laughed softly as she pulled away, her eyes glinting with mischief.

David‚Äôs heart sank, but he didn‚Äôt argue. He stood up and adjusted his glasses, pushing them up his nose in an exaggerated motion. Then he mimed typing on a keyboard, his fingers moving quickly as he pretended to be deeply focused on a computer screen.

Charlotte watched with a smirk, her tone teasing. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ are you pretending to be a hacker? Or maybe just a loser?‚Äù

David shook his head, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. He tried again, this time miming reading a book, his movements slow and deliberate. He adjusted his glasses again and pretended to flip through pages, his expression one of intense concentration.

Emma giggled, her eyes sparkling with amusement. ‚ÄúOh, I know! He‚Äôs a nerd!‚Äù

Charlotte rolled her eyes, her tone dismissive. ‚ÄúFine. Nerd. Your turn, Emma.‚Äù

Emma leaned in close to David, her breath warm against his ear as she whispered the next word: ‚ÄúButtplug.‚Äù She pulled away with a mischievous giggle, her eyes sparkling with amusement. David‚Äôs face turned bright red, and he froze for a moment, unsure of how to proceed. Acting out this word in front of Emma and Charlotte was beyond humiliating, but he knew better than to refuse.

He stood up awkwardly, his movements stiff and hesitant, and glanced at Charlotte, who was already smirking, her arms crossed as she waited for him to begin. David took a deep breath and tried to mime the concept as subtly as possible. He pretended to hold something small in his hand, his movements exaggerated, and then gestured toward his backside, his face burning with embarrassment.

Charlotte burst out laughing, her tone sharp and mocking. ‚ÄúWhat on earth are you doing? Are you pretending to be a‚Ä¶ a clown? Or maybe just an idiot?‚Äù

David shook his head, his frustration growing. He tried again, this time miming walking stiffly, as if something were lodged uncomfortably in his backside. He winced slightly, his movements exaggerated, and glanced at Emma, hoping she would guess quickly and put an end to this.

But Emma wasn‚Äôt satisfied. She tilted her head, her smile widening as she watched him struggle. ‚ÄúOh, come on, David. You‚Äôre not trying hard enough. Charlotte‚Äôs never going to guess at this rate.‚Äù

David‚Äôs heart sank, but he didn‚Äôt argue. He tried one more time, this time miming inserting something into his backside with more emphasis, his face turning an even deeper shade of red. Charlotte laughed harder, her tone dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúOh, I get it. You‚Äôre pretending to be a‚Ä¶ a walking disaster? Or maybe just a complete weirdo?‚Äù

Emma sighed dramatically, her patience wearing thin. ‚ÄúThis is taking too long. Let me help you out, David.‚Äù

Before David could react, Emma stood up and walked over to him. She grabbed the waistband of his pants and, without warning, yanked them down to his ankles. David‚Äôs eyes widened in shock, and he instinctively tried to cover himself, but Emma was already reaching for the half-empty wine bottle on the table.

‚ÄúWhat are you‚Äî‚Äù David started, but Emma cut him off.

‚ÄúRelax, David,‚Äù she said, her tone casual but firm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here for our entertainment, remember? And this is definitely entertaining.‚Äù

Before David could protest further, Emma pressed the neck of the wine bottle against him and, with a sharp push, forced it into place. David let out a pained yelp, his face contorting in discomfort, but Emma just laughed, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Charlotte, meanwhile, was doubled over with laughter, her voice loud and unrestrained. ‚ÄúOh my God, Emma! What are you doing?‚Äù

Emma grinned, her tone playful. ‚ÄúHelping him out, obviously. Now guess, Charlotte. What‚Äôs he supposed to be?‚Äù

Charlotte wiped tears of laughter from her eyes and tried to catch her breath. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ an anal slut? Or maybe‚Ä¶ a buttplug?‚Äù

Emma clapped her hands together, her smile triumphant. ‚ÄúDing ding ding! Correct! A buttplug!‚Äù

Both Emma and Charlotte burst into laughter, their voices filling the room as David stood there, his face burning with humiliation and his body stiff with discomfort.

The room was thick with tension, the air heavy with the weight of the game‚Äôs escalating absurdity. David sat on the edge of the couch, his hands clenched tightly in his lap, his face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and frustration. Charlotte‚Äôs smirk was unwavering, her sharp eyes locked on him as if she were a predator toying with her prey. Emma, meanwhile, was still giggling, her laughter light and carefree, as if she were oblivious to the discomfort radiating from David.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Charlotte said, her voice cutting through the room like a knife. ‚ÄúMy turn to whisper something.‚Äù",3,1741966115.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False
1jb6kdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jb6kdu/aitah_for_thinking_about_cutting_off_my_friend/,AITAH for thinking about cutting off my friend for not attending my wedding?,"First, a little context.  Me (f, mid-20s) and my friend Carli (fake name, f, mid-20s) have been friends since high school.  While we didn't text or hangout on a very regular basis, we still became pretty close- I was at her bachelorette party, I was one of her bridesmaids, I knew her family and future in-laws, and she said I was like a sister to her.  Even though we didn't talk super regularly, I considered her one of my most important friendships.

The last time I saw her was a couple years ago at her wedding.  Over the years, I texted her a handful of times inviting her to get coffee, but she was always busy.  I thought that was fair enough- I was also very busy, and knowing her, I figured she was probably hard at work getting her life in order (she suffered a lot of setbacks in high school and early college, so she was constantly working on a degree, a couple jobs, and moving around with her boyfriend). So I let her be.

Before I get to the current situation, here's something else that's important: I dated a friend of hers for a couple years before her wedding.  She was really happy for us, but when things fell apart, I was never able to hook back up with her to give her a feel for the situation, and I intentionally never explained \*exactly\* why we had broken up when she reached out over text. I'm not sure what he told her, but I initiated the breakup because of a major lack of communication and accountability, and because he was getting a little extra-friendly with one of his female friends (possibly not an outright affair, but definitely some heavy flirting at minimum). I thought it would be smart to keep quiet about the breakup so as not to make an awkward situation for all our mutual friends, including Carli- they had nothing to do with it, why make them feel a need to take sides?  It's also important to note that he's now married to the girl he was talking to while we dated.

Now, I got engaged a couple years ago.  I didn't post anything on social media, so I just reached out to the most important people directly.  Of course Carli was one of them; she congratulated me, nothing seemed amiss. I think I asked her once more if she and her husband could meet up with me & my fiance so I could introduce them, but she said she didn't have time.  I was a little hurt, but I figured she was overwhelmed.

The trouble started a few months before my wedding.  Now admittedly, I got the invitations out a little late- about two months beforehand, although I did text them asking for their new address, and I specified that it was for a wedding invitation. I don't think a late-ish notice was the problem, though. The problem was that Carli had a baby a few months before I sent the invitations, and my wedding was ""adults only"". 

About a month before the wedding, she texted me telling me she & her husband couldn't make it.  She said it was because they couldn't bring the baby & she didn't want to mess up our day, but that she was hoped it was nice.  I was a little shocked, not only because I considered her to be one of my most important friends and thought she would be at my wedding for sure, but because something in that message sounded a little off.  No ill intent or anything, but the message sounded a little cold, like she was trying to get me off her back.  I know it sounds weird, I just figured I'd mention it because I probably wouldn't be writing this if she really sounded sorry.

Now I understand that a baby is a completely life-altering thing- it radically changes your priorities, the way you think, and your responsibilities.  I also understand it is incredibly taxing, physically and mentally.  Even though I was, frankly, hurt by the rejection, I believed it was a legitimate reason for her & figured it wasn't my place to bitch about a brand-new mom not being able to stretch herself to fit what I wanted- this was the time to make accommodations for someone I cared about.  I waited a few days to process it (maybe this was a mistake, but I was legitimately so shocked and hurt that I figured my tone would bleed into my message until I calmed down). 

I reached out again and offered a few alternatives- I offered to let her bring the baby (it was a small ceremony anyways, and the no-kids rule was mostly to keep the not-so-bright guests from bringing multiple rowdy 2-year-olds on a whim), or to just come for part of the ceremony. I ended by telling her that I didn't really care for a perfect day, I just wanted the important people there for a hug & a picture. She said no again, and was more insistent this time- an escalated, less-veiled version of the tone I detected in her previous message. She said she'd been having serious medical issues since the birth and that the baby was very colicky and she just wouldn't be able to come. I said that was fine & that I understood and I didn't message her again. 

The day came & it was beautiful.  No complaints there.  I wondered if maybe she would text me some well-wishes; didn't hear anything from her (to be fair, I wasn't exactly reminding anyone via social media posts, and none of my other friends texted me, even though I know they were happy for me). Honeymoon passed, been living with my husband for a bit now, haven't heard anything from her. 

In case you couldn't tell, I was pretty hurt by all this and have had a lot of time to think about it.  A couple things have been bothering me.  First, Carli has a lot of close, trustworthy family around, several of whom are stay-at-home parents; I wondered why she couldn't have had some of them take care of the baby and drive her to the ceremony.  Around Christmas, I saw some pictures of her around her family, so it seemed like she was at least kind of capable of going to an event. I try to write this one off, though, because I have no right to judge the severity of her medical issues or abilities, and I think severe sickness and a fussy baby and breastfeeding combined are legitimate reasons for skipping a wedding.

What bothers me a little more is that she didn't even reach out.  I know I said that my other friends hadn't reached out either and it didn't offend me, but I'm not nearly as close with them. Carli was different; I've known her for so long, I was at her wedding, I knew her family and her in-laws, and we were like sisters. I know a baby is incredibly taxing, but if I was like a sister to her, why didn't she make a note of when my wedding was and send me a little heartfelt message the day of? That would have been plenty for me. And after talking to me like my wedding invitation was a chore to be rejected, no further attempt at conversation or anything? I thought that maybe she was sick that day, but then why didn't she reach out after she got better? I don't think she cared, y'all.

And finally, the situation with my ex. I feel shitty comparing the perceived levels of my friend's support toward me vs my ex-boyfriend, but here's the deal. That relationship sucked for me, and it also sucked choosing to tell everyone that ""we were just incompatible"" when in reality it was because he would spend hours scrolling TikTok but wouldn't take 15 minutes to have a conversation with me everyday, or because he was clearly chatting up this other woman (and occasionally comparing me to her in a really snide way) and telling me nothing was going on and that I was just jealous, or that whenever I would make effort to talk about our problems in a calm, collected way, he wouldn't change and then would later accuse me of not giving him enough grace or time to work out his issues.  I shoved that down so no one else would feel awkward about having a friendship with either of us.  Then I find out via the Instagram comment section on their wedding photos that Carli is friends with the couple that had a soft-emotional-affair on me.  I know she doesn't know the real reasons I left him, and I'm not mad at her for that; I'm just hurt that she's apparently still friends with them (more importantly, that she was able to make time for them, because evidently she's hung out with them, whilst she was too busy for me) but couldn't give me the time of day- not to meet me for a cup of coffee, not to get introduced to my fiance, and not to send me a well-wish text on my wedding day.  Also, this will sound stupid, but she posts her baby on Instagram; if she can take 30 seconds to post, why couldn't she take 30 seconds to text me on one of the most important days of my life? Or any of the days after?

So idk what to do, y'all.  Here's what I think has happened: Carli is exhausted from the baby, so everyone that isn't direct family has fallen to the wayside.  She probably forgot about my wedding because she was exhausted and stressed and thinking about the baby.  She naturally ended up closer to my ex because they were friends a little longer than me and Carli, and she has no idea that he was chatting up his now-wife while he was still with me; I'm the only one who's upset about it because I'm the only one in our mutual friend group who knows. She probably still cares about me- definitely doesn't wish me ill- but just doesn't have the bandwidth for me right now.  She probably thinks nothing of any of this.

On the other hand, I tried so many times to reach out and catch up with her.  I tried making accommodations for her, and I didn't ask much. The fact that she couldn't take the initiative to give me some bare minimum interaction on the most important day of my life, or afterwards, hurts really bad. It also makes me think that, even though she has no ill intent, the lack of effort is just not something a good friend would do. The thought has occurred to me to stop talking to her altogether- she probably wouldn't notice, anyways, at least not until she's missed a ton of my life.

But she's an overwhelmed new mom, and she was a good friend to me for so long.  I'm sure she doesn't mean to hurt me on purpose. AITAH for thinking of throwing it all away? Just cutting her off when she's at her most stressed and sickly and tired? Am I asking too much? I feel like such an AH for even thinking of cutting her off when she was so kind to me in high school/college.

Would appreciate some input because I'm probably gonna drop by her house next week to drop off those baby-related gifts I got for her around Christmas (I never got around to doing it, partially because of the whole wedding invitation thing). Gifts from me showing up on her doorstep might prompt her to reach out to me, and if she does, I really don't know what to say.

TLDR: Long-time close friend didn't come to my wedding or reach out at all. On one hand, she's a new mom and probably just stressed & exhausted. On the other hand, she was able to make time for her family and other people, she has repeatedly turned down my attempts to hang out, and I don't think a nice text on a wedding day is too much to ask.

All 7 of us in this house. I'm stuck. I want to go away. I'm desperately missing a home, a world that is safe, familiar and full of comfort. Not having had a proper home in 8 year is BRUTAL. I'm also very ashamed at the idea of explaining to a potential boyfriend that I have flatmates at 41 and my dream was anyway to move in with my partner not to go to a studio apartment alone in the periphery, it feels even more lonely and squalid. 

There is no family or family money left, I'm really alone (basically the parents who were abusive met with the downfall caused by their choices and reacted poorly accordingly). 

This is a 1.5 million people European city (double that number during the day due to commuters) and it's a backward country so I can't move outside because I'm part of the lgbt community and having spent the first 16 years of my life in those smaller towns I know exactly that is unbearable. Prices here are sky high as everywhere after the pandemic. Suburban public transport is really so-so and unlike everyone else there I don't have a car. 

There are a lot of problems in this:

\- my sleep is constantly disrupted by people waking up earlier or coming back home late at night

\- the hygiene is not so great especially in the kitchen and there is a constant smell of laundry detergents and the occasional second hand smoke, I'm sure I've got some issue due to that 

\- I can't relax because the nearby laundry machine get started (sharing a wall) and people sit in the common area to chat (just outside my door)

\- this room is only 11 mq and moving a lot around in confined space it's messing up my joints

\- we had a ton of people coming and going, very embarrassing, and also some abusive jerk

\- landlord turned scummy and a bad person who actually don't care about people and the law

I thought it would be safe here because he is my ex coworker so I thought he would look out for me and protect me, but it has changed. And I cannot stand people who play fast and loose with the law.

I also wanted to stay here because there is a garden outside and I grew up with trees around and for me nature is fundamental, I cannot stand to live in pure concrete, but it's impossible to have this kind of life for a decent price in the city. Maybe I'm grasping at straws but there is also now someone in the flat above who plays the piano, and that soothes me.

This flat is also near a stop of the metro, so it's very well connected until midnight. I have no social life and due to my job cannot attend dance classes (trying to find another job). If I move in the suburbs I'm toast, no social life ever, no classes, no nothing. And bigotry at my gender identity.

I would need 5 k that I don't have (we are looking at 2 years of hard savings with no life, postponing any kind of sport and socialisation again and again... not even a coffee at a cafe) and then I would have to blow up all that money being left with zero savings just to rent the squalid studio apartment mentioned before. Getting another room at my age is super shameful.

What can I do? I'm in hell here but it's paradise compared to everywhere else. The only thing that I'm sure of is that life was NOT supposed to go like this. Oh, and it's too late to have a good life, I should have got it right at age 25, now it's playing catch up and being the midlife crisis tee-hee wannabe youngster. Missed out on life, stuck here.

Ignore, block and delete.

Fast forward to a few days ago‚Ä¶March 2025

My small company has a contact form on its website. And the form submissions go straight to a work email, managed by an assistant.

Few days ago, I was alerted about an unusual form submission. Someone reaching out to me personally, and used a unique nickname.

I checked the entry myself and boom it was my ex. Same person who sent the coffee email pero may hint ng hotel hahaha.

Turns out the phone number he used on the form is still his number and same email parin. But this contact has been saved on my personal as ‚ÄúDo Not Reply XXX‚Äù

¬†

I went through my photo album‚Ä¶.what I found out was, he stalked me on LinkedIn nung 2020 pa.

I opened up to my friends‚Ä¶turns out in 2023-2024 he‚Äôs been messaging my friends. Some kinamusta nya pero dedma, yung ka-close nya hinihingi pa number ko.

Nainis ulit ako. Pwede naman ako lang guluhin mo‚Ä¶.pero idadamay mo pa friends ko na wala namang malay?

¬†

Eh di ni stalk ko rin sya. He has a very public social media. Digital security whomstve. Turns out he has a toddler. Always taking photos and vids of the kid and set to public(?!!) And a baby momma. I could hear her voice in the video, and she‚Äôs been in the holiday greetings from family pics. I‚Äôve heard of his ‚Äúsetup‚Äù but only had visual confirmation now.

Nakakagilawlaw realizing the times he sent those emails nag-aaya sa hotel, he is doing family stuff with family. Timestamps don‚Äôt lie.

As I scroll through his very public profile, I can see he‚Äôs been sharing memories. Not just random ones. Those were our vacation photos ‚Äì pero since profile nya yun, solo version.

Same destination, I remember the clothes he wore ‚Äì bc I bought and styled them, pero syempre hindi ako kasali sa pictures.

For example, kunyari in 2023, he shared an album na we went to Carrot Island kunyari, pero puro pictures lang nya.

I own the OG albums where his solo photos are also part of a bigger album na may solo photos din ako and pictures of us together.

These sharing of memories are not a one off thing. Parang halos lahat ng napuntahan namin when we were together na share nya. Big or small. From a grand vacation to a tiny caf√© visit, na share nya as memories.

All while sharing ATM photos of his growing toddler in between. Kaloka. I feel bad for the family nya. Kahit di sila kasal or anything. Na wow katabi mo pero iba iniisip?

I‚Äôm counting the days I can meet with my legal counsel and mental health providers. Until I meet them next week, I just wanna get this off my chest.

**Background for the curious:**

We met 2014. We ended things pre-pandemic, around 2019. We‚Äôve been on many trips around the Philippines. Even joined a family trip. Introduced to gradeschool friends. Highschool friends know him. Been roommates, dine out, out of town trips with my friends.

Mabait naman pero ‚Äì tambay. Never really had a job until I met him. One time ako pa nga kumuha ng job para sa kanya. Palainom ‚Äì not just casual 1-2 bottles. Heavy drinking that usually leads to lupasay on the floor. I rarely drink. Drinking ¬Ω bottle of beer gives me a hangover that lasts 2-3 business days.

You know that scene on The Hows of Us‚Ä¶yung nangsundo si George kay Primo na lasing. ganun, but IRL, and it happened more than once, parang halos weekly and before the movie came out.

One time sinamahan ko sya sa inuman tapos may big job interview ako the next day. Late ata ako bc of the night ganaps, buti nalang I got the job.

We‚Äôve been visiting his family house especially pag extended holidays like summer and December and I just realized he never formally introduced me to his mother, who refuses to acknowledge me even when we are inches away at the dining table.

He‚Äôs Visayan and I‚Äôm from Luzon. He always reassured me that it was just language barrier. I don‚Äôt buy it bc I can hold a basic conversation and I can understand their language and can respond in English, Filipino and basic Visayan.

I ended things the moment plane landed on his hometown. Na-realize ko it‚Äôs not enough someone loves me. I want someone who‚Äôs on the same level as my ambition, drive, lifestyle preferences. And someone who‚Äôs not a freeloader. I saved more money just spending housing, utilities, groceries, eating out , going out for just one person. Laking ginahawa ng walang pabigat.

I'm aware of the flaws in the Kalita's design. I even drilled the holes to be slightly bigger and it improved but still stalls regularly. 

In recent months I have rekindled my love of coffee and pour overs and revamped my set up. I use good water, and a good grinder, etc. BUT holy shit the Kalita is so inconsistent.

i‚Äôm definitely not super extroverted so idk if it‚Äôs just me :( i really try to make an effort to be social, but it can be so tough being the only person at a large event attending alone. i talk to ppl from time to time, have nice convos, but no true friendships have formed. everyone seems to have their own group and have known eachother since high school, so i feel like a bit of an outsider.

i know it‚Äôs not other people‚Äôs responsibility but i wish ppl would sometimes come up to me when they see me alone :( i always make an effort to talk to a sister if she‚Äôs sitting alone. my husband says the men‚Äôs side is a lot different and more welcoming, which is interesting.

it‚Äôs been isolating not having any close friends nearby that i can occasionally text, get coffee with, etc. wondering if i should just give up trying and prioritize my friendships w/ friends from my hometown.

We were at the table and I asked if he would like my actual number because we were using Snapchat. He said yes and handed me his phone so I could put in my number, when he got a snap from some girl let's call her Hanna. He goes oh don't worry about it she's a problem. I asked why and he said she really wanted to be with him but he rejected her. 

I was like it's a bit odd to get snaps from her, if you didn't add her back or he could have blocked her I didn't say any of this. I could be wrong about how Snapchat works but I think that's how it works. 

We went out on a date the next Thursday and he came and brought me food that Saturday. We haven't seen eachother since. But we talk every day we made plans for another date but he cancelled because his work called him in which I understood. Then when it came to the day we rescheduled his car was broke down so again I understood. 

Then I asked if I could come see him he said he'd come get me then I could get an Uber home. I thought ok that works I really want to see him. But he cancelled again because of his relitive being sick and him having to take care of her which I get. He also is in a toxic house hold so maybe he's been forced to help I have no clue.

But this is the third time he's had to cancel and I feel like Hanna might be part of it. he was cheated on and I think she's his ex and he is stuck on her.

Charles - I told u I don't like texting. either you call me or I see u in person. make the decision .

me - I have a better suggestion, if I decide to meet you in person will you promise to apologize ?. In addition, I‚Äôd like for you to explain why you think I‚Äôm not capable of formulating my own opinions and thoughts. Two things for you to reflect on. If you promise to apologize in person, I‚Äôll come. Let me know. No insults, no threats will be exchanged.

Charles - I'm not promising anything. we'll talk like reasonable men.

me - What does that mean bro, it‚Äôs a simple question . Anyways, I can tell you are offended by the way you hung up on me. You changed from ""either call me or talk to me in person"" to ""talk to me in person"". Not so reasonable in my books I‚Äôll be on campus after I finish my laundry and the clothes dry. Offended because I said ""ego guy"".

Charles : I‚Äôll see u then

me - Saying sorry doesn‚Äôt make you less of a man, just want to put that out there. I‚Äôm letting you know now, if you don‚Äôt apologize within 2 minutes of meeting I‚Äôm walking away.

Charles - so don't come. I told u I don't respond well to threats. stop texting me I told you to meet there. we're reasonable men, im not worried about face to face interaction

me - That‚Äôs the issue, this isn‚Äôt a threat Charles it‚Äôs an expectation. Learn the difference

Charles - ok see u there.

me - Can I answer this truthfully? I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve been reasonable since I‚Äôve addressed this head on. But, if you feel you have, please enlighten me . just out of curiosity, what does face to face change for you.

Charles - I told you stop texting me. I don't want to text.

me - Lastly, when you apologize within two minutes of meeting, you‚Äôre going to equally say sorry for claiming I was bullying you For someone who I‚Äôve told my entire life to (especially in fine detail of how I was bullied) I‚Äôd assume you wouldn‚Äôt jump to that conclusion

Charles - see u there.

me - im not coming

Charles - I respect that im ready to meet when u are but I will have no one dictate what im going to say, how, and when, I have no problem apologizing but after discussing things in person. no weapons formed against me, including threats, shall prosper. see u soon.

me - I hear u and I respect your stance as well. I agree that it's important to have a real conversation in person. let's meet and talk things through. I just want to make sure we both have a constructive and respectful convo when the time comes. Just to clarify, I wasn't threatening nobody.

Charles - excellent, I admire this. let me know when.

me - to be frank, but you are being very unreasonable when someone addresses your arrogant comments.

Charles - there you go again, ill see u soon.

me - I don't appreciate this man, especially from you who is, more often than not, very understanding. this 180 flip doesn't make sense to me. at least tell me the time and place rather than repeatedly saying see u soon.

Charles - today anytime past 4.

me - cool.

\-as we're approaching 4.

Charles - lets make it after 5.

me - why what happened

Charles - ill be late if u come around that time.

me - why? dude, what changed. when we chat today, im not looking for arguments Charles. I hope ive made that clear im also not looking for passive aggressive behaviour like u did on the phone. if we even are going to chat today, I don't even know if youre going to show up.

Charles - ill see u after 5

me - not if you plan on arguing. I need a clear answer. Last time, u got extremely emotional during our convo and I don't want that to happen again.

(I call him and he doesn't pick up)

Charles - can I call u later ?

me - up to you. what time. be precise. Forget it, this is too much hassle for you to see how arrogant your comment was and it‚Äôs not guaranteed that you won‚Äôt be combattive. see u another day.

Charles - Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.

me - im coming. let me get dressed and ready my clothes is still drying

Charles - ok

me - would u like to have a meal together brother ?

Charles - thank you but im afraid I just ate. im down for coffee or tea while u eat.

me - if its gonna be our last time, lets eat don't be like that

Charles - im actually full no joke.

me - even some fries ? or an appetizer

Charles - a drink is the most I can. imagine was expecting to be at the library so I ate beforehand.

\-(we met and I already told u how the interaction went in person then I sent him this)

me - I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop. I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this.

I did it, I broke the upper rear shock mount bolt. For the past six days I have put the nozzle of the PB Blaster up inside the frame rail to soak the welded nuts. The first one came out fine, but I noticed that it looked dry and rusty for all the penetrant I had soaked it with. 

Now I am regretting every decision that led me here, from the setting on my impact driver to the decision to replace all four shocks. 

The shock that came off seems to still have plenty of rebound, and it‚Äôs a Gabriel. I based my decision to replace with cheapies from eBay on the carnival ride aspect of the Jeep, and the quantity of rust on the shock housing.

I also learned on this sub that chocolate has a lot of caffeine in it as well, and I have been avoiding that and keeping chocolate consumption minimal. I know its not perfect but It works for me.

I enjoy not having the caffeine jitters, the afternoon crashes, and the restless sleep. I now fall asleep fast and easily, and I dream a lot more. I feel a lot more refreshed when I wake up as well. I haven't had any panic attacks since I quit (which is amazing for me!) and I am a lot less irritable. This experience has been so worth it!

After 5 years of ruminating on the thought of having ADHD, I managed to do the QB-test. 1.5 years ago I went to the psychiatrist that sent me to do it, I managed to bring myself to the test only today. My biggest fear was that it will show me I don‚Äôt have ADHD and all the problems I have are of my own stupidity. My fears came true. 

Test results came back as ‚Äúaverage compared to women of your group‚Äù in all departments. I am crushed. Yesterday I failed my driver‚Äôs exam for the 4th time because I couldn‚Äôt keep myself locked in on the road, but somehow managed to ace the QB-test. 

I still have DIVA test ahead of me and proper psychiatric evaluation at the end, so maybe it isn‚Äôt over. Over those 5 years since I found out that ADHdD exists I was completely sure I exhibited a lot of ADHD symptoms throughout my life. 

I may think I aced the test because for some reason unknown for me, I thought I needed to stay as still as possible or I would have to do it again. I also was nervous as hell before the test and I‚Äôm afraid I might have hyperfocused during the test. Also may or may not drank 3 cups of coffee before the test, which usually doesn‚Äôt have any effect on me other than getting sleepy‚Ä¶

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jb5wbh,https://i.redd.it/g3a69qih6ooe1.jpeg,"[ 0 YoE, Unemployed, Software / AIML Engr. , USA ]","Hello! Extremely cooked new grad (California, US citizen) targeting entry level positions, mostly for AI/ML, but also software engineer and full-stack or front end dev ^^; Sorry for incoming word salad!!!

Here is my most comprehensive resume and I swap things out / add more detailed info depending on the role :D I got 88 on Resumeworded with a variation of this resume. 

I‚Äôm seeking assistance w my resume because it looks like I‚Äôm not getting past the resume screen for almost anything haha..

Are there any skills I should pick up? Should I change my approach? Do I need to switch specialisations? I went a little too far down the AI/ML hole and I think I shot myself in the foot. Two Meta employees have told me to add a summary section but I‚Äôm not sure what to take out if I do orz

Additionally, there is a 3 month formal CS tutoring position not listed (yet) but I include it when filling out experience in job portals.

So far, though I haven‚Äôt really been keeping track so as to not totally destroy my morale:
* I‚Äôve probably applied to ~150 jobs since graduation under those titles (it‚Äôs on the lower end, working on it!! o7)
* 1 phone screen -> OA (recorded interview questions + leetcode question, passed all test cases) -> rejection
* 2 OA -> rejection

As for my approach:
* Basically any industry
* Applying both inside CA (up and down the stage) and outside but with heavier preference toward within. Willing to relocate
* Not yet talking to recruiters (I see some people do like coffee chats,, I need to work up the courage lol)
* No cover letter (I do have one but gave up hshjdhd)
* Autofill with Simplify + I give it another once-over
* If it‚Äôs a company I‚Äôm really interested in, responding to all optional/required free response questions with detailed answer (except additional information section of course). Never used LLM tools to write these
* Applying to roles not exceeding 2 YoE and where I meet roughly 70% of qualifications
* Not applying to any roles with MS or PhD required 
* Detailed job description sections when filling out portals
* Don‚Äôt care about high TC, as long as it‚Äôs livable

I think I kinda know why I‚Äôve been having such limited success, as I have been told / understand a few things going into this: I‚Äôm fighting a bit of an uphill battle because most MLOps positions are currently filled via connections and those with proven past experience in these roles (e.g. going from internship to full-time). And if not that, then the advanced degree holders tend to snap up the roles. I basically had no formal internship TuT (my own fault for not applying enough). Leetcode is also a huge barrier for me because I haven‚Äôt touched it beyond a handful of until after graduation (procrastination‚Äîbig mistake). Working on this and still getting the hang of easies/mediums right now! Lastly, NLP is in demand, and as you can see, there is like no NLP. I‚Äôm working on fixing this by reading and learning through hands-on projects/tutorials on the side! üòº

In the meantime, while I‚Äôm unemployed, I‚Äôve been
* Applying to and interviewing for local non-CS jobs. Also applying to IT positions when they open up
* Working on some personal projects: game project, creative writing web app, listen to music with strangers web app, that reading comprehension web app from a hackathon, personal website 

I would be okay with a career change I guess, in the worst case, but CS has been my dream major and SWE my dream career track since elementary school üôà I‚Äôve had a lot of setbacks along the way and fought my own brain to get here so I‚Äôm not giving up now! (hopefully LOL)

Sorry for rambling and thank you so much for your time if you got all the way to the end!

I've been using Sumatra beans with a medium, mostly dark roast. 

I have a Mr. Coffee grinder given to me by my neighbor, that supposedly has burrs. It's loud and annoying and a pain to get the grinds out. So now I use a tray underneath to contain the mess. 

While the kettle starts to boil, I grind the beans at just a few clicks above drip. I have it set on the shortest setting of two so that whatever I get in the hopper is what I use, which seems to be around a little more than one scoop from the scoop provided. That's my consistent form of measurement. 

Once the grounds are loaded I wait for the water to boil. Once it's at a good rage, I turn it off and let it cool off for about 30 seconds. Give or take. My daughter is usually asking me a question at that time about her lunch and what snack she's going to get so it's easy to get distracted. 

Then I pour up to a little bit above the two line. Let it rest for about 10 seconds and then stir it up front to back for about 10 seconds until I get a good froth. 

Then I put the plunger in just a little bit and pull back. It probably doesn't do anything but it's part of the routine now. At that point I go to put on my socks and shoes and help my wife finish making my daughter's peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Once that's done, which is around 3 - 5 minutes, I plunge whatever is left slowly for somewhere between 20 and 30 seconds. 

Add an equal amount of dairy and a little sweetener. Froth it with the battery powered wand. A few ice cubes. 

Sort of an iced cortado. 

And that's it. 

‚ÄúDialed in‚Äù.

DELICIOUS.

But I have to say that dating is so freaking exhausting. 100% of girls just sit there waiting for you to plan the dates, many of which expect something original and fun (can't do coffee dates God forbid that would be too low, as I've been told by some women). 

It's not easy to plan a date, especially for a guy that doesn't go out for activities that often (I grew up playing games and being a computer nerd, like many other men, not going to restaurants and doing activities). I have to find a place that is in reasonable distance to my place and their place, it has to be sweet enough, not too loud so we can talk, I have to pay for the date (because I don't want to come across as cheap and because it makes me feel more masculine), I have to find an alternative if she doesn't like drinks, I have to find a place that is not too expensive, I have to try to make it original, etc., like God damn. 

It's especially annoying how a lot of girls, on dating apps at least, just sit there and wait for you to do all the effort. Dry answers, late replies, basically just sitting there like they're some prize that I have to fight for. Fuck that. I mean, I'll still play the game, but seriously do any men actually enjoy this friction?  

It's interesting how we have put all gender roles under a microscope, but courtship and making plans and all that, well no that ought to remain for the men to do of course! ‚Äî How convenient. Hell, I would like to be taken out on a date for once lol. All I would have to do is show up and find my way home, how fun is that.

Meh, just a rant. I wish this process was less exhausting and more seamless. I guess I have to get better at this. I've been keeping a notepad where I take notes on places I can take girls to dates, categorize them by type and region, etc., but I don't think this will get more fun anytime soon.",1,1741963621.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

1jb5lee,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jb5lee/i_started_a_new_job_but_i_never_made_it_to_my/,"I Started A New Job, But I Never Made it to My Floor","So, I guess I‚Äôll start with saying that I wasn‚Äôt the best student. My parents were pretty patient with me until my senior year. I was barely passing. I was lucky to get the occasional C. By my surprise, and frankly my parents, I ended up graduating. Though as soon as I was no longer a high school student, my parents immediately put pressure on me to get a job. Instead, I foolishly decided to give community college a try. After 3 three years I dropped out and moved back in with my parents. This time I had to no choice. They demanded help with bills rightfully so. I was now 21. I had to get a job.



At first, I made accounts on all of the job offering apps that I possibly could. Everything I could find was either a job that I was completely unqualified for, or a job I just couldn‚Äôt handle working at. I searched for weeks, and I even applied for a few. Though I‚Äôll admit, by the end of it all, I sort of wanted a boring desk job. Mindless work to pass the time and getting paid for it sounded right up my alley. So, I started looking for exactly that. A normal, boring office job. 



One day when I was scrolling through social media, I came across a link. It was a corporate company that seemed to be advertising positions in their workplace. Curious, I clicked on it. It was everything I was looking for. A small cubicle with a computer typing in data. I should‚Äôve known it was too good to be true, but I went ahead and applied anyways. Within 45 minutes, I received an email offering an interview the next day at the office. Strangely, at the end of the email it read: ‚ÄúIf you arrive on time and dressed appropriately, the job is already yours.‚Äù Now I know that should‚Äôve been a warning sign, but I was over the moon. 



The next day I told my parents the news. Their ecstatic faces made me feel more confident than ever. I showered, did my hair, dressed in my best suit, and put on my best pair of dress shoes. I asked my parents for their opinion and their smiling faces and warm embraces said everything I needed to know. I felt good. Better than good actually, I felt great. I gave my mother one last kiss and headed out the door. The entire drive there, all I could think about was how I was about to nail the perfect job. Most of all, bring in some money for the first time ever. 



As I approached the building, it looked pretty typical. It was almost a high rise, but not quite. There were only a few cars in the parking lot, but I shrugged it off as it being an off day for the workers, and only managers or higher ups were working. Although, it was only 5:45 in the morning, so maybe everyone else was still waking up and getting ready. So I thought. I could not have been more wrong. 



I walked through the big glass doors into a lobby with floral wallpapering and vintage tile. It was startling and beautiful at the same time. It felt like I was taken back in time as soon my foot entered the building. While in awe, I knew I had to hurry as my interview was at 6. There was no lady sitting at the front desk. There was only a check in list. I simply signed my name and made my way to one of the four elevator. I tapped the up button and waited excitingly. 



The doors opened to an empty elevator with floral accents on the walls. I had never seen an elevator like it, and honestly thought it was a little cool. I examined the floor buttons and saw there was only 6. The building from the outside looked much, much bigger. Maybe 10 to 12 floors at the very least. My interview was on the 6th floor though, so I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it. 
I pressed where I needed to go and watched the old elevator doors shut. I listened to the creak that indicates the elevator is starting to move and all I could do was smile. Until I felt the shaft stiffen and the elevator stop.




**FLOOR 1**




I swear on my life, my own mother‚Äôs life, that I pressed that 6th floor button 30 times when I saw I was stuck on floor one. My biggest worry at the time was being late, and an outdated elevator breaking down was just what I needed at the time. After repeatedly trying to get the elevator to close and take me where I need to go, I decided I would find the stairs and make my way up through there. 



The first thing I noticed was the first floor had a completely different aesthetic. The walls were a pale yellow, and the floor made of shiny white linoleum. The entire floor has a light but distinct smell of something rotten. Not constant, but it came and went frequently. There was no desk, and only two doors at the end of an unsettling long narrow hallway. Thinking one of them had to be the stairs, I just randomly picked one. I decided to go through the left door first. 



It was a huge room. I‚Äôm talking big enough to be a living room in an upper-class home. But, it had no wallpaper. It was completely decorated in mirrors. Every single wall. No furniture, nothing. I gave it a quick glance until I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. It was a girl. A young girl. She had her head in her hands and appeared to crying. Until she lifted her head. Not only was just smiling, she was laughing without any facial movements. She just smiled.



I‚Äôve never been one to believe in that kind of thing. The paranormal or whatever you want to call it. So I bet you could guess what I did next. I ran the HELL out of there and bolted into the room just adjacent to it. My heart was beating so fast that it took me a minute to realize it was another elevator. I had never seen an elevator inside of a room, but I was scared beyond belief and wanted out of there. Now.



In my panic, I again hit the sixth button. I was sure I could still make it. The slight feel of relief I felt when the elevator started moving quickly faded as the doors opened onto the second floor. 




***FLOOR 2***




I clenched my teeth in frustration. If Im honest, terror as well. I slowly stepped out of the elevator and started examining my surroundings. 
This room was different. It was just one big open lobby with a little blue door all the way to the right. I didn‚Äôt want to. I promise you I didn‚Äôt. But, I had to. 



I walked past the deteriorating blue wallpaper and set my shaking hand on the doorknob. I slowly walked in. The room was again empty and vacant. Except one lonely window. I thought I saw my parent‚Äôs car, so I decided to take a look because I needed some support right now.



Then a faint lullaby started to play. Something my mother sung to me until I was 10. Even when I begged her too stop. I listened for a moment, and then it was gone. Instead, it was replaced by a blood curdling scream. Thinking something happened while when they were trying to park, I decided to look because it sounded like my mother was in pain.



It was indeed my parent‚Äôs car, but instead of them being outside the building, I was watching the car accident that killed my sister 15 years ago. Seeing her in that car happy and smiling, and then watching her getting taken away again shook me to my core. But what got me the most, was it was replaying over and over. And that scream was from my mother. The wails of losing a child.



Wanting to see literally anything else, I quickly spun around to leave. I was greeted by another open elevator. On the back written blood was, 




**‚ÄùTIME TO GO UP. UP. UP. UP.‚Äù**




I ran into the elevator, hit the sixth button and knew what was about to come. Well, I thought I did. I looked up, and saw the girl smiling in the faint reflection. That‚Äôs when I realized I had absolutely no idea what was about to happen. 




**FLOOR 3**




I bit my nails waiting for the door to open. All I wanted to do was leave. But every elevator was in a different space, and I could only go up one floor at a time. I waited for the inevitable. Then, the doors finally opened. I swallowed hard and began to observe the floor ahead of me. 



Everything was an unsettling green color. There was an office desk and one chair. It reminded me of an abandoned doctor‚Äôs office. I almost missed the door, because that too was also the same weird green. I just wanted to get this over with. 



As I entered the room, I immediately noticed a noise. It was a scratching kind of sound. Like mice in the walls, or someone scraping the wall with their nails. The rotten stench I smelled earlier was now stronger and more persistent, but only in this room. All four walls had black mold somewhere on them. I involuntarily gagged as I started to observe the room. 



Suddenly, I hear a knock at from the door behind me. There was a tiny peep hole through the door so, I took a look. Optimistic it was a person coming to finally help me, I peeped through the tiny hole. It was the girl, the same one with that insane smile. She was bloody, and her eyes were gone. There were only hollow sockets where they should have been. I spun around and put my back against the door. As I tried to catch my breath, I realized the once ugly green colored walls were now stained with blood. A lot of blood. My shoes sloshed around in the puddles of blood beneath me. Even if that girl was out there, I had to leave. 



I swung open the door, and there it was. The once ugly green wall across the small corridor had turned into an elevator. I stepped in and pressed where I needed to go. I held my breath as I heard the elevator shaft creaking and shifting upwards.



**FLOOR 4**



I was much less hesitant this time. When the doors opened, I immediately stepped out without a second thought. This floor was the tiniest one I had been too yet. As soon as you stepped out of the elevator, the door was right in front of me. There wasn‚Äôt a big open room with wallpaper or flooring, just a door. 



I slowly reached for the doorknob and walked inside. Instantly, I was back at my grandmothers funeral. My entire family seated, staring straight ahead and not saying a word. There was no crying or stories about how wonderful she was. Nothing. They just stared straight ahead. My grandmothers open casket was in the front. It was almost identical to her actual funeral, the funeral I missed. Everyone was being completely still and silent. 



I started to walk up to my grandmother‚Äôs casket. As I passed each row, the people that were seated seemed to break their neck to watch me. By the time I reached her casket, the entire room was staring at me, and they were all smiling with their heads turned 360 degrees. Their eyes felt like daggers, and I couldn‚Äôt help but to feel they wanted to hurt me. They looked like my family, but I knew they weren‚Äôt. The funeral happened 8 years ago. 



When finally looked down at my grandmother, she too was smiling. Her eyes were wide open, but she never blinked. Then all of a sudden she raised her right arm with her pointed her finger upwards. She never lost that creepy smile. I turned around to run out of the room, but everyone and everything was gone. All that stood in front of me was an elevator. It was already open. 


I stepped inside.




**FLOOR 5**




I rushed out of the elevator as soon as the door opened. I knew I had to play whatever game was  happening to me. I needed to get it over with. But this time, I stepped out and into my living room. The scratching sound I had heard earlier was ear piercing now.


My mother sat on the couch I had just seen earlier in the day. She was crying hysterically. As I got closer I realized this was the moment she found out my sister had passed away. One thing was different though. She was scratching our wooden coffee table. Hard. I watched as fingernails flew off of her fingers. After the tenth nail, and spun her head 180 degrees. She smiled that awful smile. Then she spoke.



***‚ÄùIt should have been you. Do you like seeing your sister bloody? Do you like that she can no longer see? Why wasn‚Äôt it you?‚Äù***



Finally, it dawned on me. This place is taking every traumatic event I‚Äôve had and replaying it but making it intolerable and misconstrued. Over and over again. The thought was fleeting and I just wanted the next elevator as soon as possible. 



Blood soaked the couch, the rug, my mother‚Äôs clothes, and the coffee table.  When I wiped my tears, blood soaked my hand. I slowly backed up and got ready to run. When I turned around, my living room was gone. I was now in the lobby again, except now there was no front door. 



I walked up the receptionist desk. It was still empty. I looked down at the sign in paper. I clenched my teeth and felt the stream of tears run down my face as I read the sign in sheet. The only name on there was mine with one tally mark. It read:




***‚Äú10 tally marks. Promotion on sixth floor.‚Äù***




I‚Äôve been here for two weeks, and I still only have one tally. If my parents see this, just know that I did everything I could.",3,1741963572.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
1jb5l8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jb5l8z/question_about_kenyan_dating_culture_and/,Question about Kenyan dating culture and expectations,"
I have a friend who moved to Kenya last year from the UK to settle and work on her family‚Äôs tea and coffee farms.

She‚Äôs said a few things to me about the dating scene and cultural expectations that I‚Äôm finding hard to believe. So I thought I‚Äôd come here to get some clarity. 

So she‚Äôs been dating and she says that moving in with a man essentially means that they‚Äôre seen as a married couple. Is this true? I know about come-we-stay relationships but I thought one would need to have been living together for years and even having kids to be considered equal to being a spouse. 

She says that by dint of having a ‚Äòhusband‚Äô, she‚Äôs been getting more respect and business dealings have been going a lot smoother. Men have been more respectful, not asking her out, etc. And women now see her as less of a threat to their relationships because she‚Äôs ‚Äòtaken‚Äô. 
She says that this difference in behaviour in palpable, and changed once she moved in with her boyfriend. Does this happen frequently to women? 

She moved in with her BF/husband despite living in a much nicer place because he couldn‚Äôt allow it to be known that he had moved in with her. Is this typical? 

She also is now responsible for all domestic tasks in the shared house and he pays for everything. Despite her working herself. He refuses to let her contribute but that means that there are months where she‚Äôs skint. 

FYI she‚Äôs Kenyan, and is Kamba/Kikuyu, and lives somewhere outside Nairobi.

I discovered I was pregnant on Feb 26th; I'd had what I thought was a light period on January 29th-30th-31st, but it turns out that must have been implantation bleeding. I thought I was only 10 days late for my period based on the timing of that bleed, but it turns out I was much further along. I hadn't had many symptoms except for very sore breasts, some tiredness and loss of appetite, all of which I tend to get before my cycle anyway, so I didn't clue in right away.

I'm in a solid, loving relationship, but we just aren't currently in a situation to add to our family. I have a young child from my previous relationship, and we live in a fairly modest apartment, and for many other reasons it just wouldn't be right to add to the family right now. 

I was a bit panicked when I found out I was pregnant, but my partner was incredibly supportive and understanding. I called my doctor the same day and was referred to our local hospital which has a program for women seeking termination. My partner brought me to the appointment, which was on Wednesday of this week. I'm based in Canada and so it was a very calm and non-judgmental environment; I'm grateful to the doctor and nurse who walked me through my options and explained everything to me.

I was given an ultrasound and blood test the same day and they determined I was at exactly 10 weeks and 0 days, the cutoff for using medical termination in my province. They mentioned I could either schedule a surgical termination for the following week, or do the medical termination as long as I was willing to take the first pill that day. I decided on the medical because I wanted to end the pregnancy as soon as possible - my last pregnancy and birth process were extremely traumatic, and being pregnant again was giving me nightmares and flashbacks, so I couldn't handle the thought of waiting any longer.

Timeline:

6:00 pm Wednesday: took the mifepristone dose as directed. Had some very mild cramping starting about two hours later, which continued the following day.

1:00 pm Thursday: developed a headache, had some additional cramping and mildly upset stomach through the rest of the afternoon.

6:00 pm: took 10 mg ketorolac with a small amount of food.

6:45 pm: took 4 Misoprostol tablets in the cheek for 30 minutes as directed, washed down with water afterwards.

9:00 pm: started having some mild cramping which came in waves, slight chills. Very mild nausea which didn't last. Watched TV with partner and just tried to relax.

10:00 pm: started having some light spotting, cramps continuing. Cramps felt like my worst period day, nothing too major. Chills and started to have diarrhea.

10:45 pm: listened to an audiobook and went to sleep.

11:30 pm: woke up to a strange sensation, felt almost like my hands weren't attached to my body. Felt something shift in my lower abdomen, then a rush of fluid. Fortunately I was wearing heavy duty period undies in addition to a pad already and had no leakage. Went to the bathroom expecting pure blood but discovered it was pink tinted fluid which I assume was water breaking. Pad completely saturated. Pain very minimal.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I felt something drop out. Had the sensation of needing to push, did so and a much larger clump came rushing out, along with quite a bit of blood. Peeked into the toilet and could see a ring shaped clot, and noticed a light pink thing partially submerged in the blood. It was not pleasant to see and I could tell it was part of a leg/lower torso of the embryo, extremely small but unmistakable.

Had a bit of a cry. Said I was sorry. Remembered what some of the other women have said on here about their babies becoming part of the water. I did not want to be pregnant, but I couldn't help but have feelings about it. I stayed for a while before saying goodbye and flushing.

1:30 am: woke up again, mild cramping and passed some more clots. Took a second ketorolac. Came back to bed and fell asleep easily.

6:00 am: woke up at my normal time, immediately felt different than I'd been feeling for the last few weeks. Breasts still a little sore but pain noticeably reduced from how they had been feeling prior. Did not have the morning upset stomach, and was able to enjoy a coffee (I'd been having aversion to it for about three weeks). Actually had energy as opposed to feeling extremely fatigued. Had moderate amount of blood on the pad and a few tiny clots when going to the bathroom, similar to a day 2 period.

10:30 am (present): cramps have almost completely subsided, have not needed more ketorolac. Ate some breakfast. Still have what is similar to a day 2 period. Energy is much higher than it normally is at this time of the morning.

I will still need to monitor for unusual bleeding, signs of infection, or increasing pain, and will need a follow up to confirm everything has passed, but ultimately the process was not what I expected. I originally worried that 4 Misoprostol wouldn't be sufficient, given that I was 10 weeks along and I've seen stories on here of women needing double the dose. I was worried it wasn't working initially as it took quite some time for the bleeding to start.

For anyone facing this situation right now: just know that you aren't alone. You are doing what is best for your body, and if you aren't ready to give up everything for a baby it means you're doing the right thing for your baby too.

I took a chance on her when at first I felt like I shouldn't due to some circumstances. The conversations and communication were too good, I had no expectations, everything felt too right, and we became each other's safe space among the bullshit that's happening around us all. We're both gay women but she lived in the closet and now we're separated because of that. I feel abandoned when we both worked so hard to be there for each other. 

I feel like I love so hard and even after 2 weeks I can't stop thinking about her and missing her. She's the sweetest and kindest girl I've ever met. She loved listening to my daily rants and helped me stay focused during the important moments. I realized she had everything I want in a partner.

I'm mourning and grieving the loss of her and our future, but at the same time still wishing she'd find me and come back. I'm hopeful and hopeless. This spiral is awful and a struggle to escape. I want to be whole again and find cuteness in the world like before. I don't want to cry every few hours because something reminds me of her. 

My healing journey has hit a wall I cannot seem to grow beyond at this time. It feels like the world is moving on without me and I'm sinking into a pit of despair.

I'm in between 2 caterers. One is a well known caterer and the other is a mom and pop, operates out of a shared rental kitchen. The mom and pop, we would ne able to afford the plated options but the bigger caterer we will have to go buffet. 
The bigger caterer provides actual China, a coffee bar and a lot of extras but is a couple grand more. 

Both caterers have some red flags...the bigger caterer i caught in a lie pertaining to my estimate. She said she sent it multiple times weeks ago but i never received an email...it seemed like she was trying to lie to cover her tracks. But her company is tied to one of the most well known restuants and wedding venues in the city.

The mom and pop rescheduled our intatial tasting and was late to the rescheduled time. He also made me slightly nervous about the delivery of the food...he doesn't have a warmer for the plated options (my venue doesnt either) so he would have to deliver it just before service....which in my mind has a lot of potential to go wrong.

Food from both is petty good. We do have a sentimental reason for choosing the bigger company if that matters 

Would you still work with the bigger caterer or switch to the smaller? I am afraid my bandwidth for going to a different tasting has dwindled.",2,1741963188.0,Weddingsunder10k,3,1.0,False

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù

Like everyone else I wear the damage of war. I told Maddy no new cases for a couple of weeks. That clears my schedule almost to Christmas. I wince as I get up. As usual I greet Chompy as I walk past and head towards the kitchen. I make an iced coffee and walk out to the patio. To my surprise Maddy is already out there smoking a blunt. I sit down.
‚ÄúSup.‚Äù

Maddy takes a hit and looks at me.
‚ÄúJesus, Betty. Are you all right?‚Äù

I breathe in the early winter air and say.
‚ÄúI will be.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook. I need details.‚Äù

During the invasion, Maddy covered with the gas leak story. Originally it was supposed to be for a couple of days but it went on for much longer. What worked in our favor was the fact there was minimal damage to downtown. The curfew kept everyone away and safe. I light my own blunt and start talking.
‚ÄúFirst. I want to thank you for coming. I know the extended time frame was hard to cover for.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell. It helped that the dead imp bodies and blood evaporated in the sun. If it wasn‚Äôt for that, well‚Ä¶.that would‚Äôve been a whole other story I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to cover up. How is everybody?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe took casualties. The gargoyles lost the most. Both The Pack and the Fangs lost a couple of people. Gor was maimed and lost an eye.‚Äù
I 
‚ÄúOh my god. Is he alright?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúOther than the eye, yes. He thinks he looks badass now.‚Äù

Ninja walks out and puts a fist against his palm and bows. His change has been drastic. Now battle tested, he feels like a true warrior now.
‚ÄúHey, Ninja. Can you go get Gor for me?‚Äù I ask.

Ninja nods and leaves.

‚ÄúWhat was that? The bow and everything.‚Äù Maddy says.

‚ÄúIn his mind he is a real warrior now. Can‚Äôt blame him. He was awesome.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are the rest of the gremlins?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. Some bumps and bruises. Snowflake thought he was at a play date or something. He legit just had fun.‚Äù I answer.

Gor walks out with Ninja.

‚ÄúOh my sweet baby. Come here.‚Äù Maddy says.

Gor walks over and Maddy hugs him.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

Gor grumbles.

‚ÄúHe wants to know if you think he looks like a badass.‚Äù I say.

Maddy holds his face and smiles.
‚ÄúOh yes. Very much so. You look very fierce.‚Äù

Gor smiles.

‚ÄúHey buddy. You good? Does the eye hurt?‚Äù I ask.

Gor grumbles.

‚ÄúCome here. Let me take a look at it. Just to be sure everything is good.‚Äù

Gor walks over and I inspect the eye.
‚ÄúWell. I‚Äôm not Aurora but it looks ok and not infected. I‚Äôll have Aurora look at it when she comes back.‚Äù

Gor nods.

‚ÄúWhere is our witch friend?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúStill fighting necromancers as far as I know. After day five, I didn‚Äôt have much time to talk with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas it going well?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúWell enough. They also had so,e losses but Aurora feels they will still win. I guess we will have to wait and see.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least we have won one war.‚Äù Maddy says.

‚ÄúYeah. Now we deal with the fallout.‚Äù

‚ÄúFallout of what?‚Äù

I relight my blunt and take a hit.
‚ÄúThe king showed up at the literal last minute. He was upset about the siege. Tilbault and general Amethyst have gone back to France for questioning.‚Äù

Maddy takes a hit and asks.
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Remember I‚Äôm just an ally. Onyx and Micah also don‚Äôt have to go. As far as the king is concerned, they were just following orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn. When do you think Thilbault will be back?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know. He said he would be. His mom, the queen is mad upset he put himself in that much danger. The saving grace with his dad is that all of his military decisions were sound and the king couldn‚Äôt really argue them. I think the king was secretly proud of his son.‚Äù

‚ÄúHas this affected our alliance with the kingdom?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs still on solid ground. But our town is of some importance in the gargoyle culture. Don‚Äôt be surprised if gargoyles start showing up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm just glad there has been no damage between us and the kingdom.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is one hitch however.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe relic that drew in the imps will be kept here uncovered. As a war trophy and to draw in any remains imps here to be destroyed.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they believe any more imps may show up?‚Äù Maddy asks.

‚ÄúNo. Merely a precaution. The gargoyles want to make sure that if any new imps show up in the world. They will come here and be destroyed. As mayor of the town, you need to know the relic will remain here.‚Äù

Maddy looks up and lets out a long breath.
‚ÄúOk. I trust Micah. If anything happens, I‚Äôm sure the kingdom will send the necessary soldiers. I‚Äôll talk to the advisors and see what they say.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like a plan. So how much damage was done to the town?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúSome. Not much more than a really bad storm. Everybody is buying the official story with a strong side eye of course. Thankfully and unbelievably no residents were hurt. Only some structural and infrastructure damage.‚Äù

I nod.
‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôve already talked to the king and David. Together we will pay for all the damage. It‚Äôs only fair.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. We don‚Äôt have enough people o4 taxes to pay for all of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe city won‚Äôt have to pay a dime.‚Äù I assure Maddy.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a relief. Thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe least we can do since we started a war in our backyard. David should be contacting you in a couple of days.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect. Is there anything else we should talk about?‚Äù Maddy asks.

I slowly shake my head.
‚ÄúNo. I believe that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. I got to go. I‚Äôll talk to you later.‚Äù  Maddy says as she gets up. She hugs my shoulders.‚Äù I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

Maddy leaves and I‚Äôm left with the boys. I take a hit and sip of my coffee.
‚ÄúSo, turds. What do you want to do today?‚Äù

Gor grumbles and Ninja chatters.

I think about what they said for a moment.
‚ÄúI like it. I‚Äôll grab a couple of briskets and we will have a victory dinner. Should I invite the Fangs and The Pack?‚Äù

They answer in their own way.

‚ÄúCool, cool. I‚Äôll do that. Can you two start with the preparations?‚Äù

They nod and take off. Shit. I‚Äôm inviting werewolves. Perhaps I should get four large briskets. That will be a game time decision when I get to the butcher shop. I pull out my phone and send out some texts. Since I‚Äôm going out in public today. Maybe I should shower and change. A half hour later, I‚Äôm walking downstairs and see Snowflake by the door.
‚ÄúGet up here you little asshole.‚Äù

Snowflake chatters as he jumps into my arms.

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm just going to get some food. I‚Äôll be back soon. Hey, I just wanted to say. You were awesome,e during the siege.‚Äù

Snowflake chatters.

‚ÄúCut the bullshit. Of course I needed you. Long before anyone else, it was just me and you. You are my best friend and I love you.‚Äù

Snowflake chatters.

‚ÄúGet the fuck out of here. You love me too. Say it.‚Äù

Snowflake chatters.

I start kissing him all over his face.
‚ÄúLove you, love you, love you.‚Äù

Snowflake wiggles and puts a claw on my face in an attempt to stop me from kissing him. We both know he could stop me if he wanted to. He secretly loves this. My kissing assault continues.
‚ÄúLove you, love you, love you,‚Äù

Snowflake puts his other claw in my face as he chatters.

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not going to stop until you say you love me too.‚Äù I say before resuming the kissing.

Snowflake chatters and I stop kissing him.

‚ÄúSee? Was that so hard?‚Äù

I hug him tightly.
‚ÄúLove you so much.‚Äù

I put him down and he walks away chattering.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bunch of bullshit and we both know it.‚Äù

I smile before opening the door and leaving. Sometime later I walk out of the butcher shop with five large briskets costing a small fortune. Apparently these briskets come from golden cows. Just as well, when it comes to werewolves. There‚Äôs no such thing as too much meat. Hell, they will barely touch any sides I make. Except for Holden. That dude loves green beans. I load everything up and side into the driver‚Äôs seat. I pat the steering wheel and say.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be careful we are hauling precious cargo.‚Äù

I get home and I‚Äôm pressed with a new problem. I stand there and look at the smoker as Tony walks up grumbling.
‚ÄúGot a problem.‚Äù

Tony grumbles.

‚ÄúWell. I got too much brisket and not enough smoker. I could squeeze in four but not five.‚Äù

Tony grumbles.

‚ÄúNah. Not enough time to smoke the fifth after I do the four. Shit.‚Äù

Tony grumbles.

I look at the grill now.
‚ÄúIn theory I could smoke the fifth brisket in the grill but that would be a pain in the ass. You know what? I‚Äôm going to cut the fifth brisket into basically steaks and grill them. We are dealing with werewolves. They are not picky. Yeah, that what we are going to do.‚Äù

Tony grumbles. I look at him with a raised eyebrow.
‚ÄúYou want regular brisket? Help me make it and you get first dips. We will call it chef‚Äôs tax.‚Äù

Tony smiles as he grumbles.

‚ÄúOk. Get the butcher paper and seasoning. I‚Äôll start prepping these bad boys.‚Äù

Tony takes off and I start getting everything ready. Tony and I make a good team. It wasn‚Äôt long before we had the briskets in the smoker and the fifth one cut up and ready on a plate. I hand the plate over to Tony.
‚ÄúPut this in the fridge.‚Äù

Tony grumbles.

‚ÄúNah. Since it won‚Äôt take as long to cook. We can wait till later to grill them up.‚Äù

Tony takes the plate inside.

I stand there and put my hands on my hips. Well, I got some time. Guess I should find something to do. The first thing is to have a snack, after I smoke a blunt. After all of that, I still have some substantial time to kill. Guess I‚Äôll watch a movie but let me take a walk first. I walk around the house and when I turn the corner. I see a black vehicle drive down the driveway, I stand there and watch it park and Wyatt get out.
‚ÄúHey motherfucker. You dare come here again?‚Äù I yell.

Wyatt puts his hands up.
‚ÄúNow hold on, sweetheart. I came to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have nothing to talk about.‚Äù

Wyatt smiles and waves his finger.
‚ÄúNo. In fact we have much to discuss.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis ought to be good. What do we need to talk about?‚Äù I ask. I left my hatchet by the smoker. I can call it if I need it.

Wyatt puts his hands in his pockets.
‚ÄúI might have went about this the wrong way. It seems to me that you might be a bit smarter than your mother. In hindsight, I should‚Äôve taken a whole different approach to you from the start.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo what end?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good question. How about all the wealth you can handle.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot interested. As you can see I don‚Äôt exactly live in a double wide.‚Äù

Wyatt laughs.
‚ÄúTrue, true. Fair enough. How about this. How about a partnership? That way we both get what we want.‚Äù

I snort.
‚ÄúWhat exactly are you proposing?‚Äù

‚ÄúA partnership. A true partnership. I collect things and sell them to rich people that are too stupid to know how dangerous the object is. You and your mom keep such objects away from the outside world. What I‚Äôm proposing is this. Let‚Äôs work together. You keep the truly nasty stuff. I sell the trinkets at an obscene price. We both win. I of course have shit that would turn your hair white. I‚Äôll give these objects to you to keep as a sign of good faith.‚Äù

I may not be as smart as my mom but I know that Wyatt is only here because he‚Äôs on the ropes.
‚ÄúHow about a counter offer? Give me all your shit and walk away.‚Äù

Wyatt laughs.
‚ÄúSweetheart, that‚Äôs not going to work. Listen, I‚Äôve been going toe to toe with your mom for two decades now. We‚Äôve both lost and we‚Äôve both won. Let‚Äôs you and I do things differently.‚Äù

I fold my arms.
‚ÄúLet me get this straight. I‚Äôm supposed to let you sell dangerous shit to unsuspecting people and let them get hurt. With the possibility of them calling me to take care of it.‚Äù

Wyatt claps his hands.
‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre getting it. I‚Äôve never thought about that angle. Sure, that will work. I‚Äôll work them and sell something. It goes sideways and they call me. I refer you to them. You go in and take the object and I‚Äôll just sell it to someone else and the process starts all over again. You see? Look how well we are working together already.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither my mom or I do this for the money.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúYou should. The easiest thing in the world is taking money from someone stupid. You show them something slightly exotic and they shove money in your face. Throw in a compelling story and they‚Äôll shove even more money to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot going to happen. We are done here.‚Äù I say.

Wyatt sighs.
‚ÄúSweetheart, that‚Äôs a shame. It really is. You need me. There are others like me out there. Sooner or later, they will come knocking on your door. I can protect you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI appreciate the offer but I‚Äôm going to decline.‚Äù

Wyatt reaches into his coat and pulls out a gun. I hold out my hand and my hatchet flies into it.

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a neat trick.‚Äù Wyatt says.

We stand there looking at each other. Waiting for someone to do something. Out of the corner of my eye I see a woman walk out of the woods. She is wearing a tight tank top, Daisy dukes and a mask that is make out of burlap that covers her lower face. She is also carrying a hand scythe like uncle Helsing.
‚ÄúWell, well. My granddaddy would call this a Mexican standoff. How exciting.‚Äù She says.

Wyatt looks at her.
‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends call me lady Helsing for obvious reasons.‚Äù She says as she holds up her scythe.

She‚Äôs a serial killer.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind, sweetheart. Me and my friend are having a private discussion.‚Äù Wyatt tells her.

‚ÄúDarlin. I‚Äôm here to make sure things stay civil.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually lady Helsing. Wyatt here was just leaving.‚Äù I say.

Wyatt looks at me.
‚ÄúI have yet to convince you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot going to happen.‚Äù I reply.

Lady Helsing takes a step towards Wyatt and he points his gun at her.
‚ÄúOne more step and your head disappears.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh bless your heart. You think that little thing is going to stop me?‚Äù She says.

‚ÄúI do. This conversation has run its corse so I‚Äôll take my leave. I‚Äôll see you soon, Illyria.‚Äù Wyatt says. He gets into his car and takes off.

‚ÄúThank you for your help but I really didn‚Äôt need it.‚Äù I say to lady Helsing.

She walks over and stands before me.
‚ÄúI know. Helsing wanted to make sure he didn‚Äôt pull any dirty tricks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou talked to my uncle? Where is he?‚Äù

Lady Helsing giggles as she brushes her long blonde hair off her shoulders.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Helsing can talk to us over long distances. World wide in fact. I thought you knew that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did. I was hoping he talked to you in person.‚Äù

Lady Helsing pats my cheek.
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the most precious thing. If he talks to me again. I‚Äôll let him know you‚Äôre looking for him. Don‚Äôt hold your breath. He has talked to me recently but before that. It‚Äôs been years.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. How does he know what‚Äôs going on here then?‚Äù

‚ÄúDarlin. Everyone of our kind that has passed through here has checked up on you. At Helsing‚Äôs request.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? How many of you have passed through here?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúNot many. Just a handful. Out of respect, few of us pass through here. This is his territory.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo. Uncle Helsing has been spying on me.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúLooks that way.‚Äù

I highly suspect he is doing it for mom‚Äôs benefit. Technically it‚Äôs Helsing but it‚Äôs really her that‚Äôs spying on me.
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶.ill tell you what. Every serial killer that passes by has to check in with me. Why spy when I can tell them directly what‚Äôs going on? That way they would have a more accurate account to tell my uncle.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, darlin.‚Äù

I fold my arms.
‚ÄúUncle Helsing is your god, correct?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes. You know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is the assumption among our kind, yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I know I‚Äôm not Helsing but I am one of the few people he is close with. Do you want to anger me and have me say something to your god?‚Äù

1jb599z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jb599z/question_about_kenyan_dating_culture_and_standards/,Question about Kenyan dating culture and standards,"
I have a friend who moved to Kenya last year from the UK to settle and work on her family‚Äôs tea and coffee farms.

She‚Äôs said a few things to me about the dating scene and cultural expectations that I‚Äôm finding hard to believe. So I thought I‚Äôd come here to get some clarity. 

So she‚Äôs been dating and she says that moving in with a man essentially means that they‚Äôre seen as a married couple. Is this true? I know about come-we-stay relationships but I thought one would need to have been living together for years and even having kids to be considered equal to being a spouse. 

She says that by dint of having a ‚Äòhusband‚Äô, she‚Äôs been getting more respect and business dealings have been going a lot smoother. Men have been more respectful, not asking her out, etc. And women now see her as less of a threat to their relationships because she‚Äôs ‚Äòtaken‚Äô. 
She says that this difference in behaviour in palpable, and changed once she moved in with her boyfriend. Does this happen frequently to women? 

She moved in with her BF/husband despite living in a much nicer place because he couldn‚Äôt allow it to be known that he had moved in with her. Is this typical? 

She also is now responsible for all domestic tasks in the shared house and he pays for everything. Despite her working herself. He refuses to let her contribute but that means that there are months where she‚Äôs skint. 

FYI she‚Äôs Kenyan, and is Kamba/Kikuyu. And lives somewhere outside Nairobi.

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks me and my Bf broke up. Our relationship was rocky since the start. I was 1 year single and did my share of healing from a previous not super good relationship. A friend of mine introduced us and at the first moment I was not interested as much. But HE started love bombing me and I was babysitting his dog cause he worked shifts as a waiter. Now already in the start he dropped his dog on me, I have my own dog who is well trained and a sweetheart and when we hit it off the first 3 months I spent re-training his dog who was chaotic at best. Now she was cute but I became a prisoner of my house, around 2 months into dating he moved in with me but did not take any responsibility for her much, just talked. At 3 months I was at the end and told him I want to breakup cause I understand he would not want to part with her but I can‚Äôt live like this. I worked from home so I had to take care of 2 dogs, training, my job, the apartment.. everything. He said he doesn‚Äôt want to break up and I figured out that the little pupper could live with his grandparents who were lonely. It worked out well.. after we stayed a family of 3 - him, me and my dog who he loved.. I noticed that when he was with me he always put his phone on DND. At first I trusted him that it‚Äôs cause of work but then one night someone called him. When I asked he said it was work.. now I do know a liar when I see one so I called him out and he gave in and told me it was his ex.. he called her back and yelled at her that because of her he has now issues with his GF (me). I told him it‚Äôs not because of her but because of his behavior.. now we sorted it out somehow but I did tell him that if he wants to lie he can go.. he didn‚Äôt want to and promised not to do that.. one night I saw his phones password and I just had this feeling.. so yes I looked into his phone.. texts from girls, a full library of p..n of his exes.. I called him out on that and told him to just leave that this is not okay.. he swore it was cause of his toxic exes and rests from when he was single etc.. me trying to be emphatic with his issues.. I gave in.. I stayed.. he drunk a lot every evening and at his BD he got really drunk had all kinds of fits and ended up running into the woods while his friends just laughed, we argued and he became really tough to handle where at one point I packed my stuff but his parent came and sorted out the situation. He stopped drinking after.. for me effort‚Ä¶ he cut off his friends completely even though the only thing I said was if you want to drink and do drugs or anything please don‚Äôt come home‚Ä¶ he said they are not real friends anyway and stopped talking to everyone. I asked him couple times if he doesn‚Äôt miss them cause everyone needs friends.. he always said I am his friend..later on  going forward I saw him messaging while I was working and got that gut feeling again.. so yes again I snooped.. at this point I started to be scared of his phone but found out that he was sexting on OF.. paying with money he didn‚Äôt have cause he was in debt.. we argued again and again even though me trying to explain how much it hurts me he swore ..he promised and blamed me that I am always throwing him out and turned it around on me.. in the end I was the one apologizing.. yes trust me I know how it all sounds I can‚Äôt believe still that I believed in him.. I started to work hard for our trips and bending my days for him, getting his finances in order.. he deleted his Fb, put his IG after he cleaned it of his history of girls - cause I said I do not want to be posted on his IG like a chain of GF, to private and swore he is not writing, sexting etc.. that was his effort. We went on a trip to florence where in the middle of the night around 2 am in the morning he got a text.. now again that gut wrenching feeling so I checked and it was some girl.. now I breathed through and sat into the kitchen and he woke up came to me so I asked him about it.. I always asked nicely the first time..he said it was ‚Äúno-one‚Äù. I blew up! I yelled and screamed and cried.. I had a full meltdown. We didn‚Äôt talk for the whole day after. Not once did he say anything helpful or reasonable nor did he apologize.. when I calmed down we talked and I again said he is free to leave cause I don‚Äôt want this.. he promised he swore of course, I tried to believe as he told me no one ever told him this is important, he didn‚Äôt think the girl is important he wanted to avoid conflict. I started to be really on edge with his phone, but he was trying to ease my worries and when the girl wrote him again he was like I have no idea what to respond could you do it. I was surprised but I was like okay.. I wrote a very polite and nice message but in the end he blocked her. He got jealous and had fits when I got friend requests or anything of that sort so I limited my socials too just to ease his mind.. does it sound toxic? Yes but I believed it‚Äôs all part of what he never had and that I can help.. somehow showing him he can trust me. What I didn‚Äôt notice is that I started to be depleted.. taking care of everything - he was very sex oriented so we had sex like 20-25 times a month which I had to push myself into sometimes, but I felt tired.. he was very on edge when we did not have sex for 2-3 days, and I was about to move into my own apartment I bought.. he helped me with a lot of stuff but all the money was on me as it was my place.. and I started to push that he has to start saving money too, then he lost his job.. he told everyone it was mutual but I knew better. I helped him and within 2 months he found a new job.. I helped him financially and even with vacations we wanted to go on etc.. every day started to be a fight for me though I was worried, stressed and always questioning what he is doing, who he is writing.. the whole trust didn‚Äôt come back but he never tried to help me out with transparency.. he had new girl co-workers.. he didn‚Äôt even want to call them by their names.. I called him out on that again and cried and told him this is messing me up. I told him it‚Äôs making me paranoid and feel like a crazy person and that is not me! He said he will do his best to avoid it.. there were more incidents like this but I stopped paying attention, eventually I disassociated from his phone and told myself I am gonna trust him.. I was fighting myself, brought it couple times to him to tell him I am worried and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.. he promised he is not doing anything and he is not writing to any girls.. he was always very specific with his words.. now to roll to the recent events. We had a rough patch as his salary went down by 1k.. he still made a solid 2k and his expenses were around 800, somehow he could not save up. I stopped at one point going over his bank statements cause I wanted him to learn to manage his own money but we started to think to buy something together. In the end I said I can‚Äôt cause I am worried as I lost everything in my previous relationship- my home, my dog etc. but honestly I put a 5k down payment on a waiting list, I just didn‚Äôt tell him cause I wanted proof he can save at least 50 a month.. my dog got sick and we didn‚Äôt sleep properly for 5 days.. of course we didn‚Äôt have sex cause we were exhausted from it but one evening when he said he is tried and I was like sure let‚Äôs go to bed he blew up on me that since when does tired mean we won‚Äôt have sex.. I blew up cause I couldn‚Äôt believe he is blaming me when I am supportive so he can sleep properly.. we didn‚Äôt talk for 2 days almost after..then when we patched up and had sex I openly asked him if he really managed without porn etc and he told me I am all yours.. I knew he is kying but I left it that he needs space.. the day after his old best friend contacted him, they were not on talking terms for 2 years.. she wrote him in the morning when he was driving to his work and was messaging me but didn‚Äôt mention it.. he called me around lunch and I told him openly like I always did that my ex is just now writing me about his recent marriage where he countered with ‚Äúyeah my girl friend bestie wrote me in the morning‚Äù.. I got disappointed cause I asked  why he couldn‚Äôt tell me when it happened when he was writing me all morning.. like why is it so hard if he knows what I am going through, he got angry that he would have told me in the evening! I was resigned with maybe you would maybe you wouldn‚Äôt how do I know.. you swore before you will not be driving your colleagues home and when you did you didn‚Äôt pick up the phone with an excuse you were worried I will say something like ‚Äúi am waiting in the shower‚Äù in-front of your colleague (i never said things like that when we called). He got annoyed that it was just his male colleague and I told him every time you have a chance to prove that what you are telling me is true.. you don‚Äôt. I hung up and we didn‚Äôt talk for 2 days as he worked.. we saw each other in the mornings but we didn‚Äôt talk. When he came home that evening first question was ‚Äúwho did you talk to about it‚Äù I said no one.. I always looked for support in my friends and what I can do better but he didn‚Äôt like when I wrote my friends.. he also used to blame me when I deleted messages even though I told him openly which convo I am going to delete - it was mostly guys. We got again into a huge fight, where I yelled and bitched and cried and I was desperate, he swore he will help me fix it cause he knows he didn‚Äôt until now. We went to bed exhausted. The next morning I woke up and made my coffee and his phone was on the table so I opened it.. in the deleted pics was a porn picture with the title ‚Äúcheating on my gf with xyz‚Äù. i closed it and just sat there. He woke up and saw me and asked what‚Äôs up.. I told him to make his coffee and sit down. He did, so I opened the picture on my phone and calmly asked him if this is a joke on me and if he was sending it to someone.. he said he has no idea what it is and then threw his phone to me and told me to show him where I found it.. I prayed that he says anything but starts denying again.. he said he is gonna fix it.. as soon as he did that I snapped and blew up on him like a madman. i lost it! He told me he was super careful not to mention porn when I asked him about it that time.. I laughed I was like I am happy you can be careful about that but you can‚Äôt tell me the truth? He said he was ashamed and I told him I am done. I felt defeated,tired, stressed and utterly drained. I wanted him to even after all that tell me he loves me and hug me and say sorry I panicked.. I am gonna ask for help.. ANYTHING! But he said ‚Äúokay‚Äù. I left and deleted every picture and called my best friend to cry like an idiot.. when I came back he said he found an apartment to which I told him I want him out asap. He got mad that again I am throwing him out.. he was supposed to work all weekend so he said he will let me know. I was surprised he found something so quick but I was crying in bed when he came back home and started to tell me he loves me and that it‚Äôs gonna be for the best and how lucky I am to have my own place cause he will live in a one bedroom apartment now which is super old but can‚Äôt afford anything else. He left me there crying and went to work the next day. He wrote me he loves me but it‚Äôs on me cause he can‚Äôt be the man I want and that he can‚Äôt fix this anymore, that I want too much from him. In the evening I blamed him that he promised to fix it and he is just go in up.. he said he will not ask for another chance anymore cause he doesn‚Äôt want to and I cried.. I asked him to stay but not like this something needs to change and told him to sleep in the bed. He was holding my hand the whole night and woke up to tell me he is leaving anyway. I started to pack his stuff that day and cried constantly, writing him paragraphs of why he did this to me, why he always promised etc. I was a sad excuse of a woman, on the last day when he got off work he came home to pack and I started to be angry. He was still saying how much he loves me and asked me to tell him I love him too but I couldn‚Äôt. I told him if he closes that door I never want to see him again. He did and told me it‚Äôs on me.

So, how do I start? Hmmm, recap na lang muna tayo to last year.

Surprise! Nag iwan ako ng v-day gift sa chair mo. So you asked if may meaning ba yun. Sabi ko usap tayo so yeah nag usap nga tayo and I answered with yes may meaning. Sabi mo naman na hanggang friends lang talaga. Tinanong mo ko kung ipupursue ko ba kasi if yes then di mo na ko papansinin. So sabi ko, I-let ko lang yung feelings na to mag flow and malay ko in the next coming months mawawala din.

Di ko rin talaga plan mag pursue that time dahil i think it was not the right time, like nasa ""I want to get to know you more"" na stage pa ko. Even now, I want to get to know you more. Pero ayoko rin mag sinungaling at sabihin na walang meaning yun gift tapos magcconfess din pala sa future hehe.

So after that, as months go by less and less na ko nag interact sayo specially by chat. Di na rin ako tumatambay sa lobby kapag uwian time na, umuuwi na ko kaagad. Dati tambay pa ko para makita ka haha.

I tried to deny these feelings kasi baka temporary lang to.

Fast forward to today, wala epek dahil ikaw parin hahaha. Walang nagbago ikaw parin araw araw. Not a single day na di ka nag cross sa mind ko. Kahit na I keep myself busy sa paglalaro or panonood ng anime.

Yes, I liked you for almost two years na, and I think I've been in love for more than a year na. Di ako naniniwala sa love at first sight (college). Pero. I think sa second sight (work), yes? hahaha



""Single ka man, Single din ako. tayo na lang kaya?""

Sa line na to na pabiro ko sinabi, kasalanan ko pa nag karoon pa ng ship na gawa nila hahah pero gusto na kita nun.

Then one day, it was a friday of \[month\], nag \[eat somewhere\] tayo lahat after work. Dun ko naramdaman yung sabi ni Zack Tabudlo na ""pag nakikita ka na, bumabagal ang mundo"". Though di bumagal ang mundo pero I felt something like in my heart hehehehehehe. Naka OOTD ka pa nun naka black na parang polo pero maiksi tapos may necklace at makeup konti, napasabi pa ko ng DAMN. Hahah

So, after nun i tried finding more ways and reasons to connect to you. Specially nung break puro na ko chat sayo kahit di ka nagrereply masyado hahaha. Nag rereact pa ko sa chat para lang mag notify, di ko alam if nag notify ba. Kaya yung chat natin every reply ay 3-5 chats hahaha.



Napagawa pa ko ng playlist dahil di ko maexplain ang nararamdaman ko, di ko man lang naipakita sayo nung we had the talk.

But here it is:  \[redacted spotify link\]



And fast forward dun na sa gift, and sa usap natin. Alam mo ba during usap natin dun sa \[coffee shop\] may parang faint reflection ng light sa mukha mo though di siya malakas kasi syempre mapapansin mo yun silaw sa mata mo.

Nakikita ko yun parang heart shape na liwanag sayo hahahaha. Pero promise no joke nakita ko talaga yun. Napaisip ba ko if yung universe nag bibigay sakin ng sign.



And I think it is. 

Dati nakakakita ako ng mga patterned numbers like 11:11 sa orasan pero rare lang, then last year di ko na mabilang sa isang month ilang beses ko nakikita yun dahil padalas ng padalas na. Umabot ako sa point na sinearch ko ano meaning bat lagi ko na nakikita ang ganun. Angel number daw or something about synchronicity. Nasa tamang lugar or path daw ako ng life ko.

So sinasabihan ba ko ng universe na ikaw na yung the one? Kasi sinubukan ko tumaya ng lotto, wala man ako nanalo hahahaha. Dalawa lang kasi pumapasok sa isipan ko everytime nakikita ko yung mga number2 na yan. Syempre yung first ay ikaw, then second yung pera hahah.



So yeah, as a socially awkward na introvert andaming nangyari na first para sakin. Mga bagay na di ko maiisip na kaya ko palang gawin. Isa na dun is yung mag confess personally, and its with you. Second is may plano2 pa ko na pumunta at mag surprise nung bday mo kaso fail kasi wala ka pa sa bahay nyo that time. hahaha

I don't know how this works after a confession dahil I've never been in this type of situation since high school.



Pero ito ang sure ako.

I like you. I have always liked you. And I will always like you no matter what happens.



Everytime nakikita kita, tinatamaan ako, kahit anong style mo, naka clip yung hair, naka tali man, naka headset man wired or wireless, naka glasses man or naka hoodie. Ganda!



I may not have done or shown anything lately. Because I was holding myself back.

Welp, I won't stop anymore, can't stop anyway because now the fire in me has been reignited

 ...is what I was supposed to say.

I‚Äôve been there, I was figuring out how to handle the end of my own relationship. The first days were hard, my routine felt off, my thoughts were all over the place. But now, things are starting to settle, I‚Äôm finding my way again, coffee in the morning, quiet evenings to think, time with friends who remind me I‚Äôm not alone. What‚Äôs changed? It‚Äôs not just time, it‚Äôs the simple steps I‚Äôve taken to focus on what I can control, to move toward a better place. I‚Äôm here to share those steps with you, because they might help you too.

**The Challenge of Change**

Breakups can shake your sense of identity, making you question who you are without that relationship. You might have seen yourself as part of a team, a partner, someone whose daily life was tied to another person, now, that picture feels unclear. In those early days, I found myself stuck, going over every moment, wondering what I could have done differently, but also asking, Who am I now, without this part of my life? The emotions, sadness, frustration, worry, felt heavy, like something I had to push through. And then there were the bigger questions, How do I move on from what‚Äôs gone? How do I rebuild when I feel so unsettled, so unsure of myself? Maybe you‚Äôre feeling some of this too, the weight of change, the worry of losing the person you thought you were, the challenge of imagining a life that feels steady again. It‚Äôs normal to feel unsure, to focus on what‚Äôs missing. But here‚Äôs something to consider, you‚Äôre not alone in this, this time of change can be the start of something positive, if you approach it in a way that works for you.

**Three Simple Steps to Move Forward**

Through my own experience, I‚Äôve learned that moving forward isn‚Äôt about waiting for things to get better on their own, it‚Äôs about taking small, intentional steps to focus on your own well-being, to change how you see your situation. I‚Äôve put this into a simple, clear three-step process that‚Äôs helped me find some calm in the storm. These steps aren‚Äôt just for getting past a breakup, they‚Äôre tools for handling any challenge, whether you‚Äôre working on yourself or thinking about future relationships.

Here‚Äôs how you can try them:

1. **Notice the Signals (Understand Your Emotions)** Emotions like sadness, frustration, or worry aren‚Äôt problems, they‚Äôre signs, pointing to what matters to you. When I felt upset after my breakup, I realized it was because I cared a lot about being understood, feeling valued. Instead of letting these emotions weigh me down, I started seeing them as hints. For example, if you feel worried about being on your own, ask yourself, What is this worry showing me? Maybe it‚Äôs pointing to a need for confidence, connection. The key is to name the feeling without letting it take over. Try this, Next time a strong emotion comes up, write it down, ask, ‚ÄúWhat is this trying to show me?‚Äù This small change can help you turn confusion into clarity, giving you a bit more control.
2. **Stick to Your Goal (Focus on What Matters)** Moving forward needs a clear direction, a goal to aim for. For me, it was about being honest, growing. When thoughts like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never find someone else‚Äù came up, I‚Äôd ask, What do I really want to focus on? My answer was building a life that feels steady, not empty, a life where I trust in my strength, ability to grow. This goal guided my actions, like choosing to speak up instead of holding things in, or setting boundaries instead of holding onto the past. Ask yourself, What do I want to aim for? Is it self-kindness, peace, creating healthier connections? Write down your goal, let it guide your choices, even when worry or doubt show up. Remember, feelings come and go, but your goal can be your steady guide.
3. **Speak and Question (Change Your View)** Keeping emotions inside or letting them spill out without purpose can make things harder. Instead, say your feelings clearly, question the stories your mind tells you. For example, after my breakup, I caught myself thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to trust someone again,‚Äù which made me feel worse. But when I said it out loud, ‚ÄúI feel scared to open up,‚Äù and questioned the story, I realized my thought was just one way of seeing things, shaped by my own doubts. The truth was more complicated, maybe trust is possible, but I need time to heal and set clearer boundaries. Try this, Next time a negative thought grabs you, say it out loud or write it down, then ask, ‚ÄúIs this really true? Could I see this another way?‚Äù This practice can loosen the hold of harsh stories, helping you focus on what‚Äôs real, possible.

**Your Path to a Steadier Future**

I‚Äôve realized something helpful, this ending isn‚Äôt just about loss, it‚Äôs a chance to build something new. A full life isn‚Äôt about having more, it‚Äôs a way of thinking, a space filled with possibility. For me, it‚Äôs waking up trusting that I have enough inside me, strength, hope, the power to grow. It‚Äôs knowing that even in change, I‚Äôm not less, I‚Äôm free to build a life shaped by what I choose, not what‚Äôs gone. Relationships taught me that thoughts, communication, personal habits are parts to work on, both within myself, with others. By working on them, I‚Äôm rewriting my story, one where I‚Äôm not defined by what‚Äôs lost, but by what I‚Äôm free to create.",3,1741962432.0,Mindfulness,1,0.81,False

One day the board seemed to show a display error (MSI RTX 3060 ventus) WHITE LED  status and would not boot. No beeps, no BIOS screen. Just black screen and the white status led.  I had been noticing artifacts during gaming sessions, so I believed the diagnostic indication.

Except that it did- eventually.

After racking my head for hours,  I went for coffee, and when I came back, Windows was up.  After some experimenting, I noticed the board took about 2 minutes to start the boot process.  More experimenting, flashed to 7D25v1K, and I  start getting MBR fails.  Hard reset button corrects the issue for a handful times, then boom, no more Windows.  Every single repair option in the Windows DVD- short of a full reinstall - fails to bring back a booting box.

I try reinstalling from a USB stick- and the blasted UEFI boot order is not recognized. OK, this is getting too long. The cause for the White diagnostic led was a failed old SATA Seagate drive. I removed it and the system started booting windows setup from the DVD media.  Not from USB though.

**Issue 2**: M.2 drive incompatibility

I decide to switch my boot device to the M.2 stick. But the board absolutely ignores USB install media. Tested Good USB thumbdrives. I go to the advanced boot menu and force the boot order and the board laughs it off. I switch UEFI off and the same result. It does boot  from the original DVD, so I give up and do that.  I had to tinker with UEFI setup a few times until it recognizes the Crucial M.2 stick AND the IGD vs PEG stuff for the rdx 3060 card .  After Windows is installed, **the Intel 225V onboard NIC will not be recognized by ANY of the drivers.**

At this point I'm out of time and patience. I yanked out the M.2 stick, shove in an even older 500GB Seagate SATA mechanical drive, and windows sets up, boots, and both the  RTX 3060 and the NIC are recognized fine and dandy.  I can't help but conclude that the issue revolves around shoddy work on the M.2 integration.

It's not my job to test Microstar International hardware, so I won't test any other M.2s . But I would recommend you stay away from those while you own this board. It's not worth the hassle.

1jb50vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilFerret55/comments/1jb50vs/march_14th_2025_segunda/,March 14th 2025; Segunda,"So I'm a sad boi today indeed.

Today would have been my ex-wife and I's 8 year marriage anniversary.

How do you deal with all of this?

How do you deal with a betrayal caused by fear, lies, and manipulation?

I don't know. I'm trying. I swear I'm trying.

How do I deal with my ex-wife; so kind, so caring, so patient with everyone BUT me?

To put it simply;

How do I keep going? I go back to work tomorrow, so there will be some normalcy, but then I have to be near the people who lied and manipulated someone incredibly important to me and who, honestly, I loved with my soul.

S is such a good person, even with the trauma she's been through. I'm really leaning towards the 'She was lied to' thing more than the 'she lied' thing.

I've been in <town> five times since I moved. Once, to make sure my paperwork was done correctly for work and to grocery shop. It was a Saturday. I remember seeing her for a second and she just looked so terrified. So terrified. Of me. I want to know why, but I can't approach her. I don't want to scare her more. I just have to deal. I just have to cope. This is why we drink. This is why we pop pills. It's not good, but it's needed.

Second time was the following Monday to talk with J. Asked J ONE question; Is S doing okay? Then just talked about other stuff with J. How I was doing. I underestimated her, I was honest with her and said 'Hey, if you don't have any interest in talking to me again, that's completely okay, can you just please be upfront with me about it?' She said that was fine, but then I get a call from the cops a few days later saying that I'm harassing S's friends and following her and stalking her. And that's, uh, that's when the drinking started, to be honest. That's when the pills started.

Third time was the 9th, when I saw her walking into Hoden and I just absolutely bailed out. Was kinda excited to eat there, but I didn't want the drama, and I didn't want to scare her. Seriously, if I truly was such a CREEP, why would I be going out of my way to stay away from her? Going out of my way to NOT visit places that I know are her haunts? NOT going by her place when I'm doing a doordash in her neighborhood and going around?

Fourth time was the 11th, when I went to my insurance broker in downtown <town>. Had to make sure the insurance was split. Swung by the coffee shop to get a coffee. Come out to the car alarm going off. Been getting a lot of private callers late at night. Car has been egged. Car has been keyed. But, no one cares when this stuff happens to guys.

Fifth time was the 12th, and I've talked about that in the daily journal post.

How do I prove a negative? Especially when I can't present the evidence to the person who believes I'm doing that thing? How do I cope with that knowledge?

I carry the hospital bracelet around with me. Just hoping that she will approach and I can show it to her. I have a picture of the EKG results in my phone for the same reason. I have some things called 'Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block' and 'Anterior fascicular block'.   
  
How the IRBBB was explained to me was; ""The right side of my heart has a delay in receiving the messages to beat."" 

And the Anterior Fascicular Block... well, they said it looks like I had a heart attack. Which they said was 'very surprising, given my health.' Apparently, while I do carry some extra weight, my cholesterol is fine, my labs look good. 

Except for the massive amounts of muscle relaxers and opiates I had in me. 

It's crazy. When you take a lot of meds that relax your muscles, it also relaxes your heart. Because it's a muscle. 

Alas, this is my life now. I've been writing more. Reading more. Singing more. I realized that my voice is very good to harmonize with singers, not so good on it's own. Ah well. Might post the stuff anyway. It's fun.

Making brownies for work tomorrow. Cooking doesn't bring joy or anything, I havent been happy since January, but it... eases it a bit. Like taking ibuprofen for a kidney stone. It certainly won't even take the edge off, but, it does try to do something.

Another day to live through.

I'm tired. I'm so tired. It might be time to go, guys.

I'm still fighting. I'm still going.

But I'm not used to being \*this\* alone.

Better get to it.",1,1741962044.0,EvilFerret55,0,1.0,False

**April 19**,

A gentleman in a wheelchair rolls in. He is very distinguished.¬† I wave. I have seen him in a few times but never gotten to serve him. And boy do I want to!¬† Today will be my chance.¬† I look especially forward to this.

‚ÄúGood day, good sir. What would you like to drink?¬†¬† ‚ÄúLondon Fog Latte with whole milk.‚Äù¬†

I nod and put the order it. ‚ÄúWhat shall we call out when your drink is ready?‚Äù

He smiles at the phrasing. ‚ÄúSkerrit.‚Äù¬† I nod. Once I have it entered, he tells me ‚ÄúYou do not disappoint.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is our duty and privilege not to.¬† Especially for such a fine gentleman.¬† University professor?‚Äù

He looks a little surprised. ‚ÄúHistory.¬† Specifically Mediterranean history.‚Äù

I smile at him. ‚ÄúLittle on the nose, considering.‚Äù¬† My wink lets him know. He laughs.

‚ÄúWhat gave me away?‚Äù

I shrug. ‚ÄúThe chair is big. A little glamour to keep people respecting it and a centaur can chill on it, and no one will notice.¬† Also, when I was checking for names on Courts your name came up. Hard one to forget.¬† ESPECIALLY when I found out Skerrit the Forest Walker **was my landlord..**.¬† The manager somehow kept that one quiet from me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I will be, I lost that bet.‚Äù¬† He laughs and I find it is a warm and caring one. He is fast approaching the ‚Äúsafe to hang out with‚Äù list for me.

His drink up, he goes over to a booth and begins talking with Connie.¬† She is nodding vigorously.¬† I smile.¬† Even if they are a Dryad and a Centaur, people watching is a great perk of this career.

¬†

**April 29**

It‚Äôs my least favorite day in April. I gave myself a light day, just 3 hours to do bookkeeping and other similar work. I step out and open my umbrella. Rain is light, but I am not in the mood to get damp.¬†¬† Walking onto the lot I see Connie by her tree. She is talking with some kids.¬† They all have raincoats while she is wearing her jacket and dress. They are showing her something in their phone.¬†¬† She is smiling and I am glad she is enjoying the day. I head home.

I get on the bus, and I look at my phone. Every year, I open my messages.¬† Every year I look at the one to my mom. ‚ÄúHi mom.¬† Still alive.‚Äù¬† Every year I see all of them have been left on read. No response.

I mean how is this different than her ignoring my birthday cards every year?¬† Every July I send one. She gets them. I know she does. Jan from across the street knows she does.¬† She never writes back.

‚ÄúHi mom.¬† Still alive. Actually happy.‚Äù¬† *Should I add this?¬† It is true‚Ä¶*

My thumb hovers over send. Do I change things and potentially cause her to pick a fight?¬† Well, fuck it, I **am** happy.¬† My button hits the send button.

The message goes from delivered to read almost instantaneously.

Oh boy. Dots appear. *FUCK!*

‚ÄúI am glad one of us is. Happy birthday, I suppose.‚Äù

*Deep breaths, Pat*.¬† ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen are you coming home and making up with him?‚Äù

I steady myself. ‚ÄúNot sure on the first part. Never on the second.‚Äù

‚ÄúCoward.¬† You should have fought harder.‚Äù

Baiting me?¬† Seriously?¬† ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot hard enough.‚Äù¬† She is still in denial.

I am shaking. I can‚Äôt do this. I need to go.¬† I let her win.

¬†

Maybe it is my imagination or the adrenaline from this situation, but I feel someone watching me. I look around. Nothing. The nagging feeling continues. Aside from some older women, a kid glued to his phone, 3 or 4 business people in their own worlds, and me there is no one here.

I get off the bus and head into my hole in the wall. Walking in I see there has been what looks like a tornado in the living room. I pick up her stuff, get it so we don‚Äôt have trip hazards and start lunch.

TV and sammiches. Good day.

Jackie walks in to see me cross legged on the futon watching tv and being chill. She walks up behind me and puts her head on my shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Ricardo?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is out of town on a work thing.‚Äù¬† If I had told him what today was he would have cancelled and it would have hurt his finances.¬† I couldn‚Äôt do that to him.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too bad.¬† Home all day?‚Äù¬† I am on high alert, she is up to something.

I nod. ‚ÄúYea. Light day. I like them sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou like them on your birthday, you mean.‚Äù *She knows?!!!*

I slowly turn my head. There is no way to deny it while she is holding up a picture of my ID on her phone.

‚ÄúWhy do you have that?‚Äù¬† I saw the date taken. It was from more than a year ago.¬† I bet she took it when we were sorting out personnel records.¬† That stinker.¬† I remember she gave me a hug and took me out to dinner after work to ‚Äúcelebrate her being done with finals‚Äù or something last year.¬† It was the first time I had been out with someone on my birthday in years.¬† I didn‚Äôt thank her, but it helped a lot.¬† ‚ÄúYou hadn‚Äôt finished finals last year, had you?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I had. Just happened to be a happy co-inky-dink!¬† When I realized you weren‚Äôt going to celebrate you, I gave you something else to celebrate.‚Äù¬† She put her bag down. ‚ÄúI am done with studying, it is Saturday, and you need cake!‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease no. Whatever you are doing, let me be.‚Äù¬† I guess I sound pathetic as she immediately sat down next to me and looked at me. I could see some sadness there.¬† Her expression was concern more than anything. ‚ÄúTalk, Pat.‚Äù

‚ÄúAside from 3 I can remember, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have good birthdays.‚Äù¬† I am rubbing my scar and I catch myself doing it a split second after she does. Fuck. The look I get says she figured it out. She should not look that sad on my account.¬† ‚ÄúLook, I usually like being alone on them and chilling. Can I do that?‚Äù ¬†*I don‚Äôt want to be alone. But I am going to be terrible company and you should be out having fun!*

She frowns at me. ‚ÄúCompromise?¬† We go to a place for dinner that is nice and quiet and just us. We have some cake either store bought or from there. Movies after?‚Äù¬† *I love this wonderful woman.*

‚ÄúOkay.¬† Not going to bake me a cake, though?‚Äù¬† She laughs at that.

Shaking her head as she picks me up, she says ‚ÄúYou just said you don‚Äôt have good birthdays and you want to have me give you a case of food poisoning?!‚Äù¬† Oh yea, her last cooking attempt that wasn‚Äôt in the microwave almost started a fire‚Ä¶

¬†

We are walking down the street after a good meal towards a store I know has good cake when I feel an animosity towards me hit like a ton of bricks.¬†¬† I slow down as I look and I cannot see anything other than the usual assortment of people.

We go in and I can‚Äôt shake this feeling. Something bad is waiting for us. I decide to get my dummy wallet out. It has a credit card, $10 in cash and an expired ID card from Georgia. ‚ÄúJackie, do you have a decoy wallet?‚Äù¬† She looks at me like I am speaking a foreign language. I sigh.¬† ‚ÄúDo you a wallet that has stuff muggers would consider valuable enough to take while being easy to deal with losing?‚Äù

She looks at her little purse. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

As we are shopping I help her pull out her bank card, most of her credit cards, her ID, phone and other items. All she has left in it is some easily replaced make up, a little cash and an old library card. One credit card is left in there as well. Better to offer it up as a sacrifice if they go looking quickly.

We buy our cake and head out. Halfway down the block he stops us. Knife out, hand waves for our stuff.¬† I grab my dummy wallet, and I make a show of putting it in Jackie‚Äôs purse.¬† She gives her purse to him and he bolts.¬† Jackie looks at me.¬† ‚ÄúYou fucking psychic now?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know. But that feeling of animosity changed. I think the feeling is smugness. Jackie must feel it to because she turns and looks around.¬† I don‚Äôt see anyone out of the ordinary.¬† She stares across the street a long while as I get my phone out of my inside jacket pocket and begin dictating what the mugger looked like.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll report this online.‚Äù¬† We get to the house and file the report with NYPD.¬† We then report the cards stolen.¬† Every bit of unpleasantness done, I pull out all of Jackie‚Äôs valuables from my inside pockets and give them to her.¬† ‚ÄúSo, that decoy wallet idea?‚Äù

She looks at me and nods.¬† ‚ÄúGot it, sweetie, thanks for saving my ass there.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be a shame if that nice ass got stabbed or shot.¬† So, no worries.¬† We still have cake, right?‚Äù¬† She laughs and we go to the living room. ¬†¬†

Jackie and I share the cake the robber didn‚Äôt seem interested in and we enjoy a good time watching a French man try to have a Scottish accent while a Scottish man ignores that his character should have a Spanish accent. At least Clancy Brown is awesome.¬† Great birthday, 9/10 would be 10/10 with no muggings.

**May 7**

It‚Äôs dead today.¬† There are only 4 people in the shop right now.¬† The door chime calls out an irregular customer.¬† I look and see no one enter.¬† Huh?

That‚Äôs weird.¬† Then I see Nate, walking up to the counter.¬† *NATE*!¬† The 2-foot-long pseudo-dragon‚Ä¶?!!‚Äô

‚ÄúI apologize for the troubles I may cause.¬† I do require caffeine.¬† Much of it.‚Äù¬† I wonder what the 2 New Yorkers staring at this pseudo-dragon see and hear.¬† ‚ÄúVenti Pistachio Latte with an extra quad of espresso shots.‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe JUST the espresso may outmass you.¬† Are you sure about this?‚Äù¬† *Concern*.¬†

‚ÄúI am a big boy, I can handle it.‚Äù¬† *I would press x to doubt, but he is royalty.*¬† I nod and go get him his drink.

Both the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people watch the dragon drop silver dollars onto the counter.¬† It then drops one in the tip jar and bows to me.¬† It then carries a cup roughly twice its size out the door.¬†

I facepalm and wait.

‚ÄúDid that Lurch looking guy teach his lizard to get him coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure looks like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs awesome!‚Äù¬† *I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WORKED.*

Paul walks back in from doing inventory.¬† ‚ÄúAnything happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúKing of the Dragons came in, got a venti pistachio latte with an extra quad of shots and walked out after paying.¬† Just him‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?¬† Um‚Ä¶¬† that is a LOT of caffeine.¬† He‚Äôs like a tiny little guy.‚Äù¬† He is whispering and trying not to laugh.

‚ÄúYea, I don‚Äôt know how their phiso.. phiso‚Ä¶um.‚Äù

‚ÄúPhysiology?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have the dumb, and that word is hard.¬† Yea, I am not sure how he could metabolize all that.¬† But he looked like he needed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much did the normies freak?‚Äù¬† He looks around at the people still sitting at the tables.

‚ÄúApparently that ‚ÄòLurch lookin‚Äô guy‚Äô has a trained lizard.¬† No, that makes no sense considering it paid‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† Whatever is going on in this shop is a little sus if they are buying that.¬† *I wonder if I could sell them the Brooklyn Bridge?*¬†

Here are some thoughts:","I have a lot of things to say about this game, but I will limit myself to a few points in what I liked and what I disliked

**Visuals:**

\+ The games is absolutely beautiful and stunning. The attention to detail is amazing.  
\- I really disliked some of the changes of traditional designs. The darskpawn have the worst look of all the games

**Combat:**

\+ Best moment to moment combat so far  
\+ Equipment feel very different based on their special properties  
\- Companions are glorified skills. If you play as warrior a lot of times they become healbots

**Level Design:**

\+ Very straightforward, going against the endless wandering of Inquisition  
o When the game lets you, exploration is pretty fun, but a lot of times it's very handholding  
\- The puzzles sucks and even at lategame your companions remind you of the basics of solving them

**Worldbuiding**

\+ Great lore reveals trough the Regrets of the Dreadwolf questline  
\- A lot of important and relevant things were left out, like the chantry and, most egrarious, the elven reaction to their freaking gods showing up to destroy the world  
\- With the exception of Lavendel and Arlathan Forest all hubs area feel empty and lacking, the Lords of Fortune's being the worst  
\- Thedas almost complete destruction falls flat, just ONE cutsece showing the South being ravaged would be way more impactful than 10s of missives from the Inquisitor

**Main Quest**

\+ The last part of the game is pretty good, the last quest being a big highlight  
\+ Weisshaupt¬†was really good  
\+ Solas arc was well done, with him being a trickster until the very end  
O The villains were pretty basic, but still way better than Corypheus  
\- The beginning and middle of the game are pretty boring, with little forward movement  
\- The break to resolve each companions issues before continuing to save the world is very jarring

**Sidequests**

**+** Regrets of the Dreadwolf  
\- Everything Else

**Factions:**

\+ I love the Grey Wardens and they were the best faction  
\- All factions (even the Wardens) are very superficial, without any political intriguing or morally grey areas  
\- The Crows were completely butchered  
\- The Lords of Fortune are completely unnecessary. They should've be swapped by Kal-Sharok

**Companions a Whole:**

\+ All of their visual designs were pretty well done and unique  
\+ They have fun interaction with each other and seem to enjoy their companies  
\- A very weak ensemble, most of them are very superficial  
\- Almost complete lack of tension between them. No political, ideological or moral clashs

**Bellara:**

\+ Voice acting is amazing  
\- Quirky girl stereotype  
\- Her quest sucks. You have a lot of talks about her killing Cyrian, only for him to somehow breakfree of his mind control and kills himself to save her.  
\- The archivist should be a big deal to the Dalish, but It's treated like a second thought

**Davrin**

\+ Actually feels like a friend to Rook  
\+ Assan  
\+ Down to earth and very realistic dude  
\+ I really like him  
O Weak ending choice

**Emmrich**

\+ Highlight of the companions  
\+ Very charming and interesting guy  
\+ Lich lore is really great  
\+ Unique nemesis  
\+ Great ending choice,  
\- I'm sorry but I don't really care about Manfred

**Harding**

\+ Great lore connection to the dwarfs  
\+ Good questline  
O She's fine  
O Boring ending Choice  
\- Instead of maturing 10 years it feels like she regressed 10 years  
\- Should be the leader instead of Rook

**Lucanis**

\+ Good voice acting and performance  
\- This guy sucks. He is superficial, only talks about coffee and fails twice at his job, the second time resulting in the death of a better companion  
\- Spite is the worst demon I can remember. He feels like a misbehaving child instead of a monster  
\- Nobody (except Davrin) about this abomination walking around  
\- Terrible questline with an awful ending choice. How the hell you can't kill his traitor bastard of a cousin?

**Neve**

\+ I like her personality and connection to the lore  
O Her voice acting feels very bland sometimes  
\- Weak storyline with weak ending choice  
\- Very little to say about Tevinter as a whole

**Taash**

\+ I like her design and the lore connections of both Qunari and Rivain societies  
\+ The last quest and ending choice are pretty fun  
\+ Only actual tragic moment of the companions    
\- Absolutely insufferable. Feels like an overgrown teenager  
\- The Dragon King is an idiot and has a very anticlimactic death  
\- Harding deserves better 

**Rook**

\- The absolutely worst part of this game  
\- Worst main character in an RPG I've ever played  
\- You are locked in a single personality regardless of what you choose. I tended to pick all the serious options and they still looked like a goofball 100% of the time  
\- Their mannerism are repetitive and look ridiculous   
\- You can't really disagree with anything, be confrontational, be an asshole or even refuse to help anyone  
\- Why is this random person the leader of this very competent group of people?  
\- Only seems to get serious and pissed after Solas trade places with them  
\- Team mom and therapist, resolving all of them squabbles and mental health problems  
\- Nobody seems to like them as a friend or leader, they just follow their orders for whatever reason. They have a lot of interactions between themselves but almost never include Rook  
\- I miss Hawke

  
Anyway, that's a few of the things on my mind right now, but I do have a lot to say about the factions yet

Overall I think the game is good, mostly because the ending is pretty fun and complex and the combat is fine enough. I don't think Dragon Age will ever come back and I'm not sure I even want it to come back

I have no hope that Mass Effect 5 will be any good.
