1ixq1p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSurgery/comments/1ixq1p2/alberta_canada_process_tracking_review/,"Alberta, Canada Process Tracking & Review","Heyo! 

Just wanted to write a timeline of my top surgery experience so far since there's not a whole lot of detailed Canadian rep on the internet üôÇ

I am speaking specifically about my experience with double incision surgery with Dr Rodrigo Neira, located in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. 

I personally identify as agender and have not been on HRT, nor do I currently have plans to be.


Demographics: Early 30s, 36A chest prior to surgery, ~150lbs, 5‚Äô7‚Äù. 


Early Sept, 2023: Spoke to my GP and mentioned wanting a referral for top surgery. My GP had some basic questions about transitioning in general and after we chatted, she requested that I make an appointment with their in house mental health nurse just for due diligence. 


Sept 18, 2023: Appointment with mental health nurse. After this appointment, the nurse emailed me and let me know that she and my GP have sent a referral to a psychiatrist so that I can get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (required by Alberta law if you want AHS to pay for the surgery). Note that my GP and the nurse chose a clinic with a short wait time, regardless of their scope of practise.


Oct 5, 2023: Appointment with the psychiatrist. Note this professional did NOT specialize in gender related issues. He mentioned during the appointment that he was not comfortable formally diagnosing me with dysphoria as it is not his expertise, BUT that he would write a letter stating that I appeared to fit the criteria and that surgery would positively impact my life. He went over the letter with me during the appointment and asked if I agreed/approved with the content.


Nov 1, 2023: I had a visit with my GP not related to this process, but we touched base on the psychiatrist visit, the letter he sent to my GP, and if it accurately reflected how the visit went. I was provided the opportunity to dispute anything in the letter and for my GP to advocate on my behalf for any rewrites. I did not require this.


Nov 5, 2023: My GP called to let me know the paperwork was sent to Dr. Neira's office. At the time, I had asked around a bit and heard the wait time for a call from Neira's office was around 5-8 months.


June 30, 2024: I phoned Dr. Neira's office and left a message about the status of my referral. 


July 8, 2024: Dr. Neira's office phoned me back and scheduled a consult for July 25th. This was later rescheduled to July 23rd.


July 23, 2024: Had my consult! Took about an hour, between paperwork, waiting in the consult room, and the exam. Misty (Dr. Neira's assistant) let me know that they are currently booking into January, 2025 for surgeries so it will be a few months before I hear anything.


December 12, 2024: Phoned Neira‚Äôs office to check in on the status of things and was told they were currently working on ordering supplies for January‚Äôs procedures. Misty asked if I wanted to book one of their open slots (January 23, 2025 in Innisfail, AB). I said yes, but that I need to double check if that works with my partner since I don‚Äôt drive. Misty put me down and requested I call back ASAP to let her know. 

I will call Misty back later today to confirm or cancel. She let me know that there‚Äôs some additional paperwork to do if confirmed. Will update this post again when I have specifics for the paperwork. 


December 13, 2024: I called Misty back and let her know I cannot take the January date. She asked when would work for me and I said mid to late February. They are not working on February‚Äôs OR schedule yet so she has added me to the list of patients to book in Feb.

She also mentioned that post surgery there‚Äôd be at least one follow up with Dr Neira, and then the rest would be with my personal GP who is located in Edmonton where I live. 


January 13, 2025: I called to check in on my status and Misty let me know that I've been added to February's schedule, she just hadn't had a chance to call me yet üôÇ 
New appointment date is Feb 24, in Stettler AB. Misty mentioned that the hospital in Stettler would call me about a week prior to surgery to go over everything I'd need to bring as well as how to prep for the procedure. Very excited!


February 18, 2025: received a phone call from Stettler Hospital with surgery details (arrival time, fasting and medication instructions, etc). Procedure is at 8AM but they requested we arrive at 6. My partner and I are going to drive down the night before and spend the night in a hotel. For prep, they said to have regular dinner, a snack before bed, and then clear liquids only after that (black coffee or tea okay - no milk/sugar). At 5AM I am to drink 2 cups of apple juice or cranberry cocktail. They told me to bring warm socks to wear in the OR and to shower either the night before or morning of. I do not need to take my piercings (ear and nose) out as long as I am not wearing metal jewelry (bioplast, plastic, glass are okay to wear). I have an adhesive allergy so they wrote that down and will use paper tape instead of plastic medical tape. 


Feb 24, 2025: the big day!!! We arrived at the hospital at 6AM. The (one!) nurse on duty check me in. Checkin involved taking my vitals, height, weight, medications, allergies, and reviewing my medical history. After that she showed me to a little room with 2 stretchers in it and had me change into a robe, foot booties, and a hairnet. She instructed no bra or underwear but to keep on my socks. She also had me do a urine sample so they could run a pregnancy test. My partner and I killed some time chatting and then around 7:30, the two nurses on day shift entered and set up an IV in my hand and began infusing a bag of lactaided ringer‚Äôs. 


Around 8 they wheeled me on the stretcher to the surgical suite where I said goodbye to my partner. A surgical nurse checked me into surgery by asking what procedure I‚Äôm having, going over the prep I did, and confirming my checkin with the prior nurse. After that I was visited by the anesthesiologist who went over similar information as well as anesethic specific questions. The checkin nurse told me to mention my ear and face piercings to the anesthesiologist, who took at look at them and said they were fine to leave in (I had put plastic jewelry in all of them, and I have my ears stretched to 0g). After that, we waited for Dr Neira who apparently tends to run late üòõ


Once he arrived (unsure of time, there was no clock), he took me into a private room to make up my chest. This involved stripping to the waist and facing him. He put a soft tape measure around my neck to make sure his markings were symmetrical. Markup took about 3 minutes. I had the opportunity to ask him any questions (eg diagonal, rounded, flat). If I had wanted atypical scar shapes, this is where I would have asked. Neira was very upbeat and sweet during this and after the markup was finished he waved and said ‚Äúbye bye, boys!‚Äù to my breasts (LOL). After, I was showed back to my stretcher by a nurse and I asked if I should have an empty bladder and told yes, so I used the washroom. 


I was then wheeled into the operation room on a stretcher and transferred myself to the operation table. It was very skinny and had 2 ‚Äúwings‚Äù out to the side, one for each arm. The nurses explained what each thing was as they set it up: they put a loose strap around each arm, my legs, and my torso so I wouldn‚Äôt move much. They also put diodes on my temples to monitor my temperature, and they put inflating-and-deflating wraps around my calves to make sure my blood moved during the operation (to help prevent clots - it reminded me a lot of the auto inflating blood pressure cuff they used to take vitals). The anesthesiologist used some rough cloth to exfoliate around my hairline and apply some diodes to monitor my brain activity so she could make sure I stayed asleep. As they setup, she had swapped my IV to anesthesia and I was feeling sleepy throughout this. I felt a little bit dizzy right before I fell asleep.


I woke up around 12 pm back in the room on a stretcher. My chest was bandaged and I had 2 JP drains installed, one on each side. They were not secured to anything so itd be a good idea to ask your partner to bring a lanyard and/or safety pins with them when they get the call so you don‚Äôt have to hold them when you get dressed (they are kinda gross and warm). I don‚Äôt remember this part super well because I was groggy. The nurses came to check on me and give me something to drink. My mouth was very dry and tasted like plastic (I believe I was intubated during surgery). I was not in pain but the place the drains come out felt ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and a little twingey when I moved at certain angles. After the nurses confirmed I was feeling well, they called my partner. When he arrived, the nurses filled me in on aftercare and gave me a document to refer to. My partner took notes in addition to the info packet. This is also when I gave them my forms for time off work to have Neira fill out. Once he‚Äôd filled it out (about 20 mins?) the nurses had me review it for accuracy. They called and setup Homecare in Edmonton for me. They let me know I can follow up with my GP in Edmonton in about 10 days instead of driving back to see Dr Neira in Red Deer. When I felt ready, they let me know I could get dressed and head home. I think we were at the hospital for about an hour with me awake and waiting for the anesthesia to wear off. 


My partner and I drove home to Edmonton and it was uneventful. I was not hungry but we grabbed a snack (smoothie and fries from McDonalds) so I wouldn‚Äôt get sick. When we got home I emptied my drains and then went to sleep. NOTE: I recommend eating something small when you get home even if you‚Äôre not hungry!! I did not and immediately went to sleep for 5 hours and woke up nauseous and shaky because I hadn‚Äôt eaten enough. Fortunately I had bought some Ensure drinks and drinking one fixed me up while my partner made some food. It‚Äôs 8pm now and I‚Äôm still not hungry but it feels good to have something in my stomach.


Currently having some tightness in my chest but it feels mild and normal. Neira let me know to go to the closest hospital if there‚Äôs any issues. I plan to also call 811 for advice if needed. 


Side note, the drains are a little stinky which I didn‚Äôt expect. It‚Äôs not gross but if you‚Äôre sensitive to smells you should be prepared to smell it a bit! It just smells kind of like blood and ‚Äúhealing‚Äù (musky and a tiny bit sweet, to my nose).

I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm much more likely to relate with someone I meet through the internet than someone I meet in person, just because the internet has tailored our ability to find like-minded people

I craved for a free, open, and honest conversation, where I can be myself more. Where i don't have to pressure myself to think deep just to prove a point. A light conversation, but not too lightly that it seems like we're only wasting our time and energy. Maybe just in the middle. Where we can learn something from one another, at the same time not pressuring the both of us.

About me:
* love Mitski and Laufey so much accck i could listen to em for 24/7

1ixptk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/excoc/comments/1ixptk9/icoc_in_california/,ICOC in California," i apologize a head of time for typos and such i‚Äôm writing this after work and im dyslexic and ill just be kinda rambling so bare w me lmao

hi im 20 yro and grew up in the icoc, i left in 2019! and im no longer christian, but i‚Äôm curious as to ppls experience w the ICOC in california (or just the west coast in general), i‚Äôm reading a lot of experiences on here and a lot of it seems to be coming from the south. i‚Äôm seeing comments of ppl saying they‚Äôre shocked and werent aware it spread to the west coast, they‚Äôre are actually a lot of icoc churches here in CA! and they‚Äôre just as indoctrinating. Me personally i was raised going to ICOC, my parents were deeply involved in it since the early 90s and helped launch one of their churches here on the coast connected to Icoc. LA being the biggest in part of the CA icoc branch. i will say, in this time of my life in 2025, im am incredibly grateful to say that majority of my family including my parents, have left the icoc. It was farrrrrrr from easy, but we got here and i‚Äôm eternally grateful for that. my relationships w them are healthy and we‚Äôre taking the time to heal and be there for eachother and just hav grace. we‚Äôve started a small group of ex icoc members to deconstruct everything and heal bc we were all manipulated at the end of the day. my dad specifically was treated as a commodity by the church. the branch i was apart will most likely die out by the end of this yr bc ppl are realizing how manipulating it was.

my parents were heavily indoctrinated and loyal so much so they heavily neglected me and my siblings. me and my siblings are very independent have been since a young age. bc we had to take care of ourselves, the church had this priority list for everyone. god, the church, ur marriage, and everyone else (children included), this mentality is what lead to sm neglect. i practically spent most of my childhood with my parents while they were ‚Äúreaching out‚Äù to ppl at church events and such. the neglect got to the point i didn‚Äôt get the proper amount of food as a kid and would spend a lot of time asking ppl at school if i could hav some food or there left overs. it was encourage to shun ur kids for showing emotions or for ‚Äúacting out,‚Äù our whole childhoods ppl always describe us as well behaved. 

another core part of my child hood was a lot of fear was condition in me. i was so painfully aware at such a young age about ‚Äòsin‚Äô that it left me in constant state of paranoia. i was scared to hav friends outside of the church bc i thought i would be shamed if ppl at church found out about it. i tried to to hide it from my school friends that i was religious bc i was embarrassed and ashamed it, i didn‚Äôt want to be associated w it even at that age;  but i couldn‚Äôt let the church or my parents know that. and i tried to hide that i had non religious friends or even friends that don‚Äôt go to the same church from the icoc/my parents (i was like 6-7). i spent my childhood in sm fear of being punished for doing normal kid things. i was also not allowed to go to pools, me and my mom spent almost my whole life arguing over modest swim suits (‚Äúmodesty‚Äù in general tbh), i always new smthing was wrong but i was so young and not in a position to oppose anything. to be clear i hav always been ostracized in the church, ppl always treated me weird i never got along w ppl my age they always seem to secret animosity for me. come to find out (in 2023) i was undiagnosed autistic. 

another really pivotal moment in my life were the preteen/ teen camps they sent u too over the summer, the things they would preach were some of the most heinous things ive ever heard. all the classic purity culture stuff, homophobia mixed in, theyd get a de transitioned trans person to preach or a lesbian/gay person who married the opposite gender or pledged to abstinence to preach to 14 yros. i remeber asking them (anonymously during one of their sermons) how as christian can we support the lgbtqia+ (unknowingly closeted at the time) and they‚Äôre response was you dont and if they don‚Äôt repent they will be damned. it broke my heart. i had alr started discovering myself atp. there were so many old men who sexualize me as a child or would hug me to oddly, like they didn‚Äôt grope me but they would be weirdly sensual. they believed in not talking about sex they acted like it was dirty but also beautiful as long as ur in a marriage, my parents almost pulled me out of sex ed in school bc the church said not too bc it was harming us and that it was teaching us to masturbate w fruit (that did even happen?? ), i didn‚Äôt understand wat a clit was till Highschool, didn‚Äôt fully grasp how sex worked either. it was bad. sm fear condition in us. this condition effects my romantic relationships to this day.

(my relationship w my mom goes deeper than this but this is the simple version) my relationship with my mother my whole life was incredibly rocky i would hide from her when she got home from work in the bathroom for 2 hrs bc it was my only safe space. we weren‚Äôt allowed to have our phones in our rooms, hav the door closed, and had to turn in our phones before bed (id figure out ways to get around it ofc). all she had to say to me were criticisms, she would constantly make comments on her appearance and others, she would try to encourage me that i was becoming a women and i hated it and wanted nothing to do with it. that having a uterus and boobs means you provide kids one day to my future husband and she‚Äôll get granbabies (my mom has since apolgized for this lmao). ever since i was kid i was always very vocal about not wanting that and not being a ‚Äúlady,‚Äù (i was a tom boy). growing boobs and curves was a nightmare for me. when i wanted to be built flat chested w no curves i didn‚Äôt want to be a women but not a man either. another instance of purity culture, i was 14 when the pastors wife had scheduled a time w me for coffee, she spent the entire time trying to convince me into wanting things i don‚Äôt want, like having my own kids (over fostering/adopting) and getting married and how ‚Äúoh i said that back then! but i change my mind and im happy that i did‚Äù all that trad wife BS, i‚Äôm not easily swayed like that, ive always know i don‚Äôt want that and still don‚Äôt. 

they‚Äôd also frequently did these humiliation rituals essentially, all the bible trivia and tests and homework they gave you in kids kingdom and you‚Äôd get shuned for not knowing it as well as another kid, it was incredibly discouraging as a kid.  

i also experienced the pressure to study the bible and get baptized, i was the youngest in my age bracket of kids, so when everyone else before me studied and got baptized all the sudden it was my turn. i didn‚Äôt want to. but felt like i had to. this was late 2019-2020, we got both half way thru before i ghosted them. it wasn‚Äôt entirely unintentional but i was going thru sm during that time. my (ex) best friend of 10 yrs stopped talking to me giving me no reason why, this kid threaten to kill me and my friend at school, bomb threats at school, 4 ppl i knew died wthin the first 2 months of 2020, then covid and lockdown ofc. anyways i was goin thru a lot but i stopped planing the study‚Äôs w them. and i just stopped going all tgher. i held a lot of resentment towards the church and my mom, and also sm guilt and shame and thought i was going to be condemned, gladly that feeling went away after a year. still carried the resentment up until about last yr id say. i feel i‚Äôve been the healthiest ive ever been and its freeing.

About 10 years ago I went on holiday to Sicily. I stayed in what I thought was a crappy Airbnb - didn‚Äôt look like the pictures, the room had no windows and the art you find on the walls in Costa coffee. The bed was on a mezzanine - kinda nice. 

I went to sleep and woke in the night. Above the end of my bed was a bright white dazzling light, the brightest I have seen. It started moving from the above the end of my bed towards me quite slowly but definitely coming to me. I was panicking trying to wake up my boyfriend up and turn the light on. I turned the light on and it disappeared. 

I have had sleep paralysis before a few times and this wasn‚Äôt anything like that. The next day my boyfriend was talking to the guy on the door about the building and didn‚Äôt mention what had happened. Turns out our room used to be a chapel and had been converted.

1ixprhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rhodeskin/comments/1ixprhh/rhode_la_popup_review_tips_and_advice/,Rhode LA Pop-Up Review: Tips and Advice,"Hi everyone, 

I went to the Rhode pop-up earlier today on a weekday since I had the day off and I wanted to share some insight on my experience. Tips below this post.

If you are on the fence of going to the pop-up: It's not an obligation but it just feels like it makes the experience worth it, to buy something. I am in the minority of guys wearing rhode but I love the skincare line and excited to try the lip treatment.

I got there at around 10:30 am and waited in line. The line was wrapped around the corner but stopped at Alfred's. (Now if it wrapped around by the Gucci store, then it would've been a wrap, but I was worried I was gonna miss the capacity cut-off, so yeah). Now if it stops near Alfred's, I recommend you order a coffee or a matcha for pick-up and drink it during the pop-up if you need a pick-me-up while navigating through the pop-up line. They started giving water to everyone around this time. I got my wristband for guaranteed entry.

The line moved up fast, very fast. It moved three times during the first hour. By noon, we were already by the corner of the street and then moved by Catch Steak (by this point they gave us the pastries from Cafe de Leche) and then we got umbrellas once we got to the BloomBloom/For Lease sign.

I waited 2 hours in the zig-zag line by the Rhode Tate McRae sign, in the meantime, the team gave us a burrito from Gracias Se√±or and a Rhode-branded juice with jicama, strawberry, lime and watermelon. The worker gives you a badge to enter, and then you reach the famous scratcher to see which free gift you got (I thought this was cool). Most people got bumper stickers, and some got a Rhode product, it is just luck. We waited in line and then entered the building. There are photo-ops and the products on display. However, it is very fast-paced and you have to know what you want so you can tell the rhode associate what you want.

I ordered my peptide lip treatment and 16 pro max lip phone case and left at around 4pm, I was only planning on getting the lip treatment but I was influenced by someone given how long I waited and I don't want to deal with shipping and wait a week, might as well. 

Tips:

\- Bring a foldable chair if you can. You are going to be standing the whole time. There were people with foldable chairs and moved with the line along with it.

\- While you wait, plan what you are going to buy while you are in line and have a list ready to show to the rep. For those who are looking for the travel size skincare set, they have them except the barrier restore cream. I didn't get it since I am not traveling anytime soon but will do once it restocks on the site.

\- Order first and do photo ops second. 

\- Stay hydrated and wear sunscreen.

\- It is better visit on a weekday than on a weekend. You will be fine if you get there by 11am. If you want to be the first ones in line, and leave early. That's cool. The line didn't close until 5pm.

\- Plan accordingly and make a list on what you are gonna get or urgently need. Make sure for the cases, it is the correct case and items.

1ixpowh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One_Scallion_6415/comments/1ixpowh/best_furniture_for_boutique_hotels_what_to_look/,Best Furniture for Boutique Hotels ‚Äì What to Look For,"Boutique hotels are known for their unique charm, personalized service, and stylish interiors. Unlike large chain hotels, boutique hotels focus on creating a distinctive experience for their guests. One of the key elements that contribute to this experience is the furniture. The right furniture not only enhances the aesthetics of the hotel but also ensures comfort, durability, and functionality.

If you are setting up or upgrading a boutique hotel, choosing the right furniture is crucial. In this guide, we will explore what to look for when selecting furniture for boutique hotels, the latest trends, and how to find the best **Hotel Furniture Suppliers**.

# 1. Understanding Boutique Hotel Aesthetics

Boutique hotels are not one-size-fits-all. Each hotel has its unique theme, whether it‚Äôs vintage, modern, bohemian, or industrial. Before selecting furniture, consider the overall aesthetic you want to achieve.

# Common Boutique Hotel Styles:

* **Modern Minimalist:** Clean lines, neutral tones, and functional furniture with sleek designs.
* **Bohemian Chic:** Eclectic furniture with bright colors, natural materials, and artistic details.
* **Industrial Style:** Raw materials like metal, exposed brick, and distressed wood.
* **Classic Elegance:** Luxurious materials like velvet, gold accents, and detailed carvings.
* **Rustic Retreat:** Wooden furniture, warm colors, and cozy textures.

Once you identify the theme, you can select furniture that complements the overall look and feel of the hotel.

# 2. Choosing the Best Hotel Chairs

Seating plays a crucial role in guest comfort and aesthetics. **Hotel Chairs** should be both stylish and comfortable to enhance the guest experience.

# What to Consider When Choosing Hotel Chairs:

* **Comfort:** Guests will spend hours sitting, so ergonomic design and cushioned seats are important.
* **Material:** Opt for durable materials like solid wood, metal, or high-quality upholstered fabrics.
* **Style:** Match the chair design with the hotel‚Äôs theme. For example, velvet chairs suit luxury hotels, while wooden chairs fit rustic styles.
* **Maintenance:** Choose materials that are easy to clean and resistant to stains.

# Types of Hotel Chairs:

1. **Lobby Chairs** ‚Äì Plush and inviting to make a great first impression.
2. **Dining Chairs** ‚Äì Comfortable yet stylish to enhance the dining experience.
3. **Lounge Chairs** ‚Äì Relaxing chairs for bars, lounges, and common areas.
4. **Outdoor Chairs** ‚Äì Weather-resistant furniture for patios and garden spaces.

Selecting the right **Hotel Chairs** ensures that guests feel comfortable and enjoy their stay.

# 3. Essential Furniture for Boutique Hotel Rooms

Each hotel room should be designed to offer both comfort and functionality. The furniture must be well-chosen to fit the room‚Äôs size and style.

*Mid-2672, Atlas System, Orbit of Atlas Prime*

*Commander Zuna Wolf, TRSC Phantom Queen. 4*^(th) *Fleet Offensive Expeditionary Unit*

Around her, the drum of the crew members filled the bridge as orders were issued from lower commissioned officers to the even lower enlisted helping hands that worked menial jobs fit for their rank.

As for herself, Zuna sat in silent contemplation upon her seat as her eyes focused on the enlarged virtual display before her; where several others of equally high rank stood in conversation with each other.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you; we should convert the planet into the forward operating base. We already have a suitable area we can designate for the foundation, and the terrain is more than suitable for a wealth of bunkers for not just personnel, but civilians. We have a unique opportunity to turn Atlas Prime into one of the largest trading systems this side of the Republic!‚Äù

The one who spoke so passionately about a ground side project was her operation‚Äôs officer. But his suggestion was denied before two more officers opposite of himself.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just redirect funds for a project that was never authorized, Jadari. We‚Äôll move forward with the orbital station, as previously proposed. We should need to go down to planet except perhaps for training.‚Äù

The one who rebutted the operation‚Äôs officer was Lieutenant Commander Grace, her executive officer.

As for the planet itself, it was perfectly suitable for life, harboring a strong enough magnetic field to protect against the sun it orbited, as well as a thick enough atmosphere for one to live comfortably. It‚Äôs a forested planet with large plots of snow-covered mountains and fields, and a large body of water that made up at least sixty percent of the planet, with the other forty split between forests, plains and overwhelming amounts of snow.

Seeing the potential tourist attraction, Zuna offered her thoughts.

‚ÄúJadari isn‚Äôt wrong,‚Äù she began, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not something we can focus on right now. The station will come first, and since it will be geosynchronous with the planet, plans to install an elevator have already been submitted. However,‚Äù she paused.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs potential for recreational activities for not just future families, but soon to be travelers. Jadari, study the planet and its geography, and draft a plan for certain activities' planet side. This way, once the station opens up as a way station, we can draw in travelers for activities planet side. Think of it as a financial investment‚Ä¶‚Äù

With a face previously dejected, it had now returned to life with a wide smile.

‚ÄúOf course, Ma\`am! I‚Äôll get it to you first thing in the morning!‚Äù replied Jadari, as he left to his quarters, leaving herself, the XO and another silent officer who only witnessed the exchange.

Now having resolved that issue, she slumped back in her chair as she pondered the numerous screens before her.

‚ÄúSay,‚Äù Zuna began, directing her voice to the previously silent officer; a Lieutenant by the name of Yamato. ‚ÄúDo we have any word from the MEU? Where are we on those targets?‚Äù

In silence, Yamato tapped away on the tactical display she stood before, reducing the image of their current system to an upgraded star map from beyond Atlas, simply dubbed as the Wild Regions.

In a soft, but clear tone, she responded, ‚ÄúThe Marines report capturing another set of Transport Hubs, and are loading their assault carrier with refugees. It's reported that they have embarked roughly fifteen hundred individuals thus far‚Ä¶‚Äù

Zuna then rubbed the bridge of her nose in frustration, knowing well that their efforts seem utterly wasted in light of the millions who were taken, especially since most of those saved were only Sellians.

‚ÄúAny humans found among them?‚Äù asked Zuna, to which Yamato replied with a shake of her head.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, no. But we were told that most were present, but were taken roughly a year ago.‚Äù

Zuna returned with a large sigh upon seeing their efforts with significantly reduced returns that she had hoped, ‚ÄúLieutenant Commander Grace, any word from the recon team or the AEU?‚Äù

The man in question paused his work, turning to her with prepared answers, ‚ÄúFrom the recon team, a bit. More coordinates and planetary intel, and that‚Äôs about it. As for Raptor Team, they‚Äôre on standby; currently en route to a Raid target. Other than that, we‚Äôre in the dark.‚Äù

Upon hearing his report, she could only sway in her seat has she recalled the man who led the Raider Team in deep space, Captain O'Brian. She was saddened by their departure, but she had managed to keep in contact with him any chance she could, alleviating her troubled feelings. Now reminiscent of his company, she scrolled through past messages and photos taken just before deployment during her month of leave.

Seeing her newly brightened expression, Grace inquired to the sudden expression made by his superior.

‚ÄúAnd what has you in such high spirits?‚Äù he asked.

Zuna replied, pausing her hummed tune, ‚ÄúWell, I think I may have found the one, Grace.‚Äù

As if a question mark appeared above his head, confusion erupted on his face that left him, and those around the bridge, in the same curious state.

But before he could speak, Yamato interjected, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt heard?‚Äù she said, to which he shook his head to the sides.

‚ÄúThe Commander seems to have found herself a man. Frankly, I heard that was the case shortly after the war, but I never believed it, until just recently.‚Äù Yamato referenced to their time aboard the station above Mars, just before they boarded their ships for deployment.

‚ÄúWhen we all returned from palm, I saw the Commander with a man at a restaurant. They seemed friendly, but I wasn‚Äôt able to get a good look at him‚Ä¶‚Äù

Finally returning from her stroll through memory lane, Zuna interjected her colleague mid-sentence, ‚ÄúCompared to the folks from the academy, he‚Äôs everything I wish to see myself with till the end of my days‚Ä¶‚Äù she replied listlessly.

‚ÄúThat serious, huh?‚Äù voiced Grace, and followed by a nod from Yamato.

‚ÄúGot a picture, Commander?‚Äù she requested, causing Zuna‚Äôs face to redden, but before she could attempt to show them, an alarm blared upon the bridge that stiffened their postures until a report came from the ship‚Äôs sensor specialist.

‚ÄúCommander! Got several space ruptures; edge of the system!‚Äù With his report, her previously carefree expression sharpened to one of a predator on the hunt.

‚ÄúDo we have word on the MEU‚Äôs return?‚Äù she asked, to which Yamato shook her head.

‚ÄúNegative, they‚Äôre present in the Bravo sector, and are currently engaged in patrol‚Ä¶‚Äù

Just beyond Atlas, there was a series of systems that effectively paralleled the previously owned Sellian space. Connected to Atlas was a single system, but it was large with several gas giants and rocky planets, that connected to three other systems; with two leading towards the north and west. That immediate region of space was deemed Alpha Sector, and the systems that extended to the east were dubbed Bravo, Charlie, and Delta, respectively. And each sector was designated with a minimum of three systems that led to the north, towards a region called the Arm of Gellora; a series of systems that expanded horizontally, separating the Wilds Region into north and south.

Looking upon their map, it was viewed in such a way that used cardinal directions for simplicity. And from the report, indicated that it had to be an enemy presence.

‚ÄúAll ships, man your battle stations!‚Äù she ordered into a microphone that transmitted her voice to all ships within the system. ‚ÄúMorri, do we have satellite connection for accurate firing solutions?‚Äù

With her remark, the visage of a woman dressed in an archaic patchwork of furs and bone-made adornments illuminated on a podium beside her chair.

‚ÄúI can only access three of the five we currently have, but two are within range for viewing. I‚Äôve begun solution metrics and calculating prediction pips for MAC capable ships.‚Äù

The satellites that the AI spoke of were erected not long after their arrival in the system. They‚Äôre advanced, allowing to view a large portion of space for anomalies, and using its precision data, could draft up telemetry needed for a well-coordinated strike beyond normal sensor ranges. It was standard in most populated systems, especially the core worlds, but was lacking in colonial space.

‚ÄúWhat are we looking at?‚Äù Zuna questioned as she studied the analytics viewable on the numerous screens available to her.

‚ÄúIt looks to be a large fleet from initial scans,‚Äù replied Yamato, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not Sellian, and archive data reports it as incomplete‚Ä¶‚Äù

Zuna frowned at the information as she began to analyze the emerging battlefield, ‚ÄúMorri, can you pull data provided from the recon and Raptor Teams?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne moment,‚Äù replied the artificial companion, pausing for several seconds before returning with a favorable answer.

‚ÄúI searched through data from the Mamba Team A.I. known as Justinius, as well as my progenitor, Athena. Cross-referencing their data, I have determined these ships to be Toskan in nature.‚Äù

‚ÄúToskan?‚Äù replied Yamato, still foreign to the species as a whole.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Toskan‚Äôs were present during the Invasions of Dema and Draxis colonies, taking upwards of several million residents.‚Äù M√≥rr√≠gan explained, turning towards Zuna, who urged her to continue. ‚ÄúI suggest we promptly eradicate these dregs and simply scavenge what we can from their ships. I have enough data for accurate fire, if you‚Äôd let me‚Ä¶‚Äù She requested, which Zuna had seriously considered.

All she knew of the race was that they simply carried off innocent civilians, while those unworthy to be taken alive were killed and discarded. Recalling their crimes against the civilian populace, anger rose within her, and she did little to hide it.

‚ÄúHail them. See if they slow, then calculate a precision strike with MACs on their engines. If we have any Reaper-Class corvettes, have them strike at the smaller ships. If I don‚Äôt like what I hear, reduce them to stardust,‚Äù ordered Zuna.

A smile then erupted on the AI‚Äôs face as she began her calculations and a medium-sized screen attached to her seat lit up to life. Upon it, the visage of a well-dressed alien with tusks at the corners of its mouth had presented itself, with a countenance of an unfavorable nature; infuriated by her very presence. It spoke with what sounded like a full mouth, impeded by the fat on its cheeks and neck.

‚ÄúYou must be Terran, I presume. And a female at that‚Ä¶‚Äù he began with a lecherous smile and gaze. But her expression in response was cold and unchanging, with amber eyes dilated and focused solely on the prey before her.

‚ÄúAnd you are trespassing on Terran Republic Space. Turn back now, or be fired upon.‚Äù She replied promptly. However, it laughed in response to her warning; looking down on her and her crew.

‚ÄúAm I supposed to be intimidated? To take you seriously? I know the females of your race, and they certainly know their place in submission as nothing more than whores of the flesh; to know only the taste of linen, with their asses raised. Cease this farce, and you may survive yet.‚Äù

As he spoke, the air on the bridge had cooled to chilling effect. The room was silent, with no one on the bridge willing to make a sound, lest they face death itself. There was no smirk paired with a rebuttal, or calculated counter; simply anger. But Wolf knew better than to let her emotions run astray in the face of combat, or in this case, the feckless buzz of an insect.

‚ÄúI believe it is common courtesy between captains of their vessels, let alone their own fleets, to lack decorum when addressing their opposing party. Am I wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúHah! You are neither a warrior nor a captain! Compared to my fleet, you amount to that of a mere patrol. But Since we are talking like this, perhaps I can humor you‚Ä¶ I'm searching for my brother, Barin Tarba. He‚Äôs ventured out beyond this region, and I can‚Äôt seem to reach him. If you let me pass, I may be able to overlook your transgressions, *female*.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoh?‚Äù sounded Wolf as she reclined in her seat with a crossing of a leg over the other, she rested her chin upon her wrist. She offered a look towards Yamato, who silently sent her information regarding the individual that populated on Zuna‚Äôs personal display.

As she scanned it with haste, understood the kind of man this ‚Äò*captain*‚Äô was searching for. He was found on Lotac Three, forming deals with a Sellian Chief-Commander turned planetary warlord to enslave what the Sellian deemed as undesirables; those who didn‚Äôt wish to subject themselves to his rule. And the end of the report revealed that O'Brian and his team were responsible for his capture, and later turned over to the New Sellian Council. It didn‚Äôt reveal what happened to him after, and frankly, she didn‚Äôt care. Only enraged by the Toskan‚Äôs arrogant display of power and false authority.

Zuna then began with an audible scoff, ‚ÄúPerhaps, I misunderstood you. Would you like your brother back? The one who made deals with a warlord Sellian commander to enslave his own people? The one that is quite possibly enduring what I can assume is no better than enslavement itself? That Barin? Sorry, but I think I would have a better time digging through shit with my bare hands than to meet your demands. All units, engage at will.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou!‚Äù he tried to rebuke, but fell silent at the raise of her hand as a ship from his fleet seemingly detonated. ‚ÄúWhat! What happened!?‚Äù he called out from beyond his screen. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean it ‚Äòjust‚Äô blew up? Were their shields not raised!? Answer me!‚Äù

But as he searched for an answer from his own crew, realized that the reason was right in front of him. Why he hadn‚Äôt realize sooner, she didn‚Äôt know, but assumed he was just as incompetent as he thought himself to be a menace among the stars.

‚ÄúIt seems the period of amnesty has ended. Prepare to be boarded, and your assets seized,‚Äù she declared, and with another wave of her hand, consigned portions of his fleet to oblivion.

It was with sudden bursts of light that tungsten-ferric rounds were accelerated to fractions of the speed of light, with pitch, yaw, and roll all accounted in a firing solution that was accurate to mere meters; enough to have a grouping land in a single segment of their broadside.

It was a feat fit only for a complex intelligence such as M√≥rr√≠gan, who seemingly took pride in the destruction of their enemy.

‚Äú*It is in fire and brimstone that humanity rose from their own ashes to inherit the stars‚Ä¶ And for crimes against my creators, I sign your execution!*‚Äù

As her fleet continued to fire concentrated volleys of what was essentially sniper fire, she monitored the condition of the enemy as well as her own fleet for any anomalies. While she knew she held superiority in terms of firepower, she also understood that her position in the fight was just as vulnerable.

‚ÄúI want a deep scan of our flanks. Electromagnetic, infrared‚Ä¶ hell, if there is so much a nanometer jump in your feedback, I want it found and eliminated.‚Äù

Compared to the fleet encountered several years ago, she found that it wasn‚Äôt large at all; just a handful of large ships blanketed by an abundance of corvettes and escort craft. They were the first to be struck, followed by a precision strike against the largest ship‚Äôs engines. Those she deemed as unimportant were promptly discarded with the coordination of bombers that carried enough ordnance to take them out with as little as one or two torpedoes; decimating them completely.

As for the enemy, their cannons couldn‚Äôt reach beyond a million kilometers, dissipating within the vacuum of space before making any meaningful contact. In reality, it was disappointing that she would rather give credit to the Sellian invasion fleet than whatever it is she went against. But even for her, that bar was low.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre still on the line,‚Äù she said, eyeing the Toskan whose expression was one of dread and despair, having lost the majority of his fleet in the matter of several minutes. ‚ÄúI was expecting more of a fight, but this is nothing more than stomping a newborn pup to death. I appreciate you for wasting my time‚Ä¶‚Äù

She then cut communication with the Toskan, not knowing his name or affiliation, but decided to leave that to a force on board that was beginning to drive her own crew insane.

‚ÄúGrace,‚Äù she said, addressing the man who gave general orders and advisory caution to their fleet. He turned to her. ‚ÄúIssue a boarding task for Raptor Company‚Äôs Foxtrot platoon, on the double. I want that thing in cuffs by the time I finish my coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready done, Skipper.‚Äù he replied swiftly. Turning next to one of the several lower enlisted who sought to learn their jobs as a helmsman, she asked of them a simple request.

‚ÄúY-yes Ma‚Äôam?‚Äù they answered meekly.

And without missing a beat, she ordered of them to make coffee, eyeing the machine not four feet behind her that sat on a shelf that sat empty and cold. As she waited, a notification came through to her smaller screen. Upon it, the rank and name of the individual was revealed; displayed as ‚ÄòSGT. TRISCO‚Äô.

When she accepted his call, the visage of a male in his late twenties answered, with his hair cut to a high-and-tight regulation. He donned a set of gear reminiscent of the old Raider armor, but featured improvements in material, weight, and overall design.

‚ÄúFoxtrot is ready Ma‚Äôam. Just tell us when.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one ship, and I want its captain alive. I'm forwarding an image for a positive ID, everything else can go as you see fit. I don‚Äôt care how you do it, but get me that captain.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it, Ma‚Äôam,‚Äù he replied with zero hesitation. He then turned to the group of similarly dressed individuals before cutting Comms as he addressed them amidst the sound of alarms. ‚ÄúYou all know the music, it‚Äôs time to dance; I hope you all know how to tango!‚Äù

The call cut, leaving only the dance of holograms and notifications to fill the bridge‚Äôs ambience.

‚ÄúPeachy bunch, aren‚Äôt they.‚Äù Yamato said with a small chuckle. ‚ÄúTake off their armor, and you‚Äôd barely be able to tell them apart from the Marines.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù returned Zuna as she looked upon a projection on one of the many monitors aboard the bridge; watching as a high-fidelity viewing the crumbling Toskan party was reduced to flame and vacuum alike.

‚ÄúBut my taste seems to fall in with the Raiders‚Ä¶‚Äù said Zuna as several ships departed from her ship. ‚ÄúMake sure to notify the Marine Expeditionary Unit of possible enemy contact. If they found us, who knows what might run into them‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yamato nodded as she began to disseminate warnings to the self-reliant, forward deployed expedition unit as they continued operations of securing the Toskan transfer hubs. As a result of the sudden incursion, security was tightened, and requests for the station to be made were hastened. She didn‚Äôt like the fact of being out here alone, especially without a station where she could relax and take time off in attire that wasn‚Äôt mandated by the military.

With the creation of the station, she, and much of her own fleet, would be able to rotate having to be aboard a ship. It was one of the many instances that sailors longed for in a port, a place for them to relax while not burdened entirely by military regulation. Of course, she had other reasons to hasten its completion; reasons she kept to herself. Yet still, until it was complete, Zuna was subjected to the system‚Äôs defense while her Marine detachment conducted their mission separate of her own.

As she pondered their situation out in the dark reaches of space, she was met with a warm cup of light-brown coffee, filled with sugar and milk, just as she liked it, but before she could take a sip, she received a notification upon her personal screen from Sergeant Trisco. Accepting it, she was met with a helmeted individual covered in blood not his own, and in the background, Raiders kicking the bound Toskan crew members into submission.

‚ÄúObjective complete, Ma‚Äôam. We also were able to capture some of the bridge crew along with their captain. What do you want us to do with them?‚Äù

She looked around the room for a moment, gauging the reactions of her crew members. They didn‚Äôt have a say in her final decisions, but did sometimes sway her decision based on their reactions. They had overheard her conversation, but that was intentional, as their expressions were furrowed brows and vengeful glares; she had her answer.

‚ÄúExecute the rest, but take custody of their Captain. Connect a siphoning receiver to their data terminal when you‚Äôre done and Mori will take care of the rest.‚Äù He gave a quick nod, turning fast to the Raiders behind him that held their rifles pointed to their captives.

‚ÄúAlright, waste ‚Äòem. And remember, no trophies‚Ä¶‚Äù He said, which was immediately followed up a mix of muffled and sharp cracks from both suppressed and unsuppressed rifles before cutting his connection.

Once silence regained control of the bridge to its harmonious hum, she began to drink her coffee; leaning back into her seat as she stared into the void, unbothered by the execution she had just witnessed.

‚ÄúJust a bit longer‚Ä¶‚Äù she mumbled in the silence of the now cautious bridge, not letting more than small murmurs escape the crew member‚Äôs mouths.

But as she wallowed in the presence of silence, a small beep sounded from her personal device, from an unfamiliar designation. She opened it, thinking of it to be a message from within the ship, but found an image with text placed upon it with an opaque background.

It was of O'Brian speaking down to an individual donned in the new naval field service attire, but wore upon their chest a Marine issued armored vest. His armor was stained in the blood of his enemies, while the other was relatively well-kept. The marks upon their arm was that of an ensign, but to her, that wasn‚Äôt the issue. It was the fact that the one he spoke with was female, and a Sellian to boot.

‚Äò*I fear you may be in competition‚Ä¶ but luckily, ol ‚ÄôCap seems to have his eyes set on a platinum haired Commander‚Ä¶ but who knows‚Ä¶ best of luck.*

*Respectfully,*

*E.‚Äô*

The message was a blatant disregard of professional courtesy and chain of command, but figured that it had to be someone close to him. However, she wasn‚Äôt about to jump to a conclusion, as she found it would be uncouth. To settle her day, she requested a favor from her artificial companion who appeared on her podium beside her.

‚ÄúYes, Madam Wolf?‚Äù

‚ÄúI received a message, unsanctioned. I want the originator found, and get me information regarding this, woman‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, noting the pastel pink skinned Sellian donned in naval attire and armor.

She nodded upon receiving her orders, bowing slightly, but spoke before fully dissipating, ‚ÄúShall I request for the elimination of the Sellian?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that won‚Äôt be necessary. Just find me who sent it, and who this Sellian is,‚Äù she said, watching as the AI disappeared. She had an idea of whom it might be, but wanted to be certain. Looking upon the photo once more, her drive for competition rose.

In a soft tone, she made a quiet declaration amidst the carnage of an enemy she found to be of little worth; speaking instead to her new priority that overtook her central duties.

‚ÄúSorry, sweetheart, but he‚Äôs not yours‚Ä¶‚Äù

Even amidst her mountainous task of the system‚Äôs security, she would return her mind to what she longed for the most; a man whose mettle has been tested and who continues to be forged in the battlefields beyond their home.

But as she thought on the sudden message from the unknown source, her executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Grace, called to her.

‚ÄúSkipper, we received notice from headquarters, your ears only. I've already redirected it your stateroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen was it sent?‚Äù she asked as she rose from her chair.

‚ÄúAbout two weeks ago,‚Äù he replied nonchalantly as she left the bridge.

Zuna was acutely aware of their capability for interplanetary communications, but even she knew its limits. It was all thanks to the advent of the Slip-Space Laser Network Array, that they could keep in touch with further colonies, but with it, the delay gray. First it would take several minutes, then to days, eventually forcing many to to make video messages rather than real-time calls. But most of that delay was alleviated with both a planetary and orbital laser arrays working in tandem. Without those two, if they had to rely solely on ship systems, they would be left with nothing but video messages. Zuna disliked this, as vital information that could potentially provide change the tide of a battle, much less a war, was beholden to time.

Due to this, Naval Combat Doctrine had to make up for this, and commanders such as herself, were given authority akin to a planetary governor; albeit relegated strictly to their own ship.

As she entered her room, the lights in the room lit up to a soft glow, before stopping from getting any brighter. From a nearby pedestal with an onyx top, M√≥rr√≠gan appeared besides a large reflective panel that was bolted in her common area.

‚ÄúMadam Wolf, the origin of the message comes from the Admiral of the Navy. It appears to be an update on your mission. Would you like me to play it?‚Äù

Zuna nodded, and the blackened panel lit up to life with a familiar face; her father. He spoke with a calm demeanor and cold stature as he peered into the screen, knowing well that she wouldn't see the video until time has passed.

'*Commander Zuna Wolf, of the TRSC Phantom Queen and Commander of the 4th O.E.U. Authorization Code: Alpha-Sierra-Delta-1156.* 

*Mission parameters have shifted slightly for operation in the Atlas Region. We received intel that a force is in search beyond the region for friendly forces. Something has them riled up, but we can't afford to pull our forces out now, not when we're so close to finding our people. It's been decided among the Senate that the TRU Task Force has gathered enough intel for a preemptive strike against a stronghold of sorts that acts as a central trading hub for the Toskan Slaver Guilds. We have coordinated with the field team for our moment to strike, but it will not commence until your Sellian Navy Support arrives. So you're aware, Chief-Commander Gruda will be your contact regarding this joint operation‚Ä¶'*

She didn't like the thought of having a former enemy beside her in their own warships, since the last thing she wants to deal with is being shot in the back. The video continued.

*'‚Ä¶I know what you're thinking, but the crew of this support attachment has been stripped of their most offensive armaments. Best they can offer in lieu is mechanical repair and point defense. Part of the crew is Stellar Navy, so don't go blowing them up‚Ä¶'* he said, as if having read her mind two weeks ago.

*'I'll end it here, Zuna. This operation, which we're dubbing 'Vicious Recourse', is to be swift and lethal. We don't have room for prisoners, only those held captive. You are to deem all ships not emitting the proper designation indicators, they are to be destroyed. And don't worry about your post in Atlas, we'll get you covered.* 

*With Calm Stars and Safe Travels.'*

The video ended, leaving the screen black after M√≥rr√≠gan shut it off.

‚ÄúThat authorization code‚Ä¶ finally, retribution for the kin of my creators,‚Äù said the virtual companion in a soft but bloodthirsty tone.

‚ÄúIn any case, it makes things easier,‚Äù replied Zuna as she took a moment to rest and digest her new mission objective. It was to be harsh and bloody, leaving no room for enemy survivors.

‚ÄúAttack, Search, and Destroy‚Ä¶‚Äù mumbled Zuna. ‚ÄúNow that's a doctrine I can get behind. Mori, run a diagnostics on our weapons and ordnance. I want to make sure we won't run into any problems when we enter combat.‚Äù She said, as she rose to regain her spot aboard the bridge.

‚ÄúOf course, Madam. And what of your previous inquiry into the unknown Sellian?‚Äù

She paused before answering with reluctance, ‚ÄúI suppose it can wait. The mission comes first, and I know my Fae; he's not so easily swayed by those who haven't captured his heart. If his heart is made of iron, then I am his blacksmith,‚Äù she said confidently as the door to her room shut.

As she entered the bridge, curious eyes laid upon her as she regained her seat. Small murmurs were heard throughout the bridge, but with the hum of electronics and the ship itself, drowned them out into silence.

Understanding of their curiosity, she addressed them calmly, ‚ÄúWe've received an update to our mission. We will strike at the enemy for our lost brethren, both Sellian and Terran alike. This mission will be sent as a message for the perpetrators in association with the old council. For many, this may be your first combat deployment, but those who have served during the war that's still fresh in our memory, do as you did and show no mercy. Now carry on with your duties.‚Äù

They returned tot heir work with a new-found vitality as the commotion on the bridge rose. Curious, Grace and the other officers turned to Zuna who returned to her personal device.

‚ÄúIf you don't mind me asking, Skipper, what was in that message?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the go ahead to conduct our first real assault behind alien lines. I don't know what we'll find, but expect chaos.‚Äù He just smiled to her words as he returned to work.

But before they would all return to their duties, Zuna offered a final set of wisdom upon her subordinates before committing to their mission, ‚Äúprepare to harden your hearts, for we are about to consign judgment on the peddlers of our friends and family. Be prepared for anything‚Ä¶‚Äù

1ixpkoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ixpkoz/aio_spouses_work_meeting_date/,AIO- spouse's 'work meeting' / date?,"Not posting in r/AITA, because I know I am.  But I want to know if I'm overreacting, too.   
  
Partially separated from spouse of a decade as we sort some things out, figure out what path we want to take.

She wanted to transition the relationship to ENM.  I wanted to do couples therapy first- she kinda plowed ahead. On recommendation of couples therapist, we both agreed to not see other people while we sorted things out.  She kinda... well, she took 5 months to ""wrap things up"" with her ""not a boyfriend,"" but only ""seeing him as a friend and for professional services.""  ""As a friend"" meant going out drinking with him and having dinner now and then, and ""for professional services"" mean nude massages (he's a masseuse).  Eye roll.    


Anyways, I expressed how much this hurt and how it felt unfair; she insisted it was really no big deal.

We separated during this time, and I was the one fighting for the relationship; doing what she asked, trying to improve myself and my contributions to the relationship (get a better handle on my ADHD, improve my career).  She wasn't sure whether she wanted to come back to the relationship... and eventually, I told her no worries, then; I'm done, I'm out, I can't keep chasing someone who isn't emotionally responsive to my asks and who doesn't really seem to want me.

180 from her:   
She's insisted that she's come back around, wants to save it, has decided she really just wants to be monogamous with me, isn't seeing anyone else or going to try to, etc.  Still not addressing my table stakes requests about addressing our intimacy issues, etc. But at least being friendly, and wanting it.

Ok, whatever.  There's the setup. 



  


Valentines day.  We'd agreed that since things had been kinda hot lately... we'd just play it low key.  Eventually decided on going out to dinner with our young kids, as a family (they're school age where valentines day is the fun school holiday, excited about making cards, etc).  It seemed very sweet, and something nice we could all celebrate together and agree on.

  
A few days before V day, she asks if I mind if she takes a client meeting on that afternoon or evening (she's a real estate agent).  She said she wanted to check in because she didn't want me to feel snubbed, but there was an important client meeting she kinda needed to have.  Also clarifying: heyo, this is a client meeting that just needs to happen on Valentines day, NOT a date, lol.  I say absolutely, go for it, I'm not an asshole.

It comes up again the day before; just double checking, you're cool, if you hear about me being out at a cafe with a client it's for a coffee meeting about something! You know, when I'm out for showings with male clients, everyone always assumes we're a couple! Ok sure, of course, do your meeting, whatever.

Day of: she goes out the door.  Dinnertime to meet up rolls around... I start texting.  Ugh, time is getting late; we're going to barely have time at the restaurant before closing, and the kids are going to be late to bed.  :/ 

Somewhere along the evening... something feels wrong in my gut.  I can't pin it down, but I get a tingle.

I text her to say hey, no worries, I bet your meeting is running late and important.  I'll make dinner with the kids at your house; you just come back when you do, I'll have something nice waiting.  About half an hour later she texts back: ""On my way, meet you at the restaurant!""

We all meet there, have dinner.  She shows up and is super happy, dressed really nicely, doesn't eat much: ""oh, the work meeting involved food.""  I ask, non-proddingly, about the client meeting, did it go well?  ""Oh yes, it went well. The client and I got a lot done, a lot to talk about.""  She changes the subject. 

We all go home.  



I AM THE ASSHOLE, AND AM I OVERREACTING?

I wake up the next morning, and my gut sinks.  I know her client meeting was not a client meeting. 

I'm at her house with the kids, and I... I'm a coward. I could have just addressed her directly, asked.  But I didn't.  I walked into her bedroom, violated her privacy like a bastard, and flipped open her diary.

Feb 14:  
yada yada yada kids   
Coffee + dinner with Curt at his apartment. Really refreshing, and looked like a date #### (unreadable).  Hope feels good.  Move towards best self.  
PS: Martin redecorated his house per my comments  


  
Backstory:   
Curt is a client of hers... who I know by name, who she had expressed wanting to date back in the ENM discussion days.  I've met the guy. I've given him a tour of (what used to be my and is now just her) house.  He's come up in discussion many, many times, both as a client of hers and also someone she's interested in.  The fact that she didn't mention his name specifically in anything around this feels like... I could see it as her trying to avoid conflict unnecessarily, but it feels like a lie of omission. 

Martin is another client of hers... who I know by name, because she's also expressed deep longing for, and she's stayed at his house out of town while on work trips a couple of times.  Insists it is always just b/c he has a guest bedroom, yada yada.  eyeroll.



So yes.  I read her fucking diary.  I'm a bastard. 

I don't feel like this was a ""work meeting."" Ok, maybe it was a casual client meeting to catch up on some projects or something, but... the omission of his name the whole time is ACTUALLY what makes it feel sus. Even if it \*was\* just some professional discussion, it feels dishonest.  

I feel like this was the last straw for me; I don't feel like I can trust... and I don't feel like there's anything to be gained by trying to work this out.  10 years and two kids, but... to be honest, I haven't brought it up because... if this is what she feels like she needs to be happy, then fuck it.  be happy.  just be happy without me, please and thank you.

He walks up to the counter and immediately demands, ""I want a free coffee. I‚Äôve been coming here for years, and I‚Äôm loyal to this place, so I deserve it.""

Now, we don‚Äôt do ""free coffee"" unless it's a special promo, and I kindly explained that to him. Bob wasn‚Äôt having it. He starts going off, saying, ‚ÄúWhen I was your age, we didn‚Äôt have to deal with corporate greed. You guys are ripping people off!‚Äù and all of that typical ""back in my day"" rhetoric.

I still try to be polite, but he insists that, because he‚Äôs a ""regular"" (he came in about once a month, mind you), he‚Äôs entitled to a freebie. He demands to speak to the manager, so I go to fetch her.

The manager‚Äîwho's been there longer than I have‚Äîcomes over and politely tells Bob the same thing: no free coffee unless there‚Äôs a promotion. Bob then starts ranting about how we don‚Äôt appreciate ""loyal customers"" like him. He says, ""In my day, customer service was better, and people had respect!""

After about five minutes of him shouting about how coffee shops today are ""too woke"" and how we‚Äôre all ruining the world, he throws a $20 bill at the counter and walks out without his coffee, muttering something about how he's ""never coming back to this establishment.""

Of course, he didn‚Äôt even wait for the change.

Hey Reddit fam! Are you dreaming of a living room makeover but worried about the cost? I feel you! But guess what? You can give your living room a fresh new look without emptying your wallet. Here are some awesome tips from Belffin on how to choose budget - friendly yet stylish furniture for your living room.



Set a Realistic Budget and Stick to It

The first step in any budget - friendly furniture shopping is to set a clear budget. Decide how much you're willing to spend on each piece, like the sofa, coffee table, and side chairs. This will help you narrow down your options and prevent you from overspending. At Belffin, we have a wide range of furniture in different price ranges, so you're sure to find something that fits your budget.

Look for Affordable Styles that Don't Compromise on Aesthetic

You don't have to sacrifice style for affordability. There are plenty of budget - friendly furniture styles that can make your living room look amazing. For example, a mid - century modern - inspired sofa can add a touch of retro charm without costing a fortune. Look for pieces with simple, clean lines and neutral colors. These styles are not only in vogue but also versatile, allowing you to accessorize with more affordable decor items to change the look of the room as you like.

Consider Second - Hand and DIY Options

One great way to save money is to look for second - hand furniture. You can find some real gems at thrift stores, garage sales, or online marketplaces. With a little bit of love and some DIY skills, you can transform an old piece into a unique and stylish addition to your living room. For example, you can repaint an old coffee table or re - upholster a worn - out chair. And if you're not into DIY, Belffin also offers some budget - friendly new furniture that looks as good as the more expensive counterparts.

Mix High - and Low - Cost Pieces Strategically

Don't feel like you have to buy everything at the cheapest price. Instead, focus on investing in a few high - quality, essential pieces like a comfortable sofa. Then, you can balance it out with more affordable items. For instance, you can pair a Belffin high - quality sofa with some inexpensive side tables or floor lamps. This way, you get the best of both worlds: durability and style without spending a fortune.

So, there you have it! These are some great ways to revamp your living room on a budget. If you've tried any of these tips or have your own money - saving furniture shopping stories, share them in the comments.

Hey Reddit, I'm Dan. You might know me as the guy who wears a hard hat with a digital countdown timer and carries emergency funding in a glass case. If you don't know me yet, set a timer for 2 minutes because that's how long it'll take for me to change how you think about construction financing.

**Quick backstory:** 6 years ago, I was you. Project manager for a mid-sized commercial contractor. Had 22 guys on payroll and a massive school renovation lined up. All I needed was the bank to process our construction loan on time.

Narrator: *They did not process it on time.*

Lost the project. Lost my crew. Lost my house. All because some loan officer took a 3-week vacation during ""processing."" By the time I got approved, my GC had given the job to someone else.

**Plot twist:** Best thing that ever happened to me.

Now I help contractors get funding in hours instead of weeks. While your bank loan application is collecting dust, I'm getting crews back to work. I've funded 347 contractors in less time than it takes the average loan officer to return a phone call.

Some fun facts about me that absolutely nobody asked for:

* I time EVERYTHING. My kids joke that I'd time how long it takes to time things. They're not wrong.
* I have a Doberman named Overtime who has his own tiny hard hat.
* My house renovation is perpetually 70% complete. Classic cobbler's children situation.
* I can't watch movies over 100 minutes. Life's too short and most directors need better editors.
* I once completed a sprint triathlon in the exact time I predicted, down to the second. This remains my greatest personal achievement.
* I drink my coffee so fast the mug doesn't have time to get cold.
* I do stand-up comedy on weekends about construction and time management. It's basically therapy that other people laugh at.
* My dating profile says ""must be punctual"" in the non-negotiables. My ex-wife says that's why I'm still single. She's not wrong.

Here's what I'm doing on Reddit:

1. **Posting ""Financial SOS"" stories** \- Real contractors I've helped rescue from time-sensitive disasters.
2. **Calling out ""Time Theft""** \- Exposing how traditional financing literally steals time and money from your business.
3. **Hosting ""Rapid Fire AMAs""** \- Where I answer any construction financing question in 60 seconds or less.
4. **Sharing ""Financial First Aid""** \- Emergency protocols for when shit hits the fan on a project.

Why I'm really here:

Because in the time it took you to read this post, somewhere a contractor lost a deposit, missed a material price lock-in, or had to tell their crew ""checks might be late this week.""

That shit keeps me up at night. It should keep banks up too, but they're sleeping just fine while you're staring at the ceiling wondering how you'll make payroll.

**The clock's always ticking in this business.** I'm just the guy crazy enough to wear it on his hard hat.

Tick tock, Dan

-Caffeine: Slight increase in caffeine intake. Usually sticking to 1-2 coffees a day, now its never enough. Found swapping a flavored zero kcal energy drink for one of the coffee helps it last longer and satisfy the craving for a flavor.
-Irritable: Bit short with people at work and in life. Honestly staying away has worked for me. I love my time alone so staying a bit more to myself while i go through this is ok to me.

# How to Use MovieReelAI

Using MovieReelAI is very simple. Let me explain the basic steps:

# Step 1: Write Your Script

Start by writing your idea in simple text. This could be a script, a concept, or even a list of ideas. The better you describe your idea, the more accurate the final video will be.

# Step 2: Choose Your Style

Next, select the animation style you like from over 50 options. You can experiment with different formats to see what fits your content best. Whether you want a modern cinematic look or a creative comic style, the choice is yours.

# Step 3: Customize Your Video

MovieReelAI allows you to adjust individual elements of your video. You can change the characters, adjust the camera angles, and tweak the scenes until they look just right. This customization means your video will be unique and tailored to your story.

# Step 4: Add Audio and Final Touches

Now, add the voice-over and background music. You can either record your own voice or use the AI-generated narration. The tool also lets you adjust the volume and timing of the music to ensure it complements the visuals.

# Step 5: Export and Share

Once you‚Äôre happy with your video, export it in the desired format. MovieReelAI works with various formats so that you can share your creation across different social media platforms or even on your website.

Using MovieReelAI is like following a simple recipe. You add your ingredients (script, style, audio), let the machine do its magic, and eat your delicious video creation.

# My Case Study as a Beta Tester

I had the chance to try MovieReelAI before its official launch as a beta tester, and it changed the way I see video creation. I remember the first time I used the tool. I wrote down a simple story idea and selected a cinematic style that I thought would be appealing. Within minutes, the AI had turned my words into a complete storyboard, and I could see visuals coming together on the screen.

During the beta trial, I created a series of short videos that explained different topics for my digital marketing blog. The process was smooth. I adjusted the scenes as needed and added voice-over to make the videos sound engaging. To my surprise, one of the videos generated over 100,000 views within a week. This immediate success reinforced the potential of MovieReelAI.

I also found the interface welcoming and easy to navigate, even for someone with minimal video editing experience. It saved me a lot of time, and I was able to produce several videos that I later used to boost my online traffic. This experience solidified my belief in the product, and I am confident that many others will also find success with it.

The weird thing is, he's not exactly ""nice"", but he's not violent.

I've seen him interacting with some really obnoxious people. Just... they give you a headache. They give me a headache, they give him a headache (although, I think he's being a little melodramatic about it... or maybe he's just mocking them), but it wasn't until a couple of months ago that he started to become openly hostile and threatening toward them.

Like, I had some guy playing lottery tickets. I'm ringing up vampire guy, and lottery guy just keeps interrupting... dude has already been there half an hour, and he just keeps scratching away, and trying to put me in shotgun on his fantastic journey to blowing his whole paycheck on tickets, having just enough for some junk food and a 6-pack, and leaving...

Anyway, so vampire guy starts making fun of him, and the dude tells him to ""go back to Australia""...

Well, Vampure guy loses his shit shit, goes full ""vamp-face"", and tells the dude ""he'd suck every last drop from his body, but it would be like trying to drink a milkshake through a coffee straw""...

I just totally lost it...

But the point is, the dude was running out of there, and vampire guy told him that he could call the cops, but it was just going to end up with him inside of a padded room...

And it kinda got me thinking: ""would that really happen?"" 

Honestly? I dont think that vampire-guy was that off-base.

It seems like a vampire report should be credible around here, and yet, the authorities never seem to take any of it seriously.

Don't get me wrong, I have mixed feelings about vampires. Most of them are awful, violent sociopaths. But I've met a couple of cool ones here and there....

But I think that what bothers me is the feeling that I'm being gaslit into not even acknowledging their existence.

The fact is, that decent vampires are the exception, and even though vampires are literally all over the place, you only get like maybe a handful our of every 50 people that even want to acknowledge they exist.

Not saying that lottery guy should've called the cops on vampire guy... vampire guy is WAY less annoying... but it DID bother me that vampire guy was right about the authorities locking the dude up for reporting it..m which is crazy, because me and that guy discuss him being a vampire openly all the time.",3,1740466992.0,sunnydalecommunity,5,1.0,False

1ixp2u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/niseko/comments/1ixp2u2/my_first_time_experience_and_tips_for_visiting/,My first time experience and tips for visiting Niseko,"I spent five days at Niseko and stayed in Hirafu in February 2025 using the [IKON Base Pass](https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes/ikon-base-pass). This was my first time. I hope these notes and tips may be helpful to those looking to visit for the first time. I'm happy to answer any questions.

**Getting to Niseko**

I landed in Narita and stayed the night at a hotel next to Narita Airport. The next day I took a local flight from Narita Airport on Jetstar to New Chitose Airport and then the [White Liner shuttle bus](https://goodsports.co.jp/white_eng/ski-bus/) directly to Hirafu. If you‚Äôre staying in Hirafu, I recommend this bus since it‚Äôs direct and takes approximately 2.5 hours to the [Hirafu Welcome Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YR1Sw3Nk3rymzxiK8). Other shuttle companies have multiple stops and the journey is longer.   
  
IMPORTANT: I highly recommend you reserve your shuttle bus ticket in advance as they will most likely be sold out if you try to buy a ticket the same day. 

**Leaving Niseko**  
  
I took the White Liner shuttle bus directly to New Chitose Airport. This time I had a flight the same day to Haneda (JAL) and a connecting flight (Delta) to my final destination. Note, if you have a connecting flight [going from Domestic to International](https://tokyo-haneda.com/en/flight/transit/dms_int.html), you will need to take a shuttle to the International terminal, check in again at Haneda, and go through security. Luckily my snowboard connected all the way through, and I didn‚Äôt have to grab it at Haneda. Otherwise you will need to grab it at Haneda.. 

**For IKON Pass holders**

Your season pass card will work immediately with all four resorts and the [Niseko United Shuttle Bus](https://www.niseko.ne.jp/en/niseko-access/). Just go directly to the lifts. No need to activate or get a new card or ticket. 

**Staying in Hirafu**

Hirafu is separated into Upper and Lower Hirafu and is situated on a slope. You will be walking uphill  most of the time. The bigger hotels (ski in and ski out) are in Upper Hirafu. Lower Hirafu has a combination of smaller hotels, private residences, and restaurants. I stayed in Lower Hirafu just off Yotei-Zaka St. It was about a 19 minute walk to the base the Ace Gondola from my hotel. Both the Niseko United Shuttle Bus and Hirafu Free Shuttle Bus have a stop at [Hirafu Junction](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GXy8ns5s1kwuWVeU6) (road that separates Upper and Lower Hirafu) right next to Seicomart. This is the stop I used to most.

**Weather**

When I was there, the weather changed quickly in a matter of hours. It could be sunny or partly cloudy, and then all the sudden it starts to snow for a few hours both in Hirafu and on the mountain. Layering is key. 

If you are walking around, especially Lower Hirafu, the roads can become icy and very slippery at night. I saw a few car accidents and lots of people slipping and falling hard. So much that I thought of starting a Kookslams Niseko account!

**Transportation in Niseko**

You can take the [Niseko United Shuttle Bus](https://www.niseko.ne.jp/en/niseko-access/), which goes to all four resorts and the nearby city of Kutchan. IKON pass holders can ride for free. Just show your pass as you exit the bus.

There‚Äôs also the [Hirafu Free Shuttle Bus](https://hirafufreebus.com/top) that goes around Hirafu and at night goes to Kutchan, which is nice if you want to explore the town for dinner.

**Which Resort Should You Ride?**

Since I had the IKON base pass, which included five free days, I was able to try all four resorts. There is an excellent video on YouTube ([Choose Your Ideal Niseko Resort: The Ultimate Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oecpCHSEPYU&t=1230s) that summarizes the pros and cons of each resort. It can get windy, and when it does, many of the lifts at the top of the mountain get shut down. You can check the lift status for all resorts using the Niseko United app.

Hirafu is the most popular resort and thus usually the most crowded. Seasonal workers get a free pass at this resort, which contributes to the crowds. However, some of the most famous runs (Strawberry Fields and Miharashi) are accessible directly from here.

Annupuri and Grand Niseko have more families on the slopes. However, Gate 1 and Gate 8 in Annupuri have some amazing runs through the famous white birch trees. 

Hanazono has more advanced runs. 

If you have to pick one mountain and you are an intermediate to advanced rider, I would recommend Hirafu.

I found this video on YouTube to be an excellent guide finding powder runs: [Niseko Peak Secrets: The Ultimate Guide to Epic Powder Runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oUAA5o78ZU&t=516s)

**Food**

Hokkaido is famous for dairy, king crab, soup curry, lamb (low odor and lean meat), and more. There is a famous local dairy farm nearby called [Takahashi Dairy Farm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tRajYj8nLUggx8RH9). You can find some of their products at the convenience stores and supermarkets.

Seicomart is a local Hokkaido convenience store chain with local products. You can grab a quick pre-made meal here and save money. Convenience stores in Japan have very good food. Not like in the US.

There is a Lawsons close by, which is big national Japanese convenience store chain, but the selection of drinks and food items is not nearly as good.

If you really want to visit a 7 Eleven to see what all the hype is about, there is one just outside of Hirafu. 

**Restaurants** 

Most restaurants will require a reservation and many can be done online. However, some will only take reservations over the phone. There are also places that are walk in only (see below). Some people will say to use Tabelog to find recommendations, which is like the Japanese version of Yelp, but I found Google Maps worked just as well. 

Food trucks are everywhere and can be a cheaper alternative, but you will need to eat outside in the cold or bring it back to your room.

Lots of people also go to nearby supermarkets such as [MaxValu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i2BpkV2BWwPDDEsv7) and [Lucky](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D9Ha2uVePB4nSv8z9) to stock up on groceries to cook. You can also get really cheap sushi and pre-made meals here. For example, you can get six pieces of Chutoro at Lucky for 1,280 yen!

Here are a few restaurants I really liked and some I wanted to check out, but didn‚Äôt have time.

In Hirafu:

[Yakiniku Genghis Khan Yakiniku Yotei YOTEIZAN](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Vxyzys5UDTZKXPJH8) (reservations needed, can be done online). Japanese BBQ. Went here twice.

[Ichi Sushi and Sake Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/75dT64YesD1o1GBT7) (no reservations needed, credit card only). A small hidden gem with great sushi. 

[Green Farm Deli Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5xmu8wnKwKAHUrR6) (no reservations needed). A nice place to grab a coffee, lunch, or a snack and chill. Note, Hirafu does not have many coffee shops where you can sit and hang out.

[Nook Annupuri Center House Cafeteria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MtzoypHtbWtzzRvq7) (bottom of Annupuri mountain). The infamous King crab ramen here was excellent!

[Tsubara Tsubara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPGe71apWcrkgdUd9) (reservations by phone only, or walk in). I didn‚Äôt have a chance to check them out, but they serve the famous Hokkaido Soup curry here. 

[Yakitori Yamanchu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aXvmiaT1YxpnsQ3P7) (no reservations needed). I wanted to try this place, but it's a very small and the waitlist was way too long.

In Kutchan:  
  
[Nakama Ramen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tfeDXtULNewzW3GF8) (no reservations needed, cash only). Traditional family owned ramen shop. Family loves above the shop. Cash only. If you want a taste for real local ramen, hit up this spot. This was recommended by many of the Japanese local workers. It's not gonna blow your mind, but worth a try if you are in Kutchan. 

**Souvenirs** 

For local Hokkaido snacks and candy, Seicomart in Hirafu has a small dedicated section right as you walk in. Supermarkets also have a dedicated section for local products. 

[Rhythm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ggZo1PMUngr7CANz8) (main location next to Burton) has a nice selection of Niseko t-shirts, hoodies, and locally made wooden Niseko magnets (near the cash register). There are several locations around Hirafu, make sure to go to the main location.

Below [Tanta An](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PmGxCvASuGEqxHyz9) (next to King Gondola) on the first floor there is a small store with a nice selection of locally made Niseko wooden magnets, hats, stickers, and t-shirts, and hoodies.

[Green Farm Deli Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5xmu8wnKwKAHUrR6) has a nice selection of local coffees, chocolates, and jams. 

[North Face](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iRUCa5kkerj1rUWw9) has a small selection of Niseko hoodies and t-shirts. Warning, they are very expensive. Hoodies were around $100 USD. They also carry the North Face Purple Label collection, which is a clothing line only available in Japan. If you're a big fan of North Face, check this place out.

1ixp28e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1ixp28e/not_a_love_letter/,Not a love letter!,"Women of coconad, what would be your response if you get the below letter from a  dude!?

- Not a Love Letter -

Sabse pehle, don‚Äôt freak out! This isn‚Äôt a termination letter or a love letter. So, breathe. Chill. No drama here.

But yeah, this is a letter. And I genuinely believe letters feel more personal when read slowly, preferably when you‚Äôre alone, soaking in the moment like a main character in a coming-of-age movie.

The last time I wrote a letter was in 2009, and that too, to my grandpa who was 65 at that time. Imagine, a 65 year old man, sitting in his lazy ass chair in a cozy evening, sipping tea and writing replies to a 10 year old kid. I can picture a smile in his face, and that‚Äôs out of pure love. Back then we use to talk about Ramayana and hanuman. Fast forward to now, and our conversations have somehow pivoted to philosophy and movies. Oh, and he‚Äôs really into AI these days. Poor guy is just praying AI doesn‚Äôt kick my ass out of relevance. LOL.

Anyway, here‚Äôs what I know about you,

1. Your name.
2. Where you work &
3. The cool fact that you‚Äôre Sri Lankan.

And now, you‚Äôre probably thinking, Why the hell is this person writing me a whole-ass letter when they know, like, three things about me?

Fair question.

Honestly? The whole point of this was just to make you smile. That‚Äôs it. No hidden motives. No secret agendas. Just one human trying to make another human feel appreciated. Ngl, I was super skeptical about this whole letter thing, like, What if she finds this cringe? What if this makes her uncomfy? What if I‚Äôve just committed some kind of social crime?

But then I thought, YOLO!!. So why not? Right?

Coming back to you, I don‚Äôt know, something about you feels familiar. You give off this kind person aura, you seems like you appreciate things in life. Something, I rarely see in this Jaga. And that's purely my gut feeling and I bet my life on it. So yeah, I would very much like to know you, be your friend and maybe someday, something more. Hehe XD

So that‚Äôs all, this letter is a little hello from someone who thinks you‚Äôre interesting and might just be a good friend waiting to happen. 

Now, the real question: Filter coffee over the weekend or masala dosa? Or maybe both?

What if you‚Äôre already seeing someone? Yikes, that could be awkward‚Ä¶ but hey, no worries! Just lemme know & say a simple hello once in a blue moon. Promise, I won‚Äôt make it weird. I will go back to the shadows ASAP!

And hey, if this wasn‚Äôt totally cringe and you didn‚Äôt immediately report me for spam, maybe write back?

Until then, don‚Äôt let AI replace you, keep being effortlessly cool, and have an amazing rest of your day.

Madfocuz 

And yeah, I‚Äôm a boring Gen Z & I‚Äôm not on Social Media.
I‚Äôm one of them. Nerd, introverted & interesting.

Focus on the last line, cute lady!

""The Empire has not fallen."" Warmaster Scathach spoke. ""Not yet.""

""The Empire is dead."" Emperor Feln Tybert spoke firmly. ""There is no place for self delusion at the Apex.""

""There are three billion Vrrl hunters in this sector who disagree,"" Scathach argued. ""We've lost much, Emperor. But not all.""

""No, not all,"" Tybert allowed, ""but the Vrrl Starfang Empire?"" He shook his head. ""It will never be what it was after this. Nor should it be. The Empire is gone, Skrell.""

""We can still save it,"" Scathach insisted. ""Now that the Scargiver is here-""

""You misunderstand, old friend."" Tybert cut him off. ""The Empire was already dying. The foundations laid by the First Emperor were imperfect. Starfang did the best he could, but our Mafdet is wrong. Our ways are incorrect. You know this better than I."" He folded four hands behind his back, mirroring the Warmaster's stance. ""The Empire is and should be dead. The only question is what we will build from the ashes.""

""Uh... guys?"" Yvian frowned at the two of them. ""I'm gonna need a little context.""

Tybert turned to look at her. ""It seems I've started a conversation before introductions are complete. How rude of me."" He stepped forward and extended a hand. ""I am Feln Tybert, former Emperor of the Vrrl Starfang Empire. You must be Yvian. Warmaster Scathach speaks of you with the utmost respect.""

Yvian didn't care what Tybert said. The man was a ruler through and through. He had a presence about him. A gravity. It reminded her of King Tallest. She shook his hand. His grip was firm, but not crushing. It was a casual display of control from a creature that could easily break her bones by mistake. ""It's nice to meet you,"" she told him.

""Of course it is,"" said the Emperor. ""Why wouldn't it be?"" Next he turned to Mims. ""You must be Mark Mims. The Scargiver. The human that stands at the Apex.""

""Nice to meet you,"" Mims shook his hand. ""Lissa said good things.""

""As well she should."" The Emperor shook his hand. ""I've heard things about you as well, Scargiver. It's said you've killed more sapients than any other living thing. ""

Kilroy's eyes flashed red for a moment. He'd been very insistent that killing all the Enlightened put his kill count higher than the human's. Yvian thought he would speak up, but he didn't. Oh. Right. None of them were allowed to talk about that stuff.

Emperor Tybert gave the Peacekeeper unit a considering look. ""And last we have Peacekeeper Unit Kilroy. I see congratulations and condolences are in order. Your General Zhukov told me only non-standard units have hatbands.""

""Affirmative."" The machine's eyes were back to a steady solemn blue.

""What about Scarrend?"" Yvian asked. ""Shouldn't you introduce yourself to him, too?""

""Scarrend has known me his whole life, Yvian,"" Tybert informed her. He stepped to the other Vrrl and wrapped him up in a hug. They rubbed cheeks. ""You don't know how good it is to smell you again, boy.""

""I'm happy to smell you too, Emperor,"" said Scarrend.

""You really don't know."" Tybert hugged him harder. ""I grieved for you as I'd grieve for my own son."" He let Scarrend go and stepped back. His eyes were wet. ""To smell you now, alive..."" He hugged the other Vrrl again. ""Don't ever scare us like that again.""

""I'll try not to, Hassath Feln."" Scarrend patted the Emperor on the back. Tybert let go and stepped away, wiping his eyes.

Yvian leaned closer to Lissa and asked quietly, ""Hassath?""

""It means chosen family,"" Lissa explained.

""We were not the only ones that mourned,"" Warmaster Scathach spoke up. ""The whole Empire shut down for three days when we thought you had died.""

""Three days?"" Scarrend blinked. ""For me?""

""You underestimate yourself, Scarrend,"" said Tybert. ""Your holovids on the Way of the Scargiver were being shared across our species, along with most of your reports. Short of myself and the Warmasters, you are our most famous Hunter.""

Scarrend grunted thoughtfully. ""Strange. I had not considered.""

""That does not surprise me,"" Tybert told him. He snorted. ""But that's enough of personal matters. We have more pressing business."" He walked to the head of the conference table and squatted on his haunches. ""Come. Sit. I will tell you of the fall of the Empire.""

Mims, Lissa, and Yvian all got some coffee and sat down. Scarrend and Scathach squatted next to the Emperor. Mims asked, ""So what happened?""

""An uprising."" Emperor Tybert growled. ""Warmaster Tab and Warmaster Sithis led their forces in an attack on Starfang Prime. If that wasn't enough, the common hunters rose up as well. They disabled our planetbound defenses and swarmed the Palace. It was all Skrell could do to get me and my family out.""

""My hunters might have fought off Tab or Sithis. We could have held off both of them together for a time. But the rising of the populace?"" Warmaster Scathach shook his head. ""That was the real blow. Nearly a third of our species is crying for Feln's head as we speak. They're shouting phrases like Make It As It Was and Human In All But Name.""

""Ah, damn."" Mims grimaced. ""Fascist takeover.""

""Fascist?"" Yvian asked.

The human looked at her, then at the Vrrl. He sipped his coffee and took in a breath. ""Alright. Quick civics lesson. Generally speaking, every society has two factions. You've got Progressives who want to change things, and Conservatives who want to keep things the same. Both groups are necessary. The Conservatives act as a stabilizing influence, keeping things from changing too quickly and stopping some of the more detrimental changes from taking root. The Progressives push to improve society, removing injustice or coming up with new ways to do things. In a stable society the groups play off each other, keeping civilization moving forward without letting things get out of hand."" He took another sip. ""When times get hard, one or both groups start to cause problems.""

""What kind of problems?"" Yvian asked. The three Vrrl and Lissa were paying attention, but she got the impression they already knew what Mims was talking about. The human's lesson was mostly for Yvian.

""It varies,"" said the human, ""but one of the more common scenarios is fascism. It's technically a Conservative movement, but it perverts the principles of standard Conservatism. Fascists tend towards extreme nationalism, a single dictatorial authority, forceful suppression of dissent, and a strict social hierarchy.""

""That doesn't sound much different from the Empire in general,"" Yvian pointed out.

""Not on paper,"" said Mims, ""but there are some pretty big differences. The Emperor had supreme authority, but he didn't kill people for disagreeing with him, and Vrrl hierarchy was determined by competence and competence alone. There were laws, and those laws applied to everyone. Now they don't.""

Emperor Tybert looked at the human sharply. ""I didn't tell you that yet, human. How did you know?""

Mims shrugged. ""The core principle of fascism is that there must always be an ingroup and an outgroup. The ingroup gets protected by the law, but not punished. The outgroup gets punished by the law, but not protected. It's one of the reasons fascist nations don't last very long. Every time one outgroup gets destroyed or kicked out, they pick a new one. Fascist countries usually destroy themselves within a decade or two.""

Warmaster Scathach narrowed his eyes. ""You've guessed a great deal with no context. What aren't you telling us, Scargiver?""

Mims met his eyes. His voice was grim. ""Human In All But Name. Make It As It Was. Those are political slogans. Your people aren't and never were a democracy. Tab and Sithis would never have come up with that shit on their own. They're working with someone who knows politics and propaganda. They're working with Reba.""

""Reba,"" Lissa hissed. ""That fucking bitch...""

Yvian cursed as well. Reba had been the source of nearly every problem Yvian had faced in the last few years. The human built Synthetic Intelligence blamed Mims for the death of her family, and she'd spent decades making him suffer for it. Even the apparent death of the human hadn't stopped her from pulling her gribshit behind the scenes.

""It makes sense,"" said the human. ""We tried to help your species. If she really thought we were dead, the petty bitch would have nothing better to do than take down everything we accomplished. If she knew it was a trick, taking you out would weaken us and fuck with our emotions."" He sipped his coffee. ""It's evil, petty, and efficient. Typical Reba.""

""We believe so as well,"" said Scathach. ""Our information is limited, but we believe a large portion of the Empire has been receiving N-mails containing propaganda. The Synthetic was sending them to those Vrrl it deemed were the most susceptible. Catch phrases and wild theories were circulating for months before the attack."" He let out a growling chuff. ""Claims that the Emperor was a pixen puppet, or mating with Lissa Kiver. Some of our people even accused us of faking our war with the humans.""

""Madness."" Emperor Tybert rumbled. ""We tried to track down the source of the rumors, but the digital trail was impossible to follow."" He shook his head. ""It doesn't make sense. The proof of what really happened is there for all to see. Why would anyone choose to believe such obvious lies?""

""Humans have been asking ourselves that for thousands of years,"" said Mims. He shrugged. ""There's a lot of psychology behind it, but the short version is that some people choose to be stupid. They'll choose a narrative they like and actively ignore all evidence to the contrary. Feelings become more important than facts, and people are judged by what they are instead of what they do. Once someone starts thinking that way it's damned near impossible to break them out of it.""

""Madness,"" the Emperor repeated.

""People are like that sometimes."" Mims shrugged again. ""So Tab and Sithis chased you out of the Empire and took over. What happened next?""

""They purged the Empire."" Tybert snarled, flexing his claws. ""Hunters rounded up the Vrrl who spoke against the uprising, or who didn't seem supportive enough of Tab. They called them human lovers, softpaws, and softerpaws. The ones who weren't killed were placed in camps. Lafacdio Tab declared himself Emperor, with Sithis as his Empress.""

""We tried to get our supporters out,"" said Scathach. He sighed. ""It wasn't enough, but we tried.""

""And you all came here,"" Lissa guessed.

""It was the safest option,"" Scathach confirmed. ""We believed Tab would not be foolish enough to attack the Pixen Technocracy.""

""We were wrong,"" said the Emperor.

""And that's why the Peacekeepers are pissed,"" said Mims.

""One week ago,"" Kilroy spoke up, ""Vrrl forces jumped into Empty Night Sector."" His eyes glowed red. ""They attacked Warmaster Skrell Scathach's fleet. They also launched Cascade Annihilators at our stations. Four stations were destroyed. Twelve million, six hundred thirty two thousand, eight hundred and five pixens died, along with thirty six thousand and four Peacekeeper units."" His eyes flashed brighter. ""They also destroyed the monument.""

""The monument?"" Yvian asked.

""The monument to you,"" Kilroy explained. ""The other units believed we were dead. They were completing a monument in Empty Night Sector. A statue of all of us, built out of the smelted remains of enemies we had defeated. It was hit with a Cascade Annihilator, atomizing the monument and the twenty six thousand Peacekeeper units that were building it.""

""The Peacekeepers helped us fight,"" Tybert continued. ""They massacred half of Tab's fleets before they could escape. Then they followed them into Vrrl space. They've been going from sector to sector, destroying every ship and station they could reach. They were in the process of depopulating Starfang Prime when you returned.""

""We tried to stop them,"" said Scathach. ""They threatened total genocide if we interfered. Exodus convinced me that we should wait, but after he disappeared..."" The Warmaster chuffed. ""I was about to send half my Hunters away to preserve the species, and attack with the rest.""

""We would have killed every one of you,"" Kilroy informed him.

""I know,"" Scathach agreed, ""but I didn't see much choice.""

""It would have been stupid,"" Kilroy argued. ""The Creator ordered us to attempt to preserve your species. We would have been satisfied with killing all meatbags in Vrrl space. Attacking us would have resulted in a war of extinction that even The Creator could not have stopped.""

""I know,"" Scathach repeated. ""I didn't see much choice. Could you have stood by and watched eighty percent of your people be slaughtered?""

""Negative,"" Kilroy admitted. His eyes flashed purple, then back to red. ""It would still have been stupid.""

""And that brings us to today,"" Tybert said. ""Most of Tab's forces are dead, along with billions of my people. Our Hunters in Empty Night Sector are afraid and on the verge of starvation.""

""We brought what food production we could,"" said Warmaster Scathach, ""but it's not nearly enough. The Peacekeepers couldn't do much to help. They're having a hard time keeping the pixens fed as it is.""

""So there we were,"" Tybert continued, ""in our darkest hour. And you returned at the final moment like heroes from a storybook. Seeing your ship made me feel how Aragon must have felt, when Gandalf arrived at Helm's Deep.""

""Gandalf?"" Yvian frowned.

""An ancient human tale,"" Tybert explained. He raised two eyebrows at Mims. ""You didn't introduce her to Tolkien?""

The human shrugged. ""She's not much for classical literature.""

""I am too,"" Yvian objected. ""I liked Star Wars.""

The human ignored that. ""We've got Tolkien on the ship's computer,"" he said. ""I'll send a copy to your wrist console. I think you'll like it.""

""Does it have lightsabers?"" Yvian asked. The human sighed.

""What matters is you're here and you stopped the Peacekeepers,"" Scathach changed the subject. ""Now we need to decide what to do next.""

""Isn't that obvious?"" asked the human. ""We're going to take your Empire back.""

""No,"" said Tybert. Everyone turned to look at him. He stood, placing his hands behind his back. ""We'll kill Tab and Sithis and reclaim our territory, but I already told you the Empire is dead. We need to decide what we're going to build from the ashes.""",17,1740466731.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Personally, I find a deeper taste and body with French Press. 

This morning, I brewed a light roast anaerobic Thai coffee from the Chiang Rai area with my French Press. Normally, I brew this with pourover gear. I noticed the deep fermented chocolate taste that permeates the flavor along with a lesser touch of the fruit I usually get with pourover. Smooth, chewy, no sourness or acidity, and quite satisfying. My pourovers usually feature the fruit, then the deeper flavors like chocolate, caramel, etc. But the Press brings out the depth of the coffee that pourovers usually do not. After all, we are drinking coffee, and not fruit juice or tea. You can say 'drink what you like', and of course, I will, but I find the Press hard to beat for it fullness.

When sellers cup to get a feel of the beans they will buy, the cupping technique is close to the Press technique, not the pourover's. Is this also a sign that the French Press may be the best choice for many coffees not machine made?",1,1740466497.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

One of the major drivers of the global Wi-Fi chipset market is the expanding adoption of Wi-Fi in businesses and enterprises. The Wi-Fi-based business models are getting more popular across all the business and enterprise sizes such as multinational banks to small start-up companies, and all segments of the application. To increase customer relationship management and customer engagement, Wi-Fi hotspots at hotels, buses, airports, trains, coffee shops retail stores, sports stadiums are increasingly being used, for instance Tesco has started to offer Wi-Fi hotspots in their stores to make the customer self-checkout easier through their smartphone app. Among the customers, the commercial spaces that offer free Wi-Fi are gaining more popularity which is expected to create more demand for Wi-Fi technology and fuel the growth of the global Wi-Fi chipset market.¬†

The COVID-19 pandemic has hindered the growth of the global Wi-Fi chipset market. In 2020, as the virus started spreading at a rapid rate, governments across the nations-imposed country-wide lockdowns. Due to the lockdowns manufacturing facilities were shut down completely for a long period and the restrictions on the trade stopped the international supply chain due to a ban on international trade. Thus, these circumstances declined the overall growth of the global Wi-Fi chipset market. But after the relaxation of the restrictions and economies started to reopen, the industry had to adapt to the circumstances, by providing their employees work from home and resuming the manufacturing process with less labour force. Therefore, the global Wi-Fi chipset is expected to make a rapid recovery.¬†

At Princeton, there are eating co-ops that have a lot of benefits, including being the most economical option (no paying for dining staff, bulk order deals, co-operation with other co-operatives, etc). It amounts to $1,000 to $1,500 per academic year and cooking once a week for this, compared to like $1,800 to $2,500 for independent and cooking every day 2-3x, and $9,000-$12,000 for dining hall or eating clubs (effectively frat houses). Is there something like this at UMass Amherst? What is generally considered the cheapest option that isn't starvation?

Additionally, is it generally better to be in campus or independent housing? Is there a strategy to getting the housemates you want for university housing, or is it open? What is most common for graduate students?

1ixonyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ixonyg/the_road_to_the_mountaintop/,The Road to The Mountaintop,"Before starting this story, I just want to say that I wrote this with Wendigoon in mind. I think he'll particularly like it. 

  
There's something about being on the open road that just seems to exemplify the concept of freedom itself. When you're riding down an endless stretch of highway with nothing but your thoughts to keep you company, you feel like you can really think. It's not like the rare quiet moments you get in everyday life, it's more prolonged and profound. Maybe that's why I decided to get in my car and drive three days ago.

I had been going down the highway for a long time, only stopping for gas and bathroom breaks, when I finally decided food was necessary as well. It was the dead of night, so there weren't many options, but I finally found a Waffle House sitting conveniently next to the highway. I headed in, being greeted by warm air and the smell of coffee.

I sat down and waited for the waitress to come over and acknowledge me. She was in her thirties, I think, with long brown hair and a bright smile that cut across the room. She flashed that smile in my direction to let me know she was on her way as she finished up with the elderly couple she was helping. It wasn't long before she was handing me a menu that I didn't need to see.

‚ÄúHey there, honey. What are you having?‚Äù she asked me, each word seeming to drip sweetness.

‚ÄúUh, coffee, please,‚Äù I muttered.

I've never been a very social person and when it comes to the art of conversation, I'm not much of a aficionado. Still, she either didn't notice or was too polite to let on that she did.

‚ÄúThat's no problem, I'll have it out in just a moment. So where you headed?‚Äù she said while retrieving a cup and a pot of coffee from the counter.

‚ÄúI'm just headed out west for now,‚Äù I replied, not knowing quite how to answer that question.

‚ÄúI thought you were going to say you were headed out to the Mountain Top,‚Äù she laughed.

‚ÄúThere's a mountain out this way?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not a real mountain, that's just the name of place. They call it The Mountain Top because people go there to talk to God.‚Äù

She poured a cup of coffee and I took a long sip before continuing.

‚ÄúThey go there to talk to God?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething like that. I've never been, myself, but people are headed up there all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds kind of... crazy, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. But people head up there all the time anyways.‚Äù

I looked over at the elderly couple sitting on the other side of the diner.

‚ÄúWhat about them? Are they headed to The Mountain Top?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Like I said, every headed down this road is usually going there. You might be one of the first people I've ever seen that isn't,‚Äù she said, her big smile starting to unnerve me a little.

‚ÄúWell, I've never even heard of the place,‚Äù I told her, taking another drink of the coffee.

‚ÄúYou have now, sugar. The Mountain Top is just about a day's ride out further west. You'll probably pass it. Lord knows you can't miss all the signs they have pointing it out.‚Äù

I shrugged and fell into the silence I had become so accustomed to as of late. Talking felt like it took more energy than it used to, and I wanted to save every bit of it for the road ahead.

I thought that would be the end of it, but she said one more thing to me when I went to pay the check.

‚ÄúThanks for dropping in. You should go to The Mountain Top. I think it's where you need to be right now.‚Äù

I didn't respond, just gave a shy smile and walked out to my car. The way she had insisted didn't sit right with me. I was more determined than ever to drive right past that place and hoped this would be the last I heard of it.

If only it had been that easy.

I got back in my car and flicked on the radio, hoping something other than droning of my engine and tires would aid in keeping me awake and alert. There wasn't much out here in the way of radio stations, mostly gospel music and a classical station. However, there was one that came through clear of a man who spoke in a low but kindly voice.

‚ÄúHey there, all you weary travelers. I'll be taking calls for the next few minutes to answer any questions you may have. Go ahead caller, you're on the air.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù came the elderly voice of a woman.

‚ÄúYes mam, go ahead with your question.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I'm headed to The Mountain Top right now and just wanted to know if I needed to bring anything along.‚Äù

The radio DJ laughed a little.

‚ÄúNo, all you need is your questions. Questions and a little bit of faith. Go ahead, next caller, you're on.‚Äù

The next voice was a young woman.

‚ÄúHi, Nate! I was just wondering about the trials, what happens if we fail?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, we all fail. The only trial that really matters is how determined you are to keep trying. Let's take one more. You're on with Nate, go ahead.‚Äù

This last one was a man's voice. He sounded tired.

‚ÄúYea, what would you say to a doubter? Like, someone who doesn't want to go to The Mountaintop even though it's calling them?‚Äù

Nate sighed heavily through the microphone.

‚ÄúIf they're called, it doesn't matter. They'll end up there one way or another. Okay, that's enough questions for now. Before we go to some music, we have a special message for Moses Pearson.‚Äù

I almost slammed on the brakes when I heard my name being spoken over the radio.

‚ÄúMoses, I know you're listening right now. You need to know that The Mountaintop is calling you. The next few days are going to be pretty intense for you. You got to let go and go with it. You're not meant to get to the place you're going. You're meant to get to The Mountaintop. Happy trails, friend.‚Äù

Maybe it was meant for someone else with my same name. There was probably a perfectly reasonable explanation for it, like the waitress calling up the radio after seeing me in the Waffle House. No, that couldn't be it, I'd never told her my name. Regardless, I was certain this was all some kind of trick, an elaborate hoax to play on unsuspecting tourists. Either way, I wasn't going to The Mountaintop.

I kept driving for quite a while after that, maybe two or three hours. My eyes were getting heavy and fatigue was starting to set in. I knew I'd have to pull over to sleep soon, whether I wanted to keep going or not. Thankfully, I saw a sign for a motel rearing over the highway in the distance.

‚ÄúThe Midian Inn, exit in four miles.‚Äù

I had been anticipating sleeping in my car that evening, so I was pretty relieved to see another option all the way out here. I pulled off the highway when I reached the exit and drove up the only building for miles around.

There was a sign with the words ‚ÄúMidian Inn‚Äù standing next to the little drive way up to the office area. I parked and approached, spying an old man sitting behind a pane of glass at the front area. He had been reading a book as I approached, but put it down when he saw me.

‚ÄúGood evening, mister,‚Äù he greeted me once I was within earshot. ‚ÄúI take it you'll be wanting a room?‚Äù

‚ÄúYea, I just need one bed. It's just me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can do that.‚Äù

I paid the man and he handed me a key with a tag attached that displayed the room number: 215.

‚ÄúOkay, check out is at eleven in the morning tomorrow. Make sure to get something to eat when you wake up, it'll be your last chance before doing the first trial.‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst trial?‚Äù I asked, getting a sinking feeling in my stomach as he smiled.

‚ÄúThe first trial of The Mountaintop. That's where you're headed, isn't it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo... I'm just passing through,‚Äù I said, swallowing my irritation.

‚ÄúMy apologies, mister. Where are you headed, if you're not going there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm headed to Corpus Christi, in Texas. For some reason, my GPS picked this route, so this is the way I'm headed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's awful strange, but the highway will lead there eventually, if that's where you want to go.‚Äù

I was about to turn to walk away, but stopped and asked the question I had been trying to push down the whole time.

‚ÄúWhat is The Mountaintop anyways?‚Äù

‚ÄúDepends on who you ask. Some people think they can go there to talk to God, others think that it's a pilgrimage site or something. Over the years, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's different things to different people at different times.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you've never been?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I've been a few times, but it was different each time. The first time I went, it was just a section of forest with nothing there but a hot spring. The second time, it was a some kind of church. The last time I went there was to scatter my wife's ashes. It was a graveyard that time. I don't know if they change location every so often or something. The road leading up to it has so many twists and turns that it's hard to remember if it's in the same place or not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I'm not headed that way. I'm just trying to get to Corpus Christi. Still, it does sound interesting.‚Äù

The old man smiled and went back to his book, giving me the cue to head to my room. I opened the door and looked around at the hotel room which seemed to have been a snapshot of the early eighties. The d√©cor was dated and the carpet was shaggy, making me feel a little nostalgic as I kicked off my shoes and settled into the bed. I knew sleep would come pretty quickly, so I didn't bother taking a shower. I'd save that for the morning.

That night, I dreamed about my wife. In my dream, she was sitting next to the bed, leaning over me and brushing my hair out of my face. She didn't say anything, just smiled at me reassuringly. She leaned in and kissed my forehead just as I woke up.

I took a shower and got dressed. I was anxious to be back on the road and didn't want to waste any time, so I immediately went to go check out. I walked to the little office area and was surprised to see the same old man that I had checked in with last night. I figured it would have been someone else in the morning, but he was smiling at me as I approached.

‚ÄúSleep well?‚Äù he asked as I slid him back the key.

‚ÄúYea, I think I'm ready to get back on the road now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still think you're going to Corpus Christi?‚Äù he asked, making me feel a little uneasy.

‚ÄúYea, that's still my destination,‚Äù I answered with a nervous laugh.

‚ÄúYea, Jonah thought he was going to go somewhere too. That was before the whale got him,‚Äù the old man responded with a smile.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI mean, you have a good trip, Moses.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know my name?‚Äù I responded, anger creeping into my voice.

‚ÄúYou've been called,‚Äù was the only thing he said, before looking down to his book, which I could see was a copy of Moby Dick.

I probably should have asked more questions in that moment, but instead, I walked away. I was anxious to get away from this place quickly, unable to shake the feeling that I was in some kind of danger. The sooner I saw The Mountaintop disappearing into my rear view, the better.

As the Midian Inn disappeared behind me, I thought about how the old man had learned my name and decided he probably saw my ID in my wallet when I went to pay him last night. Another happenstance that can be completely explained a way with rationality. It's such a shame that I didn't accept that. The whole thing just felt off, like some massive cult was documenting my movements and keeping tabs on me. Either way, it was nothing distance couldn't solve, so I set myself to putting as much distance between myself and all this as I could.

The minutes crept by as the sound of my tires spinning on the road became the only thing I could hear. I had been struggling with the urge to turn on my radio again, simultaneously worried that I'd hear the DJ speaking to me again and curious of what this was all really about. Eventually, I gave in to curiosity and turned the dial.

‚ÄúThis is Nate saying good morning to all you listeners from The Moutaintop! We're going to take some calls before going back to the music. Caller, you're on the air with Nate.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, Nate!‚Äù came a young lady's voice, bubbly and full of excitement. ‚ÄúI just wanted to say that I just left the Mountaintop and it was amazing! What happens if someone is called there and doesn't go?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood question, mam. It doesn't matter if someone wants to go or not when they're called, they'll end up there one way or another. The Mountaintop isn't something you can just ignore, after all. Next caller, you're on!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Nate, what is the Mountaintop anyways?‚Äù came the voice of a young man.

‚ÄúThe Mountaintop is something that's hard to explain, but I'll do my best. It's where God touches creation. We're all sinners and we're all lost, but He guides us back to the path, and The Mountaintop is like the part of a compass that faces north. Next caller, go ahead!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Nate, I just wanted to send a shout out to Moses! He's on his way to The Mountaintop right now, even though I think he's going to try to run. Do you think you can give him some words of encouragement?‚Äù

I recognized that voice. It was the old man from the inn.

‚ÄúMoses, I know you're listening. You're headed down the highway right now, probably scared and confused. All the answers you need are waiting for you at The Mountaintop. Be not afraid. You know who said that? Gabriel, when he told Mary Jesus was on His way. He told that to Joseph when he feared to take Mary for his wife. He said it to Paul when he feared he'd be shipwrecked. Well, Moses, keep your eyes and ears open, because Gabriel is going to say it to you. Be not afraid.‚Äù

As if on cue, I saw a large billboard rising over the road, a plain white rectangle with large black words printed across it.

‚ÄúBe not afraid.‚Äù

I slammed down on the gas, my heart racing. Despite the commandment of the billboard, I don't think I've ever been more terrified in my life.

I sped along, the radio switching for speech to the sounds of smooth jazz. I didn't have an explanation for what was happening, and I didn't try to rationalize it anymore. I just knew I wanted to run as fast as I could to get the hell out here.

It was another hour or two down the road that I saw the large sign telling me that the next exit would lead me to the first trial of The Mountaintop. For some reason, I just knew that if I blew past that exit, I'd be home free. So I pressed down on the accelerator, my car jumping forward as it gained speed. I glanced at the speedometer and saw I was going over a hundred miles an hour. The exit blurred past me and I grinned. I finally felt like I had escaped. That's when I saw something on the road up ahead and slammed on my brakes.

Too late.

I managed to slow my car down, but I still smashed into the thing going about forty miles an hour. It was a miracle I wasn't injured, but my car wasn't so lucky. I climbed out and looked at the front and saw both the front tires has burst and been shredded by the plastic of whatever it was I crashed into. It was something big, a large plastic thing laying in the middle of the highway. I walked around to get a better look at it and almost fainted when I finally realized what I was laying my eyes on.

It was a giant plastic figurine of a whale.

I climbed back into my car and cranked it, momentarily determined to drive it on the shredded tires all the way to the next exit, but it sputtered and didn't turn over. I cursed and climbed back out, pulling out my cellphone and noticing I didn't have any signal in the area. So calling a towtruck wasn't going to work.

I started walking forward eventually, deciding I'd get to the next exit and call from there. The sun beat down from overhead, drawing beads of precious moisture from my brow and burning my skin. It was a hard journey, but I was determined to get to the next exit and stay away from The Mountaintop.

I'd walked for three hours, the sun arcing along and assaulting me every step of the way. As I saw an exit looming in the distance, however, I felt renewed vigor and picked up my pace. That pace slowed to a halt when I saw the sign over the exit.

‚ÄúThe Mountaintop, first trial.‚Äù

I didn't understand how it could have been possible, but I was looking at the same exit I had just driven past earlier. If I strained my eyes, I could even make out my car still smashed halfway into the plastic whale in the distance. I thought about triying to walk away again, but thirst won out over my desire to flee. I started walking towards The Mountaintop.

The exit led to a neat little parking lot devoid of cars. I remember getting nervous that there would be no one there, but still took the little dirt road leading into the wooded area ahead. I was thankful for the trees blocking the unforgiving sun as I walked along, giving some respite to my sunburned skin and sweat drenched body. After walking for a few minutes, I spotted a small, squat wooden building ahead. It looked almost like a cross between a log cabin and a convenience store. I arrived at the entrance and pulled open the door, breathing a sigh of relief as I was greeted by the cold air. I had half expected it to be locked.

Inside was even more like a convenience store, with coolers housing drinks and aisles of various goods. However, none of them were familiar to me. There were bags of what I thought were chips labeled ‚ÄúManna‚Äù and bottles of water with brand name ‚ÄúSiloam.‚Äù It was all very strange, as was the young black lady behind the counter.

‚ÄúCongratulations on making it through the first trial!‚Äù she greeted me.

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù I asked, grabbing a bottle of the water and bringing it to the counter.

‚ÄúYou made it through the desert. That's the first trial,‚Äù she explained.

I didn't respond, feeling too tired, and pulled out my wallet to pay for the water.

‚ÄúOh, you don't need to pay. That's yours,‚Äù she said, pushing the bottle towards me.

I looked at her warily, but unscrewed the lid and drank most of it in several greedy gulps. I've never heard of Siloam Water, but I think it was the sweetest water I've ever tasted in my life.

‚ÄúYou ready for the second trial?‚Äù she asked, smiling kindly at me.

‚ÄúActually, I just need to use your phone and the number for a towing company,‚Äù I shot back with an irritated look.

‚ÄúFor your car down the road? It's already been picked up and is getting repaired. It will be back here when you're done. That'll be after you reach The Mountaintop though.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm not going.‚Äù

‚ÄúSugar, you don't have a choice. You've been called.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen here, you crazy bitch, I'm not going to your stupid clubhouse or whatever it is!‚Äù

She looked completely unfazed by my outburst, which in turn, made me feel downright terrified.

‚ÄúLook at you, Moses, so quick to get back on that road. Where you headed anyways? What's at the end of that road for you? You think your wife is waiting for you down in Corpus Christi?‚Äù

Her voice was kind and dripping with a tone of sympathy, but her words only served to anger me. Yet, even more than anger, they scared me.

‚ÄúShut up...‚Äù was all I can manage to say.

‚ÄúGet yourself on up the road to the second trial. I'm sure they have a phone you can use.‚Äù

I started to turn to head out the door, when she whistled to get my attention and I turned back, just in time to catch another bottle of water she tossed at me.

‚ÄúAnd while you're at it Moses, maybe watch your mouth?‚Äù

I didn't respond and stormed back out the door. The path stretched further along going a little uphill. I downed the rest of the first bottle and threw it on the ground. It seemed ridiculous, but if littering was the best revenge I could muster in this moment, then I'd take it.

I started walking up the hill, looking for the next building or whatever the hell it was. As I walked, I felt my fear and anger ebb away, being too exhausted from everything happening to maintain such heightened emotions. Instead, I allowed myself to sink into a comfortable misery. The wooded area pressed in from all sides, and as I walked, I spotted what looked like a noose hanging from a tree. Then another. Soon, I was wading through a sea of them.

I should of felt afraid by such threatening imagery, but instead, I felt... sadness. More sadness than I could possibly put into words. Towards the end of the path was a ladder heading up a tree to one of the nooses, and I thought hard about climbing it. I walked up and rested a hand against the wooden plank nailed there and closed my eyes.

‚ÄúFeeling lost, stranger?‚Äù

I jumped and looked behind me to see an man with a thick beard looking at me with an amused expression.

‚ÄúUh, yea, I'm looking for a phone.‚Äù

The man laughed, a cheerful juxtaposition in the midst of the nooses.

‚ÄúOh Lord! I don't think you'll find a phone up there!‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I just want to get out of here.‚Äù

His tone changed from mirth to a hardened seriousness as he eyed me, looking me fully up and down in a way that made me want to squirm.

‚ÄúNo, you want peace.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to protest, but found myself unable to speak.

‚ÄúYou want peace and you won't find that up there either,‚Äù he said with a wary glance towards the top of the ladder.

‚ÄúWhere would I find it then?‚Äù I asked, tears welling in my eyes.

‚ÄúYou already know. You just need to quit running from it.‚Äù

I closed my eyes, feeling the tears roll down my cheeks as I sucked in a labored breath.

‚ÄúI just need to go. I need to get back on the road.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're on it, stranger. You just have to keep walking it.‚Äù

I felt a sudden rush of anger and rounded on him to scream. I wanted to scream that he was a moron. I wanted to hit him with all my strength. I wanted to release all the frustration boiling inside me in that moment, but when I opened my eyes and spun around, he was gone.

I looked around, wondering where he had disappeared to, but there was no one there. I did see a path leading deeper into the woods though, and decided to take that.

I walked along, leaving the rope laden trees behind me and pushed forward. I walked for a long time, eventually seeing the trees thin away as I breached a clearing, then almost fell to my knees.

There, in the middle of the clearing, as a hospital bed. I recognized it immediately, having spent enough time beside one. I approached it and collapsed to my knees, burying my face into the linen sheets and stifling a sob.

‚ÄúYou miss her.‚Äù

I didn't look up, just froze there. The sheets even smelled like her. I felt a hand touch my shoulder, gently resting there as the female voice continued.

‚ÄúWhat do you think she'd say if she knew where you were going.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe can't say anything,‚Äù I responded, lifting my head up a little. ‚ÄúShe's dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not what I asked you, Moses. Stop running from the answer.‚Äù

Maybe it was the motherly way she spoke to me, but I just couldn't rouse myself into the anger I had felt earlier. Instead, I answered her question.

‚ÄúShe'd say I was being a fool. That I was being selfish.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Moses. She'd say that you are loved. And you are.‚Äù

I looked up then, seeing a middle aged woman with a face full of mercy. She smiled at me and brushed my hair back the same way my wife used to.

‚ÄúShe'd say she misses you. She'd say you are strong enough to keep going, even if you don't believe it. Most importantly, she'd say she loves you and always will.‚Äù

I cried, tears rolling down my cheeks, then buried my head into the sheets that smelled of her again.

‚ÄúI'm sorry...‚Äù I muttered, but when I looked up, the woman was gone. The sun was setting and there was a trail across the clearing that I knew I had to walk. So I got up, my heart still aching, and walked towards it.

I didn't have far to walk. Just a little bit ahead was the top of the hill, stones paving the summit in a neat circle. An old fashioned well stood atop the center, which I approached cautiously. For some reason, the well filled me with a deep sense of foreboding. I was a few feet away from it when a new voice called out to me.

‚ÄúDon't get too close to it, Moses.‚Äù

I turned to see a young man with long hair standing there. He must have been in his mid twenties, his face calm and serene as he strode towards me.

‚ÄúYou know, this well usually isn't here. It's usually in a small town on a midwestern farm, tormenting a family that grows corn there. It's a long story.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù I asked, exhausted.

‚ÄúBecause I called you, Moses,‚Äù the young man said, pulling a piece of meat from his pocket and tossing it into the well. ‚ÄúWe all face monsters in our lives. Some of those monsters are like this well, something tangible and providing an exterior threat. Most of us will never have to deal with anything like that. Most of us will have to battle interior threats, which are far more dangerous. Why are you going to Corpus Christi?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you are who I think you are, then you already know,‚Äù I answered, hearing my anger creeping into my voice.

‚ÄúIt doesn't work that way. You need to say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Why?! So you can chastise me? So you can talk me out of it? So you can use my dead wife as a talking point to change my mind?!‚Äù I screamed, my anger finally boiling over.

‚ÄúNo, Moses. So you can hear how horrible it really is.‚Äù

I said nothing. I stared at him in fury, as if he were the avatar of all my problems made manifest. Finally, he spoke to me again.

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù

Finally, I broke.

‚ÄúI wanted to see the ocean.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Moses. Say it. Say it!‚Äù he shouted the last two words, making me jump.

‚ÄúI wanted to kill myself. I wanted to swim out into the sea until I couldn't make it back to shore and let the waves take me under.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would you want that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I could be with her again. I want to die in the place where I met her. It seemed... fitting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou thought it would be fitting to taint the single most important place of your relationship with her?‚Äù

I didn't have an answer for that. I didn't want to admit it, but in that moment, I could hear how horrible it sounded.

‚ÄúI'm sorry...‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúWhy are you sorry?‚Äù he asked, making me look at the ground in shame.

‚ÄúI'm... I'm sorry that I wasn't stronger. I'm sorry that I wanted to give up.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's not me you should apologize to. Right now your son is at home with your mother. What do you think he'd do if he lost both his parents, one right after the other?‚Äù

The shame burned my eyes, eliciting fresh tears as I fell to my knees.

‚ÄúDo you understand why I called you here now? It was never about you, Moses. It was about him, your son. He prayed for you. He prayed to see his father again.‚Äù

I felt my breath catch in my throat as the young man touched my elbow to get my attention.

‚ÄúShe loves you. He loves you. You are loved. You're about a day's drive from Corpus Christi. When you get there, you know what you should do and what you shouldn't. Do the right thing.‚Äù

I looked up at him, feeling all my anger and fear and sadness evaporate as he gazed at me with a serene expression of what I can only describe as forgiveness.

‚ÄúWhat's the right thing to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already know, Moses,‚Äù he whispered, pulling me into an embrace. ‚ÄúGo there and do the right thing.‚Äù

I left soon after that, walking my way back down the hill. The hospital bed and the nooses were both gone, but the little convenience store thing was there. I walked inside and saw the same woman as before standing behind the counter. She smiled at me as I entered.

‚ÄúDid you find what you were looking for?‚Äù she said with a sly grin.

‚ÄúThere's no phone up there...‚Äù I said dumbly.

‚ÄúNo, but there was a call waiting for you. I hope you listened.‚Äù

I nodded walked back out, not knowing what to say. As I stepped out, I saw the empty bottle of water I had tossed on the ground still laying there. I picked it up and threw it away in the little trashcan outside the shop and went on my way.

I saw my car sitting in the parking area as I approached, the only there. It looked as if it had never been damaged at all. I got in and turned the key, seeing that it had been filled with gas as well. Sitting on the passenger seat was an envelope that I opened, pulling out the handwritten note within.

‚ÄúYour road takes you to the ocean, but it doesn't end there. Unlike the last Moses I met at The Mountaintop, you will see the promised land.‚Äù

I drove down to Corpus Christi, traveling through the small Texas towns and admiring the scenery. Oil rigs and rolling pastures lined the road on either side as the air became fresher. I took the turn headed into Corpus Christi and drove until I was parked beside a bay. There's a little gazebo-like structure there with a plaque about General Travis that overlooks the beach. I met my wife there a long time ago. I pulled the crisp air of the sea into my lungs and steeled myself as I opened the urn I had carried along with me. I kissed it, only hesitating for a moment, before turning it upside down and watching as the wind caught the ashes, pulling them out across the water. I stared for a long time, thinking of her face, memorizing every detail. Then, I turned and walked back to my car. I took another deep breath and started the journey back home to my son.

On the way back, I didn't see any signs pointing to The Mountaintop. That didn't surprise me. I had already answered the call. It would be somewhere else now, being what was needed for whoever needed it.

If you're ever riding down the highway and see signs for The Mountaintop, take notice. And if you turn on the radio and hear someone calling you by name to go, be not afraid.

1ixol02,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ixol02/biscoff_vodka_infusion/,Biscoff vodka infusion,"Hi guys! Quick question if any of you knowledgeable bar tenders could help me.

I want to infuse vodka with biscoff spread, I'm just concerned it will seperate again once left in the fridge, I've done some online searching and the closest thing I can find is someone here that did a biscoff butter fat wash. Any advice or anecdotes would be more than welcome.

To try and give something back while I'm here, whenever I make maceration syrups, I strain it through a 1000 micron brew bag from a brewery. Supposed to be for getting hops into beer brewing but they cost ten bucks (AUD), are re-usable, and they give you clean syrups with no particulate and a higher yield as you can twist the bag and squeeze a little extra out. A lot quicker than waiting for things to drip through coffee filters. I have also used this bag to strain a burnt butter washed tequila and it came out very nice.

Thanks for any help in advance!! This community has always given me some amazing responses.",5,1740464910.0,cocktails,5,1.0,False

The film fades in moving through a busy police station, the camera swings over the shoulder of a beat cop kneeling down in front of a young boy wearing a suit. The camera pans down to the boy‚Äôs hands as he restrings a pearl necklace, tears dripping down onto the necklace, one tear running down the cord. The officer puts his hand on the boy‚Äôs shoulder and in a soft voice says, ‚ÄúSon someone is here for you‚Äù. The camera follows the eyeline of the boy over the officer‚Äôs shoulder to a young Alfred in a gray suit and black over coat. The boy stops whimpering as the police officer steps to the side, the man in the suit kneeling down and meeting the boy‚Äôs eyeline. He smiles at the boy and in a soft British accent says, ‚ÄúI am so sorry Master Bruce, I should have been there to pick you up from the theatre‚Äù he sighs ‚ÄúBut I promise to never leave your side again, but please stay strong‚Ä¶ for them‚Äù. The camera then shows the young Bruce walking out of the police station with Alfred by his side.

The camera then pans up the building to show the title of ‚ÄúBatman: Nightmare‚Äù. Then the camera pans further up to show Batman standing on a gargoyle looking out at the city. A voice wrings out from behind Batman ‚ÄúEvening Batman‚Äù, Batman turns around and steps onto the roof. Batman looks at one of the two figures on the rooftop nodding to one ‚ÄúEvening Commissioner‚Äù. He then turns to the other figure ‚ÄúEvening Detective Bullock‚Äù. Harvey Bullock chuckles ‚ÄúYeah, and good morning to you to Zorro‚Äù, Jim pats Bullock on the shoulder ‚ÄúAt ease Bullock‚Äù. Jim sips a cup of coffee and takes a file from Bullock ‚ÄúBlack Mask‚Äôs crew are moving a shipment at the harbor tonight.‚Äù Batman looks Jim in the eye ‚ÄúDo we know who the supplier is?‚Äù Bullock interjects ‚ÄúNot yet spooky.‚Äù Batman groans and approaches the edge of the building looking over his shoulder ‚ÄúSee you at the docks‚Äù. Bruce then jumps down from the rooftop and lands in the driver‚Äôs seat of the Batmobile.

The Batmobile roars to life and drives away from GCPD HQ. The camera then cuts to the dock where thugs are moving wooden crates and pallets from shipping containers to an 18-wheeler truck. The camera pans to someone on one of the buildings by the dock being pulled back into the darkness. The thugs initially don‚Äôt notice, but soon one of them that are moving the crates is pulled up into the air. The thugs begin to shine flashlights all over in search of the bat, as they are picked off one by one. One thug yells out ‚ÄúShit I‚Äôm out of here‚Äù, He drops his gun and flashlight and tries to run but runs straight into batman‚Äôs chest. Batman looks down at the thug grabbing him by the shirt and growls ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Mask‚Äôs supplier?‚Äù The thug terrified belts out ‚ÄúI-I Can‚Äôt!!! They‚Äôll kill me if I say!!!‚Äù Batman‚Äôs grip tightens, ‚ÄúI asked for a name!‚Äù The thug knowing that Batman is scarier than any villain ‚ÄúThorne!!! Rupert Thorne!!!‚Äù

Batman drops him as police sirens begin to approach and Harvey Bullock approaches him, as the thugs are rounded up ‚ÄúBullock the supplier is Thorne!‚Äù Bullock looks at Batman and sighs ‚ÄúThe Commish wants to see you back at Arkham, there‚Äôs been a breakout.‚Äù The Camera cuts to a dark hallway in Arkham Asylum, Batman meeting Commissioner Gordon outside of a heavy steel door ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs escaped?‚Äù. Hugo Strange walks up ‚ÄúDr. Jonathan Crane, or who you know better as Scarecrow.‚Äù Hugo Strange says, ‚ÄúDr. Crane showed no sign of wanting to break out, he was actually recovering‚Äù Gordon interjects, ‚ÄúThe DA just approved Crane‚Äôs transfer to Blackgate‚Äôs supervillain wing. But then why breakout now, why wouldn‚Äôt he wait till he was being moved, or until he got to Blackgate.‚Äù

Robin cuts into the conversation, dropping down from the rafters seeming to appear from nowhere ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs quite simple Commissioner, Crane broke out now because security around him was at its weakest.‚Äù Batman looks down at his son ‚ÄúOr it‚Äôs because he managed to manipulate the staff into believing him and didn‚Äôt want to wait. Jonathan Crane was a psychiatrist in his previous life.‚Äù Hugo Strange then posits to himself ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù while stroking his beard, Strange then opened the heavy iron door gesturing into the cell ‚Äúthis is Dr. Crane‚Äôs cell, hopefully you can find a clue to his whereabouts.‚Äù Batman, Commissioner Gordon and Robin click on their flashlights and begin searching scarecrow‚Äôs cell. The smooth concrete walls are scratched with drawings of the scarecrow‚Äôs costume, and phrases such as ‚ÄúI must conquer fear‚Äù or ‚Äúmaster of fear.‚Äù

Batman shines the light at a back corner of the cell seeing something drawn along the back wall in what appears to be blood and scratches into the concrete. Gordon shudders at the sight of it, it is a drawing of Batman burning at the stake while and Scarecrow looms over Gotham. And over top of the mural it reads ‚ÄúTHE BAT MUST PAY!‚Äù Jim Gordon breaks the silence ‚ÄúOh God‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs hope he doesn‚Äôt intend to make this a reality. Our number one priority should be finding him.‚Äù Batman gets closer running his fingers along the wicked mural ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what we can shake loose, if Crane is out, he‚Äôll most likely reach out to his old contacts.‚Äù Robin smiles while looking at the mural with a morbid fascination but Batman cocks his head as if to say that they were leaving. The dynamic duo quickly leaves the cell walking toward the exit, Jim Gordon follows after them and turns to Hugo Strange. Strange then posits ‚Äúwhat an interesting specimen, do you think you could arrange a time for me to have a one on one with him, Commissioner.‚Äù Commissioner Gordon quickly snaps back in a sarcastic tone ‚ÄúBecome a supervillain, with some sort of schtick, like puzzles, steroids, or fear, then I won‚Äôt have to arrange anything.‚Äù

The scene then cuts to a dimly lit alleyway, a single man walks out of a utility door out into the alley. He has a drink in one hand and a paper bag with the bat burger logo in the other, a duffle bag slung over his shoulder. The man takes a sip from his cup, when he is suddenly flipped upside down, his food dropping to the ground and drink spilling everywhere while the duffle bag drops with a thud. Batman steps out from the shadows as if he was part of them while Robin jumps down from a fire escape his sword glinting in the dim light. ‚ÄúAh what the hell man, is it illegal for a guy to get dinner?‚Äù Batman demands ‚ÄúReynolds, where‚Äôs Crane?‚Äù Then Reynolds yelps out ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know man! Last I heard he was still in Arkham; I haven‚Äôt heard from the guy in months.‚Äù Batman punches Reynolds across the face knocking out one of his teeth, ‚ÄúCrane broke out, and you were his supplier before he went away! Where is he?‚Äù Robin then puts his sword to Reynolds throat and looks at Bats ‚ÄúFather he isn‚Äôt giving us anything. Shall I make him talk‚Äù

Reynolds shudders staring wide eyed at Batman, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, where he went! I didn‚Äôt even know he broke out! I went clean after my stint in Blackgate! I promise!‚Äù Batman hits something on his belt and Reynolds drops to the ground with a thud Reynolds grunting in pain. Bats then kneels down so he was face to face with Reynolds, ‚ÄúDo you know where he might have had a stache of weapons or fear toxin?‚Äù Reynolds shakes his head frantically ‚ÄúNo I swear! But there‚Äôs a chick who used to run with Crane that last I heard she was working Security at the Iceberg Lounge!‚Äù Batman leans in closer grabbing Reynolds by the collar ‚ÄúI need a name!‚Äù Reynolds stammers out ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her name, but Crane nicknamed her Blackbird. That‚Äôs all I know I swear!‚Äù Robin walks over lowering his sword looking over at Batman ‚ÄúFather, I believe that he‚Äôs telling the truth.‚Äù Batman stands up looking down at Reynolds ‚ÄúKeep your nose clean Reynolds.‚Äù Batman then steps over Reynolds and walks out of the alley with Robin by his side. Batman looks down at Damien ‚ÄúWhat have I told you about bringing your sword into the field?‚Äù Damien just scoffs ‚ÄúJason put it in the Batmobile last time he visited‚Äù Batman chuckles as they get into the Batmobile which speeds off. The camera is in overhead long take following the Batmobile as it drives through the streets of Gotham. While the Batmobile drives Bruce calls Alfred at the Batcave. ‚ÄúAlfred it‚Äôs going to be a late night tonight.‚Äù Alfred sighs deeply ‚ÄúWho broke out of Arkham this time master Bruce?‚Äù Damien cuts in ‚ÄúScarecrow broke out.‚Äù Alfred clicks his tongue ‚ÄúGood thing I packed dinner for you two, just check the glove box.‚Äù Batman smiles ‚ÄúThank you Alfred.‚Äù

The Batmobile then suddenly stops and the camera pans up to show that the Batmobile has parked outside of the of Iceberg Lounge. The camera then cuts to inside of the Iceberg Lounge that shows the levels of the club and the terrain of the scene. There are flashing red and purple lights with loud blaring dance music all over while people dance like in any other night club. The camera then pans into an office overlooking the partying that‚Äôs taking place. There‚Äôs a conversation between Penguin and Two-Face taking place in the office about business, but then there is a sudden heavy knock on the door. The Penguin looks over at it and calls out ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù A goon then responds ‚ÄúThe Bat is here, he‚Äôs asking about someone‚Ä¶‚Äù Two-Face interjects ‚ÄúLet him in.‚Äù Batman and Robin are let into the office and close the door behind them Damien snacking on a sandwich. Batman says ‚ÄúEvening Oswald, Evening Harvey, don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not here to be a party crasher, I just need some information.
