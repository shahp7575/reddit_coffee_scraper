New York City has an undeniable charm, no matter the weather. While sunny days might draw crowds to its parks and rooftops, there‚Äôs something magical about experiencing Manhattan on a rainy day. The streets glisten, the city slows down (just a little), and every corner feels cinematic. This is especially true in Chelsea, one of NYC‚Äôs most dynamic neighborhoods. Join me on a journey through this iconic area ‚Äî a walking tour that uncovers the beauty, energy, and surprises of New York, rain and all.

https://preview.redd.it/hjfh8g8v8d2e1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9f8cec954817ecb379d87db7151384cc13ae820

The Start: Chelsea Market

Our journey begins at¬†Chelsea Market, a historic space that perfectly blends old-world charm with modern NYC vibes. Located in the heart of Manhattan‚Äôs Chelsea neighborhood, this former Nabisco factory has become a foodie paradise.

Walking into the market on a rainy day feels like stepping into a warm, bustling cocoon. The sounds of sizzling food, clinking glasses, and soft chatter echo through its industrial-chic halls. Vendors offer everything from artisanal pastries to fresh seafood ‚Äî it‚Äôs a sensory overload in the best way.

A Coffee Lover‚Äôs Dream: Starbucks Reserve Roastery

Just a short walk away, I arrive at the¬†Starbucks Reserve Roastery¬†‚Äî a must-visit destination for coffee enthusiasts. This isn‚Äôt your average Starbucks; it‚Äôs an immersive coffee experience.

The Meatpacking District: Grit Meets Glamour

Leaving the Roastery, I head into the¬†Meatpacking District, a neighborhood that embodies the perfect mix of grit and glamour. The cobblestone streets glisten in the rain, reflecting the glow of streetlights and boutique storefronts.

This area, once home to meatpacking plants, has transformed into a vibrant hub of high-end fashion, art galleries, and trendy restaurants. Even in the rain, the energy is palpable. Locals and tourists alike wander the streets, umbrellas in hand, as if the weather is just another accessory to their NYC experience.

The final stop on this rainy day adventure is the incredible¬†Little Island, a man-made park that seems to float above the Hudson River.

https://preview.redd.it/jyhitkl09d2e1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cc6e7e8e9862fab707c4377192eddef04d0e016

As I walk across the bridge to this architectural marvel, I‚Äôm greeted by lush greenery, winding paths, and breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline ‚Äî even with the clouds hanging low. The rain adds a serene touch, making the park feel like an urban oasis.

Explore the vibrant streets of Chelsea on a rainy day, and you‚Äôll see why New York City truly is the city that never sleeps ‚Äî even when the clouds roll in.

Friend 1, A, is becoming obsessed with weed. It's college, that stuff is everywhere, but she's CONSTANTLY high. Now, I know I can't say anything, cuz live your life I can't tell you what to do, but it's getting obsessive. She's had everyone else try it and the others do it occasionally but she's going crazy with it. She's the most chill and not really a problem. The problem is that she influenced Friend 2, G, into buying drugs. They were talking about it at lunch and G wanted to buy a vape. I went off, saying that nicotine is bad. G is also autistic and I can tell he's doing it to fit in. He got mad at me and said that it's his money but I don't want to be around someone that vapes. Different topic, Friend 3, J, is obsessed with finding a boyfriend. Shes on every dating app ever and is talking to a guy, V, who she really likes and has been talking to for 6 weeks but she wants him now and he's still in highschool so it's not working. He's dedicated to her but neither of them have a car and he's 30 mins away. She just hooked up with this OTHER GUY while V and her are ""not dating"" but still calling each other ""baby""???? I told her she made a bad decision and she got mad but we're chill now. My friends are making bad decisions and turning into people I don't want to hang out with. Here's the big problem, I don't know how to make friends. I've tried. I don't get it and it never works out. 

TLDR: one friend, A, is smoking weed and influenced another friend, G, into buying a vape. Friend J is ""cheating"" but not cheating on a boy with a different boy and I'm starting not to like their behavior but I don't know how to make friends. Help?

I got tired of trying things with no results so I decided to cut the most difficult of them all: caffeine. And it worked. Before that, I replaced coffee for matcha, then replaced matcha for green tea or for some energy drinks but they all caused reflux because of one thing: caffeine.
I just cut caffeine for 4 days, stopped PPI and I got absolutely no reflux symptoms.

I‚Äôm not a healthcare professionnal, so I don‚Äôt advise you to go off PPI without consulting your doctor first, but honestly, if you‚Äôre a caffeine consumer, you should try completely going off caffeine. Not just reducing it.

We live in Ontario, Canada, I am using Canadian dollars. I am at a limbs end here, I have spent countless hours researching now and I‚Äôm not finding answers to every question. I am nowhere near an expert, I have only been at the searching game for a couple days, but I believe I‚Äôve gotten a sound understanding of the difference in the bigger features every machine offers. I‚Äôve visited stores, seen demos, watched reviews, but none of my effort seems to have led anywhere.

The primary reason all of my suggestions were shut down come to bar pressure. I understand it comes to individuals preferences, that averaging at 9 is ideal for a wide variety of people, but I keep hearing quite insistently from my family‚Äôs one complainer that ‚Äúanything below 18 bar is water‚Äù and I‚Äôm rather upset by this- every machine I have found that promises as much flexibility, reliability, etc- works with (as advertised) 15 bar. This is the Breville Bambino plus, Breville Barista Express Impress, Rancilio Silvia pro x, and a handful of options that I did not get the chance to even get the name of as they advertise 9 as the default bar. I cannot express how adamant he is over the bar pressure, I am exhausted from hearing all of my suggestions shut down. I would love to have that particular idea explained to me, why some people like my one family member search for this higher pressure, especially how it would work with our preferred dark roast coffees. I want to get one machine that can keep up with all my family members‚Äô individual preferences.

Secondly, I am fairly confident that we will be moving forward with the Breville Bambino plus because of the cost and features it offers. If the bar pressure truly has anything to do with the quality of coffee that comes out, what alternatives are there that can cater to as many differences in my family members preferences?

‚Ä¶ Is there a machine (even if it‚Äôs of higher cost) that does not use plastic tubing but still offers the range in features and reliance I‚Äôm looking for? Im still okay with the Bambino pro, but.. I can‚Äôt find anything else.

I am also aware I have likely worded things in a weird way, I do not know much of the terminology and only loosely explained things that were hour long  conversations. I need someone who knows what‚Äôs up with these specific topics, hearing a few more options, opinions, and facts that fit our needs and can explain why we would need specific features would also be great.

No matter what time I go to bed - 9PM, 11PM, midnight - I'm up at 3AM like clockwork.

The weird part is I don't feel anxious or stressed when I wake up. I just... wake up. And then it takes me 1-2 hours to fall back asleep. By the time my alarm goes off at 7AM, I feel like I've barely slept. I'm starting to dread going to bed because I know what's coming.

During the day, I'm struggling to focus at my office job, I've started drinking way too much coffee, and my workout routine has gone downhill because I'm too exhausted to hit the gym. I've tried cutting out screens before bed, keeping the room cold, using a white noise machine, and even melatonin which just makes me groggy.

Does anyone else deal with this consistent middle-of-the-night waking? Could it be related to cortisol or blood sugar? I know I should probably see a sleep specialist, but wanted to check here first to see if anyone has experienced something similar or has suggestions I haven't tried yet.

Thanks in advance",1,1732242304.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

Clothes on the floor, toys EVERYWHERE, open markers on the ground, pillows and blankets on the ground, recycling that was pulled from the bin on the ground, etc. And that‚Äôs JUST the kids.

I have had multiple conversations concerning this and nothing has changed. It is so draining to walk in to that every single morning knowing that they will get upset if I don‚Äôt clean it up. There are SO many red flags with this family and this is only one of them. I am only getting $20/hour (which is very low for me).

1gwx3qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1gwx3qf/help_me/,Help me,"I‚Äôve been sitting on this for weeks, and I have no idea what to do anymore. My life feels like one of those wild dramas you‚Äôd read about on Reddit, and now I‚Äôm here, hoping someone out there can help me untangle this mess.

About a year ago, I was at a mutual friend‚Äôs party when I met Liam. He‚Äôs that kind of guy who looks like he just stepped out of a romance novel‚Äîtall, dark, and absolutely gorgeous. We clicked instantly. He was funny, confident, and seemed so genuinely interested in me. One thing led to another, and we started seeing each other casually. It was fun and exciting, but it always felt like there was something missing. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it at the time.

A few months later, I met Sophie. She was this insanely captivating, effortlessly cool woman I ran into at a coffee shop. We started chatting over lattes, and there was this energy between us I‚Äôd never felt before. It was magnetic. What started as casual meetups turned into something I couldn‚Äôt ignore. Before I knew it, I was head over heels for her.

For the first time, I felt seen. She was soft where Liam was bold, deep where Liam was fun. I didn‚Äôt know how to process it at first because I had never felt this way about a woman before, but I couldn‚Äôt deny it. So, I made a tough choice: I broke things off with Liam and threw myself into a relationship with Sophie.

Here‚Äôs where things get even messier. Just a few months into being with Sophie, I got accepted into a program to study abroad in Germany. It was a dream opportunity I couldn‚Äôt pass up, even though it meant leaving Sophie behind. She told me she‚Äôd wait for me, and I promised to stay in touch.

When I got to Germany, I focused on my studies‚Ä¶ but then I met Jonas. He‚Äôs this ridiculously handsome German guy‚Äîlike a literal movie star. He was charming, attentive, and made it clear he was into me from the start. At first, I tried to resist because I was still in love with Sophie, but eventually, I gave in.

Jonas and I had this whirlwind romance that felt completely unreal. We were inseparable. But in the back of my mind, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about Sophie. I stayed in touch with her, texting and FaceTiming constantly. She didn‚Äôt know about Jonas, and I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell her.

After finishing my program, I came back to the U.S., hoping to figure out my feelings. Sophie was thrilled to have me back, and everything with her felt so natural and right. But here‚Äôs the kicker: I‚Äôm still in contact with Jonas. We text almost every day, and I know he‚Äôs still into me. To make things worse (or more complicated?), I just found out I might be pregnant. I haven‚Äôt told anyone yet, not even Sophie or Jonas, because I have no idea what to do.

If I am pregnant, I‚Äôm almost certain Jonas is the father. But I‚Äôm still in love with Sophie, and I don‚Äôt want to lose her. I feel like I‚Äôm living two lives‚Äîone with this amazing woman who makes me feel whole and another with a man who swept me off my feet in a way I didn‚Äôt expect.

So now, I‚Äôm stuck. Do I tell Sophie everything and risk losing her? Do I cut off Jonas and raise this potential baby alone? Do I come clean to everyone and just let the chips fall where they may? I feel like I‚Äôm standing on the edge of a cliff, and no matter what choice I make, I‚Äôm going to fall.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? How do you choose between two completely different kinds of love? And what the hell do I do if there‚Äôs a baby in the picture?",1,1732241838.0,story,0,1.0,False

I (30F) casually dated a guy (30M) I met online from early 2020 to late 2021, who lived in a town about 1.5 hours away. He was living in this town for military pilot training, and once this training was over, he‚Äôd eventually move to my city. We got along super well, and I was SO INTO THIS GUY. Even though we were basically total opposites, I was all in. I have to admit, he was definitely a little toxic‚Ä¶ We were never super serious with our relationship, but we were having fun. Plus it was the pandemic, ya know? Lol.

Long story short, we broke up only a few months before his training ended. This really sucked for obvious reasons because I was left feeling a lot of ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù since we never ended up living in the same city. 

A few months later in early 2022, I started dating someone knew, and all along I knew my ex had moved to my city. I tried not to think of it, and I never saw him or ran into him which was nice. I would think of him every now and again and wonder what part of the city he lived in, if I would run into him, how he‚Äôs doing, etc‚Ä¶ But not very often and truly felt like it was just out of curiosity rather than missing him. I am still dating my current partner and I love him more than anything in this world. I will say though, I still think of my ex from time to time and occasionally keep tabs on him. I HATE to admit that. But I guess I‚Äôm only human.

Fast forward to this past week: I was driving outside of my apartment complex and was STUNNED to see my ex standing on the sidewalk outside a coffee shop next door to my building. I internally freaked out and panicked‚Ä¶it was like the 3 or so years of being blissfully unaware of where he has been flew out the window and I was back at square one of getting over him. I had a PIT in my stomach. I wanted to drive around and do a double take but I knew I shouldn‚Äôt. So I didn‚Äôt.

This led to me to do a little google sleuthing for his address because I was SO curious why he would be there‚Ä¶ And what do I find other than his address that says he lives 400 FEET AWAY FROM ME. His apartment building is literally right next to mine.

And to be clear: I‚Äôve lived in this apartment since we were together. He‚Äôs been here before, he‚Äôs very aware that I live here. I can only assume he moved to this apartment down the road back in early 2022 when he moved to my city. I feel SO WEIRD about that! You‚Äôre telling me we‚Äôve been neighbors for THREE YEARS?!! 

I feel like he‚Äôs been watching me, keeping tabs on me, that it was a total purposeful move‚Ä¶. Now I‚Äôm feeling on guard that I‚Äôll run into him and playing all these scenarios in my head‚Ä¶and I feel really
guilty about it.

How would you feel? What do you think this means? I know it‚Äôs been years and I shouldn‚Äôt care. But I DO CARE. And I hate that. Help!",1,1732241403.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I gained 30 pounds in less than a year studying for my masters in 2019 and thought that was because of the sugary coffee I drank to try to stay up. 

I have always known this but I always assumed that it's because I eat out during this time and high calorie food=higher change of weight gain. 

I am now starting to realize that it's not as simple as that and I just eat way more. I have an exam in 2 weeks. Coupled with the fact that i am on my cycle,  I have been ravenous this week and it is almost impossible to eat within maintenance. 

The eye opening thing is that because I am still tracking calories I am eating a lot less than I would have normally. 

I know this means I have to find healthier ways to manage stress buy I'm glad that I have learned more about my food related weaknesses.",1,1732241084.0,caloriecount,0,1.0,False

I (30F) casually dated a guy (30M) I met online from early 2020 to late 2021, who lived in a town about 1.5 hours away. He was living in this town for military pilot training, and once this training was over, he‚Äôd eventually move to my city. We got along super well, and I was SO INTO THIS GUY. Even though we were basically total opposites, I was all in. I have to admit, he was definitely a little toxic‚Ä¶ We were never super serious with our relationship, but we were having fun. Plus it was the pandemic, ya know? Lol.

Long story short, we broke up only a few months before his training ended. This really sucked for obvious reasons because I was left feeling a lot of ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù since we never ended up living in the same city. 

A few months later in early 2022, I started dating someone knew, and all along I knew my ex had moved to my city. I tried not to think of it, and I never saw him or ran into him which was nice. I would think of him every now and again and wonder what part of the city he lived in, if I would run into him, how he‚Äôs doing, etc‚Ä¶ But not very often and truly felt like it was just out of curiosity rather than missing him. I am still dating my current partner and I love him more than anything in this world. I will say though, I still think of my ex from time to time and occasionally keep tabs on him. I HATE to admit that. But I guess I‚Äôm only human.

Fast forward to this past week: I was driving outside of my apartment complex and was STUNNED to see my ex standing on the sidewalk outside a coffee shop next door to my building. I internally freaked out and panicked‚Ä¶it was like the 3 or so years of being blissfully unaware of where he has been flew out the window and I was back at square one of getting over him. I had a PIT in my stomach. I wanted to drive around and do a double take but I knew I shouldn‚Äôt. So I didn‚Äôt.

This led to me to do a little google sleuthing for his address because I was SO curious why he would be there‚Ä¶ And what do I find other than his address that says he lives 400 FEET AWAY FROM ME. His apartment building is literally right next to mine.

And to be clear: I‚Äôve lived in this apartment since we were together. He‚Äôs been here before, he‚Äôs very aware that I live here. I can only assume he moved to this apartment down the road back in early 2022 when he moved to my city. I feel SO WEIRD about that! You‚Äôre telling me we‚Äôve been neighbors for THREE YEARS?!! 

I feel like he‚Äôs been watching me, keeping tabs on me, that it was a total purposeful move‚Ä¶. Now I‚Äôm feeling on guard that I‚Äôll run into him and playing all these scenarios in my head‚Ä¶and I feel really
guilty about it.

How would you feel? What do you think this means? I know it‚Äôs been years and I shouldn‚Äôt care. But I DO CARE. And I hate that. Help!",3,1732240966.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False
1gwwt4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1gwwt4n/years_of_neurological_episodes_without_seeking/,"Years of neurological episodes without seeking help, finally taking action. ","I (25M, Texas) am currently being evaluated by a neurologist for potential epilepsy, possibly partial seizures. MRI on Monday, EEG January 7th. I am not sure if they could be absence seizures, but here is a recent journal entry that describes my most recent experience:

---

**Journal Entry**

- **7:30 PM**  
 Saw flashing in a video while laying down on my phone. Felt odd afterwards. Tingly face. Like the space I was in was less familiar or changed. Felt like my brain changed like I wasn‚Äôt thinking the same, couldn‚Äôt focus, felt forgetful. Felt a bit detached or distant but hyper-aware. Body felt different. Hard to describe. Not any specific feeling in any specific location but just a vague unease. 

- **7:50 PM**  
 Typed the previous paragraph. Struggled to focus and come up with words. Decided to close my eyes for a bit. I closed my eyes and saw what resembled the rotating light of a lighthouse going from left to right. Got bright for the moment it was ‚Äúfacing‚Äù me. Opened my eyes and got back on my phone. Had a short staring spell (5-10 seconds maybe). Stopped rocking my leg during this time. After spell stopped I still feel like I did before the spell. 

- **8:00 PM**  
 Starting to feel more normal. Transition to normal feeling is like I am dazed or out of it.

- **8:20 PM**  
 Beginning to feel relatively normal. By ‚Äústarting to feel more normal‚Äù in my 8:00pm entry I meant that I started noticing a slight reduction in the feelings. 

---

**Symptoms and Episodes**

Most of my episodes involve staring spells where I feel blank and cannot move easily, though I am aware of my surroundings. These spells usually last 1 to 3 minutes. Sometimes I have no warning, but other times I experience deja vu, phantom smells (like coffee or burning plastic or rubber), or other odd smells or sensations.

Once, immediately after an episode, I had Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, where I felt like a giant and my surroundings shrank. Another time, I saw flashing colors and spots in my vision. Both of these have only occurred once. 

I have told my neurologist all of this, and he said it is illegal for me to drive. He added a ""cannot drive"" note to my medical record. I have an MRI scheduled for Monday and an EEG on January 7. Is it safe to assume he will report this to the medical board to suspend my license? I am not driving right now anyway. If it is epilepsy and medication helps, will I be able to get my license back? I understand why driving before I get this figured out is a bad idea, I am not really upset about this.

---

**Background**

These episodes have been happening for about three years. They seem more frequent now, occurring 2 to 4 times per month. They often happen while I am playing video games or being exposed to flashing lights, but they have happened twice while driving. Both times, I managed to maintain control of my car, though moving my arms felt difficult.

I definitely should have been seen for this a lot sooner, but my severe, diagnosed anxiety made it easier to ignore the issue. I have feared the possibilities of a brain tumor, a past stroke, brain lesions, or brain damage, even though I know the likelihood of these is very low for my age. My anxiety, however, often keeps me from seeking help. I also recognize that ignoring this could increase the risk of more serious problems in the future, but anxiety made avoidance easier.

When I used cannabis regularly, these episodes did not seem to occur. I have mainly used THCA hemp and delta-8 the past few years but used marijuana before that.

Because it may be asked, I have used drugs in the past safely and responsibly, but I have never abused them, and there does not appear to be a correlation between my episodes and drug use, aside from the fact that the episodes did not seem to happen when I was using cannabis heavily.

I have had head injuries in the past but no diagnosed concussions:  
- I hit my head on an uncapped bunkbed pipe by standing (practically jumping) up in to it as a preteen, causing significant bleeding.  
- I hit my head on asphalt as a teen while running.  
- In 2018, I was in a major car accident but escaped with no broken bones or cuts.

**A Unique Neurological Episode (Late 2021)**  

In late 2021, I had a very different episode that lasted 2 to 3 hours. I felt dizzy, confused, and dehydrated despite drinking enough water. I could not complete basic tasks without forgetting what I was doing. For example, I tried packing my laptop but kept forgetting what I was doing mid-action.  

I randomly started cleaning, printing documents, and doing unrelated tasks before realizing I needed to leave. I drove to a gas station to wash my window (???), washed my window, forgot to get gas, and stopped at another gas station to try to get gas, but I sat there for a minute and left without putting gas again. By the time I got home, a 15 minute drive, I still felt out of it.  

I called my brother, but I could only mumble incoherently. Eventually, I managed to get out the words ""blood sugar"" because I thought that might be the issue. He told me to call my uncle, who drove 15 minutes and tested my blood sugar, and it was fine. Afterward, I felt exhausted and went to sleep. This was the only time I experienced something like this, and it been 3 years almost. 

I saw a doctor about it, but since my A1C was normal, they dropped it. In hindsight, more testing should have been done, but I did not advocate for myself. If you‚Äôre still reading, thank you. 

---

**Purpose for the post**

I wanted to share my story, connect with others who have had similar experiences, and ask questions. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Waiting until January for the EEG feels frustrating, but I know I should have sought help sooner.  ",1,1732240959.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

I am a 29F. Usually fit, healthy. Then I suffered a back injury last year and had a micro discectomy this August. I ate terribly after I got injured and because I was in pain I didn‚Äôt exercise aswell. So I went from 145lbs to 160lbs in the last year which is significant considering I am 5‚Äô4. 

My diet after my surgery was mostly whatever was easy and quick as I got tired easily from cooking or standing or dishes all that stuff. Carbs carbs carbs. Feeling terrible I have turned to carnivore diet as I have always loved eating meat. Did a lot of reading and gave it a try. 

Started on nov 17th
Eating two huge meals a day
Beef, eggs, chicken thighs, ham.
Only a little bit of cr√®me in my coffee as it hurts my stomach to have it black in the morning.

I‚Äôve lost 6lbs. Wow
I will update as I‚Äôm planning to follow this for two months to help get my inflammation down, lose some weight and slowly return to the gym.

Goal weight is 140 by January 17th
Wish me luck.

We had a nice, short conversation, and I learned her name. Before I left, I said bye to her and told her it was nice to meet her.

As I was about to leave, she asked if I had Instagram. She said, 'Maybe we could message each other on it.' I told her I did, but my connection in Walmart was spotty, so she asked if she could put her number in my phone. I said yes, and she mentioned we could hang out as friends or something.

The day after that, I texted her and asked how she was. After that, I asked her if she had any fun plans for the weekend."" She then replied, saying, ""I might be free on X day. Why? I asked if, on one of those days, she‚Äôd like to go get coffee. She never responded, which is fine.

The next week, I texted her and said I hoped she was having a great week. She responded saying, ‚ÄòHello.‚Äô I asked her how she was, and she said she was good. She then asked me how I was, and I said I was good.

That text exchange was yesterday. Today, she texted me, but she said, ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs \[insert my name\]?‚Äô I guess she forgot my name or who I was. I texted her back, telling her who I was, and she hasn‚Äôt responded yet.

This is weird to me for a couple of reasons. We‚Äôve texted before, and if she was responding to me, I‚Äôd assume she‚Äôd have my number saved on her phone. Another reason why I find this just a little strange is because she gave me her number, and I texted her the next day saying, 'Hey, it's \[insert name\] from XYZ.

Can you see why I might be a little confused? Reddit was the last place I wanted to go for advice, but I don't have many friends, and I just wanted to make sure my confusion was justified. I want to make sure I'm not going crazy.",1,1732240682.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve determined it‚Äôs the cream. For some reason, some locations seem to use cream that tastes wayyy too‚Ä¶ creamy. Like I take a sip and can only taste cream, even though I just get the regular, single, large, iced coffee cream. 

So I decided to try iced coffee with milk today and it‚Äôs sooooo much better.

Just some small info about her....She was introverted, had a very small circle, not a lot of guys would be chasing her, and she wouldn't be chasing a lot of guys either. She was pansexual. And she later went into nursing at uni

we knew each other for about a year and a few months, maybe 2(my memory is \*\*s) 

We went to the same high school, but we didn't really get to know each other until like grade 11. I finished a creative writing piece and wanted someone's opinion, so I asked her to read it. From that point on she was very much interested in me because she's one of the book-worm kind of girls. That very day she  kept asking me a bunch of questions about my life... what kinds of writing I did, what kind of art I did, she asked for my opinion on her works... it was overall very clear she was interested. We were friends from that point



Fast forward a few months... I was quite conflicted because we developed a friend group with another guy I knew before her...he sort of just tagged along  through time and we had the group. Unfortunately this guy was also interested in the girl...except he wasn't very desirable. Chubby fella, lacks hygiene, didn't shave up his hair... wasn't getting the greatest grades in class.. overall he was kinda just.. ""friend"" material.



We're gonna fast forward another few months. We all hangout every now and then (but I'll specify that she was the one initiating the hangout sessions cuz she. Liked me). I would always try  to show less interest in her because of him. I very much could've had a thing with her but I withdrew from showing too much interested cuz I knew it would break him, I just didn't want to be his friend who ""swooped in and stole his love interest""



This basically led to a decline of us  ALL hanging OUT less, but I did walk with the girl one on one daily before class(in the mornings) for a few weeks, until we just didn't for ...a week...cuz she just stopped showing up. Turns out a new guy asked her out, and they dated for 2 weeks after that. He was her first kiss. I was also in a school committee with her and some other girls  so I had to hear her talk about her first kiss with him...torture. She didn't say they did anything though, and I don't think they did either but that's none of my business.



During the period where she dated him, I wanted to express my self to her but I decided it'd be awkward because now this guy is showing up...and I got nervous... and she seemed happy with him, and seemingly forgot about me during this time(I will specify that I think it's cuz I basically wasted her time with all the effort she put in and me not reciprocating the interest.)



Overall those 2 weeks were pretty sad for me. fast forward like 2 months or so, we don't really talk much now cuz she broke up with him and doesn't hangout in the same place we used to hangout. We graduate high school, and move to university. I still thought about her so  about 4 months into uni I just decided I'd contact her to let her know how I truly felt because I honestly think she's one of the cutest girls I've ever seen. Genuinely. Moving on, she agrees that we hang out and we talk at a coffee shop. I'll also note that I invited her and her sister since that's how we always hung out. I expressed how I've always had a heavy crush on her, and also how I HEAVILY restricted showing interest, I explained how I was nervous, and how I didn't want to hurt the guy's feelings.. I also expressed how sad I was when she got the new dude. We just talked about how we felt back then and how it slowly declined.



Overall the conversation ended with me saying ""I understand if you don't want to hangout anymore, but I just wanted to let you know how I really felt and I'm hoping we can still be friends, maybe hangout some times""...she agreed.. and her sister said something like ""there's always summer"" and I thought it was a good ending. (because the summer she was talking about was the summer we just had)



About like... 2 days later I get a dm from her saying something along the lines of ""hey name, I've had a chance to think about our last conversation, and it does not make me happy. I'm sorry, but I don't want to hang out with you any more.  I wish you the best, but for now, I'm cutting ties. Thank you for understanding""-I was pretty confused here cuz it basically was the exact opposite of what she said during the coffee session, it also seemed ai generated and so professional, like I've never seen her type like that. I've suspected that it was guided by her parents. Or maybe she really did just switch up, I just found it unlikely. I think I responded with ""Is there something I did? I actually don't understand. This was unexpected. I'm sorry if I offended you in anyway and I apologize for making you uncomfortable if I did."" then that was pretty much the end of our conversations.  
  
I'm pretty sure she didn't check the message for like 3 months. I just noticed my snap was delivered but unopened for that amount of time. It's been 10 months so far and I honestly just want to try talking with her. We never dated, but I really wanted to try and I never had the chance to let her see what kind of person I really was. We're not enemies, and we're not close anymore. You've all seen my best memory of our last text message. I miss her dearly. She was a very kind girl and I'm still just mesmerized by her beauty. I REALLY want to text her and try to have another shot

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
TLDR:  
Me and this girl had a crush on each other throughout our senior year in high school, she slowly seemed to lose interest cuz I didn't show enough effort(I didn't because I had a friend that liked her and I didn't want to hurt his feelings). We both graduate and go to uni.. I still had a crush on her so a few months into uni I explained why I didn't show interest in her initially. She agrees that we stay friends, then switches up and dms me that she's cutting ties ""for now"", and 10 months later(right now) I am still missing her and really want to properly express that I'm very interested in her. We had not spoken in the last 10 months(she didn't unfriend or block me anywhere)

\[IMPORTANT NOTE\] she dropped out of uni and is now geographically closer to me.. like 2 kilometers away

\[IMPORTANT NOTE 2\] There's another girl I'm interested in, who's also interested in me, but we haven't spoken much yet, I just don't want to talk to her since I'm more interested in my old crush. I have morals, so I don't think it's right to talk to 2 girls at once... I'd still like your guy's opinion tho. I'll also note that I've been in and out of a relationship in-between  these last 10 months so I haven't just been crushing on the girl I knew in high-school this whole time.

  
I seriously want to ask her out(my old crush), but It might be awkward if she has a partner... and maybe I'm just taking it too literal that she said she didn't want to hangout ""for now"" and maybe she just doesn't want to see me at all. Ever.  
  
Overall I just want to know what you guys would do, or if you had any similar experience that went bad or good.

My Ko-Fi: ¬†[https://ko-fi.com/timeraft](https://ko-fi.com/timeraft)

Somethings wrong with you. You've had your personal issues sure, but lately even you feel out of control, but you cant help it. You've been lashing out at people who care about you and your behavior is becoming more and more self destructive. Your coworker has noticed, but what can she do? Apparently there's actually a lot she can do about it. Because she's actually a magical girl. Or at least as much of a magical girl as a burnt out perpetually single thirty year old can be.

  
Dialogue in plain text

*context in italics*

**SFX in BOLD**

***Context that changes the audio in bold italics***

  


***Listener¬† is in a park near their workplace the speaker sees them and yells after them***



Hey!¬†



Hey you!



Yeah you get over here!



*Listener ignores them*



Don't walk away from me!



***Speaker follows***



Yeah it's me, Brooke!



Brooke from logistics! I complimented your jacket yesterday, remember?



***Listener stops***



We talk about the Pacers sometimes?



***They start walking again***¬†



Don't fu-don't you walk away from me!



***Speaker chases them***



Look buddy you've been acting like a real jerk lately! You're alienating your friends you're snapping at people who did *nothing* wrong and you're treating your coworkers like dirt. What's gotten into you, you prick?!  


Hey hey Look at me!



What's going on with you!? You used to be so kind! This is out of character.



Stop!¬†



Show me your arm!



***Speaker grabs the listener's arm***.

  


I don't care, show me! Now! I won't ask again¬†



***She rolls up their sleeve to reveal a strange mark that looks something like a solar eclipse. Listener is disturbed, they'd never noticed it before.***



You see that mark? You see that?



Oh never noticed it before huh? Idiot! You know out of all my coworkers I would not have bet on you being the one who got possessed. Shows what I know I guess.



Don't give me that look! You're possessed by a shadow demon!



No, I don't think I'm going to explain any further. Idiot!¬†



I mean you! Of all people! I have the worst luck.



Look, just hold still. I hate chasing people.



***Slightly distorted voice***



By the stars I swear. Light shall shine upon this world again. From the mountains of the ancients to the fires of Genesis. LET JUSTICE BE DONE!!!!



***MAGICAL GIRL TRANSFORMATION SEQUENCE***¬†



There is a demon in your heart turning your darkest thoughts against you and those you love! I cannot allow this!



I am Brooke, Scion of the stars! Witch of Andromeda! With my awesome magic I shall reclaim the night!



**Strikes pose**¬†



The hell you looking at?



Look this is going to make a lot more sense when the demon comes out of you in like thirty seconds



Wait for it



Waaaaaaiiiitttt for it



***Listeners shadow detaches from their body and forms a demonic version of them***



Yeah you see? I don't look so weird now do I? Your shadow just turned into a demonic clone of your stupid face. The demon is coming out to defend itself.



Yeah so that's why you've been acting like an ass lately. This uh thing was sort of like amplifying your darkest thoughts.¬†



Happens more often than you might think honestly.¬†



***Listener is freaking out***



Oh my God you're such a baby. Get behind me I'll take care of it.



STAR SPELL: RED SHIFT!!!!!!



**Magic sounds**



God I don't know why I open with that one. It never works. Guess there's at least some part of me that's still an optimist



**Deep breath**¬†



STAR SPELL: DESTRUCTION NEBULA!!!!!!



**Magic sounds**¬†



*demon is unharmed*¬†



Ok! That's not fair! That one always works!



You know what? Plan B! I'll just use my other magic wand.



**GUN SHOTS!!!**



Heh. Didn't see that coming did ya? Demon punk! Eat Glock!



**More gunshots**



***Demon dissolves into smoke and reattaches to listener***



What?¬†



Hey I got concealed carry! Might as well use it.



Look I'd explain everything but you're gonna fall unconscious in like I dunno, ten seconds? Give or take? The demon is hiding in you now.



Don't worry I got y-



***Listener tried to run away but falls unconscious***¬†



Or you can run away. sure



**THUNK**



***SLOWLY FADES OUT***



idiot¬†



***Listener wakes back up. They're tied to a chair with Bungie cords in her trailer surrounded by cats. The speaker is scooping out a litter box and muttering to herself***¬†



Stupid freaking cats. I knew I should have gone with geckos or mice or something but nooooooo I had to feel bad about it and now I've got four litter boxes to clean and the whole trailer park thinks I'm a crazy cat lady! God, I hate my life.



Carol stop rubbing on me, I'm trying to scoop! This is why the other cats don't like you y'know. You're a brown noser.



***listener is awake they start yelling and startle the speaker***



**Surprised yelp**



Oh great, you're awake¬†



Don't yell like that! You scared me!¬†



*Listener tries to yell and she shushes them by touching their lips with her finger.*



Ah ah ah no yelling. I'm in a really bad mood and I'm the one with the magic wand, you want to push me?¬†



That's right. Let's use our inside voices shall we?

  


Yeah sorry not sorry about tying you up. You've still got a demon living in you last I checked.



Yeah no shooting it discorporated it but I still need to destroy it. Otherwise it'll just recharge and come back out next week. I found that out after I killed one by ramming it with a garbage truck.

  


Hey by any chance have you seen a lady with long dark hair and icy blue eyes? Kinda Evanescence vibes? 



Here I got a Polaroid somewhere.



**Rustles through papers on the table. Shows the listener a blurry Polaroid of a dark haired woman.**

  


This chick. You seen her?



Waitress at the diner eh?



Which one? The one on Cedar up by the Sam's club or the one on Jolly  downtown?



Huh I didn't know there was one in Little Belgrade.¬†



Oh uh yeah that's Morgana 9 she's an evil space witch.¬†



She's using a cursed artifact called the dark grail to sow chaos across the world, by turning people into demons for some reason. Because she's sad about her boyfriend dying or something. Honestly I think she's just a jerk.



She's probably the one who planted the seed of that demon inside of your soul. Did you drink anything she offered you?¬†



Coffee? Well I hope it was good because it almost killed you.



The uh demon sort of grows out of your personal issues. It starts by just sort of warping your perceptions and turning you into a giant douche, but over time as you sleep it starts to manifest physically and wreak havoc. Eventually it sucks away your life force as it manifests more. It becomes smarter and smarter and more able to impersonate you until eventually you shrivel away into nothing and it becomes the new you. It's kinda grisly.



In your case the demon went around smashing up cars and breaking windows and stuff. It didn't really have time to develop into something more focused. You're lucky.



You have a lot of pent up frustration don't you? Probably some unfair pressure from an authority figure too. Mom or dad?



Mom eh? I guess I can relate.



You should probably have tried to seek out some professional help.



Oh shut up. Our insurance covers it, you know that. We're on the committee together.¬†



Well in any case too late for that now.



What happens next?



Oh I'm going to cast a spell to exorcise the demon. Then I'll probably turn you into one of these.



**Cat meows**



*Listener starts freaking out*¬†



***Mocking voice***



‚ÄúNo, please let me go! I'll be good!‚Äù



You think I never tried just letting people go! You know what happened? They slipped back into the darkness and she just demonized them again! Like Carol there!



**She points at a black cat that's rubbing up to the listeners legs**¬†



Oh sure she looks innocent but she got demon possessed three times!



Three times! People got hurt! And I realized I could either spend the rest of my mortal existence playing a losing game of demonic whack-a-mole or find a way to MAKE SURE nobody relapsed!



So until I finally hunt down Morgana 9 and beat her for good everybody is just gonna have to suck it up and eat their kibble! Sorry not sorry!



*They needed to get that out of their system*¬†



Alright I've never actually done this before. Usually I just wait for the demon to manifest and kill it with magic.¬†



Relax this probably won't hurt.



Oh my God man! Suck it up! This is what you get for not facing your inner demons! Maybe if you'd just dealt with your frustration instead of bottling it up we wouldn't be here! Don't blame me!



*Listener starts crying*¬†



Oh my God they're crying. They're crying!



Ughhhhhhh why do I do this to myself!



You know I don't have to do this crap! You think I like walking around in tights and a miniskirt? You think I like chasing demons while wearing heeled boots? I just shot an evil demon clone of my cute coworker in the face! And I'm gonna have nightmares about that for the next month. You think this is how I want to spend my evenings?



I want to sit over there on my couch, watch Grey's Anatomy, drink wine from a coffee mug, and knit a baby blanket for my cousin. But no!¬†



I do what I do, because nobody else ever stepped up. I'm not some chosen one! I just stepped up because last time I checked nobody else was lining up to fight the demons!¬† If there was somebody else to take my place I'd let them!¬†



But I'm it! The only thing standing between her and the city is me! Brooke! Gosh darned Brooke from gosh darned logistics! I'm it! I'm the one who went to the star goddess and demanded she do something about this mess! And she gave me these powers. so I have to use them.



Apparently this outfit was non negotiable. I can't even take off the stupid gloves.



You're a threat to other people but most of all you're a threat to yourself! so unfortunately I have to deal with you! Show me a little dignity!



**Deep breath.** ***They adopt a more empathetic manner***¬†



Here let me wipe those tears. You're a mess.



I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry.



That's it, deep breath. Deep breath.¬†



Look, I like you. You know that?



I always try to talk to you at work because I think you're cute and funny and sweet. I never realized how much you were eating yourself up inside. I'm sorry, maybe there was something I could have done. Maybe I should have seen it. Maybe some of this is on me.



Let's get the demon out and we can talk more alright? We'll start there.



***Distorted voice***¬†



By the stars I pray. Let the demon be gone



***Smooch on the cheek***¬†



***listener starts shaking as the demon gets banished.***



Sorry the kiss is part of the spell.



*It kinda wasn't*¬†



Deep breath deep breath.¬†



Look at me ok. It's working. Look at me.¬†



Shhhh it's leaving. Don't look, but you can feel it right? You can feel it. Look at me.



Shhhh



Feels good right? Like a big old weight has left your shoulders? You can have this moment of peace at least. Savor it.



Here. Let me untie your arms. I'll leave your legs bound for now.



***Hands listener some tea***



Drink this. It's chamomile tea It'll settle you a bit.¬†



***Sighs***



I wish it didn't have to be this way.¬†



I understand how you wound up here. Hell in another world maybe I'd be sitting where you are. It's not fair and I know that.



I get what it's like to feel the way you do. I really do. I'm older than you, so I have a bit more experience with disappointment.



You feel like you're not getting anywhere. Your life is passing you by but you aren't enjoying the present either. You feel like you missed out on something you should have had. You feel like you can't do anything right.



I really get that feeling. The anger at the world. The hatred of yourself. I feel it too. It hurts. Life sucks. It always has and probably always will. I can't sugarcoat that.¬†



But you can't take that out on everyone else. You can't become a threat to people just trying to live their lives. And that demon makes you that. If you can't face your inner demons I don't have a choice but to make you into a cat. I'm not happy about it , but it's the way it's gotta be. I don't have the resources to get you or any of these other people the help you need.¬†



Turning you into a cat is just a bandaid. I know that it's not a long term solution but it's all I got. I can magic a demon out of you, but I can't help you get better in the head. And I can't risk letting you hurt anybody else. That's not a gamble I'm willing to make. Great power and responsibility and such.¬†

  


***Sighs***¬†



Fine. You get one chance to convince me otherwise. Go for it. Make your case.

  


Ughhhh I guess you have a point¬†



We work together. I feel like I can keep track of you. I'll be able to tell if you get possessed.¬†



Ughhhhh



Fine. Fine. You can stay human, but! there's three conditions.¬†



First we're going to get you into counseling. You have to deal with these issues. I know the agency that takes our insurance isn't the best and the waiting list is long, but it's something. You have to try.¬†



Second, if you see her again you drop everything and you come to me. I need to face her. That's the root of all of this. Then I can change all these people back.



Third, you have to check in with me every day. I don't care if it's just a quick talk in the parking lot, I just need to make sure the demon doesn't return.¬†



You fail to check in? You become a cat. No second chances.



If at any point I feel like this isn't working you better learn to like tuna. Don't think I won't.



Those are my terms. Do we have a deal?



Alright. Come on, let's get some dinner I haven't eaten all day.



***Slightly distorted voice***¬†



By the stars, return me to my mortal form.



***She changes back into her business outfit***



Here let's untie your legs. I'm feeling Thai food tonight. How's that sound?



Come on, take my hand. You look like you need something warm.

I think of you a lot but it doesn‚Äôt affect me like it used to, I try to hate u but there‚Äôs no passion in my emotion. 
I‚Äôve moved on but my curiosity will never, I will always want to share a beer with you. I dream of sharing my wine with you and my coffee in the mornings, I dream of endless conversations dissecting every emotion we‚Äôve felt together. 

There is no way of contacting you and that‚Äôs the biggest gift you‚Äôve given me. I‚Äôll always want you around but I like having myself around more. Have you forgiven me? I haven‚Äôt completely yet. 
I was so lost back then. I‚Äôm sorry, real love should not hurt you. 
You were there always and you know about these things.

I‚Äôm back in town but you won‚Äôt see me. 
Do you think we would be friends if you met me today? I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôd still share any interests, would you still think I‚Äôm cool today?
My hair hasn‚Äôt been that short in a long time. I‚Äôm quite boring now, a quiet life. 

I forgot what your face looked like, I forgot what your voice sounds like. I avoid anywhere you could possibly be while hoping I meet you in the most random corners‚Äîhaha. I hope you live life to the fullest. 


I‚Äôm grateful for every time you disappeared even though I pray for your reappearance. 
I don‚Äôt feel shame anymore.
I cling to nothing and I don‚Äôt care if everyone sees. 
My desperation is precious to me. 

It‚Äôs been hard to date again, you must‚Äôve heard the news. It broke my heart when you didn‚Äôt reach out, but I understood. I grieved alone.

I knew exactly where the carefully laid out traps were, designed to cripple strangers. 

Mom instructed me to meet her at the elder tree, under a crescent moon. 

Tipping my head back, a sliver of moonlight poked through the thick canopy of trees, and I shivered, tightening my grip around the box of pig hearts. I wasn't expecting candlelight under the elder tree, blurred orange lighting up the dim. 

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I started forwards hesitantly, quickening my steps. 

I wasn't looking where I was going, searching for her familiar ghostly face, when I glimpsed a figure bowed under the tree. Someone was praying.

I took another step, and another, until my worn converse were stepping in something wet, a pooling darkness soaking the ground. 

I didn't feel the box slip from my hands, or hear my own cry slice through the silence. I should have known. Still lit candles, blood that was still warm, still wet, soaking into the ground. 

I was on my knees, suddenly, retching, sobbing into familiar sandy curls that were so distinct, so familiar.

Bile shot up my throat. 

My trembling hands didn't feel real, trying to find a pulse. 

Trying to find his *face*. 

Jonas‚Äôs body had been perfectly laid out, his head severed from his torso. 

He was another sacrifice, another body left to rot. 

I screamed for my mother, pulling my brother‚Äôs body to my chest and holding him, stroking his skin covered in markings. 

*Luhar*. 

*Nathur*. 

*Velilua*. 

‚ÄúMom.‚Äù I didn't trust my own voice, my broken screech ripping through my lips. I pulled what was left of my brother to my chest, rocking him, burying my face in his hair. I could have saved him. 

I could have fucking saved him. 

I was so *close*. 

So close.

‚ÄúNin.‚Äù

I was shrieking, trying to justify my brother‚Äôs death, trying to scream for my mother, when warm arms wrapped around me, pulling me into a clumsy embrace. I didn't want it.

I didn't want him anywhere near me, a constant fucking reminder that I chose him over my own flesh and blood‚Äì the one person I had left. I tried to shove him away, my voice breaking into words, words that didn't make sense, words that should have hurt him, words I instantly regretted. 

But he was warm. 

When his arms wrapped around me once again, this time harsher, and yet closer, an anchor keeping me from well and truly falling, plunging into despair. 

He smelled like cheap cologne and stale coffee, but I found myself clinging onto it, clinging onto him, and letting myself fucking break. 

When my cries were raw and broken and dying out, the muted world came back to me in sputters. I was half aware of Rowan kneeling in front of me, his head buried in my shoulder.

He was trembling, or maybe *I* was trembling, the two of us felt both right and wrong, and losing myself in his smell, his heavy breaths and murmurs that everything was going to be okay, I realized he was home. 

Bathed in moonlight that bounced off him‚Äì and I was so thankful it did, Rowan Beck didn't sympathise with me‚Äì and that was okay, because I didn't want his pity.

But he did pull me to my feet, steadying me when my legs gave-way. 

‚ÄúNin,‚Äù his voice didn't feel real, waves crashing against rocks. ‚Äú*look* at me.‚Äù

In my half-delirious state, I did, my chest heaving, my stomach contorting‚Äì I couldn't fucking breathe. I couldn't *breathe*, and his eyes were what caught me off guard. 

Brown, with hints of ember-like orange. 

‚ÄúWe can walk away,‚Äù he said, softly. ‚ÄúYou and me. We can go back to the car, and  not look back.‚Äù

Twin footsteps behind me sent my body into fight or flight. But they were familiar, hesitant at first, then quickening. 

Before I knew what was happening, Imogen‚Äôs face was buried in my shoulder, and Kaz‚Äôs arms awkwardly pulled me into a hug. Rowan wrapped his arm around my shoulder, the three of them dragging me away from my brother‚Äôs body. 

I caught Rowan‚Äôs glance at Jonas‚Äîhis eyes glittering with tears.

He looked away, his lip wobbling. 

‚ÄúLet's go home,‚Äù was all he said, leading the way back to the car. Imogen was quick to pull my head onto her lap in the backseat and I remember the lull of the car swaying me back and forth. 

The three of them took me back to their home, pulled me upstairs, and tucked me into my bed. 

I didn't speak for a long time‚Äì but I didn't need to. 

Imogen brought me meals and drinks, sometimes curling into bed with me, running her fingers through my hair‚Äì telling me stories.

Kaz sat by my bed like a personal therapist, repeatedly telling me I was okay‚Äì I was safe. Nobody was going to hurt me. Rowan kept his distance for a while. But then he started to appear in my doorway, scowling his usual scowl. 

‚ÄúDo you want to, uhhh, maybe watch a movie?‚Äù turned into the two of us binge watching everything. 

I'm not sure when it was when I turned to him for emotional relief. 

When I found myself wrapped around him, my head nestled on his shoulder.

When I stopped resenting him for being here‚Äì while my brother *wasn't*. 

The memory jerked, pulling me back to the real world. 

Back to lying under the moon‚Äôs light, as she hollowed me out. 

My voice had been burned from my throat, my body a puppet cut from its strings. I was partially aware of Her filling my blood, hitting every dead nerve ending, entangling around my skull and delving into my brain. 

Rowan was still there, his breath in my ear, choked with hysterical giggles. 

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúWho would have thought that the *whole* time, you were the fucking problem?‚Äù Rowan leaned closer. ‚ÄúThat *you* ruined the lives of three strangers, and inserted yourself into their little family.‚Äù he jumped back, ‚ÄúIt's kinda poetic.‚Äù

I bit back a cry when his fingers tiptoed down my arm. 

‚ÄúFunny how that works, huh.‚Äù

With no mouth, no *voice*, I couldn't respond. 

‚ÄúI wanna show you one morreeee thing,‚Äù he sang. ‚ÄúIt's what she showed *me*, Nin,‚Äù he sighed, his eyes basking in her light. ‚ÄúIt's what turned me into this.‚Äù 

Suddenly, she wasn't subtle anymore, speaking directly through him, his voice turning melodic, watery. ‚ÄúOh, darling, you should have seen his face‚Äì his mind broke into pieces, and I put him back together again!‚Äù

Rowan leaned closer, her light seeping from him, scolding my skin. ‚ÄúAgain and again, and *again*, until he stopped screaming, *begging* me for mercy,‚Äù she  mocked his cry, ‚Äúand finally let meeeee in.‚Äù

He prodded me in the face, giggling. 

‚ÄúJust like *you* did! When you finally offered me young Rowan as a King.‚Äù

The moon gripped my chin, forcing me to look at him. His lips grazed mine, chuckling. 

‚ÄúAsk me how I died, Nin. *Please*.‚Äù 

His head tipped back, lips parting in a moan. ‚ÄúIt's all he wants to hear‚Äì oh, his tortured mind and soul, *wants* to hear you say it.‚Äù

I didn't have to ask. The memory was already slamming into me. 

Three figures in our doorway, each of them I knew. 

Dex, Noah, and Harry.

Three of the moon cult‚Äôs brainwashed followers. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not interested.‚Äù Kaz stood in front, his arms folded. ‚ÄúLeave.‚Äù

When Noah pulled out a gun, shooting Kaz dead, the world spun around. 

Imogen crumpled into a heap, and I didn't even see the bullet hit her. 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù

I only found my voice when Rowan was bleeding out in my arms, his eyes flickering back and forth, blood spilling from his lips. I told him not to speak, and not to be scared. Holding him to my chest, I told him that no matter what, I was going to save him.

The moon‚Äôs followers left quickly, knowing exactly what I was going to do. Wrapping them in a knitted blanket I pulled off of Rowan‚Äôs bed, I dumped their bodies in Kaz‚Äôs car, and drove to the town lake. Mom wanted vessels for royals. 

She *wanted* human skins for the moon‚Äôs light. 

I carved her name into the dirt, and my plea to her light.

Even coming back as her puppets, her royals, King's and a Queen drenched in blood, they would still be *alive*. 

So we would keep living together‚Äì our family. 

The family I didn't know I wanted - no, *needed* - until they were gone. 

Luhar. 

Nathur.

Velilua.

Sobbing, my trembling fingers kept messing up. 

I picked up Kaz‚Äôs body, and dropped him into the lake.

Purify. 

I scooped Imogen into my arms, carefully lowering her into the shallows, before crawling over to Rowan, who was so still, so cold, his dead eyes tracking the dark sky. I bent down and kissed him, an eternal binding, a promise, that I wasn't letting him go. 

She came quicker than I thought, illuminating the shallows I was sitting in, ankle deep, his head on my lap. 

Her song bled inside my skull, curious, sending a shiver down my spine. 

‚ÄúOh, my sweet child,‚Äù She hummed, Her voice somehow benevolent, yet mocking.

‚ÄúI am *so* sorry for your loss, Nina. They were sweet souls.‚Äù

‚ÄúBring them back.‚Äù I lurched forward, burying my head in the ground. 

Praying, just like my mother. 

I could sense Her already seeping inside them, malevolent and greedy. 

*‚ÄùI can take it all away,‚Äù She murmured, filling my head with could-have-beens. 

It was just me and them, living in Bolivia House. 

There were no cults, no dead brothers. I didn't realize how much I wanted it until I begged Her, letting Her pick apart my brain. My own voice faded as She dragged it from my mouth, filling me with bliss, with the life I had always craved. 

*‚ÄúBring them back!‚Äù* I buried my head in my knees, sobbing. 

Her glow was warm, soothing my aching bones. 

‚ÄúIn any way I want?‚Äù She hummed. ‚ÄúAny *shape* I want?‚Äù

Her voice trickled through me. *‚ÄúI can shape and mould them in annnnnny way I desire?‚Äù*

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I gritted out, digging my nails into the ground. 

‚ÄúGive him to me.‚Äù she commanded. 

I did, gently pushing Rowan off my lap, letting the water envelope him. 

She drew back with a melodic laugh, Her light illuminating the water, before dancing behind the clouds. 

When the first prickles of dawn broke through the sky, I was sitting on the riverbank with my head balanced on my knees. Confusion swiftly followed by panic crept down my spine. I couldn't remember *why* I was there so late. 

Why, when I swiped at my eyes, I was crying. 

‚ÄúNin? Come on, we‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù

Twisting around, Imogen Prairie stood behind me, shivering in shorts and a t-shirt, her sandals hanging from one hand. She pulled me to my feet, grinning. 

‚ÄúThat is the *last* time we go moon-watching with the boys,‚Äù she laughed, tugging me closer. I found myself revelling in her warmth. ‚ÄúI can't feel my feet!‚Äù

We traipsed our way back to the car, where Kaz was waiting, a knitted blanket over his shoulders. Impatient, as usual, arms folded, like a divorced father of three. 

I smirked at the raybans perched on his head. ‚ÄúYou're looking progressively more dad-like as the days go by.‚Äù

Kaz shot me the finger, his lips curving into a smirk. 

‚ÄúFuck off, Nin.‚Äù

He threw the keys at Imogen. ‚ÄúSince you enjoy complaining, you can drive us home.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe barely complained!‚Äù 

He shot me a pointed look. ‚ÄúWere you knocked on the head? She ranted about mosquitoes for three hours.‚Äù

Imogen scoffed, jumping into the driver's seat. ‚ÄúOf course I enjoy complaining! It's one of many things I'm good at.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe *only* thing she's good at,‚Äù Rowan grumbled from the backseat, his chin perched on Kaz‚Äôs seat once I wiggled in with him. I could tell he'd slept in the car. 

When Imogen thwacked him on the head, he groaned. ‚ÄúShe's just pissed I forgot the bug spray.‚Äù He rolled his eyes, reaching for his flask and taking a long drink. 

He spat it out immediately, all over his lap. 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù Kaz shrieked, ‚ÄúThis is a new car!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's fucking disgusting.‚Äù Rowan swiped his mouth, and I laughed. ‚ÄúWhat *is* that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's coffee, Einstein,‚Äù Kaz twisted around in his seat, his eyebrows furrowing. ‚ÄúI made it earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it tastes like shit!‚Äù he shoved the flask in Kaz‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúHere. Try it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't wanna taste shitty coffee, dude.‚Äù

Rowan groaned, bouncing in his seat like a little kid. ‚ÄúNo, seriously, try it!‚Äù

Kaz did, rolling his eyes, before he too lost his composure and spat it out.

‚ÄúUrgh!‚Äù

‚ÄúStop throwing up all over the car!‚Äù Imogen squeaked, gripping the wheel. ‚ÄúDo I really need to remind two grown adults not to make a mess?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's not my fault Kaz brewed expired coffee!‚Äù Rowan shot back. 

I looked at Kaz for some kind of explanation, but he looked oddly sickly. 

‚ÄúYou're serious,‚Äù I said, when Kaz sent me a wounded puppy look. 

‚ÄúRowan's right,‚Äù he stuck out his tongue. ‚ÄúThat tastes like literal fucking ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou two are animals,‚Äù Imogen muttered, flicking on the radio. 

Curious, I snatched the coffee from Rowan‚Äôs lap and took a hesitant sip. 

Coffee. 

It was nice and bitter, running down my throat. 

‚ÄúI have no idea what you're talking about,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt tastes *fine*.‚Äù

Rowan ignored me, tipping his head back, groaning.

‚ÄúHey, can we stop at a drive-thru?‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI'm like, *really* fucking hungry.‚Äù

The memory shattered into nothing, and I was yanked back to reality. 

This time, though, I wasn't in pain anymore. 

Pain didn't exist. 

Only the skylight above, the moon shining down on me, and their teeth ripping through me, their hands snapping my bones one by one, scooping up my insides and gorging on me. 

I was still alive, still breathing without lungs, without a heart, without a brain to think with, to form logical thought. 

Three shadows, three royals, drenched in red and bearing human flesh as shauls, human bones as jewelled crowns. With no mouth to scream with, I allowed them to rip me apart, over and over, and trying to tear into the black and white static stitching me back together again. They were merciless, never stopping or faltering, gorging themselves. 

With me.

I think I started to understand, when I could no longer recognise Kaz through the thick beads of red running down his face. 

The slithering human flesh that was still alive, patching his skin back together. 

Imogen‚Äôs empty eyes. 

Rowan‚Äôs monstrous, grinning snarl as he choked on my pulsing flesh. 

I couldn't save them.

However, thanks to my memories, I knew exactly how to kill them. 

My eyes found Rowan, the most merciless, ripping me apart, even when I was barely together, tangled static.

Kill him. 

For *good*. 

‚ÄúThat's right,‚Äù the cult-woman's voice soothed the royals, coaxing them to continue. ‚ÄúThere you go. Eat, my darlings.‚Äù

I didn't react to the voice. I couldn't. 

I wouldn't. 

The woman with greying hair and a beautiful, youthful glow. 

Who worshipped the moon, and murdered my brother. 

Maybe the moon was actually empathetic, ripping away my memories of her.

I woke up screaming.

Through flickering lashes, I could make out Bolivia House‚Äôs skylight. 

Something ice-cold trickled down my spine, and something like d√©j√† vu slammed into me. I was back where it all began‚Äîwhere everything went wrong. 

I could sense it, feel it, like a living entity creeping across the flesh of my face and down my neck, wrapping around my spine. 

The light was all too familiar but stronger‚Äîstronger than it had ever been‚Äîenrapturing my housemates' eyes and dancing across the sky: a sentient, celestial light that turned them into monsters.

This time, it was in my eyes, drowning them, polluting them, filling my vision with mesmerizing luminescence I couldn't look away from. Taking slow breaths didn't help; my screams ripped from me like they weren't mine, like I was possessed. I was‚Ä¶ bleeding out. 

My skin was slick with wet warmth, my hair glued to the back of my neck. 

I was dying.

That was my first real thought when my eyes flickered open once again, and the first thing I did was choke up lumps while streaks of scarlet trickled from my lips, my head jerking, clanging against something cold and metallic. 

I could feel it already staining my chin and neck, dripping down my skin, seeping from my nose and ears. 

When clarity started to hit me, so did awareness. I tried to roll onto my face to relieve the burning, but I couldn't move. Futilely, I tugged at my arms before realizing they were cruelly strapped down. 

The blood in my mouth tasted familiar. 

I almost swallowed a coin as a kid. I was bored, playing in my room, when the childish thought struck me, my gaze glued to a quarter cupped in my hand. 

I didn't think, placing it on my tongue, and immediately spit it out. I remember choking on the now familiar taste, a thick, metallic tint that settled on my tongue. 

*‚ÄùWhat are you doing?‚Äù*

The voice was familiar to my little-self, but my present self rejected it, a monstrous screech clawing from my lips‚Äì one that I couldn't control, that crept from deep within the recesses of my mind, ripping the air from my lungs. 

I was already speaking, whimpering, the words tangled and wrong, slipping from my lips. No. I screamed into darkness, trying to rip myself from the memory. 

But it was relentless, already pulling me, plunging me into twisting oblivion. 

This voice was a stranger to me‚Äì and yet, all of me, my contorting and writhing mind and thoughts and my two hundredth body, *did* know them. 

The memory faded into white noise, but I did see my little self jump to my feet, and dance over to the stranger, wrapping my arms around them. They were warm, and somehow, I knew their smell. Raspberry scented shampoo and banana pudding. 

*‚ÄùYou're not *allowed* to put coins in your mouth,‚Äù* the figure with no face stated matter-of-factly. With the memory struggling to paint a real picture, I only saw a moving blur. It was a kid. 

Same age. I could just about glimpse a threadbare t-shirt with a Spider-Man logo, and odd socks. The further I teetered on the edge of the memory, details started to blossom. 

I had a *Totally Spies!* themed lamp on my beside, plastic stars twinkling on my ceiling. 

The blurry figure folded their arms. ‚ÄúI thought you were playing dollhouses?‚Äù

My younger self flopped onto bright pink carpet, crawling over to a wooden dollhouse. ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo you want to be the baby?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The blurry figure grumbled. ‚ÄúI don't like being the baby. The baby is *stupid*.‚Äù

I grabbed a pink-haired barbie and thrust it in their face. ‚ÄúFine. You can be Primrose!‚Äù

They sighed, and dropped onto their knees, making the doll dance across my fluffy rug. ‚ÄúOkay, but *only* if Primrose is a spy.‚Äù

My younger self groaned. ‚ÄúBut we played Spies last time!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, so? I like it. I don't like playing Hospitals, or Mommy and Daddy, or Doctor Nina.‚Äù 

I shoved them, and they scoffed, shoving me back. 

‚ÄúYou can't hit me.‚Äù they said, giggling. ‚ÄúIt's *my* turn to play, and‚Ä¶‚Äù when they jumped up, spreading out their arms, I got another glimpse of this stranger, this enigma in my head‚Äì that my body knew, and my brain didn't. ‚ÄúI say we play Spies, where Primrose and Barbie are kidnapped by an evil professor and turned into pigs‚Äì‚Äù

I cut them off, shrieking. *‚ÄúMom!‚Äù* 

I wasn't expecting my past cry to rip from my present lips. Mom. The words felt so real, like I was still speaking them, but the name was mismatched oblivion. 

When I tried to reach for it, I couldn't. Whatever it was, and whoever this person had been, was trapped behind walls of my own making, towering metal sky-scrapers, completely impenetrable. 

But there was still that name hanging on. *Jonas is being mean. Jonas isn't letting me play. Jonas is stealing my cookie. Jonas keeps kicking me!* 

My voice grew older, and I found myself skimming through my childhood. There were no visual memories, only my voice, highlighting fragments of what was lost. 

*‚ÄùMom, Jonas won't let me play on the PS3.‚Äù* 

*‚ÄùDad, can you tell Jonas to clean up after dinner?‚Äù*

This time, my voice was laughing, giggling. *‚ÄùOh my god, Jonas, what did you do to your hair? Mom is going to kill you!‚Äù*

*‚ÄùYou smoke? Jonas, do you want to fuck up your lungs?!‚Äù*

Older. 

Sixteen, or maybe seventeen. 

""I don't want to be here,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""Neither does Jonas. This place freaks us out. It's a fucking cult! Can't you understand that? Mom, can we leave? Mom, please, look at me!""
 
As if my memory was reacting to my present self, my younger self started to break too. *‚ÄùMom?‚Äù* Her voice was suddenly so small, like a child. 

*‚ÄùMommy, please don't do this to us. Please.‚Äù* 

I could feel my younger self‚Äôs chest heaving with sobs. *‚ÄùI want to go home, Mom. I don't want to be‚Äì‚Äù* she broke, and then she kept breaking, over and over again, splintering into tiny pieces. 

*‚ÄùI don't want to be here. It's a cult, Mom. They're going to kill us!‚Äù*

She grew older, but her voice was hollow and wrong, barely breaking the sound barrier. I sensed the weakness in her bones, the mental and physical agony weighing her down, and the overwhelming urge to just let go. 

It wasn't clear what I was seeing. It was pitch dark, the darkness lit up in warm candlelight. But I didn't feel warm. 

I was wobbling, struggling to stand. ‚ÄúJonas.‚Äù I whispered, nudging the streak of *nothing* next to me, who quickly morphed into a young boy. Seventeen or eighteen. He shared my thick blonde hair and hollow eyes. Jonas was my brother. 

I had‚Ä¶ I had a *brother*. I was standing in dirt, my feet bare, watching the latest sacrifice. I was dressed head to toe in a long, white flowing dress that pooled at my feet. The material made me squirm, itchy against my skin. 

But no matter how many times I tore it apart, Mom begged Father for forgiveness, and patched it back together. Jonas stood in matching white, a short sleeved shirt and clinical coloured pants that barely fit him. Mia and Teo‚Ä¶ 

They didn't want to die. 

In front of me, there they knelt, beheaded, their blood spilling into the dirt under seeping moonlight. Mia and Teo had outlines. All of the children brought in by their brainwashed parents had outlines. 

Which meant‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre next.‚Äù

Jonas spoke through his teeth, his gaze going to the moon poking from the clouds. 

‚ÄúThey've filled Mom‚Äôs head with this moon bullshit, and she's going to use us as vessels.‚Äù he turned to me, terror that he couldn't hide anymore ignited in his eyes. 

Jonas turned back to the sacrifice, and our mother, her head tipped back, awaiting something that was never going to happen. Mom really was gone. I should have seen it in the relaxed muscles in her face, her vacant eyes and wide smile.

I was in denial, until I watched her carve into my friend‚Äôs skin, speaking of *blessings* while ignoring their screams of pain. 

Each potential sacrifice had to have her words sliced into their arms and neck. 

I knew each one perfectly, after having them quite literally nailed into my skull. 

*Thamvi* was carved under the elbow. 

And like flowing water, the rest followed, all the way down the arm. Mom‚Äôs handiwork was always so perfect, managing to ignore the sacrifices begging and pleading with her to stop. 

She never showed mercy, tightening her hold on the knife, carving deeper. 

Their skin her canvas, and their blood her paintbrush. It took me a while to learn her language. I never knew the real one, the symbols that twisted my head and made my bones ache. But then Mom introduced us to what was called, ‚ÄúThe water language,‚Äù derived from our ancestors. 

Mom said it was easy, as soon as I got used to it. 

‚ÄúIt's like talking underwater, sweetie,‚Äù she told me. 

It *was*. 

Each word was a trickling stream in my hand. 

So effortless. 

Water. 

Drip, drip, dripping. 

*Luhar*. 

*Nathur*. 

*Velilua*. 

Scrawled on their neck, then, would be our final plea for forgiveness, and our offering of a King to serve her. *‚ÄúLunakar Velix‚Äù*

Finally, sliced into their right palm: *Thalix*. 

To seal it‚Äì also known as a sacred binding. 

I watched Mom plunge a blade through Teo‚Äôs skull, her lips parting in a moan, her hands slick with his blood, beads of red dripping down his face as he choked for mercy. When Mom dragged his body into a bowing position, bathing him in the full moon‚Äôs light, I decided that I didn't *have* a mother anymore. 

‚ÄúMaybe they're right,‚Äù my brother whispered, when disappointment began to flicker on Mom‚Äôs face. Unsurprisingly, Teo‚Äôs brutal murder was for nothing. There was no outline to carve, and no light to drown each of us. 

Jonas let out a harsh laugh, cutting into the silence. I found my gaze glued to the other members waiting patiently for the moon to bless them. ‚ÄúMaybe they're onto something‚Äì and finding someone with an actual outline, and then skinning them, really will finally awaken our King and Queen.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù I gritted out. I didn't like the slight smile curving on his lips. 

The same shadow blooming behind his eyes that I saw in my mother‚Äôs. 

*‚ÄùIt's going to be okay, I promise,‚Äù* my voice splintered into a sob, and it was visceral enough to contort my present body into an arch, slamming me back down. The memory jumped. 

I sensed hands entangled with mine, narrow fingers grasping for an anchor, squeezing for dear life. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù* I whispered, and this time we were both older, his head buried in my chest, sobbing into my shirt. 

Clinging to the chains wrapped around his wrists, I pressed a kiss atop his head. 

‚ÄúI've got a month before the next full moon,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúMom is going to kill me.‚Äù

I pulled away, refusing to look my brother‚Äì now twenty years old‚Äì in the eye. 

‚ÄúThat's not going to happen,‚Äù I gritted out. 

Jonas pulled his knees to his chest, and I couldn't stop myself from ripping the crown from his head‚Ä¶ where it would stay until he stepped onto the altar. It was evil, made up of human bone from past sacrifices. 

‚ÄúThey need three vessels if they can't have you,‚Äù I started to pace his cell, slicing my fingers on the crown‚Äôs sharp prongs. I think somewhere along the way, spending my late teenagehood and early adulthood in a cult, part of me started to believe. 

I was already smiling, stretching my grin right across my face so I would believe my own delusion. When I was nineteen, we came so close. This time, we took three out of town freshman college kids. 

That was the first time I saw an outline, a shadow bound to the soul. Mom really did think we had done it‚Äì before the outlines we carved splintered into nothing, and the moon left us once again, like she was angry. I wasn't going to let that happen this time. ‚ÄúSo, if I find three worthy and pure outlines and bring them here, they'll let us go.‚Äù I caught myself, biting through a sob. 

I didn't *want* to betray her light. But I also didn't want to fucking *die*. That's how I knew the brainwashing had already ensnared part of me, and was taking an unyielding hold. I covered up the windows in my brother‚Äôs cell, blocking out the night. 

Then I poured all of his water out. 

Just in case she was listening. 

‚ÄúAnd Mom?‚Äù Jonas peered up at me with wide eyes that dared to be hopeful. 

I was aware I was crying, but my smile grew bigger. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre okay without Mom.‚Äù

Jonas nodded slowly, uncomfortably shifting in his chains. ‚ÄúOkay, so how are you going to get over the fence? It's guarded, like all night.  You'll get caught.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey use me as the poster child for recruiting students from my college classes,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI'll just say I've got some people interested.‚Äù I pulled out a screwed up piece of paper, holding it up. ‚ÄúMom talks about one of the last standing buildings in the town that was used for sacrifice. Bolivia House. It's a student house now, so it should be relatively easy.‚Äù

Jonas averted his gaze. 

‚ÄúSo, you're fine with killing three random students?‚Äù

His words twisted my stomach. 

For years, I had felt a constant weight on my shoulder dragging me down, pulling the breath from my lungs. Ever since our car crashed, and the Cult of Lumine welcomed us, I figured I was going to die. 

Alone, my body used as a vessel, with no family, and my own mother being the one to do it. I didn't know what a family was anymore. It wasn't what *we* were. Jonas was distant, his broken mind so easy to influence and mould. I could already see parts of him submitting to the moon‚Äôs spell. 

We didn't spend time together, locked in our rooms all night to pray to the moon. 

Mom barely spoke to us. In her eyes, we were not her children. Jonas and I were puppets. When we weren't praying, we were learning her language, and what would happen when she finally took over, taking away humanity's shadow once again. I lost myself somewhere between watching my first sacrifice, and then my fiftieth. But now there was hope.

I could get that family I dreamed of. Jonas and me, somewhere safe. I just had to throw away my humanity to finally be free. 

Kneeling in front of my brother and grasping for his hands, squeezing them tight, I truly believed in this future. I had to, for Jonas. ‚ÄúIf killing them saves us, then yes.‚Äù the words left my mouth, almost like I myself was speaking her language, like water dripping from my tongue. ‚ÄúI'll bring three outlines back here, and you and me‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll run.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to carve out their hearts first,‚Äù Jonas rolled his eyes, but a smile curled on his lips. It was progress. I wasn't a fan of his lecturing tone, but this was better than him giving in, sleeping all day and wearing that crown. He looked far more alert, even with the dark shadows underlining his eyes. ‚ÄúYou know what to do, right?‚Äù

I nodded, but my stomach twisted. ‚ÄúI've‚Ä¶ watched Mom do it enough times.‚Äù 

The memory warped into nothing, and I was left strangled by my own scream entangled with my younger self's voice.

I had a brother. 

I couldn't stop another screech clawing from my throat. 

This time, it was agonizing, crying out for him. 

Jonas. 

How did I forget my own brother? 

‚ÄúIt's okay, Nin,‚Äù a voice cut through the silence, entangling with my sharp pants. His voice was soothing, mimicking water, almost a melody. ‚ÄúIt's okay, I've got you.‚Äù

Rowan. 

All of me felt wrong, twisted and contorted, my arms dead weights beside me. But his low murmur was enough to choke the screams at the back of my throat, my screech for a brother I didn't remember.

I found my voice, raw and scratchy, spluttering blood. 

‚ÄúRowan,‚Äù I lost myself in sobs. I had a brother, I thought dizzily. I had a *brother.*

Did the moon take him away too? 

Something snapped inside me, my veins were on fire. When I lunged into a sitting position, I was violently yanked back by velcro straps pinning me to a  table. 

I could hear my housemate, but I couldn't *see* him. ‚ÄúRowan, get me out of here,‚Äù I whispered, my body in fight or flight. 

I tugged against the restraints, but they were still pinning me down. 

Rowan was nowhere to be seen, and yet his voice was so close, rooted in my skull. 

Bolivia House‚Äôs basement was lit up in candlelight. I could make out blurs of warm orange dancing in the dark. 

‚ÄúI *am*.‚Äù His voice dropped into his usual sour tone. I still couldn't see him, my gaze glued to one particular candle set up on the concrete steps. ‚ÄúJeez, Nin, give me a sec.‚Äù

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù I gritted out, swallowing a cry. 

‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù

Footsteps. 

Slow, like they were dragging themselves. I flinched when ice cold fingers tiptoed across my forehead. ‚ÄúI'm right here,‚Äù he  hummed. I could see his shadow looming over me, his face swamped in darkness. 

His fingers continued, tiptoeing down my face, my neck, and then to my bound wrists. I pulled at them again, ready to jump up. But I was still pinned down. 

And then I remembered what state I left Rowan Beck in. 

He tried to escape his fate as a King, and his head had been ripped off by Kaz Delacroix, now a brainwashed footsoldier. 

The cult-woman's final words were an order for my housemate to be re-educated. 

Maggots filled my throat, writhing in the back of my mouth. 

‚ÄúYou got free.‚Äù I said, pulling at my restraints. 

His footsteps quickened into a sort of dance, parading around my bed. ‚ÄúMm, sort of.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, untie me.‚Äù I spat. 

The silhouette paused in its manic dance, before I sensed him creep closer. So close, his breath on my face, his lips nibbling my ear. ‚ÄúFirst, I kindaaaa have a question.‚Äù

I had my own. 

‚ÄúWhere are Kaz and Imogen?‚Äù I demanded. 

‚ÄúThey're not here right nowwwwwww,‚Äù Rowan answered in a tone that was not him‚Äì it was cruel and methodical, and yet keeping his snark. ‚ÄúWould you like me to ask the question, or should we begin?‚Äù

‚ÄúBegin *what*?‚Äù

I flinched when he got too close again, his hair tickling my cheek. Rowan hung upside down, a shadow with no face. ‚ÄúYou know what's funny?‚Äù he murmured, blowing in my face. ‚ÄúShe showed me everything I wanted to see‚Äîmy first *actual* death.‚Äù

He laughed, and it wasn't his usual sarcastic chuckle, it was hysteria, like he was‚Ä¶ mad. I didn't have to see his face to know something had become undone in him, likely influenced by the  light inside his head. I could feel him vibrating with excitement, humming with adrenaline. 

I tried to pull away from him, only for his fingers to wrap around my ponytail, yanking my head back. I had to bite back a shriek when he forcibly turned my head towards a single beam of moonlight scorching my cheek. He chuckled, his lips finding my neck. ‚ÄúI only had *one* request in return.‚Äù

I didn't have to answer. He was already straightening up.

I caught the glint of silver wrapped around his fingers, following the beam of light that slowly revealed his identity, pulling my housemate from the shadows at last‚Äîor more accurately, a hollowed-out shell bearing his face. 

The King was finally wearing his crown, drenched in red, with ragged strips of clothing hanging from his mostly naked body and jagged bone adorning his curls. 

This time, the cutting prongs from the child's skull fit him perfectly, drawing beads of thick red that ran down his pallid skin. And somehow, it suited him.

Because Rowan wasn't human anymore.

I watched his skin undulate, twitching like it was alive. He had transformed. I could see old skin shedding, his bones still misshapen and wrong, shuddering under his weight.

The transformation into a beast had drained all the color, all of the lingering humanity he had so desperately clung to‚Äîit was gone. I could see the madness he'd been brought to: complete, unbridled insanity alive in every contortion of his expression, quirking lips, and bouncing eyebrows. 

Whatever had been done to him wasn‚Äôt like Kaz or Imogen who underwent simple brainwashing, influencing the mind to think like the cult. 

His energy was darker‚Äîhollowing out everything that he was. Whatever had stolen his mind was cruel and unforgiving, and it was evident in his sinister smile, his wide, and yet empty eyes. It was Rowan, but it was more of a mockery of him, a celestial King wearing my housemate's face with moonlit eyes that swallowed his pupils whole. 

When he tilted his head, his lips curled into a grin, revealing elongated teeth jutting from his gums. He leaned close, his breath tickling my lips. It was Her. Every part of him was Her.

His face splintered, eyes lit up, bleeding pure, scorching moonlight. 

""Zharal, xor, venith,"" Rowan murmured, each word trickling from his tongue, a melody entwining each syllable. 

She was right there, streaming from his mouth, her own language already filling his head.

I felt his fingertips, bleeding Her light, dance across the back of my skull before my body jolted, a raw screech ripping from my lips. I barely felt the knife go in, protruding through my skull. 

""Make her fucking *suffer*,"" Rowan translated, bursting into child-like giggles, like the moon herself was laughing. The world violently jerked, and I was crying, screeching, sobbing for mercy while the moon laughed from the sidelines, illuminating the skylight.

Each fractured beam carved a semi-circle of light across my face.

She was burning me alive, skinning away my flesh. The two of them were playing with me, fucking with me like I was their toy. I felt his fingers follow the intrusion, all the way through my splintered skull and straight into the meat of my brain. ""Who is Sam Fuller, Nee-nahhhh?"" Rowan said, dragging out my name in a mocking drawl.

I parted my lips to reply, to scream, to sob for my death, when he blew in my face. 

""Okay, no, wait, wait, wait!"" He laughed, his voice thundered, enveloped in Her‚Äîin whatever King status she had granted him. 

The candlelight flickered out, and I was left with his shadow bathed in Her glow. 

Rowan leaned in, wiggling his eyebrows. I could still feel his fingers, invasive and wrong, clawing the tangled words from my throat. ""I mean, who is Sam Fuller to you?""

His question took me off guard, an answer pouring from my lips. 

Before it could hit the sound barrier, however, something yanked me‚Ä¶ *back*. 

Rowan‚Äôs cruel smile blurred in and out of view. I could feel his fingers moving deeper, this time with purpose. This wasn't torture, I thought, dizzily. Rowan, or whatever had taken him over, had an end goal. ‚ÄúSam Fuller,‚Äù he repeated, and I found myself repeating his words. *Sam*. 

*Sam Fuller*.

‚ÄúWho is he to you, hmm? *Kraz thu xor viln thrali*?‚Äù His voice was a trap. 

Sweet and melodic, but I fell for it‚Äì and the language, now that he was prodding on my brain, forcing his way through my memories, it started to splinter into clarity, into words that were familiar, that felt like water cupped in my hands. 

So beautiful, yet agonizing. ‚ÄúWho is this child‚Ä¶ in truth?‚Äù

The ground fell beneath me, leaving me falling. 

Plunging. 

Down. 

Down. 

Down. 

Until I hit *light*. 

I was standing on Bolivia House‚Äôs doorstep, warm air grazing my cheeks.

In front of me stood a sandy-haired boy with wide eyes, dressed in a leather jacket and jeans. ‚ÄúUh, hey,‚Äù he said, holding up a hand in a wave. His accent was different‚ÄîAustralian. ‚ÄúI'm Kaz‚Äôs boyfriend, Sam,‚Äù he added, shifting uncomfortably. ‚ÄúI haven't seen him in a while, like since last Friday, and he's not replying to my texts‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's fine,‚Äù I said, smiling widely. Behind me, Charlie Delacroix was extremely close to toppling off of the chair he was strapped to, Rowan and Imogen muffling under duct-tape gags. 

Until this boy showed up, Kaz did everything I told him, nodding along and not acting like a child like the other two. He even listened to me try and give my reasons for doing this‚Äì that he was part of something beautiful, magical, and his sacrifice would paint the world in light. 

I thought he understood. I thought he *believed* me. 

Until his boyfriend showed up, and his expression turned feral, desperate. I had to gag him to stop the boy crying out. 

In the corner of my eye, Kaz was rocking back and forth on his chair, muffle screaming. I made sure to block the gap in the door. ‚ÄúHe's sick,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúIt's, like, super contagious, so you should probably leave.‚Äù

Sam didn't look convinced, and I half wondered if another outline would suffice. 

I was so close to saving myself, and Jonas. Just a few more days. 

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Sam cocked his head, his lips curling in distaste. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, *who* are you, again?‚Äù

*‚ÄúSam!‚Äù*

Rowan‚Äôs croak was unexpected, my skin prickling. I thought I gagged him. 

‚ÄúSam!‚Äù Rowan cried out, his voice stronger, and something in me snapped. ‚ÄúSam, you need to get help!‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs expression crumpled, and he bound forwards. 

‚ÄúRowan?‚Äù Sam stumbled forwards, and in my panic, I shoved him back. ‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù

I had zero choice.

Holding my breath, I politely told him to wait. I closed the door, twisted around, grabbed my gun, untied Rowan, and dragged him to the door‚Äînot before grabbing a jacket and throwing it over his shoulders to hide the markings I had sculpted into his flesh. 

Luhar, Nathur, Velilua ran down his right arm, while Lunakar Velix was clumsily cut into his palm. I found a pair of gloves and, ignoring his raised eyebrow, forced them onto his hands. I made sure to stick the revolver in his back, sliding it down the curve of his spine. I felt his shiver, muffling his shriek with my hand.

‚ÄúTalk to Sam,‚Äù I murmured in his ear, forcing him to turn around by the scruff of his shirt, gesturing to Kaz and Imogen. ‚ÄúIf you say anything, I will fucking kill them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you won't.‚Äù he muffled into my hand, meeting my gaze, his eyes challenging. 

He was right. I wasn't going to shoot them. So, I ran the barrel of the gun under his jacket, all the way up the flesh of his back, and into the back of his neck. 

Jonas‚Äôs survival pushed me to go one step further, teasing the trigger. 

This time, Rowan flinched, his expression hardening. 

I repeated my words, emphasising each one with a sharp prod. 

Talk. to. Sam. 

When he didn‚Äôt respond, panting into my palm, I dug the gun deeper.

‚ÄúNod if you understand.‚Äù

Rowan straightened up, brushing away my hand with a snort.

‚ÄúAye, aye, captain,‚Äù he breathed, before opening the door, fashioning a grin. I watched him, maybe with awe, my own heart aching. I wasn't expecting to fall in love with the vessels who were going to save my brother. Rowan was a natural, casually leaning against the door frame with his signature smile. ‚ÄúHey, suuuup, Sammy?‚Äù

Sam shot me a look, before focusing on Rowan. 

‚ÄúDude, what the fuck are you wearing?‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs words were directed at Rowan‚Äôs jacket slung over his bare torso.

Rowan didn't seem to notice himself, offering a shrug. 

‚ÄúI, uhhh, I couldn't be bothered getting dressed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ said you needed help,‚Äù Sam said, his voice breaking.

I caught the curl in Rowan‚Äôs lips, like he was going to cry out again. 

But he didn't. 

Rowan rolled his eyes, and his laugh was real and natural. He even nudged me, like I was part of them‚Äì like *I* was in their family. ‚ÄúI was fucking with you, Sammy! We‚Äôre all kiiiinda drunk right now, so don't take anything we say seriously, all right?‚Äù

He was a good actor. 

Part of me hated what I had become. In my desperation to find vessels for our mother, I hadn‚Äôt expected to grow close to the Bolivia House residents. 

I had spent the better half of my late teenage years trapped in a cult, and for the first time in so long, I knew what family dinners tasted like: veggie lasagna.

I knew what board game nights looked like‚Äîarguments over cereal, movie nights, and laughter. I knew the warmth of a bed, the boiling heat of a shower, and the comfort of people who cared about one another. I finally knew what it was like to have a *family*. 

It was only when Jonas called me, screaming that he was being put forth on the altar at the next full moon, that I felt myself snap altogether‚Äîcoming apart completely. But I couldn‚Äôt deny the feelings I had for the boy whose heart I was supposed to carve out. I did things I regretted but knew were necessary. 

I seduced Rowan Beck, leading him into my bed and drugging him before tying him to the others in the lounge. I followed my brother‚Äôs instructions, cutting Her words into his skin. I told him the language I had carved into his arms was beautiful, and I promised he would fall for Her, too. 

I prodded each symbol, still bleeding, sharp beads of red running down his skin. His blood was Her lifeforce. I told him that, drawing constellations inside the pooling scarlet, just like Mom taught me. 

But he just lurched back like he was scared of me, violently straining against the ropes tangled around his wrists. It was pathetic.

*He* was pathetic for actually falling for my ploy. 

But watching Rowan wear a mask so effortlessly, smiling through the agony I had carved into his skin, my heart mourned for what could have been.

Sam was quickly becoming a liability. He didn't believe Rowan's lies. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he  folded his arms. ‚ÄúSo, how about I talk to Kaz?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's‚Ä¶ sick.‚Äù Rowan pretended to cough. ‚ÄúCovid.‚Äù

Rowan had gone from a golden globe performance, to a CW actor. 

No. 

I caught his side-eye. This was calculating. This was fucking clever. 

His bad acting was on *purpose*. 

‚ÄúHe doesn't want to talk to you,‚Äù I spoke up, stabbing my gun harder into Rowan‚Äôs back. I heard the breath leave his lungs in a sharp gasp. He sent me a look, but I was still speaking, the words dripping from my mouth like puke. I was glad I'd gone through their phones, highlighting texts from loved ones. Sam and Kaz hadn't spoken in a week, and the last text Charlie Delacroix had sent was, *‚ÄúFuck off, Sam.‚Äù*

‚ÄúHe never wants to see you again.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúGet lost.‚Äù

I slammed the door on his face before he could reply. 

‚ÄúHarsh.‚Äù Rowan muttered, when I forced him onto his chair, tying his wrists together. 

Kaz muffled something, and I ripped off his tape.

‚ÄúWhat did you say to him?‚Äù he demanded in a hiss. 

‚ÄúI told him you never want to see him again,‚Äù I said, and his face fell. 

I had to swallow the growing lump in my throat.

Kaz ducked his head, and I refused to admit he was crying. 

I looked away, before I could choke on one tongue trying to apologize. 

""You're an evil bitch,"" Imogen whimpered as I replaced her gag with fresh tape.

""But it's true,"" I said, steeling my voice and avoiding Rowan's glare.

""When I offer you to the moon, you won't be coming back."" I loosened their restraints, guilt eating at me, as I stroked my fingers over the words I had carved into Imogen's neck, Kaz's shoulder, and Rowan's right arm.

When neither of them responded, I held up Imogen‚Äôs phone with a forced smile. 

‚ÄúNow. Who wants pizza?‚Äù

‚Äî

‚ÄúHey, Nin.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt expecting Kaz to speak, a few hours later. I thought he was asleep, dozing on Rowan‚Äôs shoulder. 

I thought they were talking to each other, which I couldn‚Äôt allow, but Rowan was asleep, his head bowed, his soft snores sending my heart into my throat. 

I wanted to untie his restraints, or at least loosen them. I *wanted* to let him shower, bring down fresh clothes from his room. 

I even found myself searching for ointment to soothe the markings in his arms. 

But helping them was one step closer to feeling empathy, and *empathy* would get my brother killed. I had known these people for too long, developing relationships and attachments that were never supposed to happen. 

Imogen Prairie had a heart of gold, which was her biggest flaw. 

She was too naive, immediately trusting me because I was from her classes.

Imogen was a lonely girl, dumped by her parents at the age of sixteen and forced to grow up way too young.

She should have been smart, should have known that I wasn't a good person. 

Imogen should have known not to trust everyone, and that doing so would get her hurt.

And yet, she welcomed me with a smile, not suspicious in the slightest.

Imogen Prairie was the perfect vessel. The real world would eat her *alive.*

Charlie Delacroix was the smart, level-headed one. The one I was keeping a close eye on. I was already mentally considering his vessel as one of three royals. Mom said that's what she was looking for.

However, as a human, he was *too* clever, and if given the opportunity, Kaz could easily come up with an escape plan. 

I had to give him points for being the least frustrating out of the three of them, though. While Imogen sobbed and screamed threats at me, and Rowan tried to channel his inner houdini, to topple the three of them over, Kaz stayed calm and collected, reassuring them with hushed murmurs that everything was going to be okay.

He may have had a cool demeanor, but when the boy did catch my eye, I saw the anger and resentment curled in his lip.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I cook us all a meal?‚Äù he suggested, and I couldn't resist a smile when just the mention of home cooked food jolted Rowan‚Äôs head of shaggy brown curls awake. ‚ÄúI mean, I *love* pizza, but not four times in a row.‚Äù 

Kaz gestured to his bindings. ‚ÄúIf you untie me, I promise, hand on heart, that I won‚Äôt try anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúI second that,‚Äù Rowan mumbled under his gag. ‚ÄúI can't eat anymore fucking garlic bread.‚Äù

I stood from my chair, slowly making my way over to the three of them and grabbing my gun from the coffee table. 

The weapon had always felt wrong in my hand, like it didn't fit. 

I caught Rowan‚Äôs eye, who twisted his head, his gaze glued to my gun. 

I wasn't expecting his lips to curve into the smallest of smiles under the duct-tape gag, like he knew something I didn't. Kaz didn‚Äôt look scared. His smile, when I tore off his gag, was genuine, and I hated that despite everything I had done to these kids, somehow they were still trying to be civil. ‚ÄúI can make us something home-cooked.‚Äù His smile broadened. ‚ÄúYou need us to stay healthy, right? For when you sacrifice us to your, uhh, your moon Goddess.‚Äù

He really was listening. I wasn't delusional. 

So he *had* paid attention when I was talking about how beautiful She was, how they were going to fall for Her too, and how my family wasn't bad‚Äîjust misunderstood orphans, sons and daughters of the sky. I didn't mention my desperation to escape. I had to keep a level head and act exactly like my mother. 

I told them of the 100 days and 100 nights of darkness, and the moon‚Äôs reign. 

Our ancestors, who could shift their flesh into beings of light.

Rowan‚Äôs eyes nearly lodged into the back of his head from excessive rolling, while Imogen remained pricklingly silent.

But Kaz? Kaz had listened.

Kaz was ready to accept her‚Äì and sacrifice himself for my brother. 

I really thought that, until I untied his bindings. Kaz stayed still, ducking his head. It was Rowan who dived to his feet‚Äîstumbling toward the door.

But not before I was two steps ahead of him, sticking the barrel of my gun into the back of his head. If he got away, Jonas was dead. I wouldn't be getting that happy ending with my family. But I couldn't breathe, and it wasn't fair that I was feeling... this. Why was I sweating? Why were my legs shaking?

""Sit down,"" I said through my teeth, willing myself to stop shaking. 

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

What I didn‚Äôt expect was how effortlessly the man twisted, disarming me in one swift movement, wrapping his arms around me. 

I was immediately taken off guard by his warmth, and now much I wanted it to be *real*. The gun fit in his hands as if it had always belonged there, his grip unnervingly perfect. Rowan ripped off his gag, wincing. He was panting, but, unbelievably, grinning wildly, almost feral.

His eyes challenged me to take a step further. ‚ÄúStay *back*.‚Äù He said cooley, wrapping his fingers around the handheld. I was surprised how well he knew one. 

‚ÄúBack in my freshman days, my frat spent half the summer shooting wooden pigeons out of trees,‚Äù he rolled his eyes, ‚Äúbecause *of course* they did.‚Äù 

Rowan reloaded the gun, his finger comfortably resting on the trigger, training the barrel between my brows. 

‚ÄúDon't move.‚Äù

He gestured to Kaz, jutting his chin. ‚ÄúIt's okay,‚Äù said, ‚ÄúI've got her.‚Äù

Behind me, Kaz, after hesitating, nodded, helping Imogen to her feet. 

Rowan told the two of them to stay back. 

Kaz reached for his phone I had kept on the coffee table, but Rowan shook his head.

‚ÄúNo cops,‚Äù he said, narrowing his eyes at me. ‚ÄúI want to talk to her.‚Äù

He took a step forward, and I instinctively took one back. 

Instead of shooting me, though, Rowan dropped the gun, kicking it under the door, and gestured to the dining table. ""Sit.‚Äù

I found my voice, glancing at Kaz and Imogen, who looked equally confused. When Imogen tried to lunge forward, Kaz gently dragged her back, murmuring to her. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I whispered. 

Rowan sighed, plonking himself down on the floor, crossing his legs.

‚ÄúFine. Sit on the floor with me.‚Äù

I did, slumping onto my knees, surprised to find the weight on my shoulders was lighter. 

After a moment, he shocked me with a laugh. ‚ÄúI was right,‚Äù he said, his lip quirking. ‚ÄúYou *are* in a fucking cult.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, lost somewhere between breaking down on the kitchen floor and spilling everything from my lips‚Äîour forced indoctrination into the cult, my mother‚Äôs brainwashing, and the promise to save my brother. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was hallucinating, but at some point, Imogen appeared by my side. She grasped my hands, entangling her fingers with mine. Half-delirious, I tried to scrub away the markings I had cut into her palm. She was so warm, letting me sob into her shoulder.

Kaz didn't speak, but he did make me hot tea.

He was hesitant at first, before crawling over to me, offering his hand. 

Three days later, I was in the back of Kaz‚Äôs car. 

Imogen was next to me, her arms wrapped around a shoebox. 

Kaz had a plan‚Äì sort of. 

The cult was expecting three human hearts for the preparation ceremony.

So, after a lot of digging (and weird looks), we had three pig hearts, ready for offering. 

Kaz said pig hearts resembled human hearts, so it should work‚Äì in theory. 

‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù Rowan said from the passenger seat. He didn't turn around, his gaze glued to the window, late afternoon sunlight setting strands of his hair alight. 

‚ÄúAll you need to do is dump the hearts, grab your brother, and run,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have the car ready.‚Äù he leaned back in his seat with a sigh. ‚ÄúIf you're right about the cops knowing about the cult and even helping the fucks, then we‚Äôre on our own.‚Äù

I directed Kaz to the rendezvous, the edge of Stix forest, where I'd be meeting Mom. 

Imogen handed me the box, and gave me an awkward hug. 

I didn't understand their willingness to forgive me. I felt myself melt into her, grateful for the warmth of her sweater‚Äì her flowery scent sending my heart into my throat. 

After everything I did to them, these three wanted to help me save my brother. 

‚ÄúCome *back*,‚Äù Imogen whispered into my shoulder. She didn't let go when I tried to pull back. ‚ÄúIf things seem weird, just run away.‚Äù

Rowan didn't speak, staying in the car. 

Kaz, leaning against the trunk, offered me a wonky smile, and a two fingered salute. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be right here.‚Äù",5,1732239113.0,u_Trash_Tia,0,1.0,False

1gww6g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gww6g0/ex_suggests_coffee_as_friends_after_i_broke_no/,Ex Suggests Coffee as Friends After I broke No Contact,"Long story short is basically the title. My ex and I broke up somewhat mutually roughly 3 months ago after a 3 year relationship.

We decided to go No Contact at least for a while and just see what the future holds. She did ask me on our final day, if she could congratulate me for my birthday which was in 3 weeks, she never did.

After 3 months, I was missing her so deeply that I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and decided to reach out. I tried keeping it light but touched on the regrets I have for the mistakes I made in the relationship, and offered to talk things through.

After the message, which got read in like 10 seconds, she didn‚Äôt reply for two weekends, until today where she said:

I don‚Äôt feel the need to talk things through, since I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs anything to talk about. I‚Äôm happy with how I feel now. I would be open to having a coffee, as friends. But there‚Äôll be no more than that from me, I don‚Äôt want to give you false hope.

This was obviously hard to receive, especially after two weeks when I finally started to get myself together a bit and accept her silence.

The real question I have is, if this is truly how she feels, why would she offer to go out for coffee still?  I‚Äôm super torn whether I should accept, on one hand, I‚Äôd love to, but I also want to respect her boundaries since I definitely would be hoping to rekindle. Not on the first round of coffee, but down the line. 

I‚Äôd like to add: she still Tweets a lot of sad break up stuff, and even mentioned she occasionally misses our memories. 

Would appreciate any response a lot. And would love to hear if people have made it work despite their ex initially being so confident about their choices. ",1,1732239040.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Since, I've come to realize everything reminds me of him. The TV shows I watch, the food I eat, even the weather. It's been raining the past few days, and it's supposed to keep going for a week. Chris loved the rain. He could never go out into it because my mom was always afraid he'd catch something. So I used to go out into it; I'd do anything he'd ask me to do in the rain, and as technology got better, I'd take my phone and record myself. 

Today, I slept for most of the waking day. Until dinner time, when my friend finally woke up. Now, I'm sitting in the rain sobbing, drinking coffee, and typing this out. The rapid thumb of the water against my umbrella is both soothing and distressing. I miss him so much. ",1,1732238919.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1gww4no,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gww4no/investing_in_what_you_know_modern_tools_for/,Investing in What You Know: Modern Tools for Finding Hidden Gems,"In 'One Up On Wall Street' (great book, highly recommend) Peter Lynch emphasizes the idea of ""investing in what you know"". Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn‚Äôt his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She‚Äôs the one who discovered L‚Äôeggs.‚Äù*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don‚Äôt live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street‚Äôs radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa‚Äîsurely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I‚Äôm curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven‚Äôt gone mainstream yet. I‚Äôve thought about using tools like Amazon's ‚Äútop rated‚Äù section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in. I also checked out¬†r/buyitforlife, but it‚Äôs not quite what I'm after.

Thoughts?

And please no ""put it all in VOO and come back in 80 years"". Yes most of my money is already in Index funds. This is an investing sub, and people should be interested in investment discussion, not just parroting the same old Bogleheads shit ad nauseam.",5,1732238885.0,investing,1,0.78,False

Craving something sweet with a touch of salty goodness? This **Salted Caramel Pound Cake** is pure indulgence! Rich, buttery layers swirled with caramel and topped with a decadent drizzle‚Äîit‚Äôs the dessert you didn‚Äôt know you needed.

# Ingredients

* **For the Cake:**
   * Cooking spray
   * 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
   * 1 cup granulated sugar
   * 4 large eggs
   * 2 cups all-purpose flour
   * 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 1 teaspoon kosher salt
   * 1/4 cup caramel sauce, plus more for topping
* **For Garnish:**
   * Flaky sea salt

# Directions

# Step 1: Prep Your Oven

Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a 9‚Äù x 5‚Äù loaf pan with cooking spray and set it aside.

# Step 2: Cream Butter and Sugar

In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together softened butter and sugar until it‚Äôs light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

# Step 3: Combine Dry Ingredients

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Slowly fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.

# Step 4: Create the Caramel Swirl

Scoop about 1/4 of the batter into a separate bowl and fold in the caramel sauce until evenly combined.

# Step 5: Layer and Swirl

Alternate spooning dollops of the plain and caramel batter into the prepared loaf pan. Insert a wooden skewer or knife into the batter and swirl it in a figure-eight pattern to create a marbled effect.

# Step 6: Bake

Bake for about 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then gently invert it onto a cooling rack to cool completely.

# Step 7: Add the Finishing Touches

Once the cake has cooled, drizzle it generously with caramel sauce and sprinkle flaky sea salt on top for that perfect sweet-and-salty combo.

# Time to Dig In!

Slice it up and serve this crowd-pleaser with a hot cup of coffee or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Trust me, it‚Äôs love at first bite.

I recently saved this Lane Acclaim coffee table from an estate sale and have embarked on refinishing it but have run into some issues. The previous owners let it get some very serious water damage that led to the edge/trim pieces to separate from the core of the table. At first I thought it could be fixed with just some clamps and glue but the plywood core has expanded, separated, and has chunks of wood falling out. All of this prevents from the tongue and groove edges on the trim and core from becoming flush no matter the amount of pressure. The middle legs have lost some of their structural integrity because the core in which they're attached to is separated on the underside.

There are two things I need to address -

1. Removing the edge pieces from the core to clean and reattach. Hopefully some of you can provide insight into this. There is a youtube video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1bV7\\\_hMAQE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1bV7%5C_hMAQE)) but he doesn't go into too much detail and I've not had luck with a heat gun and prying because of how damaged the core is.
2. Fixing the expansion (and subsequently lumpiness) of the core, especially in the middle by the legs.

Thank you! (crosspost with r/LaneAcclaimRescue)

Among other things,  I‚Äôm starting my intensive outpatient program on monday. Idk if it matters to my story, but I‚Äôm 28. I didn‚Äôt think this would be so extremely long, but I just wanted to write this out and to share this with someone. Please skip to the bottom if you want the TLDR. 

First, please let me share how this change came to be, after years of not learning a god damn thing:

I‚Äôve been trying to quit for the past few years, off and on success but it never stuck. I was most recently sober from July 17th to last Wednesday. 

Last Wednesday I was at a hockey game, invited by a vendor and in a suite with others in our industry, and unfortunately my boss as well. Everyone was drinking and having a good time, I figured I‚Äôve been sober like 6 months, I can have a beer with them. Then some Jack Daniel‚Äôs, because sure, I don‚Äôt even feel buzzed. Now, this is already an issue personally because I drank again, but it would have been fine except for one thing: I started taking Wellbutrin in July, and was/am at 300mg daily. So I‚Äôm only a light beer and a single shot of whiskey deep (that‚Äôs like nothing for me), and completely sober aware lucid etc, mid conversation with a woman and then BAM I‚Äôm home in bed. 

I‚Äôve blacked out a couple times in my younger years (I‚Äôm 28 now) and I know what they‚Äôre like. I‚Äôve never had a complete and sudden wipe of memory like that, never gone from sober to suddenly home with zero memory beyond where it cut off suddenly. Fucking scared the shit out of me, and I thought did I get roofied? What happened after my memory suddenly cut off? Did I drive??

So I texted the vendor who brought me to ask what happened, and he said my boss had to call me an Uber and help me into it. WTF. Now I‚Äôm panicking, and once it‚Äôs 8:00am I text my boss to say I heard you called me an Uber, I‚Äôm so sorry, what happened? She says ‚ÄúIt was bad (my name), come into the office on Monday and we‚Äôll have a talk with (name of the other senior vp who is the company attorney)‚Äù.

So I‚Äôm fucked, my career is fucked, I ruined some vendor relations and they‚Äôll talk and my reputation is now fucked in the whole industry. I‚Äôll have to move to another state to restart again. These were some of my thoughts, and in this mindset I bought a bottle of vodka, and I drank a liter a day, huge gaps in memory now, continuing until Sunday around noon when suddenly my parents show up extremely concerned. I‚Äôm like WTF are you doing here? They say my GF got so concerned from our phone calls that she thought I was going to kill myself and called my parents. 

I‚Äôm mortified, but willingly go with them to the hospital, which I thought would entail the usual triage and then send me home with Librium to sort myself out like I did when I took myself in July. (Side note, this 6 month stretch was the longest I‚Äôve had because in July I decided to do it myself, called and Uber and walked into the ER, totally lucid and just asking for help to detox. They thought I was only slightly drunk and everyone was all chatty and no concerns. Turns out I had BAC of 422. Well THAT scared the fuck out of me and this the longest streak) 

This time wasn‚Äôt like that. Because of my documented history with them my current presentation this time was very concerning to the drs. The major memory gaps and my behavior they were all concerned and even gave me a ct scan. I was just drunk and on medication you can‚Äôt drink on. This time BAC 380. 

So now it‚Äôs been hours and hours and I‚Äôm in beginning withdrawals and REALLY wanted to leave (which was always an option). Instead, because of the concern I could see I caused my family and loved ones, that they thought they would find me dead in my room, I voluntarily went to a detox facility. This was unlike any self detox I‚Äôve ever done, this wasn‚Äôt a wean off it, or a Librium and at home detox, this was a cold turkey from 1liter vodka/day to suddenly handcuffed to a radiator until I dried out kinda detox. It was hell. 

This place was a nightmare, fucking ex cons in there saying it‚Äôs worse than prison. Strip searched, pulled my ass cheeks apart and everything. Had zero items allowed, not even clothing, instead it was like prison attire (but worse according to the dudes in there that I talked to who have been in prison). I had absolutely nothing to do, couldn‚Äôt even go outside to sit in the sun, just confined to my shared room or the small common room. No coffee (no caffeine), no nicotine, no electronics , no shoes, no anything that could possibly be used to kill yourself. But I did have unlimited access to jello, which honestly beat the hell out of the ‚Äùfood‚Äù they served three times a day.  Not that I ever touched one. I went the entire time only drinking some milk to settle my stomach, otherwise didn‚Äôt eat. So many other bad things, but I‚Äôm going on way too long. 

I laid on that bed watching the clock (the only thing to do) for two and 1/2 agonizing days, counting every second, wanting more than anything to leave (which I could do, I was voluntarily committed). But I stuck it out until the DR discharged me. I had refused meds the whole prior agonizing day so that he would give me the green light, and he did. Hallelujah. 

Now what? Back to my regular routine and facing the fallout of my job and career? Just going until I relapse again and do actually drink myself to death? No. I saw the harm I caused my loved ones this time, and I took a hard look in the mirror this time. I had nothing but time to think in there, and I‚Äôd made up my mind: I wanted my true self back, my life back, the me that died years ago when I became consumed by alcohol. 

So, that same afternoon I was released I went though a very very frustrating process with insurance and tons of calling around to places and people, and I went to a smart recovery meeting, I scheduled therapy for this morning (day 4), I had dinner with my family that night I got out, to show them I was ok and to try to make things right for the worry and pain I caused them. 

Day three, yesterday/day after release, I made a plan. I started taking Naltrexone with the intention of getting the shot in 30 days. I attended a meeting. I went for a 4 mile walk. I got my house in order, handled what I could with work to make it easier for them to take over all my accounts and then handed in my laptop. I requested 30 days FMLA. 

Today, I attended my therapy session and was extremely lucky and happy to find that I think they can actually help me. I‚Äôll be seeing them weekly. Therapists I‚Äôve experienced before have all not been any help, but this one is different. That gave me more motivation. This afternoon I attended another meeting. I have two more scheduled for tomorrow. 

Finally, on Monday I begin a 4 week intensive out patient program. I‚Äôm doing every fucking thing possible to change. I can‚Äôt live like this, I can‚Äôt let my family watch their son/brother die a slow suicide by drinking. I want my fucking life back, I want to be the me that died those years ago. 

TLDR:
After years of attempting sobriety with some off and on success, but making zero changes to my life or mind,  I‚Äôm finally doing it. I‚Äôm doing it all, whatever it takes. Everything else be damned. I will not let my loved ones watch me die a slow death right in front of them, powerless to stop me. I will kill the man I am now and grow into the man I was, the man I‚Äôm supposed to be. 

To anyone who read my novella (lol), thank you, truly. I will not drink with you today. ",8,1732237978.0,stopdrinking,2,0.91,False

1gwvssl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaneAcclaimRescue/comments/1gwvssl/coffee_table_refinishing_need_advice_on_removing/,Coffee Table Refinishing - Need Advice on Removing Trim and Fixing Water Damaged Plywood,"Hello!

I recently saved this Lane Acclaim coffee table from an estate sale last weekend and have embarked on refinishing it but have run into some issues. The previous owners let it get some very serious water damage that led to the edge/trim pieces to separate from the core of the table. At first I thought it could be fixed with just some clamps and glue but the plywood core has expanded, separated, and has chunks of wood falling out. All of this prevents from the tongue and groove edges on the trim and core from coming flush no matter the amount of pressure. The middle legs have lost some of their structural integrity because the core in which they're attached to is separated on the underside.

There are two things I need to address -

1. Removing the edge pieces from the core to clean and reattach. Hopefully some of you can provide insight into this. There is a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1bV7\_hMAQE) but he doesn't go into too much detail and I've not had luck with a heat gun and prying because of how damaged the core is.
2. Fixing the expansion (and subsequently lumpiness) of the core, especially in the middle by the legs.

Thank you all!

 Fueled by 5hrs of sleep, a Kirkland breakfast sandwich, a cup of coffee, and approximately 10oz of water I set off with a roughly 50lb pack and the original intent of only doing 3 miles at 10:30. At 1.5 miles and taking small sips of water every 100 paces, I felt pretty good so I trucked on. At the turn around point, my hands started swelling a bit but nothing too crazy. I realized at around 3 miles in that I felt great so I picked up my pace from 15ish min to 12-14 and finished out the ruck.

 I completed my squats in sets of 10, drank a bit of cold water, took a quick bathroom break, and headed off on the run portion. Starting off at a 10ish min pace, I felt light on my feet and thought I could hold that pace forever. Boy was I wrong. About a mile it all went to shit. Everything hurt, I noticed i wasn't sweating, my hands were tingly, and my calves were TIGHT but even though momma didn't raise no bitch, she sure sure raised an idiot because I decided to commit and finish out the 5 miles. At one point my HR was 205 and I found the nearest shade to rest for 5min to let my HR settle back down into the 140 range before continuing. I jogged any downhill sections and walked even the slightest of inclines until I finished. By the time I finished the run, I had to leave to take care of family stuff so I didn't do the pushups. 

Temp was 80s and sunny. Again, time was around noon. Overall time was around 2hr 30min.

25m 175lbs 5'9"" Broke rule 1 by wearing PT clothes instead of boots and pants for the ruck. Dirty trail so dirty feet.

Lessons learned: Don't fuck around. Sleep better, hydrate better, eat better, plan workouts for more optimal times, adequately prepare before doing anything crazy. Really focus on Z2 running regardless of how boring and how slow I am right now until I've reached a baseline.

I think as a beginner the best machine for me is the vertuo coffee machine as it is small and compact‚Ä¶however they don‚Äôt do it in the light grey like the Vertuo Next Coffee Machine which is the colour I want

Does anyone know if they will bring new colours or grey in the vertuo coffee machine? 

I hope this makes sense‚Ä¶lol ",0,1732236914.0,nespresso,0,0.5,False
