My current method:
Im using the method prescribed by Lance Hedrick where he recommends to get a finer grind and use a filter on the plunger and slowly push it down. I use 12 grams per 200ml of water with a total brew time of 10mins.
I was using this dose and brew time with the James Hoffman prescribed method and it wasn't any different in the fruity notes department.

As mentioned it's very difficult for me to describe this taste because I haven't tasted anything like it before. Im not using milk and I tried dialing my process like mentioned above with Atitkan estate and Silver Oak but no matter how I do it, I can only taste something like old instant coffee without its bitter notes. 

My confusion is why can't I taste any of the fruity ot sweet notes at all, because even if I'm messing anything like grind size, brew time, dosing, water quality, I still should get some amount of fruity and some other bitter or acidic notes.

1ic7u07,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ic7u07/long_story_the_time_i_tried_to_help_ana_ingham/,Long Story: The Time I Tried to Help Ana Ingham,"They say no good deed goes unpunished, and never has that clich√© felt so true as it did when I crossed paths with Ana Ingham in a London caf√©. What began as a simple act of kindness quickly spiraled into two maddening days of frustration, disorganization, and unearned grievances. Four months later, I‚Äôm still paying the price for saying yes to her.

This is the story of how I wasted my time, energy, and patience trying to help someone who didn‚Äôt deserve it.

**The Setup: A Random Encounter at a London Caf√©**

I visit London often‚Äîmy boyfriend has an office here, so I tag along. We usually stay in Waterloo, near Lower Marsh with its bustling restaurants and artsy caf√©s. It‚Äôs a great place to get work done, and on this particular trip in September 2024, I chose a caf√© called *The Glitch.* It‚Äôs small, cozy, and supports the arts, donating 4% of its earnings to creative causes.

I was in my zone that day: AirPods in, Adderall kicking in, my MacBook humming with client work and an exciting new project. That‚Äôs when I noticed an elderly woman with a cane slowly making her way to the bathroom. On her way back, she stopped at my table and leaned in to talk.

Her name was Ana Ingham.

**The Ask: ‚ÄúCan You Help Me?‚Äù**

Ana explained that she was a screenwriter and needed help organizing her laptop files. She‚Äôd noticed I was working on a Mac and asked if I could show her how to tidy things up. No problem, I thought‚Äîit sounded like a quick, 10-minute favor.

She returned with her MacBook Air‚Äîan older model coated in crumbs and dried coffee, far too dirty for any laptop. I started organizing her files and quickly realized how chaotic her desktop was.

As I worked, she began telling me about her career, claiming to have written numerous screenplays, won ‚Äúdozens and dozens‚Äù of awards, and dreamed of compiling them into a book titled *‚ÄúMy Award-Winning Screenplays‚Äù by Ana Ingham.*

She asked if I could help format and publish her book on Amazon, offering to pay me ¬£400 for the project. Her original vision was a hard copy book, but after reviewing the sheer amount of material‚Äîthousands of pages if all her awards and scripts were included‚ÄîI realized it would be expensive and impractical. I suggested a more efficient and professional alternative: an eBook that included the screenplay titles, summaries, and related awards. Formatting that for Amazon would take time, but it was doable.

To make it producer-friendly, I proposed adding outbound links to the screenplays themselves (or leaving that optional, depending on her preference). She liked the idea but remained hesitant about the details. But, to her earlier admission‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt tech-savvy and wouldn‚Äôt have known to suggest these formats.

At the time, I thought it was manageable, and with a couple of free days in London, I began to help.

But ‚Äústraightforward‚Äù couldn‚Äôt have been further from the truth.

**The Reality: Chaos Unveiled**

It didn‚Äôt take long to realize Ana‚Äôs projects were far more disorganized than she‚Äôd let on. Her screenplays were riddled with typos and formatting issues, scattered across various folders, and often listed under multiple, inconsistent titles. Worse, her ‚Äúdozens of awards‚Äù were scribbled on a scrap of paper she handed me, sporadically springing from her memory, with no coherent list or proof.

While the end game was an eBook with screenplay summaries, a list of awards, and outbound links to the scripts, putting the information together was a major challenge.

As I worked, she kept disrupting me with, ‚ÄúDid you read that one?‚Äù (uh, her unknown script‚Ä¶ no). She also kept remembering additional awards‚Äî‚ÄúDo you have this one? What about that one?‚Äù‚Äîand her disorganization became increasingly clear. There was no central source of truth. Instead, I was stuck piecing together fragments of information from her chaotic files.

Four hours into this mess, she finally mentioned having a FilmFreeway account where all her awards were supposedly listed. Wow, seriously? That‚Äôs great, but telling me about that 4 hours prior would have been helpful.

**The FilmFreeway Debacle**

FilmFreeway‚Äôs interface was clunky, and filtering through her awards felt like untangling a hundred wires. Worse, many of the festivals she‚Äôd ‚Äúwon‚Äù seemed dubious. Their websites were broken or nonexistent, judging processes were unclear, and some festivals appeared to exist solely to collect submission fees.

Weeks later, I emailed FilmFreeway to share my concerns. Their response confirmed my suspicions: while they vet festivals initially, some turn out to be scams or inactive over time. It became clear that Ana‚Äôs ‚Äúawards‚Äù were more a product of this predatory business model than genuine recognition.

**Day Two: The Breaking Point**

We agreed to meet again at 10 a.m. the next day. I arrived early to continue cleaning up her scripts after spending hours the night before doing the same in my hotel.

Ana‚Äôs indecision was starting to wear on me. She now wanted to shop her scripts individually rather than include them in the eBook. To save her time and money, I suggested creating a polished one-page document listing her screenplay titles, awards, and a QR code linking to the eBook. She liked the idea, and I created it for her. While still maintaining that her Amazon eBook was possible, just not in the interest of time. I was willing to do it once I left. Time was not on my side given the scope and disarray of this project.

By now, I‚Äôd done hours of work, but things reached an awkward level when Ana asked me to step outside and supervised me deleting her screenplay files from my laptop. The implication was that I was going to do something with them. Let me tell you‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing that should be done with those. Permanent deletion is the ideal solution.

**The Payment Ordeal**

When it was time to settle payment, I created a QuickBooks invoice, only to discover I wasn‚Äôt set up for international payments. At Ana‚Äôs suggestion, we walked‚Äîvery slowly‚Äîto a nearby ATM, which was broken. Then to a second one, which was also out of service. I believe that she was genuinely trying to pay at that point.¬†

Finally, we sat down at a restaurant to try PayPal. Ana kept entering her card details, but every transaction was declined. I soon realized she was intentionally using the wrong address to ensure the payments wouldn‚Äôt go through.

I was completely over it. I had dinner plans, I had a headache, and it was clear this was a lost cause. Fed up, I helped her down the steps of the restaurant and calmly said I didn‚Äôt know what else to do and walked away. I chalked it up to a hard-learned lesson: never take on disorganized clients, no matter how sympathetic their story seems at first. It was over and in the past

.**The Aftermath: Insults and Theft**

The next morning, I woke up for an early flight to a Facebook message from Ana. She complained about the work, said she had ‚Äúwarned me‚Äù against using AI (I created a custom GPT - a repository of her work to draw summaries from and to glean awards since she hadn‚Äôt revealed there was a spot online), and claimed she‚Äôd only pay half the agreed amount‚Äîa moot point since she hadn‚Äôt paid anything at all. It set me off, and a full war of words ensued.

She is the ‚Äúso-called‚Äù acclaimed writer, but I assure you, my pen and my tongue are sharper.

Funny thing is‚Äîlater that week, I saw her posting the very awards summary and graphic I‚Äôd created for her on social media. My work was apparently good enough to flaunt but not worth paying for.

The clincher, and the reason I‚Äôm writing this, is that four months later, she resurfaced, posting on Facebook that I‚Äôd compromised her Celtx account‚Äîa ridiculous accusation. (I had to look up what that even was‚Äîonline screenwriting software.) I commented under a pseudonym, saying there‚Äôs no connection between airdropped files (too large to email because her Mac‚Äôs memory was full) and this account she was worried about. By morning, the post was deleted. Sharp pen.

**Reflections: Lessons Learned**

Looking back, this experience taught me several hard truths:

**Boundaries matter.** It‚Äôs okay to say no, especially when someone‚Äôs chaos threatens your own sanity.

**Do your homework.** If someone claims to have ‚Äúdozens of awards,‚Äù take it with a grain of salt until you see proof.

**Beware of emotional manipulation.** Ana‚Äôs sob story made me want to help, but it was a one-way street.

If someone claims no one has ever helped them before, HUGE red flag.¬†

Ultimately, this wasn‚Äôt about the ¬£400. It was about time wasted, mounting frustration, and being taken advantage of by someone incredibly unreasonable and infuriating.¬†

To this day, my blood boils when I think about how this ridiculous woman wandered up to a pre-occupied stranger and selfishly assumed I had nothing better to do and should drop everything to help her, as if my time and energy were meaningless. And then there‚Äôs the telling detail: she‚Äôs the type of person who follows no one on Facebook‚Äîa small but significant indicator of the one-way street that defines her interactions. It speaks volumes about her self-absorption.

She strikes me as the quintessential ‚Äúwoe-is-me‚Äù artist‚Äîsomeone who bemoans being overlooked and laments not achieving the success she believes she deserves, yet is completely devoid of self-awareness. Instead of recognizing her own role in her stagnation, she clings to a narrative of unfairness, blind to her chaotic habits and disorganization. She‚Äôs utterly out of touch, a selfish, narcissistic artist who sees everyone else as tools to fuel her vision while offering nothing in return.

She‚Äôs lonely, and sadly, it will stay that way.

To anyone reading this: don‚Äôt let an 84-year-old woman with a cane and a sob story fool you into thinking she‚Äôs harmless.

1ic7kq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ic7kq0/focusing_when_you_need_is_easy_actually/,"Focusing when you need is easy, actually.","The basics that nobody does but thats also the reason why they cant stick with their plans:

* Switched my phone to a dumb alarm clock. First 2 hours of the day are now phone-free. Brutal at first but my morning brain fog disappeared. im using LeechBlock to auto-block distracting sites during these hours so that it blocks and it reminds me why i blocked 
* Moved my phone to a different room during work. The ""I need it for emergencies"" excuse is a HUGEEE BS - if someone's dying they can call twice and my phone will ring anyway
* Started productivity sprints - 45 min of deep work, followed by actual breaks (not just switching to shorts or reels). Been tracking study with peazehub and my study consistency is way better. The key is protecting those 45 min like your life depends on it
* Killed the ambient noise. Got noise-canceling headphones and my focus jumped immediately. Our brains hate background chaos

The Weird Stuff That Worked:

* Context switching detox - picked one task and refused to switch for 2 hours straight. First week was torture but it retrained my attention span
* Got a sunlight alarm + red light for evenings. Fixed my circadian rhythm which apparently was destroying my focus
* Made a ""focus playlist"" with only instrumentals I've heard 100+ times. New music kills focus, familiar tracks boost it. Lo-fi beats are overrated - find what actually works for YOU
* Started ending work with a ""brain dump"" - list everything incomplete so your mind stops obsessing about it overnight. Keep a notes app or paper just for this

Physical changes that helped:

* Fixed forward head posture (tech neck). Headaches and brain fog dropped by like 70%. Get a laptop stand and proper chair, your neck will thank you
* Swapped afternoon coffee for electrolytes. No more 3pm crashes. The caffeine timing was messing with my sleep which destroyed next day's focus
* Added magnesium before bed. Sleep quality doubled = better focus next day. Not all magnesium is same - get the good stuff (magnesium glycinate)
* Got computer glasses even though my vision is fine. Eye strain was killing my attention span. Blue light isn't the enemy, eye strain is

Way to kinda change your mindset which is very important:

* More walking meetings, less Zoom. Movement while thinking = clearer thoughts. Your brain works better when your body moves
* Embraced ""productive procrastination"" - keep a list of small useful tasks for when focus dies. Better than scrolling Twitter
* Started using paper for planning. Digital tools are great but something about writing clicks different. Brain processes better on paper
* White noise instead of music sometimes. Feels weird but works better for complex tasks. Rain sounds are elite for this

Environment stuff:

* Changed room layout so I don't face any distractions. Facing a blank wall sounds depressing but it's incredible for focus
* Got a dedicated work lamp. Different lighting = different brain mode. Your brain learns the association
* Keep room slightly cool. Warm = sleepy = no focus
* Plants help somehow. Maybe it's the extra oxygen, maybe it's placebo. Don't care, it works

Sleep Upgrades That Actually Matter (no good sleep = shitty day)

* Blackout curtains changed my sleep quality more than any sleep hack
* No screens 30 min before bed. Read paper books instead
* Fixed mouth breathing at night (mouth tape). Sleep quality shot up
* Consistent wake time > consistent bed time. Your body craves the routine

Bonus Tips That Sound Dumb But just trust me 

* Stand up every 30 min minimum. Blood flow = brain power
* Use focus-music sites instead of Spotify (less distracting)
* Keep water at desk but use a bottle with a straw. Sounds dumb but you drink more naturally
* Chew gum for hard tasks. Increases blood flow to brain or something
* Set timers for everything. Time blindness is real
* Clean desk = clean mind. Take 2 min to reset between sessions



The point isn't to do everything here - pick 2-3 that sound doable and build from there. Your brain will thank you. Start small, be consistent, and watch your focus rebuild itself.

# Things to Carry

* Buy STC sim (best network), don't buy at the airport, buy at the shops near Mecca/Madina (\~40 SAR for 2 weeks)
* Carry plenty of moisturizer for your feet (as men will walk barefoot in Mecca).
* Carry 2x ankle socks for women (I recommend **Asics ventilated running socks**).
* When drinking water from Zamzam, make sure to drink from the container marked ""NOT COLD.""
* Coughing is common among people here; protect yourself and avoid drinking cold water.
* Be prepared with medicines for coughing, throat, and cold issues.
* Carry masks.
* Carry neck covers.
* Carry all kinds of essential medicines.
* Portable slippers or barefoot shoes (foldable).
* Apple AirTag (helpful for finding people during Tawaf).
* Visa cards often have issues in most Saudi shops. Make sure you carry one Mastercard. You can also apply for a **Maada card** from the Nusuk app, load it with balance, and use it.
* Be aware of the luggage size guidelines for the **Haramain bullet train**.
* Carry knee braces (helpful for pain recovery when used with balm).
* **Dates to buy** (prices vary based on size; try to purchase in Madina as it‚Äôs cheaper and of good quality):
   * Majdool: 25‚Äì35 SAR max
   * Ambar: 35 SAR
   * Ajwa: 25‚Äì35 SAR max
   * Sukhri: 10 SAR max
* Many people prefer drinking only Zamzam water. You can either buy a good portable 5L BPA-free bag or a blue plastic bag directly there for 2 SAR if convenience matters less to you.
* You can fill Zamzam water, although it is not allowed, and water boys may try to stop you. Whenever you get a chance, fill it discreetly.
* Use apps like Uber for taxis and HungerStation for food orders.
* Carry shoe covers.
* Carry a portable, lightweight bag.
* Carabiners (if you want to hang something).
* A 5-in-1 Universal Travel Adapter.
* **FAST&UP Reload O.R.S Electrolyte Tablets**.
* A foldable, lightweight carpet mat (useful for sitting anywhere and praying).
* Book your Rawdah appointment before going to Madina; appointments usually open after 4:30 PM IST, so keep checking.
* Carry a small scissor for cutting hair after **Safa-Marwa**, or for men, find a 30-degree barber shop for Halq (20 SAR).
* Get Zamzam water at the airport counter when you arrive. There‚Äôs a counter outside the airport where it costs 11 SAR per bottle (one bottle per passport).
* Avoid Al-Baik. It‚Äôs overrated and super crowded in tourist areas, though good for a budget and quick bites.
* Always negotiate prices up to 50% in shops. Saudi shopkeepers can be slightly aggressive during bargaining; just ignore their words and move to another shop.

# Madina

* **Rawdah Appointment**: When you go for the Rawdah appointment, they will first take you to a hallway where you will wait for 30 minutes. After that, they will guide you to the Riyazul Jannah area. The trick is to move as quickly as possible when your group is called, so you can reach the innermost area. People are usually removed from the back, so being at the front gives you more time.
* It‚Äôs cold in Madina; carry thermals or a jacket.
* **Jannat-ul-Baqi (graveyard)** opens after Fajr and Asr prayers.
* You‚Äôll find instant Rawdah slots when near Masjid-e-Nabawi. Keep checking hourly; I got 3x slots in a week.
* Ziyarat (\~3 hours): Don‚Äôt pay more than 250 SAR. Guides may rush you, but try to delay if you want to spend more time at specific places.
* Madina has lots of Careem bicycles. You can buy a day pass for 29 SAR to explore the streets. Visit **Quba Masjid** from Masjid-e-Nabawi via a beautiful 5km route (one side): [Map Link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qsqyf7v7Ey7xTgqc9).
* Spend time after Fajr at **Mosque of Al-Ghamama**: [Map Link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGGFEwi4EXkPoCLeA). It‚Äôs beautiful there.
* **Cheap and Best Shopping Spots**:
   * [Map Link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qYZKeMgct7pzhtDj6) (Take the escalator towards the tunnel inside; you‚Äôll find all the cheap and best shops offering items for 1, 2, 3, 5, 15, and 20 SAR).
* **Cafe**: [Map Link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mtAKF6k26KDQ3BXr5). (ROW COFFEE)

# Mecca

* Be cautious during Tawaf; people can be aggressive, squeeze you, and push. To avoid this, perform Tawaf from the upper floor.
* **Ayesha Masjid** round trip (Miqat point) costs \~40‚Äì50 SAR. Get dropped at the Clock Tower tunnel near Al-Haram Mosque (easier access to Kaaba from King Fahad Gate for Tawaf).
* **H1 Van Costs**:
   * To Jeddah Airport: \~200 SAR (7-seater), \~150 SAR (5-seater).
   * To Madina: \~450 SAR (7-seater), \~300 SAR (5-seater).
* **Shopping**:
   * Best shopping at Ibrahim Khalil Road and underground at Clock Towers. Many women sell items after prayers at Ibrahim Khalil for up to 50% cheaper.
   * **Cheap and Best Shopping Spots**:

Vet Exam Notes

Dog displayed sociability with all handlers by coming over for affection with a loose body and wagging tail. Dog was able to co
exist with both male and female dogs that provide appropriate space. He spent some time laying in the play yard corner just watching all the other dogs. Dog was easy to walk and return to kennel.

Hello! My name is Bruce and today I went on a Shelter Paws!  First stop was coffee! While my chaperones enjoyed sipping on their drinks, I LOVED my pup cup! We explored the Pearl where
I did all my business outside today. While I'm calm and laid back, I'm kind of nervous at first too...It takes time for me to warm up, but I did with my chaperones today! They even saw my tail wag after a bit.  My chaperones want you to know that I loved taking treats (of course!), sniffing all the grassy areas, and loud noises can be scary sometimes. I'm ready for a home of my own to decompress and have my own family to teach me how to love and be loved!
Come meet me today!

Maybe it's a cold rainy day and I burst into a coffee shop, soaking wet and shivering. I take a few seconds for myself to catch my breath before heading in. I'm immediately blasted by the warm air and the scent of coffee and flour, hearing the chit chats of the people and seeing the warm yellow tone glow of the lights. I glance around and noticed it's fairly empty today, my eyes scan the room until they land on the barista. A woman who appears to be my age, slightly smiling but visibly tired from a long day. She seems to be deep in thought at the current moment, her mind racing with dances and dreams, just like mine. As I approach the counter she looks up and smirks, observing my distaper of an appearance, saying ""that bad outside huh"". I chuckle lightly and say sarcasticslly ""oh this is nothing, just you wait till April, that's really when the floods really start."" She's knows I'm joking and tells me her name. I say mine and we exchange a few more sentences. Eventually she asked if I'd like to order anything, I nod and order a hot chocolate. She claims thats and unusual order, i chuckle again and shrug it off, participing in her banter.

Then I'll go find a seat, maybe near the fireplace, or an empty table, I'll crack out my laptop and start typing away. Crafting countless stories in my head, imagine worlds where anything can happen. I keep at that until my names called and my drink is handed off to me with a warm smile from that barista before.

I keep tryping and imagining until someone comes up to me. It's her again. She says she's on a break and asks if she can sit with me. I, of course, agree. We then sit, talking nonstop for 15 minutes that feels like a lifetime. She tells me the cafe is closing soon and if I wait around until then we could go explore this quite little town. I say ""that'd be lovely, although we might have to wait for the rain to slow down."" She smiles and says ""there's nothing wrong with getting a little wet.""

And before I know it I'm dragged outside in the pouring rain, my hand in hers, running away from the world. We run through the streets, laughing with tears forming in our eyes from the rain and winds. It's darker now, as we race by the town we see the flashes and streaks of the fairy lights strung around. She looks gorgeous. Even with the rain and wind crashing against her face. I see in her eyes she feels the same about me. I hear a sting from a violin and turn my head around, seeing a live band playing for a festival. The event is covered by a crowded tent with glass windows, separating the rain from the party. We glace to each other and rush over as fast as we can. We crash through the doors and take a beat to shake the rain away. The music swells in a gracious score and we rush twords the from to dance. I take the lead with a waltz and she follows suit. seeming shocked but catching on quickly and laughing nonstop. The music fades and time slows down, I'm no longer wet and cold. I'm looking into her eyes as she looks at mine. Observing every little thing about her. Her hair, her eyes, her lips. Every little thing, important and not. I look inside myself and find feel...Home.

we dance for hours until we can barely breath, we collaps on a table and catch our breath. A bartender comes over and asks for our orders. We look at each other again and laugh, I order a sherley temple, and she, a coffee, surprisingly enough. The bartender's confused by our outlandish choices of beverages, but we don't care. We drink, and laugh, and talk, until we collapse from exhaustion.

We make our way back to the cafe, and stand beside our cars. We exchange somewhat silly goodbyes and as the conversation dies, we stare at each other. Her shining green eyes are the only thing I see. We take a beat before leaning forward towards each other. Then we kiss. A magical, remarkable, interstellar kiss. One in which time stops forever and we float off the ground. I've got the goofiest smile on my face and she has her intense stare of affection. We laught again and part ways for the night.

On the drive home in made entity of happiness. Smiling non stop like a moron and wishing I could be next to her again.

I get back home and as I'm laying in bed, I'm open my messenger app. I text her something stupid and she replied instantly. We then proceeded to text for hours on end. Talking about everything and nothing at all. We then start to meet everyday, spend every moment we can with eachother. Learning, growing, laughing, playing, working, living, and loving. We have just started out journey of building the most magical life two people could have on this planet. Full of love and affection and anything anybody could ever want.

We did it. We took the world by storm and did the impossible. We found each other amongst an endless see of souls, drawn together by the stars. Happier than the meaning of the word. Never alone again because we have eachother forever. My chest of warm and I'm glowing from inside and out, seratonin rushing through my brain, forever grateful for what I have.

1ic70vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/1ic70vs/organization_breaking_contract/,Organization Breaking Contract,"Grant writer here (and sole proprietor of a small business). I worked for a nonprofit on a one-grant project last year. We won the grant. Afterwards, they were so excited that they stated they wanted me to both find and write grants for them long term. As a contractor, I drew up the retainer agreement, sent it for them to review, and both the CFOO and the CEO of the non-profit signed off on it. I then got to work. 

Key contract details:

$5K monthly retainer guaranteeing an average of two foundation or corporate grant proposal submissions per month, or a total of 24 total grant submissions over the length of the contract. 

Contract length: 12 months. 


After winning them $62K in just two months and working very hard at building them a pipeline, researching each opportunity, making phone calls, performing data research, arranging site visits with funders, writing my heart out with each application, and turning down other contract opportunities, they now want to breach the contract and start paying me significantly less. First they proposed skipping paying some months. Then they proposed paying me half the agreed-upon fee and decreasing my workload altogether. Now they‚Äôre pushing for decreasing the length of the contract from 12 months to six. 

They said that they are facing multiple crises at the nonprofit, injuries, employees going on disability leave, compliance issues with the state, investigations, etc. They are a group home for people with intellectual disabilities and have a dozen group homes throughout the state. They have always had poor cash reserves. 

The CFOO makes close to 200K. The CEO makes 140K. The entire executive team is well-paid, each making close to six figures if not more. The husband of the CFOO makes $80K as the maintenance man. They just opened a coffee shop that‚Äôs supposed to be generating income for the non-profit but which so far is just putting them in the hole. 

Things are bad. They obviously made a mistake with the coffee shop and are now trying to cut costs. As the contracted grant writer, I guess I‚Äôm the first on the cutting block. 

I understand ending a business relationship with a vendor, laying workers off, etc. There‚Äôs only so much money to go around, especially with non-profits. But is it ethical to not honor a contract? Is their misuse of funds my problem?

The CFOO tried to guilt trip me when I told her that I expect the contract to be adhered to. She said my lack of understanding and flexibility when it comes to struggling charitable orgs will be noted. Like, am I really the bad guy in this scenario? Why would she commit to a 12-month agreement if their org was that unstable? 

The CEO, who is more understanding than the CFOO and seems to value me more, said she‚Äôd call an emergency board meeting and try to raise the funds to pay me. Keep in mind, I have already brought in more money than what my contract is worth, with hundreds and thousands of dollars in grant dollars currently pending approval. We are only three months into the relationship‚Ä¶

But this is incredibly discouraging, I won‚Äôt lie. What should I do? Work with them? Stand my ground?

1ic70e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RosterArchitects/comments/1ic70e6/glen_coffee_not_answering_my_fantasy_football/,Glen Coffee: Not answering my fantasy football prayers....,"You know, fantasy football rookie draft capital is like a golden ticket to heaven‚Äîexcept instead of angels, it‚Äôs CeeDee Lamb in a PPR league. But let‚Äôs be honest, half the time, you‚Äôre not walking through pearly gates; you‚Äôre boarding a Greyhound bus with a one-way ticket to Disappointmentville. And that‚Äôs if the bus shows up on time, which, if we‚Äôre being real, it usually doesn‚Äôt.

Take Glen Coffee, for example. If you don‚Äôt remember him, well, congratulations‚Äîyou didn‚Äôt draft him in your dynasty league. Glen Coffee was *the guy* in 2009. He was supposed to be the answer to our prayers, the savior of fantasy football rosters. Everyone was ready to anoint him as the next Adrian Peterson or, at the very least, a discount Frank Gore. But spoiler alert: Glen Coffee‚Äôs NFL career lasted about as long as a pot of actual coffee stays warm.

# The Hype Train That Ran Out of Steam

Coming out of Alabama, Glen Coffee looked like a can‚Äôt-miss prospect. And dynasty managers? We‚Äôre like kids at Christmas‚Äîevery rookie is a shiny new toy. You think, *This is it! This is the one! He‚Äôs going to take me to the playoffs and probably change my life while he‚Äôs at it!* Then, six months later, that shiny new toy is broken, missing pieces, and somehow it‚Äôs your fault.

Glen Coffee had the speed, the size, the pedigree‚Äîeverything you‚Äôd want. So, naturally, fantasy managers were drafting him with all the confidence of a dad buying a used car: ‚ÄúYeah, I know this is going to work out because I‚Äôve done *zero research* beyond a five-minute ESPN clip.‚Äù Little did we know that Glen Coffee would retire after just one NFL season to pursue ministry. And listen, that‚Äôs an incredible career pivot and genuinely inspiring. But for the people who wasted their rookie picks? Oh, we needed some ministry *ourselves.*

# The Opportunity Cost of Coffee

Let‚Äôs take a moment to see what fantasy managers could‚Äôve had instead. Glen Coffee went in the third round of the NFL draft. You know who else came out of that draft class? LeSean McCoy. That‚Äôs right. *Shady McCoy.* Fantasy royalty for nearly a decade. Then there‚Äôs Mike Wallace, Hakeem Nicks, and Jeremy Maclin‚Äîall of whom were PPR machines compared to Glen Coffee. Heck, even *Johnny Knox* put up better fantasy numbers, and I‚Äôm pretty sure half of you don‚Äôt even remember Johnny Knox existed.

Drafting Coffee over these guys was like choosing gas station sushi over a steak dinner because, ‚ÄúYou know what? It just feels like it might hit today.‚Äù Spoiler: It doesn‚Äôt.

# Unrealistic Expectations and Fantasy Football Delusions

Now, let‚Äôs not be too hard on Glen Coffee. It‚Äôs not his fault fantasy managers thought he was the second coming of LaDainian Tomlinson. But it is wild how we convince ourselves that *this* rookie will be different. We look at 40-yard dash times like they‚Äôre gospel. A guy could have three good games in college, and we‚Äôre ready to tattoo his name on our foreheads. ‚ÄúThis guy is *special*,‚Äù we say. And yeah, he‚Äôs special, all right‚Äîspecial enough to end up on your league‚Äôs waiver wire by Week 4.

Fantasy football makes us delusional. We think we‚Äôre these brilliant GMs uncovering hidden gems, but really, we‚Äôre just clicking buttons and praying. It‚Äôs like when you buy a lottery ticket and start mentally spending the money before the numbers are even drawn. Except in fantasy football, you‚Äôre spending it on Glen Coffee, and by the end of the season, you‚Äôre in debt.

# Lessons Learned (Sort Of)

So, what‚Äôs the lesson here? Maybe it‚Äôs that we should manage our expectations better. Or maybe it‚Äôs that we shouldn‚Äôt put so much faith in a rookie draft pick with a name like Glen Coffee. I mean, come on. That‚Äôs not a football name. That‚Äôs a name for a guy who owns a hardware store and gives great advice about fertilizer.

But honestly, fantasy football is supposed to be fun, right? If Glen Coffee taught us anything, it‚Äôs that even when things don‚Äôt work out, there‚Äôs always next season‚Äîand maybe next season, we‚Äôll finally pick someone who doesn‚Äôt retire before they‚Äôve even unpacked their cleats.

# Well Wishes for Glen (and a Light Ban from Fantasy)

To Glen Coffee, if you‚Äôre reading this, we wish you all the best in life and ministry. You‚Äôve inspired people in ways far beyond football, and that‚Äôs amazing. But also, if you ever think about joining a fantasy league, we‚Äôre going to have to politely ask you to sit that one out. Roster Architects has a strict ‚Äúno Coffee‚Äù policy‚Äîdecaf or otherwise.

So here‚Äôs to rookie draft capital: the most expensive lesson in patience and humility you‚Äôll ever pay for. And here‚Äôs to Glen Coffee, who reminded us that sometimes, it‚Äôs not about the stats‚Äîit‚Äôs about the story.",1,1738085443.0,RosterArchitects,0,1.0,False

1ic6vgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ic6vgn/treated_with_ppis_and_h2_blockers_for_gastritis/,Treated with PPIs and H2 blockers for gastritis and esophagitis while having positive GPCAb,"I have chronic antrum gastritis, esophagitis, and a loose LES, all confirmed through endoscopies with biopsy findings showing gastric metaplasia in my esophagus. I‚Äôve been treated three times with pantoprazole and once with omeprazole, each course lasting about a month. However, I had to stop each time due to side effects: nausea, pale stools, and severe bloating after meals. Also PPIs offer me very little relief‚Äîmaybe 10-15% at best. I also tried famotidine, which didn‚Äôt cause side effects but didn‚Äôt help either. Currently, I‚Äôm taking domperidone, which significantly improves my bloating and bowel movements, both of which were terrible before starting the medication.

My first endoscopy also detected bile in my stomach, but unfortunately, I drank water before my second endoscopy, which flushed any bile (if present) out of my system before the procedure.

I recently found out that I‚Äôve had positive Gastric Parietal Cell Antibodies (GPCAb) for at least 3‚Äì4 years, though doctors never specifically told me. Additionally, my stool calprotectin levels have been highly elevated for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôm a 35-year-old male BTW. On top of all these nice thing , I have SIBO, lactose intolerance, histamine intolerance, and seborrheic dermatitis (on my scalp and the T-zone of my face). I also have chronic dry eyes, though I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs related.

My doctors still want to keep me on PPIs only to reduce the dosage. But I‚Äôm starting to question whether my stomach acid is actually too high‚Äîit might be the opposite (I am trying to get a test for this ... so far not succesful).

If I understand correctly, my body is attacking my parietal cells, which produce stomach acid. As a result, it seems more likely that my stomach acid is too low, and PPIs could be making it worse. Low stomach acid might decrease motility, leading to SIBO and bile reflux. Additionally, the autoimmune reaction causes inflammation in my stomach, which, combined with low acid, likely reduces nutrient absorption (I‚Äôve experienced significant weight loss). Does this make sense, or am I overthinking it? The only thing that doesn‚Äôt quite add up is that endoscopy found most of the inflammation in my antrum (the bottom part of the stomach), not in the fundus and body of the stomach where most parietal cells are located. But perhaps this inflammation is secondary to bile reflux‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure.

Does anyone else relate to this? What should I do? I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right to manage my gastritis and esophagitis: low-acid, bland diet, sleeping on an incline, avoiding lying down 3‚Äì4 hours after meals, no coffee, alcohol, or other triggers etc. etc. Still, nothing seems to help. I‚Äôm already in the LPR stage, so I don‚Äôt feel heartburn anymore (only occasionally at the back of my throat). But my throat and nose are congested all the time (especially in the morning after weaking up together with acid taste in my mouth), my voice becomes hoarse after just a few minutes of speaking, and I constantly feel the globus sensation.",1,1738085110.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/s/K6OawmIRUk

I can boil it down to a couple of things that give me 80% of my motivation and energy. I stopped doing most of the things on that list, but I have even more energy now.
	
1.	I minimized the use of social media to the bare minimum. Most of the stuff people post there is demotivating as fuck. People suck on the internet. Social media and almost every news story or reel just make you feel bad. I didn‚Äôt realize how toxic it was until I stopped it, still struggling sometimes tho
	
2.	I started meditating. A very lazy activity, for people like us. Super important: find a position where you won‚Äôt fall asleep but can sit comfortably with ‚Äúdignity‚Äù. The main takeaway for me? It gives me time and complete focus on myself and my needs. Learning about yourself and what you truly like‚Äînot what people tell you to like‚Äîis huge. I started small, just sitting for 10 minutes in silence and focusing on my forehead or belly. Now I can meditate for an hour, and my head feels so clear. I know exactly why I feel the way I do, and I‚Äôm much more aware of my needs. Highly recommend.
	
3.	I started drinking electrolytes. I can‚Äôt force myself to drink a ton of water, but with electrolytes, it‚Äôs easy. It tastes good and helps my body function better. I didn‚Äôt realize how much low blood pressure was screwing with my mood until this fixed it.
	
4.	Find something to work on. Doesn‚Äôt matter what it is. I started programming and feel happy learning something new every day. Writing a book also helps me reflect on myself even more‚ÄîI absolutely love it.

What I stopped doing:
Coffee, Antidepressants, drugs, peptides, Everyday heavy lifting (replaced it with light cardio)
I switched to a meat-only diet (with some cheat days). No carbs, no trash food. A $7 steak, fish, or chicken a day works best for me‚Äîthough obviously, everyone‚Äôs diet is different. Stopped journaling, accepted I‚Äôm not that social but I have different strengths.

Two years ago, things were really bad for me. I tried so much stupid shit, even injected pig brains into my body (yeah, I know), but the truth is, everything is so much simpler than that. If I could do it, you can definitely do it too. Hope it helps",2,1738084926.0,anhedonia,0,1.0,False

I have a bit of a dilemma. I‚Äôm talking to this guy- we‚Äôre not dating- but we‚Äôre just in the talking stages. He‚Äôs sweet and funny and goofy but there is an elephant-in-the-room situation. I‚Äôm 18 and he‚Äôs 22. It took him a while to come around to the idea of us talking cuz at first he was scared of that kind of age gap, which I get. When we first met he didn‚Äôt know my age and we were hitting it off and flirting and stuff, but he didn‚Äôt learn my age at the end of the night. We did meet like two weeks after that Christmas party, but after that we didn‚Äôt talk to each other for a month. 

I was giving him space and then I thought that maybe he didn‚Äôt like me in that way and it was all in my head and then Saturday he asked me on a coffee sat and then the next day, at 12, he got his coffee and paid for my tea and we talked for 2 hrs (didn‚Äôt feel like it). He was sweet and respectful and gave me a hug afterwards when I asked for one. He‚Äôs not a big Texter, I‚Äôve found out. He‚Äôs better with talking in-person. 

I have rlly bad anxiety and the voices are telling me that he‚Äôs not texting me cuz he‚Äôs anxious about the age thing. He said that he‚Äôd be ok with 20 and 24 but 22 and 18 is a bit scary. Also, I didn‚Äôt hear that from him, I heard it down the grapevine, she he wasn‚Äôt the one to tell me that he was wary of the age gap (tho I alr put it together myself)

I like him, I wanna go slow, not rush things. Especially since I just met him. Also, when he asks me about my day I feel awkward mentioning high school stuff to him cuz I think it reminds him about my age and I don‚Äôt want to scare him away üò≠

1ic6mwz,https://i.redd.it/7ymjl5coprfe1.jpeg,Lattafa Kamrah Qahwa,"So today I got my hands on this beautiful bottle. Since few weeks I had been wanting to get a sweet and boozy fragrance under 3k and after digging in a little I came to the conclusion that Kamrah and Kamrah Qahwa are the two feasible options. And eventually settled with Kamrah Qahwa due to its coffee note (I love coffee).


Comming to the fragrance. See I am no fragrance connoisseur who will be able to distinguish each and every note and give a detailed review. I am just a chill guy who enjoys fragrances and wants to contribute to this community.


I recieved the package as I was leaving for the gym so I decided to spray once on my wrist to see how it developed over time.


So, as soon as a sprayed I could smell the sweetness and the booziness with a tinge of coffee which I really loved. I held the atomiser close to my nose and it straightaway felt like whiskey.


I made my mother smell it and she liked it too. And she is not the one who easily likes perfumes. She usually gives me an eye roll whenever I make her smell any of my perfume or if I ever over spray.

As I went about with my exercises, I kept on getting a whiff of the perfume every once in a while and it gave sweet vanilla vibes. 


After that I came back home, washed my hands, had dinner, washed my hands again and I can still smell some of the vanilla if I deliberately make an attempt to smell it.


So overall, I felt that it is a very good and pretty long lasting perfume amd it is someting that suits my tastes. 


To summarise everything: It is a sweet and alcoholic fragrance on a base of vanilla with a tinge of coffee.

Presentation: 9/10
The bottle: 9/10
Atomiser: 7/10
Fragrance: 8/10

So, we (20M, 19F) met on December 28th. I was at a chicken restaurant with friends when she (19F) came in. After we paid the bill, I went over to her table, complimented her, and asked for her Instagram. She accepted and gave it to me. I messaged her later, saying that we could meet up if she was interested, and she agreed. We arranged a time and place.

Before meeting her, I bought her a bouquet of coquina flowers (since it was New Year‚Äôs and every girl seemed to have coquinas in hand) and a 4-pack of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. When we met, she asked for my name because she had forgotten it‚ÄîI let it slide. Then we went to a Starbucks, where I bought us coffee.

While we were chatting, her phone rang. The caller was saved as ""My little bugggg <3."" She got up to take the call, trash-talking the guy who had called. She mentioned that he was toxic and made a generalization about guys from his country being toxic (she‚Äôs a foreigner, and she was talking about my country). However, she added, ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not like them.‚Äù (I‚Äôm from the same country she had just criticized.)

We chatted for a while, though I started feeling uncomfortable. At one point, she looked at her watch, and I asked if we should leave. She declined, so we stayed and chatted more. After leaving Starbucks, she suddenly said, ‚ÄúI like \_\_\_ street food.‚Äù Wanting to be a gentleman, I bought her that street food and even hand-fed her. She seemed happy (understandably, lol).

Since I had invited her on the date, I covered all the costs. Later, we parted ways at the metro station, but not before taking some pictures together. That night, I asked her to send me the photos, and she responded five days later. She ghosted me for a while after that, but then messaged me again. I started replying late too‚Äînot days late, but around 10 hours or so.

Eventually, we talked again, and she suggested we meet up. Up until two days ago, I had been posting Instagram stories that made me look rich and bourgeois. She saw the stories but didn‚Äôt reply. Then, three days later, she saw one of my stories and messaged, ‚ÄúWhere is this place? We should go there together.‚Äù I think one reason she replied was because of how I appeared in the stories.

We arranged a time and place for our next meeting. I baked some cinnamon rolls for the occasion. On the day, I picked her up, and we greeted each other with a handshake. Once we got in the car, we chatted. She showed me her nails, I complimented them, and then asked for permission to kiss her hand‚Äîshe obliged.

When we reached our destination, she connected her phone to Bluetooth and played some music on the way. We unpacked and sat in a park, chatting. I asked what she was drinking, and she said beer, so I bought us a couple of beers and shared the cinnamon rolls. I tried to be as gentle as possible and even brought a poncho in case she felt cold.

We talked for a while, and I kissed her hand, complimented her, and said some romantic and poetic things in her language. At one point, she asked, ‚ÄúWhere do you see yourself in 20 years?‚Äù I answered something like, ‚ÄúI see myself as a successful businessman or a pilot.‚Äù

We spent around 2‚Äì3 hours there. Later, she said she was too tired, so I offered to carry her. She said yes, and I carried her part of the way on my back and in my arms. When we got to the car, she mentioned craving sushi. I initially complained about the cost of sushi restaurants but eventually took her to one and bought us a 12-piece sushi platter. Hand-fed her again to be romantic.

We ate and chatted. I paid the bill, and when we left the restaurant, I carried her to the car again (it was across the street). She seemed shy. Since we couldn‚Äôt decide on another place to go, I asked if she was sleepy. She said yes, so I drove her home. During the ride, I held her hand. She played ‚ÄúCareless Whisper‚Äù by George Michael and even placed my hand on her thigh.

When we arrived, we ended the day with a hug that started with a handshake. I complimented her, saying she smelled amazing, and she blushed. Afterward, I messaged her to check if she‚Äôd reached her apartment safely, and we texted a bit.

From a girl who ghosted me for five days, she‚Äôs now responding to my texts within a few hours.

In case we met for cinema or bowling should I split the bill? bowling is a little bit more affordable but cinema is too expensive. Help me.

# My questions:

1. Is this the start of a strong relationship?
2. Since I‚Äôm a university student with a finite income (I still receive pocket money from my family), how can I politely suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy? I sense that this relationship might become expensive.
3. What are some red flags you notice from my experience?

TLDR;  
Met a girl, asked her out, and paid for everything on two dates (flowers, coffee, food, sushi). She ghosted me after the first date but became more responsive after seeing my Instagram stories. On the second date, she seemed more interested, holding hands and playing romantic music.

Have you ever felt stuck in your business, wondering what‚Äôs missing? You‚Äôve got strategies, skills, and a solid work ethic, but something still feels off. Here‚Äôs where a lesser-discussed tool can help: manifestation affirmations. No, it‚Äôs not some woo-woo magic‚Äîit‚Äôs about reprogramming your mindset for success.

Let‚Äôs break it down, step by step, so you can actually apply this and see results. If you want to manifest using affirmation then check[ How to manifest Job using 369 technique](https://www.shubook.in/369-manifestation-for-job/)¬†



# What Are Business Manifestation Affirmations?

Simply put, affirmations are positive statements that help reshape your beliefs. When you focus on affirmations related to business success, you align your thoughts with the outcomes you desire. Think of it as training your brain to stop doubting and start believing.

For example:

* **‚ÄúI attract the right opportunities effortlessly.‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúI am confident in my ability to grow my business.‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúSuccess and abundance flow to me easily.‚Äù**

These aren‚Äôt just fluffy sentences. When repeated consistently, they can transform the way you think about challenges, opportunities, and your own abilities.



# Why Do Affirmations Work?

Here‚Äôs the science-backed truth: your brain listens to what you feed it. A concept called **neuroplasticity** shows that our brains can rewire themselves based on repeated thoughts and behaviors. By using affirmations, you‚Äôre creating new neural pathways that prioritize confidence, focus, and positivity.

When you repeat affirmations, you‚Äôre essentially telling your subconscious, ‚ÄúThis is my reality.‚Äù Over time, your actions naturally align with those beliefs. You start noticing opportunities, taking bolder steps, and handling setbacks more calmly. [Manifest Good grades using affirmation](https://www.shubook.in/how-to-manifest-good-grades-in-exam-2025/).



# How to Create Effective Affirmations

You can‚Äôt just throw words into the air and expect results. There‚Äôs a method to this:

1. **Keep It Positive** Say what you want, not what you don‚Äôt. For instance, instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of failure,‚Äù say, ‚ÄúI learn and grow from every experience.‚Äù  
2. **Use the Present Tense** Frame your affirmation as if it‚Äôs already true. ‚ÄúI am successful,‚Äù not ‚ÄúI will be successful.‚Äù  
3. **Make It Personal** Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to make the affirmation resonate deeply with you.  
4. **Be Specific** Broad statements are fine, but adding some clarity helps. For instance, ‚ÄúI close deals with ease‚Äù is better than ‚ÄúI succeed.‚Äù  



# Daily Rituals to Boost Manifestation

The magic happens when affirmations become a regular part of your day. Here‚Äôs how to integrate them:

1. **Morning Routine** Start your day by saying your affirmations aloud. Look in the mirror and speak with confidence‚Äîit‚Äôs surprisingly empowering.  
2. **Write Them Down** Keep a journal where you write your affirmations every morning or night. Writing makes them feel more tangible.  
3. **Visualization** Pair affirmations with mental imagery. As you say, ‚ÄúI attract financial abundance,‚Äù picture your business thriving‚Äîhappy customers, strong sales, and a growing team.  
4. **Sticky Notes and Reminders** Place affirmations where you‚Äôll see them often: your desk, your phone‚Äôs lock screen, or even on your coffee mug.  



# Examples of Business Manifestation Affirmations

If you‚Äôre not sure where to start, here are some affirmations tailored for business owners and entrepreneurs:

* ‚ÄúI am a magnet for profitable opportunities.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEvery challenge I face strengthens my business.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI provide value to my clients, and they reward me generously.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMy hard work pays off in amazing ways.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI am open to new ideas that lead to success.‚Äù



# Does It Actually Work?

It‚Äôs natural to feel skeptical, especially if you‚Äôre new to this concept. But consider this: successful entrepreneurs like Oprah Winfrey, Jim Carrey, and Sara Blakely swear by the power of affirmations. The key isn‚Äôt just in saying them‚Äîit‚Äôs in believing them, acting on them, and staying consistent.



# My Personal words

Business manifestation affirmations aren‚Äôt a replacement for hard work or smart strategies. Instead, they‚Äôre a complement, a way to supercharge your mindset so you can seize opportunities and handle setbacks like a pro.

Start small. Pick 3 affirmations that resonate with you, and commit to saying them daily for the next 30 days. The results might surprise you‚Äînot just in your business, but in your overall confidence and energy.

Remember, success begins in your mind. So, what‚Äôs stopping you from thinking big?

Pair this with affirmations like, ‚ÄúI grow my business daily.‚Äù Use gratitude to acknowledge small wins, and stay consistent in your efforts. Journaling helps track progress, while aligning actions with intentions ensures results.

Start with, ‚ÄúI approach this week with energy and focus,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI embrace challenges as opportunities for growth.‚Äù These affirmations replace any Monday blues with enthusiasm. Focus on setting intentions for a productive week and trust that your efforts will pay off. Repeating affirmations can transform Mondays into a launchpad for success instead of a day to dread.



# Affirmations for Business Women

Phrases like, ‚ÄúI lead with strength and compassion,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am worthy of success and recognition,‚Äù empower women to embrace leadership roles confidently.

This never happened if I got coffee from somewhere else or from a Keurig.. 

Recently I heard there was some random testing done on their coffee and mold was found in it.  I don't know if the mold was in the actual coffee grounds prior to brewing or if the mold is from the machines and canisters not being washed properly.

I‚Äôm an aging millennial, and honestly, my bank account isn‚Äôt looking much better than it did two decades ago. I remember as a teenager, I‚Äôd be glued to the TV, listening to all the advice Suze Orman would give on Oprah. One of her big pieces of advice that stuck with me was to ‚Äúditch the takeaway coffee.‚Äù I took that to heart, and here I am, years later‚Äîstill struggling. One piece of advice I didn‚Äôt take from Suze, though, was to give 10% of my income every month to charity. I get the sentiment behind it, but honestly, when you‚Äôre struggling to make ends meet, it feels like a luxury to give away that much. I don‚Äôt even have enough to cover my own expenses, let alone give a chunk away, and that advice has always felt more aspirational than practical for someone in my situation.

I‚Äôve read a ton of books and watched tons of TV shows about financial advice over the years. Everything from budgeting tips to investment strategies, and while some advice might be helpful in small ways, it hasn‚Äôt changed my overall situation. So here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm starting to feel like the bottom line is this‚Äîif you really want to save a lot, you need to earn a lot. And that requires a mix of luck and hard work. Hard work alone doesn‚Äôt cut it. Sometimes, you just need to be in the right place at the right time. The advice about cutting out small expenses‚Äîlike takeaway coffee‚Äîfeels like a distraction from the bigger picture. It‚Äôs just not enough.

In my opinion, most of these so-called ‚Äúfinancial experts‚Äù aren‚Äôt even really experts. They‚Äôre just random people who appear on TV, trying to sell their books and the idea that their advice will somehow solve your financial struggles. But, in the end, the reality is much more complex than following a few tips.

I‚Äôm sharing this here because I feel like so many of us are just doing our best to make ends meet, and no amount of budgeting is going to change that unless we‚Äôre earning more. It‚Äôs hard to not feel like you‚Äôve been fed a bunch of ‚Äúhacks‚Äù that don‚Äôt work, while the real issue is how out-of-reach financial stability can feel sometimes.",40,1738084065.0,povertyfinance,12,0.94,False

# James Bond: Bean Grinder

**Starring:**

* *James Bond*: Played by **Henry Cavill**, portraying the suave yet gritty MI6 agent.
* *Villain*: **Mads Mikkelsen** as **Magnus Grindstein**, a ruthless coffee mogul turned eco-terrorist.
* *Bond Girl*: **Ana de Armas** as **Lucia Santos**, a Brazilian botanist with secrets of her own.
* *Q*: **Ben Whishaw**, reprising his role as the tech wizard.
* *M*: **Judi Dench** (in a special return appearance as a voice guiding Bond through encrypted messages).

# Plot Summary:

The story begins in **Colombia**, where the world's largest coffee plantation mysteriously goes up in flames. MI6 uncovers whispers of a sinister new threat: Magnus Grindstein, the enigmatic CEO of **GrindCore Enterprises**, has been stockpiling rare coffee beans while sabotaging global supplies. His ultimate goal? To create a worldwide dependency on his genetically engineered ""GrindX Bean"" ‚Äî a coffee that enhances focus but causes subtle, long-term addiction.

Bond is sent to investigate, beginning with a covert infiltration of GrindCore‚Äôs high-tech plantation in **Brazil‚Äôs Amazon Rainforest**. There, he meets **Lucia Santos**, a brilliant botanist who has been coerced into working for Grindstein. Lucia holds the key to stopping the addictive GrindX formula, but her loyalty is uncertain.

As Bond digs deeper, he uncovers Grindstein‚Äôs true plan: using a **solar-powered ""Bean Grinder"" satellite** to release a dust storm of addictive coffee particles into Earth's atmosphere, ensuring everyone becomes enslaved to his product. The satellite, disguised as a harmless environmental initiative, is poised to activate during a global climate summit in **Vienna**.

# Key Moments:

* **Opening Action Sequence:** A thrilling chase through the coffee markets of **Istanbul**, where Bond battles Grindstein‚Äôs henchmen amidst exploding coffee sacks and runaway delivery trucks.
* **Villain's Lair:** Grindstein's rainforest headquarters, an architectural marvel built into a volcanic crater, featuring coffee-powered drones and espresso-fueled energy weapons.
* **Romantic Subplot:** Bond and Lucia‚Äôs relationship sizzles as they work together to destroy GrindCore‚Äôs labs, only to uncover Lucia‚Äôs personal vendetta against Grindstein for exploiting her family‚Äôs coffee farm.
* **Final Showdown:** A dramatic zero-gravity fight aboard the Bean Grinder satellite, as Bond and Grindstein battle amidst floating coffee beans. Grindstein meets his end when he‚Äôs sucked into a malfunctioning coffee grinder, leaving Bond to disable the satellite just in time.

# Signature Bond Quips:

* When Bond defeats a henchman by dunking him into a boiling coffee vat: ‚ÄúLooks like he couldn‚Äôt handle the daily grind.‚Äù
* After Grindstein‚Äôs satellite explodes: ‚ÄúTime for a fresh brew.‚ÄùSignature Bond Quips:When Bond defeats a henchman by dunking him into a boiling coffee vat: ‚ÄúLooks like he couldn‚Äôt handle the daily grind.‚Äù After Grindstein‚Äôs satellite explodes: ‚ÄúTime for a fresh brew.‚Äù

I have two friends I met at work: a girl(26F) I've known for 1 years and a guy (32M) for 6 months. They meet 3 months ago and have become quite close ever since (coffee breaks every day, a few drinks together, daily messages). The girl, who has been in a relationship for 6,5 years, confessed to me that she's interested in our mutual friend. However, she is not sure if the guy is interested in her. She sees some signs (ambiguous messages and the way he looks at her), but is quite lost.

They spend a lot of time together at work. However, outside of it, they usually hang out with me. Overall, I never felt uncomfortable because when I'm around, it just seems like they're good friends, not flirting. But in the past 1-2 weeks, my friend's behavior has changed. She becomes more and more forward with him when I'm there, teasing and openly flirting with him. His behavior hasn't changed. If he's interested in her, he has the decency not to show it when I'm around.

I feel uncomfortable and like a third wheel. Two days ago, I talked to my friend about it and told her i prefer not to see them alone as a trio. I didn't specify that it was her behavior that bothered me because I was afraid of hurting her feelings (to be honest, I am not okay with the situation, but obviously, I will never tell her that to her face)

I'm getting tired of this situation where I feel caught between the two. The only solution I see is to distance myself from both of them and stop seeing them. This is where I need some advice. I'm afraid that distancing myself suddenly will raise questions that I can't answer without betraying what my friend confess. Also, I'm quite sad because I know I'll have to distance myself from the guy. I used to see him without her, but since she arrived, we only see each other as a trio.

I want to put this prediction out there now while things are most bleak, and it seems very unlikely, so that it doesn't seem like I'm just bandwagoning if things turn around.

Anyway, I think there's a very real possibility that Trump gets impeached AND convicted.  The reason I say this is because in Trump's first term, his admin was populated largely by career people that would temper his craziest influence, and basically prevented him from driving the country off a cliff.

Now though?  They're gone.  It's all loyalists.  Trump can do whatever he wants, and his current stated policy will be a DISASTER for the American economy.

If he does these tariffs, and it looks like he will, we are talking possibly 100% price increases for most groceries.  And his war on federal employees could severely impact the governments ability to function, possibly even stopping social security checks.

And look, I don't care about how much media you control, if you spike grocery prices, you are in trouble.  East Germany literally collapsed because the price of coffee was too high.  And believe me, they had lots of media control behind the iron curtain.

My last point is that in America, you don't get impeached because you are a criminal or corrupt.  You get impeached because you're unpopular.

If this trade war spikes the price of everyday goods, Trump's approval will nosedive.  And eventually it will get to the point where even the GOP is pressured to vote to impeach.",50,1738083784.0,Destiny,54,0.88,False

I've done the ""help me choose quiz"" to help you pick, but the differences between the types doesn't seem that transparent and I can't work out. It doesn't help that the website jumps about and I just seem to get insanely angry looking at it and so can't concentrate to do my usual rabbit hole of new purchase research. 

The main times I think I would use them would be things like:
. Supermarket
. Coffee shop where it's clattery and noisy, but I'm meeting someone and need to focus on what they're saying
. I work in an open plan office which isn't very loud but I can be quite sensitive to what noise there is when I'm trying to concentrate
. I have misophonia
. I also have tinnitus (the high pitched whistle one), which I know a few people say the earplugs help with

I'd be grateful for any advice or to hear your experiences! I think I'm leaning towards Switch so I can have more flexibility, but are they as good as each setting as the corresponding single type earplugs? Would I be better getting say Engage Plus so I have those two options?

I'd just like some outside perspective on is this a red flag, considered cheating etc

so the whole story is from my perspective atleast 

my girlfriend and her ex started messaging each other back and forth around march - April last year (2024)
i found out she was messaging her ex in November (2024)
i asked her who it was when i seen a notification on her phone pop up and it was a guy's name I'd never seen before.
my GF said it was an ex who had been messaging and told me a little bit about it.
fast forward to Today and i feel like it's been kept a secret.
like she's had a conscious thought not to tell me that she's messaging an EX despite how I might feel or because I'd react negatively.
just to clarify I'd never have asked her to cut contact 
unless there was a definite reason i thought he was
trying to get her to cheat.

during the 6 ish months they've been messaging there's been multiple talks about meeting up and getting coffee.

my GF said ""there's never been any intent on cheating, so it's fine"" 

but idk it feels wrong the fact it feels like it's been kept a secret.

i asked her 2 nights ago if she would have told me if i hadn't seen the notification and found out. she said she wouldn't have told me, because there was no intent on cheating so it was fine.
but she told me today if they were meeting up she would have told me after they had organised to meet up or if it had came up.

summarised (i guess?)

i feel that my GF has kept it a secret that she was messaging her ex, i found out, asked if she would had told me and she said no.
is this considered a red flag or cheating etc?
she says she would have told me After they had organised to meet up.
I've asked a couple friends and they've said this is emotional cheating?
the fact it's been kept a secret is what hurts.
I'd have been fine with going with her for a coffee to meet her ex or something.
it just feels messy, alot of excuses, like my feelings have been completely disregarded and it's been kept a secret.

EDIT.
from the responses I've got here and from Dm's its clear that I'm atleast not totally insane for thinking this. this will be the only edit (i think) i want to thank the people that have dm'ed me and the people that have commented and any future comments/dms about it, I'll keep this account up for a couple days. so here's the follow up:

there's been other situations as well, this is just the most recent one, I'm definitely not saying I've been the perfect boyfriend however due to previous events on both sides (not cheating on either side just to clarify)
we're both at the point were we're done and there's no salvaging it.
my trust has been completely broken.
she doesn't understand how she's hurt me, she can't see what she's done wrong.
she doesn't respect or even care about my feelings or our relationship and it's evident she hasn't for a long time.
thank you everyone.

# James Bond: Bean Grinder

**Starring:**

* *James Bond*: Played by **Henry Cavill**, portraying the suave yet gritty MI6 agent.
* *Villain*: **Mads Mikkelsen** as **Magnus Grindstein**, a ruthless coffee mogul turned eco-terrorist.
* *Bond Girl*: **Ana de Armas** as **Lucia Santos**, a Brazilian botanist with secrets of her own.
* *Q*: **Ben Whishaw**, reprising his role as the tech wizard.
* *M*: **Judi Dench** (in a special return appearance as a voice guiding Bond through encrypted messages).

# Plot Summary:

The story begins in **Colombia**, where the world's largest coffee plantation mysteriously goes up in flames. MI6 uncovers whispers of a sinister new threat: Magnus Grindstein, the enigmatic CEO of **GrindCore Enterprises**, has been stockpiling rare coffee beans while sabotaging global supplies. His ultimate goal? To create a worldwide dependency on his genetically engineered ""GrindX Bean"" ‚Äî a coffee that enhances focus but causes subtle, long-term addiction.

Bond is sent to investigate, beginning with a covert infiltration of GrindCore‚Äôs high-tech plantation in **Brazil‚Äôs Amazon Rainforest**. There, he meets **Lucia Santos**, a brilliant botanist who has been coerced into working for Grindstein. Lucia holds the key to stopping the addictive GrindX formula, but her loyalty is uncertain.

As Bond digs deeper, he uncovers Grindstein‚Äôs true plan: using a **solar-powered ""Bean Grinder"" satellite** to release a dust storm of addictive coffee particles into Earth's atmosphere, ensuring everyone becomes enslaved to his product. The satellite, disguised as a harmless environmental initiative, is poised to activate during a global climate summit in **Vienna**.

# Key Moments:

* **Opening Action Sequence:** A thrilling chase through the coffee markets of **Istanbul**, where Bond battles Grindstein‚Äôs henchmen amidst exploding coffee sacks and runaway delivery trucks.
* **Villain's Lair:** Grindstein's rainforest headquarters, an architectural marvel built into a volcanic crater, featuring coffee-powered drones and espresso-fueled energy weapons.
* **Romantic Subplot:** Bond and Lucia‚Äôs relationship sizzles as they work together to destroy GrindCore‚Äôs labs, only to uncover Lucia‚Äôs personal vendetta against Grindstein for exploiting her family‚Äôs coffee farm.
* **Final Showdown:** A dramatic zero-gravity fight aboard the Bean Grinder satellite, as Bond and Grindstein battle amidst floating coffee beans. Grindstein meets his end when he‚Äôs sucked into a malfunctioning coffee grinder, leaving Bond to disable the satellite just in time.

# Signature Bond Quips:

* When Bond defeats a henchman by dunking him into a boiling coffee vat: ‚ÄúLooks like he couldn‚Äôt handle the daily grind.‚Äù
* After Grindstein‚Äôs satellite explodes: ‚ÄúTime for a fresh brew.‚ÄùSignature Bond Quips:When Bond defeats a henchman by dunking him into a boiling coffee vat: ‚ÄúLooks like he couldn‚Äôt handle the daily grind.‚Äù After Grindstein‚Äôs satellite explodes: ‚ÄúTime for a fresh brew.‚Äù

Nowadays, it doesn't matter where I go, there's always someone recording. In a damn coffee shop? There's an influencer recording their 'day in the life' video.

I've even seen videos of Uber drivers recording their interactions with passengers and posting them online.

Don't even get me started on those stupid pranks.

A few days ago, I was on an organized run in my hometown. There was a freaking drone following us the whole time. I felt uncomfortable, and the only thing I could think about was looking good, even though I was sweating, because I knew those pictures and videos would be posted online.

It's so normalized to take pictures of strangers and post them online. I hate going out in public. I'm really paranoid that someone will think I look funny and decide to take a photo of me to post on TikTok or some other platform.

It feels like no one respects personal space anymore. I‚Äôm always worried that someone will take a picture of me, just for laughs, and post it online without a second thought.

Today, having my unsweetened coffee with or without allulose just tastes like dirt water in comparison and to be honest I‚Äôve been thinking I just don‚Äôt even want coffee anymore because I guess taste-wise it was always about the sugar.

‚ÄúAs we focus on our ‚ÄòBack to Starbucks‚Äô plan, we need a new operating model for our retail team, with clear ownership and accountability and an appropriate scope for each role,‚Äù Niccol said in a letter to employees shared on the company‚Äôs website.

Before spending six years at Chipotle, Niccol served as CEO of Yum Brands‚Äô Taco Bell. Since starting at Starbucks in September, he‚Äôs already poached some of his former colleagues to help with his transformation of the coffee giant. For example, he tapped Chipotle and Yum Brands alum Tressie Lieberman as Starbucks‚Äô global chief brand office in the fall.

The newest changes to the Starbucks organization include splitting the role of North American president into two jobs; the company‚Äôs current North American president, Sara Trilling, will depart the company. Trilling has been with Starbucks since 2002.

Starting in February, Meredith Sandland will hold the role of chief store development officer. Sandland is currently CEO of Empower Delivery, a restaurant software company. Previously, she served as chief operating officer of Kitchen United and as Taco Bell‚Äôs chief development officer.

Additionally, Mike Grams will join the company in February as North America chief stores officer. Grams has been with Taco Bell for more than 30 years, starting as a restaurant general manager and working his way up to become the chain‚Äôs global chief operating officer, according to his LinkedIn.

Both Sandland and Grams will be tasked with implementing Niccol‚Äôs vision to go ‚Äúback to Starbucks.‚Äù The strategy includes decreasing service times to four minutes per order, making its stores more welcoming and cozy and slashing the menu.

Arthur Valdez, Starbucks‚Äô chief supply officer, also plans to leave the company. He joined in 2023 after seven years at Target. Starbucks has already identified his replacement and will share that news in the coming weeks, Niccol said in the letter.

Starbucks is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Wall Street is expecting the company‚Äôs same-store sales to fall for the fourth consecutive quarter as consumers in the U.S. and China opt to get their caffeine fix elsewhere.

I previously asked about credible dog chiropractors in the area but had no luck. I only trust my current local dogtor but plan to move to the IE soon. 

Dr. Maeg said she's willing to come to SoCal if she's able to find a client base big enough (6-7). She works on people, dogs, and various animals like horses, pigs, and even llamas and chickens! 

She's been an absolute lifesaver when our senior dog started having immobility issues and we seriously were worried he was beginning to deteriorate. 

If you're interested, please take the time to look at her website, videos, and testimonials and then reach out to her. Mention your area and my dog and I, Coffee & Gloria, as the referral so she knows the group. 
Her consultation fee is $120 and included examination and treatment. Every appointment thereafter is $120 card or $100 cash.

Not sure exactly what's the cause, but it looks like my Dinamica is producing wrong amount of coffee.
For instance, trying the espresso yields around 50ish ml (1.7oz or so).

I'm not sure whether it's too much beans being grinded or too much water being added, but something is off (I'm expecting 1oz).

I tried resetting to factory settings for the slight chance I might changed something by accident, no luck. 

Has anyone encountered something similar?
Not sure what's going on (I'm fairly new to the whole coffee games, even though I have the machine for a couple of years). 

Again the model is the Dinamica ECAM 350.55.

There was only the calm rustle of the batches of evergreen outside, and the occasional faint call of the fast ferries‚Äîbarely audible, as opposed to the ear-splitting blaring she had the displeasure of hearing last night. For a time. It was deafeningly quiet in the Victorian-looking library, save for the occasional venom-laced whisperings Uzi was smart enough to infer was specifically tuned for her to at least faintly overhear. It was always her. It was always something about¬†*her*¬†specifically, wasn‚Äôt it? The drone leaned against the walnut chair, bracing her book against the miniature parapet of the same material that intelligently held two sticks of light within it. But where the humans were seated looked as if they had been a replica of a Renaissance-era painting down to the most minutiae detail. Uzi‚Äôs finger twitched. Dimmed lights cradled in what looked to be gothic-style ornate mini-balconies hung low‚Äîbut not too low‚Äîfrom the stained-glass paneled ceiling as far as the eye could see, even somewhat stretching into the drone area, held in place only by a single sturdy chain of the same color. But there was a maddening difference in quality, the hexagonal cradles looked flimsy within her area, as if they were made of simple plastics and not of steel. Or was it simply cheap tin that hung above her? The surrounding architecture within the human area still retained its sprawling Victorian look, but Uzi thought not of spending minutes ogling its design in spite of its ethereal presence. She registered its somewhat celestially detailed appearance‚Äîas if the hands of God himself had painstakingly chiseled the stone from which it was made‚Äîbut at the same time it had halfly faded from her memory. But of course, they had separated that area from her kind, and she was forced to relocate to a small reading room‚Äîthe Family hadn‚Äôt done any ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù because that would be far too high-profile for their liking. Typical, but the teen understood. A drone in a human-only area with no authority doing jackshit about it would raise more than a couple eyebrows‚Äî¬†*and fists,*¬†she warily observed. Maybe some¬†*Strega*¬†would soothe her nerves. No, the herbal liqueur always gave her a throbbing headache that persisted as a faint throb far into the night. Truth be told, she preferred Irish guinness. Most nights, it cleared her mind with a far better dispelling force than the trickle of rain could be.

¬†¬†¬†It barely held a quarter of the books Uzi¬†*knew*¬†to be available in such a gargantuan library as this. There were no holo-guides that they could customize to guide them to the book they wished to read‚Äîif it was available to them. The room she was sent to was more of a child‚Äôs closet than an actual room worthy of being part of a library as this. She was barred from reading any sort of cult classics because it was of topics ‚Äúonly comprehensible to the human mind.‚Äù The simple finger-twitching quickly transformed into a rageful shaking that was quick to grow uncontrollable. Papers were dead last on her problem ladder. If only she could ever manage to get her hands on any one of them‚Ä¶ Her thoughts stopped there. It had simply collapsed, like a weakened rope snapping after being made to hold over sixty tons worth of cargo, sending it all tumbling into the raging depths of the ocean. Uzi bristled while she rubbed her thumb against the lukewarm pages she had skimmed through, her gaze flickering between the old-fashioned text and the dully sparkling material of her gloves. Anger was ambushed by sorrow, and like the thudding of a rifle‚Äôs bullets against flesh it was wrent to shreds. It was a fitting punishment for such a soulless creature as her. There it was again‚Äîthe¬†*pewt*¬†of a silenced M9, dried blood recoloring what was once a spongy yet coarse black. Every time she blinked, she saw it in increasing detail. Dots of yellowish green and squirming maggots that only moved in centimeters joined the image, though they feasted upon no corpse.¬†*Look at you,*¬†she chided. Uzi winced at her own voice, and the towering text within the book blurred into each other.¬†*You look horrible. You even reading that thing?*¬†

¬†¬†¬†Though her hair framed her face and rendered anything besides the dust that flew about underneath the firm haze of the light and the book itself invisible, she felt¬†*eyes*¬†burn holes through the side of her head. The whispers had become near-inaudible, sending courses of dread shooting through her veins‚Äîshe no longer heard them! Her auditory receptors began to ring; a maddeningly faint shriek, as silent as the whispers that grew ever fainter, slithering to the back of her head and pushed against the bone. With a rapid glance, Uzi made a half-hearted attempt at making sense of the crusted texts within the book, but her gaze was always pulled to the yellowed, crusted edges of the pages rather than the actual text.¬†*Raskolnikov‚Ä¶ Filthy‚Ä¶ Dirty‚Ä¶ Loathsome, loathsome!*¬†Of all the words that her mind swirled together, it just¬†*had*¬†to be those ones. Wasn‚Äôt that her textbook definition?¬†*Loathsome.*¬†Her optics screwed shut, and her expression twitched and spasmed in vain attempts to keep itself neutral.  
¬† Both her containment and reading had failed miserably, mainly due to her waning interest in anything at all reality had to offer. For her intellect,¬†*her*¬†mind, this was what she was rewarded with? Some shoddy peace-and-quiet area that carried possibly less than a hundred books compared to the thousands the humans had at their fingertips? What was this, a¬†*preschool?!*¬†All she had to do was make¬†*one call,*¬†send out only¬†*one*¬†message to the¬†*caporegime*¬†of the U-District‚ÄîEnzo Aiello‚Äîand these shit-for-brains whisperers would be erased off the face of the Earth come daybreak. The other part of her that argued Aiello would never spontaneously murder a couple of students over some indirect slur-hurling was swiftly suffocated. Uzi squirmed with a sensation that seemed dangerously close to a twisted delight as her mind enthusiastically drew up daydreams of her strangling them to death with her bare hands; or the¬†*Assassin's Special*¬†‚Äîa deuce-deuce handgun fully equipped with a silencer‚Äîshe had not grown out of its usage; after all, she had started off with the gun, though the drone had made the switch to an M9 just shy of a month ago. They'd be on their way across the metaphorical bridge within the hour. Ten, no, three button men would be at their doors. A simple house painting job, it would be over quickly.¬†*Ten buttons would be a waste,*¬†she observed. The grin Uzi had no idea had taken form quickly stretched itself into an almost ear-to-ear smile‚Äîif she had ears.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The dread that once nearly replaced her oilstream was enveloped by a giddy delight, and the teenage drone nearly slammed the book shut and shot up from her chair. Her thoughts melted into a jumble, and instead of jumping upwards she only found herself skimming through the pages with a speed of increasing ferocity. A feather-light tap on her shoulder jostled her upper body straight upward, and her exhaustion-dulled purple optics met bright neon pink ones. Uzi damn near slammed the book shut, yet the smile had been short lived‚Äîdisappeared long before the touch. The drone's blonde hair was styled into a messy shoulder-length ponytail and bangs that swung in an arc and covered most of her visor down to the top ridges of her oval optics. She was about the same height as Jade was‚Äîabout five-foot seven, two inches taller than Uzi herself‚Äîand wore a navy blue Polo sweater that had been somewhat tugged off her left shoulder and slightly baggy jeans to match. She leaned forward slightly, gesturing to Uzi's gloves. ‚ÄúYou ever take those off?‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†Uzi huffed. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She simply answered. She rubbed her gloved palm against the top of her hand without much conscious thought.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôcha readin‚Äô?‚Äù The other drone eyed the title. Her voice was a low hum, a stark contrast to her usual boisterous tone.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSome book. Didn't pay much attention to it.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThey let us have that?‚Äù She scoffed, though it was not a jeering one, rather a scoff that reeked of disbelief. ‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù She quickly shifted the subject. For all her bravado, Lizzy Barlowe knew when to shut up. She got to the point. ‚ÄúWhere were you? You just up and left last night.¬† Didn't even say why.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI said why. You just didn‚Äôt hear it.‚Äù Uzi's optics zipped to the closed book‚Äôs metallic black cover.¬† Had she come off too rough? Lizzy still held her typical smug expression‚Äîunreadable as always. Or was she just fronting? The other drone was particularly tight-lipped about her protection dues to the Family‚Äînearly every drone in U-District was under the wings of the Family, though they knew not who protected them, only that they did it well and charged them to speak not of even the masks they wore‚Äîand if it weren't for Uzi's upbringing within the Family, she wouldn't have known they even truly existed. Lizzy had been one of Uzi's first friends since her sophomore year in high-school, and one of the many people she‚Äîbe it directly or indirectly, depending on the circumstance‚Äîkept her actual life hidden away from. If they knew, then they'd be more of an unwitting target then they already were‚Äî¬†*if they decided to stick around.*¬†What made her even think they would?¬†*At least they‚Äôre protected,*¬†Uzi pointed out to herself in a vain attempt to calm herself down from the swirling broth of emotions that nearly filled her brain to the brim like a steaming mug of coffee.¬†*For now.*¬†It took nearly all of Uzi‚Äôs restraint not to growl out yet another string of self-rebuking once again.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYeah. I didn't.‚Äù She pressed, a clear invitation for Uzi to reiterate her reason for departing so early.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIt was gettin‚Äô late, and that murder freaked me the hell out.‚Äù Uzi shuddered, holding her mind back from digging up the images once again.

¬†¬†¬†Lizzy winced. The news of the thing had her looking over her shoulder every five seconds. She gestured for her friend to scoot over. Uzi nodded, shifting herself just enough to make comfortable space for Lizzy to sit. The drone flicked a strand of golden hair from her visor and took her seat, shifting into a relatively comfortable position within the rough wooden chair that were as long as church seats‚Äîwhich quickly gave her thigh a stabbing cramp that oscillated between a simple prickling that darted up and down her leg and the lick of a flame. Lizzy‚Äôs optics flitted between Uzi, who was now flipping through the book yet again in an attempt to pick up where she left off, and the desk. The purple-haired girl smelled¬†*off*¬†, that was certain. The faintest scent of strawberries, something fruity, and‚Ä¶¬†*blood.*¬†Was it blood? It barely carried its typical odor, a far fainter hint than the perfume she wore‚Äîbut she could just about pick up the acrid, copper-like smell. Lizzy Barlowe was an anatomy major with a clear, albeit restricted future in the medical field given her species, a fate set in stone she still held anger towards. Anger that was slowly melting away. At the very least she'd make it to pathology. But she knew what blood smelled like all too well from sterile labs from which the smell clung and wafted off the very walls of it to the point of nausea, mainly due to the grisly dissection of various lifeless specimens that would unfold within its walls. The horrible, cloying stench would stick to her clothes like leeches and be the sole cause of weeks of vigorous washing. It was a smell she never really accustomed herself to, a miasma that made her stomach do resentful flips and kept her up most nights.

¬†¬†¬†Her mind flashed back to Uzi hurrying out the door the previous night, muttering something she barely caught a word of to Gryffin before leaving both bewildered drones and vanishing into the night in a rush neither had seen out of Uzi before.

I (35f) got the flu with a 104¬∞ fever and felt like crap. It's a really, really nasty flu  the kind where you almost can't stand up and make it to the toilet because everything hurts and you're dizzy. My partner Dan (39m) cared for me, brought me soup, meds and was really sweet. I really don't want to make this sound as if he wouldn't care about me, he's awesome. 

In the evening I was so exhausted from all the pain I finally felt I could sleep and told him I want to sleep in as long as possible, best would be I could stay in bed until noon, when I could go to the doctor. He said okay and he planned to sleep in the office anyway. For me, that was that. 

Dan and I own a big dog. Usually Dan takes the morning walks since I have to be at work at 7am and he has flexible hours. So he usually sleeps until 7.30 - 8, takes out the dog and goes to work at 9. I take the afternoon walk since I get home around 2pm and we share the evenings. 

Morning comes and I wake up briefly and hear Dan getting up at 7:45. He gets himself a coffee and starts watching youtube videos. I fall asleep again. At 8:45am Dan wakes me up and says: ""I have to leave for work, don't forget to walk and feed the dog, he's already crying so better get up."" I just stared at him dumbfounded. I was still in so much pain, could feel the fever in my body and I was soaking wet from sweating like crazy all night. The thought of getting out of bed, taking a rushed shower and walking our big dog was just too much. I asked him why in the world he didn't walk him like always and he was like ""I thought since you're home all day, you cover the walks."" which is what we do when one of us has PTO and the other has to work. 

I just told him I was too sick to do this right now and just walk him. Dan was pissed but did what I asked him to. Now we disagree who was the one in the wrong. He says just because I am sick I can't behave like a baby. I say he should have just taken on his usual responsibility and not treat my sickness like I took some vacation days.

There was only the calm rustle of the batches of evergreen outside, and the occasional faint call of the fast ferries‚Äîbarely audible, as opposed to the ear-splitting blaring she had the displeasure of hearing last night. For a time. It was deafeningly quiet in the Victorian-looking library, save for the occasional venom-laced whisperings Uzi was smart enough to infer was specifically tuned for her to at least faintly overhear. It was always her. It was always something about¬†*her*¬†specifically, wasn‚Äôt it? The drone leaned against the walnut chair, bracing her book against the miniature parapet of the same material that intelligently held two sticks of light within it. But where the humans were seated looked as if they had been a replica of a Renaissance-era painting down to the most minutiae detail. Uzi‚Äôs finger twitched. Dimmed lights cradled in what looked to be gothic-style ornate mini-balconies hung low‚Äîbut not too low‚Äîfrom the stained-glass paneled ceiling as far as the eye could see, even somewhat stretching into the drone area, held in place only by a single sturdy chain of the same color. But there was a maddening difference in quality, the hexagonal cradles looked flimsy within her area, as if they were made of simple plastics and not of steel. Or was it simply cheap tin that hung above her? The surrounding architecture within the human area still retained its sprawling Victorian look, but Uzi thought not of spending minutes ogling its design in spite of its ethereal presence. She registered its somewhat celestially detailed appearance‚Äîas if the hands of God himself had painstakingly chiseled the stone from which it was made‚Äîbut at the same time it had halfly faded from her memory. But of course, they had separated that area from her kind, and she was forced to relocate to a small reading room‚Äîthe Family hadn‚Äôt done any ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù because that would be far too high-profile for their liking. Typical, but the teen understood. A drone in a human-only area with no authority doing jackshit about it would raise more than a couple eyebrows‚Äî¬†*and fists,*¬†she warily observed. Maybe some¬†*Strega*¬†would soothe her nerves. No, the herbal liqueur always gave her a throbbing headache that persisted as a faint throb far into the night. Truth be told, she preferred Irish guinness. Most nights, it cleared her mind with a far better dispelling force than the trickle of rain could be.

¬†¬†¬†It barely held a quarter of the books Uzi¬†*knew*¬†to be available in such a gargantuan library as this. There were no holo-guides that they could customize to guide them to the book they wished to read‚Äîif it was available to them. The room she was sent to was more of a child‚Äôs closet than an actual room worthy of being part of a library as this. She was barred from reading any sort of cult classics because it was of topics ‚Äúonly comprehensible to the human mind.‚Äù The simple finger-twitching quickly transformed into a rageful shaking that was quick to grow uncontrollable. Papers were dead last on her problem ladder. If only she could ever manage to get her hands on any one of them‚Ä¶ Her thoughts stopped there. It had simply collapsed, like a weakened rope snapping after being made to hold over sixty tons worth of cargo, sending it all tumbling into the raging depths of the ocean. Uzi bristled while she rubbed her thumb against the lukewarm pages she had skimmed through, her gaze flickering between the old-fashioned text and the dully sparkling material of her gloves. Anger was ambushed by sorrow, and like the thudding of a rifle‚Äôs bullets against flesh it was wrent to shreds. It was a fitting punishment for such a soulless creature as her. There it was again‚Äîthe¬†*pewt*¬†of a silenced M9, dried blood recoloring what was once a spongy yet coarse black. Every time she blinked, she saw it in increasing detail. Dots of yellowish green and squirming maggots that only moved in centimeters joined the image, though they feasted upon no corpse.¬†*Look at you,*¬†she chided. Uzi winced at her own voice, and the towering text within the book blurred into each other.¬†*You look horrible. You even reading that thing?*¬†

¬†¬†¬†Though her hair framed her face and rendered anything besides the dust that flew about underneath the firm haze of the light and the book itself invisible, she felt¬†*eyes*¬†burn holes through the side of her head. The whispers had become near-inaudible, sending courses of dread shooting through her veins‚Äîshe no longer heard them! Her auditory receptors began to ring; a maddeningly faint shriek, as silent as the whispers that grew ever fainter, slithering to the back of her head and pushed against the bone. With a rapid glance, Uzi made a half-hearted attempt at making sense of the crusted texts within the book, but her gaze was always pulled to the yellowed, crusted edges of the pages rather than the actual text.¬†*Raskolnikov‚Ä¶ Filthy‚Ä¶ Dirty‚Ä¶ Loathsome, loathsome!*¬†Of all the words that her mind swirled together, it just¬†*had*¬†to be those ones. Wasn‚Äôt that her textbook definition?¬†*Loathsome.*¬†Her optics screwed shut, and her expression twitched and spasmed in vain attempts to keep itself neutral.  
¬† Both her containment and reading had failed miserably, mainly due to her waning interest in anything at all reality had to offer. For her intellect,¬†*her*¬†mind, this was what she was rewarded with? Some shoddy peace-and-quiet area that carried possibly less than a hundred books compared to the thousands the humans had at their fingertips? What was this, a¬†*preschool?!*¬†All she had to do was make¬†*one call,*¬†send out only¬†*one*¬†message to the¬†*caporegime*¬†of the U-District‚ÄîEnzo Aiello‚Äîand these shit-for-brains whisperers would be erased off the face of the Earth come daybreak. The other part of her that argued Aiello would never spontaneously murder a couple of students over some indirect slur-hurling was swiftly suffocated. Uzi squirmed with a sensation that seemed dangerously close to a twisted delight as her mind enthusiastically drew up daydreams of her strangling them to death with her bare hands; or the¬†*Assassin's Special*¬†‚Äîa deuce-deuce handgun fully equipped with a silencer‚Äîshe had not grown out of its usage; after all, she had started off with the gun, though the drone had made the switch to an M9 just shy of a month ago. They'd be on their way across the metaphorical bridge within the hour. Ten, no, three button men would be at their doors. A simple house painting job, it would be over quickly.¬†*Ten buttons would be a waste,*¬†she observed. The grin Uzi had no idea had taken form quickly stretched itself into an almost ear-to-ear smile‚Äîif she had ears.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The dread that once nearly replaced her oilstream was enveloped by a giddy delight, and the teenage drone nearly slammed the book shut and shot up from her chair. Her thoughts melted into a jumble, and instead of jumping upwards she only found herself skimming through the pages with a speed of increasing ferocity. A feather-light tap on her shoulder jostled her upper body straight upward, and her exhaustion-dulled purple optics met bright neon pink ones. Uzi damn near slammed the book shut, yet the smile had been short lived‚Äîdisappeared long before the touch. The drone's blonde hair was styled into a messy shoulder-length ponytail and bangs that swung in an arc and covered most of her visor down to the top ridges of her oval optics. She was about the same height as Jade was‚Äîabout five-foot seven, two inches taller than Uzi herself‚Äîand wore a navy blue Polo sweater that had been somewhat tugged off her left shoulder and slightly baggy jeans to match. She leaned forward slightly, gesturing to Uzi's gloves. ‚ÄúYou ever take those off?‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†¬†Uzi huffed. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She simply answered. She rubbed her gloved palm against the top of her hand without much conscious thought.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôcha readin‚Äô?‚Äù The other drone eyed the title. Her voice was a low hum, a stark contrast to her usual boisterous tone.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúSome book. Didn't pay much attention to it.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThey let us have that?‚Äù She scoffed, though it was not a jeering one, rather a scoff that reeked of disbelief. ‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù She quickly shifted the subject. For all her bravado, Lizzy Barlowe knew when to shut up. She got to the point. ‚ÄúWhere were you? You just up and left last night.¬† Didn't even say why.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI said why. You just didn‚Äôt hear it.‚Äù Uzi's optics zipped to the closed book‚Äôs metallic black cover.¬† Had she come off too rough? Lizzy still held her typical smug expression‚Äîunreadable as always. Or was she just fronting? The other drone was particularly tight-lipped about her protection dues to the Family‚Äînearly every drone in U-District was under the wings of the Family, though they knew not who protected them, only that they did it well and charged them to speak not of even the masks they wore‚Äîand if it weren't for Uzi's upbringing within the Family, she wouldn't have known they even truly existed. Lizzy had been one of Uzi's first friends since her sophomore year in high-school, and one of the many people she‚Äîbe it directly or indirectly, depending on the circumstance‚Äîkept her actual life hidden away from. If they knew, then they'd be more of an unwitting target then they already were‚Äî¬†*if they decided to stick around.*¬†What made her even think they would?¬†*At least they‚Äôre protected,*¬†Uzi pointed out to herself in a vain attempt to calm herself down from the swirling broth of emotions that nearly filled her brain to the brim like a steaming mug of coffee.¬†*For now.*¬†It took nearly all of Uzi‚Äôs restraint not to growl out yet another string of self-rebuking once again.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYeah. I didn't.‚Äù She pressed, a clear invitation for Uzi to reiterate her reason for departing so early.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIt was gettin‚Äô late, and that murder freaked me the hell out.‚Äù Uzi shuddered, holding her mind back from digging up the images once again.

¬†¬†¬†Lizzy winced. The news of the thing had her looking over her shoulder every five seconds. She gestured for her friend to scoot over. Uzi nodded, shifting herself just enough to make comfortable space for Lizzy to sit. The drone flicked a strand of golden hair from her visor and took her seat, shifting into a relatively comfortable position within the rough wooden chair that were as long as church seats‚Äîwhich quickly gave her thigh a stabbing cramp that oscillated between a simple prickling that darted up and down her leg and the lick of a flame. Lizzy‚Äôs optics flitted between Uzi, who was now flipping through the book yet again in an attempt to pick up where she left off, and the desk. The purple-haired girl smelled¬†*off*¬†, that was certain. The faintest scent of strawberries, something fruity, and‚Ä¶¬†*blood.*¬†Was it blood? It barely carried its typical odor, a far fainter hint than the perfume she wore‚Äîbut she could just about pick up the acrid, copper-like smell. Lizzy Barlowe was an anatomy major with a clear, albeit restricted future in the medical field given her species, a fate set in stone she still held anger towards. Anger that was slowly melting away. At the very least she'd make it to pathology. But she knew what blood smelled like all too well from sterile labs from which the smell clung and wafted off the very walls of it to the point of nausea, mainly due to the grisly dissection of various lifeless specimens that would unfold within its walls. The horrible, cloying stench would stick to her clothes like leeches and be the sole cause of weeks of vigorous washing. It was a smell she never really accustomed herself to, a miasma that made her stomach do resentful flips and kept her up most nights.

¬†¬†¬†Her mind flashed back to Uzi hurrying out the door the previous night, muttering something she barely caught a word of to Gryffin before leaving both bewildered drones and vanishing into the night in a rush neither had seen out of Uzi before. Originally, they were quick to write the incident off as simply her father calling her to do something‚Äîthey knew that her adoptive father was none other than the philanthropist Aurelio Rossi, the sole reason why nobody except for the particularly bull-headed picked physical fights with her or even looked her way‚Äîbut the excuse had run as hollow as drywall now.

1ic5ae9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ic5ae9,Disneyland Paris,"TLDR - personal experience from taking my M3 SR+ (2021) from the midlands to Disneyland Paris and back. Very straightforward and easy to use in France. Superchargers were easy to find and often quiet (the closest to Disneyland was VERY busy) but the hotel had chargers for free! 

Long version
Just returned from a week long trip to Disneyland Paris. Took my M3 from near Nottingham. The trip was very smooth and was travelling in convoy with a friend in a diesel Audi A4. Before leaving I found a few threads about taking Tesla‚Äôs abroad but thought I would give my experience for anyone else thinking of making the journey. 

The uk side all was normal. I was taking the Le Shuttle (apparently no longer called Eurotunnel ü§î). I input the destination and let the car do the working out. I did set the arrival energy at 30% to ensure I had enough to at least get started into France before having to stop but I needn‚Äôt have worried! Stopped at South Mimms with plenty of stalls available (travelling very early on a Sunday morning). Once arrived at the security for Le Shuttle and given the boarding number I noticed I was on a ‚ÄòLarge‚Äô category vehicle. There are chargers at the terminal building which was handy to be able to top up while waiting for the call to proceed! This allowed me to get over with more energy and only requiring one stop in France. When boarding the train I was put on a single decker carriage which is slightly wider (less risk of curbing the wheels üëçüèª). 

Once on the train and in park I found it interesting the car seemed to lose signal immediately! The journey was fine and nice to have the air con on as opposed to petrol cars which need the engine running. Upon disembarking the train the signal picked up and the navigation jumped us over to France. A little pop up box confirmed that the lights had been adjusted for driving on the right hand side of the road. This is something I hadn‚Äôt been sure of before leaving but was a nice touch to put my mind at ease. 

Using the car in France was interesting. I put the destination in (and again added to the arrival energy as was planning on being potentially without a charge point for several days!). The Enhanced Autopilot seemed to struggle for a while with French motorways not recognising the second lane as an overtaking lane and required me to manually overtake (not the end of the world and did get better after 20-30 mins). I used the display settings to change the speed to kilometres and found this very simple to do. 

The route took me down the A16. Using tolls in Europe can be difficult as on the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô side of the car but managed to get close enough to get tickets without much fuss. The supercharger on the way to Paris was adequate I would say (Aire De La Baie De Somme), it did the job but maybe not the most modern of clean facility. 

Once we arrived at Disneyland (Sequoia Lodge Hotel) I unloaded the car and went to find a parking space. There appeared be be very ample charging ports, many being used already, but as I was unaware of if these were paid or reserved I used a ‚Äònormal‚Äô parking spot. At check in I enquired and was politely informed they are free to use and not reserved. I went out and moved the car into one and plugged in to allow me to charge up. They were about 11-12kw chargers so not too bad and as there were plenty I left my car plugged in for the duration of the stay. (As advised to do with my LFP battery!)

Being able to be at full charge on leaving to come home was a great start to the journey. The car took us up the A1/A26 on the way back stopping at Roye Supercharger. This is a much more modern site with plenty of stalls available (again a Sunday morning journey) and a handy hub room with restrooms, a coffee machine, RFID fridges and Mario kart for the kids to play on! (See pics). We were able to top the car up after arrival at the Calais terminal enough to get back to South Mimms and then on to home. When in the port I did swap the car back to MPH and noticed that the speed limit was 19 miles an hour. Not sure if leaving a Tesla in MPH it adjusted the speed limit of the road to the relevant speed in MPH. Please let me know if it does! Also interestingly on the train back we were able to have signal almost the entire journey and use the theatre to watch a Disney film! When leaving the train another pop up reminded me the lights had once again adjusted to the correct angle for the left hand side of the road.

So for anyone looking for any information about the journey to or from Paris. Making the journey was just as easy as my previous experience in ICE cars. The downside of having to stop more often for charge is offset by nice stops like Roye and also the cost. The superchargers in France SEEMED cheaper and the total trip was about ¬£40 in charge on superchargers and ¬£5 at home to get back up to 100% compared to my friends ‚Äònearly 1.75 tanks of fuel‚Äô at about ¬£80-90 a tank! 

Hope this helps someone and at the very least I enjoyed the trip and looking forward to the next one üòÅüëçüèª",31,1738081222.0,TeslaUK,8,0.97,False

Public Areas: Black markers - main entrance, spa, pools (Coraluz, Brisal), dining (Mercado, Palmerio, Cayao), shopping.

Accommodations:¬†

Rooms, Casitas, Suites (Red): Ocean-view, luxurious, with some having plunge pools.

Residences, Villas, Estates (Green): Private, ocean-view, community feel.

Oceanfront Villas (Orange): Ultimate luxury, beach access, includes the Three-Bedroom Presidential Villa.

**Accommodations:**

The rooms at Four Seasons Cabo Del Sol blend chic Mexican design with modern Spanish architecture, featuring panoramic sliding doors for an indoor-outdoor experience. Entry-level rooms in La Casona start at 850 sq ft, while Casitas and Suites can go up to 2,000 sq ft, with ground-floor accommodations featuring private plunge pools and upper-level units featuring connecting options creating two bedrooms. Rooms come equipped with modern amenities including charging pads, bedside controls, an iPad for services, Diptyque toiletries, Nespresso machines, and Fellow tea kettles.

The Suites are family-friendly with separate living/bed areas and an extra bathroom (shower only), offering ocean or oceanfront views. Plunge pool suites have a shelf seat for child safety. Exclusive to suites: Dyson hair dryers. For families traveling with an infant, choose plunge pool suites for ground-floor access, stroller ease, and crib-friendly closets, plus shaded outdoor areas for naps. The plunge pool adds the convenience of relaxing by the water while your baby naps, all within the comforts of your Suite. Not only did the handy bar sink serve up cocktails, it also doubled as a bottle-washing station - talk about a multitasking hero! Lastly, in terms of privacy, I'd rate it as semi-private. Each accommodation features outdoor drapes, but with units nearby, you'll have neighbors either above or below and next door. Ground-level rooms offer easy access to lawn games, sports, and the beach, yet the shared use of the lawn by guests and staff significantly reduces privacy.

**Villas:**

(One Bedroom) Oceanfront Villas: These villas are best for couples, offering space and exclusivity, but not suited for families due to limited room and no connecting options; the master bedroom/bathroom access is via the closet.

The Three-Bedroom Presidential Villa is ideal for families or groups, with private ocean access, a modern kitchen, three luxurious bedrooms, and terraces boasting three plunge pools, a large pool, and ocean views.

**Villa & Residence Rentals (formerly known as Private Retreats):**

Villas and Residences offer 2 to 5 bedrooms with private pools for sunset viewing, a villa host, a private chef, pre-stocked groceries, and tequila/mezcal tastings for an upscale experience.

**Pools:**

Smart buttons around pools provide easy access to services, enhancing the exclusive experience.

Brisal: Adult-only, serene, perfect for laps or relaxation.

Coraluz: Family-friendly with a splash pad, beach-like design making it ideal for little ones.

Lap Pool: Near the gym for fitness-focused guests.

Cabanas at Brisal and Coraluz are spacious offering couches, TVs, and refreshments.¬†

**Beach:**

Whether the Four Seasons Cabo del Sol beach is suitable for swimming is subjective. IMO, with rocks, reefs, and unpredictable currents, it‚Äôs more tailored for experienced swimmers and those eager to engage in adventurous water sports (there‚Äôs a nearby boat dock ideal for jumping diving, and snorkeling.) Baja 360 water activity staff at the resort can take guests out for guided snorkel tours, stand-up paddle boarding sessions, and surf lessons. If you prefer a calm, swimmable beach, consider Santa Maria Bay at Montage Los Cabos instead.

**Golf:**

Golf lovers will enjoy Cabo Del Sol's two courses: the exclusive Cove Club (ex-Ocean Course) with its scenic, challenging play, and the Desert Course, accessible to Four Seasons guests. Access to Cove Club is restricted to members or property buyers.

**Spa & Wellness:**

The Abrazo del Luna treatment at the Tierra Mar Spa was a game-changer‚Ä¶ a 3-hour escape with a quartz and chakra massage plus a lymphatic facial. Absolute bliss for any mom needing 'me-time'.¬†

Also, Lina did my nails with Dazzle Dry polish - dries in 5 mins, no UV, and lasts 14+ days. I'm officially done with gels and acrylics!!

The fitness center is top-notch too, with new Hoist machines and cool classes like Energetic Breathing. Definitely recommended for anyone looking to pamper themselves or get a good workout in.

**Dining:**

The dining here is a culinary trip with 8 spots blending Mexican with global cuisines. Breakfast at Palmerio is a feast with fresh fruits, pastries, and an awesome Waffle Bar - not just for kids! If you prefer √† la carte, there are smoothies, eggs benedict, and chilaquiles. Mercado is a must for grab n go coffee, pastries, and gelato. And Cayao? It's a splurge-worthy experience with Peruvian-Japanese fusion; their edamame and flaming coffee are highlights. Each meal course feels like an event.

**Family Services:**

This place is a dream for families. Their ""Papalote"" program keeps kids 4-12 entertained, while Baja 360¬∞ is perfect for tweens and teens. Parents get some downtime thanks to babysitting services. The little ones have Stokke high chairs for meals, organic bath stuff, distilled water, a diaper genie, and cribs.¬†

**My itinerary:**

Tailored for our family with a 7-month-old, we stayed within Four Seasons Cabo Del Sol, using in-room dining for half our stay. Limited our adventure for baby's first trip, but definitely recommend trying Acre and Flora Farm if you can!

Also note that restaurant hours and days of operation differ. Coraluz does not serve dinner from Tuesday to Thursday, Palmerio is closed for dinner on Sundays, and both Cayao and Sora are not open on Mondays.

The Four Seasons Cabo del Sol concierge email is [concierge.cabosanlucas@fourseasons.com](mailto:concierge.cabosanlucas@fourseasons.com).

Example of my trip itinerary:

Day 1: Cabana at Coraluz (family pool) and dinner at Coraluz

Day 2: Abrazo del Luna treatment at Tierra Mar Spa and dinner at Palmerio

Day 3: Tee time at Cabo del Sol golf course and dinner at Cayao

Day 4: Cabana at Brisal (adult pool) and Energetic Breathing at Tierra Mar Spa

Day 5: Tee time at Cabo del Sol golf course and dinner at Sora

Day 6: Photography experience

Happy to answer any questions about my stay!

Not to be rude, but CN is short, and he has a lot of hangups about that. He also has a lot of hangups about his appearance and other ‚Äúinadequacies.‚Äù I‚Äôll leave it at that.

As such, CN never had much luck with women. He dated two women before me, but he was so ashamed of his body, supposedly, that he rarely wanted sex, so they dumped him.

He feels awful about himself, refuses to get help, and this situation has caused him to have weird, creepy, and inappropriate relationships with women. Here are some examples.

CN is addicted to work and started working tons of hours at a grocery store when he turned 15. He befriended two women who were in their mid-30s. These women were unhappy in their marriages and hung out with him a lot at diners. Sorry, when I was 35, I was not hanging out with a high schooler. That, to me, is weird, but I think he loved the attention.

CN befriends and white-knights lonely, needy, vulnerable single moms at his jobs, although he ‚Äúhates kids.‚Äù Sometimes, he‚Äôll fixate on women whose marriages are in crisis. He starts to behave like a husband/boyfriend, minus the sex, because, well, he doesn‚Äôt like to get naked or have anyone see his dick. He‚Äôll take their tearful calls, texts at all hours, do tons of free work for them, give them rides, give them money, etc. However, once they find an actual boyfriend, the new boyfriend is like, ‚ÄúWhat is this creepy, old married guy doing sniffing around you constantly?‚Äù The ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with CN ends, and he walks around all sad like he‚Äôs been dumped.

I won‚Äôt give the endless details about this, because I have written about this so much in the past, but CN treats his sister like a wife/life partner. She is prioritized over me, his actual wife, including weekly, 8+-hour-long dinner dates that can last until 2 am.

Most recently, he became obsessed with a single mom subordinate at work. They would go out 1:1. He would take her out for coffee, lunches, celebratory dinners for her many achievements, go to sporting events together, confide in her about confidential information regarding their coworkers, etc. He would Google stalk her countless times a day.

CN does not do friendships with men because he ‚Äúgets along better with women.‚Äù I think the truth is, he is intimidated by most men.

CN has told me over and over again that I am overreacting, and these are just friendships. But I do not know any married men who constantly have these ‚Äújust a friend!‚Äù-ships with women. His behaviors are just subtle enough that outsiders think he‚Äôs just being a swell guy. But? They don‚Äôt realize that he rushes to help his harem while leaving me holding the bag, struggling, alone, and abandoned 99% of the time.",3,1738081139.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

We have had no issues in our relationship so far.

Recently, my father received a very serious health update about his cancer coming back.

Last time we met up, I shared this update with him. I was direct, explaining that things weren‚Äôt looking good and that I‚Äôd likely be under a lot of stress in the coming months as my family figured out next steps. I also let him know I wasn‚Äôt sure what kind of support I might need from him but promised to communicate when I did.

In response to my news, he said ‚ÄúIf you need comfort, my penis is willing and ready."" He then shifted gears by commenting on a guy in the coffee shop wearing a turtleneck and leather jacket, saying he could never pull off that look. A moment later, he circled back, apologized for changing the subject during a serious conversation, and asked if I had more to share. I had already said everything I needed to, so the conversation ended with him reiterating that he‚Äôs here for me, both physically and emotionally.

As we've gotten to know each other, I have never mentioned that I gravitate towards sex for comfort.

While I'm open to helping someone learn how to be supportive during my difficult time, there seems to be a baseline disconnect between our ideas on what comfort looks like when someone is going through something serious.

I am confused on his thought process here, any thoughts on how to approach a conversation with him about this?",89,1738080935.0,relationship_advice,211,0.84,False
