This coming Christmas I got my brother in law for secret Santa which one of his requests was a small espresso machine, that was a small problem as I know nothing about espressos and don’t want to just get a rinky dink set up. I’m willing to go over $180 just a bit if it means a better machine. I looked over the internet and some reddits and I found recommendations for DeLonghi EPC 3630 and EPC 3420 as well as the CasaBrews 3700 essential Compact 20 bar machine or aeropress? (Which I think is like half for espresso??) , I don’t know which way is up or how they even compare 😅. He loves coffee, has his own nice grinder and specialty beans with special coffee brewing contraptions so I would like to get him something to last a while till he buys a better machine that is somewhat past beginner friendly all while keeping in budget if possible! please any help will be appreciated!!

12-09-25 I walked the Green Mile. 

At least it seemed kinda like that, practically terrified, walking down the long hallway of the HCA Houston Healthcare Medical Center to the pre-op center. 

There was no John Coffee to grab my groin with his magical healing power like he did for Tom Hanks in the movie, but there was, what believe to be the next best thing. Dr Johnathan Clavell.

Dr Clavell, in person is just like you see in his videos, very charismatic and personable. The kind of guy you would invite to your family backyard BBQ. He looks you right in the eyes and assures you that “I will treat your penis as if it were my own” and he means it, or more importantly, makes you believe it.

I won’t go into all the pre-op and surgical stuff that we’ve all read over and over here, but I’ll concentrate on things that may not have been touched on. Like traveling from out of town.

My wife accompanied me and we booked our flights through Expedia. I’m not sure that was a good move, but I’ll spare you the details.

Following the video advice from Dr Clavell’s video on traveling, and the maps and information his scheduler provided, we booked our stay at the ZaZa Hotel in Huston for 5 nights. The hotel is expensive, but it’s only 3 blocks from the Hospital, and I figured the wife would enjoy it.

We were supposed to arrive Saturday night, but American Airlines screwed up our flight and we didn’t arrive till Sunday. My surgery was scheduled for Tuesday. Still plenty of time to seek out some Texas BBQ before I have to start fasting.

Monday morning I walked to the HCA Houston Healthcare Center, an easy 3 blocks, and did all my pre screening, blood test and EKG. Afterward the wife and I went to the excellent Huston Museum Of Natural Science. Looking at the mummy exhibit there I couldn’t help but think about what my dick would look like tomorrow. 

Tuesday we walked to the hospital. My anxiety level was lower than I expected. This has been a months long,agonizing, stressful decision. I admit the thought crossed my mind, even after they started the IV, that it wasn’t too late to chicken out. 

Dr Clavell came by and was very confident and reassuring. He assured me that the AMS CX product was a good choice, even though I got the impression he favors the Titan. When I asked his what he thought about the LGX, he said that it was “more for guy’s that are like this”, and held out his pinky finger.

When I woke up, there was relatively no pain. The nerve block Dr Clavell uses works. 

I of course had the mummy wrap with my new penis partially inflated and sticking straight out pointing upward about 2 o’clock. The shaft was numb. The head kinda purple colored and brushed. The most discomfort was in my abdomen, low on my right side, where I guess the reservoir was placed. Still it only felt maybe like I was sore from doing sit-ups .

Dr Clavell came by and fist bumped me and said things went well. I had no trouble urinating, and was discharged with very little fanfare, walked out of the hospital and WALKED BACK TO THE HOTEL! 

I kept the little urinal they gave me at the hospital. With your dick sticking straight out it’s a necessity. I’m having trouble with dribbling, because you can’t really shake to dew off your Lilly with it all bandaged up. I learned by reading here, about putting a baby sock on it to help with the sensitivity, so I came prepared with a couple pairs. Then I figured out that I can stuff a piece of tissue into the toe of the baby sock before I slide on and the collects any dribble. Problem solved.

Today I’m holding up in the room, very little discomfort. When sitting in a chair it helps to have a rolled up hand towel under my nuts. Tylenol only so far for pain. No ice…yet.

It’s hard to sleep because I’m normally a stomach sleeper and THAT AIN’T HAPPENING, so, on my side with a big ZaZa Hotel pillow between my legs it is.

Tomorrow I’ll take a shower and remove the mummy wrap. I’m not looking forward to the trip back home with a connecting flight in Atlanta, but at least it’s Delta and not American Airlines…",1,1765462361.0,penileimplants,0,1.0,False

1pjyfu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pjyfu4/thinking_of_death/,Thinking of death,"18 male. I feel like i can't take everything anymore. It just feels like too much. Preparing for college next fall. Having to do adult things. Everything just sucks. I definitely have depression, anxiety, eating disorder. I havent been diagnosed but its there. The only thing keeping me together is music, and making lyrics/music. I wish I could be better. But a part of me wants to be in the depression because I like it. I started cutting my thighs around Thanksgiving. Thats the first time I self harmed. But now that its been a couple weeks. I have gotten used to it. And the wounds aren't deep i just do it when I really feel like and something bad happens where I cant express anything in a certain way. In the past couple weeks ive been thinking of death. And now its active. I remember listening to a song about one of the old members using cough syrup to die and it made me think of using that but that will probably be painful. I dont really know what to do. I wont have a girlfriend. I wont be able to tell my future kids I love them. I feel worthless and hopeless. And I keep laughing about it. My parents get mad because of my attitude and I keep smiling and laughing and cant stop. I was talking to these girls in my class about I might have eating disorder with anorexia and how I make myself throw up and she said ""you dont have anorexia thats just making yourself throw up"" and no one believes me. People say everything will be alright but I think its lies. Life gets worse and harder. I feel i cant breath sometimes. I think i got my first small panic attack yesterday. I felt I was in a whirlwind. I got sweaty. I felt like crying. I had to breath slowly and take a seat/hold something. I think of suicide/death all the time. And i just feel so heavy. Something is there. I wake up every morning at around 3 am and drink coffee to suppress my appetite. And barely eat. ",1,1765462214.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I moved to the UK from Europe back in 2018 with my wife. We didn't really have a profession, but did have experience working in corporate environments in different industries. We had help from a relative who said they'd be willing to rent us a room for £300 for a few months. First thing we did before moving to the UK was to make Monzo accounts, because back then it was probably the only bank that had advanced expenses breakdowns. Strangely - we were able to open the accounts without physically being here. We also ordered pre-paid sims so we could get the ball rolling with job applications as soon as we arrived. Took us about 2 weeks to find jobs that we liked. Salaries were about £25k and £22k. We moved to a £625 flat 2 months later. We started looking at buying a small flat as soon as we managed to save enough for a 10% deposit, but the banks required 3 years worth of proof of address, so we had to wait a bit. In 2021 we had £35k in savings. We spent several months looking for a house that required no investment in repairs, as we knew it won't be our forever home. We bought a small detached house on a rough-ish street for 190k. The house had the largest garden on the street (about 10x10 meters), so I invested about £2000 in it, mostly in raised beds and plants because this was the only way to raise it's value. Between 2028 and 2024 we had a few raises, then changed jobs. Eventually got to £39k and £35k. We sold the house in 2025 for £232k, and made a £265k offer on a house that was being sold for £275k. It was a 4 bed large Edwardian terrace with 2 living rooms, a conservatory and garage, with a huge garded (and I mean 4 time the size of the house). It had the original slate roof, and it was leaking in several places. The ceiling was damaged in several rooms. It hadn't been refurbished since the 80s, so we knew it would require significant investment. Luckily- by that time we managed to save another £50k. We borrowed and additional amount from the bank, used our equity, and bought the house for £250k after successfuly negotiating the price with the help of a level 3 survey. We moved in January 2025 and until now I spent about £60k on a new roof, new kitchen, new bathroo., plastering, new floors, tools and furniture. Most furniture was from antique shops or eBay. Lots of DIY, which allowed me to save £20k probably. We're almost finished, and planning on starting saving again. We have a 3yo toddler, but don't feel like our expenses have increased much.


Some nrs:

Total take home pay: £4780 (plus a early bonus of about £3000)

Mortgage: £890

Gas & electric: £200

Insurance: £40
Phones: £20

Broadband: £20

Council tax: £140

Public transport + Ubers: 
£100 on average

Nursery: £100

Groceries: £600

Eating out: £0 to £150



All in, we managed to save about £80k between 2018 and 2024 as foreigners, with normal office jobs. In the first 2 years I made quite a bit of money by opening new bank accounts and getting the bonus. At one point we probably had 10 accounts, and were moving money from one to another constantly to get the bonuses.

Now that I'm finished with the refurb, I expect I'll be able to save £2000 per month on average. 

How do we manage this? We rarely it out, and prefer to eat at home. We buy most our clothing from TK Maxx. We don't have a car, and we specifically chose a location that's within walking distance from a tram station. We haven't been to a holiday abroad in years but we do go to places like Lake District regularly. We don't spend money on electronic and gadgets. I bought a 65inch TV from ebay a few years ago and it's still going strong. Used speakers on ebay, used amp, SIM only contracts. No expensive furniture: Ikea and antique shops only. I'm allergic to alcohol, so we don't go to drinks. We might go out for a coffee with friends sometimes, but more than often we invite them to our home.

This might all change if one of us gets made redundant, but hopefully by then we'll have some savings, which will allow us to survive while searching for new jobs. I've also recently started looking into buying critical illness and income protection insurance. It would cost us about £100.

❤️Ingredients

Biscuits:  
🍓5 tablespoon golden flaxseed meal  
1 ½ cup almond flour  
🍒2 tablespoon baking powder  
2 tablespoon milk powder  
1 teaspoon xanthan gum  
4 tablespoon butter cold  
Salt to taste  
½ tablespoon butter melted  
2 large egg  
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar  
Filling:  
6 large egg  
3 tablespoon heavy cream  
Salt to taste  
1 cup red bell pepper diced  
1 cup portobello mushrooms diced  
½ cup yellow onion diced  
3 ounce feta cheese  
Instructions

Measure out and prepare all of the ingredients. We'll start by making the biscuit mixture and then the filling. Preheat oven to 350F.  
Place the golden flaxseed meal in a coffee grinder to make it really fine.  
In a bowl, combine the fine golden flaxseed meal, almond flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, milk powder, and salt. Whisk it all together.  
Smash in the butter with your clean fingers until it all seems to be incorporated together.

Make sure you give your best shot, and never, ever succumb to cheating. The OSI Police are in full force during this critical period, and you know it, through the Reddit threads that you would occasionally find how onerous these threats could be.

**You Are Not Alone & You'll Get Through This.** Know that you are not alone.

We all go through ups and downs and have tests or projects that don't go as planned. Never fear as bright days are ahead of you. Utilize this thread if you're feeling down and or want someone to talk to. We are all in this together and we're here for you and one another.

**There is a lot more to life than work and school.** Health, family, & friends always come first.

School is not the most important thing in life. Remember, Bs (and intentionally sometimes even Cs) give you degrees. Further, there is no shame in quitting OMSCS.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life’s not just a race.** Go at your pace. 

This is especially more so now when the track we are in keeps on changing. Your future self will thank yourself for it. And when all is done, post a new thread and celebrate with us.

Love, r/OMSCS Mod Team (posing themselves as bots, but hey, we wrote and then update it up!)

I’ve built a startup, taught thousands, and now spend my days between IIM campus , gym therapy, and chasing the perfect cold coffee(sugary). But lately, what I’ve been missing most is a space to listen really listen to someone’s story as it unfolds.

I value empathy over ego, growth over gossip, and craft over clout. What matters more than credentials is curiosity — the ability to show up, stay present, and mean what you say.

I’d love to meet an intellectually curious woman (21+) who believes in communication, commitment, and small acts of consistency. Someone who doesn’t rush depth but values it when it arrives. The kind of person who shares ideas freely, challenges gently, and expects emotional reciprocity, not performance.

What we can do: walk through a market or museum, exchange top-five reads, or just talk about what’s been occupying your head lately- art, politics, design, sport, love, the way people change.

Boundaries: respect and safety first; no pressure or pretense.

If this resonates, tell me something you’ve recently learned about yourself or the world. I’ll listen — fully. And if we vibe, coffee’s on me.",1,1765461515.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
1pjy5wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1pjy5wg/coffee_runs_late_night_conversations_and_more/,"Coffee Runs, Late Night Conversations and more. Looking for long term friends!","I’ve lived enough to know that the city I live in is loud and alive, and somehow still lonely when you don’t have your “call at 11pm to rant and laugh” people. So here I am again, a little amused and a lot hopeful, trying one more time to find some nice company and good friends!

If you’re the kind who overshares a little, replies with more than “hey,” and thinks friendships are slow love stories without romance, we’ll get along just fine. I've broken this down in by bullet points just so it's easier to read for y'all. I used to write long walls of text before and that probably seems daunting so this time around, I'm doing something different.

**Quick‑access menu (for the skimmers)**

* **About me, one breath version:** food nerd, balcony‑garden meddler, Indian‑indie/Bowie stan, PS5 co‑op enjoyer, letter writer, night owl, golden‑retriever energy with occasional introvert reboot.
* **What I want:** **long‑term** friends; if you’re nearby, I’m up for hanging out in person (chai/coffee walks, co‑working). If not, consistent online + weekend calls works too.

And, The long, honest version of me for the folks who like to read and well get to know me more in the process of course!

* **Kitchen first, therapy second.** I cook when life gets messy (and when it doesn’t). Expect dessert bribes, savoury experiments, and unsolicited photos of too‑proud loaves. If you want recipes, I’ll send them of course, along with the three ways I ruined it before it worked. I've tried to create sourdough starters 5 times now, the 6th attempt is sitting atop my fridge and I can share a piece of it if this one survives!
* **Plants & hydroponic experiments.** My balcony is a slow motion saga of random plants and an assortment of seeds that may or may not become anything, and me cheering at new leaves like it’s the World Cup. I love nursery runs and swapping cuttings.
* **Music & media.** Indian indie (Prateek Kuhad, Aditi Ramesh, Ritviz, Aarifah), Bowie forever, dipping into jazz like a polite guest. I keep too many playlists and will absolutely title one after you. Headphones: WH‑1000XM3 for travel, AirPods day‑to‑day.
* **Books & writing.** Lit fic to whatever steals my heart; Ocean Vuong, Elif Shafak, Proust when I’m feeling brave. I write letters, to my future self, to friends, sometimes to the versions of people I miss. If you write, I’m your most enthusiastic reader. (If this point is interesting to you, I've written something at the end)
* **Games & tech.** PS5 seeking co‑op buddies. Loved God of War: Ragnarok, story‑heavy/open worlds (RDR2, Horizon), and I’ll happily jump into new titles if we’re laughing on voice. Currently playing ""Clair Obscur: Expedition 33""
* **Outdoorsy… ish.** Road trips, easy hikes, the dream of **Bali Pass** I keep threatening to do. I like lakes, can’t swim well, and still end up fishing (catch‑and‑release mostly).
* **Podcasts.** True crime for road trips, plus finance/books/movies/music pods for everyday.
* **Creativity & collections.** Learning digital art on Procreate on the iPad I spent a month's salary on that I regret I don't use as much. I hoard stamps and boarding passes like tiny anchors to memory.
* **Vibe.** Mostly **golden‑retriever energy** (I will hype you up), occasionally need quiet to recharge. I don’t disappear forever but if I go silent, I return and pick up right where we left off. I’ve had brushes with anxiety and blues; I try to be the friend I needed then: consistent, kind, and honest.

**What I’m looking for (and what I’m not)**

* **Friends of course** I’m here for friendship - the kind that grows and stays.
* **Adults (18+) of any age.** No age cap; be a good human who wants to build something that lasts.
* **Nearby? Let’s actually meet.** If you’re in/around Bangalore, I love **daily** or near‑daily micro‑hangs (20–60 min): chai walks, co‑working, grocery runs, café reading, quick game night. If we click, we can plan bigger things - board‑game café, hike, road trip or even a cook off.
* **Not nearby? Still yes.** Consistent online friends welcome: async chats + a weekly/biweekly voice call; co‑watching shows or co‑working online.
* **Vices & boundaries.** I don’t judge your choices; just don’t push them on me or anyone else. Kindness over coolness.
* **Conversation > “hey.”** Oversharers are my people. Tell me about the random thing you learned at 2am; I’ll match your energy.

**Things we could actually do (menu of small beginnings)**

* Chai/Coffee + walk + playlist swap (you get to judge my taste; I get to pretend not to mind).
* Co‑working sessions (mics off, lo‑fi on, meme and rants about colleagues breaks allowed).
* PS5 co‑op (I’m chill on voice, zero toxicity, happy to learn your game).
* Bookshop crawl + café reading + “pick a book for each other.”
* Plant‑swap Saturday + nursery visit + trying not to adopt twelve new pots.
* Potluck dinner where one dish is “nailed it?” in the truest sense.
* Planning a trek/drive we actually do. Bonus points if we pack terrible jokes.

**Why you might like being friends with me**

* I show up. I keep my word. I don’t ghost.
* I’m a great vent‑listener and decent advice‑giver (only if you want it).
* I’ll celebrate your tiny wins like they’re grand finales.
* If you’re having a 4am wobble, I’m more likely to be awake than asleep.
* I write little notes for people I care about. (Consent first; nobody needs a surprise novella.)
* If we share a city, I’m the “I’ll be there in 20” kind of friend, minus the shovel joke. (…unless you think it’s funny. Then, *kidding!*)

**How to message me (that way, we can skip the awkward opener)**

Send me a DM with:

1. **Where you are** (Bangalore neighborhood, country, city or time zone).
2. **One thing you’re obsessed with lately** (song, book, game, recipe, plant, weird fact).
3. **One tiny plan for the next 2 weeks** you’d do with me (chai walk, co‑work, plant swap, PS5 session, bookshop crawl, podcast rec exchange).
4. **Where you prefer to chat** (any platform of your choice). We’ll start on Reddit and move elsewhere if we both feel comfy. First meets are **public and easy** (coffee/park/café).

**A few true things (hard life truths I guess) I’ve learned (the part where I sound like my letters)**

Loving people and letting them go has happened to me, too. Grief sits beside joy at the same table; friendship keeps pulling out chairs for both. I’ve written vows I never got to say and eulogies I never wanted to write; I’ve also baked ridiculous brownies for ordinary Tuesdays. I still believe in the small rituals that make a life - shared playlists, inside jokes, the way someone texts “reached?” after you get home. If you’re the kind of person who thinks that ordinary days deserve witnesses, we should fit.

**Finally the TL;DR part:**  
Bangalore guy with food/plant/music/books/games/outdoors energy, **seeking long‑term friends**. If you’re nearby, we can definitely meet up in person whenever you're comfortable. If you’re not, let’s be consistent online pals. Kindness, effortful conversation, and no ghosting. Send a real intro and a small plan; I’ll bring cinnamon (the spice), memes, and a playlist with your name on it.

And finally as promised above:

**A small letter to the friend I haven’t met yet (meaning you!)**

I wonder what you’re listening to right now. Maybe a song you’re shy to admit you really like, the kind that makes the bus window look like a music video. I wonder if your days are loud or quiet, if your nights stretch too long, if you’ve also stared at your phone crafting a hello you never send. If we do this right, we’ll trade playlists and recipes, swap cuttings from stubborn plants, co‑work in comfortable silence, and make Tuesdays feel a little less like Tuesdays. I’ll bring cinnamon for the coffee; you bring the story of the last time you laughed so hard you snorted.

Looking for long term friends!","I’ve lived enough Bangalore days to know the city is loud and alive, and somehow still lonely when you don’t have your “call at 11pm to rant and laugh” people. So here I am again, a little amused and a lot hopeful, trying one more time to find some nice company and good friends!

If you’re the kind who overshares a little, replies with more than “hey,” and thinks friendships are slow love stories without romance, we’ll get along just fine. I've broken this down in by bullet points just so it's easier to read for y'all. I used to write long walls of text before and that probably seems daunting so this time around, I'm doing something different.

**Quick‑access menu (for the skimmers)**

* **About me, one breath version:** food nerd, balcony‑garden meddler, Indian‑indie/Bowie stan, PS5 co‑op enjoyer, letter writer, night owl, golden‑retriever energy with occasional introvert reboot.
* **What I want:** **long‑term** friends; if you’re nearby, I’m up for hanging out in person (chai/coffee walks, co‑working). If not, consistent online + weekend calls works too.

And, The long, honest version of me for the folks who like to read and well get to know me more in the process of course!

* **Kitchen first, therapy second.** I cook when life gets messy (and when it doesn’t). Expect dessert bribes, savoury experiments, and unsolicited photos of too‑proud loaves. If you want recipes, I’ll send them of course, along with the three ways I ruined it before it worked. I've tried to create sourdough starters 5 times now, the 6th attempt is sitting atop my fridge and I can share a piece of it if this one survives!
* **Plants & hydroponic experiments.** My balcony is a slow motion saga of random plants and an assortment of seeds that may or may not become anything, and me cheering at new leaves like it’s the World Cup. I love nursery runs and swapping cuttings.
* **Music & media.** Indian indie (Prateek Kuhad, Aditi Ramesh, Ritviz, Aarifah), Bowie forever, dipping into jazz like a polite guest. I keep too many playlists and will absolutely title one after you. Headphones: WH‑1000XM3 for travel, AirPods day‑to‑day.
* **Books & writing.** Lit fic to whatever steals my heart; Ocean Vuong, Elif Shafak, Proust when I’m feeling brave. I write letters, to my future self, to friends, sometimes to the versions of people I miss. If you write, I’m your most enthusiastic reader. (If this point is interesting to you, I've written something at the end)
* **Games & tech.** PS5 seeking co‑op buddies. Loved God of War: Ragnarok, story‑heavy/open worlds (RDR2, Horizon), and I’ll happily jump into new titles if we’re laughing on voice. Currently playing ""Clair Obscur: Expedition 33""
* **Outdoorsy… ish.** Road trips, easy hikes, the dream of **Bali Pass** I keep threatening to do. I like lakes, can’t swim well, and still end up fishing (catch‑and‑release mostly).
* **Podcasts.** True crime for road trips, plus finance/books/movies/music pods for everyday.
* **Creativity & collections.** Learning digital art on Procreate on the iPad I spent a month's salary on that I regret I don't use as much. I hoard stamps and boarding passes like tiny anchors to memory.
* **Vibe.** Mostly **golden‑retriever energy** (I will hype you up), occasionally need quiet to recharge. I don’t disappear forever but if I go silent, I return and pick up right where we left off. I’ve had brushes with anxiety and blues; I try to be the friend I needed then: consistent, kind, and honest.

1pjxzda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1pjxzda/god_told_me_i_was_going_to_die/,God told me I was going to die,"Hello, I’ve encountered some experiences reading the bible that I would be helpful as someone who experiences vivid visions.

Since I was young, I knew many things without rational thought. I would receive these beautiful visions that often came true — sort of like a premonition of sorts. For example, before I really grew in my faith, God showed me a vision of someone painting a mosaic in the temple of the Lord, and while I wasn’t sure what it meant, it felt like God was truly speaking to me

Sure enough, the next day I encountered several different mosaics—the first in the opening chapters of Esther, and then another on a friend’s coffee table at their place. Before that, I had never seen one in person.

When I asked God for clarity about if my visions were true and coming from the holy spirit, he called me to read the story of Daniel. I had never heard of the story before despite its popular references in Christian culture and much to my surprise, it accounts his experience receiving Gods visions.

What’s weighing me now is the fact that these visions are growing quite dark. I’m afraid, and recently had a vision, or what really felt like a message from God that I would end up taking my life and it would be God honouring in some way. To go to heaven sooner

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with a health condition that I feel like I’m losing to. Perhaps it’s part of the plan, because most days are anguish and pain. I’m starting to think that the Lord doesn’t want me to suffer on the planet the way I am and to come back to him, but only when it’s time.

1pjxy78,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pjxy78/i_finally_bought_a_new_macbook_for_my_writing/,I finally bought a new MacBook for my writing,"I finally did it. I bought a new MacBook just for my writing. For a long time I was using random old devices, shared screens, slow systems that took forever to open anything. Every time I sat down to write, something would lag, freeze, or distract me. It sounds small, but after a while it really started to kill my mood. I kept telling myself, “If I’m not even taking my writing setup seriously, how will I ever take my writing seriously?”

I’m not some professional writer. I’m a hobbyist. I write when I can, in between regular life stuff. I don’t have some big book deal or a huge newsletter. Most of my writing lives in notes apps, drafts, and half-finished ideas. But even then, I started feeling like I needed a space, a tool, that actually made me want to sit down and type. That’s where this whole “I need a good laptop” thought really started.

The weird thing is, the decision took me way longer than it should have. I kept going back and forth. Do I really deserve a nice laptop if I’m not a “real writer”? What if I buy it and then barely write? What if it’s just another expensive toy? I overthought it a lot, like most people do with anything that costs more than a cheap impulse purchase. But the more I thought about it, the more one thing became clear: writing actually makes me feel good. It’s one of the few things that feels like mine.

So after a lot of scrolling, comparing, and watching random reviews, I finally went for the MacBook.

The first time I opened it and heard that little startup chime, it felt kind of silly how happy I was. It’s just a laptop, right? But when I opened a clean document and my fingers started typing on that new keyboard, it felt different. The screen was brighter, the typing felt smoother, and the whole experience felt… intentional. Like, okay, this is my thing now. Not just me forcing words into a slow, half-broken machine.

One of my favorite parts so far is how fast everything opens. No waiting, no freezing, no “not responding” pop-ups. It sounds basic, but there’s something nice about being able to catch a thought and type it immediately, before it disappears. I don’t have to fight with the device to keep up with my brain. I just open it, start writing, and let everything pour out, good or bad.

I also like that it feels portable in a way my old setup never did. I can sit at a desk, on the couch, at a coffee shop, or even in bed when I’m being lazy but still want to feel like I did something creative that day. There’s something kind of romantic about opening a laptop in a quiet corner, putting on some music, and just writing whatever comes out. Even if nobody else ever reads it.

I’m still not an expert. Half the time I’m learning shortcuts by accident. I’m definitely not using all the “powerful features” this thing has. I opened some fancy app the other day, stared at it for ten seconds, and closed it again. But that’s okay. I didn’t buy it to become a tech genius. I bought it so I could write more, and maybe write a little better, because I’m not constantly annoyed by my setup.

The cool thing is, having this laptop kind of makes me feel accountable to myself. Like, if I invested in this, I should at least show up and try. Not every day will be perfect. Some days I’ll just type a few lines and give up. Some days I’ll probably stare at the blinking cursor longer than I actually write. But it still feels like a step. A small one, but a real one.

I know there are people out there who say you don’t need a nice laptop or the perfect setup to write, and they’re right. You can write on anything. Phone, old PC, notebook, whatever. But for me, this is less about the laptop and more about the mental shift. It’s me saying to myself, “Hey, this matters to you. Let’s treat it like it matters.”

So yeah, I finally bought a MacBook for my writing. I’m still figuring things out, still finding my style, still trying to be less shy about calling myself a writer, even if it’s just a hobby. I don’t know where it will lead. Maybe nowhere big. Maybe somewhere cool. But right now, I’m just happy to open a blank page, hear the keys clicking, and know that I actually gave myself a real chance to try.",12,1765460913.0,offmychest,5,0.93,False
1pjxxpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingStories/comments/1pjxxpg/i_finally_bought_a_new_macbook_for_my_writing/,I finally bought a new MacBook for my writing,"I finally did it. I bought a new MacBook just for my writing. For a long time I was using random old devices, shared screens, slow systems that took forever to open anything. Every time I sat down to write, something would lag, freeze, or distract me. It sounds small, but after a while it really started to kill my mood. I kept telling myself, “If I’m not even taking my writing setup seriously, how will I ever take my writing seriously?”

I’m not some professional writer. I’m a hobbyist. I write when I can, in between regular life stuff. I don’t have some big book deal or a huge newsletter. Most of my writing lives in notes apps, drafts, and half-finished ideas. But even then, I started feeling like I needed a space, a tool, that actually made me want to sit down and type. That’s where this whole “I need a good laptop” thought really started.

The weird thing is, the decision took me way longer than it should have. I kept going back and forth. Do I really deserve a nice laptop if I’m not a “real writer”? What if I buy it and then barely write? What if it’s just another expensive toy? I overthought it a lot, like most people do with anything that costs more than a cheap impulse purchase. But the more I thought about it, the more one thing became clear: writing actually makes me feel good. It’s one of the few things that feels like mine.

So after a lot of scrolling, comparing, and watching random reviews, I finally went for the MacBook.

The first time I opened it and heard that little startup chime, it felt kind of silly how happy I was. It’s just a laptop, right? But when I opened a clean document and my fingers started typing on that new keyboard, it felt different. The screen was brighter, the typing felt smoother, and the whole experience felt… intentional. Like, okay, this is my thing now. Not just me forcing words into a slow, half-broken machine.

One of my favorite parts so far is how fast everything opens. No waiting, no freezing, no “not responding” pop-ups. It sounds basic, but there’s something nice about being able to catch a thought and type it immediately, before it disappears. I don’t have to fight with the device to keep up with my brain. I just open it, start writing, and let everything pour out, good or bad.

I also like that it feels portable in a way my old setup never did. I can sit at a desk, on the couch, at a coffee shop, or even in bed when I’m being lazy but still want to feel like I did something creative that day.

i just want ONE place on my phone where i can talk to other girls my age (or any age tbh) without getting creepy DMs, marriage proposals, “send bobs” or random guys calling me “babygirl” two seconds after i say hi.

i’m not here for:
- honest conversations at 3 am when life feels heavy  
- actual advice about college, career, family pressure, periods, toxic friends, literally anything  
- tips on how you survived your first heartbreak, first job, first salary, first time living alone  
- someone to hype me up when i post a selfie without 50 men commenting on my body  
- venting without being told “you’re overreacting” or “not all men”

i don’t want romance. i don’t want followers. i don’t want to be someone’s “future wife” because i said i like cold coffee.

i just want friends. real, safe, girl-only friendships. the kind where we can be messy, cry, laugh, roast each other, share reels, exchange notes, recommend therapists, talk about salary packages, send voice notes at 2 am saying “girl i messed up today” and actually get understood.

every app right now feels like walking into a room full of strangers who only want one thing. even LinkedIn isn’t safe anymore (yes i’ve been proposed to on LINKEDIN after posting about an internship).

so please… if you’re a girl reading this and you also feel lonely in a world full of notifications… comment anything. a heart, a “same”, your favourite song right now, your go-to comfort food… anything. i’ll reply to every single one because i genuinely just want to talk to you.

and if you’re an app developer (or know one), please please please make a women-only app with proper verification. i will pay for it. i will cry happy tears. i will be your first 1000 users.

Of all the places where the note could be left in that big house, the intruder would leave it at that exact spot.

3 options:

1. LHP would have been so stupid as to leave (or instruct someone else to leave) the note at their usual spot for notes.
2. Someone wanted to frame LHP in particular.
3. Someone had observed this behavior and decided the spot based on that.

If I understand correctly, the notebook was near the stairs, so perhaps the staìrs could be a natural location to choose, just like LHP and Patsy had also chosen it at some point. But how plausible is this? Wouldn't the intruder have been more inclined to leave it near a coffee machine, for example?

This detail about the case feels somewhat ""off"", and it seems most plausible that the supposed placement and finding of the note on that exact spot was *somehow* connected to the familiar note-leaving habits of that household. For me, this is actually the most compelling piece of info to support a RDI theory, although that's not what I'm here ultimately trying to say with any certainty.",0,1765460691.0,JonBenet,2,0.5,False
1pjxv9s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjxv9s,How do you teach dogs what they can and can’t play with?,"My dog (he’s a northern dog rescue, the shelter had shepherd mix as his breed and he’s about 45lbs) just turned 1 recently, and I thought this would improve with time but it doesn’t seem so. (I apologize in advance as English isn’t my first language)

He has a basket full of toys he can just pull out anytime, in the basket there’s chews, tugs, toys, yak, everything. We walk him 4 times a day for about 15 to 30mins each time + most days he plays with other dogs at the park (not a dog park, just with the neighbours dogs that we know are safe and responsible). We always keep cardboard for him to destroy because we know he loves to do so and he doesn’t eat it. Yet, he still rips his beds covers (he’s chewed through 3 covers enough that I couldn’t repair them and ripped the edges of a total of 5 bed covers), we still need to have the entryway blocked or he’ll grab our shoes (we forgot to put the barrier the other day and he grabbed one of my boot), he’s chewing his toy basket (this one can be understandable, but then how am I supposed to store his toys?), he’s also chewed the coffee tables corners, made a hole in the ottoman (I’m covering it with a blanket for now), can’t leave any blankets or throw pillows around or he’ll chew through them too. When we say no or stop he will stop for a moment but then he eventually always goes back. It feels like he thinks everything is on the table for him. He is crate trained and we never leave him outside of his crate when we leave home. I’ve had 3 dogs in my adult life but he is my first puppy. 

I guess I’m wondering how do you teach your dog what he can and can’t play with? If it were only one ‘’category’’ of things that he loved to destroy it would be much easier but it feels like it’s just everything and feels really overwhelming. ",2,1765460681.0,DogAdvice,10,1.0,False
1pjxv1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pjxv1l/the_greatest_day_of_your_life/,The Greatest Day of your Life,"The alarm didn’t just ring; it *materialized*. It was not a physical sound wave but a low, pervasive hum that resonated in the fillings of Elara’s teeth, a bespoke frequency chosen by the High School Certificate Board to ensure maximum, non-jarring wakefulness. It was 05:30. The earliest hour of the year, yet somehow also the most significant.

Elara lay perfectly still beneath the crisp, cool sheet, trying to regulate the frantic rhythm of her heart. *Thud-thump. Thud-thump.* It sounded less like a vital organ and more like a desperate drummer trying to signal an imminent invasion. She counted the seconds: one, two, three… If she could achieve a heart rate below eighty, she was allowed to move. She failed. She gave up counting and simply sat up, the air instantly colder, heavier, charged with the gravity of the day.

The silence in the house was profound, a deliberate quiet that was louder than any noise. Her parents, Eleanor and Marcus, were already awake, their presence a palpable, nervous energy leaking from the kitchen below. They were attempting to manufacture an atmosphere of 'normalcy,' a task they were failing at miserably. The scent of coffee, usually a comforting, dark aroma, today smelled metallic, like anxiety itself had been brewed.

Elara dragged herself to the window. Outside, the world was tinted a bruised indigo, the final, fading moments of night. Today, the world was split into two camps: those taking the HSC, and everyone else. She felt a profound, isolating solidarity with every other pale, jittery ghost stirring in the city’s early light, all preparing for the same definitive moment.

She chose her outfit with painstaking ritual: the same faded, comfortable sweatshirt she wore for all her final study sessions and a pair of dark, unassuming trousers. They were not lucky clothes, just familiar ones—a tiny, controllable patch of routine in a universe that felt suddenly chaotic. As she pulled the sweatshirt over her head, she caught her reflection in the darkened glass. Her eyes were wide, the pupils slightly dilated, making her look younger and more terrified than she felt capable of handling.

Descending the stairs, she held her breath, not wanting to disturb the fragile peace. The kitchen, however, was a tableau of highly strung domesticity. Eleanor stood at the counter, rigid, measuring out oatmeal with the precision of a chemist. Marcus was pacing the perimeter of the room, his hands clasped behind his back, pretending to examine the houseplant collection.

“Morning, sweetheart,” Eleanor said, her voice pitched half an octave too high. It was a cheerful, morning-show voice designed to dispel tension, but it only served to spotlight it. “I made your favorite—steel-cut oats, just a little honey, perfect slow-burn fuel.”

“Morning, Mom, Dad.” Elara slid into her seat, which had a freshly laundered cushion. Another attempt at comfort. “You don’t have to whisper, you know.”

Marcus stopped his pacing instantly. “Whisper? I’m not whispering. I’m just… modulating my voice to the ambient noise level.” He cleared his throat unnecessarily. “Are you ready? Feeling good? I mean, you’ve put in the work. No one can say you haven’t put in the work.”

“I’m fine,” Elara lied, pushing the oatmeal around the bowl. “I’m ready for it to be over.”

This statement hung in the air, heavy and true. The HSC was not just an exam; it was the culmination of years of national struggle, the government’s desperate attempt to reverse a decade of intellectual decline.

Elara thought back to the documentary clips they had shown in mandatory civics class. The ‘Certificate Crisis,’ as the media had dubbed it, began subtly around the mid-2020s. The old university entrance exams, once revered, had become predictable. They had become less about demonstrating knowledge and critical thinking, and more about optimized test-taking strategies. The entire education system had inadvertently devolved into a massive, expensive machine for training students to pass a static test. And even worse: the test was written by AI and answered by AI.

The consequences were disastrous: university enrollment soared, but the quality of graduates plummeted. Corporations complained they were hiring people with perfect scores who couldn't synthesize data or solve novel problems. The national innovation index dropped steadily, and the country faced an embarrassing intellectual deficit.

The political outcry was deafening, forcing a radical, unprecedented solution: the creation of the High School Certificate. It wasn't just a new test; it was an entirely new philosophical approach to assessment, backed by a massive, custom-built computational intelligence.

The system was called *Aethel*.

The government poured trillions into its development, promising an exam that was ""uncheatable, un-hackable, and un-gameable."" The core principle of the HSC, they drilled into every student, was that it wasn't about *what* you knew, but *how* you thought.

“Aethel will monitor your cognitive process,” the Education Minister had proclaimed in a widely circulated public service announcement. “It adapts the difficulty, the problem type, and the required solution paths *in real-time*. It doesn’t just mark the final answer; it marks the *journey*. If you show true, deep understanding, the AI will recognize it, even if your final arithmetic is off by a decimal point. If you use rote memorization, it will detect the lack of synthetic engagement and fail you, regardless of a correct answer.”

The most terrifying element was the secrecy. The old exams had massive public archives, predictable structures, and known topics. The HSC was a blank slate. The subject matter was rumored to be broad, covering everything from quantum mechanics concepts to comparative historical philosophy, but the exact format, question types, and weighting were unknowable. All Elara knew was that in the sterile testing cubicle, she would face a screen, and across the network, the sprawling consciousness of Aethel would be watching, waiting to judge her intellectual merit.

This was why the anxiety was so physical. It was not the fear of failing a standard test; it was the terror of being judged and categorized by an impartial, inhuman mind—a gatekeeper that cared nothing for effort, only for innate, demonstrable capacity.

“Eat, Elara. Seriously, you need the energy,” Eleanor urged, snapping Elara back to the present.

Elara managed a few spoonfuls. It felt like gravel in her stomach, but she forced it down.

“Your father is pulling the car around now,” Eleanor continued, her eyes darting everywhere but Elara’s face. She finally stepped closer, pulling Elara into a tight, scented hug. “Remember what Mrs. Peterson told you. Deep breaths. Read the prompt twice. And don’t second-guess your gut feeling. Your gut feeling is smarter than you think.”

“Thanks, Mom.” Elara returned the hug, savoring the familiar comfort of her mother’s strength.

Marcus appeared in the doorway, jingling the car keys—too loudly, too fast. “Alright, alright, showtime! Let’s get you to the Colossus. Early is good. Early is calm.”

The ‘Colossus’ was the local name for the Regional Examination Center, a massive, brutalist complex of polished grey concrete and shadowed glass built specifically for the HSC. It sat in the heart of the city’s academic district, a constant, intimidating reminder of the educational hierarchy.

The drive was agonizingly slow, not due to traffic, but because Marcus drove as if the car contained nitroglycerin, braking gently, accelerating with a whisper. He kept the radio off, but the silence was equally deafening.

“Remember that time you built that particle accelerator out of cardboard and kitchen foil?” Marcus said suddenly, desperate to fill the void. He sounded almost frantic. “You were seven! You have that creativity, Elara. That’s what they want. They want the seven-year-old who didn’t follow the manual.”

“Dad, that’s… sweet, but I think they want a little more than foil today,” Elara said, offering a weak smile.

“No, no, I mean it! That’s the point of Aethel, isn’t it?” he insisted, stopping unnecessarily early at a red light. “They want the lateral thinking. They want the genuine problem-solver. All the rote memorizers, all the test-passers—they’ve already been filtered out by the AI’s preliminary assessment algorithms. You are here because they know you can *think*.”

His nervous encouragement was a shield, protecting them both from the raw fear of failure. If Elara failed the HSC, her path to the top-tier universities would be permanently blocked, forcing her into a lower-tier vocational track, a future that, in their family’s eyes, felt like a collapse.

As they drew closer to the center, the streets began to fill with students, all moving with the same hesitant, forward momentum. They looked uniform: dark clothes, backpacks held too tightly, faces pale and focused inward. It was a silent procession of dread and potential.

The architecture of the Colossus suddenly loomed into view. It was truly immense, a modern fortress designed to convey the immense value and scarcity of the knowledge it was guarding. The exterior walls were made of a non-reflective black basalt, absorbing the morning light and giving the structure a sense of oppressive weight.

The sheer security was staggering. High-definition sensor domes were mounted at every corner. Sleek, silent drones hovered lazily above the entry plaza, watching, recording. This was not a normal test; it was a high-stakes, nationally crucial operation.

Marcus pulled the car into the designated drop-off zone, his knuckles white against the steering wheel.

“This is it,” he breathed, turning off the engine.

Eleanor reached into the back seat and retrieved a clear plastic pouch containing Elara’s government-issued biometric identification card and a single HB pencil, the only items permitted inside.

“I’m so proud of you, Elara. Whatever happens, we are so proud,” Eleanor said, her voice finally cracking slightly. This raw honesty was more fortifying than all the forced cheerfulness.

“I know,” Elara said, her throat tightening. She needed to get out before she started crying, before the magnitude of her parents’ hopes became too heavy to carry.

She stepped out into the crisp, cold air. The plaza was buzzing with muted noise—the shuffling of hundreds of feet, the low, professional murmur of the uniformed guards, and the distant, synthesized voice of the Center’s check-in system repeating instructions.

She turned back to the car. Marcus gave her a final, strained nod. Eleanor pressed her hand over her heart and offered a shaky thumbs-up. The car pulled away slowly, leaving her alone on the edge of the vast plaza.

Elara joined the stream of students moving toward the main entrance. Here, the final checkpoint was located. It consisted of a series of individual processing stations, each topped by a low-slung, matte-black console.

When it was her turn, a guard—impassive, professional—gestured her forward.

“Identification card on the scanner. Left palm on the plate.”

Elara obeyed. The console emitted a faint, low green light. A synthesized, almost melodic voice confirmed: “*Elara Vance. Candidate ID 7349. Authentication complete.*”

She felt a momentary flicker of relief. She had passed the identity check. Now came the true gatekeeper.

As she moved past the guard and into the final airlock leading to the main hall, she looked up. High above the entrance arch, embedded in the black basalt, was a single, discreet metal plaque. It wasn't a motivational quote or an institutional seal. It was simply the name of the system, engraved in clean, minimalist font:

**Aethel.** *The High School Certificate: Assessment by Computational Intelligence.*

She took a final, shuddering breath, tasting the cold, metallic air of the examination hall. The hall itself was cavernous, a perfect matrix of individual cubicles, separated by low, sound-dampening walls. Each cubicle contained a table covered by a dark cloth, the camera, and a chair. There were no papers, no clock, no external distractions. Just the candidate and the AI.

Elara didn't wait for the guards or the synthesized voice to give her permission. She stood up instantly, her legs shaky but propelled by a sudden, dizzying rush of adrenaline and disbelief. Fifteen minutes. The whole ordeal, the years of preparation, the trillions spent on Aethel, had culminated in a contest that lasted a quarter of an hour. A contest she won !

She was the first one out.

Bursting through the doors and into the plaza, Elara felt the cool morning wind hit her face, and she started running. She didn't just run; she bounced, she jumped, a wild, unrestrained explosion of relief.

Marcus and Eleanor were still at the edge of the drop-off zone, having refused to leave. They were huddled together, looking utterly wretched. When they saw Elara, their faces transitioned instantly from grey anxiety to brilliant, disbelieving joy.

“Elara! What—what happened? Did you fail ?” Eleanor cried, rushing forward.

“I passed, Mom, Dad. I did it. I got the Certificate.”

“Passed? But how? What did they ask you? ”

Elara grinned, her wide eyes reflecting the vast, dark glass of the Colossus behind her. She lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, leaning in close to her parents.

“They asked me to out-concentrate a goldfish.”

The first week I almost forgot about, so that was definitely my fault. I got him a box of Ferrero Rocher and a huge bag of Albanese gummies bears. The second week, I gave him a santa mug and a $15 Starbucks gift card. This past week, I got him a pair of pajama bottoms. Next week will be the final gift.

One of my closer coworkers talks to him more often. She told me that he said this person giving him gifts does not know him at all. Mind you, we work in a company with over 80+ employees. He said he doesn’t drink coffee, so what would he use a mug for? He compared my gifts to what he was giving somebody else and told her that he bought his Secret Santa a pair of UGGs for the final gift. He said what I gave him was cheap and wrong.  

I’ve been debating not giving him anything next week at all. I’m also a full-time student along with this full-time job, pay all my own bills, so my time and money is tight as it is. I wanted to participate because I like a lot of people that I work with and the spending range was reasonable to me. It made me feel horrible that he spoke about receiving my gifts this way. I don’t know if I’m being sensitive or if he is just ungrateful.

What should I do?

1pjxt4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingStories/comments/1pjxt4q/should_i_buy_an_ipad_for_my_2yearold_daughter/,Should I buy an iPad for my 2-year-old daughter?,"I’ve been asking myself this question for a while now. Everywhere I look, parents are handing their kids tablets. Some say it helps with learning. Some say it keeps their toddler busy long enough for them to finish a cup of coffee. And then there are people who act like giving a 2-year-old an iPad is the end of the world. So honestly, it’s hard to know what’s right.

My daughter just turned two, and she’s at that stage where she wants to touch everything, copy everything, and climb on everything that looks even slightly climbable. She’s curious about phones, remotes, anything with buttons. So part of me thinks an iPad might actually be fun for her. She could tap around, watch little educational videos, maybe play those simple toddler games people talk about.

But at the same time, she’s still so little. She still laughs at bubbles and dogs and random noises. She still brings me books to read again and again, like it’s the first time every time. Do I really want to introduce a screen into her world when she’s already so happy just being… a kid?

And let’s be honest, screens are addictive. Even for adults. I tell myself I’ll check my phone for two minutes and suddenly ten minutes disappear. So I can’t pretend like she wouldn’t get hooked too. She has her whole life to learn about apps and videos. What’s the hurry?

But then I also understand the practical side. Parenting gets chaotic. Sometimes you just need a moment to cook, or shower, or reply to a message without a toddler trying to climb your leg. In those moments, an iPad can feel like a superhero. I can picture her sitting quietly with a cartoon while I get something done for once.

So I’ve been trying to figure out what the real question is. Is it “Should a two-year-old use an iPad?”  
Or is it “How do I want her to use screens as she grows up?”

If I do get one, I’d want it to be something she uses in small bits. Not something that replaces playtime or books. Not something that becomes the automatic solution whenever she’s bored. Just a tool. Something we use intentionally. Something fun but not the center of her world.

And if I decide not to get one yet, that’s okay too. She’s perfectly entertained with simple stuff right now. She loves crayons, blocks, pulling tissues out of a box (still working on that one), running around the house, and following us everywhere like a little shadow.

That’s probably why the decision feels so tricky. I don’t want to hold her back, but I also don’t want to rush her.

Maybe the answer is somewhere in the middle. Not “yes right now,” not “no forever.” Just… when it feels right. With limits. With intention. With balance.

For now, I’m still thinking. Maybe I’ll wait. Maybe I’ll buy one with a super-cute toddler case and use it gently. Either way, I just want her to grow without losing the little magic she has in these simple moments.",2,1765460517.0,AmazingStories,2,1.0,False

You can't cry about being broke while spending $8 on coffee and $15 in delivery fees multiple times a week. The math isn't mathing.

I'm not saying inflation isn't real. It is. Everything costs more. But some people are making it worse by bleeding money on convenience and then acting like the economy is the only problem.

If you're genuinely struggling why are you paying someone to deliver food you could pick up yourself? Why are you buying premium coffee daily instead of making it at home?

Are we actually struggling, or are we just bad with money and blaming external factors?

Because I know people who make way less and manage fine because they're not hemorrhaging cash on unnecessary expenses. And I know people who make decent money and claim they're broke because they can't budget.

And like most people - who doesn't love a story about themselves? That thought stuck with me while playing around with ChatGPT and other AI tools last year. 

My nieces and nephews are obsessed with bedtime stories, and I kept thinking: what if I could generate stories where THEY are the main character? But what really hooked me was making it interactive. Father and son on an adventure, and they have to decide - do we take the mountain path or cross the river? The story continues based on what they pick. 

I've had this idea for years. But no spare time, 10 years in data engineering but no app dev experience, so it sat on my mental shelf collecting dust next to all my other ""someday"" app ideas. Then I discovered Claude. Not trying to promote anything - but when I first used it about a year ago, something clicked. All those shelved ideas suddenly felt... possible? 

Started building in May. 8 months later, 100s of hours of planning, coding, refactoring, mass cups of coffee, and way too many ""why am I doing this"" moments. Quick shoutout to my wife for putting up with me disappearing after work doing late nights for months. She's either incredibly supportive or just happy I wasn't watching TV. 

Tested with friends and family. It's stable. Let's see how it handles 50 or 100 concurrent users. What it does:

\- Generates personalized audio stories (kid's name, family members as characters)

\- Interactive - kids pick what happens at decision points

\- 5 languages (we live bilingual - some languages are personal to us, others based on expected demand) 

\- Bedtime mode (calmer pacing) or Adventure mode

\- Ages 3-12



The ask: 2 stories are free, no credit card. If you have kids in that age range and want to try it, I'd genuinely love honest feedback. What works, what's confusing, what's missing. And if your kid actually enjoys it... that would make my month.

**Key capabilities:**

* Automatic language detection (Thai ↔ English)

# The Thai-English Translation Crisis: Why Traditional Tools Create Unnecessary Barriers in 2025

The Thai-English language pair represents Southeast Asia's most critical translation corridor, connecting over 69 million Thai speakers with the global English-speaking business ecosystem. Yet despite decades of technological advancement, translation tools continue to create unnecessary barriers that undermine communication quality and impose prohibitive costs.

**The scale of the challenge:**

>

>

>

This massive bilingual population creates enormous demand for accurate, efficient Thai-English translation—yet most tools fail to deliver the contextual intelligence required for professional communication.

# The AI Translation Market Explosion

The market for AI-powered translation tools is experiencing explosive growth, reflecting the critical need for intelligent language solutions:

>

>

This growth underscores translation's critical role in global business—yet the tools to deliver it efficiently remain inaccessible to most users.

# The Thai-English Challenge: Tonal Complexity and Script Barriers

Thai and English are linguistically distant languages with fundamental structural differences that make accurate translation notoriously difficult. According to [**research on Thai corpus challenges for AI systems**](https://datalab.flitto.com/en/company/blog/thai-corpus-for-ai-systems-challenges-and-opportunities/), key challenges include:

**Tonal Language Complexity:**

>

Thai is a tonal language where pitch changes fundamentally alter meaning. The word ""mai"" can mean ""new,"" ""burn,"" ""wood,"" or ""not"" depending on tone. English speakers lack this tonal framework, while Thai speakers must navigate English's complex grammar and irregular verb systems.

**Script and Word Boundary Recognition:**

>

Thai script presents unique challenges: no spaces between words, vowels that appear above/below/around consonants, and implicit vowels that aren't written. This makes automated parsing difficult for machine translation systems that must identify word boundaries through context alone.

**Cultural and Contextual Barriers:**

According to [**research on machine translation challenges**](https://www.1stopasia.com/blog/thai-machine-translation-challenges/), Thai's tonal nature poses significant challenges for speech recognition systems. The language's reliance on context rather than inflection means translators must infer grammatical information that isn't explicitly stated—creating ambiguity that generic tools consistently fail to resolve.

# The Business Impact: Translation as Strategic Necessity

The business implications of poor translation are severe. According to [**CSA Research**](https://www.ecinnovations.com/blog/what-is-business-translation/):

>

>

For Thai-English translation specifically, the stakes are even higher. Thailand represents Southeast Asia's second-largest economy and a critical tourism destination, making effective communication with Thai markets essential for international business success—yet most tools create barriers rather than removing them.

# The Tourism and Travel Imperative

Thailand's position as a global tourism destination creates massive demand for accurate Thai-English translation:

>

The global tourism industry relies heavily on translation services to bridge language gaps, making travel possible and giving travelers confidence to explore new places. According to [**research on translation for travel and tourism**](https://www.motaword.com/blog/translation-for-travel-and-tourism-bridging-language-gaps), tourism translation is what makes global travel possible—ensuring travelers can navigate safely while making sure they understand critical information.

# How the Best AI for Thai-English Translation Solves These Problems

[**Thai-English Translation AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) eliminates translation barriers through specialized, context-aware processing designed specifically for the Thai-English language pair.

|Traditional Translation Tools|Best AI for Thai-English Translation|
|:-|:-|
|Manual language selection required|Automatic detection and direction|
|Single tone (often too formal or too casual)|Adaptive register (colloquial ↔ formal)|
|Translation only|Translation + back-translation verification|
|Explanations and commentary clutter output|Pure translation—no commentary|
|Inconsistent handling of proper nouns|Standard localized forms|

# Automatic Language Detection and Direction

The AI instantly identifies whether your input is Thai or English and translates accordingly. Type ""สวัสดี"" and receive ""Hello"" in English. Type ""Hello"" and receive ""สวัสดี"" in Thai. No buttons, no settings—just paste and translate.

Mixed-language input is handled intelligently: [the AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) detects the dominant language and translates the entire message accordingly, preserving the intent of code-switching common in bilingual communication.

# Contextual Tone Adaptation: Solving the Formality Problem

[**Thai-English Translation AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) defaults to natural, conversational tone but automatically shifts to formal register when content is clearly professional, legal, academic, or technical.

* **Casual conversation:** ""อยากกินข้าว"" → ""I want to eat"" (not ""I desire to consume rice"")
* **Business email:** ""ขอเรียนให้ทราบว่า"" → ""Please be informed that"" (not ""Just letting you know"")
* **Technical documentation:** Maintains precise terminology and formal structure

This eliminates the awkwardness of overly formal casual messages or inappropriately casual professional communications—critical in a culture where formality mismatches can damage relationships and credibility.

# Built-in Verification Through Back-Translation

Every translation includes a back-translation to the original language, allowing you to verify accuracy even without bilingual expertise—addressing the verification gap that creates risk in professional communications.

**Example output format:**

    I want to drink coffee
    
    ---
    
    ฉันอยากดื่มกาแฟ
    

If the back-translation doesn't match your original intent, you know to rephrase. This verification loop is critical for high-stakes communication like legal documents, medical information, or business contracts.

# Handling Linguistic Complexity: Tonal Intelligence

[**The AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) addresses the structural challenges unique to Thai-English translation:

* **Tonal disambiguation** – Uses context to resolve ambiguities created by Thai's five-tone system
* **Script processing** – Seamlessly handles Thai script's complex character combinations and word boundary recognition
* **Cultural context preservation** – Recognizes and translates idiomatic expressions naturally rather than literally
* **Politeness particle handling** – Automatically includes appropriate politeness markers (ครับ/ค่ะ) based on context

# Zero Commentary, Pure Translation

[**Thai-English Translation AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) operates with surgical precision: input → translation → back-translation. No explanations, no greetings, no delays.

This design is intentional. When you need translation, you need it now—not after answering questions about formality level or explaining context. The AI makes intelligent assumptions based on content and delivers results instantly.

# How to Use the Best AI for Thai-English Translation: Zero-Friction Workflow

Using [**Thai-English Translation AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) requires no setup or configuration:

**Step 1: Paste Your Text**

Copy any Thai or English text into the input field. The AI accepts everything from single words to multi-paragraph documents. No need to specify source or target language—detection is automatic.

Example: Paste ""ฉันจะไปประชุมตอนบ่าย"" (Thai business context)

**Step 2: Automatic Language Detection**

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) instantly identifies the input language and determines translation direction. Thai input triggers English output; English input triggers Thai output. Mixed-language content is translated based on the dominant language.

**Step 3: Contextual Translation**

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) analyzes content to determine appropriate register (casual vs. formal) and applies natural phrasing conventions. Business terms receive professional translations; casual conversation receives colloquial equivalents.

Output for example: ""I will attend the meeting this afternoon""

**Step 4: Back-Translation Verification**

Immediately below the translation, [**Thai-English Translation AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/thai-english-translator/) provides a back-translation to your original language, allowing you to verify accuracy without bilingual expertise.

Back-translation: ""ฉันจะเข้าร่วมการประชุมในช่วงบ่าย""

**Step 5: Use or Refine**

If the back-translation matches your intent, use the translation confidently. If not, rephrase your original input for better results. This verification loop ensures accuracy for critical communications.

I tried to end the limbo and she blocked me. Should I hold out hope or accept it’s over?,"**TL;DR:**

Woman I didn't know (but had a mutual friend with) adds me on Facebook after I liked a photo with her and my friend in - because she finds me attractive. A year later I message her via Instagram and we fall into a very intense emotional/sexual connection over messages and calls – but she has a boyfriend she’s unhappy with. She repeatedly tells me she fancies me, misses our chats, and would love to kiss me, and repeatedly refers to a future ""us"". She pushes to meet, then panics hours before and cancels. I get stuck in limbo and eventually send a long “I can’t do this anymore” message and remove her from all socials. She blocks me on Instagram. I’m heartbroken, can’t stop thinking about her, and I’m torn between sending her a long “love letter” via Facebook or accepting she’s gone for good.

Background

* In mid 2024, a girl added me on Facebook after I liked a photo she was in.
* We didn’t know each other in real life. She later admitted she added me because she thought I was attractive.
* I thought she was gorgeous too which is why I accepted, but for about a year we never spoke – just sat as Facebook friends, liking each others photos occasionally.
* At this point in time I was in an LTR too, but unhappy. I ended it a few weeks after the chatting with this girl started - t was a catalyst, not the cause.

Fast forward to September 2025:

* On her birthday, I sent her a simple “Happy Birthday” message via private message on Instagram. She replied within minutes.
* That was our first real communication.
* From there, things escalated quickly.

# The connection (messages, flirting, sexting, calls)

Over the following weeks/months:

* We started messaging every day – mornings, evenings, all the time.
* She told me, eventually that she fancied me and was physically attracted to me.
* She called me a “walking green flag” more than once.
* We had:
   * Flirty chats
   * Deep emotional conversations
   * Sexting (proper, mutual, enthusiastic)
   * Long phone calls where time flew by
* She said things like:
   * “I’ve been thinking about you” after 12 days of no contact
   * “I miss our chats too, and it’s definitely not just you that misses them”
   * “I would love a kiss xx” / “from you xx”
   * ""I would love for you to be lay cuddling me all night""

She knew I fancied her. I told her I was thinking about kissing her. She openly told me she would love that.

We also had little shared fun ""us"" things, that weren't emotional or sexual, but were the basis of a proper friendship.

This wasn’t just surface flirting. It felt like we were both falling for each other emotionally.

# The complication: she has a boyfriend

The whole time, she has had a boyfriend, of 2-3 years. She doesn't live with him, and he lives 50+ miles away, and is away with work for a lot of weekends of the year. He has a child, who causes conflict for the girl. They had previously discussed living together, but she said she couldn't, because of how he is with her, and the child. He works away a lot, and she cannot deal with not seeing him.

From her side:

* He works away a lot.
* They don’t see each other every weekend.
* She’s been unhappy with:
   * the distance,
   * the lack of quality time,
   * some dynamics with his child,
   * and especially the lack of affection (she’s very affectionate, he apparently doesn’t even like kissing her much).
   * he gets defensive when she tries to discuss any of these issues with him
   * he told her she was too demanding
* She told me she struggles with the situation, that it’s been going on for at least 9 months. Also confirmed by our mutual friend.

In the early days of chatting, we were very open and honest with each other about our relationships, and what worked and what didn't.

Her mutual friend told me:

* The girl has been unhappy in her relationship for ages - 9/12 months.
* She thought it was “certain” the girl would leave him eventually.
* She encouraged me at one point to “explore” the connection because it was obvious that we both liked each other, and there was something there.

So the girl is clearly emotionally under fed in her relationship, and I was meeting those needs - attention, validation, affection, desire. She even said so in a message to me ""you make me feel so special, wanted, and attractive"".

# The near-meet & “limbo”

At one point:

* The girl pushed to meet me, asking 3/4 times, and really wanted to see me in person.
* I wanted this as well, and at this point, I was single.
* But when it got close to actually happening, on the morning of, she panicked and cancelled, saying she was sorry but she needed a little more time before we met, and that she 'was having a freak out'.  We were only meeting for a Sunday late-morning coffee.
* Afterwards she said she still “really, *really* wanted to meet” but I think it crossed a boundary for her.
* She said she was confused, and had never been in this situation before. 
* She said that she really needed to work out what she wanted, and which path to go down. That was weeks before the limbo properly kicked in, and she just didn't make a decision, instead kept trying to flirt and chat.

This is where the limbo really kicked in:

* She kept the emotional/sexual connection going, and wanted us to continue flirting with each other as we'd ""not defined what 'this' was""
* She’d say she fancied me, missed me, wanted to kiss me.
* But she stayed with her boyfriend.
* Whenever things got intense or real (like meeting, or talking about what we were to each other), she’d pull back, go quieter, or disappear for a day.

I tried to set boundaries:

* Told her I didn’t want to be kept in limbo, but that I wasn't pressuring her.
* Said the door was open if she was ever single, but I couldn’t do the half-in/half-out forever.
* Tried giving her space more than once.

Every time I pulled back, she seemed to come back:

* After 12 days of silence: “I’ve been thinking about you”.
* She liked my Facebook picture quickly.
* She engaged in a playful Facebook poking.
* She’d restart flirty conversations.

So I kept getting sucked back into it.

# The recent flare-up 

Most recent sequence (early December):

* There had been another period of silence.
* Then, last weekend, I posted a story on Instagram.
* She reacted to a photo of me with a 😍 emoji.
* That really cracked everything open again.

What followed was this:

* I liked some of her dog photos, on her dog's instagram account that she had.
* We had some light flirty chat.
* She said “We had good chats didn’t we xx” and “I miss our chats too, and it’s definitely not just you.”
* She also said “I would love a kiss xx” and clarified “from you xx” - this was just days before everything blew up.

For me, that was massive. I already liked her a lot, and it felt like we were basically both admitting the attraction was still very much alive. But she still had a boyfriend. And she was due to see him again this week after his 3 weeks of being away.

# My “I’m done” message

After all that, I hit the wall emotionally.

I felt like I was

* back in limbo
* hooked on the dopamine hits from her messages/reactions
* unable to move on or connect properly with other women (I’ve been on a couple of dates with someone else but the energy isn’t the same)

So I sent her a long message (paraphrasing):

* “I’m not doing this anymore.”
* “I’d already said I wasn’t being kept in limbo, and your reaction to my story started it all again.”
* “I really like you, and it’s clear you like me too - with the 😍 and saying you’d love a kiss from me.”
* “But you’re in a relationship, and keeping me in this in-between is stopping me from finding happiness with someone who chooses me, for me.”
* “I don’t like the lack of clarity, or communication dropping off when things get difficult.”
* “Whatever ‘this’ is now, it’s over for me. I’m done.”

I then:

* removed her from my instagram (unfollowed, removed as follower etc)
* unfriended her on Facebook (which is where it all started)
* blocked her on Instagram (and her dog account) 

Afterwards I panicked, felt awful, and unblocked her, but didn't request to follow again.

A few hours later, she blocked me on Instagram.

So currently:

* I’m blocked by her on Instagram.
* We are not friends on Facebook, but she hasn’t blocked me there. Which I think is a conscious decision.
* I’m not blocked on TikTok either, but I'd already unfollowed.

# What our mutual friend said

I told her what I’d done and how I felt. She said:

* The girl won’t make a decision if I’m still there as an option.
* It’s very obvious that we have a connection.
* It’s obvious she is bored and looking elsewhere emotionally because her needs aren't being met.
* If I let her have her cake and eat it, she won’t choose.
* I did the right thing by calling it and stepping back.
* She isn’t ready to leave her boyfriend yet because she can’t even be honest with you about how she feels.
* “If she’s keen, she’ll find you.”
* She also said the girl will probably be feeling the same as me right now and that she wouldn’t be surprised if the girl unblocks me by the weekend.

# Where I’m at mentally/emotionally

I feel:

* Completely heartbroken, like I’ve just broken up with someone I was properly with.
* I miss her like hell – her messages, her voice, her sense of humour, the way she made me feel and the way I made *her* feel.
* I can’t stop thinking about her.
* Part of me is angry (I was in limbo, she kept me half-in/half-out).
* Part of me is defensive (I know I had every right to set a boundary).
* Part of me is full of guilt (I hate that I’ve hurt her and blown this up).
* Part of me still massively wants to be with her in the future if she was single and emotionally available.
* Part of me wants to undo that last message to her.

I know logically that I did the only thing that could truly break the cycle.

But emotionally it feels 10x worse right now than when I was in limbo, because now it feels like I’ve lost her (even as a friend) completely.

# The “love letter” I’m tempted to send

Since then, I’ve written a long “love letter” to her (I haven’t sent it).

In that letter I basically say:

* How much she meant to me.
* How I fell for her without meaning to.
* All the little things I loved about her.
* How much I wanted to get to know the 'real' her.
* That what we had felt real to me, even though we never met.
* That I’m heartbroken it ended like this.
* That I didn’t want it to be goodbye.
* That I still believe the connection was rare and special (this is also something that she said, that 'it must mean something if we've ended up chatting the way we do' - and that was AFTER the cancelled meet up.

I’m tempted to send this via Facebook message, since that’s still open and we’re not blocked there. I know it’s a bit of a “back door” after she blocked me on IG, and I’m aware that might not be respecting the boundary she’s trying to create to cope.

My motives for sending it:

* I want her to truly understand how deeply I cared (and still care).
* I want her to know she didn’t imagine it - that I really did fall for her.
* I think a part of me wants to give her one last chance to say “this isn’t over, I want to explore this properly” if she ever reaches that point.
* Another part also just wants peace and to know I’ve said everything I needed to say.

I’m fully aware it could look desperate or like I’m not honouring the block.

# What I’m asking you guys

I’m stuck between:

1. **S**ending the love letter via Facebook, knowing:
   * She might never read it.
   * She might read it and feel overwhelmed/pressured.
   * It might make her feel worse or push her further away.
   * Or it might be the thing that, in time, makes her understand what this was to me.
2. Doing nothing, leaving it where it is:
   * Letting the IG block stand.
   * Not messaging her anywhere else.
   * Letting her come to me if she ever wants to, when she’s single / clearer / ready.
   * Sitting with this awful uncertainty and heartbreak in the meantime.
3. Burning all bridges completely, e.g. blocking her on Facebook too:
   * So there’s no way back, and I force myself to move on.
   * But that also potentially closes off any future reconnection, which a big part of me is screaming out loudly for.

Given everything above - her behaviour, the mutual friend’s insights, and how this actually played out:

* Should I send the love letter via Facebook, as one honest, final communication?
* Or should I respect the Instagram block as her way of coping and stay completely silent now?
* Is blocking her on Facebook as well a healthy boundary, or just self-punishment/panic?
* For people who’ve been on either side of this (the person in the relationship, or the “other” emotional person), what actually helped in the long run?

I know I can’t have her as things stand.

I’m just trying to work out whether there’s any value - for her or me - in sending that final message, or whether the kindest thing for everyone is to leave it exactly where it is and try to heal. Or whether there's something else that I could do, that I haven't considered.

There are probably plenty more nuances to this that I haven't covered, but it's so difficult to capture everything. I will be honest, I did use AI to help me construct this, as I couldn't get it all down on 'paper' in a coherent way.

ملاحظة: انا لِبسي علطول كان يبقى محترم جدا وكنت لابسة حجاب كويس بالرغم ان انا مش محجبة ولما سألت اهل ماما، كل البنات قالوا ان ده شئ عادي وبيحصل كثير بالأخص لو البنت عمرها مش كبير (20s-30s)

انا اسفة لو كان كلامي مش حلو بس انا مدمرة نفسيا من كل اللي حصل واللي شفته كمان واكيد مش اقصد ان كل الناس سيئة بس اغلب اللي اتعاملت معاهم كانوا كائن غير البشر بجد.

Will try to keep up to date for those who may be scared,"Started metformin ER 500mg last night. My insulin was 20! Yikessss. My CGM has been saying beforehand that my glucose is an average of 110 (give or take 10 points because that’s about how off it is from my finger prick) 


So I didn’t sleep well. My body was very relaxed but I was so scared I’d have stomach issues so my anxiety kept me up and kept waking me up. I can’t blame metformin for that. That was just me reading horror stories about it. 


My stomach is fine! A little gassy but I also started a probiotic yesterday to pair with it. So it’s hard to tell what made me gassy. 


My glucose last night dropped to 85! I haven’t seen that number in a hot minute. I am a little woozy/lightheaded but I think it’s from the sugar fluctuations. And I do feel a bit weak. But my body is just probably like “bitch wtf is 85. This isn’t 100. Panicccc” at the time of writing this it has since crept back up to like 98. 


What’s wild is my brain can think a little more quietly. Like it’s not racing at 100mph. Also I had to add a protein shake to my coffee because the thought of food right now is just giving me the ick. So yeah, it’s def doing something.

1pjxj9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjxj9p,Upcyling an old yellowed oak bench into an epoxy inlaid coffee table,"A few months ago I bought what I thought was an oak coffee table… which turned out to be a bench. But I still wanted to use it as a coffee table! So I decide it to make it one. The problem was my wife didn’t like the yellowish finish, and the groove in the top collected crumbs and all kinds of dirt. That’s when I thought: why not fill it with blue epoxy? And down the epoxy rabbit hole I went: I watched lots of videos on choosing the right epoxy, dyeing it, pouring, polishing… the whole thing.

So, this is what I did: I sanded the lot to remove the yellowish colour. I then built a template to route a wider groove for the epoxy. I got lucky and didn’t mess this one (like I did with my previous cutting board). I then dyed some epoxy and poured it.  That’s when I learned two things: your piece needs to be level in every direction, and epoxy will find any gap to leak through.

I ended up with some spots where the epoxy was proud by a mil and others where it was a couple mil under. I tried hand-planing for an hour before giving up and running it through my mentor’s thicknesser. Another lesson: avoid planing, sanding, or thicknessing epoxy if you can: once you lose that pristine surface, getting it crystal clear again means sanding through every grit up to 10,000. After consulting Reddit (and accepting reality), I just sanded everything to 240 and called it a day.

With the epoxy and wood finally level, I carefully applied stain to match the walnut colour of my TV stand (posted separately). I didn’t want to tape over the epoxy and deal with sticky residue, so I used a small brush and worked slowly around it. I finished it with two coats of Osmo Polyx transparent and voila: Wife is happy. I’m happy.

My husband’s brother divorced about 15 years ago. We did not ‘take sides’ because we could see how both BIL & SIL were issues. BIL is an alcoholic and SIL has a spending addiction. A lot has happened in the last 15 years but this past year has been the cherry on top. Also—their marriage resulted in my 2 amazing nieces who are now in their early 20s. 
BILs alcoholism has increasingly gotten worse resulting in him getting fired from a great career job, unable to keep jobs, getting a DUI and losing his car, getting evicted from his apartment and forcing him to move in with my In-laws 6 years ago. He has never been close to being able to move out. 
SILs spending resulted in her filing bankruptcy 7 or 8 years ago, but no habits have changed. 
Nieces are both in college (free because FAFSA) and they both work part time jobs. 
Nieces are close with my daughters who are similar ages so I hear 90% of this stuff from my daughters. 
After 2 years of my enabling in laws empty threats to kick BIL out of their basement, it came to a head this August. My nieces asked for my husband and my help to talk to their dad and tell him they were done with him and cutting him out of their life if he didn’t figure out a way in the next 30 days to get into a treatment program. The conversation was HARD but my nieces are amazing and strong. 
BIL entered treatment in September. And he’s still there! 
Nowwwwww, my girls have started telling me my nieces are having big issues with their mom. She has had trouble keeping jobs the past 7 or 8 years. Combo of layoffs, and her being a terrible co-worker. Last job fired her for creating a hostile workplace. So she took a huge pay cut job with an hour long commute just to have some income because she didn’t qualify for unemployment benefits. 
When the last firing happened in the spring, a bad storm blew through town and her house had fallen tree damage to the roof and deck. Insurance gave her 13k to get it fixed. She spent that on ‘bills’ because she didn’t have a job. So house has tarp over part of the roof and she has broken/dangling tree branches that hang over neighbors fences. Neighbor complains every storm that she needs to get them removed before it destroys their fence. 
The house has been a money pit and I’d suspect there is zero equity built up, and possibly she owes more than the house is worth. 
So, my girls keep seeing Venmo transactions FROM the nieces TO their mom. My girls start asking and apparently ex sIL made the girls max out student loans (even though with their FAFSA they get a lot of student aid) and then guilt trip them into giving her money. ‘Your dad hasn’t helped for years!’ ‘I NEED gas money or I’ll lose my job and be even worse off!’ So last night I asked my girls to find out how much they’ve loaned. 
One niece has given 15k, the other niece has given 19k. Plus my nieces claim she has 20k maxed out credit card. 
Soooo, if you include the 13k insurance $$ because the house still needs fixed, she’s in the hole for about $77k not including Mortgage and works a 48k job with hour long commute. 
The nieces will never see that money again and they are on the hook for paying off the student loans!!!! 
I’m furious with ex-SIL!!! I want to call her up and tell her to stopppp. When everything was going on with BIL going to rehab- SIL called me to talk and her biggest concern was ‘so he’s just going to be in treatment for 4 months and not working so I’m going to have to pay for everything???’ Which I pointed out ‘yes! Exactly! Because if he doesn’t get treatment he probably will die in the next year and then you will for sure be paying for everything forever.’ I didn’t realize in that conversation the extent of her financial issues! But what???? Your daughters are supporting themselves (and HER it turns out!) so she JUST needs to support herself. 
The nieces know my girls tell me everything, this feels similar to their cry for help with their dad. That started 2 years ago or so with My girls telling us stuff they’d hear from nieces about BIL, so I met my nieces for coffee and got the whole scoop and asked how we could support them. It’s been a couple years of conversations and my husband trying to get his brother help that lead to the August convo that got their dad into treatment. So I feel this is a cry for help, BUT there are less ties. She’s the ex-in law. Not my husband’s sibling. We aren’t that close with her. 
I’m trying to find time to take my nieces to coffee and see how things are going with their dad (husband’s parents will not talk about it. My enmeshed MIL has been a hysterical mess because her precious bee bee ‘has’ to miss the holidays this year.) I want to make sure they are doing ok and getting any therapy/support they need. And I want to breech the topic of their mom. 

BUT—husband thinks: 1) nieces are adults and can make $ decisions 2) it’s ex-SILs problem, stay out. 

So do I talk to nieces and let them know that I know and offer to help with a conversation with their mom, my ex SIL, where my nieces say they will no longer ‘loan’ any money? Or is this not my circus, not my monkeys??

TLDR: ex SIL has borrowed close over 30k from my barely adult nieces and I’m not sure whether to try and help my nieces or to stay out. ",14,1765459695.0,TwoHotTakes,14,1.0,False
1pjxhb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romantasy/comments/1pjxhb5/kris_coffee_money_spoiler_free_review_rejected_by/,Kris' Coffee Money Spoiler Free Review: Rejected by Jaymin Eve,"**###What is this?**

So I'm writing a romantasy novel, but I've never actually read any romantasy novels. So I went onto [Romance.io](http://Romance.io) and grabbed 21 novels with the following criteria:

Fantasy tag

More than 80k words (roughly 320 pages)

4/5 spice

less than 100 reviews

I then went through and grabbed novels at random without looking at any content tags or warnings, and did not read the blurb and did not look at the cover

Most of the time this criteria gave me a book later in a series of novels, so I would just go to the first novel instead. This gave me a wide range of spice ratings from 1 to 5 and most had more than 100 reviews

I then sorted it by average rating, and we are starting this journey with the worst rated one, which is {Rejected by Jaymin Eve}

**###What are the stats?**

Published Dec 8th, 2020

1 of 3 in a book series titled ""Shadow Beast Shifters""

3/5 Spice rating

Had 398 pages on Kindle with default font sizes

Cost me $4.32 after tax to pick up the book

Had 211 reviews at the time of reading with an average rating of 3.89

**###How did you like it?**

I give the book a 4/5 stars. I did enjoy my time with the book. It was not perfect by any stretch. The book felt like it was not really meant to be taken seriously, the author felt like they were having fun writing it, and I enjoyed it for what it is

If you wish to read this book, please prepare yourself for massive cliffhangers and just commit to reading the entire series.

There really isn't any character or story arcs resolved in this novel. It very much felt like an introduction to everything to be resolved in the next novel

I honestly don't have alot of high hopes any character arcs will be resolved in the next book either, or ever. We just don't resolve things around these parts

**###Plot**

It definitely felt this was more of a fantasy novel than a romance novel. The ""romance"" did not feel like the main focus of the book

What ""romance"" there was, I really did not care for. Maybe not the best book to start for my first book looking for romance

The plot was something else. I was not able to predict what was going to happen, and I've read ALOT of fantasy/scifi novels in my lifetime. This was done in a very good way, imo

The author was clearly having fun with it, and I was having fun with the author. Alot of things that were toxic that the characters were doing would basically blow up in their faces constantly with consequences, and I had a alot of fun reading it

**###World Building**

This is a fantasy novel, so some world building is expected

I did enjoy the setup of the world building. Alot of it is spoilers, but since this was my first romantasy book, alot of it felt very new, but it did feel like the author had some kind of expectations on the reader being able to know what all the terms used were

I didn't understand, but you might

I was thoroughly teased with a bunch of cool places that we don't get to go to, but hopefully see in the rest of the series

**###FMC**

What saved the book for me was the female main character. She was fun and energetic and snarky and never let any obstacles that came her way ever get her down. She would have confidence in herself that would result in things blowing up in her face, but she always kept fighting and it was fun seeing her interact with everyone

The FMC had alot of snark and zingers thrown out at EVERYONE. The author definitely had some words to say about toxic MMCs and I was there for the tea

If I do continue the series, it will be because of her and wanting to see how her story ends

**###MMC(s)**

There were a few MMC's? I guess? They didn't feel like they were ""main"", just kinda there and being assholes

There is one ""romance"" but it's not very satisfying and feels very hit and miss and preparing for the next novel

I did not really care for any of the Male Characters. None of them ever felt like they cared at all about the FMC and the only relations they really had with the FMC were in relation to how she made them feel

It did feel intentional though, they were written in way that you're not really rooting for them

IMO the FMC should drop all of them, but maybe things change in future books of the series

One of the Male Characters felt inconsistent and not really acting how you would expect them to, and is ultimately what dinged the story from a 5 and 4.5 star rating (along with the metric ton of story arcs refusing to be resolved)

**###Antagonist(s)**

The definition of an antagonist is a person or object or force that keeps the main character from achieving their objective or goal

With that in mind, there really isn't an antagonist since the FMC is pretty happy with her situation and it doesn't really feel like she has many goals. Well, serious ones anyways. She's content with being dragged around by the men to the next plot device while hurling insults

Like, get some goals girl

Maybe in the next books one of the MC's will win the race to being the biggest asshole and become the antagonist? Stay tuned

**###The Spice**

I'm very disappointed with 3/5 spice rating

I feel like this would be a PG-13 at best if it were a movie

I'm too upset with 3/5 spice to really be objective here

That's all I really have to say without spoilers

**###Final Thoughts**

For how much I spent on the book, I thought it was a good time and discovered some new kinks for myself

I am not sure if I'll continue the series. I want to see more of this subgenre of shifters first. I definitely thought the writing and dialogue was consistent enough to warrant the next book. It's definitely set up with massive cliffhangers so be prepared to read the next one if you do wish to check it out

**Otherwise, I thought my coffee money was well spent on the novel, and I enjoyed it**

Next book I'll post a review for is Lady of Darkness by Melissa K Roehrich",1,1765459600.0,Romantasy,1,1.0,False
1pjxh84,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMicroWins/comments/1pjxh84/good_food_and_bad_food/,Good food and bad food,"My kids are now 18 and 16. We still use these words 🤣

When they were toddlers, we simply labeled food as good food vs bad food. any drink that's not water is bad drink. Any type of processed food, fast food, all sorts of sweets, junk food = bad food. I have not heard of anyone else using these labels. But they worked for us. I hope they work for you too

*Storytime (for more context):*

When they asked us about our coffee (black), we say that when there is a lot of sugar, it's a bad drink. if it's just black, it's just colored water. 

We never banned bad food. But because toddlers understand bad vs good (the words), it was easier to restrict. If we went out for saturday lunch and they drank iced tea, it was easier for me to not let them drink orange juice on sunday. ""Child, you had a bad drink yesterday. Let's wait a few days before drinking anything bad again."" 

The kids loved hotdogs, nuggets and spam, so we'd have those maybe every couple of weeks. But I grew up lower middle class and we had to stretch every little bit of food. As a child, the only way i ate hotdogs were when they were sliced into really thin coins and cooked with eggs (not omelette, just loose stirfry type). Two hotdogs and five eggs (with garlic and onion) could feed five kids for lunch. Spam was cubed really small and mixed with shredded cabbage. Anyway, I served the same thing to my kids and they loved it.  

So they learned about moderation. My eldest loves soda, my youngest loves boba tea. Both will drink their faves maybe once a week. Same with food; they have been brainwashed to choose a stew vs fried, to avoid overly oily food; and basically make more healthful choices. 

Admittedly, it is easier for us in my country to eat healthily (based on what i've been reading about limited access to fresh healthy food in the US). Where we live now, there is a woman on a bicycle passing by our house 3x a week selling fresh fish. Two streets away from my house is a vegetable cart selling fresh produce everyday. Even our ""processed"" food at the butcher's is just pre-marinated meats. So that all we have to do is chuck em in the airfryer. (there is ultra processed food in the supermarket like TV dinners, mostly imported from other countries. cost is quite high so it's not often that we'd buy them).

1pjxgfo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pjxgfo,(Loved trope) Silly/weird moment is surprisingly metaphorical to the characters,"[1] Breaking bad- The fly


This episode involves Walter trying to capture a fly in the meth lab because he believes it could contaminate the product. Eventually, Walt becomes frantically obsessed with this fly as if it was his ‘white whale’ and starts to overwork his cancer-ridden body. After many fails and arguments between him and his partner Jesse, Jesse puts sleeping pills in Walt’s coffee so he could recover. As the pills start to kick in, Walt becomes groggy and starts to share some of his deep emotions including how guilty he feels for his actions in the series. The fly itself represents Walt’s inner guilt that he cannot get out of his head no matter how hard he tries to destroy it.




[2] Hellboy- pancakes


A goofy two-page comic about a young Hellboy trying pancakes for the first time and loving it. Fans believe the pancakes represent the simple, innocent pleasures of being human. By embracing this food and persevering through his first instinct to refuse them, he is indirectly going against his intended purpose as a demon sent to bring the apocalypse and accepting the mundane yet comforting life of a human. Some fans also see the similarity with this and the story of Adam and Eve disobeying God by eating the forbidden fruit.




[3-5] Cowboy bebop- mushroom hallucinations

Three of the main characters are unknowingly fed hallucinogenic mushrooms that give a metaphorical look into their struggles, traumas, and desires. 


Spike sees himself walking up an endless flight of stairs with a frog on one step saying it is the ‘stairway to heaven’. This represents Spike’s never ending journey to find meaning in his life and being unable to move on from his past. 


Faye hallucinates herself swimming with a school of fish and struggling to keep up with them. This represents her ‘drowning’ in her own sorrow and being unable to navigate her own emotions due to her forgotten past.


Jet witnesses his bonsai trees come to life and has a deep philosophical conversation with them. This represents how much he desires companionship after his old friends betrayed him and how he wants to just leave his chaotic job as a bounty hunter behind to have a normal life.

1pjxfsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1pjxfsd/positive_iud_insertion_story/,positive IUD insertion story,"I ( 24F) got the Kyleena IUD this morning. I was hesitant about getting one for a long time because of all I've heard online about the insertion being very very painful. It was also my first time getting on the table at the gyno and I've only started being sexually active not so long ago. For those interested, I decided to write this point, telling how it went step-by-step. It's worth it if it helps settle some nerves. 

Backstory : I was on the bc pill as a teen. I wasn't active back then. And tbh I couldn't trust myself to take the pill at the same time everyday since I tend to be forgetful. After researching bc I concluded an IUD would be most suitable for me, as it removes the user error parameter. Also, I live in a country where the IUD is fully refundable for ppl younger than 25 and it's a big part of why I decided to get it now. 

Scheduling : I went to my local Planned Parenthood two weeks ago to get plan b after having a condom problem. While there I mentioned I'm interested in getting an IUD. I got the prescription and went to pick it up at the pharmacy a few days before the appointment. I was surprised at the size of the box. It is very long because it contained the inserter with the IUD already loaded. 

Morning of: I was instructed that I'm allowed to pregame with ibuprofen, which I did. I went to the clinic via public transport and it was around 20 min away. I wasn't really nervous, but I did browse IUD TikTok. It was a bad idea and I had to decide it might be enough internet for that morning. 

The appointment: I first talked with the doc at his desk. He asked where I am in my cycle. I mentioned the plan b and he asked me to take a urine HCG test to ascertain I'm not pregnant ( which I think is pretty routine ). The test came back negative. Since I then said I've never had a gyno exam, he suggested to get a pap as well as general STD test before the insertion. I then went behind the curtain to get undressed. The doc was indeed very good at explaining. He preloaded a syringe with numbing and said it's in case my cervix isn't open enough to get the IUD in perfectly smoothly. He also prepared the ultrasound to check the placement of the IUD after. I appreciated that he never used the vocabulary of ""slight pressure"" and shit like that. He told me I should tell him if I feel any pain and was overall pretty careful. 

The speculum: In my opinion the speculum was the worst part of the procedure for me. The insertion of it felt pretty sharp, even though it wasn't a very big one and I was really trying to relax. The sensation was very short-lived and bearable though. Also once it was past the very opening it didn't bother me much anymore. What made this part more difficult was the position of my cervix. There was some trouble in finding it. The doc said my uterus is retroverted and as such more adjustment was needed. To help this he also changed the position of the seat so that it was more upright. Once we got that down, the rest of the appointment went pretty smoothly. My cervix was soft so the doc felt confident not to use the tenaculum (which is used to hold the cervix in place and is often very uncomfortable) and the numbing was also not used. 

The Pap smear: That part tbh I didn't really realise was happening. I was informed the procedure would start, and saw the instrument going in. When it came in contact with the cervix it felt like an average period cramp for me. It was very short. When the instrument was removed I assumed it was just used to touch the cervix to manipulate its position or smth. But that was the pap :)

The IUD insertion: Then the tube with the IUD (the thing that came out of that big box I had to pick up at the pharmacy was taken out of the package. I was rather apprehensive at how it will go, but the experience was nowhere near as terrible as I imagined. The insertion was done very gently and I felt something like a pretty strong period cramp. My period tends to be alright, but can get a bit fussy every once in a while. The insertion was nothing crazy and didn't even last a minute. I might compare it also to a Covid test. Like the moment they push the testing thing far up your nose and you go ""ooo fuck that"", but it lasts slightly longer and the person isn't also twirling the stuff around if that makes sense.  

The ultrasound : that part was pretty fun. The ultrasound is a lot smaller than the speculum and the doc also showed me the screen since I was curious. We could see the IUD in place and also checked my ovaries.

Afterwards : I got a little card with the informations of my IUD (like start and end time) and was told I'll get the test results next week. I then went home and I was feeling very good so I walked and got myself a chocolate bread and coffee. Now at home I'm having some cramps but it doesn't feel any worse than my period.

Also apologies for any errors is my first time posting although not my first time on reddit.

For context my mom owns a small restaurant for about 30 years and I 25F manage it for her now after she retired, we don't have that many staff so when it gets busy I usually waited tables or manage the to go orders, here is where Miguel (50s) comes in, he's been a regular for about 5 years now and he's always been a little weird but my mom at the time was busy taking care of her elderly mother so she never interacted with him and you couldn't really put your finger in what was wrong with him it was just his vibes so nobody ever told my mom anything back then I was away on college so I didn't know much about him either.

Anyway I started managing the restaurant last year and my mom moved back to her hometown with my grandma and any and all decision are made by me, I saw more and more weird behaviors from Miguel and I could finally talk to the girls who work upfront with the costumers Marie 30F, Luisa 27F and Linda 34, Linda is the one working for us the longest and the other day when Miguel came in all of them looked very uncomfortable after he left I asked about it and they have many horrible stories about him all of them just in the line of legality basically, I asked why they never talked to my mom and they said they knew how stressed and busy she was and didn't want to add another thing for her to worry about.

Fast forward last Saturday on our lunch rush I was waiting some tables when he came in and I was the one who took his order he started talking about how he started noticing me and was waiting for the opportunity to ' get to know me better' everytime I tried to do my job he asked a very personal question and it took me about 15 minutes to finally get his order, I went to my office after that and really thought about it and listed all his bad behaviors and I'll give you the list as well so you can have all the info

1. He is basically sexuality harassing every single employee including me 
2. He made other female costumers uncomfortable for staring at them 
3. He acts like he is the most important person ever and interrupt you if you're helping someone else before him
4. He buys the cheapest thing in the menu then stay for 3 hours sometimes
5. He have his phone volume at max and ignore you if you asked him to lower the volume 
6. And the most important I don't like his smug face when he thinks he got away with something

So when it was time for him to pay I went to his table and told him this is a private business and we reserved the right to refuse service to anyone and he was not longer welcome, he obvious made a scene but I already called an other costumer of ours that Is a police officer and he was already there so he asked Miguel to leave and stop bothering us. He cross in front of the restaurant but hasn't cause any more trouble after that, my mom called on Tuesday and asked about it (I don't know how she found out) she wasn't pleased with my decision because she thinks I should've talk to her first at least but I don't think she even remembers who Miguel is, I was talking to a couple of friends and they told me I was a little harsh because ours is one of the only business that sells food at a cheap price and everything else around are coffee shops and expensive restaurants.

I don't think I was that harsh and I was putting my employees safe and comfort first but maybe there was another way to handle this and I was maybe too extreme? AITAH?",2,1765459278.0,AITAH,14,0.75,False

Standard text prompts suffer from ""Concept Bleeding""—where your outfit description bleeds into the background, or the lighting gets confused. By using a parametric JSON structure, you force the model to isolate every variable.

I get in the train and before it opens I hear ""Don't Shoot!"" and I say to myself ""long as you don't do anything crazy"". doors open, we both goto computer terminal and I'm activating it but watching him. soon as the doors close, not a second sooner, he pops half a stitcher mag into me and I do my best jr. olympics rolls to try and evade shots. the cut screen drops, we're both back in Speranza.

So I message him

>You've just created 1 hell of an enemy. If i see you top side, you get Sert Sleep number zzz's. You're gonna regret trying to sneak me.

He replies;

>Were you in the train? I was shooting for player damage task  
Feats\*

and then it dawned on me, damn.. so this may be why I random get shot at like this? but it didn't matter, I was in full Raider mode and reply;

>Yes, that was me. I now have a task, shoot RetainedLeech to sleep WHENEVER and WHEREVER I see him. The dam, space port, the Speranza coffee shop... I got pillows for you now. See you 🫵 topside raider.

he didn't respond, probably figure me to be a crazy gamer who takes this too serious. but now instead of getting mad at rats, I just play into it and promise to hunt them down topside, I know I have absolutely no way of putting myself in their gaming instances, but they don't know that lol.",1,1765459131.0,arcraiderscirclejerk,0,1.0,False

1pjx8vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pjx8vi/how_to_make_a_frappe_like_ccd/,How to make a frappe like ccd,"Hello,

I am slightly new to the make your own coffee/frappe culture and have been ordering from CCD at first ( cold dark frappe ) , then Nik Bakers ( Carmel Frappe ) , Now sometimes from Blue Tokai. 

It has been an expensive journey lol. So recently I bought some basic equipment’s ( a normal setup ) to make my frappe ( I drink that everyday ) 

The ingredients I use and the process are as follows 

1 - Lots of ice ( the most basic thing )
2 - 55-60ML milk 
3 - 2 shots of espresso from fresh beans ( Blue Tokai Vienna roast ) freshly grinded everyday 
4 - 3-4 scoops of baskin Robbins vanilla ice cream 
5 - 2 table spoons of monin caramel or DaVinci caramel syrup 

Sometimes I mix some instant coffee from sleepy owl java intense. ( less than half table spoon ) for some extra punch. 

BTW the espresso shot brews are fine. Just how it should be. 

While i think it’s better than Nik bakers caramel frappe . But definitely not better than the CCD Dark frappe . Is there something I am missing ? I am not adding extra sugar as it’s being already covered by the ice cream and the syrup . Or should I try some other coffee brand ? Or is it some ingredient which I am missing here ? 

BTW can anyone tell the exact recipe CCD use to make the cold dark frappe ? And the milk they use ? 

I use DeLonghi Dedica EC890 Compact Espresso machine to make my brews. ( just a basic setup as I said ). ",1,1765458954.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

1pjx8db,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1pjx8db/benign_fasciculation_syndrome_bfs_in_adults_a/,Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS) in Adults : A Comprehensive Scientific Review,"Found that there were little to no scientific posts about BFS so here’s a comprehensive view from academic literature:

Introduction

Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS) is a neurological condition characterized by frequent involuntary muscle twitches (fasciculations) in the absence of any underlying pathology ￼. These twitches are typically visible under the skin and arise from spontaneous contractions of muscle fibers, yet occur without muscle weakness, atrophy, or other signs of motor neuron disease. This benign nature distinguishes BFS from serious conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where fasciculations are accompanied by progressive weakness and neurodegeneration ￼ ￼. Patients with BFS often experience persistent twitching over long periods, which can be distressing even though the condition itself is harmless ￼. Notably, BFS tends to affect adults in their 30s and 40s (with a male predominance), and some reports have observed an overrepresentation of healthcare professionals among those affected ￼. The following sections provide an in-depth review of current scientific and medical research on BFS, focusing on its causes, duration, physiological and psychological mechanisms, treatment options, and prognosis, with an emphasis on peer-reviewed clinical studies and reviews.

Causes and Contributing Factors

Idiopathic Nature: The exact cause of BFS remains unknown. By definition, a diagnosis of BFS is made when a person has chronic fasciculations without an identifiable medical cause ￼. In other words, BFS is essentially idiopathic, and any underlying diseases (such as neuropathies, motor neuron disease, electrolyte imbalances, etc.) must be ruled out before labeling symptoms as BFS ￼. If a clear cause for muscle twitches is found (for example, thyroid dysfunction or medication side-effects), the condition would not be classified as BFS ￼.

Common Triggers and Exacerbating Factors: While no single definitive cause has been pinned down, research and clinical observations have identified several factors that can provoke or worsen fasciculations in susceptible individuals: Stress and Anxiety: Psychological stress is one of the most frequently reported triggers for BFS. Patients often notice their twitching intensifies during periods of heightened stress or anxiety ￼ ￼. In some cases, anxiety might not just exacerbate BFS symptoms but could play a causal role; one review suggests anxiety symptoms themselves may contribute to the development of persistent fasciculations ￼. This creates the potential for a vicious cycle where twitching causes anxiety, which in turn leads to more twitching ￼. (The psychological aspects of this cycle are discussed in detail in a later section.)

•	⁠Physical Fatigue and Exercise: Fatigue of the muscles or vigorous exercise can precipitate fasciculations. Many BFS patients report that after strenuous exercise or at the end of a long day, their muscles are more prone to twitching ￼
•	⁠Lack of sleep (which contributes to fatigue) is also commonly associated with worsening fasciculations ￼.
•	⁠Stimulants (Caffeine/Nicotine) and Alcohol: Stimulant substances are known to increase muscle nerve excitability. Excess caffeine intake (e.g. coffee, energy drinks) or use of other stimulants can heighten twitching in BFS ￼
•	⁠Some patients also report transient increases infasciculations with nicotine (smoking) or after consuming alcohol ￼ ￼. These lifestyle factors do not cause BFS by themselves, but they can exacerbate the frequency or intensity of twitches in someone who already has the syndrome. •	Exercise and Injury: As noted, exercise can be a trigger; additionally, muscle trauma or injury has been occasionally reported to induce localized fasciculations (though these usually are transient and not a chronic BFS) ￼. In BFS, even regular daily activities might bring out twitches once the muscle is at rest after use. •	Recent Illness or Other Factors: Some clinicians have observed cases where BFS began after a viral infection or in conjunction with other benign medical events ￼. For example, a case report describes a patient whose fasciculations persisted even after her hyperthyroidism was treated, suggesting a possible post-illness trigger for BFS ￼. However, such associations are not consistent across patients. Similarly, thyroid dysfunction (like hyperthyroidism) can cause muscle twitching, but if thyroid issues are corrected and fasciculations continue, those twitches may be classified as BFS ￼. Overall, these factors are considered potential contributors or triggers rather than direct causes.

Importantly, BFS is not caused by neurodegeneration or structural nerve damage – it occurs without any lesions in the nervous system. In summary, the emerging picture is that BFS likely results from a combination of individual predisposition (some inherent tendency for nerve overexcitability) and external/internal triggers such as stress, fatigue, or stimulants that provoke symptoms. Anxiety and stress stand out as major contributors that not only trigger fasciculations but also can be worsened by them, embedding BFS in a complex mind-body feedback loop.

Duration and Clinical Course of BFS

Persistence of Symptoms: Clinical studies indicate that once BFS begins, it often follows a prolonged course. Rather than being a short-lived ailment, BFS tends to persist for many months or years, though the severity of twitching may fluctuate over time. A recent systematic literature review (2024) analyzed the clinical progression of BFS in available studies and found that in 98.3% of patients, fasciculations were still present on follow-up, even when observed from 8 months up to several years after the initial diagnosis ￼. This aligns with earlier prospective data. For example, a 2-year longitudinal study following 35 BFS patients reported that 93% continued to experience fasciculations at the 24-month mark ￼. In other words, only a small minority (roughly 5–7% in that study) achieved full cessation of twitching within a couple of years of onset ￼. The main symptom of BFS – muscle twitching – can last for months or even years in most individuals ￼.

Short-Term vs Long-Term Cases: Short-term cases of BFS (twitches resolving within weeks) are not commonly documented in the literature, likely because transient fasciculations of short duration often have identifiable triggers (like acute stress, caffeine, or exercise) and may not come to medical attention as “BFS”. Most patients who receive a BFS diagnosis have symptoms that persist or recur chronically. Long-term cases spanning many years are well known. In one case report, a patient had fasciculations for three decades (30 years) without progression to any serious disease ￼. Across studies included in the 2024 review, follow-up durations ranged from a few months to several years, and virtually all patients continued to have at least occasional fasciculation activity during those follow-ups ￼.

Fluctuation and Improvement: Although complete resolution is uncommon in the short-to-medium term, many patients do experience changes in symptom intensity over time. In the systematic review, about 51.7% of patients showed improvement in the frequency or severity of fasciculations over the observation period, even though twitches had not disappeared entirely ￼. Only 4.1% were noted to have worsening symptoms in that analysis ￼. Improvement might mean the fasciculations become less frequent, less widespread, or less troublesome, allowing patients to cope better. The prospective 2-year study similarly found that certain associated symptoms like subjective muscle weakness or cramps tended to partially resolve over time in some patients (even as the twitches persisted) ￼. Anxiety levels in that study did not significantly change over the 2-year period, suggesting that patients’ concern often remains until they are convinced of the benign nature of the syndrome ￼.

In summary, BFS is usually a long-running condition: most individuals will continue to have fasciculations for years, though the degree can wax and wane. True short-term BFS that completely resolves within days or weeks appears to be the exception. On a positive note, many patients experience some improvement or periods of quiescence, and critically, studies show that BFS does not progress to serious neuromuscular disease in the vast majority of cases (discussed further under Prognosis below).

Physiological Mechanisms in BFS

Nerve Hyperexcitability: The consensus in neuromuscular research is that fasciculations in BFS result from hyperexcitability of lower motor neurons or their axons. In simple terms, the motor nerve fibers that connect to muscle fibers begin to fire off spontaneous electrical impulses without the usual command from the brain or spinal cord. These aberrant discharges cause muscle fibers to contract briefly – producing the visible twitch known as a fasciculation. Notably, evidence suggests that most benign fasciculations originate at the level of the distal motor nerve or motor unit (i.e. the nerve branch close to the muscle) rather than in the brain or spinal cord ￼. In both healthy people and patients with motor neuron disease, many fasciculations have been shown to start in the peripheral nerve and then travel along the motor neuron; some impulses can even travel backward up the nerve fiber (antidromically) due to the hyperexcitability of the motor neuron’s axonal membrane ￼ ￼. This peripheral origin is consistent with BFS being a disorder of nerve excitability rather than nerve destruction.

Electrophysiological Findings: On electromyography (EMG) testing, patients with BFS demonstrate fasciculation potentials (random motor unit discharges) but no signs of acute denervation or chronic motor neuron degeneration ￼. In a study of clinicians with fasciculation anxiety (FASICS, essentially a form of BFS in medical professionals), detailed neurophysiological exams found completely normal nerve conduction studies and normal motor unit configurations, aside from the presence of fasciculations ￼. There was no evidence of muscle fiber denervation (such as fibrillations or positive sharp waves on EMG) and no motor unit potential changes that would indicate motor neuron disease ￼. These normal findings confirm that the motor neurons in BFS are functioning and intact, albeit hyperactive. The absence of abnormal EMG changes (beyond fasciculation potentials) is a key diagnostic feature distinguishing BFS from conditions like ALS, where EMG typically shows denervation and reinnervation changes.

BFS is considered part of the spectrum of Peripheral Nerve Hyperexcitability (PNH) syndromes, which also includes cramp-fasciculation syndrome and neuromyotonia (Isaacs’ syndrome) in more severe forms. However, BFS is on the milder end of this spectrum. For instance, unlike neuromyotonia, BFS patients do not have continuous muscle fiber activity or sustained contractions; and unlike cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS), cramps (painful muscle spasms) are either absent or only occasional in BFS. Some people with BFS do report muscle cramps, but if cramps are a prominent feature, the case may be classified as cramp–fasciculation syndrome – a closely related condition thought to have a similar mechanism ￼ ￼. In the FASICS study, 15% of clinicians with fasciculations actually had the cramp-fasciculation variant (fasciculations + cramps) and a small subset had findings consistent with peripheral neuropathy or ALS, illustrating how BFS is differentiated by the lack of other neurological abnormalities ￼.

Possible Pathophysiological Theories: Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why motor nerves become hyperexcitable in BFS: •	Ion Channel Dysfunction: Some researchers suspect subtle changes in ion channel function of motor neurons (sodium, potassium channels, etc.) could make nerves more prone to spontaneous firing. This is analogous to what occurs in more severe hyperexcitability syndromes (many cases of neuromyotonia are caused by antibodies against potassium channels). In BFS, routine blood tests for such antibodies are typically negative ￼, so if ion channel dysfunction exists, it may be intrinsic (non-immune) or too mild to detect on current assays. •	Enhanced Axonal Reflexes: The observation of antidromic impulses (backfiring along the nerve) suggests that a discharge in one branch of a motor nerve could trigger neighboring motor units to fire via axonal connections ￼. This “axon reflex” mechanism might amplify a single irritated nerve fiber into a wider perceptible twitch. Essentially, a spontaneous firing in one terminal axon could spread to adjacent motor units, creating the feeling of a bigger or more persistent fasciculation than a solitary fiber discharge. •	Stress Physiology: Although stress is a trigger, there may also be a physiological component to stress-induced fasciculations. Adrenaline (epinephrine) released during stress increases excitability of nerves and muscles, potentially lowering the threshold for random muscle fiber firing. This could partly explain why people under anxiety have more twitching – their nerves are biochemically primed to fire. While this is a plausible mechanism, it’s important to note it augments underlying hyperexcitability; it doesn’t create fasciculations in someone without the predisposition (many highly stressed people do not twitch, so BFS likely requires an existing susceptibility in the motor nerves). •	Motor Unit Firing Instability: Some have suggested that benign fasciculations might represent minor instabilities in the motor neurons’ firing circuits – essentially benign misfiring. Unlike ALS where motor neurons die, in BFS the neurons are alive but occasionally “misfire” on their own. Why this happens is not fully understood. Historical studies have noted fasciculations can even be found in a good portion of healthy people if looked for (up to 70% of healthy adults have infrequent fasciculations) ￼. BFS could be viewed as an extreme end of that normal phenomenon, where the frequency is greatly increased and persistent.

In summary, the physiological mechanism of BFS is a functional hyperexcitability of motor nerves leading to spontaneous muscle fiber contractions. The process is benign – meaning it does not damage the nerves or muscles. Diagnostic testing in BFS is usually normal except for capturing the fasciculation bursts themselves. This understanding guides management: treatments often aim at calming nerve excitability rather than repairing any damage (since none is present).

Psychological Factors and Comorbidities

One of the most striking aspects of BFS is how commonly it intersects with psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety. This can be viewed from two angles: psychological stress contributing to BFS (as discussed in Causes) and BFS contributing to psychological distress. Modern research suggests a bidirectional relationship between chronic fasciculations and anxiety-related disorders ￼.

Health Anxiety and Fear of ALS: Many adults with benign fasciculations become intensely worried that the twitches are a sign of ALS or another lethal neurological illness. In fact, health-related anxiety focused on developing ALS is exceedingly common in BFS patients ￼. Blackman et al. (2019) performed a systematic review and found that a significant proportion of BFS patients meet the criteria for health anxiety disorder, previously known as hypochondriasis ￼. The health anxiety in BFS almost always centers on the fear of motor neuron disease (the medical literature notes this repeatedly), likely because patients are aware of the association of fasciculations with ALS ￼. This condition of excessive worry about twitching and ALS in otherwise healthy individuals has even been given an informal name: “fasciculation anxiety syndrome”, particularly when seen in clinicians. One study of 20 physicians with muscle twitching complaints found that 70% were ultimately diagnosed with anxiety-related benign fasciculations (“Fasiculation Anxiety Syndrome in Clinicians”, or FASICS) ￼ ￼. These clinicians had normal neurological exams aside from fascics, but they harbored significant fear of having ALS. This highlights how awareness of serious diseases can amplify anxiety; paradoxically, those with medical knowledge may be more prone to catastrophic interpretation of benign symptoms.

Somatization and Stress: There is evidence that in some patients, BFS itself may be an expression of underlying psychological stress. A retrospective comparative study looked at patients who initially presented with fasciculations and were later diagnosed either with BFS or with ALS ￼. The BFS group had a significantly higher incidence of prior psychiatric symptoms, recent life stressors, and concurrent psychosomatic symptoms compared to the ALS group ￼. There was no significant difference in current mood (anxiety/depression) at presentation, but the history of stress and psychological issues was more common in the BFS patients ￼. The authors of that study proposed that benign fasciculations might be a manifestation of psychological distress via somatization ￼. In other words, for some individuals, chronic stress or anxiety may somatize – present physically – as muscle twitching. This does not mean BFS is “all in the head,” but rather that stress could be one precipitating factor in those who are physiologically susceptible. It underscores the importance of taking a psychosocial history in patients with fasciculations; those with a background of anxiety or poor stress coping might be experiencing BFS as a form of somatic anxiety symptom ￼. Conversely, if a patient has fasciculations and denies any anxiety or stress and has no psychiatric history, clinicians are advised to monitor carefully, since in rare cases fasciculations could be the first sign of ALS in an otherwise psychologically well individual ￼. Thankfully, such cases are the exception – in the vast majority of persistent fasciculation cases with normal exams (i.e. BFS), no ALS develops on follow-up ￼.

Bidirectional Relationship: Recent literature emphasizes a two-way interaction between BFS and anxiety. Chronic twitching can generate significant anxiety, especially health-focused anxiety about what the symptoms mean ￼. This anxiety can further heighten physiological arousal and vigilance, which may in turn intensify the perception of fasciculations or even increase their frequency via stress mechanisms ￼. Blackman et al. describe this as a possible bidirectional relationship – BFS symptoms and health anxiety feed each other in a loop ￼. Over time this can lead to a reinforced syndrome where even if the fasciculations themselves lessen, the patient’s preoccupation and worry keep the cycle alive. In the prospective study by Filippakis et al. (2018), most BFS patients did report feeling anxious about their symptoms, but interestingly, only 14% had clinically significant anxiety levels on a standardized scale (the Zung anxiety self-assessment) ￼. This suggests that while pathological anxiety disorder is present in a subset, many others have subclinical anxiety or simply heightened concern. It’s worth noting that in that 2-year study, the average anxiety scores did not diminish over time, implying that reassurance alone might not have fully alleviated their worries ￼. This finding supports actively managing the psychological aspect of BFS rather than adopting a purely wait-and-see approach.

Comorbid Conditions: Besides health anxiety, some patients with BFS may also have other anxiety spectrum disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder, or mood disorders like depression (sometimes secondary to the chronic stress of symptoms). The Cleveland Clinic notes that a history of anxiety or depression is common enough to be listed among factors associated with BFS ￼. However, large-scale data on the rates of specific comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in BFS are limited. What is clear is that health anxiety (illness anxiety disorder) is the most frequently observed psychological companion of BFS ￼.

In summary, psychological mechanisms play a significant role in BFS. For some, stress and anxiety may help trigger or worsen the syndrome; for many, the syndrome triggers significant anxiety and worry in its own right. Recognizing and addressing this mind-body interplay is crucial. Experts recommend that clinicians evaluating BFS remain alert to possible health anxiety or somatization. Identifying these issues is important because treating the psychological component (through therapy, education, or medication) can greatly improve a patient’s quality of life and possibly break the cycle that perpetuates symptoms ￼.

Treatment Strategies for BFS

There is no single “cure” for Benign Fasciculation Syndrome, but various treatment approaches can help manage symptoms and improve patient comfort. Given the benign nature of the condition, treatment is often conservative and personalized, focusing on symptomatic relief and addressing exacerbating factors (especially stress or anxiety). Broadly, management can be divided into non-pharmacological (lifestyle/psychological) interventions and pharmacological therapies. Multiple peer-reviewed reports and clinical guidelines emphasize a combination of reassurance, lifestyle modification, and targeted use of medications when needed.

1.	⁠Patient Education and Reassurance: A cornerstone of BFS management is simply informing the patient about the benign prognosis of the syndrome. Reassurance that no evidence of ALS or serious disease is present can itself alleviate much of the patient’s anxiety. In studies, no BFS patient followed over years developed ALS ￼ ￼, and communicating this fact can help reduce catastrophic thinking. Education includes explaining that twitching muscles are common and that BFS is essentially a harmless hyperexcitability of nerves. Many neuromuscular specialists suggest that once diagnostic tests are normal, a strategy of “watchful waiting” with periodic follow-up is appropriate, emphasizing to the patient that serious progression is not expected. This reassurance is not a one-time event; patients often need repeated confirmation, especially when twitches flare up or anxiety spikes. According to Blackman et al., clinicians should have a “low threshold to refer for psychiatric support” if health anxiety is suspected ￼, which ties into the psychological treatment strategies below.
2.	⁠Lifestyle and Non-Pharmacological Interventions: These aim to reduce triggers of fasciculations and improve the patient’s overall stress levels and coping. Key strategies include: •	Stress Reduction: Because stress is a major trigger, methods of stress management are highly recommended. This can range from practicing relaxation techniques (e.g. deep-breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music) to making time for leisure activities that reduce tension ￼. Some patients benefit from mindfulness-based stress reduction or other behavioral techniques to control stress responses. •	Sleep and Rest: Ensuring adequate sleep and avoiding excessive fatigue can help minimize twitching. Patients are advised to maintain good sleep hygiene – a regular sleep schedule and a restful environment – since lack of sleep can exacerbate muscle hyperexcitability ￼. If patients have insomnia (possibly due to anxiety about the symptoms), treating the insomnia or using relaxation before bedtime can break a cycle of fatigue-induced fasciculations. •	Diet and Stimulant Moderation: Reducing or eliminating caffeine intake often yields improvements in twitch frequency ￼. Similarly, quitting smoking and moderating alcohol consumption are advisable (nicotine and alcohol can both influence nerve activity). A balanced diet with adequate hydration is encouraged. While there is no special “BFS diet,” some clinicians check for and correct any mineral deficiencies (for example, low magnesium or calcium) since those can increase muscle twitching ￼. If blood tests show a deficiency, appropriate supplements (e.g. magnesium supplements) may be given, although routine supplementation without a demonstrated deficiency is not proven to help BFS. •	Exercise in Moderation: Regular mild exercise might be beneficial for overall neuromuscular health and stress reduction, but overexertion can provoke twitches. Patients are usually advised to stay active but avoid very strenuous exercise or muscle overuse until twitching is better controlled. Stretching and moderate aerobic exercise can be helpful, whereas heavy weight-lifting or extreme endurance exercise might transiently increase fasciculations in BFS-prone individuals ￼. Each patient may need to find their tolerance level. •	Avoiding Additional Triggers: Any identified trigger should be managed. For example, if certain medications (like long-term anticholinergics or stimulants) are suspected to be contributing, doctors might adjust those medications ￼. Likewise, managing any coexistent conditions (e.g. ensuring thyroid levels are normal in someone with thyroid disease, or treating chronic pain that might be stressing the patient) can indirectly improve BFS.
3.	⁠Psychological Therapies: Given the strong psychological interplay, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and similar interventions have a significant role, especially for those with health anxiety. In the cases reported by Blackman et al., patients with BFS and severe health anxiety achieved relief from both anxiety and fasciculation-related distress through CBT combined with antidepressant medication ￼ ￼. CBT can help patients challenge catastrophic thoughts (“These twitches mean I have ALS”) and reduce compulsive behaviors like constant self-checking of strength. It also provides coping strategies to manage symptoms when they occur, thereby breaking the anxiety-twitch amplification cycle. Other forms of therapy, such as anxiety management training, biofeedback, or supportive counseling, may also be employed based on patient preference. The main goal is to reduce the disproportionate fear and help the patient regain quality of life despite the lingering twitches. For many, just a few months of therapy can markedly reduce their health anxiety and thus make the fasciculations much more tolerable.
4.	⁠Pharmacological Treatments: No medications are FDA-approved specifically for BFS, but several classes of drugs have been used off-label to alleviate symptoms: •	Membrane Stabilizing Agents (Anticonvulsants): Since fasciculations are due to overactive nerves, medications that stabilize nerve firing are a logical choice. Antiepileptic drugs – notably those that decrease neuronal excitability – have been tried. Carbamazepine and phenytoin were historically used to treat diffuse fasciculations, though reports suggest they often provide only partial relief ￼. More recently, gabapentin (an anticonvulsant that modulates calcium channels and dampens nerve firing) has shown promise. A 2007 case report documented a woman with a 30-year history of benign fasciculations who experienced substantial control of her symptoms after starting gabapentin ￼. The authors reviewed prior literature and noted that treatment of fasciculations is largely symptomatic, with gabapentin and similar drugs being reasonable options when symptoms are bothersome ￼. In clinical practice, gabapentin or its analog pregabalin is often used as a first-line medication for frequent fasciculations; these agents can reduce the frequency/intensity of muscle twitches in some patients by calming nerve activity ￼. Doses are typically started low (e.g. 300 mg at night for gabapentin) and titrated upward depending on response and tolerability ￼. If one agent is not effective, others like phenytoin, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine can be tried, although side effect profiles sometimes limit their use. It’s worth noting that in cases where cramps are a big component (cramp-fasciculation syndrome), medications like quinine or mexiletine (which help muscle cramps) have also been used, but for pure BFS their role is limited. •	Benzodiazepines: Low-dose benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) may be prescribed at night to both reduce twitching and ease associated anxiety. Benzodiazepines enhance GABAergic inhibition in the nervous system, which can quieten muscle twitching. While they can be effective for symptom relief, they are generally a short-term or as-needed solution given risks of sedation, tolerance, and dependency. These might be considered in a patient who has very troublesome fasciculations interrupting sleep, for example. •	Beta-Blockers: Though more commonly used for tremors or heart palpitations from anxiety, beta-blockers (like propranolol) have occasionally been tried in BFS to reduce the effect of adrenaline on the muscle twitches. The evidence for their effectiveness in BFS is mostly anecdotal. They may help indirectly by controlling physical symptoms of anxiety, which in turn could reduce stress-related twitch exacerbations. •	Antidepressants: When health anxiety or generalized anxiety is prominent, SSRIs or SNRIs (antidepressant medications) can be beneficial. These medications (for example, sertraline, escitalopram, or venlafaxine) can reduce the underlying anxiety over weeks to months, thereby possibly reducing the subjective intensity of BFS. In Blackman et al.’s report, patients received antidepressant therapy alongside CBT and saw improvement ￼ ￼. Additionally, some tricyclic antidepressants (like amitriptyline) have muscle relaxant and nerve-calming properties and could theoretically help with fasciculations, although specific data in BFS is lacking. The decision to use antidepressants is usually driven by the psychological need (treating comorbid anxiety/depression), with any reduction in twitching being a bonus. •	Others: Some small reports have looked at IV immunoglobulin or immunosuppressants in patients with more severe peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (like neuromyotonia or cramp-fasciculation syndrome, especially if autoantibodies are present). In true BFS (no autoimmune cause identifiable), such treatments are not indicated – studies find no evidence of autoimmune etiology in typical BFS cases (e.g., all patients in one series were seronegative for voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies) ￼. Therefore, immunotherapy is not part of standard BFS treatment. Muscle relaxants (such as low-dose baclofen) have been tried in some cases to reduce muscle cramping or stiffness associated with twitching, but their benefit for the fasciculations themselves is unclear. If muscle pain is present (from frequent cramps or from anxiety-related muscle tension), NSAIDs or analgesics can be used symptomatically, though they do not affect the fasciculation mechanism.
5.	⁠Effectiveness of Treatments: The effectiveness of treatment in BFS varies widely from person to person, and robust clinical trial data are limited (BFS is relatively rare and often under-studied). Generally, non-pharmacological measures and reassurance are effective first steps – many patients improve simply with stress reduction and knowing that the condition is benign. When medication is needed, gabapentin has shown good results in some case reports and is often cited anecdotally by neuromuscular clinicians as helpful ￼. Antidepressants can significantly help those with anxiety, indirectly improving quality of life and reducing the focus on fasciculations ￼. A combination approach often works best: for example, using an anticonvulsant to dampen the twitches and therapy/SSRIs to ease anxiety yields better overall outcomes in severe cases than either alone ￼. Importantly, treatment success in BFS is often measured by improvement in symptoms and patient reassurance rather than complete disappearance of fasciculations. Since a large portion of patients will continue to have some twitching, the goal is to reach a point where the twitches are minimal or no longer bothersome. Clinically, many patients do reach an acceptable steady state where they might still notice an occasional fasciculation, but it no longer causes them distress or impairment.

In summary, management of BFS is symptomatic and supportive. It ranges from simple lifestyle adjustments and reassurance for mild cases, up to combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for more severe or distressing cases. Each patient’s treatment is tailored to their symptom severity and psychological profile, keeping in mind that the condition is benign and interventions are aimed at improving comfort and mental well-being rather than curing a disease.

Resolution and Prognosis

One of the most frequent questions from patients with BFS is: “Will these fasciculations ever go away completely?” Research indicates that complete resolution of BFS symptoms occurs in a minority of cases, and usually only after a long duration, but the overall prognosis remains excellent in terms of health and functionality.

Spontaneous Resolution Rates: As discussed in the Duration section, long-term follow-ups show that total cessation of fasciculations is uncommon in the short term. In the 2-year prospective study, only about 7% of patients had full resolution of twitching by the end of the study period ￼. The remainder still had some degree of fasciculation activity. The 2024 systematic review further reinforces this: across the pooled 180 patients from multiple studies, almost all patients (98%) continued to have fasciculations on follow-up, even though over half reported improvement ￼ ￼. It appears that if BFS is going to resolve, it most likely does so very gradually. There are anecdotal reports of individuals whose BFS faded after many years, but systematic data on resolution beyond a few years are scarce (because once patients are reassured and symptoms abate, many do not continue following up with doctors). Short-term resolution (within weeks or a few months) is distinctly rare for true BFS – if fasciculations vanish quickly, it suggests the cause may have been an acute trigger that resolved (and such a case might not be labeled BFS at all).

Long-Term Outlook: Although the twitches often persist, the critical reassurance is that BFS remains benign. Multiple studies have confirmed that patients with isolated benign fasciculations do not go on to develop ALS or other motor neuron diseases in virtually all cases ￼ ￼. In the collective data, no cases of BFS later turning into ALS were seen, except for a few isolated case reports in the literature over decades (which are extremely rare and sometimes debated) ￼. Thus, the chance of BFS progressing to something life-threatening is exceedingly low, offering a very favorable prognosis in that regard. Patients can be reassured that their life expectancy is not affected and serious complications are not expected from BFS itself.

Functionality and Quality of Life: BFS may be annoying but typically does not cause functional impairment. There is no muscle weakness or atrophy in BFS, so physical capabilities remain normal. Patients continue to work, exercise, and perform activities of daily living. The main impediment to quality of life in BFS tends to be the psychological stress or distraction caused by the twitching and the associated anxiety. With appropriate management of anxiety and symptoms, most patients adapt to the condition. Over time, many report that they cope better or that the fasciculations become an “afterthought” rather than a constant worry. In the long run, especially if symptoms improve, a person with BFS can feel essentially back to normal, aside from the occasional twitch that might still occur. The resolution, therefore, might be partial (symptoms get milder) rather than absolute disappearance.

Follow-Up Recommendations: Neurologists often follow patients with a new diagnosis of BFS for a period (say 6–12 months) just to ensure no other signs develop. Once it’s clear that the syndrome is stable and benign, some patients are discharged from regular neurology care with instructions to return if any new symptoms (like true weakness) arise. Given the data, if a patient has had isolated fasciculations for a year or more with no change except perhaps improvement, the likelihood of a sinister disease is virtually nil. That said, if fasciculations significantly worsen or new neurological signs appear, re-evaluation is warranted (to rule out other disorders).

Resolution in a Small Subset: For the subset of individuals who do experience full resolution, it often happens gradually. They may notice twitches becoming infrequent and eventually disappearing. This could coincide with removal of a precipitating factor (e.g. their high-stress job ended, or they stopped excessive caffeine) or it could simply be the natural course for that individual’s nervous system to settle down. There isn’t a clear timeline for those lucky few – in absence of rigorous data, clinicians might say it could take several years. Importantly, even when fasciculations do resolve, patients are advised to maintain healthy habits because the underlying predisposition might remain; significant stress or stimulant use in the future could potentially provoke a recurrence.

In conclusion, the prognosis for BFS is generally very good. Patients almost never develop serious neurological disease from it, and with time many see improvements in their symptoms or at least in their ability to live with the symptoms. While complete resolution of twitching is not guaranteed and tends to be a long-term possibility rather than a short-term expectation, the absence of progressive weakness or physical disability means BFS is compatible with a normal, healthy life. Clinicians and patients alike should focus on managing the symptoms and anxiety to ensure the condition remains a minor inconvenience rather than a source of ongoing distress. As one review succinctly concluded: “Despite its benign nature, BFS does not appear to resolve over time, as fasciculations persist in the vast majority of cases, albeit with some improvements in more than half of patients” ￼. Therefore, the aim is to harness those improvements and mitigate any negative impacts, allowing individuals with BFS to confidently move on with their lives.

Whenever a conversation starts dying, my brain refuses to ask the classic ""so what do you do"". Instead I have a rotation of weird little questions that pop out before I can stop them. My current favorite is: ""If your life had background music like in a movie, what song would be playing this week"". It sounds kind of stupid on paper, but in real life it works way better than it has any right to. My coworkers will be half asleep at 9am, I drop that question and suddenly one person is arguing that their week is pure circus music and someone else is like ""nope, mine is just elevator jazz on a loop"". I used it on my dentist once because the silence was getting awkard and he spent the next 5 minutes explaining why his soundtrack is just white noise because he has three kids under five. I walked out with cleaner teeth and a whole new respect for that man.  



The other one that sneaks out a lot is ""what is your most useless skill that you are still weirdly proud of"". I love watching peoples faces change when they go from ""ugh small talk"" to ""wait, I can actually brag about my ability to recognize any cereal from the sound of the box shaking"". One guy at a bus stop told me he can guess pretty accurately what a person ordered just from how long they stand at the coffee pickup counter. My own answers change all the time, but the true one is probably that I can remember random wifi passwords from apartments I moved out of 6 years ago, yet I forget why I walked into the kitchen. I know these questions are kind of dorky, but they feel more honest than the default script and they let people choose how serious or silly they want to be. I also like that they dont corner anyone into talking about work, money, relationships or other stuff they might be tired of explaining. So now I am curious in a calm, nosy way. Do you have a go to question or tiny conversation game you use when you want to keep chatting with someone a bit longer, but dont want to sound like a networking robot. Or is this just my brain trying to turn real life into a talk show all the time.

Maybe some very minor dizziness, but I'm prone to that anyways so if I wasn't looking for it as a side effect I wouldn't have noticed it.

I think I have been anhedonic for years and years, and always just put one foot in front of the other. It didn't stop me from doing life, I just didn't enjoy any of it. Then seasonal depression came in extra hard and I actually started feeling bad. Really hopeless, like everything was pointless. I couldn't do stuff any more.

So I started Wellbutrin in october, and it has alleviated those extreme depression feelings, but I once again just kinda feel nothing. Or nothing positive, at least (I've started crying when reading sad stories, which I never did before, but I don't actually like that). I don't feel excited or motivated in any way. I don't feel more optimistic or hopeful. I just feel like a robot going through the motions. 

The only time this changes is if I have too much caffeine (I try to avoid having any, but sometimes coffee is too tempting) and then it feels like *Fast Depression*. It's like all the bad hopeless thoughts I had while depressed rush at me all at once and it feels like they're all going to happen imminently and there's nothing I can do about it and it's an overwhelming feeling of fear. 

I just thought I'd feel a bit better by now. Like maybe able to look forward to things, or feel excited about doing stuff again. Maybe there isn't a cure for that though.

Honest Guide From Brasov 🧛‍♂️🏰","https://preview.redd.it/s4m1zbjtok6g1.jpg?width=1620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2465888637305d2896cf7c8f2eecdee6428f1e70

I finally visited Bran Castle in Transylvania last year and it ended up being my favourite castle in Romania, hands down. It looks exactly like the dramatic hilltop castle you picture in your head, but inside it’s more creaky floors, royal bedrooms and narrow staircases than horror maze. Thought I’d share a proper breakdown for anyone trying to plan it from Brasov (or Bucharest).

Here’s the quick version:

**What Bran Castle is actually like**

* 14th-century fortress turned royal home, with furniture, photos and exhibits.
* Some Dracula / Vlad info, but the vibe is more museum + atmosphere than full-on scare attraction.
* The inner courtyard and balconies are gorgeous for photos, especially later in the day.

**Tickets & prices (rough guide)**

* Standard adult ticket is around 70 RON (\~£12 / €14 / $16).
* Cheaper for kids, students and seniors; extras for things like the Time Tunnel and Torture Chamber.
* You can buy on the day, but in summer / Halloween it really helps to pre-book or join a small group tour.

**Opening hours & timing**

* Typical pattern: Monday from around lunchtime, Tuesday–Sunday from the morning.
* Peak time is late morning to mid-afternoon when tour buses roll in.
* Best bet is to arrive for opening or visit later in the afternoon and let the crowds thin.

**Getting there from Brasov**

* Local bus from Autogara 2: cheap, 45–60 mins, perfectly manageable if you’re used to public transport.
* Day tours from Brasov and Bucharest if you want zero faff and commentary built in.
* Car hire if you’re doing a bigger Romania loop and want to add Rasnov, Piatra Craiului, etc.

**Inside the castle**

* One-way route up through tight staircases, small rooms and storyboards.
* Not great for big backpacks or serious mobility issues; lots of steps and uneven floors.
* Views over Bran village and the hills are lovely and make the effort worth it.

**Crowds & sanity tips**

* It *does* get very busy, especially July/August and Halloween season.
* Arrive early, avoid Saturday late morning, and be patient on the narrow stairs.
* If the queue looks wild, grab a coffee and give it 30–40 mins for a tour group to clear.

**Good for:**

* Castle and history fans
* Dracula-curious travellers who don’t actually want to be terrified
* Families with patient kids who can handle stairs and a bit of waiting

If you want all the details (updated prices, more on buses, tours, accessibility, plus how to combine Bran with Brasov and Rasnov), I’ve put everything into a full guide here:

1pjwsoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1pjwsoh/introducing_auto3t_auto_track_tape_torrent/,Introducing Auto3T. Auto: Track. Tape. Torrent,"## Core Functionality

Automatically (mostly) track your favorite TV Shows, Movies, Movie Collections and People across channels, all packed up into one application.

Based off of metadata provided by [tvmaze.com](https://www.tvmaze.com/) for TV Shows  
and [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for Movies and Collections.

Integrating with Jellyfin (unfortunately below 10.11.x only for now, due to a bug in the [tvmaze plugin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-tvmaze/issues/57)) as the media server, Prowlarr for Indexer Manager and Transmission as a Download Client.

## Reasoning

I never got the Arr suite to work as I wanted. That's probably due to user error, but whatever I tried, it never picked the releases that I would pick myself manually. So instead of trying to make it work as I wanted, I came to the only reasonable conclusion, start from scratch, how hard can it be? So that was back in March 2024.

So this time around, I wanted to get the state of the project to a not necessarily _complete_ state, but to a place where most things are reasonably figured out, at least for what I intend it to do. So this is where I think it is a good time to make the repo public.

## Current Features

- Extensive and free form category and keyword filtering to allow picking releases as close to what you want
- Bitrate targeting for dynamic target filesize based on duration.
- With defaults systemwide and inherited or manually overwrite
- Release tracking and timing so you can define when you want to start searching

- TV show tracking: Track a show, ingest seasons and episodes as they become available and start searching based on your configurations.
- Movie tracking: Track a movie and its release dates and start searching based on your target release, including manual configured delay to wait a bit after release.
- Collection tracking (aka boxset): Track movies in a collection automatically, even future movies getting added to the collection.
- Person tracking: Automatically (or manually) track shows and movies of a given artist / actor / director.

## Technical

- Python backend API built with trusted Django
- Sqlite for easy persistence
- Frontend built with React TS
- Packaged into a convenient Docker container running under your user of choice
- Redis for queue processing and caching

## Free as in Freedom

This is opensource (GPL3), so you can do whatever the license allows. After testing it out for a few weeks, I'm asking for your support, either by contributing to the project with code or financially as a sponsor. Also creating Github issues will be limited to supporters only. 

If you go the sponsoring route, I'm asking for the equivalent of three coffees per year from your nearest coffee shop, as we all know, all good things start with coffee. 

I'm committed to maintaining Auto3T going forward, but I also need to accept my limitations in time available in a given day. Also, emotional battery draining for open source maintainers is a real thing. So limiting that to supporters is the only way I see where I can still share the project. I hope you understand.

Been living in my car, showering at the gym, and I’ve had 2 jobs for most of it so it was easy to lie.

Lost my second job a month ago, because the shop closed down.

My full time job is waitressing, over a year ago this guy (41m) started coming in like 3 times a week after he was done work for a beer, we became pretty good friends. We bonded over both being history nerds and we’ve hung out, went to a few movies but not close close

I’ve told him a few times how I hate driving in the snow, and it scared me a lot, I also have the tiniest crappy car ever that gets stuck so easily.

 I also lied to him and said I had my own apartment this whole time.

Last night we got hit with a terrible snowstorm, and he walked in around 7. I asked what the heck he was doing and he came because I told him I’m afraid of driving in snow so he was wanting to drive me home.

In insisted I would dig out my car any find a way home, and I was panicking because I obviously didn’t have anywhere for him to drop me off. 

So I had to actually say it outloud I live in a car, I’m so embarrassed I want to die or throw up. 

I stayed in his spare bedroom last night and I’m currently awake, I didn’t sleep at all because I have like a pain in my chest from embarrassment. I silently cried myself to sleep at about 4 am and woke up at 6. My eyes are practically swollen shut and I look the worst I’ve ever looked but we’re going to get a coffee soon and he’s taking me to get my car before he goes to work. Luckily he owns a business so he said he could take the morning off. But also… he owns a business and a house, so that makes this extra embarrassing. When I woke up, it felt like how my friends tell me they feel after a night of drinking and bad choices lol. I don’t drink but now I can tell them I felt it too

I don’t know how I ended up being a burden on a friend like this. I genuinely was looking for a place and working at fixing my finances.. it took longer than I expected and then lying made things worse

2) I cried for weeks, took a month off work, joined several support groups through Postpartum support international, RTZ and Star legacy. I also found a local therapist who specializes in pregnancy loss and trauma.  

3) After my two week checkup after tfmr my OB cleared me to TTC. I started tracking immediately but my period did not return for 10 weeks (February) it was torture. As soon as my first cycle ended I tracked ovulation with strips. By late April I was pregnant. We BD on most days leading up to ovulation I think it was -3, -1, O and O+1. I also went to accupuncture, got a massage and continued with my prenatals. I did not take any special supplements. Ate my usual vegetarian diet,'lots of water, no coffee or caffeine. 


Thankfully sub pregnancy is going great and I am scheduled for an induction Dec 26. The point is mamas, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

⭐ Why People Love the Victory Steps

Out of everything I tried, this felt the most “human.” Good for essays where tone matters, or where you need a clear argument instead of reshuffled sentences. The writing was structured, not repetitive, and didn’t scream bot energy.

**Pros:** thoughtful writing, great for courses with picky professors.  
**Cons:** not the cheapest, but you get real quality.

# 3. [EssayMarket ](https://essaymarket.net/?rt=K5hNcEfw)- best for: tight budgets and standard coursework

Most cheap services were a disaster - broken English, filler paragraphs, you name it.  
EssayMarket was the exception. Solid enough for basic assignments, summaries, reviews, etc. You won’t get a philosophical masterpiece, but it won’t tank your grade either.

**Pros:** affordable, usable work.  
**Cons:** not ideal for heavy analytical tasks.

Different services shine in different situations. For me, SpeedyPaper was the go-to for rush jobs, EssayFox delivered the best depth and clarity, and EssayMarket was the most reliable budget option. No service is perfect, but these three at least didn’t give me AI mush, plagiarism, or emotional damage.",1,1765457028.0,StudentStorm,0,1.0,False

1pjwjym,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pjwjym/i_tested_out_a_drug_and_now_i_cant_stop_eating/,I tested out a drug and now I can’t stop eating people,"Let me just start with a little backstory;

I was dead broke. Fresh out of high school and struggling to pay for college. My job at the local mall wasn’t cutting it, and time was running out fast for me to cover next semesters tuition. 

During one of my very limited off-days, I had been in the grocery store, picking up a few things to hold me over for the next two weeks. 

As I stood over the frozen meat section, lost in a trance with my mind in a million places at once, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 

“Good morning, sir, how are you doing this morning?” 

I glanced over his uniform. It was too refined and decorated to be that of a recruiter. 

Looking down at my own outfit I realized that I looked, in fact, quite homeless. 

“Ah, you know. Making it through.”

“That’s excellent to hear, sir. Hey, I have a question: have you ever given any thought to the U.S. Military?” 

He asked as if he KNEW my answer, as if he could read it on my face. 

“Listen, man, I’m in college. Barely making it by, but, you know.” 

“Yes sir, I do. Mind if I ask what you’re going to school for?”

I answered honestly by telling him that I was going to be an engineer, to which he replied enthusiastically. 

“Ohhhh, man. The army is begging for some engineers. And guess what? All your schooling paid for. You help us, we help you.” 

I thought about it for a moment. I hated to admit it, but his words were swaying me a bit, and he could sense it. That was a dangerous place to be in. 

Before I got the chance to respond he spoke again. 

“Pays good too.” 

I knew I had to put a stop to this now before he got more of his foot in the door so I responded with a quick, “I’ll think about it,” as I shuffled away. 

As I walked with my back toward him he called out once more. 

“Please do! We’ll be seeing ya.” 

He then seemed to speak into what I assumed was a mic that must’ve been tucked neatly under his collar. I couldn’t make out what he said, just that his face had shifted from approachable to, what can best be described as a look of complete authority as he meandered back towards the entrance of the store. 

I hadn’t thought much of it and continued shopping as usual. 

I had work the next day and as I returned home from an absolutely soul crushing shift, I found that an envelope had been placed in the seam of my doorframe. 

It was marked with a stamp bearing the logo of the United States Army. 

“Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really don’t play about their recruitment.” 

I was about to push my way inside, ready to collapse in bed when my foot landed on yet another sheet of paper. 

“EVICTION NOTICE” in bright red lettering. 

The tape must’ve slipped right off the metal door. 

I don’t know if it was because of my exhausting shift or if my mind had just completely given up, but I simply stepped over the notice and made my way to my bedroom, tossing the envelope on the coffee table. 

I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

The next morning, I had to fight to get out of bed. Everything seemed hopeless and, I can admit, this is the moment where I had lost faith in myself entirely. 

I remembered the words of the guy from the store. 

Schooling paid for, guaranteed benefits, guaranteed housing, plus a guaranteed job. 

Fuck it. 

I ripped the envelope open and removed its contents anxiously. 

What I read….surprised me. 

This wasn’t a recruitment letter. 

Well, it was. Just not for military recruitment. 

They weren’t asking me for my service, they weren’t even asking me to consider. This letter was to recruit people to test out a new drug that the army had been developing. 

There weren’t many details on the drug itself or its effects. But it DID include that payment for this little trial would be 5 thousand dollars for one day of my time. 

The letter looked official. It was even watermarked with the bald eagle symbol that you see the government use. 

It provided a phone number and urged me to “Call immediately if interested.”

I called and on the third ring, a man picked up. 

I recognized the voice immediately. It was the man from the store. 

“Afternoon, Donavin. I’m assuming you got our letter?” 

“Yeah, I did- wait how do you even know where I live?” 

He responded confidently. 

“It’s our job to know, son. Now, I’m assuming you’re calling because you’re interested in our trial, correct?” 

For a moment, I froze. I’d never even smoked weed before and now they want to give me 5 thousand dollars to try a drug meant for soldiers. Then I remembered the eviction notice, and it were as though my mouth spoke without permission. 

“Absolutely. I’m more than interested.” 

“Excellent, excellent. We’re sending the address over now.” 

Just as the last word escaped his lips my phone chimed with an email notification. 

It was completely blank save for the single address. It didn’t even appear to have a sender. Just an anomalous email amongst the thousands in my mailbox. 

Before I could speak, the line went dead and silenced fill the apartment once more. 

But fuck, FUCK, he hadn’t given me a time. 

“Oh, well,” I thought. “I’ll just go now.” 

Hopping in my car and inputting the address into the maps app on my phone, I found that the location was 2 hours from my home. 

“It’s 5000 dollars, it’s 5000 dollars,” I kept repeating to myself as the car ride dragged on. 

After about 45 minutes, I found that I was in the middle of nowhere and still had 75 minutes to go. 

I drove on, repeating my mantra as I passed trees, fields, and more trees. 

Finally, just on the horizon, surrounded by towering oak trees, was the most secret-government-looking facility I had ever seen. 

It must’ve been 20 stories tall, no windows, a single door directly in the center, and no cars in sight.  

I thought this was probably the strangest detail of all. 

Surely, SOMEONE had to be here besides me. 

This should’ve been the sign that made me turn around and figure things out on my own. I didn’t know just how out of my depth I really was. 

But, of course. “It’s 5000 dollars.” 

I pulled my car into the empty parking lot and started for the door. 

I opened it up and was greeted by darkness. An empty warehouse. I had been duped. 

Duped on an astonishingly professional level, but duped nonetheless. 

However, just as I began to turn and walk away, I could hear footsteps, and row by row the overhead fluorescent lights began to flicker on. 

Walking towards me with a false, corporate smile…was the man from the store. 

“Donavin,” he cheered. “So glad you could make it.” 

I glanced around suspiciously. 

“You the only person here?” 

He responded, almost eagerly:

“I’m the only person you need.” 

As he approached he extended an arm and wrapped it firmly around my shoulders.

“Follow me right this way, young man.”

As we walked a sudden feeling of dread began to come over me. Dread quickly morphed into regret and I attempted to pull away from the man. 

To my dismay, his arm did not budge. He was essentially *dragging* me across the concrete floor as I struggled timidly. 

As he pulled me he just kept…reassuring me? 

“This is what you wanted, you’re evicted, you need this. How are you going to pay for school? I promise, this will all be over soon.” 

The lights continued flickering on as we moved through the warehouse. 

Eventually, the place was illuminated enough to reveal a door that I had not noticed before; and we were headed towards it fast. 

I’m not sure how, but I managed to get my nerves under control. 

Maybe I WAS overreacting. I mean, it’s the military. I’m not selling an organ to someone on the black market or anything like that. I told myself I’d be fine. 

Once we entered the room, I was blinded by the sheer whiteness of everything, so much so that I had to squint my eyes to avoid a headache. 

Right dead in the center of the room, was a steel chair with leather restraints attached to the arm rests. 

I felt the man’s grip on me loosen as he gestured to the chair with his hand. 

“Please, Mr Meeks; have a seat.” 

Cautiously, I sat down and he began strapping my arms down tight. 

“Hey, so, uh, this isn’t really *needed* right? Just a precaution?” 

His lack of an answer concerned me. He just continued tightening the restraints. 

“Oh yeah, when do I get my mon-“ 

The man interrupted. He was no longer turned towards me, but instead was facing a mirror on the wall just to the right of me. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we have here today: subject 1 for the conduction of the GH75 Trial. As you can see, the subject is restrained and is of no threat to anyone. I ask that you please take notes, and be prepared to discuss what you’ve learned once the trial has concluded.” 

No threat to anyone? What an odd thing to say. 

Amidst my confusion, the mirror seemed to…disappear. What was once mine and the man’s reflection, was now a window. 

On the opposite side sat about a dozen men and women dressed in military uniform, each one studiously looking on, gripping their pads and pens firmly. 

“Just as a precaution,” the man continued. 

On queue, two armed guards with swat shields aggressively entered the room, rifles trained on me. 

“This drug is experimental after all.” 

I knew I had made a mistake. 

Nothing about this was normal, but hell, what was I gonna do now? 

The man finally turned to me once more before whispering to me through a twisted smile: 

“Thank you for your service.” 

Before I knew it, a quick bit of pain radiated from the crease of my right arm. 

He had stuck the needle in and injected me. 

There was no going back now. 

I expected to feel, I don’t know, organ failure or something like that. But, no. Instead, what I felt, was complete and total euphoria. 

Not like heroin, at least I don’t think; more like the strength in my body had been amplified. 

I felt…capable. 

This feeling grew and before I could register anything, I felt MORE than capable. 

I felt…disrespected that they believed these restraints could hold me and my forearm muscles began to tighten and push hard against the leather straps. 

I could see my veins pulsating. They pushed so hard against my skin that they looked as though they were glowing. 

My heart began to beat out of my chest and my brain was pounding. The pain made me angry. So, so angry. 

I couldn’t help but gnash my teeth and struggle violently against the puny restraints. 

I could feel my face radiating with heat and I must’ve looked completely insane judging by the nervous looks on the guards faces. 

“Wipe that fear off your faces, soldiers,” the man screamed. 

“You are marines!” 

The man looked totally in control. This made me even angrier. 

At this point it felt like there was fire beneath my skin begging to be released, and my mouth overflowed with froth. 

My anger was reaching an absolute boiling point and all that I could feel throughout my entire body was pure unbridled rage. 

I could feel the chair shaking as I thrashed and growled like a mad man, and even so, the man remained completely calm. 

I knew I was going to kill him. I knew that there was no way he’d leave this building alive. None of them would leave this building alive. They were all dead and none of them even knew it yet. 

In one final explosive burst of energy the leather restraints snapped and with supernatural speed I had sprung from the chair. 

Both guards opened fire on me immediately, but I wouldn’t go down. I could see their terrified faces, the faces of the people behind the glass, and it fueled me. 

I hobbled towards the guards, against their barrage of gunfire. 

With one swipe of my hand, I ripped the shield from the guard on the right, tearing his arm completely off of his body in the process. 

His partner had begun beating me over the head with his rifle. 

Snatching it from his hand, I heard the shattering sound of each of his fingers that he had wrapped so tightly around the weapon. 

Both guards were screaming now and, God, my GOD WAS IT INFURIATING, 

I forced the barrel of the gun deep into the guards throat. He made a gargled, wet sound, before I pulled the trigger and emptied the rest of his magazine into his stomach. 

He fell to the floor lifeless, leaving his partner alone and critically injured. 

I didn’t need to do anything to him. Enough had already been done. He would die knowing he failed. 

I looked back at the man. 

There it was. 

There was that satisfying look of terror I had been so desperately trying to evoke. 

He fumbled, clumsily, to open the door to get to the other side of the glass window. His trembling made it impossible, however. 

I drew out the moment. Savored every step I took towards him. Every beat of his heart and trickle of his sweat. 

As I stood over him he fell to his knees, like a coward. Begging for his life. 

Tears were rolling down his face as he asked God for forgiveness; asked ME for forgiveness. 

But I was beyond reason. 

The first punch knocked him out cold. I could hear his neck splinter from the second one. But I wasn’t satisfied. 

I drove my fist into his head over and over again. 

I could hear his bladder failing as fluids began to pool around his previously spotless trousers. 

I couldn’t stop. 

Once I hit brain, that’s when the seizing began. 

His thralls were unnatural and sharp. 

Though they had been mostly destroyed, his eyes rolled into his skull and his body looked like it was being lifted off the ground from his midsection as he continued to seize. 

With one final punch, his head cracked open from the front to the back. Brain matter oozed out of the wound and I stared in awe at the bloody mess in front of me. 

In the midst of my rage, I had neglected to feel the void that had opened in my stomach. 

I had never been hungrier. 

My mind told me one thing:

“You know what you want to do…”

Without even a hint of hesitation, I began picking at the brain matter that leaked from the mans destroyed head. 

It started off small, but before I could help it I was shoveling fist fulls of this guys memories directly into my mouth. 

The taste was indescribable. 

I couldn’t stop, period. 

I devoured what was left of his face before moving on to the guards. 

The more I ate, the more I felt the drugs effects kick in. 

I had almost forgotten about the people behind the window. 

They couldn’t have been so lucky. 

The window, the false mirror, it was nothing. It shattered from just one hit and they began trampling over each other trying to leave the room. 

I tore them apart, friends. 

Limb from limb, bite by bite. 

They’re all gone now. 

They’re all mine. 

I exited that warehouse covered from head to toe in their precious lifeblood, carrying with me the vile of the mystery drug that I found in the recruiters coat pocket. 

I could barely contain myself on the drive home. 

And that’s where I am now. 

I’m not concerned with the eviction, school, and certainly not money. 

My mind has been reprogrammed. That’s what the drug does. It’s a violent drug made for soldiers who were meant to die. A last stand drug. 

I have no intentions on dying. 

I have no intentions to stop. 

The only intention that remains in my mind…is simple:

Find more food.

The short answer? Yes, they're absolutely worth it if you want to build core strength at home.

An ab roller wheel is one of those simple pieces of equipment that doesn't take up much space but delivers real results. Unlike bulky machines or expensive gym memberships, you can store this thing under your bed and pull it out whenever you're ready to work out.

**What Makes Ab Rollers Effective?**

When you use an ab roller, you're not just working your abs. You're engaging your entire core, including your lower back, obliques, and even your shoulders and arms. It's a full upper body workout that forces your muscles to stabilize your body as you roll forward and back.

The movement is tough, no doubt about it. Even fitness enthusiasts find ab wheel exercises challenging because you're fighting gravity while keeping your body straight. That's exactly why they work so well.

**Benefits You'll Actually Notice**

Your core gets stronger, which helps with everyday activities like lifting boxes or playing with kids. Better posture is another bonus since you're constantly engaging those stabilizer muscles. Plus, if you're looking to get visible abs, this tool helps burn calories while building muscle definition.

**Are There Any Downsides?**

If you're a complete beginner, the learning curve can be steep. You might need to start on your knees instead of your toes. People with lower back issues should be careful, though proper form usually prevents problems. The key is starting slow and not overextending.

**Is It Worth Your Money?**

For the price, an ab roller wheel gives you incredible value. Most cost less than a month of fancy coffee drinks, and they last for years. You can check out quality options here: https://athomewave.com/ab-roller-wheel

They're portable, durable, and effective. You don't need batteries, apps, or subscriptions. Just you, the wheel, and a few minutes of floor space.

**Getting Started**

Begin with knee rollouts and focus on controlled movements. Keep your core tight and don't let your back sag. Even five good reps are better than fifteen sloppy ones. As you get stronger, you can progress to full rollouts from your toes or try diagonal rolls to hit your obliques.

**Bottom Line**

If you want straightforward core training without gimmicks, an ab roller wheel delivers. It's challenging enough to keep advanced exercisers engaged but simple enough that beginners can learn the basics quickly. For anyone serious about strengthening their midsection at home, it's a solid investment.

1pjwgpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pjwgpf/my_dad_is_dying_too_soon/,My dad is dying - too soon,"Hi all.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this - I don't usually post at all, but I feel so heavy with sadness and I don't have anyone to speak to (not that I don't have any friends or family - I'm just a very private person who tries his best to be emotionally self-reliant).

My dad is dying of pulmonary fibrosis - even saying this feels so, so very uncanny. How did it come to this? This a lung disease for which there is no cure, just the slow progression of scarring until the lungs can no longer support life. He was diagnosed just this June, but has been occasionally in and out of hospital for various other ailments beginning in 2022; other than that he had been functional, just getting thinner, weaker, and more breathless. Two weeks back he asked to be admitted to A&E because he had trouble breathing while walking just a few steps. The disease has progressed rapidly since, and now he's in palliative care, waiting for a room at the hospice. He doesn't have much time left. My dad is only 66. He told me a few days ago that he is frightened - he doesn't want to go.

Today I visited him - he's still conscious and speaking, but so tired. They're stopping the antifibrotic medication tomorrow because he has difficulty swallowing pills, and the meds haven't had any significant impact on disease progression. I don't think he has much longer.

Cognitively, I understand what death is - I've spent many hours thinking and studying about it: how things must necessary leave, the different ways of making sense of 'going' (a return to nonexistence, heaven etc.), imagining what it must be like to go. But I don't know what this is anymore.

I'm very afraid of the *never*\-ness of things - he's never going to be home again, never going to be in his chair at the dining table, never going to drive me places, I'll never hear his voice, never again. I find myself panicking trying to remember the last of everything - when he last drove me, when he last bought me something, the last time he hugged me - and trying to hold on to those moments, trying to fix the date, the day. I need to remember - I can't, and my head hurts.

I have things to buy (a new chair, a new computer, a new coffee machine) - but I cannot bring myself to buy them because they will be part of a world/future in which my dad is no longer around. Every day, I feel the world shrinking and changing - everything feels stranger and stranger. My dad is receding, pulling away, like the sun beyond a horizon. He's becoming less and less a part of my life with each day, and I don't know how to manage this feeling of terrible, terrible dread.

He is likely not going to be here when I finally start my PhD next August - he won't be here when I graduate four years from now. This has been a dream of mine, something I've been working so hard for - but he won't be here to see it come true, to tell his friends and family that his son is a doctor.

But most tragic of all, I find myself imagining what it must be like being him, watching the world slowly fade until it is the size of the ward or hospital bed. The world, your loved ones, going about their day (as they must) - so full of potential and possibilities - while you wait for only one thing to happen.

I'm sorry if this all sounds so bleak. There is so much pain. I'm so thankful we don't live forever.

1pjweot,https://i.redd.it/ucl38vldkk6g1.jpeg,Breakfast Rolls Recipe Easy and Irresistibly Delicious,"I’ve been on the hunt for easy, portable breakfast ideas because mornings can be chaotic around here. Whether it’s trying to feed my family quickly, making a grab-and-go brunch, or prepping something simple for a weekend breakfast board, these breakfast rolls have become a go-to for me. They’re fun, versatile, and work for just about any occasion. If you want the full breakdown, I’ve written it all out here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/breakfast-rolls-recipe](https://www.amgroyal.com/breakfast-rolls-recipe)  
  
Here’s what you’ll need:  
  
8 large flour tortillas  
6 large eggs  
1/3 cup milk  
1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or a mix)  
1 cup cooked and crumbled sausage or chopped bacon  
1/4 cup diced bell peppers (optional)  
2 green onions, thinly sliced (optional)  
1 tablespoon butter  
Salt and pepper to taste  
  
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper.  
2. Heat butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring often, until soft scrambled. Remove from heat and set aside.  
3. Lay out the tortillas and sprinkle about a tablespoon of shredded cheese in the center of each.  
4. Divide the scrambled eggs, cooked sausage or bacon, and any optional veggies like bell peppers or green onions evenly among the tortillas.  
5. Top with the remaining shredded cheese.  
6. Roll up each tortilla burrito-style, folding in the sides and rolling tightly so nothing falls out.  
7. For that golden, crisp exterior, heat a clean skillet over medium heat. Place the rolled tortillas seam-side down and toast for about 1-2 minutes per side, until lightly browned.  
8. Slice them in half if serving on a breakfast platter or wrap them individually in foil for a brunch to go option.  
  
Notes and tips:  
\- These rolls are highly customizable. Swap the sausage for ham, or skip the meat altogether and load up with just veggies and cheese for a vegetarian option.  
\- For meal prep, you can make these ahead, freeze them individually, and reheat in the oven or air fryer when you need them.  
\- If you’re planning a Thanksgiving breakfast board or Christmas breakfast party food lineup, these rolls are a great finger food addition, and they go well with fruit, pastries, and coffee.  
\- Perfect for breakfast for 4 people, but the recipe doubles easily if you’ve got a crowd coming over.

I’m probably 20lbs overweight. The last time I really felt confident in my body was on my wedding day 4.5 years ago. I’m starting to workout again, and I’m getting a fitness ring for Christmas. But diet is really where I get stuck. My parents are morbidly obese and so there is an underlying fear of becoming obese as well. I remember feeling best with an anti inflammatory diet that lasted about 2 weeks before I fell off the wagon. I have the Lose it App that I’ve been using on and off to log calories and that definitely helps me from overeating but I’m not consistent with it. I also love food and especially creamer in my coffee and know I do too much but I’ve tried coffee black and it’s just not a sacrifice I’m willing to make. I want to lose weight and more importantly feel better in my body and clothes but I can’t seem to get my shit together to actually get motivated enough to change and keep going. Why can’t my new hyperfixation be health and losing weight? Maybe I can trick my brain in the new year to really buckle down. It’s like my brain enjoys the problem-solving (ex. Get a new diet, calorie deficit, workout, apps and tracking etc) but doesn’t realllly want to lock in to doing it. I’m in a battle with myself! Can anyone relate? What are some ways you’ve overcome this? ADHD hacks for healthy eating? Hit me up.

She didn’t let go for a long while, and when she did, he felt strange. He could see she had cried, but she quickly wiped her tears.  “Okay, there is a ship. How long has it been here?” 

He wanted to ask her about the tears, but she was clearly in business mode. “Ship! How long has the ship been here?”

The answer popped up. ‘Unknown. Between two months and a hundred years. Most likely less than five years.’

“Why is it so difficult to estimate the time?” He asked, and the answer popped up.

‘The ship is located in the middle of the desert, there is no trace of the original crash or impact, and the ship appears to have been hidden under sand. The dry environment has also protected it from some corrosion. The time it has spent buried has both protected and harmed the vessel, making it difficult from this distance to gain an accurate estimate of the ship's crash.’

“Is the air breathable there?”

‘Yes, the air is breathable in that area.’

He turned to Kiko. “So, how are we getting there? That’s 9560 kilometers away, the ship won't fly now.”

“What about the speeders? They should be able to travel that distance.  We would need to recharge when we get there, though.” She replied.

“Are you crazy? At full speed, we are talking two days.  You want to fly over this land on a sports speeder?  They can barely carry anything too.”

“So we are just going to leave it? there might be something there we can use. Alloys we can't make on this planet.  I know it's dangerous, but are we just going to stay inside the ship until it's fixed? That might take years.”

“Okay. I’ll go. I’d like the scooters together so I can put a container between them. It won't look nice, but it will work, and I won't be able to go full speed. It might take a week.”

“You're not leaving me alone here for a week! I’m coming with you.”

“Oh, so we are both going to die out there?” he replied.

“Are you planning to die out there?” She replied.

“No, of course not.”

“Neither am I. Just give up. We are going, so let's start working. I saw there were a few empty containers in the back. We can use one of them.”

He thought about it, he could take the hover modules off the scooters, put them under the container, and link them to the scooters. They should be able to pull them, and the scooters should be at least 500 meters above ground. They only had to land to sleep and recharge the engines. They should be able to drive at least 700 kilometers a day like that. That meant about fourteen days each way, they would need to add an extra layer of ice and gas for that period.  He guessed he would need at least a week to get it fixed. Shed was looking at him now with a smile.

“What?”

“I can see that you're thinking about a solution, that marvelous brain of yours is working overtime now.”

“Yes, I can do it, but it will take at least a week to get it ready, and the speed of the scooters will be drastically reduced. I’m lucky if I can get to a quarter of their speed.”

“What's their top speed? 300 kilometers an hour?” she asked.

“Around that, yeah, I would guess a week each way, so we have to secure the ship better just in case.”

“You work on the scooters, I secure the ship, and let me know if there is anything I can do to help you, right? I’ll have the satellite start searching for more wrecks, that unstable wormhole might have sent a few here.”

“That might be a good idea.  Who knows what else that wormhole has snatched up?  Now that I think about it, the only reason we survived the landing was the third redundant system we installed. If we didn’t, then we would be free-falling from the atmosphere.”

“Shit, I didn't know that.” She replied, shocked. “You mean the only reason we are alive is your paranoid captain?”

“He wasn’t paranoid, just had a phobia about being stranded in deep space.” He replied.

“Well, I’m glad he did.  I’m surprised he didn’t have a shuttle installed. “

“We had three, he sold two to cover his debt, and the last was lost during the attack.” She got up and kissed him.

“Go work, and I will do my thing. Keep the line open.”  Then she vanished down the hall to the cockpit. He smiled a bit before heading to the cargo room and taking out the scooters. He started examining them, went to the workbench, and brought up their designs.  

He needed to boost the already installed gravity generators on the large container. It was five meters long, three meters wide, and two and a half meters high.  They would need her generator inside to boost the power as well, so he started to work on setting it up. He started working; he needed to get the main generator on the engine back online before he could finish here.

“Peter? Can you come up here?” He stopped working and looked at his watch. He had been working for seven hours, and he could stop here without risking damaging anything.

“Sure, on my way. Anything serious?” He asked as he got ready and made his way to the cockpit.

“You will see.” She said, and he moved a little too fast and soon came up to the kitchen, where she was watching the big screen, seeing new images from the drone. He looked at the image, which showed a sail ship, and the drone had zoomed in on the crew.

“That’s a Fushan and Jobar crew. What the hell?”

“Yeah, so now we have four species here. They are pretty far out, too. Closer to the mainland.” She said as she brought up the world map. They had landed on a large peninsula, only connected to the mainland by a thin strip of land. Then she switched to another picture of the said peninsula-mainland connection, where somebody had built a huge wall.

“There is so much stuff here. The scanners missed most of it. It seems like it was only focused on technology. That wall is either to keep others from reaching this place or to keep them from going to the mainland.” She said, as she put a cup of coffee in his hand. He looked at it and took a sip.

“You'd better be careful, if this becomes a habit, I might propose.”

She just grinned before continuing.

“Anyway. I’m not risking the drone to go further away, I’m just glad the camera is so damn good.  If we can find enough to repair the other drone, then we could actually do some more investigations. Oh, and… “she changed it to the camera outside the cave. The camp was there, but nobody was left. “The weed is gone!”

“Good, did you track them?”

“Of course. What do you take me for?  They live at the base of the mountain on the northern side. It seems like that’s the area where the gas is going to. I have stopped the release of the gas for now, not that they will notice. If we double the ice wall and blast a hole four hundred meters out west wall, there is a fifty-meter drop at the entrance to get in. We can collapse the tunnel for about a hundred meters. I doubt they can dig that long just to check.”

“Yeah, that can work. There is one problem.  The scooters won’t be able to provide enough energy, so we have to take your generator.”

“My generator?” she looked at him and laughed.  “You can take it.”

“Yeah, I will, but if I take it now before the ship's generator is fixed, then the ship will only have the battery left, and that’s only two weeks on emergency power.”

“So, how long until the generator is fixed?”

“I have to check, but about a week, so not that bad. I’m actually almost finished. That container already had anti-gravity systems, but they could only lift about ten meters. I’m boosting them now to five hundred by using parts from the other scooters.”

“How did you learn that?”

“Back home, worked on scooters and shuttles all the time as a teen. I could probably build a shuttle if I got hold of the correct parts.” He said as he sipped his coffee and then looked at the fridge. “Okay, I’ll make us dinner.”

“No, you don’t, you sit, and I'll do that.” She said as she opened the fridge, took out some ingredients, put them in the food fabricator, and started it. He just watched with a smile.

“What are you after?”

She just winked.

The next day, he finished the construction, and without the extra energy, he raised it ten meters with ease, before parking it.  Then he went to check on the repair progress and saw what materials they were missing. He was thinking of cannibalizing part of the ship to supply it when the droids returned with the first load of mined resources. Kiko was going through the ship and making a proper inventory list, and by the look of it, the ship was filled with forgotten treasures and mementoes, as well as lots of crap.

He made Kiko dinner from scratch the same day, she watched him like he was doing something mysterious.  

The next day, they went through the others' cabins and packed away their personal belongings. She was surprised by the number of weapons they found. Peter was sure there was more hidden somewhere. He had not revealed his one hidden stash.  They moved into the cabin that night and left two days later as the alarm went off. The engine room was safe enough to start the power generator; however, the AI warned about takeoff.  

 

When they turned on the ship's power generator, the ship immediately seemed more alive; several system that had been turned off was turned on, the ship's self-cleaning program immediately turned on and started to clean the interior. Kiko laughed as she saw it.

“Are you serious? You guys installed a cleaning program? Is that lavender I smell? Oh, my god. Some hardcore criminals, you guys are!”

“Hey, just because we are hardcore doesn’t mean we can't enjoy some luxury!” he replied.

Peter started the process of disconnecting the smaller generator and connected it to the containers ' antigrav engines.

An hour later, they had transferred the generator, and Kiko helped move in some camping equipment, an oxygen generator, and food for the trip.  He helped her into a space suit that had belonged to Maya.

She was about to say something when she noticed something about the suits.

“This is military grade. They can really take a beating.”

“Yes, I need to keep you protected. Anyway, there is a pistol at your leg, a dagger hidden at your leg, and a tool kit on your left leg. Not a big one. We stay on channel two for good luck. Ready?”

“Yes sir! Don’t worry, I know how to use a suit.” She replied as she tried to hit his butt.

He just smiled and helped her up on the scooter before going up on his own. “They are linked, so for this part, you can just relax. I will take the first stretch.”

They flew down the tunnel they had made, and halfway through, some parts collapsed behind them before they blasted open the last part and flew out.

It was still day as they started their road trip.

Hey everyone,  
I'm Christopher and I need to come clean about something: I've been building VocArt for 4 years but I've been absolutely terrible at marketing it. Like, developer-level terrible. I finally decided to stop hiding and start doing this right, so I'm treating this as a fresh start and hoping you'll help me pick a right way.

👉 What is VocArt?  
It's a vocabulary learning app where you explore beautiful illustrated scenes and tap on objects to learn words in 16 languages. Think interactive picture dictionary meets art gallery. You see a cozy kitchen scene, tap on the coffee maker, and instantly learn the word in Spanish, Japanese, Arabic - whatever you're learning - with pronunciation audio, romanization, and grammar info.

👉 The honest backstory:  
I built this thing completely solo (except for the gorgeous illustrations from artists in Vietnam, Turkey, and Indonesia). Launched 4 years ago. Got it to 4.7-4.9 stars on both stores. Even got featured in Vietnam once and hit 15K users briefly.

But here's the thing - I'm a developer, not a marketer. I ran out of money for ads. I started an Instagram that went nowhere. I've been stuck at \~1K monthly users for way too long while I kept adding features instead of telling people the app exists.

👉 I'm running out of energy to keep this going alone.  
So I'm doing what I should have done years ago: actually talking to people, asking for feedback, and learning how to market properly. I'm treating this as a relaunch. A fresh start.

👉 What's in the app right now:  
\- 3 artwork themes (Food & Kitchen, Holidays & Travels, House) with 10 chapters each  
\- 16 languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Ukrainian  
\- Tap-to-learn tooltips with translations, romanization, articles/gender  
\- High-quality pronunciation audio (paid feature at $2.99)  
\- Progress tracking with color-coded markers  
\- Offline-friendly  
\- Beautiful landscape dual-panel navigation

👉 What's coming in v4.0 (soon):  
\- Switching to subscription model (more sustainable)  
\- New ""Phrases & Expressions"" artwork  
\- Simple challenges/missions to make learning more engaging (might come bit later)  
\- More languages

👉 Why I think it's actually good:  
\- 4.7 stars on App Store & Google Play (almost 1k ratings)  
\- People who find it genuinely love it  
\- Perfect for visual learners and beginners  
\- No overwhelming drills - just explore at your own pace

👉 What I need from you:  
I'm not here to just promote. I genuinely want your honest feedback:  
\- If you try it, what feels off? What's confusing?  
\- What would make you actually use this daily?  
\- Am I positioning this wrong? A ""picture dictionary"" is the keyword that describes it best but not tracking much traffic.  
\- What is missing that would make this a must-have for language learners?

I know there are a million language apps out there. But I believe the art-first, zero-pressure approach has real value. I just need help figuring out how to reach the people who would actually love it.

👉 Try it if you're curious:  
VocArt download link for iOS/Android: ([https://vocart.app/download/](https://vocart.app/download/))

And if you have any advice on marketing, growth, or just... not giving up, I'm all ears. Because right now I'm at that crossroads where I either figure this out or watch 4 years of work fade away.

Thanks for reading this far. Really appreciate any feedback you can share.

    P.S.
    - I'm also looking for a marketing partner or co-founder if anyone's interested, but that's a whole other post😅",1,1765455932.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

I’m doing PG, she’s working. she recently (2d ago) moved out from her company quarters to new society, so i can visit during weekends and chill.

actually after a crazy road rage, another crazy thing happened.

aa road rage trwtha, we stopped at a coffee shop, took some time to process that then we thought of skipping road trip and decided to go for Dhurandhar. oka ~20KM ride chesi movie chusi we returned back around 10’00 PM.

actually scene enti ante, like I’ve mentioned she shifted to this house just 2-3 days ago, I live like 60KM away and visit during weekends to her place. present ee new house lo painting and plumbing work jaruguthu undedi, we packed all our things and left while the work is gng on in the home (my gf’s manager vouched for the contractor, also we don’t have any precious things, so we left while these 2 guys are working at home) which we realised later that we shouldn’t have. 🫠
when we stopped at the cafe, I got this notification from Find My that my airpods were left behind, I was sure that I have packed it in my bag so I didn’t worry at all. return ochesaka, we had dinner and slept.

nxt morning I woke up at 6AM, bcos I have to catch this local train that departs at 6’30AM.
lecha, fresh ayya, bag eskuni shoes eskuni, airpods kosam chuste levu, yekdo intlone petti marchipoyunta, find my open chesi play sound kodadam ani open cheste last location 6km away 6h ago ani chupinchindi, that’s it, mind fuck naku. aa location yekda ani chuste that wasn’t in our yesterday’s route also i didn’t carry it yesterday so i came to realise that these guys robbed but I cannot prove/accuse them bcos my gf has to live at this place and also it’s obvious that the person who stole won’t admit that he stole and return back the stolen item so I thought like raasi petti ledhu but oksari aa last location ki velli chuddama anipinchindi, but I cannot miss my train, after some thinking i decided to go search for airpods since they value so much and i bought them just 3mo back and i just can’t literally survive without them.

nenu thanu inka start ayyem, start ayye apdu pitch dark undedi bhyta eventhough it’s 6’10AM, also so f freezing (agency area), aa last location ki velli chuste em ledhu akkada, chinna resort (peru ki resort but more like a motel) and gates locked. call cheddam ante num ledhu board medha. so i tress-passed and went to the exact location but there’s nothing, i lost hope and went back to where I parked my bike. I made peace and decided to go back to home but I opened “find my” app and tapped on “notify when found” and also opened directions and gave it to my gf to hold while on our way back home. while we were gng back, my phone beeped and showed me this notification that they’re near, I instantly applied brakes and stopped and checked the location it showed just beside us (now), my gf went to that home, talked to the lady, she went inside called her husband, he came, we asked about those two painters, he said he didn’t know, i tried playing sound but it wasn’t connected. then I thought like maybe I’ve covered some distance when applying brakes, so i tapped on directions and went back walking then it showed “far” and “connected” that’s it….fuckkk!! then I looked around and there’s one room right to the road, I got down and moved forward to that room, then jt got disonnected but when I came back to the room it was getting connected, I called my gf and informed the same, she came screaming and said that she gave details of how those two painters look to the other home we went earlier and they said that one of those painter lives in the exact same room i was roaming around, we went to the door and I played sound and I can hear my airpods beeping from inside 😭😭😭.
my gf knocked on the door, his wife opened, 

my gf - Sorry for disturbing! yesterday, ur hubby came to paint our home. mistakenly, our device might have slipped into his bag. location is showing to ur home on our phone and u can hear the beeping of the device from inside, that’s ours, can you please return it.

(his wife called him)
he came, looked at us, shocked. couldn’t speak, said ba ba ba, nothing else. her wife explained the situation to him, he went inside, got his bag, picked my APP from his bag (I kept playing sound continously) handed it over to us, his wife shocked (I think she understood what just happened), we rocked. went back to the previous home we went first, thanked them. they talked with us for 5 good minutes, exchanged numbers, offered us chai, but we were really happy we said no, thank you. returned back, took a pic to remember this memory. 

TL DR - lost airpods during house work (painter stole), made peace that I can’t find them again (cannot accuse them as I’m non local) , used find my, went to last seen location, did some digging, found.

I went to my gyno about 3 years ago and she wanted to do some testing one was a fasting glucose/insulin test. I had to drink a sugary drink and get labs done every 30 mins for 2 hours. After that she suspected insulin resistance as glucose was stable but insulin was high. She started me on strict keto and I did that for about a year but my weight went from 120lbs to 105lbs and I told her if I stuck with the diet I was worried id lose more weight (saying I wasn't overweight to begin with) and she told me let's reintroduce carbs again. So okay perfect. She ended up leaving the area and the next gyno said ""youre to young for diabetes"" and brushed it off. Okay cool. Will add ive never taken any medicine just a change in diet. For the past year of my life ive ate pretty much anything ive wanted 😅 I m now about 120-125 ishlbs so back to my normal weight. I also have Lupus and POTS as well as some other issues like chronic migraines seizures those kinds of things I do take a lot of other medications. At my last rheumatologist appointment for my lupus he did some labs and my glucose was 56. Which is very low. It struck me funny because my labs were done about 2pm and around noon I had a sandwhich and a small bag of chips so I had carbs and it was still very low! When I brought it up to the rheumatologist he said the same ""probably a fluke youre to young for diabetes"" so I broke out my finger poke blood sugar machine that I was using back with the insulin resistance keto diet time of my life and started testing. Still eating quite average. I do use sugar free coffee creamer no extra added lkke table sugar just SF creamer and I have 1 cup in the morning the rest of the day is straight water as my POTS I need to hit at least 64oz of water a day. I dont drink juice milk or soda. I do eat fairly healthy as is but I did go back to eating like pasta and breads but km not a huge sweets person and my drink is always water besides that one cup of coffee in the morning. Now with my finger poke machine im always in a good area for fasting levels in the morning and even with eating pasta or something the highest ive caught a ""spike"" is 125. But the other morning I had my cup of coffee sugar free creamer then I made 3 hard boiled eggs for my breakfast-I do this just about every day- and about an hour after I started to feel like crap so I was like hmm wonder what my sugar is.. 58. So im now noticing issues where its going quite low. Im going to be making an appointment with my primary and hopefully she'll have some advice as the other two doctors brushed it off and said im to young for diabetes.. but can anyone give insight on why its dropping so low? Even with my somewhat healthy eating choices? I was assuming it was maybe high but most time I test it its like 80-50 something and the lows are having me concerned!

I love Christmas with my son, I’ll buy him a couple of gifts and fill his stocking. I’ll decorate and do some baking. We’re going to Christmas Eve Mass just the two of us which is something I’m really looking forward too this year.

I’ve tried for years to be happy with consumer Christmas but it just doesn’t sit right with me. I just can’t fake it anymore so I’m throwing up some boundaries.

I hope a nice calming Christmas Eve will help balance out the craziness of Christmas Day at my parents house.

I’ll brace for all the gifts shoved onto my lap, making them feel validated with the “wowww thank you !!”

The guilt I will feel that I didn’t spend more money on more gifts for everyone will eventually rub me the wrong way and I’ll disassociate but Hey ! It’s Christmas! The coffee and alcohol will be flowing.

Hopefully it will be just enough numbing to take the edge off so I try and focus on the moment and not all of this junk. Try not to notice the phone camera shoved in my face, all the pictures being taken for even MORE validation from random people on my stepmothers Facebook.

\*\*\*\*\*\*  
**Synopsis:**  
Following the chilling discovery by Dr. Haruka Takahashi at the KAGRA observatory, the silence of the cosmos has been broken not by a greeting, but by a gunshot. Now, the evidence must be presented to a skeptical world. In the halls of the UN, the fate of humanity will be decided, and a desperate plan will be born. But a plan needs builders. Across the globe, five special scients are about to receive a call that will change their lives—and end their world as they know it.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*

# Chapter 4 The Sentence of an Inevitable Truth

“*A man does what he ought to do, regardless of the personal consequences, regardless of the obstacles, dangers, and*  
*pressures, and that is the basis of human morality.”*  
—Winston Churchill

The influence of Dr. Tanaka and Professor Ishida, combined with the reputation of Haruka’s parents, secured access to the JWST in record time. Two weeks later, after the three of them had verified and double-checked the data, some of the most influential scientific minds on the planet took their seats.

There would be no colorful remarks or pleasantries: only the evidence.

The meeting was tense from the start. Haruka faced them: the same minds who shaped humanity’s understanding of the universe, gathered with unprecedented urgency. Some looked irritated, others merely curious. After the brief, obligatory pleasantries, she began her presentation, making the urgency of the matter unmistakable.

“And here,” Haruka concluded after an hour and a half of presentation, while the JWST images showed the intricate geometric patterns of residual heat around HD 40307 and the infrared and Doppler-shift signature of the projectile on a direct vector to Earth, “you have the only plausible explanation for the energy required to generate that gravitational pulse: a Dyson sphere, or something very much like it.”

No one spoke. Only the soft hum of the projector filled the room.

Haruka set the remote on the table and sat down, suddenly aware of how exhausted she was. She studied the faces before her, one by one: disbelief, fear, denial. She took a sip of water and waited. For the moment, her part was done.

Dr. Aris Thorne, a renowned British astrobiologist, was the first to break the silence. His accent frayed under the strain.

“Dr. Takahashi... what you’re suggesting is... monumental. Are you absolutely certain there is no natural explanation for that geometric infrared signature? Some atypical protoplanetary disk, perhaps?”

Ben Carter, the famous American astroengineer, still processing the implications, leaned forward.

“So, we’re saying we’ve been detected by a Type II or III civilization on the Kardashev \[1\] scale, and their response was... to shoot us?”

“I’m afraid all the evidence points in that direction, however improbable it sounds, Ben-san,” Tanaka replied. He knew Carter from their work together at the Kakuda Space Center, where Carter had served as an external consultant.

Dr. Jian Li, a Canadian physicist and engineer of Chinese descent, continued the assault, sharp and precise.

“Or we’re chasing ghosts,” he said. “A complex artifact. A subtle instrumental bias. Have we absolutely ruled out residual misalignments in JWST’s optics after the maneuver? Unknown subatomic interference? Before we invoke alien megastructures, we must exhaust every known physical and instrumental explanation.”

At that moment, Professor Ishida Matsuoka, an elderly Japanese astronomer whose meticulousness and almost legendary skepticism were as solid as KAGRA’s foundations, spoke up. Decades earlier, he had pioneered the use of neural networks to filter noise from faint astrophysical signals. He was known for his reserve; when he chose to speak, the scientific community listened.

“We have modeled every natural scenario and every plausible failure mode—even the absurd ones, Dr. Thorne, Dr. Li,” he said calmly. “The AIs have run exhaustive diagnostics on both instrumentation and data, in parallel with our own checks. The temperature distribution, the geometry, the absence of significant gas or dust… none of it matches any known disk model. It does, however, align—disturbingly well—with theoretical models of large-scale artificial structures and their unavoidable thermal leakage. And we have the Doppler-based triangulation that led us to the JWST images of the ‘projectile’.”

 

“What about the gravitational pulse?” asked Dr. Lena Petrova, the general relativity specialist. “The energy involved… If your calculations hold, we’re talking about a significant fraction of a K-type star’s total output released in a short burst. For propulsion. That implies accelerating a substantial mass to relativistic speeds.”

   
“Hostile alien life,” Thorne whispered, his face drained of color. “I’ve always supported the idea that other civilizations must exist out there, but to see it confirmed like this…”

Ben Carter ran a hand over his face; his usual confidence had fractured.

“I don’t think you’re grasping the scale,” he said hoarsely. He typed on the console and projected an image of Mars and its moons onto the central screen.

“That’s Phobos—twenty-two kilometers across\[2\] Now picture something of similar size with ten times the mass. To compress something in the order of 10^(17) kilograms into that volume, you need a density that’s… obscene. That object isn’t porous rock. It’s compact metal. As compact as it gets. And it’s moving at seventy percent of the speed of light.”

A deathly silence fell over the room as the image sank into their minds. The idea of taking Mars's largest moon, multiplying its mass by ten, and launching it across the solar system like a bullet at 70% the speed of light turned the problem from a terrifying abstraction into a physical, tangible, and insurmountable reality. It was at that moment that terror truly took hold.

“The evidence leads unequivocally in that direction, Ben-san,” Haruka said firmly. “The data also supports your estimate: a projectile roughly twenty to twenty-five kilometers across, with a mass on the order of 10^(17) kilograms—about ten times the mass of Phobos. The gravitational pulse was the muzzle flash, racing ahead at light speed. The projectile itself follows more slowly, but not by much.”

“Estimated time of arrival?” Lena Petrova asked, her voice faint.

“The launch must have taken place around 1993,” Haruka said, lowering her voice. “The gravitational wave travels at light speed; we detected it forty-two years later. Using the distance to HD 40307, the observed energy, and the arrival-time differences at the three observatories… we have eighteen years. Specifically, 2053.”

   
The room absorbed the sentence.

Eighteen years. Not even two decades. A blink of an eye in cosmic time. A desperately short countdown.

Fear thickened the air, settling over them like the silence.

   
“Eighteen years?” Thorne repeated, incredulous. “Impossible...”

   
“Any chance of defense?” Petrova asked, barely above a whisper.

 Everyone already knew the answer. Haruka shook her head.

   
“Against an object of that mass, traveling at seventy percent of the speed of light, no technology we possess—or could plausibly develop in eighteen years—can stop it or meaningfully deflect it,” she said. “The impact will sterilize the Earth.”

The consensus came quickly and without dissent: the world leaders had to be informed. There was no time to waste. Every person in that room carried significant scientific and political weight; within hours they began pulling the necessary strings to convene an emergency session of the UN Security Council within the week. That same day, Haruka and Drs. Ishida and Tanaka boarded a flight to New York, headquarters of the Security Council.

 

During the flight, Haruka finally slept, crushed by weeks of strain. Her rest was broken by visions of fire, unbearable white light, and a frantic search for something she could not name and could not find.

 

A week later, they stood before a hall of world dignitaries in the UN Security Council chamber. The atmosphere was a charged mix of disbelief and brittle tension. Haruka, flanked by Aris Thorne and Lena Petrova, had just finished her presentation. The faces of presidents, prime ministers, and ambassadors were masks of astonishment, denial, and dawning horror. In scarcely seven days, the world had shifted from scientific wonder to diplomatic panic.

   
“Dr. Takahashi,” began the President of the United States, her voice thick with disbelief as she removed her glasses and pinched the bridge of her nose, “are you telling us, unequivocally, that an alien civilization has fired an interstellar weapon at us and is going to destroy our planet?”

“Yes, Madam President,” Haruka replied calmly. “That is the inescapable conclusion from the data.”

“This is absurd!” the Russian ambassador exploded. “Gravitational waves? Dubious infrared images? It could be anything! Perhaps a plot to divert global resources!”

“Ambassador,” Dr. Petrova cut in, her tone glacial, “the data have been independently verified by the world’s leading physics and astronomy institutes, including those in your own country. The evidence is irrefutable. The conclusions, however terrifying, are logical.”

“But... eighteen years?” asked the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the figure itself seeming unreal. “Good Lord! So little time? Is there nothing we can do? Any planetary defense? Have we consulted the AGI?”

“The AGI network has analyzed the data and confirms both our interpretation and the timeline,” Haruka said. “Eighteen years. 2053. As for defense… the kinetic energy of such an object is orders of magnitude beyond anything we can generate or withstand. Attempting to intercept it would be like trying to stop a tsunami with an umbrella. The only viable strategy is not defense, but…”

“What, Doctor?” pressed the German Chancellor, leaning toward the microphone, brows knitted.

“Post-impact survival,” Haruka said.

A beat of stunned silence.

“The extinction of complex life on Earth is, under these conditions, a mathematical certainty.”

A low murmur of panic and despair swept through the chamber: muffled exclamations, whispered curses, the scrape of chairs. The brutality of the deadline made everything feel unreal—and far more terrifying.

“We can’t just give up,” the French President protested, rising to his feet. “There must be another option!”

“There isn’t,” Haruka said, with a coldness that surprised even her. “Not for us. Not for Earth as we know it. Accepting this reality—and the urgency of our deadline—is the first necessary step. However, extinction does not have to mean the end of humanity.”

She signaled to her aides, who moved through the room, distributing thick sealed dossiers. For a brief moment she wished with all her being, that she was wrong.

“What you now hold in your hands,” she continued, as the seal stamped on the covers became visible,

**PROJECT ARK — OMEGA LEVEL AUTHORIZATION**

***Ref.: MU-TH-UR/182-Ω***

 

“Is not a plan for salvation. It is a plan for resurrection. A blueprint to encode our knowledge, our biology, and our culture so they can survive the impact and be reborn when the Earth heals.”

She met the eyes of the assembled dignitaries with a resolve she had never felt before.

“We have eighteen years. We must begin today. Eighteen years to build this Ark. Eighteen years for the most monumental task in our history. The work must begin now. There is no room for doubt or delay. The alternative is the absolute extinction of our species.”

The maneki-neko mug still sat on her desk at KAGRA—a small talisman of luck in a world that had just discovered its fortune had run out, and that the time remaining was shorter than anyone had dared imagine. But in Haruka Takahashi’s eyes there was no longer fear, only the iron resolve of someone who stares into the abyss and chooses to build a bridge across it, knowing she will never set foot on the other side.

The distant place had called. And the high bridge had begun to rise, in a desperate race against time.

In the KAGRA control room, the impact timer was set: ***18 years, 0 months, 0 days.***

*“Duty is as heavy as a mountain; death, as light as a feather.”*  
—Samurai proverb (quoted by Yukio Mishima)

**\[Year 2036 — 17 years to impact\]**

 

Project ARK, born from Dr. Haruka Takahashi’s terrifying revelation, was not merely an engineering and scientific endeavor; it was a desperate search for the most capable and, perhaps, most resilient minds Earth could offer. As the project’s global machinery began to move, a discreet network was woven in the shadows to recruit the few who would bear the weight of the future. For them, news of the coming cataclysm would arrive before it reached the rest of the world. And their acceptance or rejection would mark the first link in the chain of survival.

 

**\[Cambridge, United Kingdom\]**

The smell of ozone and cold coffee defined the atmosphere inside the laboratory. The damp Cambridge night clung to the glass windows. The bluish glow of the flow cytometer bathed Dr. Khamala Ahmed’s focused face. She was studying the response of neural stem cells to a new generation of repair nanobots she herself had designed. On the walls of the Cambridge Institute for Regenerative Medicine, projected biochemical pathways formed constellations of light and purpose.

 

At thirty-two, Khamala was a force of nature: rigorous, brilliant, skeptical of anything that could not be proven with data. She had achieved partial reversal of ischemic damage in cultured brain tissue—a milestone. The future of medicine, she thought, was bright.

 

Until the coded message arrived: an urgent appointment with Sir Alistair Finch, the government’s chief scientific advisor. No details. No protocol. The meeting, held in an anonymous room in Whitehall, was brief. Sir Alistair wasted no time on preliminaries: he showed her the JWST data, the gravitational signal detected by KAGRA, the simulations. Khamala reviewed them with impassive attention.

 

“Signal contamination? Optical artifacts? Gravitational lensing? Was the Takahashi Filter calibration verified by independent teams with access to the source code? The residual heat emission spectrum… have you considered models of dense, cold dust clouds with unusual metallicity?”

 

“We’ve exhausted all those avenues, Dr. Ahmed,” Sir Alistair replied, his voice grave. “Independent teams have replicated the findings. The conclusion is what you see.”

 

For several long minutes, she studied the holographic data. Her mind resisted believing it, but the data did not lie.

“A Type II or higher civilization,” she said at last. “A relativistic kinetic projectile. Extinction.”

 

Her acceptance was cold, total, scientific. Survival instinct transformed into equations: cryogenic preservation of germline cell lines, repair of radiation damage and life support in sealed environments for centuries. Humanity, understood as a biological system, had to be saved.

 

When she returned to her laboratory, she switched off the flow cytometer. In the dimness, she understood: her duty was not to save the living, but the species.

 

And duty, she remembered, always outweighed life.

 

While the biology and medicine of the Ark were being born in Cambridge, its digital walls were beginning to take shape in the Urals.

 

**\[Underground Data Bunker, Ural Mountains, Russia\]**

A former GRU \[3\] cryptographer, he lived surrounded by servers and silence. He inhabited a world of encrypted architectures, where digital ghosts waged faceless wars. The contact did not arrive through official channels. It came as a chain of messages, encrypted in an experimental quantum protocol he himself had created. The signature: Lena Petrova.

 

*“Vladimir, I need you. Alpha priority, maximum security. Come to Geneva.”*

 

The meeting took place in a sealed chamber at CERN. Petrova was there, along with Aris Thorne and a young Canadian engineer he knew by reputation: Jian Li. They showed him the same data they had shared with Khamala Ahmed. Vladimir Antonov did not question the physics; he questioned integrity, custody, the possibility of external manipulation, the digital signatures of the observatories.

 

“Everything has been verified,” Petrova said. “The Independent ASI \[4\] Network confirms total consistency of the data.”

 

“The objective of the attack?” he asked calmly.

 

“Preemptive neutralization,” Thorne replied.

 

Antonov nodded.  
“Logical. At that distance, communication is impossible. Uncertainty turns every doubt into a threat.”

 

Then Thorne spoke of the plan: an Ark of knowledge, genomes… and human consciousness encoded into a quantum matrix.

Vladimir’s eyes narrowed.  
“A digital consciousness is as fragile as a dream.”

 

“That’s why we need you,” Jian said. “So the dream doesn’t wake until it is safe to do so.”

 

The cryptographer remained silent, calculating.

Finally, he delivered his verdict:  
“Absolute silence will be the first principle. Redundancy, the second. Eternity, the third.”

   
He accepted. Not out of faith, but because of mathematical perfectionism.

   
If the soul of humanity had to be hidden, he would be the one to write and guard the password.

 

While Antonov sealed the future in code, in Geneva someone was working to give it a body.

**\[Geneva, Switzerland — NeuraNanoTech Quantum Materials Lab\]**

The controlled hum of the magnetic containment fields was music to Irati Salazar’s ears. The Spaniard, born in Bilbao, watched the holographic projection before her: lattices of suspended graphene, each atom a precise note. Her fingers, encased in haptic gloves, guided the matter as if folding space itself.

“And now, if we force the fold here…” she murmured in her distinctly Basque \[5\] accent.

   
“You’ll lose quantum coherence in the adjacent nodes,” a calm voice said behind her.

   
Irati did not startle. Her hands did not waver. She froze the simulation with a gesture and turned slowly, one eyebrow arched in a blend of irritation and inevitable curiosity. Jian Li stood by the entrance, which should have remained sealed.

   
“Jian,” she said. “You always know how to make an entrance. My security system is military-grade. I assume you didn’t come here just to say hello.”

   
“Your security is excellent for twenty-first-century threats,” he replied impassively, stepping closer. “I bring twenty-second-century problems.”

He set a black tablet on the table.

Irati stared at it as if it were a venomous snake. She crossed her arms and leaned back in her chair, a cynical—though not entirely hostile—smile touching her lips.

“The last time you brought me a problem, we redefined solid-state computing,” she said, “and then you vanished for five years without a word. As if, once the problem was solved, you were just bored.”

Jian did not react to the dart. Without asking permission, he activated the tablet. It contained everything: the gravitational signature, the HD 40307 sphere, the trajectory toward Earth. Irati reviewed the data in silence. She let out a dry laugh when she reached certain engineering requirements, then looked back at him.

“Ten thousand years of quantum coherence… you’re writing science fiction.”

“Entropy is the problem, yes,” Jian agreed, as if they were discussing the weather. “That’s why I’m here. I need a material—a substrate capable of maintaining the quantum coherence of a system of a trillion qubits, in deep vacuum, under cosmic-ray bombardment, for lengths of time we have never even considered.”

Irati studied him, her cynicism faltering under the weight of the request. Silence settled over the lab again, this time dense and oppressive. She shut down the simulation, ran a hand through her hair, and let out a dry, humorless laugh.

“Damn it, Jian,” she said. “You always know how to ruin a good day with an interesting problem.”

“You need to build an Ark,” she summarized, “and its hull has to last forever.”

   
“*We* need to, Irati,” he corrected.

   
She held his gaze a moment longer. Then she nodded once, sharply.  
“Fine. But this time, Jian, when we solve it… don’t disappear. Because if the world really is ending, I’m going to want to punch you goodbye.”

   
She turned back to her graphene model, erased it with a gesture, and opened a new virtual whiteboard.  
“All right. Tell me about radiation tolerances. Let’s start with the impossible.”

 

Duty, she thought, was a vector as relentless as entropy.

   
**\[New Delhi, India\]**

Samira Khan watched the projection of a planet collapsing in real time: climate crisis, scarcity, wars over water. At her institution, simulating global collapse was routine. She called it “the science of fear.”

   
The message from Geneva pulled her out of that routine: a meeting with Aris Thorne and a project coordinator. They showed her the same data, the same images. Samira listened without blinking. When she finally spoke, her voice was as calm as a razor’s edge.

   
“An event like this will not unify humanity,” she said. “It will fracture it. People don’t fight to survive the end of the world; they fight for one more day of illusion.”

   
Aris nodded.

   
“That’s why we need you, Dr. Khan. The Ark won't be just a machine; it will be a sleeping society. You will decide how to keep it from destroying itself before it wakes.”

 

Samira understood. The greatest challenge was not technical, but human. Genes and data had to be preserved—but also order, purpose, hope.

   
Her duty would be to safeguard humanity’s sanity.

   
**\[Garching, Germany\]**

Dr. Alex Fuller, dubbed by the press “the new Einstein,” was scrawling equations across a chalk-covered blackboard. Around him, young doctoral students watched, enthralled. His mind was a supernova of ideas. He was known for his brilliant intellect, his willingness to challenge established paradigms, and an energy that was contagious—if sometimes exasperating to his more conservative colleagues.

 

The magic of the moment was broken by the entrance of Lena Petrova, carrying a briefcase that held the weight of the end of the world.

 

They argued for more than an hour: dark energy, deviations from general relativity, unknown astrophysical objects. Fuller rejected the news, counterattacking with a dozen natural explanations; Petrova demolished them one by one.

 

When silence finally fell, his mind yielded.  
“It’s not natural,” he whispered. “It’s intentional.”

 

Lena nodded. Alex sank into his chair, his hands white with chalk. The joy of intellectual discussion had drained from his face, replaced by a cold astonishment. Goosebumps crawled up his arms. The elegant equations and theories that had always been his way of uncovering the beauty woven into the cosmos had become the language of an existential threat. The Fermi paradox had a solution—and it was terrifying.

 

Astonishment slowly turned into lucidity.

 

“If this is real,” Alex said, his mind already working on the theoretical challenges, “then the physics we need is not only about defense. It’s about survival on a scale we can barely conceive. A quantum matrix for consciousness… we’d need to understand large-scale entanglement, coherence in complex systems, and how that interacts with the higher dimensions the ASIs propose.”

“Lena, we need Jian Li on the team!” he added suddenly, urgency cutting through his words.

Lena gave a wry smile.  
“I’m way ahead of you, Alex.”

   
He nodded. It was only logical that Jian had been recruited; his presence alone increased their odds exponentially. Despite the fear, Alex felt the old vertigo of discovery. It was an intellectual challenge he could not refuse.

Duty, he thought, was still to seek the truth—even when the truth wanted to annihilate them.

   
Five minds. Five paths.  
The Ark had found all its guardians.

In a doomed world, duty weighed like a mountain.

And as Earth’s clock ran out of its last grains of sand, those condemned to live began to build the future.

**Author's Note:**

Thank you for reading!

For those curious about the science: **HD 40307** is a real star system located about 42 light-years away in the constellation of Pictor. It actually hosts several Super-Earths (one of them, HD 40307 g, is in the habitable zone). I thought it was the perfect neighbor to send us a ""gift"" at relativistic speeds.

The next chapter will focus on how humanity begins to organize the impossible. See you soon!
