1hrjjh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/1hrjjh9/looking_to_create_local_art_group/,Looking to create local art group!,"Howdy! I (25F) just moved up here from Kentucky and am looking for other people who would like to get together at a local coffee shop to paint/draw/craft and just vibe overall maybe once every week or two. I looked around on Facebook, Meetup etc and was suprised to not find anything like that so I figured I would just create my own! I mostly work from home so it's been hard finding social connections and I would love to invite anybody who is interested to join the Discord I just made so that we can start planning some coffee shop hangouts. I'll put the Discord link below, thanks y'all!

1hrjg50,https://www.reddit.com/r/mikesonofpeter/comments/1hrjg50/after_happily_ever_after_part_4/,After Happily Ever After Part 4,"Osvald and I stepped back onto the ship, the renegade nobleman taking the helm once more.  It was impossible to tell that he was the same man as the one in the cell who had completely given up on everything.  He was confident, driven, and sporting a wicked smile.

“Sorry it took so long,” Dan said.  “I didn’t know how long to wait and couldn’t figure out how to fly the ship at first.  Also, I fell asleep.”

“It’s fine,” said Osvald.  “Though admittedly you are cutting it close.”  Although it was early morning, the sky was dark—the eclipse had just begun.  

“Not much time,” I said.  “What’s the game plan now?”

“No time for anything elegant,” Osvald said.  “We do this the old-fashioned way—storm in and take Emma.  The guards will be aware of our escape but hopefully we can rush in and grab her before reinforcements can take us down.”

“Now that’s a pirate move!” Dan said.  

“I admit, it’s a bit more violent than I usually would prefer,” Osvald said.  “But I suppose one must sometimes do unsightly things in the name of love.”

“Yeah,” I said, smiling at Osvald’s words for reasons he wouldn’t understand.  “You gonna tell her the truth?” 

Osvald nodded.  “Indeed.  Whether she reciprocates or not, I know I will regret it if I don’t.  I’m through being a coward.  I’m going to do whatever it takes to save Emma—to save the woman I love!”

“Oh cool, he admitted it,” said Dan.  “Guess the night in prison was productive after all.”

Down below, the castle was active and on high alert.  Blowing up a prison usually made that happen, to be fair.  Osvald steered the ship to a building next to the castle, a large structure with a stained-glass roof.  The ship came to a stop right above the building.

“That’s our destination,” Osvald said.  “This is the cathedral.  Ardnoth will be performing the ritual here.  Once the eclipse reaches its zenith, Emma will be sacrificed.”

“How much time do we have?” I asked. 

“Not long.  The zenith will be in the next few minutes.  According to my research, this eclipse will last maybe ten minutes.  If we are unable to liberate Emma, then the least we can do is prevent the ritual from moving forward until the eclipse ends.  That will force Ardnoth to postpone his plans until the next one.”

I put a hand on Osvald’s shoulder.  “Are you willing to settle for that?”

Osvald let out a maniacal laugh.  “Please, Mike.  A villain like yours truly?  I don’t settle for anything other than perfect.”

“Good.  Best of luck to you.”  As I gave Osvald my best wishes, the skeleton pirates were grabbing weapons and rope, both of which were also handed to Osvald and I.  I looked at the items in my hand and then to Osvald.  “You’re making me come with you, aren’t you?”

“But of course,” Osvald said smugly.  “Like I said before, I need all the help I can get, especially now.  Besides, you defeated *me* in battle.  You can handle these pushover guards.”

“Yeah, Mike,” said Dan.  “Quit being a baby.”

“Easy for you to say!  Are you even coming with?”

Dan scoffed.  “’Course not!  Somebody’s gotta fly the ship!”

“Quite,” said Osvald.  He raised his sword into the air.  “Men, we’re off!  Let’s go save a princess!”  With that, Osvald and several of the undead pirates jumped off the side of the ship and down to the cathedral below.  

I looked down at the insane display of airborne piracy and realized they expected me to follow suit.  “Oh, *hell* no.  I am not—” I didn’t get to finish my thought as one of the skeletons shoved me off the side of the ship.  I managed to grab hold of my rope and hurtled towards the cathedral roof, screaming all way through.  Just before we crashed, Osvald whipped out his wand and fired a blast of pure force at the ceiling, shattering it.  We fell straight through the opening and landed inside the cathedral—gently and safely, inexplicably enough.

The cathedral was occupied by several robed figures and some guards.  The king was near an altar in the back along with a high priest looking type and Emma.  It seems not a single one of them was ready for Osvald and his group to just drop from the ceiling and they all just stood in shock for a moment.

I doubled checked my person to make sure I hadn’t died during the fall.  “How the hell did we survive that?”

“Enchanted rope,” Osvald said.  “Let’s us safely land no matter how high up we are.  What, did you really think a sky pirate wouldn’t take precautions against falling to his death?”  Osvald turned toward the king and pointed his wand at him with a dramatic flourish.  “We meet again, old man.”

The king was foaming at the mouth.  He moved to stand between us and Emma.  “It seems my mercy was misplaced,” he snarled.  “I won’t make that mistake again.  Guards, kill every last one of them!  Do not let them interrupt the ceremony!”

The guards rushed us but Osvald was undeterred.  “I don’t think so!”  He thrust his wand forward and fired another wave of force that sent the charging soldiers flying backwards.  The king went to make a move but Osvald trained his wand on him, forcing him to stand down.  Meanwhile, the skeletons kept the guards busy while I helped—and by helped, I mean wildly swinging my sword in the general direction of any bad guy who came remotely close to me.  Again, I never claimed to be a fighter.  

“You’ll pay for this, boy,” the king growled.

“Silence,” Osvald calmly commanded.  “I’m not here to talk to you.”  He turned his attention towards Emma.

“What are you doing here, Osvald?” the princess asked.  “Please, just leave us alone!  I don’t want to hear your lies anymore!”

“Then listen to my truth!” cried Osvald.  His voice was shaky and panicked.  He stood there silently, avoiding looking Emma in the eye.  I thought he might back down again but he found his resolve and faced Emma directly.  “When my parents died, the world resented me, it rejected me.  I told myself that I didn’t need anyone else.  That I could succeed on my own.”  Osvald laughed bitterly.  “What a pathetic lie that was!  I just didn't want to face the truth—that I was lonely.  That no one wanted me.  I thought my solitude was my strength but in truth it was my weakness.  Al I ever wanted was to reach out to someone, anyone, and for them to take my hand.”  Osvald’s knees had been shaking since he started talking but at that moment, the shakes vanished, the quiver in his voice faded.  “And then I gave you that handkerchief.  I reached out.  You accepted.  And then everything changed.  I told you villains don’t love, Emma.  And that too was a lie.”

Emma covered her mouth with her hands.  “Then, do you mean…?”

“Yes,” Osvald said softly.  “Emma, I…” Osvald took a big breath and spoke confidently.  “I’m in love with you!  I want to be with you!  I want to save you!  Please, believe me, your father lies to you!  About your siblings, about the war, the curse!  He does not care about you.  But I do!”

“Osvald…” Emma whispered with tears in her eyes.

The king just barked out a mocking laugh.  “Pathetic!  Do you really think this makes up for your crimes?  Need I remind you that you have kidnapped her time and time again!  Emmalinde will never love you!  Not after all that you’ve done!”

“I don’t care about that!” said Osvald.  “Even if she never loves me, even if she hates me, I will do everything for her!  All I have to my name is my ship but I will give Emma everything her heart desires.  A lovely mansion, beautiful clothes, delicious food, anything she wants!  I’ll make sure she lives like a queen!   And I…” Osvald grew quiet again.  “I'll be whatever she wants.  I'll be her king, her servant, even her jester.  Just as long as I can give her the life she deserves.  But right now…” Determination filled Osvald’s eyes as he flourished his sword in the other hand and pointed it at the king.  “I think I'll be her knight.” 

Emma’s eyes were full of stars and her cheeks were crimson.  Osvald’s confession had let her speechless.  Her father, on the other hand, had plenty to say.  “You speak of Emmalinde as if you truly know her but the only time you have spent with her are moments stolen from those more deserving.  I am her father!  I raised her, fed her, clothed her, taught her everything she knows!  I have been there for every milestone, every important moment from infancy to adulthood!  You can’t hope to match that!”

“I don’t care about any of that!” Osvald replied.

The king shook his head.  “That is because you are ignorant.”

Osvald was quiet at this.  But eventually he responded.  “…then tell me this—what is Emma’s favorite flower?”

Ardnoth doubled back.  “What?”

“If you know her so well then you should know what her favorite kind of flower is.”

Ardnoth sighed.  “This is ridiculous.  I think I’ve entertained you long enou—” A burst of pure magical force soared through the air straight to Ardnoth’s chest.  A circle of glowing green runes appeared between the king and the attack and the magical volley slammed into the circle.  The force of the impact knocked the king back a step but otherwise he was totally fine.  Ardnoth flashed another smug grin as he reached under his shirt to pull out a medallion glowing the same green color as the runes.

“White.  Lilies,” said Osvald.  “Her favorite flowers are white lilies.  A field of them look like a starry sky.”

“Nice try, hedge mage,” said the king.  “But I’m prepared for your tricks.”

Emma gasped.  “Father, what is that?  Is that magic?!?”

“Only a precaution, my dear,” said Ardnoth.  “A charm to defend against the occult.  I detest using magic like so but it is a last resort.”

I clumsily battered back a guard’s spear with my sword and shouted back “Feels like you have a lot of last resort magic, huh?!?”

The king ignored me, his sights set on Osvald.  “Your magic is strong, but this charm absorbs any and all spells cast at me.  It is hopeless to—” Osvald refused to let the king finish, firing another spell at him.  The amulet once again blocked the attack but it still staggered Ardnoth backwards.  

Osvald refused to give the king a moment to breath.  He hammered Ardnoth with spell after spell, stepping closer and closer to his target with each wave of the wand.  The attacks weren’t damaging him but they did keep the king stunned in place.  Osvald continued speaking, each statement punctuated with another blast from his wand.  “Her favorite animal is the songbird because of the beautiful music they make.  She loves to watch the sun rise and set, to see how the color of the sky changes.”  Osvald blasted the king over and over, the crystal at the end of his wand glowing more and more violently.  “She loves to dance when she thinks no one is looking but I manage to sneak a peek all the time and even when she notices me, she still dances!  She’s read *The Flameheart Knight and the Frozen Maiden* so much she can recite it word for word!  One day she wishes to write a fairy tale of her own!”

The last spell from Osvald’s wand was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back.  The wand exploded in his hands and Osvald yelled out in pain.  Emma reached out and cried “Osvald!”  The light of the explosion dissipated and Osvald stood there holding the stump of his wand with a bloody hand.  The broken wand fell to the floor and Osvald attempted and failed to move his injured arm.  He dropped the sword in his uninjured hand and shakily reached into his coat to pull out a new wand tipped with a sparkling blue crystal.  “And she loves to sing.  She hums these cute little songs she makes up and sings them to herself, not caring who could hear her.  He voice is beautiful.” 

With the onslaught paused, Ardnoth rushed Osvald with a roar but the pirate noble flicked his wrist and launched a bolt of lightning at the king.  The runes once again blocked the magic but the momentum caused Ardnoth to fall backwards.  Osvald continued his unrelenting attack as the king struggled to stand back up.  “But you would take that from her.  You would take *everything* from her!”  Osvald waved his wand, storing up a massive amount of electricity.  “BUT I WON’T LET YOU TAKE *HER*!”  He fired a humongous bolt of lightning at the king.  “SO LET EMMA GO!”

Right before the bolt made contact, Ardnoth screamed and held out a hand.  The lightning crashed into his open hand and he struggled to hold the spell back.  The king spoke some eldritch words in an ancient tongue and rose a foot in the air.  The lightning in his hand swirled around his body and shifted from blue-white to a blood red.  With another incantation, Ardnoth fired the lightning back at Osvald, sending him flying backwards to the ground.  Osvald laid still, breathing ragged and eyes closed.

“Osvald!” cried Emma.

“No!” I screamed out.  I looked around and saw the skeletons were losing ground to the castle guards.  In an instant, the battle had shifted against us.

The king floated gently to the ground as the magic around him faded.  His own breathing was heavy but none of Osvald’s spells had injured him.  “A fine attempt,” he said.  “But pointless.”

“Father,” said Emma.  “What—what *was* that?  How did you do that?”

“Another trick I picked up,” he said proudly.  “A way to redirect spells thrown at me back at the caster.  Our little count here was hoist by his own petard.”

Ema gasped in horror.  “But…but you used magic!  You told me that magic was vile, used by monsters and those willing to blacken their souls!”

Ardnoth chuckled.  “Ah my dear, you are still young.  One day you will understand.  But for now, we must hurry.  We need to complete the ceremony soon.  Don’t you wish to end the curse?”

“I…” Emma looked down at Osvald who was beginning to stir.  He opened his eyes and stared into Emma’s tear-filled ones.  They held each other’s gaze as Osvald futilely attempted to reach a hand out to her.  After a moment, his arm dropped to the ground, his head soon following.  Emma turned back towards her father, shoulders square and the tears in her eyes replaced with fire.  “No.”

“What?” said Ardnoth.

“I refuse to complete this ceremony.  Not until I have spoken with my siblings.”

Ardnoth’s eyes grew wide.  “Your…your siblings?”

“Yes,” said Emma with a nod.  “You told me that not all of them had been taken by the curse.  Many of them had been married off to other nobles.  I wish to ask them about this ritual.  Surely, they have heard of it, yes?”

The king nervously chuckled.  “E-Emmalinde, dear.  This ritual was just discovered recently!  None of them would have heard of it before!”

“Then I would like to inform them that we have found a way to free them of our shared curse.”

The king looked up at the sky.  I followed his gaze.  I averted my eyes from the eclipse (I wasn’t trying to go blind from this quest) but I could tell the darkness was fading.  The eclipse was nearing its end—and Ardnoth’s time limit was almost up.

“There’s no time!” shouted Ardnoth.  The fear was obvious in his voice.  “The ritual must be completed during the eclipse!  If we do not perform it now then we will lose our chance!”

“That’s fine,” said the princess, undeterred.  “There will be another eclipse next year.  We can perform the ritual then.”

The king reeled back in surprise.  “How can you be certain?!?”

Emma gave a soft smile.  “The royal library contains many books that predict celestial phenomena, from passing comets to eclipses.  I have had much time to read all about them.”  Emma squinted at her father.  “After all, I have spent *many* years trapped inside my room.”

“I-I see,” said the king.  “W-well, we cannot guarantee that the curse won’t take you by then!”

Emma shrugged.  “My elder siblings seem to be doing well.  I feel like we can take the risk.”

Ardnoth grit his teeth.  “Have you let that pirate’s words poison your mind?  I am your father!  Are you saying you don’t believe me?  That I am a liar?  Well?”

“I—” Emma averted her eyes and became silent.

Ardnoth sighed in frustration.  “Emmalinde, my dear, I promise that I will answer all your questions.  But for now, let us hurry and complete the ritual.”

Emma stared down at the floor.  The girl had spent her entire life controlled by her father and I guess a minute of bravery wasn’t quite enough to undo her programming.  “…I understand.”

“Good.  Now, let’s—”

“One last question,” Emma interrupted.

Ardnoth groaned.  “What is it now?!?”

Emma looked up and locked eyes with her father.  “What is the name of our enemy?”

The king blinked.  “The…enemy?”

“Yes,” she said with zero emotion.  “The enemy nation we have been warring with for all this time.  The one’s who cursed our family.  You’ve spoken about them but you have never told me their name.  I wish to know the names of those who have cursed me.”

“A-ah, yes!  Of-of course!  Surely, I had mentioned it already, yes?  You must have forgotten.”

“I did not forget,” she said coldly.  “What is their name?”

The king gulped.  There was a bead of sweat on his brow.  “It…it is…” A flash of inspiration struck Ardnoth’s face.  “Idrilis!  Yes, that was it!  In the excitement and chaos of the attack it slipped my mind until now!  I apologize, princess.  Now, are we ready to begin the ceremony?”

Emma just stared at her father unmoving.  “…the Flameheart Knight.”

“What?”

“Idrilis.  That is the name of the kingdom in *The Flameheart Knight and the Frozen Maiden*.  It is my favorite story.  Osvald just mentioned it.  That is probably why you chose that name just now.”

Ardnoth’s face grew pale.  “Now, Emmalinde, dear—”

Emma just got in the king’s face.  “They’re right, aren’t they?  Osvald and Mike.  You’re lying to me.  About everything.  Aren’t you?”

Ardnoth stammered, trying to come up with another lie to cover for him but nothing came to mind.  After a few moments of panic, his face suddenly became cold and hard.  “I am done being nice today.”  He forcefully grabbed Emma’s arm.  “We are going to complete the ritual.  *Now*.”

Emma struggled to break free from the king’s grasp but failed.  “No, let me go!” she cried as her father began to drag her to the altar.  “Someone, please, help!”

“Shit!” I said.  “Hold on, I’m—” I didn’t get to finish my thought as a blur of movement rushed towards Ardnoth.  The king had time to turn around just in time for a furious Osvald to stab him in the chest with his sword.  The king cried out in pain, spitting blood from his mouth.  He let go of Emma, who backed away and screamed.

“Interesting,” said Osvald through clenched teeth.  “That bauble of yours protects you from magic.  But it seems my sword works just fine!” 

Ardnoth choked out “You vile little—” before Osvald thrust his sword further into the king’s chest and through his back.  He let go of the sword and the king stumbled backwards.  He fell to the ground and stopped moving.

Osvald glared at the king’s body.  “For my mother and father, you *bastard*.”

Emma cried out and rushed into Osvald’s arms—well, arm, seeing as his injured one still wasn’t moving much.  The princess sobbed into the count’s chest, averting her eyes from her father’s body.  Through sobs she asked “Is he…”

“I’m sorry,” Osvald said.  He turned to me and said “We need to go.  Hurry, before—” A pained groan interrupted him.  The three of us looked in horror as King Ardnoth slowly stood back on his feet.  He grabbed the sword in his chest and pulled it out, the wound in his chest immediately sealing.  

“Apologies, Count Rosenveld,” the king said with a wry smile.  “But you’ll have to try harder than that if you want to kill *me*.”  Osvald went to make a move but the king was quicker, casually swinging Osvald’s blade and slicing the count’s chest.  Osvald fell to the ground in pain as the king dropped the sword, grabbed Osvald by the neck, and lifted him into the air.  Osvald struggled to breath and with only one arm to work with, he couldn’t fight out of Ardnoth’s grasp.  

“Father!” Emma cried out.  “Please stop this at—” The king casually backhanded her with his other hand, knocking her to the ground.  Osvald’s furiously clawed at his attacker’s arm but the king did not react.

“No!” yelled King Ardnoth.  “I have been merciful but you shall make no more orders.  I am King Ardnoth Brenione, the ruler of the greatest kingdom in all the realm!  All that I see I conquer, all that I desire I take!  And I will crush anyone who stands in the way of what I want!  Whether it be my daughter—” He tightened his grip on Osvald’s throat.  “—or a treasonous pirate.”

“No!” cried Emma.  “Stop!  Don’t hurt him!”  She grabbed her father and tried to pull him away from Osvald but it was pointless.  The king just laughed, bringing Osvald closer to his face. 

“What’s the matter, count?” Ardnoth mockingly asked.  “You had plenty to say moments ago?  Are you tongue tied?  Can’t *choke* out another speech?  Hm?”  He laughed in Osvald’s face—blissfully unaware that Osvald had seized his amulet.  He ripped it from the king’s neck and hurled it to the other side of the room.  “NO!” the king yelled out.  He dropped Osvald and dashed towards his amulet.  Osvald hit the ground and locked eyes with me before looking to the floor—towards his wand at my feet.  I grabbed the wand and tossed it to Osvald.  He snatched it out of the air and pointed the violently sparking tip at Ardnoth.  The king turned back to Osvald just as a massive lightning bolt fired into his now-unprotected chest.  With a painful cry, Ardnoth was sent sailing through the air, slamming into the wall, and collapsing in a heap.

I rushed to Osvald’s side and Emma and I helped him to his feet.  “Excellent throw,” he said, panting heavily. 

Emma removed her hand from Osvald’s chest and saw it was stained crimson.  “You’re hurt!” she said.

“It is not a serious wound,” he replied.  “But I will need medical attention.  Hurry, we need to go.”  As he said that, the doors of the cathedral blew open as more guards rushed inside.  They charged towards us but they were blown into the air by a magical explosion—Osvald’s ship had fired on them.  I looked up to see Dan leaning over the railing of the ship.

“Hey!” he yelled.  “I figured out how to fire the cannons!  That was fucking *awesome*!”

“Nice one, Dan!” I called out.  I asked Osvald “How are we getting out of here?”

“The ropes,” he said.  “Tug one twice and it will pull you up.  Just be sure to hold on tight.”  He went to grab a rope but stumbled.

“I’ve got you,” Emma said.  She put his arm around her shoulders and they both tugged on a rope.  The skeleton crew members grabbed their own ropes and I did the same.  The ropes returned to the ship and pulled us with them.  In about ten seconds, all of us were back on the deck of the ship.  

“Get us moving!” I yelled to Dan.

“Aye aye!” he said.  He turned the wheel and the ship began flying away from the castle and towards the horizon.  

One of the skeletons relieved Dan of steering the ship while a few more began to tend to their captain’s wounds.  Osvald winced as they dressed his wounds but otherwise, he seemed no worse for wear for somebody who got his hand blown up and struck by lightning.  I leaned on the railing of the ship and let out a big sigh.  “Finally,” I said.  “It’s over.  Thank God.”  Right as I said that, I heard several high-pitched screeching noises.  They were far away but getting louder—and closer.  “Fuck,” I mumbled as I turned to see a hoard of stone gargoyles chasing after us.  On the back of one of them was King Ardnoth himself.  His skin was gaunt and skeletal, his eyes dark and sunken in.  He looked like one of Osvald’s skeletal pirates and he had an insane grin on his face.

“You will not escape me!” he shouted.  “Ur’galon’s debt shall be paid!  I will have what was promised to me!”

The other joined me at the railing, watching the gargoyles gain on us.  “What are those?” asked Emma in horror.

Osvald grunted.  “It seems King Ardnoth has given the castle statuary sentience.  More dark magic from that foul demon lord.”

“This is really ruining the *Gargoyles* cartoon for me,” Dan said.

“He just does not know when to give up, does he?” I asked.

“Then we will teach him,” said Osvald.  He faced the crew.  “Full speed ahead!  Ready the cannons!  Open fire!  Do not let them board!”  The crew got to work as the ship made evasive maneuvers to outpace the king and get the cannons in position to fire.  Osvald took out several more wands from his coat and handed them to everyone.  “Do you know how to use one of these?” he asked me.

“I don’t know,” I said.  “I’ve never really—” I flicked my wrist and a crackling bolt of crimson energy launched out of the tip and straight at one of the gargoyles, shattering it into a thousand pieces.  I admired my handiwork for a moment and said “Yeah, I think I’ve got it.”

Emma stared at the wand in her hand with utter revulsion, shoving it back at Osvald.  “I can’t use this, it’s magic!”

Osvald gave her an understanding look and said “I understand your reservations but if those things board the ship, you will die!”  Osvald gently grabbed her hand.  “Please, princess.”  Emma hesitated for a moment before accepting the wand.

The four of us got to work blasting the gargoyles.  Our aim wasn’t the greatest—Dan and I didn’t really have much experience using wands and Emma had even less.  Osvald was still recuperating from his injuries and using his off hand to fire.  It was a miracle he was even standing, let alone still fighting.  Despite the handicap, the sheer amount of targets meant we pretty much managed to land most of our shots.  Osvald tried to shoot the king out of the sky but he was in the middle of the pack so he had plenty of cover.  Cannon fire shredded through the gargoyles but it was hard to get a good shot on them with cannons while also running away from them.  Our combined efforts were keeping them back but the stonework army was getting closer and closer.

One gargoyle managed to slip by and land on the deck, knocking us back with the beat of its stone wings.  It went to strike at Osvald but Emma blasted it to smithereens with her wand.  She was covered in dust and panting in fear but there was a glimmer of pride in her eyes.

“Nice one!” I said as we returned to blasting our pursuers.  We were slowly whittling them down but there were just too many of them.  The gargoyles would be on us in seconds and Emma would be within their grasp.

“It’s not looking good!” Dan cried.

“Just hold on!” shouted Osvald.  “We just need to hold on and—” He was interrupted by a screech of something much bigger than the gargoyles.  A massive black shape shot past the ship and towards the gargoyles, shattering a dozen of them and sending others crashing to the ground.  The creature unfurled its wings and let out a challenging roar as the gigantic vulture that Dan and I had allied with at the start of this adventure came to the rescue.

“Vulture friend!” said Dan.  “You’re back!  Kick their asses!”  The vulture let out a cry that was probably an affirmative one as it got to work thinning out the herd.  The vulture was a whirlwind of beak, talons, and wings, diving in and out of the mass of stone monsters.  In seconds, the army had thinned to about a dozen or so that the four of us on deck had a much easier time of handling.  

Ardnoth screamed in frustration.  His gargoyle mount slipped past the vulture and charged straight at us.  The vulture turned to pursue it and managed to chomp the gargoyle mount in half.  Ardnoth leapt off the gargoyle and slammed into the railing of the ship.  He pulled himself over the railing and began trying to climb aboard. 

Osvald raised his wand at the king.  “I won’t let you—aargh!” Another gargoyle had slipped past the vulture and tackled Osvald.  Two more followed shortly, gunning for Dan and I.  The three of us were forced to deal with our attackers—leaving Emma alone to face her father.

“Emmalinde,” the king said.  “Please, come with me.  Don’t let them deceive you!  I’m your father, I love you!  Everything I’ve ever done has been to keep you safe!”

I whiffed a shot at my gargoyle.  “He’s lying!” I landed the second shot and clipped its wing causing it to slam down on the deck.  The skeletons all jumped on it to finish it off for me.  I tired to rush to Emma’s side but Dan’s gargoyle had knocked him back into me, sending us both tumbling onto the deck of the ship.

The king continued his spiel.  “I know this is all so confusing to you but I promise I will explain everything to you!  Just pull me up!  Quickly, I’m starting to slip!”

Emma froze.  Her resolve wavered at her father’s pleas.  She made a move to reach towards the king then suddenly stopped.  “What is my favorite flower?” she asked.

“What?” asked Ardnoth.  “I’m holding on for dear life and you’re asking me about *flowers*?!?”

“If you truly love me, you would know.  Osvald just said the answer a few minutes ago.  What is my favorite flower?”

The king panicked as he tried to recall the answer.  “Um, yes, I know this, it’s, um…yes, that’s it!  It was tulips!  Your favorite flowers are tulips!”

Emma just closed her eyes and sighed.  “I truly wished you had answered correctly.”  She raised her wand at the king and the tip began to glow.  “Goodbye, father.”  A scarlet blast domed the king in the forehead and sent him tumbling into the sky.  He screamed as he plummeted until his voice was too distant to hear.  The gargoyles that had boarded the ship quickly flew off to try and save their master while the remaining stragglers were either shot down by Osvald or destroyed by the vulture.  Soon, our pursuers were gone and the ship made a speedy getaway from the castle, finally giving us a moment to breathe.  

Emma fell to her knees are started crying.  I awkwardly put a hand on her shoulder to try and comfort her.  

“You were right, Mike,” Emma said as her tears stopped.  “Everything my father said was a lie.  You were only trying to help.  I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be,” I said.  “I get why you didn’t believe us.  I didn’t believe it at first either.  Plus, I didn’t exactly do myself any favors by leading you on like I did.  Sorry about that.”

Emma wiped her tears on her sleeve.  “All is forgiven,” Emma said.  She was quiet for a moment.  “I wanted to believe it was all still a lie.  But my father—my father is…” She began to cry again.  “My father is a monster!”  She buried her head in my chest and I just sat there and let her cry it out.  After a few minutes, she composed herself and dried her eyes with her handkerchief.  She stopped midway and just stared at the handkerchief before turning her attention towards Osvald.  The skeletons had finished dressing Osvald’s wounds and he was standing upright, albeit a little wobbly.  Emma stood up and the two gazed into each other’s eyes.

“Are you alright?” Osvald asked.

“You are the one who was injured,” she replied.  “I should be the one asking that question.”

Osvald tried to look tough and shake it off.  “Such is the life of piracy.  You get used to this sort of thing.”  The count averted his eyes from Emma and softly said “I’m glad you’re safe, princess.”

Emma walked over to the railing of the ship and looked down.  With her back to us, she asked “My father, do you think he…”

Dan, Osvald, and I looked at each other for a second.  “Survived?” Osvald asked.  “Yes, I believe he did.  His pact with the demon lord makes any conventional method of killing him impossible.  We stopped the ritual that would extend this pact but I do not believe he will immediately die from it.  I feel certain that his time is running out, however.”

“I see...,” said Emma.  She was silent for a moment.  “I suppose this makes me a fugitive of Brenione like yourself then.”

Osvald looked down sheepishly.  “Yes.  As long as your father still lives, he will not rest until he has you in his clutches again.  You won’t be able to return home.  I am sorry.”

“…then I suppose this means I am your prisoner once more?”

Osvald jerked back in shock.  “What?!?  No!  Princess, I—” He stopped as Emma giggled and turned around to show she was smiling softly.

“Oh, to be your captive once again,” Emma said teasingly.  She put her hand to her forehead in a dramatic gesture and walked over to Osvald.  “Kidnapped by the dashing yet nefarious Count Osvald von Rosenveld.  Does your wickedness know no bounds?”

“Princess, what are you talking—” Osvald finally seemed to understand what Emma was doing and he just laughed to himself.  He brushed the hair out of his face and put on his most wicked grin.  “’Tis only fitting for a scion of evil like myself.”

Dan leaned over to me and whispered.  “The hell?  Are they—are they *roleplaying*?”  I simply shrugged silently while Emma and Osvald continued their scene.

“Then I shall be trapped here?” Emma asked.  “On this heinous vessel of yours?”

“Indeed,” replied Osvald.  “I am merciful, however.  I shall give you free reign of my aircraft.  Explore to your heart’s content.”

“Oh?” she said with a raised eyebrow.  “Confidant I won’t try to escape?”

“Confidant you won’t be able to,” he replied.  “After all, we both remember what happened last time.”

 “It wasn’t that bad!”

“That bad?  If I hadn’t come along and saved you, you would have been eaten by a carnivorous bramblehide!”

Emma laughed.  “I suppose you’re right.”  She put her hands to Osvald’s chest.  The count stopped breathing the moment her hands touched him.  “It seems you’ve always been saving me, haven’t you?”

“Ha!  D—don’t go around saying things like that!  People might start to think I’m not the villain I say I am!”

“Of course.  Apologies.”  Emma gazed into Osvald’s eyes, her face a bit more serious now.  “My father will not stop util he has rescued me from your clutches.  You will have to never let me out of your sight, to keep me at your side at all times.”  She stroked the side of his face.  “Do you think you can do that?”

Osvald’s villainous façade cracked at her touch.  “I…” He regained his composure and wrapped a shaky hand around her waist.  “Yes.  I promise you, as long as I draw breath, I will never let you leave my side.”

“I see,” whispered Emma.  Her eyes were half-closed and her lips were slightly parted.  The two were inches apart from one another.  “I suppose…such a fate would not be too terrible after all…” The two closed the distance and kissed each other passionately.  The skeletal crew started applauding and Dan and I joined in.  The two broke the kiss, faces red and laughing with embarrassment, and gazed into each other’s eyes.

“I love you, Emma,” said Osvald. 

“And I love you, Osvald,” said Emma.  The two kissed again and held each other in a tight embrace.

Dan and I just enjoyed the heartwarming moment before he asked “So, is this relationship okay?”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Like, is this a kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of thing?”

“Oh,” I said, having never really thought about it that way.  “Um…no,” I said not so confidently.  I followed it with a much more confidant “No, I think it’s fine.  Yeah!  They, like, definitely were in love with each other before the whole kidnapping thing.”

“Yeah!” Dan said.  “Plus, he was saving her the whole time!”

“Yes!” I said.  “Exactly.”  As Dan and I cleared our doubts, the morning sky shone once more as the eclipse ended and the happy couple sailed into the horizon towards a brand-new life of freedom and love.

***

Osvald dropped Dan and I home not long after we escaped from the king and promised us that he would stay in touch.  A few weeks later, he kept that promise by calling us via a magic crystal ball.  I had been gifted one on one of my many adventures years ago and had pretty much forgotten about it until now.  I sat down on the couch and placed the crystal ball on the coffee table.  The crystal ball showed Osvald and Emma in the cabin of the ship, still holding on to one another.

“So, things have been going good then?” I asked.

“Yes,” said Emma.  “Relatively, anyways.  Father survived the fall, as expected.  He’s branded me a traitor to the crown and put out a bounty on me.  But I’ve heard rumor that many Bren’s are divided on this.  It seems I was beloved by the people of Brenione and now they are beginning to question my father.”

“That’s great!” I said.

“Indeed,” said Osvald.  “In fact, Emma and I have discussed trying to rally the people to our side.  No one believed me due to my reputation as a scion of evil but with Emma by my side I think we can get them to see the truth.”

“Wonderful,” I said.  “And I take it your dad is still trying to capture you for the demon pact?”

“Yes,” Emma said.  “But I do not believe we will need to worry about that.”

“Really?  Why?”

The couple averted their gaze from mine and both their faces turned red.  “W-well,” Osvald stammered.  “You see, a few days ago I discovered that, um, one of the stipulations for being sacrificed was that the child still be…well, a, um, ‘maiden.’  And, well, by that point Emma and I had already—uh, that is to say, we’ve—”

I held up a hand to them.  “It’s fine, I think I figured it out.  Well, anyways, congrats on everything, Emma.  Er, I guess I should call you Emmalinde?  Since you said Emma is reserved for the man you love?”

Emma shook her head.  “No, Emma is fine.  For years, I associated the name Emma with a villain.  But now—” She looked down at the floor sadly.  “Emmalinde is the name I associate with unpleasant memories.”  She smiled and gazed lovingly into Osvald’s eyes.  “I am no longer Princess Emmalinde Brenione.  I am simply just Emma.  And I would have it no other way.”

I smiled.  “Well, in that case, I hope the rebellion is a success, Emma.”

“As do I.”  Emma smiled at me.  “All my life, I thought the world was as simple as the stories I read.  But now I see just how wrong I was.  I wish to make my kingdom a better place.  I wish to give Brenione their happily ever after.  I know it won’t be easy.  And what comes after will be hard.  But I believe it can be done.  And once it is—” She gazed at Osvald.  “I can finally see what comes after happily ever after.”  Osvald squeezed her hand and kissed her tenderly.

“Good,” I said.  “Well, I’ll let you go.  Be safe out there.”  We said our goodbyes and I hung up.  I leaned back in my chair and exhaled.  “Glad that those kids got together.  Good for them.”

Dan came out of his room.  “Speaking of love lives, I just got off the phone with Liz and explained to her that the whole ‘princess fiancée’ was just a big misunderstanding.  So, it looks like you still have a shot with her, lady-killer.”

“Seriously?” I asked.  “How’d you swing that?”

Dan just shrugged.  “What can I say?  I have a gift.”

“Well, thanks.  Glad that’s resolved.”

“Well, I’m just glad we don’t have a princess living in our apartment anymore.”

“Heh, true.”  As I enjoyed this adventure finally being over, there was a knock on the door.  I got up to answer it and saw my brother-in-law, Prince Percival.

“Percy?” I said.  “What are you doing here?”

“Ah, Mike, perfect,” he said.  Percy had a suitcase with him and looked a bit sheepish.  “Well, your sister and I had a little fight and I need somewhere to stay for a bit.  Do you have a room I could use?”

I stood in the doorway in silence.  I looked back at Dan, who simply put a finger to his nose and said “Not it.”",1,1735785212.0,mikesonofpeter,1,1.0,False

I then remember telling myself that it was a thought and to go back to sleep. I then woke up and was ok for a bit, then started to really overthink.

When selecting any type of coffe, but lets say espresso lungo (today), I selected a double shot (x2) and literally NOTHING was dispensed. It all went into the tray instead of out the spout and into the cup. I descaled it, cleaned the brew group, followed everything to a T but then tried to do the espresso lungo (x2) again, and same exact situation... Grinds the coffee, runs theough dispensing it... Into the tray, then completes. Then i tried another selection from the screen, americano, and same aituation, though towards the end i did get a tiny little bit that made its way into the cup. Ao i went back to the espresso lungo and again, same thing... 

Any ideas what could be causing any and all water to go to the tray instead of out the spout as it should. 

Please help. This dang machine has been a problem since day one but love how it looks but should definitly work better than it does for a $1500 price tag.

He let me plan our wedding until the day we broke up. I am still heartbroken.,"My (F33) ex-fiancé (M29) broke off our relationship in July. He let me plan our wedding until the day we broke up. I am still heartbroken.
 


Back story - my ex fiancé was friends with my brother for 11 years, since he (ex) was 18 and friends with sister in law (my brothers wife) for 7 years give or take. They were in a band together and spent a lot of time together as a band and with their group of friends 

Ex and I started dating March 2022 and I moved in with him about a year later, he proposed December 2023. He was my best friend and I trusted him more than any person in my life. It just seemed so natural and comforting. I know we were in love and he cared about me a lot. We never fought or raised our voices at each other…

We got in an argument on the way home from our Fourth of July trip, which took up pretty much the whole day because we stopped to look at 2 wedding venues on the way home. That night when we got home we had an argument, he went for a walk and when he came back I told him I’m here to talk when he’s ready, and laid in bed. He didnt talk to me and I woke up crying at 5 am.. he asked if I wanted to talk or be comforted and I said I wanted to talk. I asked him if he thought we got engaged too soon and he said yes, then I asked him how we can move forward and work on things and he said “I don’t think we can” and that was that. He was extremely adamant about not making it work and going our separate ways. I tried and tried to get him to change his mind but he was sure about not wanting to be with me. Mind you, we talked the whole weekend with his parents about the wedding plans, looked at venues on the way home and even discussed our bridal party the weekend before at a coffee shop we used to go to saying we wanted to bring our wedding party there to tell them.  We also took engagement pictures 3 weeks before breaking up.. i had NO idea that he was feeling this way. He later (after breaking up) expressed that he felt like he couldn’t come to me about issues because I can be “defensive” and he didn’t feel I was a “safe space for him” I never knew he felt like that. He brought up other things like I was on my phone too much (I was planning our wedding) and our sex life wasn’t as much as he wanted, he said we were incompatible and wanted a relationship like his brother & sister in law (I still don’t know what he meant by that) because in my eyes we were best friends. He also said we didn’t communicate well.. We were so happy and (I thought) respectful of each other but he basically blamed me for everything.. I really just had no idea he felt this  way, he said he had built up resentment and regret because of all of it. 

My brother and sister in law don’t speak to him anymore and he doesn’t hang out with their friend group and band mates anymore either. They all lost so much respect for him and he essentially isolated himself away from his friends too. These are friends we would see frequently and some friends he knew since high school. 

Come to find out about 4 months after we broke up, he started dating his coworker. I had a suspicion of this coworker (F25) even though I trust my ex at the time. He actually introduced me to her and she has come to his band’s shows twice throughout the year. He also spent work trips with her, & went to one of her parties while I was out of town.. But again I met her and have had conversations with her, and didn’t think much of it. But their friendship started to make me feel uncomfortable and I expressed that to him. I told him I didn’t like him hanging out with her and he said his other coworkers were there everytime and “you don’t trust me?” I said I did trust him but it makes me uncomfortable and I’m setting a boundary. They’re both musicians and are on their company’s social media/creative team.. they post reels/videos on many different platforms playing music together and interviewing other musicians, etc. I think he had harbored feelings for her and saw things in her that he essentially liked better. I still can’t even think about dating or being in a serious relationship with someone new. 4 months after an engagement he’s dating his coworker!! 

My sister in law said this is a pattern of his to be a serial dater and has even left an ex for someone new in the past. He has always been in a relationship and I think 4 months of us not being together might be the longest he’s ever been without a girlfriend. I thought I could trust him because he was so close with my family and friends. I really thought I would spend my life with him. 

Writing this all out makes me realize that it’s a him problem and although I have things I need to work on, this is just who he is as a person. The beginning of the relationship was so sweet and intimate, he said I love you first (after 10 days of dating 🚩) but at the time I thought it was sweet, I told him I didn’t feel the same way but I still cared for him a lot and I know I will eventually feel the same. 

I just feel so terrible about myself and feel like I could have done things differently to avoid us breaking up. It hurts so much still. I am slowly feeling better but it affected me a lot and I don’t see myself being in a serious relationship for a long time. I am beside myself that he has the capacity to be in a new relationship.

1hrj4pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hrj4pj/what_beginner_set_up_do_you_recommend_1000_cad/,What beginner set up do you recommend [$1000 CAD],"I apologize in advance if I use the wrong terminology here, I’m a complete coffee beginner. 

My work gives me a $1000 wellness spending account and after going my whole life not liking coffee, I realized last year that I actually enjoy coffee and want to spend that money on an espresso set up. I’m a complete beginner at coffee and only drink milk drinks unless it’s a light roast drip coffee (again sorry if I’m using the wrong terminology here). I don’t think I’ll be drinking my espresso shots by themselves any time soon. 

So what would you recommend? I’ve been doing some research in this subreddit and on YouTube and I’m leaning towards a Breville Bambino + which retails for $500 on Amazon or $649.99 on the Breville website (another question would be if it’s better to order off of Amazon since it’s so much cheaper?) and then the rest of the money would go towards a grinder and accessories. I’ve also seen some good things about the Ninja Luxe though and the automation does interest me as a beginner, especially considering the low price point of the machine for what it can do.

I don’t know enough about coffee to be able to really differentiate how espresso shots taste and I currently get my latte fix from Tim Hortons (which if you don’t know is probably at the bottom tier as far as coffee goes). So I’m open to anything that is easy to use, completely within my budget, and will allow me to make milk drinks. Thank you so much in advance!",2,1735784235.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1hrj3xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hrj3xj/frustrated_with_work_and_expecting_to_get/,Frustrated with work and expecting to get reprimanded,"So, I’m an assistant manager at a coffee shop and our manager is currently out of town from the 31st-7th. My last day at my current location is the 4th before I transfer to a new location that we are opening.

For context today we had someone call out sick but I was on a requested and approved leave for New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. (However I was put in a position where I had to work New Year’s Eve last night)
So, I messaged our groups to find a cover but couldn’t find anyone. Apparently we were slammed all morning and I tried to contact the crew on to see how they were doing but no one was answering until about noon when a new crew would take over for the mid shift. I then was able to find two people to come in and help for the mid shift crew. 

At 4pm I get a call from a shift lead who tells me everyone’s pissed at me for not coming in to help today because I was expected to be there. Now, knowing my company they’re going to tell me I was not a team player for coming in today but at the same time I had a leave request submitted months ago for me to have this ONE holiday off. I also feel that the manager should not have taken these specific dates off after I requested it off first and he’s missing my last week at our location so I feel like I just got stranded during a busy time. 
But, I am preparing for the conversation with our upper boss where he tells me I should’ve been there to help after potential crew complaints and I’d like to know how I should handle it because ultimately I want to tell him in a respectful way that I am not compensated enough to be coming in during my requested time off and I do feel that if I have approved time off that it simply should be time off, no questions asked. If I was out of town I don’t know how they’d expect me to be there still. 

(moving locations in less than a week to be with a different manager is what I am looking forward to because it won’t be like this type of chaotic and unorganized however I will still have the same upper boss but am hoping some communication will work this out for us) 

In summary: how do I tell my boss respectfully that I’m not compensated enough for this shit and deserve my days off properly? ",1,1735784165.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Then in fantastic beasts she used it on the whole bank basically then at the end they used it on Jacob but at the start of the second it didn't take because it was claimed that ""it only works on bad memories"". That was also understood from the English and American pov.

I posted this itinerary before we left and almost everyone said to not do so much and leave a good chunk out. I’m so glad we didn’t listen to the advice and did what we wanted to do! I encourage people to do the same when planning. 

Day 1: Landed around 7PM, went to check in to our hotel in Ueno district and then got Ichiran and 7-11. Loved Ichiran! And our first of many Japanese 7-11 experiences was great! 

Day 2: First time navigating the JR rail at the stations, much easier than I thought it would be, especially with Google maps. Went to Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, and Asakusa. We did our first Donki shop and it was definitely overstimulating. Standouts from this day were taking the JR rail, Senso-ji temple at night, Kirby Cafe, Shibuya Crossing, walking around Shinjuku, Sunshine City, and the Christmas market at Skytree. 

Day 3: Disney Sea! The scale and detail of this place was amazing and so much better in person, the YouTube videos do not do this place justice. There was a lot of people in the morning, I think we got there at 7 and made it in for 8:30. Unfortunately did not get in to the Frozen ride but we did dine in the main hall of the castle. Loved the Tangled ride, Journey to the center of the universe, the food was great, and Fantasy Springs was very beautiful. 

Day 4: Explored Ueno park for a bit which was very beautiful and calm in the morning. Had some nice lattes in a local shop (Coffee Muraski), checked out of the hotel, went to Akhibara which I really loved as a gamer and someone who grew up with video games, then we took our first Shinkansen to Nagoya. The shinkansen was amazing, we saw our first glimpse of Fuji. Checked in to our Nagoya hotel, went to an Izakaya and had great food then went to do our first onsen at our hotel which really elevated our trip especially with all the walking we were doing. Onsens are so rejuvenating. 

Day 5: Had a great big Japanese buffet breakfast at our hotel and went to Ghibli Park, I really loved the Grand Warehouse and seeing Kiki’s restaurant but I didn’t know as much as my girlfriend, she loved Howls Moving Castle, the park itself is very nice to walk around in, I loved the garden area and the gift shops had great things to buy. We then made our way up to Takayama and checked in to our Japanese style hotel, and this was a highlight! The rooftop private onsen at the hotel was glorious and the free ramen at night was a nice touch. 

Day 6: We had another big Japanese breakfast buffet, I got to try Hida beef which was so tender and delicious. We went to the morning market and got really cute cat and dog drinks in a cookie cup, saw koi fish in the canal, walked around the old village and went to see a pagoda and Takayama Jinya (the old edo period government house).  We made our way to Shirakawa-go, and it was very beautiful around there, not much to do expect walk around and visit some of the houses but glad we went. Made our way down to Kyoto and checked in to our hotel afterward.

Day 7: Went to Hiroshima to visit the Peace Memorial Museum and Park, harrowing and gut wrenching. Especially being in the area where it all went down. The A bomb site was surreal and even just seeing the canals. I had my first okonomiyaki which was unfortunately a microwaved version, still enjoyed it. We took the ferry to Miyajima afterwards and it was so beautiful, the landscape, the deer, the shrine and temple on the water, the birds, we loved everything about the island and had my first oysters here, amazing food. We will be back! Made our way back to Kyoto. 

Day 8: Went to Kiyomizu Dera, the parks, temples, shrines, pagoda and village along the way are beautiful. We had a private tea ceremony in kimonos which made our experience very special. The giant bhudda, Ryozen Kannon is incredible, so glad we stumbled upon this. Went to Fushimi Inari, I was very impressed with the scale of this shrine, very beautiful! We then went to do some shopping (Pokémon Center, Nintendo Kyoto, Kiddy Land) and had dinner at a conveyor belt sushi place - delicious, but I got food poisoning :( 

Day 9: Went to Nara park, the deer are very funny and there are so many of them! It was kind of sad to see the tourists take advantage of them and mess with them, we saw one guy feed a deer his styrofoam tray for an example… Saw Todaiji Temple, amazing! After, we went to Dotonbori which was hell for me as I was still sick from the sushi last night. I really did not like this place and may have been because I was sick but wow it was dirty, loud, hectic, and had hoards of people. We saw Osaka castle which was massive, the moat around it was so impressive. We went to Pokémon Cafe which was fun and back to Kyoto.

Day 10: Went to Arashiyama monkey park, bamboo grove, and Otagi-nenbutsu - all were very beautiful. The song during the feeding for the monkeys was sort of unnecessary to me. The monkeys were so cute and funny. Bamboo grove is quite beautiful, the bamboo are so thick it’s crazy. Otaji-nenbutsu is very unique and the bhudda statues are so nice. After, tried to make it to Hoshun-in to see the bonsai but it seems it was closed that day :( Sad for me. After, Starbucks Ninenzka Yasaka Chaya, and a night stroll. 

Day 11: went to Kawaguchiko Lake and stayed at a traditional ryokan, very beautiful evening. Fuji was clear and the sunset along the lake was beautiful. We had a very enjoyable and calm night at the ryokan with an onsen and hot springs from Fujiyama.

Day 12: went to stay at a bit of an upgraded ryokan, again, relaxing, beautiful, and loved the onsen! We also saw Chureito Pagoda which was very beautiful on a sunny day! Although this onsen was just regular water. 

Day 13: Went back to Tokyo, stayed in Shinagawa as our flight was at night. The next day. We tried getting tattoos but it was quite difficult, we were in Harajuku and it was so busy, all the animal cafes sucked to see! I had a solo adventure to Tokyo station, went to Ginza, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. Did some shopping, saw a shit load of people on a busy Saturday night, tried to get Ichiran but they all had hour to two hour waiting times so I settled for premium ramen at 7-11 with some sides. Fun night!

Day 14: Went back to Harajuku to try and get tattoos from a different place, couldn’t find the place. Checked some cool stores out, did some last minute shopping. Went to the airport, and chilled before our flight! 

Left out some things but wanted to generalize it! 

Overall Japan is an amazing, tourist-friendly, clean country full of culture, amazing landscapes, tons to do, and friendly, courteous people. 

The JR rail was so impressive and easy to use. I hate the animal cafes! Loved the konbinis and shopping here. Visiting Pokémon Centers was so fun. The amount of malls and how big they were was insane! I loved how people minded their business, coming from a Western society, it was a nice change of pace. Everything was so convenient! Takayama, Miyajima, Kawaguchiko Lake were highlights, of course Tokyo too. 

Thanks for your warm hospitality and being so open to welcome tourists in your beautiful country.

1hrj2hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hrj2hg/opening_a_coffee_shop_in_my_old_neighborhood/,Opening a coffee shop in my old neighborhood,"Hey everyone,

I’m excited to share something I’ve been dreaming about for a while. My brother and I are planning to open a small coffee shop in the vibrant and beautiful suburb where we grew up, here in Athens, Greece. We have both spent more than a decade abroad, working and living in the USA and Ireland. 

We have found a spot and we are close to sign the lease. It’s just 200m from the center of the neighbourhood, and our focus will be on creating a cozy spot for local residents to grab great coffee, relax, and connect.

This area holds a special place in my heart—it’s where I spent my childhood, and now I want to give something back to the community. My vision is to keep it simple and welcoming: quality coffee and bagels.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

What do you look for in a neighborhood coffee shop?

Is there anything that I should consider before moving forward?

Would you support a new local spot like this?
