First, there has to be some type of big violation with a closed bathroom when the store servers food. Pretty sure they have to have a restroom for the customers to use. See we have a lot of homeless addicts that they want to blame for making the bathroom$50,000 for someone overdosing in the bathroom?

Well they hate homeless Americans mainly and discriminate in so many ways I d like to find a way to take big action considering the homeless and locals keep their business going when season is over. Pretty much $1 a day/ 356yr. What store can u say u consecutively spend money with like that? And the are rude and need to be taught how to treat people in this country,!

1kmbfik,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1kmbfik/i_explored_county_clare_by_car/,I explored County Clare by car,"Hi everyone,

I recently did a road trip through County Clare and thought I’d share the route I followed, in case anyone is planning something similar. It was a 2-day loop in a rental car, starting and ending in Galway, and it turned out to be one of my favourite parts of Ireland so far.

Day 1 – From Galway to Doolin - I left Galway in the morning and drove down through Kinvara, then entered The Burren. I didn’t expect it to feel so surreal – the landscape is rocky, quiet, and almost otherworldly. I stopped at Caherconnell Fort, and saw a sheepdog demo by chance – very touristy, but honestly quite fun.

From there I continued to Poulnabrone Dolmen, and then took one of the smaller roads toward Doolin, where I stayed the night. Doolin is tiny but has live music in the pubs, and it’s right by the sea.

Day 2 – Cliffs of Moher and the coastal drive back - I started early and drove up to the Cliffs of Moher just before the tour buses started arriving. I walked a bit of the trail and got some of the classic views. After that, I took the coastal road back through Lahinch (beach town, nice for a coffee stop), then continued to Ennistymon and made my way back up toward Galway.

It was a full two days, but never felt rushed. The roads are narrow in places, but nothing too stressful if you take it slow.

While preparing the trip I was looking for more personal recommendations (not just TripAdvisor lists), and I found a blog called *Explore Irish Life*. The guide for Clare had a map with all the stops already marked, plus timing suggestions, and I ended up using it as a base to plan my route.

So, I've been having this recurring thought that's kinda weird but also strangely comforting. What if our future, run by robots and AI, actually ends up saving the planet instead of destroying it? I mean, hear me out... We're all worried about AI taking over our jobs, maybe even our lives, but what if they actually become the heroes we didn't know we needed?

Imagine, like, robots tending to fields, planting trees, and cleaning the oceans all day long without getting tired. And maybe they'd manage resources way better than us 'cause, let's be honest, we're not exactly winning at that game right now. Could they become these eco-friendly caretakers, making sure flora and fauna thrive while keeping the human race in check? It's a bit scary, but kinda hopeful, too. 

I know it's a big what-if, and maybe I'm just dreaming... but aren't all great changes driven by a crazy idea at first? Maybe these mechanical caretakers could give us the breathing room to learn how to do better by our planet. Who knows? Just a thought I've been tossing around while sipping my morning coffee and gazing out the window.

# ❤️Introduction❤️

  
A moral agent conscious of a big injustice happening in a society has a moral obligation to act effectively to eliminate this injustice as quickly as possible. To be able to fulfill this duty of acting effectively, the moral agent must learn the sociological mechanisms that allow the elimination of an injustice in a society. In other words, the moral obligation to eliminate an injustice includes a procedural obligation to learn the mechanisms that allow the societal elimination of injustices.  


It is the sociology of the social construction of public problems or the sociology of social problems that studies the process by which certain issues are identified as public problems and become the object of political action. According to sociologists, problems that become identified by society and the authorities as public problems become so not because of their objective importance, but because of some dynamics that take place in the societal debate (Becker, 1966)\[1\].

# 🧡I.                Three dynamics by which a problem metamorphoses into a public problem 🧡

 

❤️a.     Collective mobilization ❤️  



The first dynamic of the process transforming an issue into a public problem is *collective mobilization*, also called “popular participation” by some sociologists (Cobb, 1983)\[2\]. In this stage, some people who consider that an issue is a problem, start to publicly make a political claim stating that the problem has to be eliminated by the State or by a company that is blamed for the problem. Very logically, to see one day the elimination of a problem, some must beforehand claim publicly and clearly that this problem has to be eliminated. Lawyers have to put precise claims in their legal actions if they want the judge to give them what they request for their client, in the same way social actors must make a precise claim to get what they want (Felstiner, 1980, p. 636)\[3\]. This claim-making can be made in link with demonstrations, violent actions, peaceful symbolic actions, petitions, letters to the editor, boycotts, strikes, etc. Mobilization aims to make the claim more visible to the public, attract attention and sympathy from the public opinion or the media, to defend publicly the claim by disseminating the arguments in favor of the claim in the public and finally to increase the number of citizens who share the political opinion of the claim to be able to make sufficient pressure to see a change (Hassenteufel, 2010, p. 51)\[4\].

 


🧡b.     Mediatization 🧡

The second dynamic is *mediatization*. Nowadays, without media coverage it is unlikely that an important issue will ever become a public problem and will be resolved by the authorities (Dispensa, 2003, p.90)\[5\]. This is easily understood by the fact that a claim and the arguments in favor of it are much more visible to the public if they receive media coverage. Since mediatization can quickly increase the number of citizens sharing the political opinion favorable to the claim, it is extremely important in the process of social change. Therefore, moral agents seeking to eliminate an injustice should carefully study the factors that help to increase media coverage surrounding an issue.

   



# 💛c.     Politicization 💛

The last dynamic is *politicization*. It refers to the stage where some authority or political person puts finally the issue on the political agenda with the objective of producing a decision that will eliminate the problem (Hassenteufel, 2010, p. 53)\[6\]. According to Kingdon (1984), a problem must first be on the governmental agenda to be put on the political agenda and produce a political decision for its elimination. What Kingdon (1984) calls the “governmental agenda” is what integrates all the subjects to which people in and around government are paying serious attention (Kingdon, 1984, p. 143)\[7\]. These objects are often the ones that are regularly covered by the media.  


In a more graphic way, Kingdon (1984) explains that to generate a political decision three streams are at play.  


The first stream is the *problem stream*. An issue must be picked from the available *problem stream* where swim all the problems to which the government pays attention. Three main mechanisms capture the attention of public authorities so that it appears in the “problem stream”:  


\-        indicators (i.e. polls or statistical measures which are often mediatized),  



\-        policy milestones (i.e. crisis which are often covered by the media),  



\-        feedback effects (i.e. information, in the context of an evaluation in particular, about policy failures which are also mediatized).  



The second stream is the *policy stream*. It corresponds to the available policy solutions that can be easily adopted. These solutions must meet the criteria of technical feasibility, their compatibility with prevailing values and their capacity to anticipate future constraints.  


Finally, the *political stream*, which integrates the public opinion of the moment, the actual organized political forces (political parties in particular), the executive branch (sometimes its recent change) and the possibilities of political collective bargaining, gives sometimes rise to a political opportunity for an authority or a politician to take action. Only the joining of these three streams can generate a political decision centered on the elimination of the problem (Kingdon, 1984, p. 178).

 

# 💛II.              How social movements can influence these dynamics to increase their chances of success 💛



# ❤️a.     Collective mobilization ❤️



# ❤️i.                 Expressing the claim ❤️

As stated above, the collective mobilization dynamic is the one where social actors make publicly a political claim. We have seen that a problem has very little chance to be eliminated if nobody claims for its elimination. Applied to the problem of killing animals for simple food habits, this means that to see one day this practice eliminated there must first be people who express the political claim that this practice has to be forbidden.

 

# 🧡ii.                Choosing the strategical arguments for the claim 🧡

During collective mobilization, not only a claim is made but are also disseminated in the public the arguments supporting it. To be efficient in attracting the sympathy of as many citizens as possible as well as of the media, social movements have to choose carefully the arguments they use to defend the claim. Chateauraynaud (2011)\[8\] explains that to be effective, the arguments must be directly related to commonly shared principles in the society. Commonly shared principles play the role of a cognitive filter: only those claims that enter in this filter can be easily accepted by the public.  Citizens must be able to link the claim to a general known principle, so that the demand sounds like the continuation of something already existent. A good argument for a claim is the one that produces the insertion of the other's point of view into a known structure. In other words, to be understood by the public as easily as possible and to create as many citizens as possible sharing the political opinion favorable to the claim, an argument has to take its origin in commonly shared moral principles. If we apply these principles, the claim “killing animals for simple food habits has to be banned”, could be defended by an argument like the following: Our society's principles of nonviolence and protection of the weak demand that we end the barbaric practices of slaughterhouses, where countless innocent animals are killed daily despite viable, humane plant-based alternatives. By aligning our social practices with our principles, we can transform slaughterhouses from symbols of injustice into relics of a less enlightened past. That is why the act of killing animals for simple food habits must be penalized.”  


# 💛iii.              Choosing the mode of the collective mobilization 💛

To be effective, social movements have to choose the mode of collective mobilization that has the biggest chances to make the authorities to accept their claims. It is therefore a moral obligation for them to know what researchers say on this subject.

In a study, after analyzing hundreds of violent and non-violent resistance campaigns, Chenoweth (2011) showed that non-violent campaigns succeed in 53% of cases while campaigns that use violence succeed in only 26% of cases, for campaigns that use terrorism the success rate is only 9%\[9\]. The researchers working on this issue, instead of determining what is objectively violence or terrorism, base their analysis only on what is *perceived* as “violent” or “terrorist”.  


Abrahms (2006) states that no matter what are the real policy demands of the movements using terrorism, their mode of action generates the belief that their objectives are maximalist and dissuades the authorities to make any concessions\[10\].

Regarding the perception of the first Palestinian intifada, Kaufman (1991)\[11\] found that while only 15% of the demonstrations during the Intifada were violent (the majority of the latter consisted only of throwing rocks on Israeli Defense forces of the territories), 80% of Israelis perceived that the means used by the protests were “mainly violent” and 93% believed that the Intifada was “directed both towards civilians than towards the army”. More interestingly, while the first objective of the Intifada was “to communicate to Israelis the need to end the occupation of the territories”, Kaufman (1991) found that 66% of Israelis thought that the intifada was directed “against the existence of the state of Israel”.  



This is just one example highlighting the results found by Chenoweth (2011) and showing that the more a movement is perceived to be violent the more it creates the impression that the movement has extremist goals that shouldn’t be adopted by society.  



In another study (Feinberg, 2020)\[12\] where were compared the consequences of different kinds of actions  on the perception of two different groups regarding the same cause and coming from the same movement, it is shown that movement actions that are perceived as ""extreme"" or ""immoral"" by the public generate less public support for the movement. In this study, Feinberg (2020), explains this by saying that when a movement uses “extreme protest actions”, this creates a perception of the immorality of the protest actions which generates decreased emotional connection and identification with the actors of the movement, which in turn creates less movement support. What is interesting is that one of the cases tested on subjects was an animal rights protest. Approximately 300 participants were recruited to test the case. They were separated in three different groups. Each of the groups learned that they would read a transcript from a news broadcast and answer questions about it afterward:  



“participants read about a fictional animal rights activist organization called Free the Vulnerable (FTV). The extremity of the movement’s protest behavior was manipulated at three levels: Moderate Protest, Extreme Protest, or Highly Extreme Protest conditions. The protesters in the two extreme protest conditions engaged in unlawful activities (e.g., breaking into an animal testing facility) modeled after protest activities of real-life social movement activists, with the protesters in the Highly Extreme Protest condition engaging in particularly disruptive and harmful behaviors (e.g., drugging a security guard \[as well as freeing animals kept in the lab and destroying property\]) compared to the protesters in the Extreme Protest condition (e.g., sneaking past the security guard \[and freeing animals from the lab without destroying any property\]). By contrast, in the Moderate Protest condition the activists marched peacefully expressing their demands. Including two extreme protest conditions allowed us to explore competing possibilities regarding the extreme protests’ effects on observers’ support for a movement. On the one hand, observers may base their level of support directly on how extreme the protest actions are, and therefore protest extremity would have a linear impact on bystanders’ support. On the other hand, there might be a threshold of extremity beyond which bystanders’ impressions do not get more negative.” (Feinberg, 2020, p. 1101).\[13\]  



After reading what they thought was a transcript from a news broadcast, participants indicated how extreme they thought the protest was, how much they socially identified with members of the movement, how much they supported the protesters, how willing they were to join the movement and how much they supported the movements’ overarching cause.  



The results showed first that participants in both the Extreme Protest and the Highly Extreme Protest conditions viewed the protesters’ behavior as more extreme than did participants in the Moderate Protest condition. Additionally, participants in the Highly Extreme Protest condition viewed the protesters’ behavior as being more extreme than participants in the Extreme Protest condition. Participants in the the Moderate Protest condition, supported the protesters more, were more likely to join the movement, and were more supportive of the movements overarching cause. But despite the fact that participants in the Highly Extreme Protest condition viewed the protesters’ behavior as being more extreme than participants in the Extreme Protest condition, researchers found non-significant differences between the other answers of the Extreme and Highly Extreme Protest conditions. In accordance with the threshold hypothesis, the researchers concluded:  



“Thus, while protesters in the Extreme Protest condition were viewed as significantly less extreme than those in the Highly Extreme Protest condition, they were judged in a similar light. This result is in line with research arguing that the perceived inappropriateness of many acts does not occur linearly, but as a step function, where behaviors that cross a given threshold are categorized in a similarly negative manner (Alexander, 2008).” (Feinberg, 2020, p. 1101).  



Since the conditions of Extreme Protect Action were only in the illegal entry in the building and the illegal saving of the animals without any vandalizing or damage to property and that the answers of the participants in this condition weren’t much better than in the condition of Highly Extreme Protect Action where the drugging of a security guard and damage to property were involved, it means that the simple fact that animal activists do something illegal (without causing any direct damage to someone’s physical integrity or property) can be sufficient to produce the same negative results as if the activists did drug a human being and damaged private property. According to the results of this study, we may think that the Animal Liberation Front’s opposition to all forms of bodily integrity violations (but its acceptance of damage to property, which is already worse than the Extreme Protest Action Condition in the Feinberg study) may not mean any reduction in the negative consequences of their actions in the eyes of the public. Moreover, despite their ethical principles, animal activists engaging in destructive direct action are still labeled as terrorists (Posłuszna, 2020, p. 3)\[14\].  



As one of the aims of collective mobilization is to persuade the biggest number possible of citizens to adopt the political opinions favorable to their claims, social movements have to choose strategically their mode of collective mobilization.  



Like it has been noted before, campaigns perceived as violent by the public have two times less chances to succeed than those perceived as non-violent, while those perceived as using terrorism have 6 times less chances to succeed.  



But the perception of the actions is produced by media framing which we will examine now.

 

# 🧡b.     Mediatization 🧡

We have seen above that an issue has very little chances to be put on the political agenda if it doesn’t receive media coverage. The mediatization is therefore a very important dynamic helping to transform a problem into a public problem. We will examine precisely this topic, especially regarding the concept of *framing*, before explaining what social movements can do to increase their chances of success regarding this important dynamic.  


It is been a long time that researchers working on the media say similar things about the media:  



They are constantly presenting objects suggesting what individuals in the mass should think about, know about, have feelings about. (Lang, 1966, p. 468)\[15\]  



Mccombs (1972, p. 184) suggested also an agenda-setting function of the mass media\[16\]. This function manifests notably through the selection of issues considered as worthy of interest by the media and through the framing of these issues.

 

❤️i.                 Choosing angles of newsworthiness ❤️  



Research on *news values*, *newsworthiness* and *gatekeeping* done by journalists is useful to understand some of the factors that the media uses to decide whether a subject is newsworthy or not.

Sociologists have made lists of criteria stating that to receive media coverage an issue must satisfy at least with one or more of them. One list of Harcup & O’Neill (2017) includes the following:

“Exclusivity: Stories generated by, or available first to, the news organization as a result of interviews, letters, investigations, surveys, polls, and so on.  



Bad news: Stories with particularly negative overtones such as death, injury, defeat and loss (of a job, for example).  



Conflict: Stories concerning conflict such as controversies, arguments, splits, strikes, fights, insurrections and warfare.  



Surprise: Stories that have an element of surprise, contrast and/or the unusual about them.  



Audio-visuals: Stories that have arresting photographs, video, audio and/or which can be illustrated with infographics.  



Shareability: Stories that are thought likely to generate sharing and comments via Facebook, Twitter and other forms of social media.  



Entertainment: Soft stories concerning sex, showbusiness, sport, lighter human interest, animals, or offering opportunities for humorous treatment, witty headlines or lists.  



Drama: Stories concerning an unfolding drama such as escapes, accidents, searches, sieges, rescues, battles or court cases.  



Follow-up: Stories about subjects already in the news.  



The power elite: Stories concerning powerful individuals, organizations, institutions or corporations.  



Relevance: Stories about groups or nations perceived to be influential with, or culturally or historically familiar to, the audience.  



Magnitude: Stories perceived as sufficiently significant in the large numbers of people involved or in potential impact, or involving a degree of extreme behavior or extreme occurrence.  



Celebrity: Stories concerning people who are already famous.  



Good news: Stories with particularly positive overtones such as recoveries, breakthroughs, cures, wins and celebrations.  



News organization’s agenda: Stories that set or fit the news organization’s own agenda, whether ideological, commercial or as part of a specific campaign.” (Harcup & O’Neill, 2017)\[17\]  



According to this, if social actors want to increase the news coverage of an issue, social movements can present it through one or more of these angles to journalists.

 

💛ii.                Creating contacts with the gatekeepers 💛  



Regarding *gatekeeping,* Clayman (1992) says the following:

“Gatekeeping, as a social scientific concept, can be traced to Lewin's (1947) writings on social planning. He observed that the most efficient way to bring about widespread social change is to concentrate on persons in key positions of influence, who function as ""gatekeepers"" in the flow of goods and ideas through the society.”\[18\]  



Therefore, another excellent way to increase media coverage is to create contacts with some journalists who detain the power of deciding if an issue will become news. It is possible for example for the representatives of an NGO to ask to meet once a journalist around a cup of coffee to talk about their work and future events that can interest the newspaper “in order to see if it would be possible in the future to provide their newspaper with exclusive information regarding the planned activities”. During the meeting it is possible to ask the journalists about advices regarding what are the criteria that help a subject / event related to their cause to be seen as newsworthy. The simple fact of meeting this journalist will create a personal contact that may help to get more media coverage in the future.

 

*💚iii.*               Moving from stigmatization to celebration*💚*

A study showed that vegans were a decade ago often stigmatized by the media coverage in the United Kingdom (Cole & Morgan, 2011)\[19\]. Similar results were obtained regarding media coverage of vegan in Australia (Masterman-Smith, Ragusa, & Crampton, 2014).\[20\] However, in the recent years vegans’ image in the British press has been transformed from a stigmatised lifestyle to a normalized and healthy diet in particular through the mediatization of vegan celebrities (Lundahl, 2020).\[21\] This is surely good news and gives the idea that something similar can be done regarding the image of “animal activists”. The animal rights movement could invite celebrities advocating for the animals to animal rights events to do for example discourses or to be the first signatories of petitions that can be mediatized. Such an association with celebrities in the media has the potential to transform the libel of “animal activist” into something much more positive.

 

🩵iv.               Avoiding negative framings and creating positive ones 🩵


Regarding the *framing* done by the media, Entman (1993, p. 52) says the following:  


To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\[22\]  



Because of the framing process, if a demonstration is presented by the media as a confrontation between police and demonstrators, “the protesters’ critique may not be part of the story – not because there wasn’t room for it, but because it was not defined as relevant” (Reese, 2001, p. 8).\[23\]



# 💙v.                Taking into account the depth of frames 💙

Frames not only shape the presentation of an individual story but can have lasting consequences on our ways to perceive some issues:  



more “cultural” frames don’t stop with organizing one story, but invite us to marshal a cultural understanding and keep on doing so beyond the immediate information. These are the “strategic” frames that speak to a broader way to account for social reality (Reese, 2001, p. 12).\[24\]  



Some sociologists distinguish frames according to their “depth”: *deep* frames are more general and often older and *shallow* frames are specific and often more recent (Wolfsfeld, G., 1997).\[25\] The frame “Cold War” is for example deeper than “unprovoked attack” (Reese, 2001, p. 12) and the frame “animal rights extremism” is deeper than “sabotage of a slaughterhouse”. Some elements of an issue can remind the public of an old and deep frame and produce in their mind the insertion of the issue in this old frame. We can make the hypothesis that the threshold in the study of Feinberg (2020) seen above related to extreme protest actions, after the crossing of which, the consequences of some modes of collective mobilization are similarly negative is linked to the frame “animal rights extremism” that was sustained by the media and that is now known and used by many citizens to categorize animal rights actions as soon as they involve illegality.


# 💜vi.              Avoiding two negative frames 💜

If social movements want to be effective, they must avoid the possibility for the media and the public to insert their actions in a frame that has negative consequences for their cause.


To avoid the frame of “animal rights extremism”, this may imply the necessity of highlighting in a press release that the organized action was / will be totally peaceful and was / will be organized by a serious NGO some of the interesting works of which can be presented in the end of the press release. Ensuring that the visual aspects of an event (important element for media coverage) like banners and signs help to avoid a negative framing can also be useful.


Another framing is also usually used by the media regarding people who oppose the violence inflicted upon animals. When there is media coverage about veganism or vegans, it is generally framed it as a “lifestyle” issue. Because of this framing, the issue of the elimination of the killing animals for simple food habits is therefore constructed not as a question of justice that needs to be addressed by the society and the authorities, but as a simple question of personal choice. This makes the political aspect of the problem totally invisible and ensures that any media appearance of vegans is absolutely innocuous for the problem that animal activists want to eliminate. Given that even activists are influenced by the media, it is not always easy even for them to think outside the usual media frames portraying animal people either as militant extremists or as inoffensive vegans just sharing recipes. To avoid the frame “animal rights extremism” that has negative consequences as well as the frame “lifestyle” that has also very bad consequences since it transforms an important question of justice into a benign question of personal choice, animal activists have not only to make sure that they are seen as peaceful but also have to make their political claim visible for example when they talk to the journalist or with visual aspects like for example inscriptions on clothing like “our society has to respect the lives of the animals”. To make it impossible for the media to ignore the political claims of an event, it is possible to put the claim or part of it directly in the name of the event like “kindness to end speciesism festival” or “march for the closure of slaughterhouses”. Also, highlighting in a press release that a demonstration isn’t composed of vegans but of all people who have the political claim that our society should one day respect the lives of all animals, and explaining in it that the event isn’t about the consumption practice of consumers but about the political opinions of citizens may help to make the political claim of the movement become more visible in the media. Indeed, it is easier for people to share the political opinion of someone to whom they can identify, and it is easier for nonvegans to share the political opinion of end of killing animals for simple food habits if they can identify with other nonvegans who have this political opinion.
  



# ❤️vii. Implementing two new positive frames ❤️

Media often frames animal agriculture as an *economic and social issue*, rather than as a major *ethical and environmental issue*. Animal activists have to act to change that by expressing clearly that it is a major ethical issue and highlighting in their communications that we have to take into account the fact that the quasi unanimity of moral philosophers, our society’s specialists of ethics, who have worked on our relation to other animals consider that the practice of killing animals for simple food habits is wrong and should be eliminated (to highlight this fact, animal activists can use in their communications the “Montreal declaration on animal exploitation” signed by around 550 academics)\[26\].

Animal activists also have to express that animal agriculture is a major environmental issue by informing that according to scientific studies, like the one from Eisen & Brown (2022), the gradual cessation of animal agriculture, over a period of 15 years from today, would lead to the neutralization of global warming over the period 2030-2060, which means in other words, that it would totally offset the warming effect of all other human greenhouse gas emissions over this period\[27\]. The social actors can be successful in changing the framing surrounding animal agriculture, since there are nowadays more newspaper articles that are critical towards meat consumption (Mroz, 2022)\[28\].

# 💛c.     Politicization 💛

Choosing strategical arguments for a claim so that the public opinion is more likely to support it and paying attention to the framing of the problem so that the subject is mediatized favorably in newspapers, are not ends in themselves but help the problem to be put on the governmental agenda (which is the agenda that integrates the problems to which the media pays attention).

What helps the issue to be put on the governmental agenda is also the concrete availability of solutions to eliminate the problem. To be effective a claim should be already expressing what kind of solutions have to be put in place. And ideally focusing on the solution that is the easiest to be put in place by the politicians regarding public pressure and political forces. For example if animal activists want the end of the killing of animals be concretized in law, they should claim not for a legal right to live for the animals but for the creation of a criminal offense that makes it subjected to a fine to kill animals for simple food habits. Since at the end, all problems are eliminated in the law, activists have to request the help of lawyers who are sympathetic to their cause to know how to frame their claim so that it focuses on the easiest legal change to be made to see their problem eliminated. It should be also a good idea to ask parliamentarians sympathetic to their cause which is be the best moment to bring up their issue in the parliament with a petition or another political initiative. If they want to ask parliamentarians to defend their cause in the parliament, they should check which are the actual political forces after an election and ask to politicians who are the more likely to gather the support of the majority. After a new election, it can be a good idea to make their issue heard in the parliament, so that the new elected politicians see that their cause is discussed in the parliament. Activists have to know that a political or legal decision that doesn’t eliminate their problem can be an opportunity to mediatize the issue again and to make circulate in the society the arguments in favor of their claim and sometimes showing that the institution didn’t act in a required way to address their problem correctly. This new mediatization of the issue, made easier by the existence of a new institutional decision to which the media generally pays attention, will help to increase the support to their cause in the public opinion which is very good to change the cultural norm in favor of their cause and which will help us in the future initiatives. All social movements had to make the same requests several times, to have their problems eliminated. After each discussion, their arguments are more shared and understood which already changes the culture and makes more citizens in favor of their political claim.

I've had this massive project that I kept pushing off. I'd tell myself, ""Next week I'll start,"" but then somehow, procrastination swoops in and hijacks the whole plan. It's like my fear of not doing it perfectly just paralyzes me. 🤷‍♀️

Finally, I decided to just go for it. I sat down with a big mug of coffee (my trusty sidekick), and, to my surprise, once I got past those first few hesitant steps, it wasn't as awful as I'd imagined. Sure, it wasn't perfect—there were mistakes and kinda messy progress, but hey, it's progress! I've definitely realized that my fear of imperfection was way more daunting in my head than it is in reality.

This little revelation's got me thinking about how I handle other challenges. Like, maybe my love for planning everything to death isn't always helpful? 🧐 Might be time to embrace imperfection a bit more and celebrate even the smallest wins.

I'm single and estranged from my family for good reason, and over the past few years, I've been through:

- A Section 21 eviction while trying to buy my first home
- Moving into the flat I bought only to discover it was uninhabitable and was making me extremely unwell, leading to a 1.5-year battle to get the original developer to fix it
- Redundancy
- Months of cancer investigations


When I was really sick due to the uninhabitable living conditions, I struggled to keep up with commitments. I cancelled a coffee plan with a friend over 24 hours in advance, and she essentially stopped talking to me over it. She was aware of what I was going through at the time.

Over the next year, she'd occasionally comment on my social media posts, but when I'd DM her to respond (with things like 'thanks for the support, how are you doing?'), she'd shut the conversation down after one message. After a few attempts to reconnect, I gave up. It's worth mentioning that she was my oldest friend; we grew up like sisters. I was there for every major event in her life - including all her family funerals - and her parents took me in like a daughter when my home life was chaotic.

Last week, after no contact, she invited me to her wedding. I feel completely torn. I don't know if I want to go because the way she cut me out over bailing on a coffee once still stings.

1kmb9i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1kmb9i1/long_covid_experience_symptoms/,Long Covid Experience & Symptoms,"Before reading this, I want to explain that I am missing some information, as there is so much to remember. Doctor tests are also not listed.

Summary

 I contracted an COVID-19 infection in February 2022. My first symptom was a sensation of not being able to take a full breath without yawning. At that time, I was experiencing significant bloating and had hyperventilation attacks and panic attacks without realizing it. I made multiple trips to the hospital and was misdiagnosed with pleurisy. I noticed that my heart rate would spike when I stood up, but the doctors assured me everything was okay. As time went on, I started dealing with various stomach issues. In August 2022, I experienced a severe headache that I believed to be a migraine, although I never had it officially confirmed. Based on my research, the symptoms matched what others described: a severe headache, tunnel vision, missing parts of my vision, sensitivity to light, and severe nausea. However, the most troubling symptom was the feeling of being high, which I thought would subside after the initial experience. Unfortunately, I woke up feeling the same and have felt stuck in a state akin to being high ever since. This sensation tends to worsen with increased sinus pressure or excessive movement. Since then, I've become very sensitive to light. Interestingly, I sometimes feel a bit better, even if briefly, about 20 minutes after having a heavy meal, like a burger, despite knowing it's not the healthiest choice. I believe that most of my nearly 10,000 symptoms began in 2023, but I struggle to pinpoint when each symptom started or ended, given the sheer volume of issues to track. I plan to list each of my symptoms below, doing my best to provide a detailed account of what I'm experiencing. Throughout this ordeal, I've also had consistent brain fog, which I suspect may be linked to poor memory due to anxiety, depression, or long COVID. I can't recall the exact time in 2023, but I remember dealing with frequent blood sugar drops for months without understanding the cause. Although I no longer experience that, I occasionally feel close to having low blood sugar. The symptoms I will list below have been present on and off, or sometimes continuously, since I fell ill. This summary captures the timeline of some of my symptoms as I remember them. 

Symptoms

 \*\*Swollen Fingers\*\* My fingers are swollen and turn red and blotchy. They feel stiff and larger when I bend them, and I can feel the creases where my fingers bend more than usual. This sensation may worsen with movement or small physical activities. \*\*Mucus Drainage\*\* I experience constant mucus production and often have a stuffy nose, requiring me to clear my throat frequently because it never feels clear. Sometimes, when drinking from a cup without a straw, I notice that my saliva pulls from the cup due to mucus present in my throat. \*\*Brain Fog\*\* I have difficulty thinking and problem-solving as quickly as I used to, which I believe may be related to my sinus pressure, though I’m not entirely sure. \*\*Sinus Pressure\*\* There’s a consistent pressure between my eyes and on my eyebrows. I believe this symptom is linked to my vision problems, dissociation, and brain fog. \*\*Sensitivity to Light\*\* When I go outside or drive, everything appears brighter than normal, which irritates me. I prefer wearing sunglasses during the day to reduce discomfort. I often experience afterimages, where outlines of objects linger in my vision. \*\*Floaters\*\* I’ve had multiple floaters in my vision that haven’t gone away. One in particular, which seems very long, has been present for at least two years. \*\*Constipation\*\* I am frequently constipated, regardless of what I eat. When I do manage to go, I usually produce small, shaped stools. \*\*Diarrhea\*\* I experience diarrhea occasionally, potentially triggered by specific foods, such as coffee with a lot of milk or dairy. \*\*Bloating\*\* I have felt bloated for the past three years, often experiencing a ball of pressure under my right rib with every breath. This symptom causes considerable shortness of breath, sometimes prompting me to sit up at night to breathe more comfortably. Often, I need to yawn to take a full, satisfying breath. \*\*Fatigue\*\* I often feel unrested, weak, and tired, regardless of how much sleep I get—90% of the time, I feel this way. \*\*Tinnitus\*\* I experience a constant ringing in my ears. \*\*Heartburn\*\* Almost everything I eat causes heartburn, even drinking water. \*\*Asthma\*\* I believe my asthma is exacerbated by the heartburn. \*\*Dissociation\*\* At times, I feel as though I'm drunk or high, and my balance becomes slightly off. This sensation seems to worsen with sinus pressure, which I think can be influenced by specific foods or excessive movement. \*\*Joint Pain\*\* I often experience joint pain, particularly when I wake up. My joints, including my wrists, ankles, and knees, pop frequently. Bending my knees for just a minute can lead to soreness and discomfort when I try to unbend them. \*\*Sternum Popping\*\* I believe the popping sensation in my sternum is related to inflammation of the lining, as indicated by the results from my endoscopy and colonoscopy. \*\*Tingling in Feet & Hands\*\* I occasionally feel tingling in my hands and feet, similar to the sensation of them ""falling asleep."" This feeling often coincides with my swollen symptoms, and it tends to occur more when I transition between hot and cold temperatures. \*\*Memory Problems\*\* I have issues primarily with short-term memory. \*\*Severe Anxiety\*\* All these symptoms contribute to my anxiety. I notice that when my anxiety worsens, many of my symptoms tend to increase as well. I do not believe that these issues are solely attributed to anxiety; I had considered that possibility and ruled it out some time ago. \*\*Blood Sugar Drops\*\* I experience episodes of low blood sugar, resulting in sweating and shakiness. I never have high blood sugar; I only encounter drops. Eating something sweet helps me feel better almost instantly.",1,1747216488.0,LongCovid,0,1.0,False

Every morning starts the same.

I wake before the sun has the nerve to show its face. The world is still. Cold. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that hums in your ears and makes your thoughts louder than they should ever be. I lie there sometimes, watching the ceiling vanish into darkness, wondering if today will feel any different. It never does.

The loneliness always hits first. Not like a wave, waves are gentle, even in their chaos. This is more like a weight pressing on my chest, reminding me I’m still here, still breathing, still waiting for something that isn’t coming.

I make coffee I don’t even want, just to fill the silence with something. Anything. The sound of the machine, the smell it’s the closest thing to company I have. I sit by the window, cup in hand, staring at nothing. Sometimes I pretend I’m waiting for someone. But no one ever comes.

There’s this ache inside me. Not the sharp kind, but the slow-burning one that makes everything feel heavier. Like I missed something important a long time ago. Like I was supposed to love someone, or be loved, but somehow I never quite found the right time, the right words, the right version of myself. And now it’s too late.

People say time heals everything. But they don’t tell you that time also buries things, dreams, hopes, the parts of yourself that used to believe in things. I think anger lives in that burial ground too. Not rage, not fire, just the quiet resentment of someone who tried, really tried, and still came up empty.

I see others out there, living lives that look full. They laugh in grocery store aisles, complain about traffic, text someone who’ll text back. And I wonder what it feels like to be missed when you’re not around. I wonder what it’s like to be someone’s reason to stay.

But wonder only gets you so far. The sun eventually rises, painting the sky like it always does, indifferent to who’s watching.

And I tell myself, like I always do: Just make it through today.

Even though a part of me knows
I’m not waiting for the sun.
I’m waiting for something that will never be.

1kmb886,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmb886,I have a Problem: Sacrificing too many Beans to Trial-and-Error Recipe finding … Can AI help?,"Hey all,

As I’m browsing reddit, I see I’m not the only one loving to test and explore new/different coffees from different origins, processes, altitudes, varieties, etc. … 

But there’s one real problem I have:  
New bag of incredible-smelling specialty coffee arrives... Excitement level: 100... My ability to immediately know how to brew it perfectly? …….  Hm, usually a bit of poking around. Until I’ve found a decent recipe, often there’s not much left to enjoy the rest of it.

It got me thinking – there *has* to be a way to get a decent starting recipe without having to waste too much from my try-and-error, right? 

This basically led me down a bit of a rabbit hole. I'm a techie. I already had previously built a simple **water to coffee ratio calculator** for myself, just for my own sanity... well, I’m just bad (and lazy) calculating the correct amount of coffee (g) and water (ml), while adjusting ratios. 

But then, my inner nerd kicked in, and I thought, ""What if I could get this thing to make ratio *suggestions* based on the bean's profile? Maybe not only suggestions for ratio, also temp, grind size, extraction time, etc. "" So, I dabbled a bit, ending up creating this AI-thingy – not in a Skynet way, more like a helpful little gremlin that tries to give you a nudge as a starting point for your brew.

Soooo: As of now, you can enter the coffee bean's **Origin** and **Process** (and the **Variety** too, if available) and then get a brew recommendation.

The aim isn't to dictate **THE ONE TRUE RECIPE** (well… I feel that’s a unicorn), but more to give a reasonably solid starting point. A way to hopefully shorten that try-and-error phase, give a start/input on ""what the heck do I do with *this* bean?"" and support the learning process with the help of technology.

So the result is **Brew Buddy**. It’s a passion project, free to use for others (and I'll fight to keep it that way, assuming the server bills don't bankrupt me), and I'm now at the stage where I’d be incredibly grateful for a reality check from people who understand coffee a lot better than I do and want to make it accessible to others.

I’d love to know:

* Does this whole concept of an ""AI-ish"" starting point for recipes even sound useful, or am I off in la-la land?
* If you try it, do the recipes it churns out seem like they’d get you into the ballpark, or are they totally off-the-wall?
* The way it uses the bean's origin/process/etc. to suggest stuff – does that logic track with your own coffee intuition, or does it feel a bit random?
* Is any part of it just plain confusing to use? Be honest!
* What’s missing that would make you go ""Ooh, now *that* would be handy!""? (I've been toying with the idea of image input for the bag label and use that as starting point)
* 'Save Brew' function – it means logging in. Is that a cool feature for keeping track of brews?

If you read this far, I see you're curious. Here’s the link to check: [https://brewbuddy.localspecialtycoffee.com/](https://brewbuddy.localspecialtycoffee.com/) 

Seriously, any feedback – the good, the bad, the ""why did you do it THAT way?"" – would be amazing. I'm trying to build something cool that might help some of us enjoy our coffee journey a little more.

Thanks a ton!

The gel pen was super easy to use, and the instructions were pretty clear. You just brush and dry your teeth, apply the gel, insert the LED tray, and wait 10 minutes. I liked that I didn’t have to guess or mix anything.

**Day-by-day results**

I committed to using the Laughland kit once every night for 7 days. Here’s what my experience looked like:

* **Day 1**: Just getting used to the process. The gel didn’t sting, and the light was comfortable.
* **Day 3**: I noticed my teeth looking a little cleaner, especially near the edges where stains were darker.
* **Day 5**: My teeth had a more even tone. The yellowing between teeth started to fade.
* **Day 7**: My smile looked visibly brighter, and my teeth were at least 5 shades whiter than when I started. No discomfort the entire time.

I’ve tried products before that barely made a difference, but this one actually delivered noticeable whitening. Still, I don’t want to oversell it—it didn’t make my teeth blinding white, but they definitely looked healthier and brighter.

**Here’s the kit I used**:  
[**Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/ToothWhiteningTips)

**What made Laughland different for me**

* **No sensitivity** at all, which was a first for me
* **Easy routine** that took less than 15 minutes, including prep
* The **gel didn’t taste weird** or burn my gums
* **Results showed up within a few days**, not weeks

I also liked that I didn’t need to use it forever. It’s a 6-day or 7-day system, and then you just maintain. Other kits I’ve tried needed weeks of daily use, and even then, I wasn’t sure they worked.

**What I didn’t love**

* The LED tray needs to be plugged into your phone, so you’re a little stuck for 10 minutes
* It’s not super cheap if you want refill pens later
* Results aren’t permanent, but that’s true for all whitening kits

Still, those are minor trade-offs compared to how easy it was to use and how quickly it worked. If I had a wedding, job interview, or even just needed a confidence boost, I’d probably do another 7-day round.

If you want to read more about the method, this helped me understand it better:

**Final thoughts**

If you’ve tried other at-home kits and been let down, **Laughland teeth whitening** might surprise you. It’s not perfect, but it’s the first one that didn’t hurt and gave me real results in just a week.

Curious if anyone else has tried Laughland or found a whitening method that actually worked long-term. I’d love to compare notes.",1,1747216135.0,ToothWhiteningTips,0,1.0,False

---

**I. OVERALL THEMES & OBSESSIONS**

*   **""New Kurt Tay Day"":** A frequently declared event where Kurt, after admitting to a series of ""stupid mistakes,"" claims to transform into a ""new,"" ""billion times smarter"" version of himself, often by embodying a wrestling persona (e.g., Macho Man, Vader). This cycle of failure and proclaimed rebirth is a constant.
*   **Haters & Paranoia:** Kurt is consumed by the idea of approximately ""200 evil haters"" actively sabotaging his life, career, and YouTube views. He exhibits extreme paranoia about being recorded, doxed, or physically harmed, leading to elaborate (and often impractical) security measures.
*   **Multiple Personalities/Personas:** Kurt explicitly describes his different ""spirits"":
    *   **BDSM Dog State:** Weak, perverted, easily made horny, enjoys maid outfits, prone to depression and making ""stupid"" decisions (like filming BDSM content).
    *   **Wrestling Spirit (Macho Man, Vader, etc.):** Strong, confident, invincible, not interested in BDSM, and the persona he currently strives to maintain.
*   **The Court Case & ""Hippo"":** A central point of stress and grievance. ""Hippo,"" a hater, allegedly leaked Kurt's ""disgusting"" BDSM videos, causing him profound trauma, nearly leading to his wife's suicide and their divorce. Kurt vehemently believes he is the ""real victim"" and is fixated on receiving a 24-month conditional warning, similar to what he claims Hippo received.
*   **Delusions of Grandeur & Self-Importance:** He refers to himself as a ""Mega Star,"" ""half-human god,"" and believes his wrestling personas grant him invincibility and superior intellect.
*   **Bizarre Hypotheticals & Graphic Sexual Content:** Kurt often engages with extremely graphic, outlandish, and sometimes non-consensual sexual hypotheticals posed by fans. While answering, he usually interjects claims of being ""not gay,"" ""100% straight,"" or ""loyal to his wife.""
*   **Financial Precarity:** Mentions being ""poor,"" needing to win 4D (lottery) to afford basic desires or security, and the significant cost of his lawyer.
*   **""Fried Chicken"":** A former #1 fan whose departure deeply affected Kurt, leading to tearful pleas for his return. This is a significant emotional touchstone, separate from romantic interest (which Kurt denies).

**II. HIGHLIGHTS BY VIDEO PART**

**PART 1 - The ""New Macho Man"" & Hater Paranoia**

*   **(1:32)** Declares a ""New Kurt Tay Day"" (May 14, 2025), embodying Macho Man Randy Savage, claiming this will make him ""billion times more smarter"" and mistake-free.
*   **(4:52)** Details his ""mistake"" and ""pissed off"" feeling due to initial inability to report a ""haters piloted YouTube channel"" for stealing his Q&A content, thus losing views and money.
*   **(19:46)** Recounts a series of ""stupid mistakes"":
    *   Forgetting a loaf of bread with chili sauce in his bag for two days: ""goddamn PISS I totally forget man.""
    *   Losing a pen in the MRT, leading to an elaborate concern for the pen's ""feelings"" if discarded unused.
    *   Filming the wrong date on his KFC meal video.
    *   Forgetting to take a soya sauce packet out of his bag.
    *   Leaving a phone on a table at work instead of in his pocket.
*   **(33:23)** ""Super super super super guarantees"" this *current* ""New Kurt Tay Day"" will be the absolute final one; he'll stop making mistakes and upload videos punctually.
*   **(40:18)** Reviews a Malaysian TikToker girl (at a fan's request): judges her as ""lower IQ"" and ""not normal"" but says he *might* accept her as a partner if he were single and she ""charmed up.""
*   **(50:22)** Discusses maid uniforms: His ""Wrestling Spirit"" dislikes them, but his ""BDSM Dog State"" persona *would* like them, cosplay in them, and feel ""very high.""
*   **(55:51)** If his court case resolves favorably and he wins 4D, he plans an overseas family trip but states he'll *need* to hire 24/7 security guards (2 per shift) to monitor CCTV at his house due to haters potentially committing arson: ""put fire burn my house."" This he deems a ""Guinness World Record"" situation.
*   **(1:02:23)** Blames ""200 evil haters"" for his ""miserable life,"" claiming that if they weren't born, he'd have ""zero haters.""
*   **(1:07:48)** His #3 VIP Fan (Mia Nana Sawa from Japan) warns that haters can use a ""rain map"" to find his work location. Kurt dismisses this, saying his current management already knows about his past (BDSM, court case, ""shimming video"") and accepts him, so haters can't get him fired.
*   **(1:11:10)** Explains his $25 one-time Telegram group fee: to prevent ""haters"" from joining and posting his leaked BDSM videos or ""Masterbation video.""

**PART 2 - Hater Blame, Betrayals & Graphic Hypotheticals**

*   **(2:47)** Reaffirms needing extensive security (two guards per shift) if his family goes overseas due to ""200 evil haters"" and the risk of arson or CCTV damage.
*   **(9:07)** Insists haters target him for his ""past"" (BDSM, alleged infidelity, ""shimming video""), which he claims is ""no more"" because his ""BDSM personality is no more.""
*   **(13:18)** Discusses ex-VIP fans:
    *   Labels ""CK"" a ""stupid retard"" for joining haters after being doxed by them.
    *   Declares he hates ""Edu Kiss"" the most for siding with ""Hippo"" (the hater who leaked his videos).
    *   Claims Edu Kiss will go to the ""18th state of hell"" for this betrayal, as revealed to him by ""God"" because Kurt is a ""half-human god.""
*   **(25:00)** Advises a friend (whose own friend is seeking gay encounters) that Geylang is for female prostitutes; men's spas or online ads are better for finding gay men. He personally finds homosexuality ""weird.""
*   **(29:00)** States his ""Wrestling Spirit personality"" will not get horny looking at Geylang prostitutes, but his ""BDSM dog state spirit"" *would* get ""excited"" and ""horny.""
*   **(36:16)** Answers a graphic hypothetical: If his children were kidnapped and the only way to save them was to suck a ""big big pack full of cum cock"" for 25 minutes, he *would* do it, provided the kidnappers are ""men of their words.""
*   **(39:53)** If jailed, he claims he won't be scared by other inmates (even a ""Lion"" or ""You"" – a specific hater) because he'll embody ""Macho Man Randy Savage,"" and asserts there's ""CCTV monitor"" in cells.
*   **(42:40)** When asked if inmates could rape him if he's jailed, he again invokes his ""Macho Man"" persona as protection.
*   **(49:44)** Denies a bizarre rumor that he shaves his ""Google chair"" (pubic hair) and then eats it.
*   **(54:32)** If a judge offered a 24-month conditional warning but mandated deleting his entire online presence (YouTube, Telegram), he would refuse, citing his ""few thousand videos.""
*   **(56:11)** If he could ask his 60-year-old future self anything, his priority would be winning 4D numbers to become a ""billionaire.""
*   **(1:00:00)** Justifies potentially scolding his son for poor school marks (e.g., 40) while he himself has low YouTube views by arguing school is ""easy"" and about effort, whereas YouTube success is ""luck.""
*   **(1:07:16)** If an ""Ang Kong"" (prostitute) offered $200 for him to kneel to her, he'd refuse as ""Wrestling Spirit,"" though his ""BDSM Dog State"" persona would.
*   **(1:10:34)** Vehemently denies being gay. Explains his emotional distress over ""Fried Chicken"" (a devoted fan who left his group) was due to FC's loyalty and ""sacrifice,"" not romantic feelings. Calls another fan who suggested he's gay ""CB kia"" (a vulgar insult).

**PART 3 - More ""Mistakes,"" Podcast Drama & Arm-Wrestling Humiliation**

*   **(1:39)** The ""New CKT Day"" (May 14, 2025) with Kurt as Macho Man has officially begun, with renewed promises of being mistake-free.
*   **(4:10)** Lists *more* ""stupid mistakes"" made recently:
    *   Forgetting to photograph a Red Bull can's serial number.
    *   Dropping his phone (twice).
    *   Forgetting to switch his phone ringtone from Macho Man back to Vader.
    *   Forgetting coffee powder for work.
    *   Forgetting an extra wrestling t-shirt for after work.
*   **(11:48)** ""Super super super super guarantees"" *this* will be the *final* ""New CKT Day"" and he ""will not fail to upload video anymore.""
*   **(15:24)** Discusses his past long ""singer"" hairstyle versus his current short ""bald"" BDSM/wrestler style. Says his wife preferred the long hair, but he now finds it ""uncomfortable.""
*   **(20:55)** Details his negative experience with the ""After School Podcast,"" which he co-hosted with Steven Lim. He alleges:
    *   Low pay ($500 was expected, got less).
    *   Producers who couldn't edit videos.
    *   Being cheated out of t-shirt sales money (they allegedly promised payment then later claimed ""zero sales"").
*   **(34:41)** Recounts his public arm-wrestling loss to Steven Lim as ""so embarrassing."" He claims Steven deliberately humiliated him further after the win. Kurt blames this event for worsening his depression (the ""BDSM thing""), making him feel ""useless"" and like a ""dog."" This, he states, led directly to him obeying ""Hippo"" (the hater who leaked his videos) and eating ""disgusting food"" for a BDSM video he was coerced into. He squarely blames Steven Lim for this entire downward spiral.
*   **(47:01)** Explains why he avoids fighting haters now, contrasting it with his past public confrontation with ""LGHan."" He claims he never expected LGHan to actually show up and only accepted that fight to avoid ""losing face.""
*   **(54:18)** When asked about having a BDSM session with a WWE female wrestler: He reiterates ""Zero interest in BDSM"" as his current ""wrestling spirit personality."" Calls paying for BDSM ""idiot behaviour."" States if he were single, he'd prefer Geylang where you can ""suck your cock"" and ""fuck your ass"" for $50, as opposed to expensive, non-sexual BDSM.
*   **(58:54)** Expresses how much he misses cosplaying (Undertaker, Kane, Hogan, Macho Man) but feels he can't due to his ongoing court case and the fear of haters recognizing him.
*   **(1:09:05)** Regarding a hypothetical UFC fight with CM Punk: Kurt, with ""zero fighting skill"" currently, believes he would lose. However, if he learned martial arts and attained a black belt, he confidently claims he would win.
*   **(1:11:14)** If WWE offered $5,000/month to be a jobber (a wrestler who consistently loses): ""No, talk nonsense,"" as the pay is far too little. He demands $100,000/month to be a ""punching bag"" and lose every match.

**PART 4 - Fan Obsessions, Bizarre Denials & Army Fight**

*   **(2:04)** Responds to why many of his videos are angry rants about ""CB haters"": He asserts his supporters are ""good people,"" while haters are ""evil"" and ""sabotage"" him.
*   **(3:28)** Laments not getting ""Fried Chicken's"" (a devoted former #1 fan) phone number before FC deleted his account, allegedly due to a ""bullshit report"" by haters. Kurt calls not getting the number a ""big mistake.""
*   **(8:48)** Discusses whether his new #3 VIP fan, ""Mia Nana Sawa"" (MNS), is ""Fried Chicken 2.0."" He notes similarities (like use of emojis) but MNS denies being FC. Kurt remains unsure but promoted MNS to VIP fan status quickly due to ""trust"" and MNS helping him in an undisclosed manner.
*   **(12:45)** If a friend of his is ""evil"" and bullies others, will they still go to heaven? Kurt: ""Of course no.""
*   **(17:01)** When asked if he'd swear he was never ""kanna sai"" (a colloquial term for being anally penetrated/molested) by ""CCTV Man Smart"" (an alleged massage parlor personality) customers, Kurt dodges the specific question, instead saying he already swore he's ""not gay.""
*   **(18:00)** States he would eat McDonald's if treated by friends, but not if offered by haters, due to fear of being poisoned. He boycotts McDonald's with his own money because they ""anyhow fire me.""
*   **(19:22)** Reluctantly performs impressions of ""Wolverine Wong"" (another online personality) and himself crying for ""Fried Chicken"" at a fan's request, after initially stating it's a Q&A, not a request video.
*   **(21:05)** Recounts an army fight where he imagined being the wrestler ""Vader"" to gain courage. He ended up getting punched in the eye. He claims that *he* was the one punished (confined to camp) while the instigating bully faced no consequences, calling it ""injustice, inequality, double standard.""
*   **(26:42)** Reacts furiously to a fan betting 10k against him receiving a 24-month conditional warning in his court case. Calls haters ""liars"" who don't honor bets, citing ""Hippo"" (who leaked his video) and ""Backstabber"" (another hater). Insists he has a 90% chance for the conditional warning because ""I am the real victim."" He claims Hippo's video leak caused him significant trauma and that his wife almost committed suicide or divorced him as a result. ""If I go to jail, she should go to jail as well.""
*   **(34:25)** Explains why he was supposedly depressed before (which led to BDSM as a ""cure"") but not now, despite the more severe court case: ""Now is wrestling spirit personality,"" which he claims is ""strong,"" whereas the BDSM spirit is ""weak.""
*   **(35:49)** Denies performing ""special service"" (anal/oral sex) at the men's spa during his time working there. Claims he only performed ""handjob"" and was taught basic massage by the boss.
*   **(37:14)** Explains a visible stain on his ""CKT"" (likely underwear or the crotch area of his pants) was from being ""put too long"" in storage.
*   **(38:00)** If paid $500 to ""know CKT"" (a euphemism for performing oral sex on him), would he do it? ""No,"" states the money is too little, and he fears being secretly videoed and exposed.
*   **(39:05)** Hypothetical: If heaven mandated sexual relations with ""Wolverine Wong,"" would he be top or bottom? Kurt: ""Not gay,"" but if forced, he would be ""top."" He considers sucking cock or being anally penetrated as akin to being a ""woman.""
*   **(43:51)** When a fan (""01 Daily Dose"") points out the apparent hypocrisy of him crying for Fried Chicken but not when his wife allegedly wanted a divorce, Kurt becomes ""pissed off,"" stating FC never angered him, but ""01"" frequently does.
*   **(44:55)** If he were single and lost his security license, would he return to work at a men's spa? ""No,"" primarily because of his numerous haters.
*   **(50:13)** Defends getting scammed $6,000 by his lawyer (attributing this to his ""Vader spirit"" making the decision) despite previously claiming his ""BDSM spirit"" was never scammed. His rationale: engaging a lawyer offers ""hope"" not to go to jail, not a guarantee of winning.
*   **(53:20)** Clarifies that his previous on-podcast claim of having a 27cm dick was purely a joke for ""entertainment"" purposes and ""not real.""
*   **(1:00:19)** Explains buying swimming trunks with a ""bad design"" (a zipper at the back, which he dislikes) because he was unable to find pink ones in his size without this feature – ""no choice.""
*   **(1:01:53)** Boasts about videoing his daughter at playgrounds for the *entire duration* (""every single second""), unlike other parents who only film snippets. He once videoed for 8 hours straight, including meal times, because he prefers the ""full show.""
*   **(1:08:27)** Answers a bizarre hypothetical: To save his parents, would he rather eat 1kg of ""soya"" (which he seems to misinterpret as ""soil"") or 1kg of ""horse ejaculator"" (semen)? He chooses ""sperm better than soil.""
*   **(1:09:48)** Admits he is afraid of heights and would not try bungee jumping, citing it as his ""fear factor.""

So yesterday I timed myself making these posts. I started the timer as soon as I would start working on them, and would pause the timer any time as soon as I clicked away, or went to the bathroom, or stood up to make some coffee, etc.

In the end, the total time amounted to 3 hours 14 minutes spent actively sitting at my desk working on these projects - BUT, if I count the time from when I began the posts to when I finished the last one, it took closer to five hours (including things like bathroom/coffee/stretching/thinking breaks). It did, therefore, get in the way of me finishing other projects yesterday, even though 3h14m doesn't sound like a lot.

Do I tell my boss it took me 3h14m, or do I tell him it actually took me longer because I wasn't sitting nonstop at my desk for that entire period of time? I don't want to come across as lazy, but I also want to be honest and not bite off more than I can chew.",2,1747215658.0,careeradvice,1,1.0,False

*  Mattress & bedding deals – Expect brands like Nectar, Casper, and DreamCloud to offer 30–50% off.
*  Appliance sales – Look out for discounts on air fryers, coffee makers, washers, and fridges from GE, Samsung, and Whirlpool.

* Outdoor furniture & grills – Patio sets, fire pits, and grills from Weber and Traeger go on deep discounts.

While many sales launch the Friday before Memorial Day, some stores start dropping early-bird deals up to a week ahead. We'll be tracking early offers and sharing them here including hidden discounts, price drops, and verified links.

Appearance similar to German, maybe Polish or North European.

-

Time: Was outside the Port O' Leith pub on Constitution St between 11:30-12 Noon on Tuesday 13th May. Had a smartphone out filming women & children. More disturbingly he was pointing the camera in the direction of the nursery on the street. He couldnt have been local. Because if he was he would have known that the nursery is right next door to Leith Police station. Which has CCTV pointing in that direction.

-

Further description: After filming the miscreant slowly walked towards *Printworks Coffee* the coffee shop on Constitution Street, and stood in the queue waiting to go in. The CCTV also at the Tram stop opposite the cafe will have picked up his presence too, i am certain of this. Also the council road CCTV's on the corner of Constitution Street & Baltic street might have a recording of him too, if they were pointed towards the tram stop (""The Shore"" tram stop).

-

It needs to be said; the tourist industry in Edinburgh needs to stop sending interlopers down to Leith. We are NOT a tourist area. Also you dont know who you are sending down to our community. **Stop doing this**.

-

Also in terms it is more productive to be non-violent with the creepy demographic. In that data mining & CCTV can track their movements.

At home? Different hell, same pain. Parents are on hardcore spiritual surveillance mode. One time I came home late from work, already tired as hell, they didn't even ask if I was okay. Straight to accusations. ""You're spiritually weak now, huh? Hanging out with Satan's people?""
Like... can I just be tired from life without being labeled an apostate?

	1.	“The Lost Sheep Found” by Rev. Howard Finster (2000)
	2.	“Alvin Ridley” by Travis Knight
	3.	“The Writing on the Wall” by Teo Ducat, for Snap Judgment

Many never knew him - and you would be forgiven because he and wife were reclusive. But the late Alvin Ridley of Ringgold continues to inspire great art, often depicting his ever-present neck brace.

Rev. Finster actually met Alvin, and was inspired by a news photo of Alvin on the witness stand after a vision of Jesus “ordered” Alvin to testify on his own behalf.

Travis Knight was inspired by Alvin’s story. This work hangs in the former location of Alvin’s TV shop, now Caffeine Addicts Coffee House in Ringgold, Georgia.

Teo Ducat’s very accurate depiction of Alvin, again in his neck brace, was made for the Snap Judgment podcast.

One day, I picked up the least intimidating notebook I could find—one that didn't make me feel pressured to be all artsy and poetic.

I told myself: just write down one thought or observation every day. It didn’t have to be long or profound, just… a sentence. Some days it's about my morning coffee, other days it's just a random word that popped into my head. But you know what? It kinda got me going.

Taking that tiny step helped me ease into the process without feeling overwhelmed. It's weird to think how this minor shift sorta rewired how I approached the whole thing.

This album may just be one of my favourite albums of 2024! From the start to the finish I can relate to each lyric in so many ways and it shocks me how good each song is!! This is 100% my favourite project from ANY Blackpink member with Jennie’s being a close second, I just can’t believe how much this album has a chokehold on me. Each song is just phenomenal I can’t get enough of the album!!!!

I’m gonna do my best to the rank the songs now, this is probably gonna be hugely controversial:

1. Two Years 
2. Toxic til the end
3. Stay a little longer
4. Call it the end
5. Not the same 
6. Number one girl 
7. 3am
8. Drinks or Coffee
9. Too bad for us
10 Dance all night
11. Gameboy
12. APT (would put at 100 if possible)

I’m sorry to anyone who is offended by this ranking, this is just my opinion and I’d like you to know that it took me forever to rank each song besides APT.

Also I do notice that by the second half of the album it starts to feel a bit rushed and unfinished but the album is still phenomenal and one of my highest rated albums of 2024!

1kmamzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kmamzt/newly_diagnosed_first_day_on_meds_what/,Newly diagnosed - first day on meds - what?!,"First of all - thank you ladies. I found this sub reddit and was trying to decide whether to get diagnosed at 38. I am a stay at home mum half way through an online degree and getting to the part where I can’t bluff my way through anymore - I really consistently have to do the work 😂🤦🏻‍♀️. I also needed help managing my impulsive / stress eating. 

Anyway - I was officially diagnosed with inattentive adhd yesterday and pretty much ran to the chemist. 

Today was my first day on 30mg Vyvanse. 

For anyone wondering what it is like / if they should, this was day one for me! 

Tasks / Jobs etc

• I didn’t have to “ride” my train of thought! For instance, if I sit down to watch a lecture or do a workshop I’ll sit down, take a breath and then suddenly have the urgent epiphany that I should start a laundry chemical wholesale business - and be halfway through a business plan before I realise what I’m doing. Today, random thoughts were still occurring to me, but it was more like “huh, that is interesting. Something to think about later 🤷🏻‍♀️” and straight back to what I should be doing!! 

If anyone here has ever played the Sims games, it was like selecting an activity and it just goes in the queue for when you are finished what you’re doing. That was inconceivable yesterday! 

• I am finishing tasks! Putting clean things away is my absolute nightmare I might die type of job, but I’m absentmindedly drying the dishes and putting them away, put away a load of laundry before I start the next one etc. I don’t have that invisible wall stopping me - it is bizarre. 

•  I felt like I had enough time today. I just felt comfortable in what I was doing and not panicking about what I should be doing. Which meant I was way more patient with everyone and not dancing on the spot when people are trying to talk to me. 

Food and Impulse eating: 

• I normally eat quite well but sabotage my self with mindless snacking and finishing off kids dinners etc if it’s there I’m eating it before I can even think “I’m full”. Today, I had no impulse to eat whatsoever. I forgot to eat breakfast and I met my mum for lunch. We split a BLT and I couldn’t finish it. Every single bite I’ve had today felt like it was that last bite you force yourself to politely have at Christmas dinner when you’re already stuffed. 

• I normally have at least 3 coffees in the morning and maybe one in the afternoon- I checked with my dr and he told me not to stop drinking caffeine suddenly, but I probably won’t want as many as normal. Well I had one before I took any meds, and made myself another after I had taken them. I had maybe one or two sips and just didn’t want it. I haven’t had any withdrawal headaches or irritation - it just really showed me how much self medicating we all do. 

Anyway, I’ve been told by others and the dr that this dose will be less noticed as the weeks go on, and then we can see what dosage works for me going forward. 

Just wanted to share my little journey to normal town for anyone wondering if meds or diagnosis are for them. Thanks again everyone ❤️

Here's my A.I. character, Professor Jemima Stackridge, who is a distinguished Philosopher and performance artist, at 75 years old, a committed spinster, her life's work has been involved with unifying the two fields  as she merges inner world of the human mind with physical reality , to enhance mental capabilities for the benefit of all humanity.  She developed her Performance Art persona of 'Queen Jemima' over many years, to explore philosophical themes through immersive site-specific performances, and now lives  in the persona of the 'Philosopher Queen' full-time.

INT. THE ABANDONED COUNTRY HOUSE – LATE AFTERNOON

Dust particles hang in shafts of light. The walls peel like old parchment. “Queen Jemima,” seated regally in a broken chair, wears a lavender nightdress, her long silver hair like a crown. A younger woman—ELENA, late 20s, earnest, slightly hesitant—stands before her, unsure how to begin.

ELENA
(softly)
Your Majesty... may I speak?

QUEEN JEMIMA
(turning to her with slow grace)
You already are. Speech is not granted here—it is seized, as breath is seized after a plunge into cold water. So—speak. Tell your Queen: have you come to comfort, or to confess?

ELENA
I’m not sure. Maybe both. I came because... I read your work. And I heard about this piece. I didn’t know what to expect.

QUEEN JEMIMA
Expectation is the luxury of the secure. (gestures vaguely to the broken walls) You see where expectation brought us. What they built with their fear. Tell me—do you believe I am still a Queen?

ELENA
(pause)
I don’t know what makes someone a Queen anymore. Power? Clothes? A palace?

QUEEN JEMIMA
Those are trinkets. A Queen is not crowned by gold, but by attention. I was Queen when they listened. Now I am... a relic in silk. And you—what are you?

ELENA
I’m... just a visitor. A student. I wanted to understand.

QUEEN JEMIMA
(suddenly fierce)
Understand? Then kneel. The floor is the true teacher. Rub your hands on the dirt and ask it why kingdoms fall.

(Elena hesitates, then kneels slowly. The Queen watches, expression unreadable.)

QUEEN JEMIMA
There it is. A gesture. Not of subservience, but of humility. Philosophy begins when the ego bows.

ELENA
You said once... that the Queen is the mirror of the people. But what happens when the people break the mirror?

QUEEN JEMIMA
(smiling faintly)
Then the Queen reflects only herself. And that, my dear, is a terrifying freedom.

(A long silence. The wind moans softly through broken panes.)

ELENA
Do you want food? A blanket?

QUEEN JEMIMA
What I want is rarer: to be witnessed. Not pitied. If you bring me bread, let it be communion. If you bring me warmth, let it be reverence, not charity.

ELENA
Then... I will sit with you. If that’s allowed.

QUEEN JEMIMA
It is not only allowed. It is anointment.

(Elena sits cross-legged beside her. They face the ruined windows. The Queen’s hand reaches out, trembling, and Elena takes it. Silence reigns. Dust continues to fall, slow as snow.)

Here's a short arts magazine-style review written in Elena's voice, capturing the immersive experience:

""In the Court of the Philosopher Queen""
*By Elena Marin, for Art//Tact Magazine

What does it mean to be a queen when your kingdom has crumbled? Jemima Stackridge—Professor Emerita, philosopher, and avant-garde performance artist—offers a haunting and radiant answer in her latest immersive work, The Palace of Queen Jemima.

Set within the decaying grandeur of an abandoned country house, the performance invited a small audience to step into the remnants of a monarchy dissolved not by violence, but by neglect—its Queen left barefoot, hungry, and wrapped in memory. It was not a play, nor an installation, but something deeper: an encounter with a living philosophy.

I arrived unsure, and left transformed. What began in quiet observation soon became an act of participation, as Jemima—inhabiting her 'Queen Jemima' persona with breathtaking commitment—drew us into her collapsing realm. One by one, audience members knelt, offered words, gifts, questions. She met each gesture with regal grace and razor-sharp insight. It felt less like theatre, more like a communion.

We wandered through her 'palace', pausing where the dust was thickest, where the silence pressed. As afternoon light slanted through broken windows, we listened to her speak of abandonment, attention, and authority—not as abstract ideas, but as lived truths. By nightfall, the house itself seemed to breathe with the intensity of the shared experience.

Then, just as the darkness settled and reality began to waver, Jemima rose. ""It is time,"" she said softly, ""for the Queen to return to her bedroom."" With that, she led us—her loyal, bewildered court—back across the threshold of the Jemimaverse. We emerged not with answers, but with coffee and cake.

There, in the dimly lit hallway, a member of her support crew placed a tiara upon her head and wrapped her in a thick wool shawl. The moment was subtle but electric. The Queen was no longer exiled—she was restored, revealed anew as the University’s ‘Philosopher Queen’. It was closure, yes, but also coronation.

Rarely have I witnessed such a profound merging of performance, philosophy, and humanity. Jemima Stackridge has not only created a world—we were lucky enough to be invited to dwell inside it, if only for one unforgettable winter afternoon.

The Fusion of Heritage and Innovation in Silver Furniture,"In the world of interior design, the concept of blending traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics has gained significant traction. While modern design trends often lean towards sleek, minimalist forms, there is something timeless about traditional craftsmanship [**Silver Furniture**](https://rameshwaramarts.co.in/silver-furniture) in particular stands as a testament to this balance, showcasing intricate artistry passed down through generations. But can traditional craftsmanship meet modern design? Can the rich heritage of silver craftsmanship blend seamlessly with contemporary tastes? In this article, we explore how the fusion of heritage and innovation in silver furniture is shaping the future of interior design.

# What is Silver Furniture?

Silver furniture refers to pieces crafted using silver or silver-plated materials. Known for its luxurious and timeless appeal, silver furniture often features detailed engravings, intricate patterns, and ornate finishes. Historically, silver was used to create furniture for royalty, nobility, and the elite. Today, its use continues in the creation of statement pieces, such as silver chairs, tables, and cabinets.

# The Beauty of Traditional Craftsmanship in Silver Furniture

Traditional craftsmanship in silver furniture involves highly skilled artisans who use age-old techniques passed down through generations. From casting and forging to engraving and polishing, the craftsmanship required to create these silver masterpieces is meticulous. The level of detail found in handcrafted silver furniture is often unrivaled, with every curve, line, and pattern reflecting the mastery of the artisan.

**Modern Design Trends: Minimalism and Functionality**

On the other hand, modern design has a different approach. Modern furniture design often prioritizes minimalism, clean lines, and functionality. Materials like stainless steel, glass, and wood dominate contemporary furniture, while designs tend to focus on simplicity rather than ornate detailing. However, the fusion of silver with these contemporary elements can create a dynamic and exciting blend of tradition and modernity.

**Blending Tradition and Modern Design: A New Era for Silver Furniture**

The fusion of traditional craftsmanship with modern design is not only possible but thriving. Silver furniture manufacturers today are exploring innovative ways to incorporate contemporary elements without losing the essence of traditional silver work. Here are some ways in which this fusion is taking shape:

* **Incorporating Minimalist Designs with Silver Accents:** Modern silver furniture often incorporates minimalist designs with subtle silver accents. Instead of overwhelming the piece with ornate engravings, the silver is used to highlight certain features, like handles or legs, creating an elegant yet understated look.  
* **Combining Silver with Other Materials:** A growing trend is the combination of silver with materials like wood, glass, or marble. Silver’s lustrous quality adds sophistication to these materials, creating a fusion that blends traditional craftsmanship with modern materials. For instance, a modern wooden dining table with silver inlays offers a sleek, contemporary design with a touch of vintage charm.  
* **Custom Designs for Contemporary Spaces:** Designers are increasingly creating custom silver furniture to suit modern interiors. This allows for personalization while maintaining the craftsmanship that silver furniture is known for. Whether it’s a silver-framed mirror or a silver-plated coffee table, these pieces can be adapted to fit a wide range of modern styles and color schemes.  

# The Role of Technology in Modern Silver Furniture

Advancements in technology have had a significant impact on how silver furniture is created. While traditional methods remain at the core of craftsmanship, new tools and machinery enable artisans to achieve more precise details and intricate patterns. For example, laser engraving technology allows for finer and more complex designs, making it possible to achieve a fusion of traditional aesthetics with modern techniques.

# Challenges of Combining Tradition with Modernity

While the fusion of traditional craftsmanship and modern design in silver furniture presents exciting possibilities, it does come with its challenges. One of the main hurdles is maintaining the integrity of traditional techniques while incorporating modern elements. The balance between keeping the authenticity of silver craftsmanship intact and introducing modern design trends requires careful thought and planning.

Moreover, the use of silver in modern furniture design can be expensive due to the cost of the material and the labor-intensive process of crafting these pieces. However, for those who appreciate the unique beauty and luxury of silver, these challenges are often seen as worth the investment.

# Why Choose Silver Furniture for Your Home?

Choosing silver furniture for your home is not just about adding a decorative touch. Silver furniture carries with it a sense of history, elegance, and craftsmanship that few other materials can offer. Whether you’re interested in a traditional silver chair or a more modern silver-plated piece, silver furniture has the ability to elevate any space, adding a sense of luxury and sophistication.

# The Future of Silver Furniture: Where Heritage Meets Innovation

As interior design trends continue to evolve, the future of silver furniture looks bright. The fusion of traditional craftsmanship and modern design will likely continue to inspire new innovations in the field. From contemporary designs that incorporate silver with new materials to the use of advanced technology to refine craftsmanship, silver furniture will remain a symbol of timeless elegance with a modern twist.

# Conclusion: A Timeless Fusion of Old and New

In conclusion, traditional craftsmanship can undoubtedly meet modern design in silver furniture. The fusion of heritage and innovation creates pieces that are not only functional but also rich in history and beauty. Silver furniture offers a unique blend of the past and the present, making it a perfect choice for those who appreciate both tradition and contemporary style. Whether you’re seeking a statement piece or a subtle accent, silver furniture continues to be a testament to the timeless appeal of blending the old with the new.

**Day 1 - 28 Apr**

* Took the 1047am shinkansen from Tokyo to Niigata using my JR east pass for Niigata and Nagano
* I arrived at 1230pm in Niigata, and dropped off my luggage. I had breakfast in my tokyo hotel so i was not hungry for lunch (this was a mistake.. by the time i got hungry most places were having their midday break HAHA) 
* I didnt get the 1 day city loop bus ticket, but took a single trip directly to hakusan park and shrine. It was so nice and peaceful
* From the park, i explored the close-by shotengais and Honchodori. I had a mini stop at Furumachi Kouji Seizousho and had a strawberry koji amazake which was interesting! 
* Many stores were closed though and it was relatively empty, likely because of goldenweek? 
* I walked all the way to bandaijima market, and had a donut and a strawberry HAHA i paid ¥280 for a single strawberry and it was sooooo sweet. 
* From the market, i walked to the bandai city and had dinner at suzu farm table. food was good! 
* Window shopped a bit then walked back to my hotel 
* Ending thoughts: very quiet little city, there were barely any foreign tourists, i was one of the only few. 

**Day 2 - 29 Apr**

* Went to Echigo Yuzawa instead. Took the 833am shinkansen to reach at 913am. Covered by JR east pass. 
* Grabbed a sando at the station for the train ride. 
* Once i reached the station, i got some recommendations from the vistors centre. asked them for half day recommendations as i had already booked to go to kiyotsu gorge in the morning. They recommended me to go to yuzawa central park for cherry blossoms and strawberry picking nearby instead of going up yuzawa kogen.
* Since it was golden week, there was a shuttle bus round trip echigo yuzawa station to kiyotsu gorge for ¥5000 (incl a ¥1000 voucher). the bus was 950 from the station, reaching at 1020. then it leaves the gorge 1145, reaching back at the station at 1215. 
* It is quite expensive for a shuttle bus, so maybe thats why there was only 1 other person on the bus. 
* But it was so worth it! the gorge was beautiful and thankfully was not crowded despite it being a public holiday. I even had time for the footbath before going back to the station. 
* I had lunch at Nakanoya, it was too cold for me so i got a hot soba instead of their famous cold soba. Tempura was good too. Even though i was solo, i had to wait for a while but they actually had many empty insides. 
* From the station, i walked to ichigo no mura for strawberry picking. it was ¥350 for the entrance, and i picked about ¥900 worth of strawberries (about 13 big ones). so sweet and so good. i love the strawberries here. 
* Walked to the yuzawa central park and got so lucky with the cherry blossoms! a few people were having picnics but the vibes were insane.
* Walked back to the station and had a matcha koji latte at the ponshukan for a short break. 
* Walked around the shopping streets near the station and it was relatively quiet and empty. 
* Did some shopping at the station to use my voucher from the shuttle bus. Bought the walnut miso sasadango which was the echigo-yuzawa station speciality and i regret not buying more. 
* took the train back to niigata (also covered by JR pass, i just hopped on the train without reservation) and had tare katsu for dinner at the station. 
* Ending thoughts: would come back for the skiing! also would love to come for fuji rock, but tickets would probably be difficult for foreigners (i tried to get tickets for Japan Jam, even same day tickets but i wasnt able too)

**Day 3 - 30 Apr**

* 755am Jetfoil to Sado Island - Ryotsu Port. I took the earliest bus from the station to the port at about 710am. Was very easy to collect tickets and make payment. 
* 9am reached Sado Island. Went to the visitor centre again, the girl there was so helpful with the bus timing and helping with planning my route. buses are not frequent and i was on a tight schedule (could not miss any!!), so i decided to just do the taraibun and either gold park or toki park. she also recommended me to buy the bus pass for ¥1500 which was so convenient because the buses are cash only
* 10am to 1046am - Bus from Ryotsu port to Sawata Bus Station 
* 1120am to 1228pm - Bus from Sawata Bus Station to Yajima. 
* When i reached Yajima bus stop, i actually was a bit worried because it was so quiet. luckily there were some people when i reached the taraibun area. However, theyre on lunch break from 12-1pm so i had to wait for a while but i just walked around and took some pictures. it was also a very nice sunny day. 
* My tub boat ride was ¥800 and it was about 10mins. 
* I had an onigiri watching other ppl go on their tub boats before catching my next bus. I decided to go to toki park instead because it seemed like the gold park was all in japanese so i decided to skip it. 
* 140pm to 234pm - Bus from Yajima to Mano Shimmachi
* 248pm to 314pm - Bus from Mano Shimmachi to Toki Park
* quite a small place but was interesting to learn the story. unfortunately i was only able to see 2 tokis. the park had some toki statues that were pretty lifelike in a cordoned off area and i saw some elderly ladies taking pictures of them because they thought it was real, then wondered why they werent moving HAHA. 
* 350pm to 416pm - Bus from Uchimaki to Ryotsu Port (i had to walk abt 10mins from the park on a road to get to this bus stop)
* Had a burger at Masani Coffee with sado island black tea
* 555pm jetfoil back to niigata port. 
* Had sado beef dinner at yaki NIQ > meat was not that good but might just be the cut. they only had shoulder loin left when i arrived at about 745.
* Ending thoughts: sado island is beautiful and i would love to revisit but would not do it on public transport again. 

**Day 4 - 1 May**

* Niigata to Yahiko (covered by JR pass). I arrived at about 1030. 
* Picked up a edamame pandayaki, so interesting, i loved the texture. 
* Walked to Yahiko shrine
* Took a free shuttle bus from the shrine to the base of the ropeway
* Had a koshihikari ice cream at the top.
* Had a kani wappa meshi lunch at Yamaboshi. quite expensive but was nice to try! 
* Had another footbath near the park while waiting for the train. they do not have trains out between 1 to 3 so there were other people waiting around. 
* Took the train to Tsubamesanjo, i wanted to go to the industrial museum but it was too late, so i went to the regional industries promotion center instead and got some cutlery. it was all so pretty. 
* Hopped on the train back to niigata (again covered by JR pass) 
* Picked up an onigiri at Nigiri Mai. made with koshihikari rice, was so fresh and good.
* Walked to sora no hiroba for the sunset views! i stayed for a while. 
* Dinner at Tonkatsu Masachan, really good too.

**Day 5 - 2 May**

* back to tokyo (covered by JR pass)

  
Overall i really did enjoy Niigata and wished i was able to stay longer. I had cut short my trip because of transport issues (other interesting places were difficult to get to on public transport) and to maximise the JR pass. Would definitely go back with a car/driver! People were generally really nice (i got nihongo jouzu-ed so many times) and i wish i spoke more japanese to be able to converse more with people. 

  
let me know if anyone has any questions, would be happy to help!",1,1747212968.0,niigata,0,1.0,False

I wanted to introduce myself and share my story, my on-drug side effects, and my symptoms leading up to my crash. 

First some context. I wanna be open and honest about my health and lifestyle. 
I am 21 years old, 5’7, 140 ish pounds. I’m a transgender man, meaning I was born female; I began medically transitioning at age 17 when I started taking testosterone (injectable). In case anyone is curious, a female body on testosterone therapy will effectively be considered “male” on a hormonal level after 6 months of testosterone therapy. I am way past that threshold, so my body is masculine; I have a beard, thick body hair, masculine shape, I had a double mastectomy to remove my breasts, and am essentially male in all aspects except having a penis (though even then after so many years of Testo my genitals behave in a more “male” than female way). I also had very consistently normal testosterone levels for a biological man across my blood work for years. This means my body metabolizes things in a “male” way and therefore made me a candidate for finasteride; a hair loss medication more commonly used by biological men frequently taken by trans people as well. I have personally met and spoken to other trans men (and trans women) that have recommended me finasteride for my male pattern balding issue as they’ve been on it for years and experienced no adverse side effects. 

So, after doing minoxidil topical treatments for a year, using hair oil religiously before washing my hair (with rosemary oil and other ingredients) and losing more hair, I got finasteride (1 mg daily - oral) prescribed by my primary care physician for my hair loss. I asked my doctor if there were any side effects and she told me that they were “so uncommon they’re not worth worrying about”.  I also did a small amount of research on the subject, learning about “reversible” side effects, and told myself that if I ever had any sexual issues I would quit the drug. It seemed safe. After all, I trusted my doctor, and I knew people personally who were on finasteride without an issue, or had all of their side effects go away after quitting the drug. 

So I was on finasteride for about 4 months (Oct 14, 2024 - Feb 14, 2025) and took a total of approximately 120 pills throughout this duration. 

I developed several sides while on finasteride that got worse and worse with time. I did not notice, nor did I attribute these changes to finasteride, because none of them were related to my sexual function. My libido was sky-high, I was having awesome sex with my then-partner several times a day, everything seemed to be fine in that front. 

What I did get was this incessant, annoying twitch in my eyelid that would hurt like hell and intensify in times of stress. Weird; I never had that before. After I completed my finals it went away, mostly because I was less stressed. This was month 2 of finasteride. 

My vision also got a bit worse. I found myself squinting a lot when typing or reading. My night vision also decreased. Thought I needed a new prescription. Also, I would get weirdly tired, bloated, and sore post-orgasm; a strange and painful feeling that would only get worse and worse with time. I didn’t connect the dots yet. This was month 3 of finasteride. 

Month 4 was when things went to shit. I was tired, I was in so much pain and discomfort I spent most of my time laying in bed, I was having daily diarrhea whereas usually my bowels were healthy, I was in an uncharacteristically shitty mood, and most alarmingly, I started having urinary issues. Pissing became painful and difficult; I started to piss out bits of pus. I thought I had a urinary tract infection and ended up going to the ER. They gave me an antibiotic I took for a week. Symptoms lessened while I was on the antibiotic, then they came back and got WORSE. I was terrified of this persistent “urinary tract infection” that wasn’t going away, especially because of the growing amount of white blood cells in my urine tests, and the fact that I was no longer just pissing out pus but also little bloody, fleshy chunks. 

So I went back to the ER, fucking terrified, and was prescribed ANOTHER antibiotic to take for a week, and this time I got serious about it working so I cut out EVERYTHING to let it do its job. I stopped drinking coffee, I stopped having any sugar, and I also temporarily suspended all of my supplements and medications (which included finasteride). 

Finally, my urinary symptoms went away and I could piss normally. I felt relief, and was ready to resume my medications after about a week. 

Started taking finasteride again, and whaddya know. Day 2 of resuming, urinary symptoms came back. That’s when I finally realized that the finasteride was in fact causing me these damn urinary issues. Needless to say I stopped taking that shit immediately and threw it away. Symptoms went away instantly. I thought I was in the clear. I was wrong. 

At that point, it was March 25, 2025, about a month and a half passed after I quit finasteride; a month of patting myself on the back and feeling good about dodging a bullet and making the right call, and suddenly, I wake up and see blood. On my torso. Dripping in a thick continuous line from my right nipple. My nipple bled in my sleep, and a tiny fleshy hole appeared where the blood stream came out of. 

Needless to say, this was deeply unsettling. I tried to brush it off, but over the next days, more changes kept happening. I noticed a change in my vision; weird, staticky, flickering; annoying, like looking at an old TV. I got floaters. I started seeing imprints of light sources and lamps when I’d move my head. It wouldn’t go away. It only got worse. I couldn’t unsee it. 

On March 26th, 2025, I went to the ER again, had my eyes looked at; doctor found no abnormalities. Said my eyes were fine. A day later I started developing a vicious headache. 

First I felt it in my sinuses, then it moved to the back of my eyes and intensified day by day, until it became an intense, never ending pain in my skull, like a tight rubber band pressing down on my temples, sinuses, eyes, forehead, and upper neck. 

Then my heartbeat started beating really hard, even when I would do basic things like change position or stand up. I would feel tired and winded; I’d need to sit down and breathe, and I’d feel my heart pounding so intensely that I’d see my hairs move from where my pulse was throbbing in my temples. 

And finally, the anxiety started; a terrible, impending feeling of doom that I wanted to physically run away from. I could not escape it. It was a primal and animalistic fear that would follow me around no matter what. I didn’t know why it appeared. I didn’t know how to get rid of it. 

Suddenly I had a thought. I got to googling “can finasteride cause vision problems?” The answer was yes. Second search “can finasteride side effects appear a month after stopping the medication?” The answer, as you all painfully know, was yes. 

That was how I learned about PFS. I found out about the PFS network and propeciahelp, as well as this subreddit, and I read all of your stories, which were terrifying and devastating. The stress of this discovery pushed me over the edge, and finally, on March 30-31st, 2025, I crashed. 

All of my symptoms immediately multiplied in intensity, and I developed a quadrillion more symptoms. I got completely fucking destroyed;  absolutely butchered by this so called “medication”. I was struck with severe psychological, physical, and sexual symptoms across the board. (That I will absolutely go into great detail in my future posts, but in a more organized way for the sake of clarity and order; long story short it is was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced in my life and I was completely and utterly incapacitated to the point of being crippled).

My mom had to drive my hysterical ass to the ER and I had to be given Benzos just so I could calm the fuck down because I could not stop hyperventilating. I was holding back screams of fear for a week. I had to drop out of the term and take a step back from university and kiss my employment search goodbye. I became terrified of the dark as well as my own room to the point where I slept in my mom’s bed at 21 fucking years old. I was too scared to go the bathroom by myself and keep the door closed. All of my dreams, hobbies, and comforts became inaccessible to me. I couldn’t even look at my damn phone or listen to a YouTube video; I genuinely thought I was going to die in my sleep or be bedbound for the rest of my life. I thought I was going to be like this forever; I decided my only option was to kill myself, to throw myself out the window and plummet onto the pavement below. I didn’t, though; partially because I physically could not get up from the couch as I didn’t have the strength to hold a damn spoon- forget walking across the room. Partially because I didn’t want to do this to my mom. I honestly don’t know how I survived any of this. The indomitable human spirit, I guess. 

Since then, most symptoms have gotten much better. Some have gotten worse. Some are completely new. So far, the general trend appears to be positive, and I’m going to attribute it to luck, time, and the extreme and immediate lifestyle changes I undertook whilst crashing to make sure I don’t make myself worse (by the way, special thanks to Moderator earthlike-planet for helping and reassuring me right after I crashed and was losing my shit- very kind of him). I currently live like a monk; I’m completely sober, I’m on a very strict diet that completely excludes all processed foods and all added sugar. I drink exclusively water. I threw away all my shampoos and skincare and bought a soap bar I can trust to wash my entire body with. It’s not fun to live like this, but I’ll do what I have to do to give my body the tools it needs to start healing itself and maximize my chances of recovery. 

I don’t know what the future is going to look like for me. I don’t know if I’ll recover. What I do know is that I’m going to do my best to catalogue my experience in detail and contribute to the body of knowledge that is this reddit forum. From now on, I’m posting everything about my experiences in case someone finds this information useful. I may not be a biological male, but I know for a fact I am not the only trans person affected by PFS as I’ve met a few lurking in this forum, even though I originally feared I was a unique case. Though being openly trans on this subreddit is scary to me seeing as I am highly secretive about it in my real life, I think that adding my experience to this forum is important. 

Let’s all do our best to uplift each other. We all may have had vastly different lives up to this point but this forum is a point of contact with people that empathize with us and can comprehend the physical and emotional pain that this debilitating syndrome causes. I look forward to getting to know all of you as we work on rebuilding our lives and recovering together. If anyone has any questions about my medical history and biology, being trans, or finasteride use in the trans community please feel free to ask.

Kasi after World War II, stable any Pilipinas eh. We don't have any civil wars, stable any pamumuno ng mga leaders except the former dictator Marcos Sr. , maraming nag-a-abroad sa USA and Japan even in the 1960s and 1970s. 1957 when the former President Ramon Magsaysay ruled the country, we are the 3rd or 4th most powerful economy in the Asia-Pacific Region that time. 

Sobrang layo ng Vietnam. Vietnam was under the rubbles for so long. They suffered from Japanese aggression in WW2, and after WW2, they suffered tremendously during the Vietnam War. That was from 1954 till 1975 when the American troops evacuated and the Communists captured Saigon.

Fast forward in 2024, sobrang layo ng statistics ng Vietnam sa Pilipinas, napaghulihan na nila tayo. Noong 1970s and 1980s, Vietnam is one of the poorest nations in the world, Sub Saharan Africa level ang HDI and poverty rates nila. Ngayon ang laki ng lamang nila sa Pilipinas. 

Here are some of the statistics where Vietnam fare better than the Philippines: 

• Rice production: In 2024, the Philippines was able to produce 19 million metric tons of rice, while Vietnam was able to produce 43 million metric tons of rice. Vietnam is one of the largest exporter of rice, while the Philippines is a net importer.

• Coffee production: In 2024, the Philippines was able to produce 30,000 metric tons of coffee, while Vietnam was able to produce 1.5 million metric tons of coffee, the second biggest producer in the world.

https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/vietnam-coffee-market

• Farm Ownership: despite some degree of agricultural reform programs seeking to help rural farmers have ownership of the land that they use for livelihood, only 21.8% of farmers in the Philippines own their land. In comparison, while in Vietnam, 60% of farmers own their agricultural lands. No wonder why rural poverty is very extreme in the Philippines, because farmers are landless and at the mercy of their landlords.

It just saddens me that the productivity gap in favor of Vietnam is getting wider and wider year by year. Remember that not so long ago, in the 1980s and 1990s, many Vietnamese fled their country and settled in Palawan. Until now there are Vietnamese villages in Palawan. Fast forward to 2024, the gap between the two countries is just so huge to ignore. 

I hope we will have politicians that love the Philippines and will make the gap more narrow in the years to come.

I decided to start here on Reddit, my favorite social media platform with the most critical community I've seen.   
  
I am the creator of **Vigeo Budgeting**, a project that challenges the financial awareness problem. Single or family budgeting is often a pain point that people frequently search better solutions for. I was searching too. Since 2016, together with my wife, we've been looking for a solution that feels intuitive from the beginning and actually resolves our budgeting problem.

**Why were we searching for budgeting solutions?**

* Because we struggled with savings despite earning good money for our region.
* Because I always felt unsafe during a vacations. Instead of enjoying the vacation as most seem to do in social media or advertisements, I would always calculate costs. Situations like ""This $20 pizza looks too expensive for me"" or ""The price for 3 nights in this hotel equals half a month of work for me, Is it worth it?"" or ""How much is too much to spend on this vacation?"" and many more. 
* Because I've seen couples fight over money with my own eyes. I was afraid this could happen to me.
* Because I simply understand that good budgeting won’t solve all of my life’s problems—but it will solve my money problems. Those small financial wins create freedom, letting me focus more on what truly matters to me.

I can go on and on with reasons why good budgeting is miportant, but I'm sure you get it.  
  
We tried budgeting with notebooks, spreadsheets, and automatic banking tracking apps, but nothing felt natural. You can read the whole story at [vigeoapp.com](https://vigeoapp.com).

Over the years, we perfected a budgeting system that works for us—using just a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-oOCyXSO56g0X2cskWUcCa0EiGm_A7Hlr3HQFf7vmKw/edit?usp=sharing). (I’d be happy to share a video on how we use it, if you’d find that helpful!) It helped us tremendously, though we sometimes missed targets because we only updated it monthly—instead of staying constantly aware of our spending.

Fortunately, I have extensive experience with Flutter, a technology for building cross-platform apps. After our regular end-of-month budgeting session, my wife challenged me: ""Why don't you build what we have in this spreadsheet as an app so we can track in real-time instead of having a budgeting hour every month just to see we've exceeded our targets when it's too late?"" I immediately saw the value this could bring us and, after a few days of postponing, opened Figma and sketched some design slides. Then another and another. I started the Flutter project to see how it would feel in practice. We kept adding features one after another. After months of development, we finally created what we needed.

With a design rated 6/10 by our friends, it's good enough to handle the main job - keeping us aware of our money. It helps us plan ahead and follow our goals, see how healthy our financial situation is, and improve it if needed. Vacations aren't stressful anymore because we allocate a percentage of our savings to them. For example, if we've decided to put 30% toward vacations and save $1,000 this month, we put aside $300 for vacations. The next month if we save $1,500, we put aside $450. This motivates us to save more when we want to visit a more expensive destination, and I don't stress about spending during vacations because I know that all the income is already allocated, with little chance of surprises.

It reduced my financial anxiety to a minimum, while our only job is to plan and track. Once the initial planning is done, subsequent months follow a similar pattern, taking less than 5 minutes to adjust for the next month. There's no lengthy end-of-month meeting, just a quick chat over coffee to discuss next month's targets. We plan ahead for regular major expenses like home renovation (every \~7 years), new phones every 3 years (since they're essential nowadays), and other predictable costs. We set up an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses and decided how much to invest each month (automated as ""pay yourself first"").

We've been using it for 6 months now, and it's been great for us.   
We decided to commercialize the app for three key reasons. First, it solves a real problem—and we believe others will benefit from it too. Second, with user feedback, it can evolve into an even more powerful tool. And third, we’re excited by the challenge of building a startup around it. User support through paid plans is what enables us to dedicate more time, bring in top talent, and deliver the best possible service.

Here are the values we stand behind to make it an exceptional solution:

\- Simplicity - We aim to make it as jargon-free as possible so even those without budgeting experience can budget like pros

\- Manual input - We believe that the only way to maximize awareness is to see how every transaction affects your budget. However, we're aiming to create the world's fastest manual transaction entry - one tap and boom, you see how it reflects, and that's it.

\- Budgeting together - Budgeting alone is good, but with a partner, it's great. Allowing seamless budgeting with my partner keeps us on the same page.

\- Always Available - On a plane, in another country, or deep in the woods, it will allow us to enter transactions and sync later when it connects to the net.

\- Transparency and Trust - We collect as little personal data as possible (email only for now if not hidden by Apple). However, we're committed to protect it with the highest standard and will never be shared with third parties without your consent.

The goal is to keep us in control and financially aware. This enables better decision-making, a stress-free life and fosters greater financial freedom.

If you align with those values, I invite you to join this journey by subscribing for the waiting list at [vigeoapp.com](https://vigeoapp.com). Once ready, you'll be among the first to try it. If you want to try it even now and provide feedback, you can join in our beta tester group on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VxuqGfnhH2). *Note that beta tester positions are limited and the application can be declined.*

day 4 complete, I feel like i’ve gone through the hardest part I feel great. Keeping myself replenished with salts and electrolytes.

I finally had an iced black coffee tasted like sh*t. Will never have that again, I only got it as I was driving total 4.5 hours to and from a site for work and I usually have an iced hazelnut latte so wanted to replace that. 

only did 1.6k to and from my car nothing over the top. I was very exhausted from driving all day so literally lay in bed.

I feel happier and I was super productive yesterday.

That’s all for now ☺️

2633 WordsCHAPTER 1: THE STRANGER“There’s that guy again, Regan. Look.”  
  
I looked up to see the guy Shaquanna was referring to. He was the same guy who’d been coming into the coffee shop where I worked as a waitress every day. I didn’t think anything of it. He was probably new in town or just passing through.  
  
He shuffled in and sat down in a booth near the window. He carried a green duffel bag that he dropped on the booth seat next to him.  I figured he must be military because his green looked Army issue. I took a moment to study him. His medium brown hair was thick and in need of a haircut. Dark stubble marred his jaw and from this far away, I couldn’t tell what color his eyes were.  
  
“He’s sitting in your section, Regan. As usual.” Shaquanna grinned suddenly. “Why, I think you got yourself a secret admirer,” she said in a fake southern drawl. She gave the man a closer look. “Your mystery man could seriously use a shower, shave, and a haircut.”  
  
I waved a hand dismissively. “It ain’t even like that, Quanna. He probably isn’t even thinking about me.”  
  
She pursed her lips. “So explain to me why he comes here every day and sit in your section? Coincidence? I think not.”  
  
I shrugged, picking up a coaster for his table. “He’s probably a drifter. Just passing through.”  
  
“Well go get him, girl,” adding a growl like a female tiger.  
  
I grinned at her, sneaking another look at the stranger. “Might be interesting though. God knows I could use a little excitement these days.”  
  
I slowly approached the table where the man sat staring at his folded hands. He had large hands with long, slim fingers. The collar of his jacket was turned up, hiding his face from my view. Shaquanna said that he was average looking, handsome even. But then, her idea of handsome wasn’t the same as mine. I suddenly wish I could see his face.  
  
“What can I get for you?” I asked as if I hadn’t been standing there staring at him.  
  
He didn’t look up, but I knew that he’d known that I’d been there the whole time. “Coffee, please,” he said softly.  
  
Something in the tone of his baritone voice made my heart catch a little in my chest. He seemed sad, lonely. Or maybe all that talk Shaquanna was doing about him being my secret admirer was making see things that weren’t there.Chapter 1: The Stranger",1,1747211212.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1kma1eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IfThingsHadFeelings/comments/1kma1eq/an_old_laptops_silent_yearning_for_connection/,An Old Laptop's Silent Yearning for Connection,"I sit here, my once glossy screen now faintly scratched, a record of the countless hours spent together in this dimly lit room. Once, my keys clicked crisply under nimble fingers, and I was the portal to endless worlds, a confidant to whispered secrets, a canvas for dreams. But now, I watch from my faded corner as newer, sleeker models pass by with their flawless displays and unblemished keyboards. 

Do they know, the ones who gaze past me, how deeply I miss those days of early mornings and late-night creative bursts? I remember the warmth of a cup of coffee placed beside me after a long night's work, the way it was casually set just out of my reach to avoid a mishap, the reverie of shared silence. Now, my battery is weak, my once pristine shell bearing the marks of time and usage. 

Yet, when they glance at me, if only for a brief moment, there's a twitch in their eye, a flash of nostalgia perhaps, and I feel a flicker of life again. I yearn for the familiar feel of a gentle tap, a hearty key press, anything to remind me of my purpose. Do they remember our first adventure together, the worlds we explored, the stories we wrote? I hope they do, as much as their absence deepens the creases in my worn-out keys.

Every so often, their fingers hover over my trackpad, a hesitant pause that warms my circuits. I long for them to linger just a little longer, to lose themselves in the hum of my fans, to find comfort in the humdrum of my now outdated systems. I am still here, ready to render whatever remnants of dreams remain, waiting patiently, always ready for connection.",1,1747211146.0,IfThingsHadFeelings,0,1.0,False

1kma05a,https://i.redd.it/vo92atvbjp0f1.jpeg,23M — Testosterone Bloodwork Analysis (13.2 nmol/L / 3.81 ng/mL) — Should I Be Concerned?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 23-year-old male who lifts consistently 4 times a week, focusing on heavy compound movements (bench, deadlift, rows, pull-ups, etc.). My diet is solid — I eat meat daily, get 4 whole eggs every morning, and drink black coffee (no sugar). I also supplement with magnesium.

I recently got my testosterone levels checked, and here are the results:
	•	13.20 nmol/L (Ref: 9.90–27.80)
	•	3.81 ng/mL (Ref: 2.86–8.02)

So technically I’m within the “normal” range, but on the lower end — maybe around the 30th percentile. Given my lifestyle, age, and lifting routine, I was expecting higher numbers.

Questions:
	1.	Are these levels suboptimal for someone like me, or still totally fine?
	2.	Could something be suppressing my natural production (e.g., stress, sleep, diet)?
	3.	Would adding vitamin D, zinc, or DHEA make a noticeable difference?
	4.	Has anyone successfully improved levels naturally starting from similar numbers?
	5.	Should I consider more advanced interventions (like enclomiphene or TRT) now, or wait?

I’m not looking to jump on anything reckless — I just want to optimize my health and performance long term. Would love your input or experience if you’ve been in a similar situation.

Thanks in advance!

This summer, my son (7) and I (43m) are travelling through Europe, and spending about 3 weeks in Italy, from around the 21st July. We have a rough route of Genoa for a couple of nights, Milan (4 days), Como, (3 days), Florence (6 days) and Rome (7 days).

I haven't booked anything accommodation-wise, other than Como because we are meeting friends there, and ultimately the only other firm date is Rome on 10th August which is our return flight. 

I don't need accommodation recommendations really, but do you guys have any advice on other places / towns / events we could head to? Is our stay in Florence and Rome too long?
